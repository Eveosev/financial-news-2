London  has a brand-new theater a
block away from  Buckingham Palace .  The 6 million pound ($7.5 million) St. James Theatre just
opened with “Bully Boy,” about a British soldier named Eddie
(Joshua Miles) who’s to be court-martialed for throwing an Iraqi
boy down a well.  Questioning Eddie is the grand Major Oscar Hadley (Anthony
Andrews from “Brideshead Revisited”), who’s wheelchair-bound
after fighting in the Falklands War.  Penned by comedian-broadcaster Sandi Toksvig, “Bully Boy”
focuses on war’s psychological casualties. Though the play can
get worthy, the acting -- especially Miles as the feral soldier
-- saves the day.  Through Oct. 27 at St. James’s Theatre, 12 Palace Street,
London SW1E 5JA. Information:  http://www.stjamestheatre.co.uk  or
+44-844-264-2140.  Noura is a Middle Eastern restaurant close to the theater.
It serves authentic Lebanese cuisine and  Chateau Ksara  wines.

made under one roof.  The  Royal Academy ’s “Bronze” show does just that.
Cambodian, Nigerian, Italian and Persian sculptures meet an
Etruscan figure who looks uncannily like a Giacometti. Farm
animals (a ram, a turkey) sit near a bronze basketball by  Jeff Koons , its logo proudly emblazoned across the front.  Though the ancients do come out on top, Matisse manages to
turn heads with a row of chunky relief nudes. The show has no
curatorial theme beside its title. What’s next? “Marble?”
Still, there’s beauty galore.  “Bronze” ends Dec. 9 at the Royal Academy of Arts,
Piccadilly. Information:  http://www.royalacademy.org.uk  or call
+44-20-7300-8000.  At the back of the Royal Academy are works donated by
academicians to raise money for its expansion. Highlights
include a glazed Grayson Perry pot picturing academicians such
as Tracey Emin (50,000 - 70,000 pounds), and a Norman Foster
model of his Gherkin skyscraper (3,000 - 5,000 pounds).  The auction is on Oct. 9. The show at 6 Burlington Gardens,
“RA Now,” ends Nov. 11:  http://www.royalacademy.org.uk  or
+44-20-7300-8000.  Saturday Night  The 500 Festival has a reputation for showcasing bands to
watch. Started in 2010 in Devon, southwest  England , the event
moves to London this year for a 14-hour party in Shoreditch.  Leading the lineup is Sylver Tongue, the new electronic
project from Ash guitarist  Charlotte  Hatherley. Other bands

opening ceremony --tell his life story in “Desh.” The show
moves between Britain and his parents’ native  Bangladesh , and
has designs by Tim Yip (who won an Oscar for “Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon”).  “Desh” ends Oct. 9 at Sadler’s Wells. Information:

at Sotheby’s.  The guitarist’s Richter oil-on-canvas, up for grabs in an
Oct. 12 auction and priced as much as 12 million pounds, is on
view from the Sunday before its sale. The 1994 “Abstraktes Bild
(809-4)” -- smudged blocks of red and dark green -- hangs near
other contemporary and Italian works also being sold Oct. 12.  While there, see a Raphael sketch priced at 10 million to
15 million pounds that Peregrine Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire,
is selling in a Dec. 5 London auction to maintain his estate.  At Sotheby’s, 34-35 Bond Street, W1A 2AA. Information:
