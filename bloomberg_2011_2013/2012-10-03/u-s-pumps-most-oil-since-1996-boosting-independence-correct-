(Corrects production total in second paragraph.)  U.S. oil production surged last week
to the highest level since December 1996, reducing the countryâ€™s
dependence on imports as new technology unlocks crude trapped in
shale formations.  Crude output rose by 0.2 percent to 6.52 million barrels a
day in the week ended Sept. 28, the Energy Department reported
today. America met 83 percent of its energy needs in the first
six months of the year, department data show. If the trend
continues through 2012, it will be the highest level of self-
sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
