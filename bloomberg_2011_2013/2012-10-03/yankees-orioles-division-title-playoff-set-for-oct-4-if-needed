The  New York  Yankees and Orioles will
play for the American League East division title tomorrow at
7:10 p.m. Eastern time in Baltimore should they end today with
identical records.  If the Yankees (94-67) lose tonight at home against the
Boston Red Sox and the Orioles (93-68) beat the Tampa Bay Rays,
the teams would end the Major League Baseball regular season
tied atop the AL East.  The one-game playoff, set for Baltimore because the Orioles
have a better division record, will determine which team wins
the AL East and which is awarded a wild-card spot.  The two wild-card teams in each league meet on Oct. 5 to
decide which two advance to the Divisional Series, which start
on Oct. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
