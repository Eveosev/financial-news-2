Marathon Oil Corp.  followed up on its
entry into  East Africa  in July by purchasing a stake in an
Ethiopian license operated by  Tullow Oil Plc. (TLW)   Marathon will pay $40 million to  Agriterra Ltd. , an
agricultural company focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, for a 20
percent stake in the  South Omo Block . A further $10 million will
be paid in the event of a “commercial discovery,” Maputo,
Mozambique-based Agriterra said today in a statement.  Marathon, based in Houston, secured interests in two
exploration blocks in Kenya following an agreement with  Africa
Oil Corp. (AOI)  over the summer. The two agreed to pursue joint
exploration opportunities in Ethiopia at the time. Africa Oil
holds  30 percent  in the block.  “Completion of the agreement is conditional on the consent
of the Ethiopian  Ministry of Mines ,” after Tullow and Africa
Oil waived pre-emption rights, Agriterra said.  Agriterra slumped the most since November 2008 in London,
tumbling 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
