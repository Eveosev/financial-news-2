French President  Francois Hollande â€™s
government is preparing a law to fight home-grown terrorists
that will allow the arrest of suspects for activities outside of
 France .  Under the new law, training in camps abroad, advocating
terrorism on the Internet, and recruiting or organizing
recruitment abroad will be considered as terrorist activities.  The government, which has a majority in both chambers of
the Parliament, wants the law to be voted on before the end of
the year, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told
reporters today in Paris after the weekly Cabinet meeting.  The initiative comes seven months after a self-proclaimed
jihadist murdered seven people, including three Jewish children,
over a nine-day shooting spree in southwestern France.  Mohamed Merah, 23, who traveled to Afghanistan and  Pakistan 
for training, was killed by police in a shoot-out in Toulouse.
The government subsequently increased control over Muslim
clerics and has sought to ban hard-line clerics from entering
the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
