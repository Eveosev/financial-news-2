Portugal  will be able to reach its
budget deficit target of 5 percent of gross domestic product for
this year, said Luis Morais Sarmento, the secretary of state for
the budget.  While the budget deficit goal for this year is off by about
1.6 percentage points, government measures that include a plan
to award a concession of airport operator ANA-Aeroportos de
Portugal SA will help it narrow this gap, Morais Sarmento said
in parliament today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
