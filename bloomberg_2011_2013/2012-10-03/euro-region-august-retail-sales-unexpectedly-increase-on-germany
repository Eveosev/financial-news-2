Euro-area  retail sales  unexpectedly increased for a fourth month in August as demand rebounded in Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy.  Sales in the 17-member euro area rose 0.1 percent from July, when they also gained a revised 0.1 percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had forecast a decline of 0.1 percent, according to the median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. From a year earlier,  sales  dropped 1.3 percent.  European households are tightening their belts as the region’s economy shows signs of a deepening slump. Euro-area unemployment held at a record 11.4 percent in August and  economic confidence  fell last month after the fiscal crisis and budget cuts forced at least five euro nations into recessions.  In  Germany , retail sales rose 0.3 percent from July, when they fell 1 percent, today’s report showed. France reported a drop of 0.8 percent, while sales rose 2.1 percent in  Spain .  The statistics office didn’t report data for  Greece , Cyprus or Italy.
