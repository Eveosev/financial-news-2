Tanzanian economic growth slowed in
the second quarter as  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ’s Geita gold mine
temporarily shut down, causing a drop in production of the
country’s biggest export earner.  Growth dropped to 6.9 percent from 7.1 percent reported in
the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said today
in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s commercial hub.  Growth in mining slowed to 1.2 percent and gold output
dropped to 9,819 kilograms (295,433 ounces) from 10,405
kilograms, the bureau said. “The slow rate has been attributed
to the temporary closure of Geita Gold Mine due to major
maintenance of the plant,” it said.  Tanzania, whose gold shipments were $2.26 billion in the
year through July, vies with Mali to be Africa’s third-biggest
producer of the metal after  South Africa  and Ghana. East
Africa’s biggest economy after  Kenya  has also discovered almost
30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.  “We may see a further deceleration of economic growth in
the third quarter because this is when the budget was tabled,
and government expenditure was low,” Yonoh Mtengule, chief
economist of National Bank of Commerce Ltd., Absa Group’s
Tanzanian unit, said in a phone interview today from  Dar es
Salaam . Growth may accelerate in the fourth quarter, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
