MetroPCS Communication Inc. (PCS) ’s
proposed combination with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Mobile USA
unit is the best outcome for the company and will improve credit
quality, according to KDP Investment Advisors Inc.  The new T-Mobile company will be a standalone entity and is
expected to receive “significant support” from owner Deutsche
Telekom, Scott Dinsdale, an analyst at Montpelier, Vermont-based
KDP, wrote in a report today.  The new company will take on Deutsche Telekom’s
intercompany debt, which will be rolled into a $15 billion 8.5-
year unsecured note to its owner, according to the report.  Holders of MetroPCS debt will have a stronger parent
company to back their bonds, Dinsdale wrote. “This scale, and
cash flow generating ability, along with our implied support
from the parent, leads to a significant improvement in credit
quality and probably a likely exit from the high yield market.”  MetroPCS’s $1 billion of 6.625 percent bonds due November
2020 declined 0.8 cent to 108.3 cents on the dollar to yield
5.36 percent as of 3:48 p.m. in New York, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The notes earlier reached 111.6 cents.  The securities closed at 105.6 cents on the dollar Oct. 1,
the day before Bloomberg News first reported discussions between
the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
