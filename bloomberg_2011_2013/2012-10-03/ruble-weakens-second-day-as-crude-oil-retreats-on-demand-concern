The ruble weakened for a second day
as crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, slid.  The currency fell 0.4 percent to 31.2010 as of 7 p.m. in
Moscow and was little changed versus the euro at 40.2200. The
ruble sank 0.2 percent agains the central bank’s euro-dollar
target basket.  Oil retreated 3.4 percent to $88.85 per barrel in  New York 
after the U.S. Energy Department said crude output rose 11,000
barrels a day to 6.52 million last week, the most since December
1996. Oil and gas account for about 50 percent of Russia’s state
revenue.  “Recent oil price softness” is a “source of risk,”
 Benoit Anne , the head of  emerging markets  strategy at Societe
Generale SA in  London , said in an e-mail.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.6753 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.5938 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell three basis points to 198 basis
points, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.
An index of five-year government bond yields rose four basis
points to 7.569 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
