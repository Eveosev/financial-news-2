German government bonds rose before a
report that may show euro-area services and manufacturing output
dropped to a 39-month low in September.  Benchmark  10-year yields  fell toward the lowest level in
four weeks. Spanish two-year notes fell for the first time in
three days after Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said yesterday he
has no plans to request a bailout soon.  Portugal ’s September
2013 securities were little changed as the nation’s debt agency
prepared to offer to exchange the debt for bonds due in October
2015 as it tries to regain access to long-term debt markets.  “Concern over the economic outlook and Spain will continue
to support demand for safe assets such as German bunds,” said
 Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital
Markets in Edinburgh. “Rajoy yesterday damped hopes that the
sovereign bailout will happen sooner rather than later.”  Germany ’s  10-year yield  declined two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.43 percent at 7:23 a.m.  London  time. The
rate reached 1.42 percent on Sept. 28, the least since Sept. 5.
The 1.5 percent bond due September 2022 gained 0.195, or 1.95
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,289) face amount, to 100.59. The two-
year note yield was at 0.04 percent.  A composite  index  based on a survey of purchasing managers
in both industries in the 17-nation euro area fell to 45.9 in
September, in line with an earlier estimate published on Sept.
20, according to the median forecast of 17 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Yields Rise  Spain’s two-year note yield climbed three basis points to
3.18 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Italian debt
advanced one basis point to 2.22 percent.  European Central Bank policy makers will meet in Ljubljana,
Slovenia tomorrow. All but three of 52 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg predict the central bank will keep its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record-low 0.75 percent.  The yield on Portugal’s September 2013 bond was little
changed at 3.60 percent.  The debt agency will offer to buy the debt maturing in
September 2013 and will sell notes maturing in October 2015, the
Lisbon-based IGCP said yesterday in a statement on its website.
It plans to carry out the offer at 10:30 a.m. in Lisbon.  “The debt swaps in Portugal will be good for risk
appetite,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “We
expect it to prove beneficial in generating some optimism, not
just for Portugal but for other peripherals as well.”  German bunds have returned 3.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities earned 1.6 percent and Portuguese bonds made 44
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
