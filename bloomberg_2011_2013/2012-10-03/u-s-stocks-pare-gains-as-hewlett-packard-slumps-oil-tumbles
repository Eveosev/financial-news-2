U.S. stocks pared gains as Hewlett-
Packard Co. slumped and commodity shares tumbled after crude
fell to a two-month low.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,447.20 at 3:08 p.m. New York time, after climbing as much as
0.6 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 7.91
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,474.45.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  dropped 11 percent to a nine-year low
after the computer maker forecast fiscal 2013 profit that missed
estimates as Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman  said a
turnaround effort won’t happen any time soon.  Energy shares in the S&P 500 slumped 1.5 percent as oil
dropped 4.1 percent after the government reported that U.S.
crude output climbed to the highest level since 1996.  U.S. equities rallied earlier amid data showing better-
than-forecast growth in American employment and service
industries.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
