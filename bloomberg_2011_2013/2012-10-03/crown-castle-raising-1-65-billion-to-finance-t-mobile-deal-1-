Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI)  sold
$1.65 billion of bonds to help finance the purchase of rights to
operate cellular towers of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Mobile USA.  The junk-rated provider of infrastructure for wireless
communications issued the 5.25 percent, senior unsecured notes
due in 2023 to yield 363 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company
will use proceeds from the offering, along with cash and funds
from its revolving credit line, to finance the deal, Houston-
based Crown Castle said today in a statement.  T-Mobile USA, the fourth-largest U.S. carrier, agreed last
month to sell the rights to operate 7,200 towers for $2.4
billion. Crown Castle will have the exclusive right to lease and
operate the antenna towers for about 28 years, with the option
to acquire them at the end of the lease, according to a Sept. 28
statement.  Moody’s Investors Service said in a report today that it
will grade the new bonds B1, signaling the debt is subject to a
high degree of credit risk, while Standard & Poor’s said it will
rate them two steps lower at B-.  Deutsche Telekom is combining its U.S. mobile business with
 MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , the companies said in a statement
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
