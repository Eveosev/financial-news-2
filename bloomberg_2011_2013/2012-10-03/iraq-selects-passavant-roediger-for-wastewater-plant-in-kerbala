Iraq selected Passavant-Roediger
GmbH, a subsidiary of Dubai-based  Drake & Scull International (DSI) 
PJSC, to design and build a sludge treatment system for a
wastewater plant in Kerbala.  The value of the contract using sludge digestion technology
including energy recovery from the organic matter it treats and
biogas generation is 86 million dirham ($23.4 million), the
company said in a statement.  Twelve sludge digesters will be installed as part of the
contract for a project the company expects to be ready next
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
