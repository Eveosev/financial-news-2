Cocoa fell after  Ivory Coast , the
world’s top producer, set the annual price paid to farmers,
easing concern that exports will be disrupted by industry
changes. Sugar, coffee, cotton and orange juice dropped.  Ivorian farmers will get a minimum of 725  CFA francs 
($1.48) for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of  cocoa beans  in the 12
months that started Oct. 1, and a dispute on transportation and
handling fees was resolved, the government has said. A majority
of the crop will be sold before the harvest, and growers will
get 60 percent of the export price, the government said.  “There has been so much speculation around the
organization of the new Ivorian regime over the past year,”
Eric Sivry, the head of agricultural options broking at Marex
Spectron Group, said in a report.  Cocoa for December delivery dropped 1.2 percent to $2,446 a
metric ton at 10:15 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Through yesterday, cocoa climbed 17 percent this year, partly on
Ivorian supply concerns.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.8 percent to
21.41 cents a pound in New York.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery dropped 0.2
percent to $1.8325 a pound.  Cotton futures for December delivery slid 0.7 percent to
71.36 cents a pound.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery declined 0.5
percent to $1.155 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
