U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
said the  Justice Department  will announce “relatively soon”
its policy on recently passed state measures legalizing the use
of marijuana.  “There is a tension between federal law and these state
laws,” Holder said in response to questions after a speech at
the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in  Boston . “I would
expect the policy pronouncement that we’re going to make will be
done relatively soon.”  Voters in Washington and Colorado on Nov. 6 approved ballot
proposals legalizing possession of up to one ounce of marijuana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
