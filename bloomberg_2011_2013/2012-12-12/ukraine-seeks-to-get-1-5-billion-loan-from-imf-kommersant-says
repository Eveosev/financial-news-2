Ukraine wants to get $1.5 billion
from the  International Monetary Fund  as a first tranche of a new
loan agreement in February next year,  Kommersant-Ukraine 
newspaper reported, citing a person with the knowledge of the
matter at the central bank.  Ukraine plans to agree on a $12 billion program with the
Washington-based lender next year, Kommersant reported. Of the
first tranche, $500 million will go to the central bank and $1
billion to the government to help cover existing debt to the
IMF, Kommersant reported.  The central bank expects an agreement with  Russia  to cut
the price of natural gas imports, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
