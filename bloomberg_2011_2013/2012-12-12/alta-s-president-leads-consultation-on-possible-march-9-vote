Malta’s President George Abela will
hold talks with political parties on the timing of general
elections after Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi said Parliament
will be dissolved and the vote may be held in March.  The parliament will be dissolved in January and elections
may be held on March 9, Gonzi told reporters in Valletta
yesterday after a meeting with Abela. The premier, 59, sought to
fix the election date after being defeated last night in a vote
on his budget law in parliament. Lawmakers, including Gonzi’s
ally Franco Debono, voted 35 to 34 against the government.  The opposition  Democratic Party  agreed with Gonzi that the
parliament will be dissolved on Jan. 7, its head Joseph Muscat
told journalists in Valletta after talks with Abela. He declined
to comment on the date of the vote, adding that “the President
will make his own judgement on what is to be done.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
