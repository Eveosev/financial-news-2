Russian power shipments to the
Nordic region via  Finland  will remain at historical lows unless
 Russia  modifies its electricity market rules, a Finnish
researcher said.  Annual Russian power exports to Finland have dropped to
about a third of previous 12 terawatt-hour levels after Russia
introduced a capacity tariff that made it less viable for
exports since August 2011, according to data from Finnish grid
operator Fingrid Oyj.  “To remove the commercial bottleneck that halts power
trade on the Finnish-Russian border, Russia needs to modify its
power market rules, which is unlikely,” Satu Viljainen,
professor at the Lappeenranta University of Technology, said
yesterday in an interview in Helsinki.  In a bid to modernize its electricity industry, Russia uses
a mechanism where consumers subsidize investments made by power
plant operators, while also rewarding operators for guaranteeing
back-up capacity, regardless of whether they produce energy or
not.  Power export monopoly  OAO Inter Rao UES (IRAO)  faces extra costs
for shipping power abroad. In 2010, Finland bought 56 percent of
Russia’s total 18.6 terawatt-hour power exports, followed by a
slump to a 42 percent share last year, and a further decline
year to date, according to  data  from the company.  As a result of a capacity tariff of roughly 25 euros
($32.5) a megawatt-hour levied on exports, it is no longer
viable for the majority of the time for Russia to ship power to
Finland. The import-dependent Nordic country used electricity
imported from its eastern neighbor to meet more than 10 percent
of national demand until last year, according to Fingrid.  “There is a message here to the European Union, that the
union should at least gauge the impact on cross-border trade
before countries introduce capacity tariffs or equivalent new
market designs,” Viljainen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
