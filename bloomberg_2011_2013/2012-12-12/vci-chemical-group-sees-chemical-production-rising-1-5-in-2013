Germany ’s chemical association VCI,
which represents 1,650 chemical companies including  BASF SE (BAS)  and
 Lanxess AG (LXS) , forecast an increase in chemical and pharmaceutical
production of 1.5 percent for next year boosted by demand from
emerging markets.  Selling prices will probably gain 0.5 percent and chemical
sales will rise 2 percent next year, the Frankfurt-based
association said today in a statement. In contrast to this year
in which the industry hired 2 percent more workers, 2013 won’t
generate any growth in job numbers.  VCI confirmed forecasts for this year for chemical
production to decline 3 percent after weakness in the world
economy and the recession in southern  Europe  hurt demand.
Germany’s third largest industry has had to “pay tribute to a
difficult global environment,” the VCI said in today’s
statement.  “2012 was a mixed year for Germany’s chemical industry,”
Karl-Ludwig Kley, president of the VCI, said in the statement.
“Declining demand from Europe contrasted with a strong dynamic
in  emerging markets . The government must now create the
conditions for German chemical companies to improve their global
competitiveness in the coming year.”  In 2012, selling prices probably rose 2.5 percent with
sales stagnating at about 184.2 billion euros ($239.8 billion),
the VCI reiterated. Revenue from abroad increased 2 percent,
while domestic sales dropped 2.5 percent. The number of people
employed rose to 437,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
