Dairy Queen , the ice cream seller
owned by  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , invited Texas A&M University
quarterback Johnny Manziel to work in one of the company’s
outlets at the advice of talk-show host  David Letterman .  Manziel this month became the first freshman to win the
Heisman Trophy in the 78-year history of college football’s top
individual award. The host told Manziel on CBS’s “Late Show
With David Letterman” that if he were the quarterback, he’d
leave school and open a Dairy Queen.  “While the Dairy Queen system does not advocate quitting
college, we welcome Johnny to try his hand at working in one of
our restaurants any time,” said Barry Westrum, executive vice
president of marketing, in a statement today distributed by
Business Wire. “He was called Johnny Football, now he’s Johnny
Heisman. We’re ready to call him Johnny DQ.”  Dairy Queen, which also sells hamburgers and soft drinks,
capitalized on a prior reference to its brand in the world of
sports.  Mark Cuban , owner of the National Basketball
Association’s Dallas Mavericks, accepted the company’s
invitation to manage a store after he said he wouldn’t hire the
league’s supervisor of officials to run a Dairy Queen.  Cuban drew large crowds and throngs of media in 2002 while
working at a restaurant in Coppell, Texas. Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire is led by billionaire Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Warren Buffett , 82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
