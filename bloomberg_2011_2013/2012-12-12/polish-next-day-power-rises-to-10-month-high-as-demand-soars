Polish day-ahead electricity  rose to
the highest level in 10 months as demand was set to soar amid
cold weather and increased flows abroad.  Next-day power added 4.9 percent to 214.75 zloty ($68.32) a
megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s
the highest level since Feb. 14.  Polish power demand was predicted to rise to as much as
25,100 megawatts from 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. tomorrow, 2.5 percent
more than the daily maximum last week, data from the  Polish grid
manager showed.   The country was scheduled to export more electricity to the
Czech Republic,  Germany  and Sweden in the early hours of
tomorrow, and halt imports from Ukraine for most of the day.  PGE SA (PGE)  and  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  were set to keep 442
megawatts of capacity off line tomorrow because of unplanned
outages, the utilities said.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic , Slovakia and Hungary fell 2.2 percent to 67.85 euros
($88.45) a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the
countries’ market operators.  The Czech year-ahead contract declined for a ninth day,
sliding 0.2 percent to 45.20 euros a megawatt-hour, broker data
show. That’s the longest streak of declines since the 2013
contract started trading in September 2010. Polish electricity
for 2013 increased for the second day, adding 0.5 percent to
169.60 zloty a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Link to Company News:{TPE PW <Equity>
