The euro may strengthen against its
U.S. counterpart to the highest level in more than a year if the
shared currency closes the week above a so-called retracement
level of $1.30, according to  UBS AG (UBSN) , citing technical
indicators.  The shared currency closed above $1.3002 yesterday,
signaling an upward trend that may see it test $1.3150, the 38
percent Fibonacci retracement level of a broad bearish move in
the euro from May 2011 to July,  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-
income technical strategy at UBS AG in  London , wrote today in a
note to clients. The euro could rise to $1.3490, its highest
level since Dec. 2, 2011, if it closes the week above $1.30,
Adcock said.  “You have a controlled uptrend and momentum is turning
up,” Adcock said in a telephone interview. “The market is
saying that the correction consolidation phase is ending and
we’re now set to resume a bullish trend.”  The euro increased 0.3 percent to $1.3038 at 10:41 a.m.  New
York  time after earlier gaining 0.4 percent to $1.3053, its
highest level in nearly a week. The 17-nation currency rose 0.7
percent to 108.06 yen.  The euro has weakened 2.2 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar dropped 2.8 percent, and
the yen slid 10.5 percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
