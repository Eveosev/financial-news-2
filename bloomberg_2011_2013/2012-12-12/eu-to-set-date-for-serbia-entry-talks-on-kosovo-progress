The European Union will set a date
for starting  Serbia ’s accession talks by June if the Balkan
nation shows enough progress in mending ties with its former
breakaway province of  Kosovo .  The European Council will ask the European Commission to
begin entry talks if Serbia’s progress is seen as positive in an
EU report due next spring, the Brussels-based council said in
 conclusions  posted on its website after European Affairs
ministers met yesterday to discuss further enlargement.  Serbia and Kosovo must deliver a “visible and sustainable
improvement in relations” so that both “can continue on their
respective European paths,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
