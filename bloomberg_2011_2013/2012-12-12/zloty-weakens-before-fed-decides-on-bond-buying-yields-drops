The zloty declined, snapping a
three-day rally, as investors awaited the U.S.  Federal Reserve ’s
decision on expansionary measures to boost the world’s biggest
economy and Polish inflation data.  The zloty weakened 0.2 percent to 4.0942 per euro as of
10:09 a.m. in Warsaw, reducing this week appreciation’s to 0.6
percent, still the biggest gain among 31 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. The yield on 10-year notes fell four basis
points to 3.84 percent, a record low.  The Federal Reserve may announce later today $45 billion in
monthly Treasury buying to bolster an existing program to buy
$40 billion in mortgage bonds each month, which may send
additional stimulus to the economy, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 49 economists. The debt purchase plan may fuel further
risk appetite and buoy emerging-market assets.  The Fed decision may “determine the zloty’s direction in
the nearest days or even weeks,”  Maciej Reluga , chief economist
at Bank Zachodni WBK SA, wrote in a note today.  Poland’s  inflation  rate is expected to fall to a two-year
low of 2.9 percent in the 12 months to November from 3.4 percent
in October, according to the median forecast from a Bloomberg
survey of 32 economists before the data are published tomorrow.  Such a decline may “justify deeper interest rate cuts,”
 Marcin Mrowiec , chief economist at  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , wrote in a
note today. Policy makers have cut  interest rates  twice in as
many months, lowering the reference rate to 4.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
