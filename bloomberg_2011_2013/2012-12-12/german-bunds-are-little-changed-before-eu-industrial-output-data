Greece ’s 10-year bonds advanced for
a fifth day, pushing the yield to the  lowest  since the country’s
debt was restructured in March, after the nation said it has
reached a deal to buy back some of its sovereign securities.  Ten-year bonds pared their gains on concern that optimism
over the purchases had pushed prices too high. The buyback paves
the way for European officials to disburse the next tranche of
international aid for Greece. German bunds fell for a third day
as demand for the safest assets declined. Austrian and French
10-year bonds also dropped. Italian securities climbed as
borrowing costs at an auction of one-year bills fell to the
lowest in nine months.  “The best time to have got long Greece bonds was ahead of
the buyback,” said  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed markets
debt strategy at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam, referring to a bet
an asset will rise. “From here I’d expect them to drift, most
of the rally has happened.”  Greek 10-year yields fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 13.15 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
dropping to as low as 12.46 percent. The 2 percent security
maturing in February 2023 rose 0.225, or 2.25 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,304) face amount, to 43.95 percent of face value.  Investors tendered Greek bonds with a face value of 31.9
billion euros, Greece’s Public Debt Management Agency said in a
statement on its website today. The weighted-average purchase
price to be paid is 33.8 percent of face value, according to the
statement.  Greek Buyback  Greece set prices for the repurchase of its government debt
ranging from 32.2 percent of face amount for securities due in
2037 to 2042, to 40.1 percent for bonds maturing in 2023.  Greece is using a 10 billion-euro loan from  Europe ’s
bailout fund to retire debt issued earlier this year in the
biggest sovereign restructuring in history. International
bailout funds to Greece have been frozen since June.  “They needed to get the buyback out of the way to
crystalize some debt relief and that paves the way for the
finance ministers to look at the aid,” said Owen Callan, an
analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Dublin.  Volatility on Italian debt was the highest among euro-area
nations tracked by Bloomberg, followed by those of Ireland and
 Portugal , according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-
year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  Italian Yields  Italian 10-year yields fell eight basis points to 4.64
percent, while the rate on the nation’s two-year note dropped 13
basis points to 2.10 percent.  Italy sold 6.5 billion euros of 364-day bills at an average
yield of 1.456 percent, the  lowest  since March 13 and down from
1.762 percent at the previous auction on Nov. 13. Investors bid
for 1.94 times the amount of bills offered, up from 1.76 times
last month.  “The bill auction was very successful,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior fixed-income strategist at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam. “Investor demand for the front-end of the curve is
still present.”  Italy is scheduled to sell bonds maturing in 2015 and 2026
tomorrow.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose two basis points to 1.34
percent after climbing to 1.35 percent, the most since Dec. 6.  The rate on similar-maturity Austrian bonds increased one
basis point to 1.73 percent and that on French debt also climbed
one basis point to 1.97 percent.  German bonds returned 4.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italy’s
debt gained 19 percent and Spain’s rose 4.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
