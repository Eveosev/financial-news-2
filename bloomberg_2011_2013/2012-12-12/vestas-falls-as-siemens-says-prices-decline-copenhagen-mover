Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
largest wind turbine maker, was the  biggest decliner  on the  OMX
Copenhagen 20 index (KFX)  today after its main European rival said
prices continue to decline.  Vestas fell as much as 3 percent, the most since Dec. 6.
The stock of the Aarhus, Denmark-based company retreated 1.8
percent to 29.97 kroner at 11:16 a.m. in the Danish capital with
trading volume at 24 percent of the three-month daily average.  Vestas is deepening job cuts to return to profitability as
increased competition from China and lower government subsidies
for green energy cap orders.  Siemens AG (SIE)  executives, including
Michael Suess, the head of the company’s energy unit, said late
yesterday at an investor meeting that turbine prices are falling
4 percent to 5 percent.  The wind turbine industry suffers from overcapacity that is
“limiting pricing power in a low growth environment,”  JPMorgan
Cazenove  said in a note today. “The environment looks a lot
more like the 1990s to us than the strong cycle in the last
decade.”  Siemens said yesterday at its capital markets day in
Charlotte, N.C., that the wind industry unit suffers from higher
pricing pressure than its other energy divisions, which include
power transmission and oil and gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
