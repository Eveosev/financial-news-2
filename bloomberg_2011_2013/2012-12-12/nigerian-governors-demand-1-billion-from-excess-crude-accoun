Nigeria’s 36 state governors want a
$1 billion payout from the country’s crude oil savings account
to fund projects, said Sokoto state Deputy Governor Mukhtar
Shagari.  The governors want the federal government to disburse “at
least about $1 billion from the excess crude account to help the
state governments to meet up with their financial
responsibilities as the year is coming to an end, because most
of the states have contracts that are ongoing and are very
important to the people of this country,” Shagari, who spoke on
behalf of the governors, said today in an e-mailed statement
from Abuja, the capital.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, relies on crude
exports for about 95 percent of its foreign-currency earnings
and 80 percent of government revenue. The West African country
with more than 160 million people saves oil revenue above the
benchmark budgeted price in the excess crude account. Its
balance stands at $9 billion, Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala said on Dec 3.  While a lawsuit filed by the states challenging the federal
government’s use of the account’s funds will continue, the
governors will continue to hold talks with the government and
hope that “perhaps, we may come to some decisions along the
way,” Shagari said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
