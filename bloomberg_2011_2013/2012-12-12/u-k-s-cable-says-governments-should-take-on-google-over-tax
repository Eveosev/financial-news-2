U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said governments should coordinate across borders to take on
companies including  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and make them pay more tax.  He spoke after Google Chairman  Eric Schmidt  said he was
“very proud” of his company’s structure, which helped it avoid
about $2 billion in worldwide income taxes by shifting revenue
to a Bermuda shell company. “It’s called capitalism,” Schmidt
said.  “It may well be, but it’s certainly not the job of
government to accommodate it,” Cable told reporters in  London .
“Governments have been very much behind the curve. We operate
national systems of enforcement in a world where companies
operate on a global scale. On behalf of taxpayers, we’ve got to
retrieve the situation.”  Cable said he expected the Group of Eight leading
industrial economies to work on coordinating tax collection.
Britain is in the chair of next year’s meeting. Asked if
 Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) ’s announcement that it had decided to
voluntarily pay more tax in the U.K. had put a lid on the issue
of avoidance, he said, “absolutely not.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
