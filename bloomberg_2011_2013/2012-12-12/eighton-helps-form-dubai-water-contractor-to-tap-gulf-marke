The Leighton Group, involved in the
construction of three of  Australia ’s largest desalination
plants, has helped form a water and environmental contracting
company in Dubai to tap demand in the Gulf region.  The Habtoor Leighton Group joined last month with John

companies including John Holland were involved in Australia’s
Sydney, Melbourne and Gold Coast seawater desalination plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
