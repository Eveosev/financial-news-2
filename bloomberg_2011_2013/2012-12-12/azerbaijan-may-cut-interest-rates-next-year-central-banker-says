Azerbaijan ’s central bank, which cut
borrowing costs this month, may ease monetary policy further in
2013 if the inflation rate remains low.  The regulator trimmed the benchmark refinancing rate to 5
percent from 5.25 percent on Dec. 7 to help stimulate growth in
areas of economy outside the  energy industry . Nine-month
inflation slowed to 1.5 percent from 8.4 percent a year earlier,
the State Statistics Committee said in October.  “Azerbaijan’s inflation rate has been very low this
year,” central bank Chairman Elman Rustamov told reporters
today in the capital, Baku. “If the trend continues, we may
decide to cut the refinancing rate again next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
