Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
 U.S. bank  by assets, was accused in a lawsuit by Swisscanto
Asset Management AG of misleading the Swiss firm about the
bank’s financial condition from 2006 to 2009.  Swisscanto, based in Zurich, filed a lawsuit today in
Manhattan federal court, accusing New York-based Citigroup and
its former officers and directors of making deceptive comments
about losses related to mortgage securities. Swisscanto and
Swisscanto International seek unspecified damages.  “Due to defendants’ repeated material untrue statements
and non-disclosure of material information to investors,
plaintiffs purchased Citi securities at inflated prices,”
Swisscanto said in its complaint.  A class-action, or group, lawsuit over essentially the same
claims has been pending in Manhattan federal court, according to
the complaint. Swisscanto on Dec. 4 asked to be excluded from
the class, according to the complaint.  “We believe the suit is without merit and will defend
against it vigorously,”  Shannon Bell , a spokeswoman for New
York-based Citigroup, said in an e-mail.  The suit is Swisscanto v. Citigroup, 12-cv-9050, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
