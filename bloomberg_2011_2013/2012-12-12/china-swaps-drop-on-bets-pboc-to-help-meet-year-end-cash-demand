China ’s  interest-rate swaps  fell for
a second day on speculation the central bank will add enough
funds to the financial system via reverse-repurchase operations
to meet year-end cash demand.  The People’s Bank of China injected a net 11 billion  yuan 
($1.8 billion) into the financial system last week. The monetary
authority gauged demand for a sale of seven- and 14-day reverse-
repo contracts tomorrow, according to a trader at a primary
dealer required to bid at the auctions.  “In the near term, money-market rates will still be
determined by the PBOC’s reverse repos, and banks will probably
keep sufficient funding for the year-end,” said Weisheng He, a
Shanghai-based strategist at Citigroup Inc. “I don’t expect
much volatility in the money market around year-end.”  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost to receive
the seven-day repo rate, fell two basis points, 0.02 percentage
point, to 3.34 percent as of 9:59 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s upcoming central economic work conference will
leave policies unchanged, China Business News reported today,
citing an unidentified person. The meeting, at which officials
may set the 2013 growth goal, could be held this month, China
Business News reported Nov. 26.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, was little changed at 3.02 percent in Shanghai,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
