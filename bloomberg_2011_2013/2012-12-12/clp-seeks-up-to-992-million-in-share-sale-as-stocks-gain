CLP Holdings Ltd. (2) , Hong Kong’s
biggest electricity supplier, is seeking to raise as much as
$992 million in a share sale as investor sentiment improves
after the city’s benchmark index rose to a 16-month high.  The company is offering 120.3 million shares at HK$62.90 to
HK$63.90 apiece, according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg
News. The price range represents a discount of 4.9 percent to
6.4 percent to its closing share price yesterday.  CLP fell 0.3 percent to HK$67.20 in Hong Kong yesterday.
The stock has risen 1.7 percent this year, compared with a 22
percent gain for the Hang Seng Index. The benchmark index
climbed for a third day yesterday, extending its highest close
since August 2011, on speculation the Federal Reserve will
announce another round of quantitative easing at a meeting.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., UBS AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
are arranging the sale, the document shows.  Winifred Wong, a spokesman for CLP, declined to comment on
the reasons for the share sale.  CLP plans to raise net charges for electricity in Hong Kong
by 5.9 percent in 2013 because of higher fuel costs, the company
said Dec. 11. It estimated 2012 capital spending at HK$7.88
billion, according to a separate filing to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
