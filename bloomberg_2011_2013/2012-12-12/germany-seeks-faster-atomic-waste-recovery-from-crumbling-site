Germany  plans to speed up recovery
of atomic waste costing at least 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion)
from a crumbling underground storage site to stop radioactivity
leaking into groundwater before the facility is closed.  Factions of the four main political parties issued a  draft
bill  today in Berlin to remove regulatory hurdles to recovery
from the Lower Saxony site, said Maria Flachsbarth, a lawmaker
in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union . It
will be debated tomorrow and may be passed in March, she said.  “We all agree that the recovery must happen faster,” said
Sylvia Kotting-Uhl, a politician for the  Green Party . “This
will still take years and decades.”  The federal government will cover costs that may reach at
least 4 billion euros, said Deputy Environment Minister Ursula
Heinen-Esser. The  Asse  site in a former salt mine holds 126,000
barrels of weak and mid-level waste, including contaminated
equipment and clothing from workers in the nuclear industry.  With about 12,000 liters (3,166 gallons) of underground
water leaking into Asse  a day  and eroding its walls, Germany
plans to relocate waste before the water seeps back out into
aquifers. The Federal Office for Radiation Protection took over
Asse in 2009 after the former manager failed to report seepage
threatening the structure, and unauthorized storage of material.  To contact the reporter on this story:
