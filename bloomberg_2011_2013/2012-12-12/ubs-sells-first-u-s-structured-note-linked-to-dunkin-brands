UBS AG (UBS)  sold $3.4 million of one-year
securities linked to  Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc., (DNKN)  in what may be
the first U.S. structured note tied to the fast-food chain.  The securities, issued Dec. 7, yield 9 percent a year as
long as the stock doesn’t fall below 75 percent of its initial
price of $23.58, according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The notes are redeemed
quarterly if the stock is at or above its initial value, and
investors can lose their entire investment if the shares
plummet. The bank distributed the notes for a 1.5 percent fee.  Dunkin’ Brands Group, the parent company of the namesake
coffee chain, has gained 29 percent this year through yesterday
to close at $32.11.  Single-serving portion packs of coffee have driven an
increase in same-store sales for the company, said Marc Riddick,
an analyst at Williams Capital Group LP in  New York . “It’s been
doing better than expected,” he said. Revenue is expected to
increase 2 percent to $171.9 million by the end of the quarter
from a year earlier, according to the average of analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
