The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) ’s
biggest weekly rally in more than a year is failing to stem
equity outflows as the number of trading accounts containing
funds declined to the lowest in two years.  The number of funded stock accounts dropped by about 49,000
to 55.55 million in the week to Dec. 7, the lowest level since
the week to Nov. 26, 2010, regulatory  data  compiled by Bloomberg
showed today. That’s down from a peak of 57.28 million such
accounts in June 2011. The Shanghai Composite Index jumped 4.1
percent last week, the most since October 2011, after sinking to
an almost four-year low on Dec. 3.  The Shanghai Composite, comprising mainly yuan-denominated
A shares, is heading for a third straight year of losses amid
concern a seven-quarter economic slowdown may drag on earnings
and a possible wave of initial public offerings would draw funds
from existing equities. There are now about 112 million empty
stock accounts, the data show. The  Shanghai  gauge retreated 0.2
percent to 2,073.3 at 1:15 p.m. local time.  “If there’s reforms such as the suspending of IPOs and
better economic data, investors will naturally return,” Zhang Yanbin, an analyst with Zheshang Securities Co. said in a phone
interview in Shanghai. “We are only at the start of a stock
rebound so we haven’t seen big returns yet. Once those returns
start happening on a greater scale, we can expect investors to
come back.”  Chinese companies listed on the mainland trade at the
biggest  discount  to their Hong Kong-listed counterparts since
January 2011, according to an index from Hang Seng Bank Ltd.,
signaling global investors are more positive than locals toward
the nation’s shares.  Trading Value  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
listed in  Hong Kong  has climbed 23 percent since Sept. 5, while
the Shanghai Composite is 5.7 percent above its Dec. 3 low. A
shares are restricted to domestic investors and a limited number
of foreign institutions, while their H-share counterparts are
open to overseas investors. The Hang Seng China index rose 1.1
percent today.  The number of stock-trading accounts that made transactions
in A shares last week increased to 7.3 million from 6.1 million
the week before, and up from 5.6 million in the week to Nov. 23,
which was the lowest since at least January 2008, excluding
weeks that had holidays.  The  value  of shares traded on the Shanghai exchange rose to
68.1 billion  yuan  ($10.9 billion) yesterday after falling to
33.1 billion yuan on Nov. 26, the least in four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
