An  Occupy Wall Street  protester
pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in a case headed for an
appeals court over the right to privacy for posts on the social
media service Twitter Inc.  Malcolm Harris, 23, today in state Criminal Court in
Manhattan admitted actions during an October 2011 protest on the
 Brooklyn  Bridge that resulted in about 700 arrests. He was
sentenced to six days of community service.  Prosecutors subpoenaed about three months of Twitter
messages Harris posted around the time of the protest. Judge
 Matthew Sciarrino  rejected motions by Twitter and Harris to
block the state’s request for the tweets.  Twitter, based in  San Francisco , released the posts in
September after being threatened with a charge of contempt of
court. The company appealed Sciarrino’s ruling to a state
appeals court, seeking a judgment on whether it should have the
burden of responding to subpoenas for its users’ messages.  Harris’s lawyer, Martin Stolar, said today that Harris also
plans to appeal.  “It’s really about limiting future ways these subpoenas
are going to be used,” Harris, a resident of Brooklyn, said
about the appeal in an interview after his plea hearing today.
“Social media’s not a testing ground for prosecutorial
theories.”  The prosecutors said the police ordered the demonstrators
to leave the bridge because they were disrupting traffic. The
protestors said the police had given them permission to be
there.  The criminal case is People v. Harris, 11-80152,  New York 
 Criminal Court  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
