LPL Financial LLC (LPLA) , the largest
independent U.S. broker-dealer by revenue, was accused by
Massachusetts regulators today of dishonest and unethical
business practices and failure to supervise agents who made
improper sales.  The complaint relates to sales of seven non-traded real
estate investment trusts in violation of state and company
rules, according to a statement from the state’s senior
securities watchdog, Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin. LPL earned at least $1.8 million in commissions on the
sales from 2006 through 2009, the state said.  “At their core, non-traded REIT products operate through
an immensely complex affiliated and subsidiary structure rife
with conflict,” Galvin’s complaint said. “LPL’s lack of
adequate training and supervision only exacerbated problems.”  LPL, which is based in  Boston , provides brokerage, advisory
and technology services to more than 13,000 financial advisers,
according to its website. San Francisco-based Hellman & Friedman
and TPG Capital, the Fort Worth, Texas-based firm founded by
 David Bonderman , are the company’s largest shareholders,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We believe the claims included in the complaint are
substantially overstated,” Betsy Weinberger, a spokeswoman for
LPL, said in an e-mailed statement. “LPL Financial takes
protection of investors’ interests seriously.”  The complaint seeks a cease-and-desist order, censure and
restitution for investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
