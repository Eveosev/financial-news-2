Gulf Coast spot gasoline
strengthened after a fire shut a crude unit at Motiva
Enterprises LLC’s Port Arthur,  Texas , refinery.  Conventional, 87-octane  gasoline  on the Gulf Coast
increased 1.25 cents to a discount of 24 cents a gallon to
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 2:01 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount Dec. 10
reached 29.5 cents a gallon, the lowest level since Bloomberg
began assessing the grade in May 1991.  The crude unit, which has a capacity of 325,000 barrels a
day, was processing about 240,000 barrels before the fire, a
person with knowledge of the situation said.  Motiva expects to return the unit to normal operations in
an “expeditious manner,” Kimberly Windon, a Houston-based
spokeswoman for Motiva, said in an e-mail. The fire was “very
small and was rapidly extinguished.”  “I think the spot market reacted bullishly,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “Now
that it turns out it was just minor and that they’re going to be
restarting the unit shortly, I think the impact is going to be
quite mitigated.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf fell 0.37 cent to a
discount of 1.25 cents a gallon to heating oil futures on the
Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
