United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
more than doubled its offering of junk-rated securities backed
by passenger planes, issuing $425 million of the debt.  The world’s largest airline sold 6.125 percent pass-through
certificates maturing in 2018 through its Continental Airlines
unit after estimating earlier today in a filing that the deal
size would be $200 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Class C certificates, which rank below two other
portions of previously issued debt, will be secured by 42  Boeing
Co. (BA)  aircraft, Continental said later today in an updated filing.
The certificates were rated four levels below investment grade
at B1 by Moody’s Investors Service.  A portion of the sale’s proceeds will help finance the
purchase of 19 new Boeing planes scheduled for delivery from
December 2012 to September 2013, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
