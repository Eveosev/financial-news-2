London ’s Heathrow airport said
almost 150 flights were cancelled today after fog disrupted
flights and planes operated by British Airways iced up.  Some 76 arrivals and 72 departures were scrapped before
 Europe ’s busiest airport was able to open for traffic. Delays
are currently running at about 30 minutes for incoming flights
and just under one hour for outbound services, Heathrow
spokeswoman Jan Singleton said today by telephone.  Aircraft operated by British Airways, Heathrow’s top 
carrier, that had been parked up overnight suffered icing in 
their engines, spokeswoman Nicola Pearson said today by 
telephone.  At London City airport, popular with travellers to and from
the U.K. capital’s financial district, 22 flights were lost
before visibility improved at about 11 a.m., spokeswoman
 Charlotte  Beeching said, adding that there could be further
delays and disruption.  Weather forecasters said freezing fog was widespread across
central, eastern and southern Britain and would be slow to clear
because of a temperature inversion that caused some of the
moisture to freeze and fall as fine snow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
