European Union leaders will press
for a June 2013 agreement on how to handle failing banks and 
how to set minimum standards for deposit guarantee schemes,
according to draft conclusions for this week’s summit.  Leaders will urge nations to agree on the two measures by
March 31 and then reach an accord with the European Parliament
by mid-year, according to Dec. 12 draft conclusions obtained by
 Bloomberg News . The timeline is a change from a Dec. 3 draft,
which aimed to wrap up all agreement on the measures by March.  The leaders also will call for the European Commission in
2013 to submit a proposal for a “single resolution mechanism”
for nations that take part in common bank supervision, the draft
document said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
