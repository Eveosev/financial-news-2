Carl Johnson will become the first
full-time field official in the National Football League, moving
from his job as vice president of officiating after the Super
Bowl title game.  Johnson is the first person hired for full-time positions
created this season by the labor agreement with the NFL Referees
Association following a lockout, the league said in a news
release.  In his front-office position, he was involved with
overseeing replacements when the league locked out its regular
officials at the start of this season. Many of the replacements
were criticized by players, coaches and news media members for a
lack of knowledge of the rules and inconsistent calls on the
field.  “Carl Johnson’s experience on the field and in New York
made him uniquely qualified to help implement the new program of
a limited number of full-time game officials,” Ray Anderson,
the NFL’s executive vice-president of football operations, said
in a news release.  Johnson, who joined the NFL’s front office as head of
officiating in 2010, previously spent nine seasons as a line
judge, and worked the Super Bowl between the New York Giants and
New England Patriots after the 2007 season.  Johnson, who will be based in  Louisiana  with his family,
will help train and develop other officials, scout for new hires
and assist the league’s Competition Committee, which makes the
rules, the NFL said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
