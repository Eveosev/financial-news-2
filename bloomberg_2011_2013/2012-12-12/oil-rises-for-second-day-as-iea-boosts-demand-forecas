Crude gained for a second day in  New
York  after the  International Energy Agency  increased its demand
forecast and OPEC kept its production target unchanged.  Futures climbed as much as 1.6 percent after the IEA raised
fourth quarter and 2013 consumption estimates on signs of a
demand rebound in  China , the world’s second-largest oil user.
OPEC maintained output levels for a second time this year.
Oil extended gains after the  Federal Reserve  expanded its asset-
purchase program.  “The IEA’s demand revision is clearly a very bullish move,
and it suggests maybe the economy is better than people thought,
especially China,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts .
“People have been expecting that there will be no change in
OPEC production.”  Crude for January delivery rose $1.23, or 1.4 percent, to
$87.02 a barrel at 12:39 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices, which touched $87.20 in intraday trading, are
down 12 percent this year. They are heading for the first annual
decrease since 2008.  Futures rebounded yesterday after declining for five days,
the longest streak of losses since Oct. 24. Futures breached a
technical resistance level at $86.70, an indicator that prices
may increase further, said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market
strategist and founder of Iitrader.com in  Chicago .  “Oil is on the bottom part of the range and buyers are
coming back to the market,” he said. “The IEA boosts its
demand forecast, and it’s supportive for prices.”  Brent Gains  Brent for January settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange gained $1.94, or 1.8 percent, to $109.93
a barrel.  Global oil consumption in the final three months of 2012
will average 90.5 million barrels a day, about 435,000 barrels,
or 0.5 percent, more than previously forecast, the Paris-based
IEA said in a monthly report today. Demand will expand by
865,000 barrels a day in 2013 to 90.5 million, adding 110,000
barrels to a previous outlook.  “Markets have grown somewhat more optimistic about the
Chinese economy as confidence indicators recently turned
expansionary after a long period in the doldrums,” the IEA said
in the report.  OPEC, which pumps about 40 percent of the world’s oil, kept
its production limit at 30 million barrels a day, a level it now
exceeds, according to estimates from the group and from
Bloomberg.  Standing Pat  “Everything will stay as it is,”  Ali al-Naimi ,  Saudi
Arabia ’s oil minister, said after the meeting in Vienna. “We
respond to customer demand. Whatever the customers want, we will
give them.”  Production from all 12 OPEC nations slid to an 11-month low
of 30.78 million barrels a day last month, OPEC’s monthly report
showed yesterday, citing secondary sources for the data. That’s
still above the official cap and about 1.03 million barrels a
day more than the projected average demand for OPEC crude next
year, according to the report.  OPEC pumped 31.5 million barrels a day in November,
according to Bloomberg estimates.  Oil also advanced after the Fed said it will buy $45
billion a month in  Treasury securities  to help boost economic
growth. The Fed’s plan for Treasury purchases matched the
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased for a sixth day.  U.S. Supplies  Crude reduced gains after the Energy Department said
 supplies  rose 843,000 to 372.6 million in the week ended Dec. 7.
Inventories were forecast to decrease 2.5 million barrels,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Stockpiles of gasoline grew 5 million barrels to 217.1
million, the most since April 6. They were forecast to increase
2 million barrels, according to the survey.  Supplies of distillate fuels, including heating oil and
diesel, rose 3 million barrels to 118.01 million. They were
expected to grow 1.1 million.  “We have bearish numbers across the board and we saw a
downward reaction in prices,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst
at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “Gasoline is looking
oversupplied and at some point it might be reasonable to
conclude that it’s a  bear market .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
