CLP Holdings Ltd. (2) , Hong Kong’s
biggest electricity supplier, plans to raise net charges by 5.9
percent in 2013, according to a company statement.  CLP and Hongkong Electric Co., a unit of  Power Assets
Holdings Ltd. (6)  and the city’s other electricity supplier,
disclosed plans to increase energy tariffs at a meeting of the
Legislative Council yesterday. Hongkong Electric plans to boost
charges by 2.9 percent, the company told lawmakers.  “We are conscious of the need to keep the 2013 adjustment
to a reasonable level,” CLP Managing Director Richard Lancaster
said in an e-mailed statement. CLP will introduce a rebate to
encourage conservation and help customers save energy, he said.  Higher fuel costs prompted the tariff increase, according
to the statement. About 35 percent of domestic customers and 44
percent of small businesses won’t have to pay more because of
the new rebate. CLP estimated 2012 capital spending at HK$7.88
billion ($1.02 billion), according to a separate filing to Hong
Kong’s stock exchange yesterday.  CLP cut its proposed electricity tariff increase to 4.9
percent from 9.2 percent last year after criticism from
government officials including former Hong Kong Chief Executive
Donald Tsang.  CLP shares fell 0.2 percent to HK$67.30 as of 10:19 a.m. in
Hong Kong, while the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 0.7
percent. Power Assets fell 0.6 percent to HK$67.10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
