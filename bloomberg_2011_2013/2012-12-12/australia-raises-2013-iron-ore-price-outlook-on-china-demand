Australia , the world’s biggest iron-
ore exporter, raised its price estimate for next year on
expectation that infrastructure projects and stimulus spending
by  China , the world’s biggest buyer, will boost demand.  Prices will average $106 a metric ton in 2013, compared
with a September estimate of $101 a ton, the  Bureau of Resources
and Energy Economics  said in a report today. Prices are set to
average $128 a ton in 2012 from $126 a ton forecast in September,
the Canberra-based bureau said. Australia may ship 481 million
tons in 2012 and 543 million tons in 2013, from 483 million tons
and 528 million tons predicted in September, it said.  Iron ore  climbed yesterday to the highest price in more
than four months on signs China will rebound after a seven-
quarter slowdown. Industrial output and retail sales rose faster
than economists estimated, data showed Dec. 9, bolstering
prospects for a sustained pickup. China imported 65.78 million
tons of the ore last month, the customs bureau said Dec. 10, the
second-highest level after a record 68.97 million tons in
January 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The mood is improving,” said  Tom Price , a commodities
analyst at UBS AG in Sydney. “After Chinese New Year through to
the middle of the year, there’s a lift in raw materials trade,
steel production rates lifts and the whole industrial sector
comes back to life.”  Chinese Imports  China’s iron-ore  imports  will climb 5.3 percent to 769
million tons next year, today’s report said. The country’s
crude-steel production will gain to 732 million tons next year
from 704 million tons in 2012, it said.  Iron-ore  exports  from Australia advanced 7.6 percent to a
record 44.2 million tons in October, according to government
data compiled by Bloomberg. China’s industrial production
climbed 10.1 percent in November from a year earlier and retail
sales growth accelerated to 14.9 percent, according to the
country’s statistics bureau.  Prices in the first half of 2013 are expected to remain
around current levels, before increasing in the fourth quarter
of 2013 in line with an expected increase in steel consumption
demand, the  report  said. China approved plans including building
of roads, subways and extra spending on railways in September.  The country’s crude-steel production, the biggest in the
world, gained 14 percent in November from a year earlier, the
National Bureau of Statistics said Dec. 11. Output climbed to
57.47 million tons last month, it said.  Gross domestic product  will increase 7.7 percent in the
October-December period following a third-quarter gain of 7.4
percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The bureau’s forecast referred to  iron ore  with 62 percent
content free-on-board Australia. The same grade of ore delivered
to the Chinese port of Tianjin rose 1.2 percent to $124.90 a dry
ton yesterday, the highest since July 20, according to a gauge
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  Iron ore is measured in dry tons, or metric tons less
moisture. At Tianjin port moisture can account for 8 percent to
10 percent of the ore’s weight.  To contact the reporter for this story:
