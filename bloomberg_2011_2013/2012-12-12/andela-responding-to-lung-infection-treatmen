Doctors treating former South
African President Nelson Mandela for a lung infection are
“satisfied” with his progress in the past 24 hours, President
Jacob Zuma’s office said today.  Mandela, 94, was admitted to a undisclosed hospital in the
capital,  Pretoria , on Dec. 8 for a recurring infection. He
became the nation’s first black president after all-race
elections in 1994 that brought an end to white-minority rule.
Mandela stepped down voluntarily in 1999.  “Doctors attending to former President Mandela have
reported that he has made progress during the past 24 hours and
they are satisfied with the way he is responding to treatment,”
Zuma’s office said.  Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison for opposing the
apartheid government, had exploratory surgery for an abdominal
complaint in February and was hospitalized for an acute
respiratory infection a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
