Estonia’s parliament approved  next
year’s budget  that seeks to lower the fiscal deficit even as the
opposition accuses the government of failing to tackle poverty
and ease the pace of inflation.  Lawmakers voted 55-37 today to back the budget in the final
of the three readings in the capital, Tallinn. The budget is
based on a 2013 forecast for gross domestic product growth of 3
percent and sets a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP, compared with
a planned shortfall of 1.2 percent this year, according to an e-
mailed statement from the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
