Ethanol  production  in the U.S. fell
1.3 percent to 824,000 barrels a day last week, the lowest in a
month.  Stockpiles surged 3.6 percent to 20 million barrels, the
highest level since June 29, an Energy Department report
released in  Washington  today showed, while  imports  tumbled to
12,000 barrels a day from 92,000 the previous week. Thatâ€™s down
29 percent from a year earlier.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 90 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, up from 87 percent in the seven days
ended Nov. 30, the lowest since Jan. 6.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 0.8 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $2.331 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
stretching a streak of declines to five days, the longest since
Aug. 28. Futures have climbed 5.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
