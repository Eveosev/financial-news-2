Russia , which became a sugar
exporter for the first time last season, more than doubled its
shipments of beet pulp and molasses in this year’s first 10
months, the  Sugar Producers’ Union  said.  Exports climbed above 1 million metric tons from 407,000
tons a year earlier, the industry group said today on its
website. Increased output drove the gain along with higher grain
prices that pushed makers of animal feedstuffs to buy more beet
products, it said.  Shipments included 517,000 tons of beet pulp and 499,000
tons of molasses, according to the union. Pulp was supplied to
17 countries, led by the Netherlands,  Latvia , Turkey, Morocco
and Italy. Molasses was sent to 14 nations, with  Turkey ,
Vietnam, Ukraine and Germany the main buyers, the union said.  Pulp and molasses exports may reach 1.5 million tons for
the full year, according to the union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
