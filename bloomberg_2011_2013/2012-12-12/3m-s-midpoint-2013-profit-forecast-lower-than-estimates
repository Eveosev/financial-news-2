3M Co. (MMM) , the manufacturer of products
including Ace bandages and dental braces, expects to make fewer
and larger acquisitions in 2013 as the pipeline for targets is
now stronger than in the past years.  Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin, who took over in
February, reiterated today that the company plans spend $1
billion to $2 billion on purchases next year. 3M also gave a
2013 earnings-per-share forecast range with a midpoint that
missed the average analysts’ estimate by 1.5 cents.  3M, facing a recession in  Europe  and slowing growth in
 Asia , also reaffirmed its 2012 earnings forecast, lowered in
October because of what it called the “current economic
realities.” The company spent  $900 million  on its three most
recent deals, including about $670 million net of cash on
Ceradyne Inc., a maker of ceramics used in energy, aerospace and
defense industries.  “You should see as we move ahead slightly bigger than you
have seen in the past -- and fewer --  and they will be more
strategically linked to our prioritization,” Thulin said of
possible deals on a conference call with analysts.  3M fell 0.6 percent to $93.12 at the close in  New York . The
 shares  have climbed 14 percent this year.  Earnings will rise to $6.70 to $6.95 a share next year,  St.
Paul , Minnesota-based 3M said in a statement. That compares with
$6.84, the  average  of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The $6.825 midpoint represents an 8.2 percent increase over
the 2012 forecast midpoint, which in turn is 5.9 percent higher
than in 2011. In October, 3M lowered its 2012 earnings estimate
to $6.27 to $6.35 a share.  3M expects sales from existing businesses to rise 2 percent
to 5 percent next year, according to the statement. Most of the
growth will come from developing markets, which will see gains
of 5 percent to 10 percent, the company said.  The manufacturer plans capital expenditures of as much as
$1.8 billion next year. Dividend payments will range from $1.65
billion to $1.75 billion and gross share repurchases will be as
much as $3 billion, 3M said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
