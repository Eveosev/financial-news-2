Poland ’s lower house of parliament
approved the government’s 2013 budget, which foresees a deficit
of 35.6 billion zloty ($11.3 billion).  The budget includes revenue of 299.4 billion zloty and
spending of 335 billion zloty. The 2012 deficit is planned at 35
billion zloty. The upper house Senate must also pass the bill
before President Bronislaw Komorowski signs it into law.  While the budget forecasts economic growth of 2.2 percent
next year, the government lowered its prediction to 2 percent
after sending the draft to parliament, Deputy Finance Minister
Wojciech Kowalczyk said in interview on Dec. 6.  Poland is seeking to raise 5 billion zloty from asset sales
next year to help finance the deficit. Among the biggest
offerings will be power utility Energa SA, insurer  PZU SA (PZU) ,  PKO
Bank Polski (PKO)  SA and property holding company Grupa PHN SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
