China allocated a total of 13
billion  yuan  ($2 billion) this year from central government
funds for domestic solar installations, Xinhua  News Agency 
reported.  The funds will be spent on solar power demonstration
projects with 5.2 gigawatts of capacity, Xinhua said, citing an
unidentified official from the  Ministry of Finance . China will
provide an incentive of 5.5 yuan a watt for projects whose
developers will consume the power for their own use.  The subsidies will be raised to 18 yuan a watt for
residential systems and 25 yuan a watt for independent
photovoltaic  power plants , the government-owned news agency
said.  China started offering the subsidies since 2009 to bolster
the use of solar power. The nation chose 4.5 gigawatts of solar
projects eligible for subsidies under the so-called Golden Sun
program this year.  The government will focus on selecting large-scale projects
and big companies for demonstration, Xinhua reported. Two phone
calls to the ministryâ€™s Beijing-based press office went
unanswered.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
