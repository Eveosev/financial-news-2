Pope Benedict XVI  blessed hundreds
of thousands of followers today in his first Twitter message
after joining the social network earlier this month.  “Dear friends, I am pleased to get in touch with you
through Twitter,” read the tweet, sent at the end of the
Pontiff’s weekly general audience. “Thank you for your generous
response. I bless all of you from my heart,” the 85-year-old
pope wrote.  The English version of his account @Pontifex, Latin for
Pontiff, had more than 750,000 followers as of 1:26 p.m. in
 Rome , Benedict’s official Twitter page  showed . The first papal
tweet was also sent through his Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,
German, Polish and Arabic accounts.  This is not the first time Benedict has reached out to
cyberspace in an effort to attract young people to the Church.  Last year the Pope used an  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPad to send his
first post on Twitter through a non-personal Vatican account.  To contact the reporter on this story:
