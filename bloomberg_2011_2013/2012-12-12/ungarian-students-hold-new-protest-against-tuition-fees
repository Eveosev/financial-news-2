Hungarian university students
continued protests against government plans to introduce tuition
fees and cut state-subsidized places at colleges.  About 1,000 students packed the main hall of Technical
University in Budapest, demanding Prime Minister  Viktor Orban 
explain his reversal after previously opposing tuition fees,
according to webcasts by Index news website today.  Orban, who as opposition leader organized a successful
referendum in 2008 to cancel tuition fees, now plans to cut
funding to public universities. He is under pressure to cut
spending and keep the  budget deficit  within 3 percent of
economic output to avert losing European Union funding.  The Cabinet has confirmed media reports that it wants to
cut state-subsidized places at universities to 10,480 next year
from 27,250. Students want the government to scrap its plan and
are concerned that the new rules are discriminatory against
poorer students, said David Kis, a representative of a student
union, according to Index.  The economy is in its second recession in four years and
the government has relied on extraordinary company taxes and
spending cuts to plug budget holes as investments dropped.  The government needs to end discriminatory, opaque and
unpredictable policies, which are contributing record-low
investments and a lack of growth, one of the biggest company
lobby groups, the Joint Venture Association, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
