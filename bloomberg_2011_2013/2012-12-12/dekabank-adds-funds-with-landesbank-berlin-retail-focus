Dekabank, the asset manager for
 Germany ’s savings banks, will acquire  Landesbank Berlin  Holding
AG’s fund business as the lender focuses on  consumer banking  in
the country’s capital to cut costs.  Landesbank Berlin, which is owned by the savings banks,
will transfer its capital-markets business and the fund arm of
its LBB Invest unit to Frankfurt-based Dekabank, the DSGV
savings banks association said today in a  statement .  The move will help cut administrative costs by eliminating
Landesbank Berlin’s structure and overlap in the capital-markets
and asset-management businesses, DSGV said on its website. The
group said it expects to see “first signs” of the changes in
2013.  Landesbank Berlin will concentrate on retail clients and
commercial real estate financing in the region, while its Berlin
Hyp unit will be made independent and continue its real estate
financing outside of the the city, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
