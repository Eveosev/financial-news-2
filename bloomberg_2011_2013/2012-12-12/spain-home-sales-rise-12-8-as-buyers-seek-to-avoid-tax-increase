Spanish home  sales  rose 12.8 percent
in October from a year earlier as buyers sought to take
advantage of a lower  tax rate  and a rebate on home purchases
before they’re phased out at the end of the year.  Existing home sales rose 11.1 percent and new home sales
increased 14.7 percent from the same month last year, the
 National Statistics Institute  in Madrid said today on its
website. It’s the biggest year-on-year gain since January 2011,
according to the data.  “The end of tax breaks for home buyers has acted as an
impulse for the market towards the end of the year,” said
 Fernando Encinar , co-founder of  Idealista.com,  Spain ’s largest
real estate website. “This small rally is a one off and not a
sign of recovery in a sector which still needs to see price
declines to get home sales really moving.”  Spain has an excess of around 700,000 homes, according to
the Ministry of Public Works. The figure is estimated to be more
like two million units if unfinished homes, foreclosed
properties and those still held by developers are included,
according to real estate consulting firm Acuna & Asociados.  To clear the glut and spur demand, the government said in
July it will scrap a tax rebate and raise value-added tax on new
home purchases to 10 percent from four percent as of January
2013 to encourage buyers to lock in the existing breaks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
