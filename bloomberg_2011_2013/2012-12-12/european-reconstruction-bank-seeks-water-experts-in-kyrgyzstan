The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development is seeking project managers and water experts in
the central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan to improve supplies so
unreliable there may not be potable water for more than a couple
hours every other day.  The EBRD started water and wastewater infrastructure
upgrades in 2009 with a project in the Kyrgyz capital of
Bishkek, signed three other pacts and said it’s now  soliciting 
experts for work in Kant, which has a sugar factory and hosts a
Russian air base, a second in nearby Bishkek and Talas starting
in early 2013 valued at 580,000 euros ($757,000).  The situation is such that Kyrgyz families store water in
bathtubs and buckets when supply is available and water-borne
disease outbreaks can occur, the bank said, adding that it’s
trying to address the problems through “a number of relatively
small but well-designed projects.”  The U.S. military has an air base in Manas, Kyrgyzstan,
that’s used to supply troops to  Afghanistan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
