Crude options volatility fell as
futures rose after the Federal Reserve boosted stimulus measures
and the International Energy Agency forecast higher demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 26.39 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange as of 2:35 p.m., down from 27.5 percent
yesterday.  February-delivery crude oil advanced 99 cents to settle at
$87.31 a barrel on the Nymex.  Futures rose as the Fed said it will buy $45 billion a
month of Treasury securities starting in January, and the IEA
increased its world oil-demand forecast for this quarter and
next year.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $85 puts, which slipped 38 cents to 21 cents a barrel on
volume of 4,058 lots at 2:41 p.m. February $75 puts were the
second-most active, with 3,016 lots exchanged as they declined 6
cents to 27 cents.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 60
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish and bearish bets were
almost evenly split amid the 101,689 contracts traded.  February $110 calls were the most active options yesterday
with 5,742 contracts changing hands. They were unchanged at 7
cents a barrel. February $72 puts fell 2 cents to 17 cents on
4,244 lots.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
45,794 contracts. Next were January $60 puts at 34,922 lots, and
January $110 calls with 31,399.  To contact the reporter on this story:
