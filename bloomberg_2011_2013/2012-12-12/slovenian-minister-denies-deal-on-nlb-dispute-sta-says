Slovenia and  Croatia  haven’t reached
a deal on the dispute over Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., STA
newswire  reported  citing Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec.  Croatia’s Jutarnji List reported today that experts from
the two former Yugoslav republics, France Arhar and Zdravko Rogic, proposed a solution to the feud under which Slovenia
would return to Croatia 278.7 million euros ($363 million) over
the next 30 years, while Croatia will not seek  interest rates 
dating from the early 1990s.  “This is just a media spin,” Erjavec was quoted as saying
by the Slovenian newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
