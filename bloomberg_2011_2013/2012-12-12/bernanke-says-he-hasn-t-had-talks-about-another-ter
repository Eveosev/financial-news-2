Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he hasn’t had discussions with the Obama
administration about keeping his job as central bank chief after
his second term ends Jan. 31, 2014.  “I haven’t had any conversations,” Bernanke, 58, said in
response to a question at a press conference today at  the Fed  in
Washington. “I think the president has got quite a few issues
he needs to be thinking about, from the fiscal cliff to many
other appointments and so on.”  Bernanke took over as Fed chief in 2006 after being
appointed by Republican President  George W. Bush  and started a
second term in 2010 after being re-appointed by President  Barack Obama , a Democrat. Bernanke also was a Fed Board governor from
2002 to 2005, when he left to serve as chairman of President
Bush’s  Council of Economic Advisers . His current term as a
governor on the seven-member panel ends in Jan. 31, 2020.  “I’m very much engaged in the difficult issues that we’re
discussing,” Bernanke said today. “I have not been spending
time thinking about my own future.”  Bernanke also said today that he didn’t have anything to
add to comments at his last press conference on Sept. 13, when
he was asked if he would serve a third term if asked.  “I have a lot to do,” Bernanke said Sept. 13. “I’m very
focused on my work, and I don’t have any decision or any
information to give you on my personal plans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
