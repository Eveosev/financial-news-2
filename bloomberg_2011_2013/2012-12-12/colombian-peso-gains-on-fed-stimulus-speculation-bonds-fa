Colombia ’s peso advanced, nearing a
two-month high, amid speculation the dollar may weaken after the
U.S. Federal Reserve said it will buy $45 billion a month in
 Treasury securities  to help boost economic growth.  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 1,794.82 per  U.S. dollar ,
extending gains this year to 8 percent. It touched 1,793.6 on
Dec. 10, the lowest intraday level since Oct. 8.  “More liquidity translates into increased appreciation
pressures on the peso,” said Daniel Lozano, head analyst at
Serfinco brokerage in Bogota. “The trend is for the peso to
continue to strengthen.”  The Fed’s buying plan will be in addition to $40 billion a
month of mortgage-debt purchases. Asset buying will continue
“if the outlook for the labor market does not improve
substantially,” the  Federal Open Market Committee  said today at
the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Washington.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent debt due in July 2024
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.01 percent,
according to the country’s central bank. The bond’s price rose
0.054 centavo to 132.622 centavos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
