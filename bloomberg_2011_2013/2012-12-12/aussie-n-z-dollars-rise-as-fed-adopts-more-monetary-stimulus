The Australian and New Zealand
dollars rose against their U.S. peer after the Federal Reserve
added to its monetary-stimulus program, renewing concern the
measures will debase the U.S. currency.  Australia’s dollar strengthened to almost a three-month
high versus the greenback after the U.S. central bank said it
will buy an additional $45 billion of Treasuries a month. The
New Zealand dollar traded at its highest level in more than four
years versus the yen as the country’s  Liberal Democratic Party ,
which has pledged fiscal stimulus, leads in polls before Dec. 16
elections. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens 
delivered a speech in Bangkok yesterday.  Stevens’ comments suggest that “Asian economic rebalancing
hints at an outlook that is supportive of commodity demand, and
thus the Australian dollar,” Eric Theoret, a currency
strategist in Toronto at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ’s Scotia Capital
unit, wrote yesterday in a note to clients.  Australia’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.0555
yesterday in New York, after rising to $1.0586, its highest
level since Sept. 14. It rose 1.2 percent to 87.88 yen.  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, increased 0.5
percent to 84.36 U.S. cents. The kiwi climbed 1.4 percent to
70.24 yen, its highest level since October 2008.  The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (MXAP)  rose 0.5 percent. The Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials rose 0.8 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 6.3 percent this
year, the biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation
currencies monitored by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The Aussie has gained 0.7 percent, and the  U.S. dollar 
has fallen 2.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
