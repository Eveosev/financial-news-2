The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell to the lowest in more than two months,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars was 22 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:30 a.m., from
minus 23 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure is the lowest since Oct. 5.  The one-year basis swap was 24 basis points below Euribor
from minus 26. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another was little changed with the difference
between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-
OIS spread, at 12.6.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at a
record-low 0.067 percent yesterday from 0.069 percent the day
before. The Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, rose to a five-day
high of 4.9 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday to 237 billion euros ($308 billion) from
229 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
