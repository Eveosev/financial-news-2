Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX) ’s Medicis unit, which makes drugs to treat
skin conditions, sued  Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ANAC)  alleging
violation of a collaborative research agreement.  Medicis wants a judge to force Anacor to comply with its
contract and to issue “a permanent injunction against an
improper arbitration,” according to papers filed in Delaware
Chancery Court in Wilmington yesterday.  The complaint was filed under seal, with additional public
information in other documents. Terms of the agreement weren’t
specified. Palo Alto, California-based Anacor said in an Oct. 5
statement that it had a research-and-development agreement with
Medicis to help discover small-molecule compounds to treat acne.  An Anacor spokeswoman, DeDe Sheel, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the dispute.  Valeant is based in  Montreal , and Medicis is based in
Scottsdale, Arizona.  The case is Medicis v. Anacor, CA8095, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
