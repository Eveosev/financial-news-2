Indian consumer prices rose at the
fastest pace in three months in November as costs of sugar and
vegetables increased.  The  consumer-price index  climbed 9.9 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a 9.75 percent advance reported earlier
for October, the Statistics Office said in a statement in  New
Delhi  today.  India’s consumer inflation is the fastest among 17
economies in the Asia-Pacific region tracked by Bloomberg.
 Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao held interest
rates in October, and said last week that while price gains
remain high, he expects they will ease in the January-March
quarter.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government last week won
parliamentary endorsement for its decision to allow foreign
direct investment in supermarkets, a move it says can help lower
food costs. The central bank meets next week to determine policy.  Vegetable prices climbed 14.74 percent last month from a
year earlier, today’s statement showed, while sugar rose 17
percent and pulses gained 14.19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
