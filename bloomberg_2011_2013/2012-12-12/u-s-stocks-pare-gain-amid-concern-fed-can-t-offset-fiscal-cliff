U.S. stocks trimmed gains as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank can’t
offset the full effect of the fiscal cliff, damping optimism
about the Fed’s plan to buy more Treasuries.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.2 percent to
1,430.46 at 3:24 p.m. in New York after earlier climbing as much
as 0.8 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
