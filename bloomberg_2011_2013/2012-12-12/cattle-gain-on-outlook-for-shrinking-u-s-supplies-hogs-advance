Cattle futures advanced for a second
day on speculation that U.S. beef supplies are tightening as the
feedlot herd shrinks. Hog prices rose.  Wholesale  beef  rose to $1.9617 a pound yesterday, a 1.1
percent gain that was the biggest since Oct. 15, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. Feedlots have reduced the number of
cattle offered for slaughter, said  Lane Broadbent , a vice
president at KIS Futures in Oklahoma City. Meatpackers processed
249,000 head in the first two days of this week, down 1.6
percent from a year earlier, USDA data show.  “Their showlist size is going to be tighter, especially if
we have any kind of demand in here,” Broadbent said in a
telephone interview.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $1.31975 a pound at 10:11 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, after gaining as much as 0.3 percent.
Through yesterday, the commodity is up 8.6 percent this year as
the U.S. herd shrunk.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement climbed 0.5
percent to $1.529 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for February settlement advanced 0.1 percent to
84.2 cents a pound in  Chicago . Prices fell 0.2 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
