The U.S. projected the Mississippi
River near St. Louis will drop to a depth of about 9 feet on
Dec. 26, pushing back the date when barge traffic could be
impeded.  Water levels will fall below 9 feet after Dec. 26, absent
precipitation, the National Weather Service said today in its
four-week forecast. Thatâ€™s two weeks later than forecast last
week.  Barge traffic may be halted if the water level is lower
than 9 feet, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
