An Epoch Holding Corp. shareholder
sued to block  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s $668 million acquisition
of the investment advisory company, claiming the proposed deal
hurts Epoch investors.  The all-cash offer deprives Epoch shareholders of all
future dividends and future growth in the combined entity,
lawyers for the shareholder, the Cindy Goldman TTEE GSS 508
Trust, said in a complaint filed yesterday in New York State
 Supreme Court  in  Manhattan .  The acquisition “is opportunistic and provides no
meaningful premium to Epoch’s public shareholders,” according
to the complaint. The trust is seeking to sue on behalf of all
Epoch  shareholders  and to obtain a court order barring the
transaction.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, announced Dec. 6,
Epoch shareholders will receive $28 a share in cash, about 28
percent more than the company’s closing price on Dec. 5. Epoch
will continue to operate under its current brand name and
operating structure, the company said in a statement announcing
the transaction.  Epoch Chief Financial Officer Adam Borak didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment on the complaint.  The case is Cindy Goldman TTEE GSS 508 Trust Dated May 16,
2008 v.  Epoch Holding Corp. (EPHC) , 654341/2012, Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
