Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  cleared the way for more share repurchases, signaling that
the billionaire chairman views the stock as undervalued.  Berkshire will buy back stock for as much as 120 percent of
book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, the Omaha,
Nebraska-based company said today in a statement. The old limit
was 110 percent.  Buffett, 82, began a buyback program in 2011 after shunning
repurchases for four decades. Opportunities to acquire shares
were limited since that announcement because of the 110 percent
threshold, and the company hadn’t bought back stock this year
through Sept. 30 after buying less than $100 million in 2011.  “They’re, in a nutshell, getting real” after last year’s
more modest authorization, said  Jeff Matthews , author of
“Warren Buffett’s Successor: Who It Is And Why It Matters” and
a Berkshire shareholder. “It’s fine to say we’ll buy a stock at
a price that no one wants to sell it at. But what’s the point?”  Book value was $111,718 a share as of Sept. 30, the company
said in a statement on Nov. 2. Based on that figure, Berkshire
could pay as much as about $134,062. The stock climbed 2.4
percent to $134,000 at 4:15 p.m. in New York and has advanced 17
percent this year.  “The more generous repurchase rules should raise the
shares’ floor valuation,” said  Meyer Shields , an analyst at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co., in a note to investors today.  When the board lifted the limit to 120 percent, Berkshire
repurchased 9,200 Class A shares for $131,000 each from the
estate of a long-time shareholder, who wasn’t identified in the
statement. Buffett didn’t return a message left with an
assistant seeking comment. The cost is $1.2 billion, or about
one month of  earnings . The company has a market value of about
$220 billion.  ‘Ample Funds’  Berkshire’s  cash hoard  surged 17 percent to $47.8 billion
in the three months ended Sept. 30. That’s $115 million less
than the record at the end of June 2011.  Buffett has been searching for larger  acquisitions  to use
some of those funds. He passed on a deal valued at about $22
billion because he couldn’t agree on price, he said in May.  The billionaire has said he and Vice Chairman Charles Munger, 88, favor buybacks when two conditions are met.  “First, a company has ample funds to take care of the
operational and liquidity needs,” Buffett wrote in his most
recent annual  letter  to shareholders. “Second, its stock is
selling at a material discount to the company’s intrinsic
business value, conservatively calculated.”  ‘Mixed Emotions’  Berkshire may buy back 5,000 shares a quarter, Shields
said. He raised his estimate of  adjusted earnings  per share to
$8,521 for next year, from a prior projection of $8,439.  “We don’t expect a flood of long-term shareholders selling
their shares by year-end 2012 to avoid possibly higher capital
gains taxes,” he wrote.  Long-term capital gains taxes will rise Jan. 1 for top
earners by 3.8 percentage-points to help fund President  Barack Obama ’s overhaul of U.S. health care. Obama, 51, has proposed
raising the rate another 5 percentage points, to 23.8 percent.  Buffett has said he and Munger have “mixed emotions”
purchasing stock from long-term shareholders at a price that he
believes is below intrinsic value. Buffett calls such investors
“partners.”  “We don’t enjoy cashing out partners at a discount, even
though our doing so may give the selling shareholders a slightly
higher price than they would receive if our bid was absent,” he
wrote in the letter. “When we are buying, therefore, we want
those exiting partners to be fully informed about the value of
the assets they are selling.”  Berkshire shares traded at an average price of about
$130,000 from the end of October through yesterday. The stock
reached almost $133,000 on Nov. 27. Berkshire didn’t specify the
date it bought stock from the estate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
