Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s security team helped
name people around the globe suspected of being involved in
Internet crime rings that stole identities and defrauded victims
of more than $850 million, the FBI said.  The  U.S. Department of Justice , the  Federal Bureau  of
Investigation and international law enforcement agencies
arrested 10 people from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia,
Macedonia, New Zealand, Peru, the U.K. and the U.S., who are
suspected of being members of the crime rings, the FBI said in a
 statement  on its website. Numerous search warrants have also
been issued, it said.  The crime rings are linked to variants of the Yahos
malicious software, which used a so-called Butterfly Botnet to
steal computer users’ credit card, bank account and other
personal information, according to the FBI. More than 11 million
computer systems were compromised, the agency said.  Facebook helped in identifying the perpetrators and those
affected by the malware, the FBI said. Yahos targeted Facebook
users from 2010 until October this year, according to the FBI.  Menlo Park , California-based Facebook is the owner of the
world’s largest social network with more than 1 billion users.  Reuters reported the FBI investigation earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
