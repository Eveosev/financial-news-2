Renault SA (RNO) , which is losing sales
faster than any other European carmaker, sold its remaining
 Volvo AB (VOLVB)  stake for 12.8 billion kronor ($1.92 billion) to boost
funding, ending an 11-year run as the Swedish truckmaker’s
largest owner.  Renault disposed of a 6.5 percent holding at 92.25 kronor
per share, 3.8 percent below yesterday’s closing price of 95.90
kronor, to reduce debt and invest in France, Russia and China,
the company said in a statement today. Renault sold a 14.9
percent Volvo stake in 2010.  The French carmaker, whose European sales plunged 18
percent through October, is the latest automaker to take steps
to shore up it finances as the region’s market heads for its
biggest drop in 19 years.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  is asking for 7
billion euros in loan guarantees from the French government,
 Ford Motor Co. (F)  is closing three factories,  General Motors Co. (GM)  is
shutting one plant and  Fiat SpA (F)  is eliminating 1,500 jobs.  “It’s really positive for them because they need the cash
to invest in the automotive business and this clearly
distinguishes them from PSA,” said Sascha Gommel, an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt who recommends holding the shares.
“This puts them in a situation to invest in new models, in new
technologies, unlike PSA which is really short with regards to
cash-flow.”  Renault Gains  Renault rose 59 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 40.22 euros in
Paris trading today. The stock has  gained  50 percent this year,
valuing the carmaker at 11.9 billion euros ($15.6 billion).
 Volvo (VOLVA)  A shares dropped 4.15 kronor, or 4.3 percent, to 91.75
kronor in Stockholm. The stock has gained 21 percent in 2012.  “Volvo is a publicly traded company and owners buy and
sell all the time, so we have no comments on this,” said Marten Wikforss, a spokesman for the Gothenburg-based company.  Net financial debt at the Boulogne-Billancourt, France-
based company’s automotive division at the end of June more than
doubled to 818 million euros from 299 million euros a year
earlier.  About 45 percent of the sale proceeds will be invested in
France, the country’s government said in a statement. Renault
and partner  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  yesterday signed the final
agreement to take control of Lada maker OAO AvtoVAZ in Russia
and invest 23 billion rubles ($742 million) in the new venture.  Renault Investments  “These investments are required for the preparation of the
group’s future in order to follow the rejuvenation program of
the range, strengthen the competitiveness of its European plants
and foster the international expansion of Renault,” the company
said in a statement yesterday.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  placed the shares, the U.S. bank
said in a statement.  Industrivaerden AB said today it bought 10 million A
shares, equivalent to 1.2 percent of  voting rights  and 0.5
percent of the share capital.  The Swedish holding company, which has stakes in companies
including  Skanska AB (SKAB) , steel-maker  SSAB AB (SSABA) , Svenska Handelsbanken
AB and  Sandvik AB (SAND) , now owns 6.2 percent of Volvo AB’s share
capital and 18.7 percent of the voting rights, making it the
manufacturer’s largest shareholder.  “It’s important for Volvo to have a strong and stable
owner structure and we believe that after this sale, it will
continue to have such a structure,” Carl-Olof By,
Industrivaerden’s deputy chief executive officer,  said in a
telephone interview. “We believe in the company and see big
potential and will continue to be a long-term owner.”  Renault sold a 14.9 percent stake in Volvo in 2010 for 3
billion euros. The French carmaker acquired its holding in 2001,
when it sold the heavy-truck unit to the Swedish company.  Lowered Forecast  Renault in October lowered its forecast for industrywide
European sales to a decline of at least 8 percent, from a July
estimate of a drop of 6 percent to 7 percent, and said 2012
revenue will be lower than 2011. The French carmaker kept its
target of positive free  cash flow  this year in the auto unit.  Peugeot, Europe’s second-largest carmaker, said two days
ago that it will eliminate an additional 1,500 jobs by 2014,
deepening its  workforce reduction  to 11,200 positions. Peugeot
is also selling a 75 percent stake in its Gefco trucking unit to
OAO Russian Railways for 800 million euros to raise cash.  GM announced this week that it will shutter a factory in
Germany, threatening 3,100 jobs. Ford intends to shut three
European plants, one in Belgium and two in the U.K. Fiat closed
a car plant on the Italian island of Sicily in late 2011. The
 Turin-based manufacturer  said last week that it will cut 1,500
jobs in Poland.  To contact the reporters on this story:
