Dolby Laboratories Inc. (DLB)  closed at
the highest price in almost three months after the sound and
video pioneer announced a special dividend.  The stock  gained  2.4 percent to $35 in New York, for the
highest price since Sept. 19. The San Francisco-based company
has advanced 15 percent this year.  Dolby joins companies from Oracle Corp. to  Dish Network
Corp. (DISH)  awarding special payouts or accelerating dividend payments
ahead of anticipated tax increases next year. Dolby will pay
shareholders $4 a share on Dec. 27 to stockholders of record as
of Dec. 21, according to a statement yesterday.  The company will spend about $408 million on the payout,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
