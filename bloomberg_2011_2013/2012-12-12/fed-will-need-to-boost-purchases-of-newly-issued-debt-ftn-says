The  Federal Reserve  may have to
accelerate purchases of more newly issued Treasuries under its
latest round of quantitative easing as the world’s largest bond
firms’ willingness to sell ebbs, according to FTN Financial.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said today it would buy
$45 billion a month of  U.S. government debt . That’s on top of
the $40 billion in mortgage securities the central bank is
buying each month to keep borrowing rates low.  The latest move will follow the expiration at the end of
this year of Operation Twist, in which the central bank each
month has swapped about $45 billion in short-term Treasuries for
an equal amount of long-term debt. That program kept the total
size of the balance sheet unchanged, while the new purchases
will expand the Fed’s holdings.  “Given the maturity distribution breakdown -- designed to
mimic net duration of” nine years of Twist -- the Fed may have
to buy more current coupons than in Twist,  Jim Vogel , head of
agency-debt research at FTN in Memphis, Tennessee, wrote in a
client note. He wasn’t immediately available to comment.  The 21 primary dealers that are obligated to trade with the
Fed submitted offers equaling $2.73 for each $1 of the
securities bought by the Fed, based on the latest weekly
average. That compares with a weekly average of $2.99 in offers
since the start of Twist, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Fed has pumped more than $2 trillion into the financial
system since its first round of QE in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
