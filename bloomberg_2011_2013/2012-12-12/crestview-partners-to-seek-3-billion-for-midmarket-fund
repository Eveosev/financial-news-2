Crestview Partners, founded by two
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives, plans to seek $3 billion
for midmarket private-equity investments, according to a
document prepared by a placement agent.  Crestview will begin marketing the new fund in 2013,
according to the document. At that target, Crestview Partners
III LP would exceed the $2.4 billion the prior fund gathered in
2007. James David, a spokesman at Kekst & Co., declined to
comment on behalf of Crestview.  The New York-based firm makes investments in financial
services, media and cable, health care and energy, primarily in
the U.S., and says it takes a contrarian approach to deals. It
does distressed-for-control transactions, rescue loans and
financial restructurings.  The firm has seen a few recent exits. Together with
MidOcean Partners, Crestview in June agreed to sell OneLink
Communications, the largest provider of  cable television  and
high-speed data services in Puerto Rico, for $585.3 million.
Crestview in February sold its interest in Insight
Communications Co. to Time Warner Cable Inc.  The predecessor fund, Crestview Partners II LP, was
producing a 15.8 percent net internal rate of return and a 1.3
times multiple as of June 30, according to performance data on
the website of  California Public Employeesâ€™ Retirement System ,
or Calpers.  Tom Murphy  and Barry Volpert, both previously at Goldman
Sachs, founded Crestview in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
