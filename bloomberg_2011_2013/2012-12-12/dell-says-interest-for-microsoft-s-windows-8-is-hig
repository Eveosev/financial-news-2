Dell Inc. Chief Executive Officer
 Michael Dell  says that he’s seeing strong demand for computers
and tablets running Windows 8, the newest version of  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) ’s flagship operating system.  “The interest in Windows 8 is quite high, even among
commercial customers” who tend to be slower to install new
software, he said at the  Dell World  customer conference in
Austin, Texas.  “PCs are still how business gets done,” he said.  Dell is also a few quarters away from being the world’s
biggest server supplier, the company’s founder said.  “We’re only 64,000 servers away from being No. 1 in the
world,” Dell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
