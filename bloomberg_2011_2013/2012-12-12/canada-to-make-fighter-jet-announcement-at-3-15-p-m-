Canada’s defense and public works
ministers will make an announcement about plans to purchase new
fighter jets today at 3:15 p.m. in Ottawa, according to a notice
posted on a government website.  Canada has been studying whether to proceed with an order
for  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 aircraft as opposition parties
question rising costs. Today’s government  notice  referred to the
overall plan to find new aircraft without mentioning the F-35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
