Portugal ’s inflation rate fell for a
third month in November as the country’s recession sapped
household demand.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
climbed 1.9 percent from a year earlier, less than the 2.1
percent increase in October, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said today in an e-mailed statement. Prices
fell 0.4 percent from October.  Using the statistics institute’s own methods, consumer
prices in Portugal rose 1.9 percent in November from a year
earlier and dropped 0.3 percent from October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
