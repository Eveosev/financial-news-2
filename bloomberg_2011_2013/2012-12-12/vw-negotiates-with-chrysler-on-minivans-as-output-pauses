Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s biggest
automaker, is negotiating with Chrysler Group LLC about future
production of its Routan minivan as output of the model stops
for at least five months.  Chrysler, majority owned by  Fiat SpA (F) , hasn’t assembled the
Routan at its factory in Windsor, Ontario,  since July , according
to the company’s  website . Volkswagen and Chrysler plan to review
their agreement in early 2013, said Dino Chiodo, president of
the Canadian Auto Workers Local 444 in Windsor.  Volkswagen agreed with Chrysler, then owned by Daimler AG,
in 2006 to an alliance for minivan production that began two
years later. Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of both
Chrysler and Turin, Italy-based Fiat, has clashed with
Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn this year as  Europe ’s auto
market slumps to a 17-year low.  “There truly hasn’t been a decision one way or the other”
whether production of the Routan will continue in Windsor, Scott Vazin, a Volkswagen spokesman, said in a telephone interview.
Jodi Tinson, a Chrysler spokeswoman, declined to comment.  Chrysler has built 8,662 Routan minivans this year through
November, 38 percent fewer than a year earlier, according to the
Auburn Hills, Michigan-based company’s website.  Production climbed 21 percent to 185,613 for the Dodge
Grand Caravan and 15 percent to 119,530 for the Chrysler Town &
Country and Lancia Grand Voyager, sold in Europe.  Volkswagen’s agreement with Chrysler to build minivans in
Windsor runs through the 2014 model year, Vazin said.  Marchionne’s Evaluation  Marchionne, 60, has said he’s evaluating whether Chrysler
needs both the Town & Country and Grand Caravan and which model
will remain in the market that Chrysler has led since
introducing the first minivan in 1983. The U.S. minivan segment
shrank to 3.7 percent of U.S. light-vehicle sales last year from
7.9 percent in 2000, according to researcher Autodata Corp.  “We have spent an inordinate amount of time looking at
that market,” Marchionne said of minivans during a Nov. 15
press conference at a Chrysler engine plant in  Detroit . “I’ve
run more clinics on models than God knows. We’ve been doing this
now for over a year.”  Town & Country sales climbed 21 percent to 102,486 this
year through November while the Dodge Grand Caravan rose 29
percent to 127,308.  Volkswagen, which has U.S. operations based in Herndon,
 Virginia , sold 9,923 Routans this year through November, a 17
percent decline from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
