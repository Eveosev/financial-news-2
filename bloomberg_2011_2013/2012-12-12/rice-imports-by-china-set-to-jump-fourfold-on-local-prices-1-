Rice purchases by  China , the largest
producer, may soar fourfold this year after a government policy
to support farm incomes drove up domestic prices, the  United
Nations  said.  Shipments may reach 2.3 million metric tons to 2.4 million
tons, said  Concepcion Calpe , a senior economist at the UN’s Food
& Agriculture Organization. That compares with a prediction of 2
million tons last month and 600,000 tons in 2011, according to
the FAO. While there’s no shortage in China, processors
increased imports to profit from the difference between domestic
and overseas rates, said Bai Peipei, an analyst at Beijing
Shennong Kexin Agribusiness Consulting Co.  Rising imports by China may bolster prices even as world
inventories tracked by the FAO swell to a record, boosted by the
biggest global crop ever. While rice, the staple for half the
world, has risen 4.4 percent in  Chicago  this year, it is 16
percent below a three-year high in September 2011. Most
purchases by China, which typically imports from  Thailand , were
of Vietnamese origin this year.  “The year 2012 marks a radical departure from China’s
normal pattern of purchases,” Calpe wrote in an e-mail to
Hiroyuki Konuma, the FAO’s assistant secretary general and
regional representative for Asia and Pacific. “Nobody knows the
actual volume of rice held in stocks by China,” according to
the e-mail, which was forwarded to Bloomberg yesterday.  Export Prices  The price of the Indica variety in Hubei, a Chinese
province with a surplus of the grain, has gained 11 percent to
3,900  yuan  ($625) per ton in the year to September, FAO data
show. That compares with Vietnam’s export rate of $451 a ton for
its 5 percent broken rice, the most-expensive variety from that
nation tracked by the FAO. That variety has fallen further to
$446 a ton in November, the data show. Thailand’s five percent
broken white rice was at $598 a ton, according to the data.  “The government continues to buy from farmers at high
prices to support planting,” said Bai, of Beijing Shennong, a
researcher that advises companies including global trading
houses and government agencies. “Some processors in southern
China have chosen to import rice over using domestic production
because it’s much more profitable.”  The minimum price the government pays farmers for the
Indica paddy advanced 18 percent to 120 yuan per 50 kilogram bag,
the FAO said in its report in November. While that boosted the
nation’s supplies, it also pushed up domestic prices, it said.  Strong Imports  China has purchased 1.43 million tons from Vietnam in the
first 10 months of 2012, taking its total imports from all
suppliers to 2 million tons, Calpe said. The total is four times
the 505,244 tons that China imported in the same 2011 period
from suppliers including  Pakistan ,  Laos , Myanmar and four other
shippers, Chinese customs data tracked by the FAO showed.  The strong pace of purchases by China prompted the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  to raise its  estimate  for the nation’s
imports in 2013 by a third to 2 million tons in November, from
1.5 million tons a month earlier. “As in 2012, China is
expected to be a net importer in 2013,” the USDA Economic
Research Service said in a Nov. 13  report . The USDA maintained
its estimates on China in its latest update released yesterday.  World ending stocks are forecast to climb 6.6 percent to a
record 169.8 million tons in 2012-2013, after three consecutive
record harvests outpacing demand, according to the FAO.  Rough rice for delivery in January was little changed at
$15.525 per 100 pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade at 4:22 p.m.
Singapore time. Futures reached $18.54 on Sept. 12, 2011.  Milled rice  production  in China will climb to a record 143
million tons in the year that began July 1, the USDA said
yesterday, maintaining last month’s estimate. Consumption will
gain 3.2 percent to a record 144 million tons, it said.  Vietnam ’s rice  exports  will advance to an all-time high of
7.5 million tons in 2012, while Thailand’s shipments will slump
39 percent to 6.5 million tons, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
