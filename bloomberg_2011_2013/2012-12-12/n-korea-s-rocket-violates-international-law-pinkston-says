Daniel Pinkston , a senior analyst at
the  International Crisis Group , said North Korea’s rocket
Launch today violated international law. To understand why the
regime launched the rocket, observers should look to North
Korea’s ideology, he said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television.  On the possible motivations for the launch:  “We have to look at the internal motivations in Pyongyang
and that drives most of their decision making.”  “It has military applications and peaceful-use applications
and of course the regime will try to exploit all the propaganda
value.”  “This is just something they wish to acquire, something
they do according to their ideology and I don’t think this is
necessarily driven by the outside consideration.”  “You can use this technology for both military and peaceful
applications.  On breaking international law:  “This launch is in defiance of UN Security Council
resolutions.”  “This violates international law.”  On relations with  China :  “China is unhappy about it. But in the context of things
that  North Korea  could do, in the region, no one has died from
this, there’s no sea battles or movements of military troops and
so forth, although all the military is on alert, but I think
this will pass.”  “They will try hard to dissuade North Korea from doing this
in the future. But I think in the whole context of the types of
things that could happen, some people in Beijing and elsewhere
will breathe a sigh of relief.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
