The ruble gained for a fourth day as
oil, Russia’s biggest revenue earner, advanced and exporters
prepared to pay monthly taxes next week, increasing demand for
the local currency.  The ruble appreciated 0.4 percent against the dollar to
30.5975 by 7 p.m. in Moscow. It gained 0.3 percent versus the
central bank’s target euro-dollar basket at 34.7764 and added
0.1 percent versus the euro at 39.8840.  Brent crude  climbed 1.1 percent to $109.22 a barrel in
 London , increasing for a third day, after the  International
Energy Agency  increased its oil demand forecast for 2013. Oil
and gas account for about 50 percent of government revenue.
Companies are buying the local currency to pay about 360 billion
rubles ($11.7 billion) in levies, including value-added tax next
week, according to OAO Nomos Bank in Moscow.  “Companies began transferring their dollar revenues into
rubles ahead of tax payouts, which is supporting the national
currency,” Alexei Egorov, an analyst with Nomos Bank, said by
e-mail.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.0206 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.1560 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 183, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
EMBI Global Index. An index of five-year government bond yields
rose one basis point to 6.474 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
