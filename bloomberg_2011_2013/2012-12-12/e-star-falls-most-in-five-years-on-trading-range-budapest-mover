E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR) , a Hungarian
energy supplier, fell the most in five years as the Budapest
Stock Exchange expanded the limits of its permissible trading
band after the company filed for bankruptcy.  The shares, which were excluded from the benchmark BUX
 index  as of yesterday,  tumbled  25 percent to 222 forint by the
close in Budapest. The stock has plunged 95 percent this year as
the company failed to redeem bonds that matured in October and
struggled to buy back the securities as well as bonds due 2014
and later.  The bourse allowed the shares to rise or fall by a maximum
of 30 percent, compared with the earlier daily limit of 15
percent on either side, according to a  statement  from the
exchange late yesterday. The company plans to reach an agreement
with its creditors under the bankruptcy procedure to ensure
future operations, E-Star said in a statement last week.  “We expect to see further negative  market sentiment  toward
E-Star,” Peter Szentirmai, a Budapest-based analyst at  KBC
Groep NV (KBC) , wrote in a research report before the open today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
