YPF SA (YPF) ,  Argentina ’s largest energy
company, will bid for any assets that  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) 
wants to sell in Argentina, a YPF official said today.  Petrobras, as the state-controlled company is known,
announced in June it’s seeking to raise as much as $14.8 billion
through asset sales and restructuring to fund deep-water oil
discoveries in  Brazil . The plan includes selling its Argentine
controlled companies, including a 28.5 percent stake in Refinor
SA, Reuters reported Nov. 29.  The YPF official, who can’t be named because of company
policy, said the Buenos Aires-based company would bid given its
importance in the local energy market.  Tarsicio Lima, a Petrobras press official, declined to
comment in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro and in an
e-mail. Alejandro Di Lazzaro, a YPF spokesman, declined to
comment in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
