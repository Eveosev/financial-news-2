(Corrects to say relations between Rousseff and finance
minister in third paragraph.)  Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
is unlikely to fire her finance chief,  Guido Mantega , because
she’s satisfied with his performance and expects economic growth
to accelerate next year, a government official said.  Rousseff has no plans to change the course of economic
policy even after a frustrating third quarter performance in
which growth was below forecast, said the official, who declined
to be named because he’s not authorized to discuss the matter
publicly.  Relations between Rousseff and her finance minister are
strong, said the official.  “I would not think” of resigning, Mantega said to
reporters today in Paris, after being asked about the economy’s
recent performance. The Economist magazine called last week for
Rousseff to fire him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
