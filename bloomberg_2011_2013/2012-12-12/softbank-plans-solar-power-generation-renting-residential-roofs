Softbank Corp. (9984) , Japan’s third
largest mobile-phone carrier, will install solar panels on
rooftops of 1,000 homes across the country to take advantage of
the country’s incentive program for clean energy.  The Tokyo-based company will sell power generated from
solar systems supplied by  Sharp Corp. (6753)  and Suntech Power Japan
Corp. to utilities, Softbank said in a  statement  today.  Softbank will pay about 15 percent of what it earns from
solar power generation to home owners for rooftop space and they
can keep the panels after the contract of 20 years expires,
Fumihide Tomizawa, a Softbank official in charge of the project,
said in a press briefing.  Panels on 1,000 homes would have about 4 megawatts in total
capacity, according to Tomizawa. Softbank will start taking
applications on Dec. 21 from home owners in 31 prefectures.  Japan  started so-called feed-in tariffs in July that
require utilities to pay above-market rates for electricity
produced from renewable energy sources, with added costs passed
on to consumers as a surcharge. The tariff for solar this fiscal
year through March 31 is 42 yen (51 cents) per kilowatt hour for
20 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
