Brazil â€™s swap rates fell for the
first time in four days as comments from President Dilma Rousseff encouraged speculation that policy makers will keep
borrowing costs at record lows through the first half of 2013.  Interest rates are on track to converge with international
levels, Rousseff said in a meeting with business leaders in
Paris, adding that Brazil needs to reduce the cost of capital.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2016 decreased
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.16 percent at
1:29 p.m. in Sao Paulo. The real was little changed at 2.0805
after closing on Dec. 7 at 2.0751, the strongest since Nov. 14.  Swap rates tumbled last week as  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) 
forecast policy makers will resume cutting borrowing costs next
year after a report showed gross domestic product expanded in
the third quarter at half the pace economists forecast.  Policy makers left the target lending rate unchanged at a
record low 7.25 percent last month, following 10 straight
reductions. Traders use  interest-rate swaps  to bet on the
direction of borrowing costs.  Gross domestic product in the largest emerging economy
after  China  grew 0.9 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, the statistics agency reported Nov. 30. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for 1.9 percent
expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
