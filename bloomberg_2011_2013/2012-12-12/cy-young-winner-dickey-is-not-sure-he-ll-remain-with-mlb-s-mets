R.A. Dickey, who won the 2012 Cy
Young Award as the National League’s top pitcher, said he’s not
sure if he will remain with the  New York Mets  or be traded
before next season.  Dickey, 38, reiterated yesterday at a team holiday party at
Citi Field that he would like to remain with the Mets. The
knuckleball pitcher acknowledged that he’s not sure whether that
will happen.  Dickey is under contract with the Mets for 2013 at a $5
million salary and the team is prepared to offer him two more
years for a total of $20 million, ESPN reported, without saying
where it got the information. Dickey is seeking a combined $26
million to $28 million for 2014 and 2015, ESPN said.  “You can’t help but take in that there are teams that are
interested, you know there’s a possibility you could be
traded,” Dickey told reporters yesterday. “We are progressing,
albeit slowly, on an extension. All along, this is the place
that I’ve been and I really feel a connection to this place, but
at the same time you don’t want to be taken advantage of.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
