European Central Bank council member
Jens Weidmann said central banks can lose their inflation-
fighting credibility when they attempt to compensate for
structural weaknesses in the economy.  “The longer a central bank tries to paper over structural
growth weaknesses, the less credible it becomes with regards to
 price stability ,” Weidmann, who heads Germany’s Bundesbank,
said in a speech in Frankfurt today. “This can lead to higher
inflation expectations and eventually to inflation.”  Weidmann was the only Governing Council member to vote
against the ECB’s new government bond-purchase program, saying
it is tantamount to printing money to finance governments and
warning it may fuel inflation. ECB President  Mario Draghi 
announced the plan, dubbed Outright Monetary Transactions, in
September. Investors are now waiting for countries like  Spain  to
seek aid from Europe’s rescue fund and sign up to conditions to
trigger ECB debt-market interventions.  “Solid public finances remain a necessary prerequisite for
stable prices,” Weidmann said. “Therefore, from my point of
view, there’s no other way than strong-willed consolidation.”  High government debt may lead to inflation and also harm
economic growth, he said.  “If government debt gets out of hand, prices will rise,”
Weidmann said. “But even before such a spiral occurs there are
dangers for price stability because of rising government debt.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
