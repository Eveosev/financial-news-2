Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  agreed to buy
 Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI)  units that provide investor and public
relations and multimedia services for $390 million in cash as
the second-largest U.S. equity exchange seeks to diversify.  The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2013 and
the divisions will be integrated into Nasdaq OMX’s Corporate
Solutions business, the New York-based exchange said in a
statement today. The acquisition will probably add to earnings
in the first 12 months, excluding transaction-related costs,
Nasdaq OMX said.  Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld is diversifying
Nasdaq’s business, boosting non-transaction revenue to more than
70 percent of the total. The company this week bought a 25
percent stake in  The Order Machine , a Dutch alternative
securities-trading system focused on stocks and equity
derivatives, and is also setting up a new derivatives trading
market in London.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
 Thomson Reuters  in selling financial and legal information and
trading systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
