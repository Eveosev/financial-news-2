Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
challenger in next year’s German election accused her of slowing
progress on a European banking union and said the finance sector
must take more of the cost of rescuing banks in the debt crisis.  Peer Steinbrueck , the former Social Democratic finance
minister who was officially nominated this week to run for the
chancellery in the September 2013 vote, said Merkel wasn’t
following through on a June European Union summit decision to
eventually allow bailout funds to recapitalize banks directly.  Merkel’s government “is going to come under enormous
pressure” next year, Steinbrueck told reporters today in
Berlin. Other European leaders “are sitting in their capitals
and now realizing that the German government is being very
restrained” about making progress on the banking union.  The German leader told lawmakers in her Christian
Democratic-led bloc yesterday that no conclusive decisions will
be made at this week’s EU summit in Brussels because more work
needs to be done on improving competitiveness and working toward
tighter fiscal controls. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has
said direct bank recapitalization won’t happen before an
oversight mechanism is fully operational.  Steinbrueck also called for a harmonized deposit-insurance
system, a 200 billion-euro ($261 billion) bank-rescue fund paid
for by a bank levy and a debt-redemption fund that would pool
sovereign debt.  Juergen Trittin, a leader of the opposition Green party,
appeared alongside Steinbrueck at the briefing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
