LG Display Co. (034220)  declined in Seoul
trading on speculation  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  may introduce an upgraded
iPhone 5 version earlier than expected, potentially cutting the
South Korean company’s shipments for the existing model.  The world’s second-largest maker of liquid-crystal displays
slipped 4.9 percent to 32,700 won at the close on the Korea
Exchange, its steepest loss since June 4.  “There are ongoing rumors in the market that the upgraded
version of the iPhone 5 device, likely dubbed iPhone 5S, may be
launched as early as the first half of next year, propelling
worries that LG’s total display shipment order for the existing
device may shrink,” Kim Byung Ki, an analyst at Kiwoom
Securities Co., said by phone today. “The stock’s strong
performance also gives investors an excuse to take profits.”  Apple accounts for about  4 percent  of LG Display’s revenue
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Claire Ohm, a Seoul-
based spokeswoman for LG Display, declined to comment.  LG Display shares have  climbed  33 percent this year,
compared with a 8.2 percent gain in the benchmark Kospi index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
