South Korea’s bank lending to
households rose 1.1 trillion won ($1 billion) last month to
461.6 trillion won as the central bank kept borrowing costs low.  Mortgage lending fell 0.2 trillion won to 311.9 trillion
won, the Bank of Korea said in an e-mailed statement today.
Loans to companies gained 2.4 trillion won to 600.8 trillion
won.  The central bank will probably keep  interest rates 
unchanged at 2.75 percent tomorrow after two cuts this year,
according to 14 of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The broadest measure of  money supply , M2, rose 0.2 percent
in October from the previous month after a 0.1 percent gain in
September, according to a separate central bank statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
