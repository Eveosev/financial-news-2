Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards dropped
toward a three-year low after the central bank kept borrowing
costs at a record low and predicted the current-account deficit
will widen. Government bonds advanced.  Bank Indonesia held its reference rate at  5.75 percent  for
a 10th month yesterday, as forecast by all 21 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The nation may see its fourth consecutive
 current-account shortfall  this quarter at 2.3 percent of gross
domestic product, which would be the largest in data going back
to 1997, the central bank said in a statement yesterday. The
authority will remain in the market to guard the rupiah,
Governor Darmin Nasution said Dec. 10.  “Bank Indonesia gave no indication it will tighten its
policy to support the external imbalance,” said Mika Martumpal,
a currency analyst at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “The
rupiah will not move too significantly through the year-end, due
to strong corporate demand for dollars, while the central bank
continues to smooth out volatility.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.7 percent to
9,750 per dollar as of 3:50 p.m. in Jakarta, after reaching
9,757 earlier, near a three-year low of 9,823 touched on Dec.
10, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts to buy or
sell the rupiah in 30 days traded at a 1.1 percent discount to
the spot rate. Non-deliverable forwards are settled in dollars.  In the spot market, the rupiah advanced 0.3 percent to
9,635 per dollar, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. The currency reached 9,733 on Dec. 10, the weakest level
since September 2009. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose 25
basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 5.75 percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent securities maturing
in May 2022 fell four basis points to 5.33 percent, prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
