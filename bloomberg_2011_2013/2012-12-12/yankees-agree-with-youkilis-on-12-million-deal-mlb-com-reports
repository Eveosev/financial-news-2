The New York Yankees and free-agent
third baseman  Kevin Youkilis  have agreed on a one-year contract
worth $12 million,  MLB.com reported , without saying where it got
the information.  Youkilis, 33, would help the Yankees offset the loss of
 Alex Rodriguez , who will miss the start of the 2013 Major League
Baseball season while recovering from hip surgery and may be out
until July.  Youkilis, a three-time All-Star, spent his first eight
seasons with the Boston Red Sox before being traded to the
Chicago White Sox in June. Limited by a back injury, he hit a
combined .235 with 19 home runs and 60 runs batted in for the
Red Sox and White Sox in 2012.  Youkilis, who had a $12.25 million salary last season, has
hit .283 with 148 homers and 610 RBIs in nine major league
seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
