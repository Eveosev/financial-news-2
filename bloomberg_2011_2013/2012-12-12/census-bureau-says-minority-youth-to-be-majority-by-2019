The number of minority children in
the U.S. will overtake the white population under age 18 ahead
of schedule in another sign of America’s changing demographics,
according to  projections  by the U.S. Census Bureau.  The ranks of Hispanic, Asian, black, multiracial and other
minority children will surpass 38.2 million in 2019,
outnumbering the 37.7 million white, non-Hispanic children about
four years earlier than earlier predictions, the bureau said
today.  Hispanics and Asians will remain the nation’s fastest
growing minority groups, doubling by 2060, the Census Bureau
said. Senior citizens -- those 65 years of age and older -- will
outnumber children in 2056 for the first time in U.S. history.  “The greater stagnation and aging of the white
population” is of more significance “as an important component
of our future economy” than the changes to the youth
population, William H. Frey, senior fellow at the Washington-
based Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program, said in
an e-mail.  By 2043, minorities will make up the majority of the  U.S.
population , though whites will still be the largest single
group. Whites also will continue to comprise most of the
nation’s senior citizens. By 2060, the Census Bureau said, 56
percent of the elderly will be white people.  The number of working-age adults between 18 and 64 is
projected to grow by 42 million between 2012 and 2060, as the
U.S. population climbs to 420.3 million, up from the current
314.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
