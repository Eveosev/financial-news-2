OAO  LSR Group (LSRG)  started brick
production at its new 10 billion-ruble ($326 million) plant in
 Russia ’s Leningrad region close to St. Petersburg.  The plant has an annual capacity of 160 million bricks. LSR
also opened concrete plant with a 1.68 million-ton annual
capacity in the same region and a brick plant in the Moscow
region, near Russia’s capital, to produce 70 million bricks per
year and develop its raw-material base.  “LSR will sell bricks from the new plant on the local
market and will consume less than 3 percent of its production
volumes by itself,” Alexander Vakhmistrov, the company’s
general director, said to reporters.  The company is considering setting up the concrete plant
near Ryazan in the the center of Russia’s with a 1.6 million-ton
annual capacity to develop its raw material unit, Vakhmistrov
said. He declined to tell the details because the project is not
finally approved by the company’s management.  Housing construction in  St. Petersburg , Russia’s second-
biggest city, grew 2.9 percent in the first 11 months from a
year earlier to 1.6 million square meters, while total Russia
construction rose 3.8 percent to 40.1 million square meters,
according to Rosstat, Russia’a state statistic service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
