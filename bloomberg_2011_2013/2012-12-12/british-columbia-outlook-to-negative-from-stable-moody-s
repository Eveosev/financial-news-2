British Columbia’s Aaa credit-rating
outlook was reduced to negative from stable by Moody’s Investors
Service, which cited the province’s rising debt burden in a
weakening economy.  The revision affects C$39.8 billion ($40 billion) of
outstanding debt, New York-based Moody’s said in a statement.
Net debt has swelled to C$33.6 billion, or 82 percent of
revenue, at the end of March, from 65 percent of revenues four
year earlier, according to Moody’s.  British Columbia projected on Nov. 28 that its fiscal 2012-
2013  budget deficit  will widen to C$1.47 billion, or C$328
million more than the previous forecast of C$1.14 billion,
reflecting lower property-tax revenue and declining coal prices.  The outlook change reflects “the risks to the province’s
ability to reverse the recent accumulation in debt with the
softened economic outlook, weaker commodity prices and continued
expense pressures,” Jennifer Wong, Moody’s lead analyst for the
province, said in the statement.  British Columbia issued C$500 million of 3.2 percent notes
maturing June 18, 2044 yielding 94.5 basis points more than
federal benchmarks last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
