Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s next
chief executive officer already works at the firm, CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein said.  “There’s a very high likelihood, close to 100 percent,
that the next leader of Goldman Sachs is at Goldman Sachs,”
Blankfein, 58, said today at a conference in  New York  hosted by
the New York Times’s DealBook. The board has responsibility to
choose the CEO, not him, he said.  Blankfein, who became CEO in 2006, has overseen the firm’s
highest profits and biggest losses as a public company. He said
he’s heard that executives typically get a sense of when it’s
time to step down, and that hasn’t happened to him yet.  “I come in every day and I’m happy to be with the people I
work with, it’s exciting,” Blankfein said in an interview
conducted by  Andrew Ross Sorkin , who appears on CNBC as well as
leading the New York Times’s DealBook section. “Would I like it
better if I were at home just watching you on TV all day? I
don’t think I’d like that very much.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
