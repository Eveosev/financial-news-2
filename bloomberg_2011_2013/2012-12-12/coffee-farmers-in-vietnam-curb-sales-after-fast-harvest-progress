Coffee growers in  Vietnam , the
world’s biggest producer of the robusta variety used by  Nestle
SA (NESN)  in instant drinks, are curbing sales to seek higher prices
after making faster progress on harvesting than last year.  Farmers have gathered about 75 percent of the crop, or
about 1.1 million metric tons, and sold 360,000 tons, according
to the medians of seven trader and shipper estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The harvest is set to drop 12 percent to 1.45 million
tons from a record 1.65 million tons last season, the survey
shows. Robusta traded in London may climb 14 percent to $2,150 a
ton by the end of June, a separate survey shows.  Curbs on sales from Vietnam may support prices as global
supplies increase. Farmers worldwide will gather 56 million 60-
kilogram bags of robusta in the 2012-2013 year, up from 53.3
million bags a year earlier, the International Coffee
Organization estimates. Robusta has tumbled 13 percent since the
end of September when harvesting began in Vietnam.  “We don’t see any more panic selling like in the past,”
Alexander Gruber, chief representative in Vietnam of Tong Teik,
a member of RCMA Commodities Asia Group, said at an industry
conference last week. “Today farmers sit there and at least
every day they have 10  traders  or middlemen knocking on their
door asking for coffee.”  Farmers have the financial resources to limit sales and are
waiting for domestic prices to reach 40,000 dong ($1.92) a
kilogram,  Luong Van Tu , chairman of Vietnam Coffee & Cocoa
Association, said in a Dec. 6 interview in Ho Chi Minh City.
Prices are around 38,000 dong to 39,000 dong and sometimes lower,
he said. Farmers have been able to borrow at least 50 million
dong each without collateral since the start of the year because
of government support, he said.  Faster Pace  Harvesting was faster than last year as growers started
picking two weeks earlier and the weather was dry, traders said.
Dak Lak, the main growing region in Vietnam, had almost no rain
and the weather was sunny and “quite” favorable for picking in
the first 10 days of December, the Meteorology and Hydrology
Department said Dec. 11. The area will have similar weather in
the 10 days through Dec. 20, it said.  Four out of five traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
said they were bullish on prices, and forecast futures in  London 
would climb to highs ranging from $1,950 a ton to $3,000 a ton
by the end of June as farmers in Vietnam curb sales and the
world economy recovers. One respondent predicted futures may
drop as low as $1,700.  Robusta is harvested mainly in Asia and parts of  Africa ,
while arabica is grown in Latin America. Robusta for delivery in
January rose 0.4 percent to $1,895 a ton on NYSE Liffe at 5:06
p.m. Singapore time. Arabica for March fell 0.3 percent $1.49 a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Robusta’s  discount  to
arabica has shrunk to 63.04 cents from 145 cents at end-2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
