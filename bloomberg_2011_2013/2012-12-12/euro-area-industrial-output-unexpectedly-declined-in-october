Euro-area industrial production
unexpectedly fell in October as declines in  Germany  and France
offset gains in Spain and Portugal.  Output in the 17-nation euro area dropped 1.4 percent from
September, when it declined 2.3 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had
forecast no change in October, according to the median of 34
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Output fell 3.6 percent
from the year-earlier month.  The  European Central Bank  last week estimated that the
euro-area economy will contract 0.5 percent this year and 0.3
percent in 2013. Manufacturing output shrank for a 16th month in
November, according to  Markit Economics , adding to signs a
recession in the currency bloc may extend into next year as
leaders struggle to tackle the sovereign-debt crisis.  Industrial output in Germany, Europe’s largest economy,
fell 2.4 percent after a 1.6 percent decline in September,
today’s report showed. France reported a 0.6 percent drop, while
Spain and Portugal had increases of 1.2 percent and 4.8 percent,
respectively.  Energy production fell 1.5 percent after a 0.2 percent drop
in September, according to today’s report. Output of
intermediate goods and durable  consumer goods  declined 1.2
percent and 3.8 percent, respectively, while production of non-
durable consumer goods advanced 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
