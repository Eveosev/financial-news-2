German electricity for delivery in
2013 fell to a record as coal prices declined a seventh day and
Credit Suisse reduced forecasts for European power.  German power for 2013 dropped as much as 0.3 percent to
45.52 euros ($59.29) a megawatt-hour. That’s the lowest level
for a year-ahead contract since May 2008, according to broker
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract traded at 45.55 euros a
megawatt-hour at 4:25 p.m. in Berlin.  Thermal coal for delivery next year to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp slid as much as 0.6 percent to $94.25 a metric ton,
in its longest series of decreases since August. It traded at
$94.40 a ton at 3:25 p.m. in  London .  Credit Suisse cut forecasts for European power for 2013 to
2015 by 6 percent to reflect expectations of unchanged power
demand resulting from lower economic growth,  energy efficiency 
and rising consumer bills. Meanwhile, overcapacity is poised to
grow, analysts led by Vincent Gilles said in an e-mailed
research note.  “We expect the market to remain over-supplied for this
decade,” Gilles said in the note.  German baseload electricity for tomorrow fell 2.6 percent
to 66.75 euros a megawatt-hour, broker data on Bloomberg showed.  Output from  wind turbines  in Germany was forecast to rise
to more than 5,000 megawatts tomorrow, according to the website
of Meteologica SA, a Madrid-based weather bureau. Wind
generation was at 1,378 megawatts at 1:45 p.m. in Berlin, less
than a third of the 12-month average of 5,100 megawatts,
according to data from European Energy Exchange AG in Leipzig,
 Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
