The pound was little changed against
the euro and the dollar before a report economists said will
show  jobless claims  increased at a slower pace in November.  Sterling was 0.3 percent from the strongest level in more
than a month against the U.S. currency. Jobless-benefit claims
increased 7,000 from October, when they jumped 10,100, the
 Office for National Statistics  will say today, according to the
median of 25 estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey . The
 unemployment rate , calculated using International Labour
Organization methods, was unchanged at 7.8 percent in the three
months through October, a separate survey shows.  The pound traded at 80.77 pence per euro at 7:57 a.m.
London time, after depreciating 0.3 percent yesterday. Sterling
was at $1.6099. It climbed to $1.6131 on Dec. 4, the highest
since Nov. 2.  The pound has gained 1.3 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 2.3 percent and
the dollar fell 2.6 percent.  Gilts have returned 2.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 4.2 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  earned 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
