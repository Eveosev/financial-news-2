A United Nations court found Zdravko Tolimir, a former Bosnian Serb army general, guilty of genocide
and mass killing in 1995 aimed at eliminating Muslims from parts
of eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The  International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia  sentenced Tolimir, 64, to life in prison for his part
in the attacks and “summary executions” of at least 6,000
“able-bodied Muslim men” in Srebrenica and Zepa, two Muslim-
populated towns in Serb-controlled territory, during Bosnia’s
1992-95 war. It was  Europe ’s biggest single massacre since World
War II.  Tolimir was the “right-hand man” of General Ratko Mladic,
the Bosnian Serb army commander in the conflict, Judge Christoph
Fluegge said as he read the verdict. Mladic is also on trial
before The Hague, Netherlands-based court, for his role in the
conflict that killed more than 100,000 people.  Tolimir was arrested in 2007 by Bosnian Serb authorities
and handed over to the court. The tribunal is also trying
 Radovan Karadzic , the Bosnian Serb civilian leader during the
conflict, which was triggered by  Yugoslavia ’s violent breakup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
