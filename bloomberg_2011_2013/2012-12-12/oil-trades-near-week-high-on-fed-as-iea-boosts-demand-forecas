Oil traded near the highest level in
a week in New York after the  Federal Reserve  announced new
measures to bolster the  U.S. economy  and the  International
Energy Agency  increased its demand forecast.  Futures were little changed after climbing the most in two
weeks yesterday. The Fed plans to buy $45 billion a month in
 Treasury securities  to boost economic growth in the world’s
biggest crude user. The IEA raised oil-consumption estimates for
the fourth quarter and 2013 on signs of a rebound in  China . OPEC
kept its production target unchanged for a second time this year
as members judged prices to be sufficiently high.  “The Fed news is supportive for commodity prices” said
Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.
“It creates a bit of a base for commodities and it means that
the pullback in prices from these levels will be fairly shallow.
Most people have de-risked their China outlook in the past
couple of months.”  Crude for January delivery was at $86.39 a barrel, down 38
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 2:33 p.m. Sydney time. The contract increased 98 cents to
$86.77 yesterday, the highest close since Dec. 5. Prices are
down 12 percent this year.  Brent for January settlement fell 45 cents to $109.05 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract gained 1.4 percent yesterday, the most since Nov. 19.  The European benchmark future was at a premium of $22.57 to
West Texas Intermediate, from $22.73 yesterday, the highest
since Nov. 28.  Stockpiles Gain  The spread increased after the U.S. Energy Department
yesterday reported a surge in stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the delivery point for the WTI contract. Supplies for the week
ending Dec. 7 climbed 1.2 million barrels to 46.8 million, the
highest since June 29.  WTI prices gained yesterday as the dollar declined after
the Fed vowed to keep  interest rates  low at least as long as the
 unemployment rate  remains above 6.5 percent and if inflation
between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than
2.5 percent. This was the first time it has linked the outlook
for its main rate to unemployment and inflation.  The U.S. currency yesterday slipped 0.5 percent against its
European counterpart. A falling dollar and rising euro increase
dollar-denominated oil’s value as an investment alternative.  OPEC Maintains  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
pumps 40 percent of the world’s oil, maintained its official
quota at 30 million barrels a day, a level it now exceeds by
about 1 million barrels a day. It failed to elect a new
secretary-general at a meeting yesterday in Vienna and agreed to
extend the term of Abdalla El-Badri for one more year.  Oil in  New York  has technical support along an upward-
sloping trend line on the daily chart, around $85.80 a barrel
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures
yesterday rebounded from this line, which connects the intraday
lows of June and November. Buy orders tend to be clustered near
chart-support levels.  Global oil consumption in the final three months of 2012
will average 90.5 million barrels a day, about 435,000 barrels,
or 0.5 percent, more than previously forecast, the Paris-based
IEA said in a monthly report yesterday. Demand will expand by
865,000 barrels a day in 2013 to 90.5 million, the IEA said,
adding 110,000 barrels to its previous forecast.  China will consume 9.9 million barrels a day in the fourth
quarter, 115,000 barrels more than projected in last month’s
report, according to the IEA. Consumption is estimated to
average 9.8 million barrels a day in 2013.  U.S. Stockpiles  U.S. crude stockpiles gained  843,000 barrels  last week, the
Energy Department showed yesterday. They were forecast to drop
2.5 million barrels, according to the median estimate of 11
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Stockpiles of  gasoline  grew 5 million barrels to 217.1
million, the most since April 6. They were forecast to increase
2 million barrels, according to the survey.  Distillate fuel 
supplies, including diesel and heating oil, climbed for a second
week by 2.9 million barrels to 118.1 million. They were expected
to increase 1.1 million barrels, the survey reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
