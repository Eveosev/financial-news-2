South African white-corn futures
fell for a fourth day, the longest losing streak since Oct. 30,
as the country’s main growing regions continue to receive good
rains before the planting of next season’s crop.  White corn for delivery in March, the most active contract,
decreased 1.7 percent to 2,371 rand ($274) a metric ton by the
close in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for July delivery
dropped 0.3 percent to 2,219 rand a ton.  Free State province, which produces 40 percent of the
nation’s corn, is cool in the east, otherwise cloudy and warm
with isolated showers and thundershowers, though scattered in
the west, the  South African Weather Service  said on its website.
Rain has fallen in the main growing areas since Dec. 7.  “Prices are down mainly due to the rainfall that the
growing areas have been getting,” Lindy van Blommestein, a
trader at Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from
Johannesburg.  Wheat for March delivery declined 1.6 percent to 3,628 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
