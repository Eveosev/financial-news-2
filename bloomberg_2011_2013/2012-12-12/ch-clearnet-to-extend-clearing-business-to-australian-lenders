LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. said it’s
extending its clearing business for over-the-counter interest-
rate instruments to Australia’s banks, boosting competition in
the South Pacific nation.  LCH.Clearnet, the world’s largest clearinghouse for
 interest-rate swaps , said in an e-mailed statement today that it
will apply for an Australian clearing and settlement facility
license. Four domestic banks have submitted letters of intent to
use the company’s service for clearing interest-rate swaps,
London-based LCH.Clearnet said.  “Our discussions with the Australian regulators continue
to be very positive,” Chief Executive Officer Ian Axe said in
the statement. “We are planning to submit our application in
the first quarter of next year.”   As of end-2011, outstanding derivatives positions in
Australian dollars comprised about $11 trillion of the $650
trillion in OTC derivatives globally, according to a Reserve
Bank of Australia  report  released in October, which cited data
from the Bank of International Settlements.  “We do feel it’s an incredibly important market,” Axe
told reporters in a conference call after the statement’s
release. “There is validity in our positioning there,” given
the size of  Australia ’s “real-money type organizations” and
international businesses, he said.  The company will also be evaluating Asian markets next year
and will be looking to define its strategy for the region,
according to Axe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
