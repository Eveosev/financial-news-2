Pig prices declined this week in
 Spain  and France while bottoming out in  Germany  and the
Netherlands, said industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V.  Hog prices in Spain, the European Union’s second-biggest
producer, fell for an eighth week to 1.74 euros ($2.27) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 1.756 euros the previous week, Damme,
Germany-based ISN wrote in a  report  on its website yesterday. In
Germany, the largest breeder, prices were stable at 1.676 euros.  Pork accounts for about half of meat consumption in the 27-
nation EU. Europeans will probably eat less of the meat this
year and next after prices rose and economies slowed, with per-
capita consumption set to fall to 40.3 kilograms in 2013 from
41.2 kilograms in 2012, the bloc forecast in September.  “The unchanged German benchmark quote on the whole brings
stability to the European price structure,” ISN wrote.
“Nevertheless, many price quotes again show a weak trend.”  French prices dropped for a third week to 1.611 euros a
kilogram from 1.659 euros a week ago. The cost of hogs also fell
in  Denmark  to 1.772 euros a kilogram from 1.798 euros, while
prices in the Netherlands, Belgium and  Austria  were unchanged
after dropping last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
