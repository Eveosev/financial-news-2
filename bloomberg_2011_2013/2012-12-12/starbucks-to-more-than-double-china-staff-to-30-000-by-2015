Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest
coffee-shop chain, will more than double  China  staff to 30,000
by 2015 as part of its expansion in the world’s second-largest
economy.  “The Starbucks business here is in its infancy in terms of
development and growth,”  John Culver , head of Starbucks in
China and Asia Pacific, said in an interview today in the
southern Chinese city of Yunnan. Starbucks currently has 12,000
employees in the country.  The Seattle-based coffee chain is boosting headcount as it
pushes to more than double local stores to 1,500 by 2015. The
Asian nation is set to be its largest market outside the U.S. in
two years as it expands to counter slower economic growth in
developed markets.  In its China expansion, the cappuccino and latte maker will
face pressure from rising costs and wages. The country’s
consumer price index rose 2 percent from a year earlier in
November.  Business in China is “very healthy” and the coffee chain
operator will continue to maintain its margins in the world’s
most populous nation, Culver said.  The company will also focus on growing the number of
wholly-owned stores in the China and Asia Pacific region and
sees new stores being the growth driver next year, Culver said.
They will account for two-thirds of the region’s sales growth,
an increase from less than a third three to five years ago, he
said.  China’s coffee shop market is forecast to surge 55 percent
to 4.5 billion  yuan  ($720 million) in 2015 from 2.9 billion yuan
last year, according to data from research company Euromonitor
International. The company today opened a support center for
local coffee farmers in Yunnan.  China and Asia Pacific  revenues  rose 23 percent in the
fourth quarter to $198 million, Starbucks reported on Nov. 1.
This compares with a 9 percent rise in the company’s sales from
the Americas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
