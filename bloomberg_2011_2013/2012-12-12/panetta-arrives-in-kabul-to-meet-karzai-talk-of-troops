U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
arrived today in Kabul to meet with military commanders as well
as Afghan President  Hamid Karzai  and discuss troop levels beyond
2014.  “I look forward to having a firsthand view, talking to
General Allen, and other commanders,” Panetta told reporters on
the plane accompanying him to Kabul. “This will help me as we
set the groundwork for decisions” to be made by President
Barack Obama, Panetta said.  The Obama administration is weighing the number of U.S.
troops that will remain in Afghanistan when the bulk of the
current 66,000 U.S. and coalition forces depart by the end of
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
