Genuine Bio-Fuel Inc. , a U.S.
biodiesel producer, is building a plant in  Puerto Rico  capable
of producing 12 million gallons (45.4 million liters) of fuel a
year to tap markets in the Caribbean and  South America .  The $1.85 million facility, planned for just outside the
southern city of Ponce, is expected to start full production in
May, Jeff Longo, executive vice president for the Indiantown,
Florida-based company, said today in a telephone interview.  Closely held Genuine Bio-Fuel is already shipping biodiesel
from its only operational plant in  Florida  to companies in the
Caribbean at prices competitive with fossil-fuel imports, he
said. The Puerto Rico project, by being closer to the target
market, will be able to furnish fuel even cheaper.  “Our biodiesel sells for on average between 9 and 13 cents
cheaper a gallon than ultra-low sulfur diesel,” he said.
“We’ve already been approached by a number of electrical
companies.”  The project, which started construction last week, will use
vegetable oils sourced from Puerto Rico and surrounding islands
as feedstock, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
