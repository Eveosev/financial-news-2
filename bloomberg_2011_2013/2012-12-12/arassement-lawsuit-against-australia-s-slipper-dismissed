A sexual harassment lawsuit against
 Peter Slipper , the former speaker of  Australia ’s parliament, was
dismissed today in federal court as a judge ruled the claim was
politically motivated.  James Ashby sued the government and Slipper in April,
claiming he’d been harassed and that his contract as an advisor
had been breached. Ashby also claimed Slipper misused his
expense account, a criminal allegation that was dropped from the
suit and referred to the Australian Federal Police.  Federal Court Justice Steven Rares dismissed the lawsuit,
saying in his  ruling  the proceedings were “an abuse of the
process of the court.”  Slipper resigned from the speaker’s post in October after
 text messages  containing crude comments about women were made
public in court proceedings. The matter has proved a distraction
for Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s minority government, which
has relied on Slipper to boost its numbers in the lower house of
parliament.  The Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public
Prosecutions said today that it is “actively considering” the
allegations Slipper misused his expense account and declined to
comment further. Conviction of a criminal offense, carrying a
jail term of more than a year, would force Slipper to resign his
parliamentary seat.  The case is: James Hunter Ashby v. The Commonwealth of
Australia. NSD580/2012. Federal Court of Australia (Sydney).  To contact the reporter on this story:
