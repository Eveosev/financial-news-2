U.S. nuclear power generation  fell
for the fourth time in five days as reactors in Nebraska and
 Ohio  lowered output.  Production slid 0.6 percent to 89,266 megawatts, or 88
percent of capacity, 5.1 percent lower than a  year earlier ,
according to Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by
Bloomberg. Eleven of 104 U.S. reactors were offline.  Nebraska Public Power District’s Cooper 1, a 830-megawatt
reactor 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of Omaha, cut generation
to 24 percent of capacity from 71 percent yesterday. Production
in the NRC’s  western region  was 17 percent lower than a  year
earlier .  Output at Perry 1,  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE) ’s 1,261-megawatt
reactor 35 miles northeast of  Cleveland , fell to 78 percent of
capacity from 100 percent yesterday, leading Midwestern
generation lower by 2.1 percent from a year ago.  Output in the Southeast rose by 31 megawatts as production
at Summer 1 in  South Carolina  increased to 99 percent of
production. Northeastern generation declined by 23 megawatts as
output fell 11 megawatts at each of  PPL Corp. (PPL) ’s two Susquehanna
reactors 50 miles northwest of Allentown,  Pennsylvania .  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
