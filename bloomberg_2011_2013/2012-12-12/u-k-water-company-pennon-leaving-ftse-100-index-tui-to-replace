Pennon Group Plc (PNN) , the third-largest
publicly traded water utility in the U.K., is leaving the FTSE
100 in a rebalancing of the index and is being replaced by the
leisure travel company  Tui Travel Plc. (TT/)        Pennon, whose shares have fallen 13 percent this year, will
become part of the FTSE 250 Index instead following a quarterly
review, the FTSE group said in a statement. The changes take
effect Dec. 24.  Exeter-based Pennon also owns the waste management company
Viridor and South West Water Ltd., a water and sewer service
provider for Devon, Cornwall and parts of Dorset.  United
Utilities Group Plc (UU/)  is Britainâ€™s biggest publicly traded water
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
