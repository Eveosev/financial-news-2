The U.S. government’s budget  deficit 
widened in November, reflecting a jump in spending that normally
takes place a month later.  The shortfall grew to $172.1 billion from $137.3 billion in
November 2011, the Treasury Department said today in  Washington .
The gap was in line with the $171 billion  median estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. Since Dec. 1 fell on a Saturday,
payments made that day were pushed forward into last month.  President  Barack Obama  and Republican lawmakers are seeking
ways to avoid the more than $600 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1. U.S. House
Speaker  John Boehner  said today that there remained “serious
differences” between the two parties.  “We are likely to have a much better performance on the
deficit this year than we had last year,”  Millan Mulraine , the
director of U.S. rates research and strategy for TD Securities
in  New York , said in a telephone interview before the report.
“Even if we avoid the fiscal cliff, the expenditure cuts and
revenue intake that will replace it will likely lower the
deficit.”  The  shortfall  hit a record of $1.42 trillion in 2009 and
declined to $1.09 trillion in fiscal year 2012. The gap was $120
billion in October, the first month of the government’s fiscal
year.  Today’s report showed revenue increased 6.1 percent in
November to $161.7 billion, compared with $152.4 billion in the
same month a year earlier. Spending jumped 15.2 percent to
$333.8 billion from $289.7 billion, the Treasury said.  CBO Estimate  The nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office  estimated on
Dec. 7 the November deficit would be $172 billion. The
Washington-based agency said November spending increased because
Dec. 1 fell on a weekend, shifting some payments from December
to November. If not for the shift, the November shortfall would
have been $1 billion more than the same month last year, the CBO
said.  Individual income tax receipts for the first two months of
the fiscal year rose to $177.1 billion from $157.4 billion in
the same period last year. Corporate income tax receipts rose to
$4.84 billion from $4.1 billion.  Estimates of the November budget gap in the Bloomberg
survey of 26 economists ranged from $113 billion to $175
billion.  Lowering the  budget deficit  has been the key issue of
political debate since Obama won re-election on Nov. 6.  Boehner, who represents Republicans in the negotiations
with Obama, announced a $2.2 trillion proposal Dec. 3. That
called for $800 billion in new revenue through a rate-lowering,
base-broadening overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Boehner would
reduce entitlement spending by $900 billion and other spending
by $300 billion.  Obama has reduced his demand for tax increases to $1.4
trillion from $1.6 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
