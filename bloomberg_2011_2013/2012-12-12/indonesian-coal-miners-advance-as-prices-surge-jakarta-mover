PT United Tractors,  Indonesia ’s
largest heavy equipment seller, and PT Bumi Resources, the
nation’s biggest thermal-coal exporter, led advances in  coal-
mining companies after the benchmark price for the fuel soared
to a six-month high.  Bumi surged 7 percent to 610 rupiah, the most since Sept.
27, and United Tractors, a unit of PT Astra International,
jumped 9.8 percent to 19,000 rupiah, the steepest gain since
Nov. 19, 2010. The stocks were among the best performers on the
 Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) , which increased 0.5 percent.  Power-station coal price at  Australia ’s Newcastle port, the
benchmark for Asian contracts, rose 4.1 percent to $90.65 a ton
in the week ended Dec. 7, according to IHS McCloskey, a
Petersfield, U.K.-based provider of coal data. The new price is
the highest since June 1, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Indonesia, the largest exporter of thermal coal, raised its
benchmark cost on Dec. 7 for the first time in three months.  “Thermal-coal prices will edge higher from 2012’s lows as
we head into the northern winter,” UBS AG said in a note
yesterday. “We expect prices to lift towards $105 per ton.”  United Tractors was also the second-best performer in the
 MSCI Emerging Market Index (MXEF)  today, with volumes nearly twice the
stock’s three-month daily average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
