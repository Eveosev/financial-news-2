(Corrects amount of severance payment in fourth paragraph
of story published yesterday.)  David Campbell , chief executive
officer of Energy Future Holdings Corp.’s Luminant unit, will
resign at the end of the year.  Campbell, 44, will be replaced by Mac McFarland, who has
been an executive vice president of Energy Future and executive
vice president and chief commercial officer of Luminant since
July 2008, the Dallas-based company said in an regulatory filing
today.  Luminant, which is the biggest generation owner in  Texas ,
has struggled amid a slump in natural gas and power prices.
Energy Future has posted seven consecutive quarterly losses and
its competitive unit, which includes Luminant, will face a
“material restructuring” in the next 12 months, Moody’s
Investors Service said in a research note on Dec. 5.  Campbell joined Energy Future in 2004. As of Dec. 31, 2011,
he was due to receive $250,000 in a payout of deferred shares
upon a voluntary departure, according to a Feb. 21 filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Campbell also
received a $2.5 million retention bonus for staying at the
company through Sept. 30, according to the filing.  Energy Future was sold to a group led by  KKR & Co. (KKR)  and TPG
Capital in 2007 in a $43.2 billion cash transaction in the
largest leverage buyout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
