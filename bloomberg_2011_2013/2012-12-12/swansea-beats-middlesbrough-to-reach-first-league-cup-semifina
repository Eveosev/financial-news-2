Swansea City beat Middlesbrough 1-0
to advance to the semifinals of English soccer’s League Cup for
the first time.  An 81st-minute own goal from Middlesbrough’s Seb Hines sent
Swansea into the third elite cup competition semifinal in the
club’s 100-year history. The Welsh team also reached the final
four of the F.A. Cup in 1926 and 1964.  The Swans join Aston Villa and fourth-tier Bradford City in
the semifinal draw on Dec. 19, when Chelsea visits Leeds United
in the remaining quarterfinal. The final is Feb. 24, 2013, at
Wembley stadium in  London .  Bradford upset Arsenal 3-2 in a penalty shootout yesterday
after the teams tied 1-1 after extra time, while Villa won 4-1
at Premier League rival Norwich.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
