An Egyptian blogger was sentenced to
three years in jail for insulting religion.  Albert Sabir, 25, was accused of posting videos on his
Facebook page questioning Islam, Christianity and other
religions, Ahmed Ezzat, a human-rights lawyer who’s following
his case, said by phone today. He said they would appeal the
verdict.  Sabir, a Coptic Egyptian, was detained on Sept. 13. after
posting a video of himself titled “Who is the spokesman for
Allah?” in which he argued that every faith claims sole
ownership of the truth.  Egypt ’s draft constitution, set for Dec. 15, has sparked a
wave of criticism from activists and human rights groups,
arguing the charter falls short for protecting freedoms and
human rights. Article 44 in the draft prohibits insulting any
prophet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
