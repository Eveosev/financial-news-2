Renaissance Capital , the Russian
investment bank controlled by billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ,
hired Otkritie Capital’s head of equities, Ruslan Babaev, and
sales director Maxim Orlovsky.  Otkritie and RenCap agreed to a one-year hiring
“moratorium” after the latest two appointments, said Alexey Karakhan, an Otkritie spokesman, who confirmed Babaev and
Orlovsky had left. Babaev said he and Orlovsky had joined
Otkritie, in a telephone interview.  RenCap last week rehired Igor Vayn from Otkritie as co-
chief executive officer with John Hyman. At least a dozen
bankers joined Otkritie from RenCap when Vayn quit as head of
equities two years ago. Vayn is sharing the top job with Hyman
after Prokhorov took control of the business from founder and
controlling shareholder  Stephen Jennings  last month.  “Igor has an agreement that he can hire two people from
Otkritie, including Ruslan,” Karakhan said by telephone. “Then
there will be a moratorium on hiring for one year from
Otkritie.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
