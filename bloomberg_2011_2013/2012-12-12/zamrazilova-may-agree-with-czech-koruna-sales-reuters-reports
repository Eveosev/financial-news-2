Czech central bank board member  Eva
Zamrazilova  may agree with koruna interventions if the benefits
of a weaker currency for exporters outweigh the impact on
inflation,  Reuters  reported, citing an interview.  Zamrazilova, who voted against all three Czech rate cuts
this year, said there is a risk that weakening the koruna may
increase prices of food and energy so much that it would further
constrain domestic demand, the newswire reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
