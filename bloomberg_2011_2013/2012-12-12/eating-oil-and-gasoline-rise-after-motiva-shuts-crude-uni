Heating oil and gasoline rose after
a crude unit was shut at the largest refinery in the U.S.
following a fire.  Heating oil jumped as much as 2.5 percent after Motiva
Enterprises LLC was said to idle the new 325,000-barrel-a-day
crude unit at its Port Arthur, Texas, plant. The unit, which was
running at about 240,000 barrels a day after resuming operation
this month, shut down following a fire, a person familiar with
the situation said.  “Since it was a game-changer when it restarted it will be
a game changer when it shuts again,” said  Andrew Lebow , a
senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York . “We
had all factored in higher production of distillate and
gasoline.”  Heating oil for January delivery advanced 6.99 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $2.9969 a gallon at 10:10 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Gasoline for January delivery advanced 5.11
cents, or 2 percent, to $2.6616 a gallon.  The average nationwide cost for  regular gasoline  fell 1.3
cents to a $3.315 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.
That’s the lowest level since Jan. 2.  The January heating oil crack spread jumped $1.82 to $38.96
a barrel, and the gasoline spread increased $1 to $24.85.  “It should be bullish for the crack spreads,” Lebow said.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington . The report will
probably say that gasoline stockpiles rose 2 million barrels and
distillate supplies were up by 1.1 million barrels, according to
the median estimate of 11 analysts in Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
