Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the
truckmaker trying to end losses, rose to its highest price in
more than two months after an employee of investor  Carl Icahn 
was named to the company’s board.  The shares gained 4 percent to $22.37 in New York, the
highest closing price since Oct. 11. Navistar has slid 41
percent this year.  Samuel Merksamer, managing director at Icahn Capital LP,
was named to the board, replacing Diane Gulyas, who retired
after serving three years as a director, according to a
statement. Merksamer is the third appointment that’s part of an
October agreement between Lisle, Illinois-based Navistar and
investors Icahn and  Mark Rachesky  to avert a proxy fight.  Navistar generated a $241 million net loss in the first
nine months of its fiscal year. The truckmaker ousted Dan Ustian
as chief executive officer in August after an inquiry from
regulators about its accounting and disclosures, and the company
reversed course on an engine strategy that had failed to meet
2010 federal emission standards. Navistar said Oct. 30 it plans
to close a Texas plant.  Merksamer’s appointment, and Gulyas’s departure, were
effective Dec. 10, according to today’s statement. The other
 board  appointments under the October agreement were Rachesky and
Vincent Intrieri, an Icahn representative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
