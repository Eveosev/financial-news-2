Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  posted
an open letter in Hong Kong’s major newspapers today, calling on
union members to put public interests first and return to the
negotiation table.  The flight attendants’ union, which represents more than
5,800 cabin crew, hasn’t responded to Cathay’s request for
talks, according to a letter published on Oriental Daily News.  Members of the union on Dec. 10 authorized its leaders to
initiate industrial action after a disagreement over a proposed
pay rise for next year. Flight attendants may work-to-rule or
refuse to do tasks such as serving food in the days leading to
Christmas, Dora Lai, the union’s chairwoman said.  The labor group had asked for a 5 percent pay rise, while
Cathay only agreed to an increase of about 2 percent. Cathay
said in its the open letter that employees have seen salaries
increase by about 12 percent in the past three years, with an
extra month of bonus annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
