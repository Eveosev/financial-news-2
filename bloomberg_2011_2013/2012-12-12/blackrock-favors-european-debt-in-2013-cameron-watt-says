BlackRock Inc. favors peripheral
European debt in 2013, the world’s largest asset manager said
today in a conference in New York. The European Central Bank
will eventually activate its Outright Monetary Transactions, or
OMT, according to Ewen Cameron-Watt, chief investment strategist
of the BlackRock Investment Institute.  Spanish government debt has gained 4.6 percent this year,
while Italian bonds have returned 19 percent, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data.  On peripheral European debt:  “As far as European euro-zone peripheral bonds are
concerned, fiscal adjustments in Spain and  Italy  have already
taken those countries pretty close to primary balances, fiscal
balances and primary fiscal surpluses. In the case of Italy,
almost beyond the point that they need to get debt
sustainability. Spain has a bit further to go.”  On the ECB’s OMT:  “Yes, OMT will have to be triggered at some point because
the monetary systems are still way apart from each other and the
convergence that Mario Draghi talked about when he brought OMT
up has not yet happened enough in terms of short-dated money
systems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
