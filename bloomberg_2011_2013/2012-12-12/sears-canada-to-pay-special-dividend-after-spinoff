Sears Canada Inc. (SCC) , the largest
department-store chain in the country, said it will pay a
special cash dividend of C$1 ($1) a share following a partial
spinoff of the company from its parent last month.  Sears will pay out a total of about C$102 million on Dec.
31 to shareholders of record as of Dec. 24, the Toronto-based
retailer said in a statement today.  Sears Canada’s largest shareholder other than its parent is
 Edward Lampert , the chairman of Sears Holding Corp. Lampert and
his hedge fund owned about 28 percent of the Canadian retailer’s
shares as of Nov. 21, according to Bloomberg data. The U.S.
parent company, controlled by Lampert, distributed 44.5 percent
of the Canadian unit’s stock to shareholders last month,
retaining a 51 percent interest.  The Canadian retailer has reported 12 straight quarters of
sales declines. It cut its loss by almost 50 percent in the
third quarter to 22 cents a share, compared with a year earlier.
Revenue dropped 6.8 percent to C$1.04 billion as the retailer
reduced promotional and clearance sales.  Sears Canada  will use its 60-year-old credit card database
to create advertising for targeted customers and help return the
retailer to profitability by 2014, Chief Executive Officer
Calvin McDonald said in an interview last week.  The company rose 3 percent to C$11.23 at the close in
Toronto. The shares have gained 7.6 percent this year.  Sears
Holdings , based in  Hoffman Estates , Illinois, fell 2.6 percent
to $42.38 at the close in New York. Its shares have climbed 48
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
