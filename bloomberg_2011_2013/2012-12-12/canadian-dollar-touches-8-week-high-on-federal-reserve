The Canadian dollar touched an
almost eight-week high against its U.S. counterpart before a
Federal Reserve policy statement forecast to bring a new round
of asset purchases to help drive the U.S. economy.  Canada’s dollar gained for a seventh day, the longest
streak since January 2011, as the U.S. central bank prepared to
release a policy statement at around 12:30 p.m. in  Washington ,
followed by forecasts for growth, unemployment and inflation,
and a press conference from Chairman Ben S. Bernanke at 2:15
p.m. The statement is expected to outline $45 billion in monthly
Treasury buying as part of the Fed’s quantitative-easing
strategy to stimulate job growth, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 49 economists. Oil, Canada’s leading export, gained
with global stocks.  “The the expectation is they expand QE3 to buying
Treasuries,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at
 Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  by phone from Toronto. “That would weigh on
the U.S. dollar over time, so I think generally risk assets are
a bit higher.”  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 0.1 percent to 98.55
cents per U.S. dollar at 11:27 a.m. in Toronto today, after
touching 98.53, the strongest since Oct. 19. One Canadian dollar
buys $1.0147.  Crude-oil futures rose 0.8 percent to $86.47 a barrel in
New York. The MSCI World Index of stocks increased 0.3 percent.  Benchmark Canadian 10-year bonds declined, with yields
increasing two basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 1.75
percent. The 2.74 percent note due in June 2022 fell 20 cents to
C$108.69.  Trade Deficits  The  trade deficit  in the U.S.,  Canada ’s largest trading
partner, widened in October, the Commerce Department reported in
Washington yesterday, suggesting cooling economies in  Europe  and
Asia may be eroding demand for American goods even as a drop in
imports may signal slower domestic growth.  Canada’s trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in October,
with falling imports that suggest domestic spending, which
powered the country out of the 2009 recession, may be waning.  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney maintained his status
as the only central banker with a bias to raise interest rates
in a policy statement last week, saying the benchmark could rise
as the economy nears full capacity. The bank has kept the
benchmark rate at 1 percent since September 2010, the longest
pause since the 1950s.  The Fed’s  benchmark rate  is zero to 0.25 percent and
Bernanke has indicated it is likely to stay low until mid-2015.  Canada’s currency has gained 1.1 percent this year versus
nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The greenback has dropped 2.8 percent and the
yen has been the biggest loser, tumbling 10.5 percent. New
Zealand’s dollar leads gainers, up 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
