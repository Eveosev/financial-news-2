The  European Central Bank  would be
required to enter into arbitration procedures with national
regulators to resolve disputes over bank supervision under a
proposal made by France and  Germany .  The arbitration plan was prepared for a meeting of European
Union finance ministers today in Brussels. Governments are
seeking to thrash out a deal to hand bank oversight powers to
the ECB in a bid to ease the bloc’s fiscal crisis. ECB
supervision would be mandatory for euro-area nations and
optional for other EU states.  The proposal would allow national authorities to challenge
opposition from the ECB’s Governing Council to decisions taken
by the central bank’s supervisory board. Disputes would be
resolved “by a committee representing national supervisors of
participating  member states  and the ECB,” according to the
document obtained by  Bloomberg News . The committee’s decision
would have “binding effect for the ECB.”  The proposal would “ensure a clear separation between
banking supervision and monetary policy,” according to the
document. It would also give a fair voice to non-euro nations
that choose to participate in the supervisory system, according
to the document.  Non-euro nations are banned by the EU’s treaties from
sitting on the ECB’s Governing Council, but will be represented
on the institution’s bank oversight board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
