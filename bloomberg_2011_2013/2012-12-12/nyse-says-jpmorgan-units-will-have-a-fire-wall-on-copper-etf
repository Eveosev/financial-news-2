JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  will put a fire
wall between its proposed exchange-traded fund backed by copper
and its metals trading operations, according to a filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The bank will prevent its units from accessing non-public
information on the JPM XF Physical Copper Trust, NYSE Arca Inc.
said in  amendments , dated Nov. 30, to its proposal for the ETF
filed with the SEC. NYSE Arca is the electronic platform of NYSE
Euronext.  Copper consumers including Encore Wire Corp., AmRod Corp.,
Southwire Co. and hedge fund RK Capital LLC oppose the proposed
ETF, saying it may make it more difficult for consumers to get
the metal as it removes supplies from the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
