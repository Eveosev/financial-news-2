Avon Products Inc. (AVP) , the world’s
largest door-to-door cosmetics seller, will cut about 1,500 jobs
globally and exit  South Korea  and Vietnam as part of plan to
save $400 million by the end of 2015.  The steps will result in pretax costs of about $80 million
to $90 million, with $50 million to $60 million recorded in the
fourth quarter, the New York-based company said yesterday in a
statement.  Chief Executive Officer Sheri McCoy, who took over in
April, announced the cost-cutting goal last month and said she
would lower the company’s dividend as it works to recover from
three years of declining profit. The actions announced yesterday
will be completed by the end of next year and account for about
20 percent of Avon’s savings target.  “The new management team is making definitive changes to
the company’s cost structure,”  Connie Maneaty , an analyst at
 Bank of Montreal (BMO)  in New York, wrote in a note today. She rates
the shares outperform, the equivalent of a buy.  Avon fell 1 percent to $14.33 at the close in New York. The
shares have declined 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
