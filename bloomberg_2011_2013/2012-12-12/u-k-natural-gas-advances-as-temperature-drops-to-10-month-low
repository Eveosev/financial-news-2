U.K. natural gas for same-day
delivery rose for a second day as temperatures dropped to the
lowest since February.  The within-day contract added as much as 2.3 percent,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Today’s low
temperature in  London  was minus 4 degrees Celsius (25
Fahrenheit), CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg show. Demand
in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 391 million cubic
meters, the most since February,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Gas for today climbed 0.8 percent to 67.4 pence a therm at
4:46 p.m. London time.  Month-ahead gas  fell for a fifth
consecutive day, losing 0.1 percent to 66.9 pence a therm.
That’s equivalent to $10.79 per million British thermal units
and compares with $3.39 per million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Same-day gas pared its advance as the delivery system
loosened with the nation’s pipelines forecast to  hold  358
million cubic meters at 6 a.m. tomorrow, compared with 345
million at the same time today, National Grid data show.  Imports from  Norway , the biggest external source of U.K.

were at a rate of 43 million cubic meters a day after reaching
46 million on Dec. 6, the most since February, National Grid

compared with about 38,000 at the same time last year, grid data

at Milford Haven in the U.K. on Dec. 19, according to ship data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 261,157 cubic meter tanker, currently
in the Mediterranean, changed destination, the data show. LNG
