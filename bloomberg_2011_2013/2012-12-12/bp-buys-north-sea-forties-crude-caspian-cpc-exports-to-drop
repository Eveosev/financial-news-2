BP Plc bought a cargo of  North Sea 
Forties crude from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at the highest premium
in almost a month. Eni SpA failed to buy Russian Urals blend in
the Mediterranean.  The Caspian Pipeline Consortium will reduce crude exports
from the  Black Sea  in January by 17 percent from this month, a
program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed. Daily exports of
Azeri Light grade from the Turkish port of Ceyhan will increase
by 2.1 percent in next month, a separate schedule showed.  North Sea  BP purchased Forties lot F1216 at 60 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent for loading Dec. 29 to Dec. 31, according to a
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window. That’s up from a Dec. 6 trade at a 40-cent premium and
is the highest since Nov. 13.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days rose 2 cents to 43 cents more
than Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for January settlement traded at $109.69 barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $107.42 yesterday. The February contract
was at $108.06, a discount of $1.63 to January.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni made the Urals crude bid at a discount of 45 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy  on
Dec. 28 to Jan. 1, the survey of Platts showed. That compares
with the last trade at minus 55 cents on Dec. 4.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened 2 cents to a discount of 60 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  No bids and offers were made for the grade in Northwest
Europe, where the  discount  to Dated Brent widened 2 cents to
$1.07 a barrel, from minus $1.05 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  CPC will ship 2.288 million metric tons next month,
compared with 2.75 million tons in December, according to the
loading program. That’s equal to about 572,738 barrels a day,
down from 688,461 this month.  Shipments of Azeri Light via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline will total 19.8 million barrels, or 639,000 barrels a
day, compared with 626,000 barrels a day in December, a separate
schedule showed.  West Africa  Qua Iboe blend increased 1 cent to $2.68 a barrel more than
Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
close to an eight-month high at $2.72 on Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
