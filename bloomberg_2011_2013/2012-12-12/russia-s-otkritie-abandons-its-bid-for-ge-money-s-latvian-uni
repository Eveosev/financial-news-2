Otkritie Financial Corp., the
brokerage partly owned by VTB Group, is withdrawing a bid for GE
Money Bank Latvia to concentrate on the Russian market and its
acquisition of Nomos Bank.  “There has been changes to our strategy related to our
Nomos acquisition,” Alexey Karakhan, an Otkritie spokesman,
said by phone today. “We want to focus on the Russian market so
we will not be acquiring GE Money.”  Otkritie agreed in June to buy GE Money for an undisclosed
amount in a deal that would have given the Russian lender access
to the European Union market. In August, Otkritie bought 19.9
percent in Nomos from the Czech private-equity firm PPF Group.
It plans to buy the rest of Nomos within two years, the Moscow-
based bank said in an August statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
