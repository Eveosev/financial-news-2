Drake & Scull International (DSI)  PJSC
said its German subsidiary won water-treatment contracts in
Romania that include building a plant in Sibiu to produce
drinking water for as many as 200,000 people.  Passavant-Roediger GmbH’s contracts were worth almost $25
million for the river treatment award, for pipes to supply water
to Cisnadie and to replenish reservoirs in Romania, which is
striving to comply with the European Union’s water framework
directive.  A wastewater project in the eastern town of Roman that was
earlier announced made up the balance of orders. Drake, the
Dubai-based supplier of engineering services to the  construction
industry , acquired Passavant in 2009 to expand in the water and
wastewater sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
