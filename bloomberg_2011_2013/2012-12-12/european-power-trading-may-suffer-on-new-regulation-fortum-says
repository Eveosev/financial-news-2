Cross-border electricity shipments
in  Europe  may be restricted because of uncoordinated national
energy policies, Finland’s biggest utility  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  said.  “Incentives for cross-border power trading will suffer if
each country introduces national capacity market designs,”
Simon-Erik Ollus, chief economist and vice president of
industrial intelligence at Fortum, said yesterday at a seminar
in Helsinki.  Countries including Germany, the U.K., France, Italy,
 Poland  and  Belgium  are considering plans to prevent the
premature closing of fossil plants by offsetting low or negative
returns caused by high renewable energy penetration, low power
demand and depressed prices.  The European Commission, the European Union’s regulator,
last month urged governments to avoid introducing uncoordinated
mechanisms that reward plant operators for guaranteeing back-up
capacity when renewable power falls short.  The regulator should take a “strong role in defining
criteria and conditions for the use of capacity mechanisms and
their compatibility, since they have a potentially major impact
and may distort power trading and the location of plant
investments,” Ollus said.  “Countries must prove that the disease is worse than the
cure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
