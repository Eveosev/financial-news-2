BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
fund manager with $3.67 trillion in assets, said it favors
Italian and Spanish debt over bonds from so-called core
countries such as Germany.  The fund’s preferences are contained within its 2013
investment strategy, which has been framed mindful that there is
“danger in safety and income is king,” Rick Rieder, the firm’s
chief investment officer of fundamental fixed-income, told a
media briefing in London.  Italian and Spanish securities have rallied since European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged in September to buy
the bonds of debt-laden euro-area governments to help keep their
borrowing costs down.  Italian bonds handed investors a 19 percent gain this year,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Those of
Spain returned 4.6 percent, compared with a 4.2 percent gain
from German bunds.  The yield on Italian 10-year bonds fell eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 4.64 percent at 5 p.m. London time.
The rate on similar-maturity Spanish debt dropped 10 basis
points to 5.37 percent.  BlackRock also favors high-yielding and emerging-market
debt as well as the  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
