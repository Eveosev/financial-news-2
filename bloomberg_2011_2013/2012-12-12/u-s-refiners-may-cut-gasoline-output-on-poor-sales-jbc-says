Refiners in the U.S. may have to
scale back production of gasoline to avoid a large build in
inventories and a repeat of the reduced processing margins seen
last winter, according to JBC Energy GmbH.  “Lower production would also translate into lower exports
of the motor fuel from the region, which could potentially offer
some relief to the global gasoline market and by extension
refining margins,” the Vienna-based researcher said today in a
research note.  Stockpiles of gasoline rose to 212 million barrels in the
week to Nov. 30, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
That’s the most since April 13. Demand slid 3.7 percent last
week to the lowest level since Nov. 16, according to data
yesterday from MasterCard Inc.  Profit from processing crude in  Europe  are “sufficiently
low to stimulate refinery run cuts,” JBC Energy said.  Margins from using  Brent crude  in northwest Europe dropped
to $5.68 a barrel in November from $9.03 the previous month, the
 International Energy Agency  said today in a report.  Gasoline inventories in  Germany  have risen 2.3 million
barrels since the end of June and were 1.5 million barrels above
the five-year average at the end of October as export access is
limited, the Paris-based IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
