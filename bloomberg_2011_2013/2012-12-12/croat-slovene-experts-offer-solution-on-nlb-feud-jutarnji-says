Croatian and Slovenian experts
proposed a solution to a banking dispute stemming from the
breakup of  Yugoslavia  and threatening to delay  Croatia ’s planned
July 2013 European Union entry,  Jutarnji List  reported, citing
people close to the negotiations.  Slovenia should return to Croatia 278.7 million euros ($362
million) over the next 30 years, while Croatia will not seek
 interest rates  dating from the early 1990s, Jutarnji said. Both
governments are considering the proposal, according to the
Zagreb-based newspaper.  Croatia has barred Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., Slovenia’s
largest bank, from operating in Croatia until the issue is
settled over money owed to Croat savers from the bank’s Yugoslav
predecessor. Croatia took over the debt from about 300,000
former savers from Croatia and had paid them out in the 1990s.
Slovenia said in October it will ratify Croatia’s EU membership
only after the dispute is resolved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
