BP Plc (BP/)  Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley delayed a visit to Baku this week as the company is still
working with the State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan to improve output
at the Caspian field of Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli, Turan news said.  The news agency cited unidentified people. Azeri President
Ilham Aliyev has blamed mistakes by BP for a 12 percent drop in
production at the country’s largest field during the first half.  While Tamam Bayatli, a BP spokeswoman in Baku, was unable
to comment on Dudley’s travel plans, she said by e-mail “he
does visit Baku and hold high level meetings reasonably often as
we have some very important business interests in  Azerbaijan .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
