Taiwan ’s dollar advanced for a
second day on speculation the Federal Reserve will expand asset
purchases that boost the supply of U.S. currency and spur demand
for emerging-market assets.  The Fed will announce today $45 billion in monthly Treasury
buying after a two-day meeting, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. Taiwan’s central bank also meets next week
to review monetary policy after keeping the discount rate on 10-
day loans unchanged at 1.875 percent for the fifth time in a row
on Sept. 20.  “Everybody wants to know what the Fed will say and what
the Taiwan central bank will say,” said Tarsicio Tong, a
Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan. (2838) 
“Next year foreign money, or hot money, will flow into Asia
again if the Federal Reserve conducts more quantitative
easing.”  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.108
against its U.S. counterpart, after a 0.1 percent gain
yesterday, according to data from Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
touched NT$28.959 on Nov. 12, the strongest level since
September 2011. It has appreciated 4.1 percent this year as
overseas investors bought $4.79 billion more Taiwan stocks than
they sold.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 3 percent.  The currency may trade between NT$29 and NT$29.3 for the
rest of the year after the central bank pledged yesterday to
maintain stability in the foreign-exchange market, Tong said.  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 increased one basis point to 1.143 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank
lending  rate was 0.386 percent, a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
