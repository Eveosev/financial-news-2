Suntory Holdings Ltd., the closely
held Japanese whiskey and beer maker, plans to sell shares of
its non-alcoholic drinks and food business in Tokyo, two people
familiar with the matter said.  The company is planning an initial public offering, which
may take place next year and could be announced as early as next
week, one of the people said, asking not to be identified
because the matter isn’t public. Part of the proceeds will be
used to finance mergers and acquisitions, the second person
said.  Suntory may follow rivals Kirin Holdings Co. and  Asahi
Group Holdings Ltd. (2502) , which have sought growth through overseas
deals as a declining population damps domestic demand. Japanese
companies led by  Japan Airlines Co. (9201) , have raised $11.54 billion
from initial public offerings this year, a six-fold increase
from 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Suntory declined to comment, Kenichiro Higashi, a spokesman
for the Osaka-based company said by phone. The beverage maker
plans to raise 500 billion yen ($6.1 billion) by selling shares
of the beverage and food unit and listing on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange next summer, Nikkei reported today, without saying
where it got the information.  Overseas Deals  The unit, Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd., had 970.6 billion
yen in sales for the year ended December 2011 while parent
Suntory Holdings had 1.8 trillion yen, according to a company
statement. The business had about 15,000 employees as of
December 2011, according to the company website.  Suntory has focused overseas acquisitions on non-alcohol
beverages over the past five years. The company bought France-
based Orangina Schweppes Group in 2009 for an undisclosed sum
and paid 600 million euros in 2009 for New Zealand’s Frucor
Beverages Group Ltd.  Suntory had 225 billion yen of cash and savings as of the
end of June, according to a company statement.  JAL’s September IPO raised $8.4 billion, the data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
