The U.S. Department of Energy will
award as much as $169 million to seven proposed offshore wind
projects in six states.  The wind farms, off the coasts of  Maine , New Jersey, Ohio,
 Oregon , Texas and Virginia, will receive as much as $4 million
to complete engineering, site evaluation and other pre-
construction work, the Energy Department said today in a
statement. Three will be selected to get as much as $47 million
to fund construction and operations by 2017, the agency said.  The Energy Department’s  National Offshore Wind Strategy 
calls for 10 gigawatts of offshore wind-power capacity to be
installed by 2020, the equivalent of about 10 nuclear reactors.
There are no offshore turbines in operation in the U.S. now.  “The United States has tremendous untapped clean energy
resources,” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in the statement.
The program “paves the way to a cleaner, more sustainable and
more diverse domestic energy portfolio.”  The wind farms will be developed by Baryonyx Corp. in
Texas; Fishermen’s Energy LLC in New Jersey; Lake Erie  Energy
Development Corp. (EDC)  in Ohio; Principle Power Inc. in Oregon; the
University of Maine and  Statoil ASA (STL)  in Maine; and Dominion
Resources Inc. in Virginia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
