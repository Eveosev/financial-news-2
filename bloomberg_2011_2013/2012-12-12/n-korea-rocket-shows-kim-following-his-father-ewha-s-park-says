Park Joon Young, professor of
international relations at Ewha Womans University in Seoul,
comments by phone on  North Korea ’s rocket launch today. The
launch comes as  South Korea  prepares for a presidential election
on Dec. 19.  “It’s not a surprise. It shows North Korea’s leader is
developing nuclear weapons and missiles regardless of
international pressure.  ‘‘It was inevitable for him to assert North Korea’s
sovereign security. Kim, as a new leader, is flagging that he
will continue on the same course as his late father.  ‘‘At this time, I don’t think the launch will have a huge
impact on results of our election. I think the timing was just a
coincidence.  ‘‘The U.S. is joining forces with other neighboring
countries to block the North’s development of nuclear weapons.
But so far, these collaborated efforts don’t look as though
they’re working properly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
