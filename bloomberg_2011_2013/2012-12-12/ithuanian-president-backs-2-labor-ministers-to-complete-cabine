Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite approved two ministers from the  Labor Party  after
rejecting two previous candidates, completing a new four-party
government that plans to start work tomorrow.  Grybauskaite signed a decree today appointing Algimanta
Pabedinskiene as social security and labor minister, and Dainius
Pavalkis as education and science minister, her office in
Vilnius, the capital, said in an e-mailed statement.  The president vowed to exclude Labor from government after
its leaders were accused of violations in October parliamentary
elections and fraud. After screening and rejecting several Labor
candidates, she agreed to let party members hold four of the
Cabinet’s 14 posts.  Parliament should confirm the entire Cabinet tomorrow,
Prime Minister-designate Algirdas Butkevicius’s spokeswoman,
Evelina Butkute, said by phone after the president’s
announcement. Agreeing on the 2013 budget is top priority, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
