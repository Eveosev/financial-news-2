The Slovak government approved the
sale of a 49 percent stake in the country’s dominant gas company
Slovensky Plynarensky Priemysel AS jointly owned by  E.ON AG (EOAN)  and
 GDF Suez. (GSZ)   Slovak Gas Holding BV, the joint venture that owns the 49
percent stake in SPP, was cleared for sale to Czech private
equity group Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS, the Slovak
government said in a document posted on its website.  Slovak Premier  Robert Fico  said on Nov. 30 he wants the new
owner of SPP to accept tighter price regulation. Fico’s
government, which holds the remaining 51 percent of SPP, is
negotiating with EPH conditions under which it will allow the
transaction.  EPH expects to sign the transaction with the Slovak
government “within several days” and complete the deal in
January 2013, spokesman Martin Manak said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
