Gold futures rose to a one-week high
after the Federal Reserve said it will buy $45 billion a month
of Treasury securities starting in January, expanding its asset-
purchase program to bolster the U.S. economy.  Borrowing costs will stay low “at least as long” as the
unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent and if inflation
“between one and two years ahead” is projected to be no more
than 2.5 percent, the Federal Open Market Committee said today
at the conclusion of a two-day meeting. The dollar dropped for
the third straight day against a basket of major currencies,
boosting the appeal of gold as an alternative asset.  “This is going to continue to make the dollar fall and
metals move higher,” Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity
Trading Corp. in Medford,  Oregon , said in a telephone interview.
“This is bullish for commodities across the board.”  Gold futures for February delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,717.90 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the metal reached $1,725, the highest for a most-
active contract since Nov. 30.  The price is headed for the 12th consecutive annual gain as
central banks from the U.S. to China pledge more steps to spur
economic growth.  Gold rose to a record $1,923.70 in September 2011. UBS AG
said that the metal will top the all-time high next year.  “We don’t think gold has priced in a sizable expansion in
the Fed’s balance sheet beyond current levels, but we do think
that quantitative easing will again loom large in the first half
of 2013,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS in  London , said in a
report before the central’s bank announcement.  Silver Gains  Silver futures for March delivery added 2.3 percent to
$33.782 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest gain since Nov. 19.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $1,646.40 an ounce. The
metal has risen for six straight sessions, the longest string of
gains since Oct. 4.  Palladium futures for March delivery increased 0.6 percent
to $701.15 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
