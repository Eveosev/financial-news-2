Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , the second-
largest U.S. equity exchange operator, said it found errors in
calculating the value for indexes and corrected the data.  The errors took place on Dec. 7 and Dec. 10 and affected
hundreds of gauges including the Nasdaq U.S. Large Cap Index and
Nasdaq 100 Total Return Index, according to a statement sent by
the New York-based company. Nasdaq asked recipients of the data
to remove intraday ticks and the high and low values of the
indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
