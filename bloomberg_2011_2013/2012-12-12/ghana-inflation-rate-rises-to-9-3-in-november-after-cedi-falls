Inflation in  Ghana , West Africa’s
second-biggest economy, accelerated in November after the cedi
weakened against the dollar for the first month since July.  The rate rose to 9.3 percent from 9.2 percent in October,
Philomena Nyarko, acting government statistician with the Ghana
Statistical Service, told reporters today in Accra, the capital.
Prices rose 0.5 percent in the month, she said.  Non-food inflation, which includes transportation,
education and alcohol, climbed to 12.4 percent in November and
food costs increased 3.9 percent from a year earlier, she said.  Ghana’s central bank held its benchmark  interest rate  last
month as inflation pressures eased because the cedi had
stabilized cedi, acting Governor Kofi Wampah said.  The local currency, the cedi, fell 0.7 percent against the
dollar in November after gaining for the previous three months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s declined 13
percent this year, the third-worst among 22 African currencies
compiled by Bloomberg.  The cedi gained less than 0.1 percent to 1.8945 a dollar by
10:59 a.m. in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
