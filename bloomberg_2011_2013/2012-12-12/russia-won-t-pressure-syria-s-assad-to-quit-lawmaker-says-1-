Russia  won’t pressure  Syria ’s
President Bashar al-Assad to quit and wants to include
government representatives in talks on the country’s future, a
senior lawmaker said.  “Assad’s resignation cannot be a precondition for the
start of this process,” Alexei Pushkov, the head of the
foreign-affairs committee in the lower house of parliament, said
in an interview today in Moscow. “This is a sovereign right.”  Western powers are putting “incredible pressure” on
Russia to change its position, which it won’t do, Pushkov said.
U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  last week insisted at a
meeting in Dublin with Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov 
that any transition to a democratic Syria can’t include Assad.  Russia is resisting proposals made by Clinton to help
broker a political transition in Syria by persuading Assad to
relinquish power, Kommersant reported yesterday. Russia believes
the Syrian leader will not agree to quit voluntarily and
suggested that the U.S. and other opponents of the government
lead any talks for Assad’s exit, the Moscow-based newspaper
said, citing sources it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
