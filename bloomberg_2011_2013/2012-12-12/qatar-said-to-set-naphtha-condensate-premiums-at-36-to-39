Qatar International Petroleum
Marketing Co. set the premiums for petrochemical feedstock in
the first quarter of next year at $36 to $39 a metric ton over
benchmark Middle East naphtha prices, according to three people
with knowledge of discussions with buyers.  The state-owned  marketing company  known as Tasweeq agreed
to sell full-range naphtha and plant condensate, the people said,
asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential. An official in the companyâ€™s marketing department
in Doha declined to comment.  Tasweeq sells naphtha and plant condensate on annual
contracts that allow buyers to load one cargo a month containing
30,000 to 50,000 tons, the people said. Prices will be re-
negotiated every quarter. Plant condensate is a light, processed
oil that can be used as feedstock for petrochemical production.
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. set premiums for its naphtha
contract beginning in February at $32 to $34 a metric ton to
 Middle East  prices, two people with knowledge of term
discussions said, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential. Saudi Arabian Oil Co. set its
premiums at $30 to $36 a ton to its benchmark formula for the
first half of 2013, according to three people with knowledge of
the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
