The U.S. leads the International team
6 1/2 to 5 1/2 after the second session of golf’s Presidents Cup
was completed today.  Play was suspended yesterday by darkness at Muirfield Golf
Club in Dublin,  Ohio . Four foursome matches -- or alternating
shot with the same ball -- had to be completed this morning,
with each team winning twice.  Tiger Woods and Matt Kuchar won 4-and-2, meaning they held
an unassailable four-hole lead with two holes to play, over
South Africans Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel. Americans
Steve Stricker and Jordan Spieth also beat South Africans
Branden Grace and Richard Sterne 2-and-1.  Angel Cabrera of Argentina and  Australia ’s Marc Leishman
beat Webb Simpson and Brandt Snedeker 2-and-1, while Australian
Adam Scott and  Japan ’s Hideki Matsuyama defeated Jason Dufner
and Zach Johnson 2-and-1.  Five fourball matches, with each golfer playing his own
ball and the lowest score winning the hole, and five more
foursome matches will be played today. The biennial team event
will conclude with 12 singles matches tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
