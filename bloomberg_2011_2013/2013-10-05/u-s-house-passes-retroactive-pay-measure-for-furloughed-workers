The U.S. House passed a measure that
would provide retroactive pay for government workers who have
been furloughed in the government shutdown, which is in its
fifth day.  The measure passed 407-0 today. Federal workers deemed
essential and who remain on the job are paid for work during a
shutdown. This bill would provide retroactive pay to workers who
aren’t considered essential and aren’t working during the
government shutdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
