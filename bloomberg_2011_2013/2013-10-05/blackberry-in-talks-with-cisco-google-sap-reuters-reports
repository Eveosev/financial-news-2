Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and
 SAP AG (SAP)  are in talks with  BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY)  about buying parts or
all of the Canadian company, Reuters reported, citing
unidentified sources close to the matter.  Potential acquirers also include  Intel Corp .,  LG
Electronics Inc. (066570)  and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the news service
said.  BlackBerry has asked for expressions of interest from
potential buyers, Reuters said, offering an alternative to the
agreement it reached to be bought by  Fairfax Financial Holdings
Ltd. (FFH)  for $4.7 billion.  Reuters said Google, Intel, SAP and Cisco declined to
comment.  A BlackBerry spokesman told the news service it’s
“conducting a robust and thorough review of strategic
alternatives.”  Samsung spokeswoman Chenny Kim declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg today.  “Our official position is that as a matter of policy, LG
doesn’t comment on rumors and speculation,” said LG spokesman
Ken Hong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
