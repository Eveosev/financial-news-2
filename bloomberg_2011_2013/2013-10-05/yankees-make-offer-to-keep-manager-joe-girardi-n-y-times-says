The  New York  Yankees made a contract
offer to manager Joe Girardi before his current deal ends Nov.
1, the  New York Times (NYT)  reported.  The newspaper, which did not say where it got the
information or provide details of the offer, said General
Manager Brian Cashman had coffee with Girardi and met with his
agent, Steve Mandell, over lunch this week.  Girardi, 48, has a 564-408 record in four seasons with the
Yankees, including a World Series championship in 2009.  “We are going to give him a real good reason to stay,”
Cashman said earlier this week in a news conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
