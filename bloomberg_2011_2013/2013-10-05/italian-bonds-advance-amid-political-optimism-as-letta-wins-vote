Italian  government bonds  rose this
week, with two-year yields reaching a two-month low, on optimism
the nation’s political situation has stabilized after Prime
Minister Enrico Letta won a confidence vote in parliament.  Italy ’s 10-year securities climbed as former premier  Silvio
Berlusconi  backtracked on a pledge to bring down the coalition
amid signs his party would desert him. Spanish debt also gained.
Benchmark Portuguese 10-year yields fell the most since July as
the nation passed the eighth and ninth reviews of its aid plan.
German bunds fell as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  refrained from signaling that additional measures were
needed to boost the region’s recovery.  “Peripheral bonds have breathed a sigh of relief that
Letta survived a no-confidence vote,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist at broker RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “Reduced political uncertainty in Italy should help
to stabilize bonds near-term, while disappointment that the ECB
failed to signal an imminent LTRO has weighed on bunds,” he
said, referring to the central bank’s Longer-Term Refinancing
Operations.  Italy’s 10-year yield fell 26 basis points in the week, or
0.26 percentage point, to 4.30 percent at 4:59 p.m. London time
yesterday. The 4.5 percent bond due in March 2024 rose 2.15, or
21.50 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,359) face amount, to 102.055.
Two-year yields fell 25 basis points to 1.64 percent after
dropping to 1.63 percent yesterday, the lowest level since Aug.
7.  Berlusconi’s Future  Letta’s five-month-old coalition won support from 235 of
the Senate’s 321 lawmakers on Oct. 2. Berlusconi’s future in
politics hangs in the balance today after a senate panel
recommended his expulsion from the upper house following an
August tax-fraud conviction. The matter will now be put before
the Senate for a final vote.  The  Portuguese government  raised its 2014 growth forecast
to 0.8 percent from 0.6 percent, while keeping its deficit
targets unchanged as it attempts to exit its bailout program.
 Portugal  is trying to regain full access to debt markets with
the end of the 78 billion-euro rescue plan approaching in June
2014.  The  yield  on Portugal’s 10-year bonds slipped 44 basis
points in the week to 6.4 percent, the biggest drop since the
five-day period ended July 19. The rate on  similar-maturity 
Spanish bonds fell 16 basis points in the week to 4.21 percent.  The benchmark  10-year  (GBTPGR10) bund yield  rose six basis points in
the week to 1.84 percent.  Italian industrial production rose 0.7 percent in August
after a 1.1 percent decline in July, according to the median of
economist estimates in a Bloomberg News survey before the data
next week. An Oct. 7 report is forecast to show euro-area
investor confidence improved this month. Italy is scheduled to
sell bonds on Oct. 11.  Italian bonds returned 4.7 percent this year through Oct.
3, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s rose 9.5
percent and Germany’s advanced 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
