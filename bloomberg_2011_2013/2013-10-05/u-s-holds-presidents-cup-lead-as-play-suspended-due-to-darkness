The U.S. maintained its lead over the
International team as third-day play at golf’s Presidents Cup
was suspended due to darkness.  The U.S. holds an 11 1/2 to 6 1/2 lead at Muirfield Golf
Club in Dublin, Ohio. Play was suspended today with four
foursome matches -- in which teammates alternate hitting shots
with the same ball -- still on the course.  The biennial event is scheduled to conclude tomorrow with
the remainder of today’s play followed by 12 singles matches.  Early play today began with five fourball matches, in which
each golfer plays his own ball and the lowest score wins the
hole.  Americans  Phil Mickelson  and Keegan Bradley beat South
African Ernie Els and Brendon de Jonge of Zimbabwe 2-and-1,
meaning they held a  two-hole lead with one hole to play. Tiger Woods and Matt Kuchar of the U.S. beat Adam Scott of Australia
and Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama 2-up, while Americans Brandt Snedeker and Hunter Mahan won by the same score over South
Africans Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel.  Bill Haas and  Webb Simpson  of the U.S. defeated  Angel
Cabrera  of Argentina and South African Branden Grace 4-and-3.
The international team’s lone fourball win came from Australia’s
Jason Day and Graham DeLaet of Canada, 2-up over  Steve Stricker 
and Jordan Spieth.  The International team led in two of the foursome matches
before play was stopped. The U.S. team led in one and one match
was tied.  -- Editor: Jim McDonald  To contact the reporter on this story:
