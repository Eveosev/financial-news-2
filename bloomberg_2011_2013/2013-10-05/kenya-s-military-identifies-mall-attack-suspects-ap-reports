The identities of four suspects
involved in the deadly attack last month at  Kenya ’s Westgate
Mall were confirmed by the  Kenyan  military, the Associated Press
reported.  Omar Nabhan, Abu Baara al-Sudani, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr
were the men named, AP said, citing Major Emmanuel Chirchir. The
wire service said footage broadcast on television in Nairobi
today showed no more than four gunmen, though the government
earlier said there were as many as 15 attackers.  Al-Kene and Umayr are known to be members of al-Hijra, the
Kenyan arm of the Somali group al-Shabab, AP said, citing Matt
Bryden, the former head of the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia
and Eritrea. Bryden said Nabhan may be a relative of Saleh Ali
Saleh Nabhan, an alleged plotter in the 1998 bombings at U.S.
embassies in Kenya and  Tanzania , AP reported.  The attack at the Westgate Mall on Sept. 21 in Nairobi
killed at least 67 civilians and security personnel. Al-Shabaab,
a militia that’s been fighting to establish an Islamic state in
Somalia since at least 2006, claimed responsibility for the
latest attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
