Iran’s supreme leader,  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said he supports government diplomacy along with
“whatever happened” during President Hassan Rouhani’s trip to
New York, the state-run Iranian Students’ News Agency reported.  Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, said
he was “optimistic” about Iran’s diplomatic delegation. At the
same time, he said some “events” during Rouhani’s visit were
“out of place” and that the U.S. government is “not
trustworthy and arrogant,” according to ISNA.  Rouhani spoke by phone with U.S. President  Barack Obama 
during the trip to the United Nations last month in the highest-level diplomatic encounter between the two countries since
Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution.  Iran’s crude output, once second to Saudi Arabia’s among
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has fallen to
its lowest since 1990 under U.S. and European sanctions imposed
over the country’s pursuit of nuclear technology. The
 International Energy Agency  said Oct. 2 that U.S.-Iranian talks
are “very important” for oil markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
