Centaur Media Plc (CAU) , whose business
magazines include “Marketing Week” and “The Lawyer,” is
close to naming Andria Vidler as chief executive officer,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  Vidler, the former CEO at EMI Music U.K. and Ireland, would
replace Geoffrey Wilmot, who stepped down in May, the people
said, asking not to be identified because the decision isn’t
public.  Adrian Duffield, a spokesman for Centaur Media, declined to
comment. Attempts to reach Vidler for comment were unsuccessful.  Since leaving Centaur, Wilmot has been considering an offer
to buy the company and has held preliminary discussions with
possible financial backers, he said in a statement on Sept. 24.
He has until Oct. 22 to clarify his intentions under U.K. rules,
according to the statement.  Centaur said in a separate statement that no discussions
had taken place between the two over a bid by Wilmot.  Mark Kerswell, the publisher’s chief financial officer
since 2011, has been acting as interim CEO.  Centaur shares have risen 11 percent this year, valuing the
London-based company at 72.9 million pounds ($117 million).  To contact the reporters on this story:
