City Lodge Hotels Ltd. (CLH)  closed at a
month high after saying first-half profit climbed as much as 32
percent as occupancy levels rose and it bought hotels in Africa.  The stock advanced 1.4 percent to 109.54 rand, the highest
daily level since Dec. 24, at the close of trading in
Johannesburg. More than 61,000 shares traded, about 96 percent
of the daily average.  Headline earnings per share, excluding one-time items, for
the six months through December are expected to be 27 percent to
32 percent higher than a year ago, the company said in a
statement today. Johannesburg-based City Lodge is expanding in
Africa outside  South Africa . It bought a 50 percent stake in
Fairview Hotels Ltd., which owns two hotels in Nairobi, in June.
It also plans to spend 2 billion rand ($221 million) growing
operations mainly in East and West  Africa , Business Day reported
Aug. 16, citing Chief Executive Officer Clifford Ross.  “The company is well-positioned to show profit growth as
the cycle normalizes and as they make further investments into
Africa,” De Wet Schutte, a Cape Town-based analyst with Avior
Research Pty Ltd., said by phone. “Occupancies have been
improving nicely. We think they can continue to show profit
growth going forward and I think the market has come to realize
that as well.”  City Lodge’s 30-day historical volatility, a measure of
stock swings, increased to 30.03 from 29.35 yesterday. The
FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s 30-day volatility gauge was at
8.59 from 8.53 previously. A higher reading means an asset price
can have bigger moves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
