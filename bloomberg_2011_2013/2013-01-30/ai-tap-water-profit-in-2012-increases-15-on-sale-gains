Thai Tap Water Supply Pcl (TTW) ,
 Thailand â€™s largest non-state producer of drinking water,
reported a 15 percent increase in profit on higher sales.  Net income  in 2012 climbed to 2.42 billion baht ($17.2
million) from 2.11 billion baht a year earlier, Thai Tap said
today in a regulatory filing. That was in line with the 2.44
billion-baht average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Thai Tap shares have risen 10 percent this year.  Revenue rose 14 percent to 5.27 billion baht while expenses
increased 12 percent to 1.98 billion baht, the company based in
Nakhon Pathom province west of Bangkok said. The board plans to
pay a dividend of 0.30 baht a share on March 29 subject to
shareholder approval at a March 22 meeting, it said.  Thai Tap produces and supplies water in Nakhon Pathom and
Samut Sakhon provinces under a 30-year supply contract signed in
2000 with the state-run Provincial Waterworks Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
