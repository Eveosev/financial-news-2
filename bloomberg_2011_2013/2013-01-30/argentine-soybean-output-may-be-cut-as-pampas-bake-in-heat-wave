Argentina ’s soybean crop output
forecast may be lowered as more high temperatures and low
rainfall are expected for the next two weeks, the chief agro-
climatologist from the largest grains exchange said.  Crop estimates for the Pampas, Argentina’s main soybean
region, should be trimmed on a lack of rain, Eduardo Sierra said
today in an e-mail statement to Bloomberg, before the release of
Buenos Aires Grains Exchange’s weather report. The area is
facing what may be the hottest start to a year in more than half
a century, he said.  The USDA’s  Foreign Agricultural Service  said Jan. 23 it
expects  Argentina’s soybean output  to be 54 million metric tons
and Rosario Grains Exchange said the same day it would be 53
million. A lack of water is a “serious problem” in some
soybean areas, the  Rosario exchange  said in a Jan. 24 report.  “Soybean output for the 2012-2013 crop will stand at 50
million,” said Sierra in a telephone interview from  Buenos
Aires . “We will have a good crop but it isn’t going to be the
big party everybody forecast in December when the rain was
damaging the crop with fungus related diseases.”  Argentina, the world’s largest exporter of soybean oil and
third of soybeans, may be having the hottest January since 1957,
according to Sierra, who has tracked Argentina’s Pampas weather
for the  Buenos Aires Grains Exchange  for almost four decades.  Soaring Prices  Temperatures in the soybean zone will be more than 40
degrees Celsius (104 Farenheit) next week with scattered rains,
Sierra, who forecast a dust bowl for Argentina in December, said
in his report to be published later today by the Buenos Aires
exchange. During the week of Feb. 7-13, temperatures are
expected to exceed 35 degrees Celsius (95 Farenheit), he said.  Soybean futures for March delivery surged 1.7 percent to
$14.7625 a bushel at 10:12 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after earlier touching $14.79, the highest since Dec. 18.  Most fields in Argentina to southern  Brazil  will get less
than 0.5 inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain during the next five
days, before dry weather returns through Feb. 10,  T-Storm
Weather LLC  said in a report today.  The USDA is predicting soybean production in Argentina will
jump 35 percent to 54 million tons after cutting its forecast
from 55 million last month. The USDA will be updating its
forecast on Feb. 8.  The Buenos Aires Grains Exchange will release its first
forecast next week, said an official who asked not to be
identified, according to the exchange’s communications policy.  Argentina farmers are completing soybean planting that will
cover a record area of 19.6 million hectares, surpassing by 3.7
percent the previous record for the 2010-2011 crop, according to
 Argentina’s Agricultural Ministry .  Argentina produced a record soybean crop of 52.6 million
tons in the 2008-2009 season, the ministry has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
