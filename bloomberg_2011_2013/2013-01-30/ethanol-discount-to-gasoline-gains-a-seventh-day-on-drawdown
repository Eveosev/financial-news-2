Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened for a seventh day after a government report showed
record low production and rising stockpiles while inventories of
the motor fuel dropped to a one-month low.  The spread gained 1.43 cents to 58.27 cents a gallon at,
the widest in almost four weeks, after the Energy Information
Administration said ethanol stockpiles rose to a six-week high
even as  output  fell to a record low 770,000 barrels a day. The
report from the Energy department’s statistical arm also showed
that  inventories  of gasoline unexpectedly fell last week.  “It’s a sign that you’re starting to see impact from all
of the idle ethanol plants,” said  Terry Reilly , senior
commodity analyst at Futures International LLC in Chicago. “The
supply is still fairly large.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 5.1 cents, or
2.1 percent, to $2.456 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest since Oct. 11. Prices have advanced 12 percent in
January, heading for the first monthly gains since October.  Gasoline for February delivery jumped 6.53 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $3.0387 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol.  The discount of the grain-based additive to gasoline was
the widest since Jan. 4, based on prompt-month futures
contracts. Ethanol’s streak of losses versus the motor fuel is
the longest since February 2010.  Ethanol  stockpiles  totaled 20.5 million barrels as of Jan.
25, up 2.3 percent from the previous week, the EIA said.  Corn Prices  Corn for March delivery increased 10.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $7.4025 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts, producers are losing 22 cents on
each gallon of the fuel, down from 23 cents yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figures exclude the revenue
that can be made from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Ethanol would increase and output would recover if gasoline
consumption were to improve, Reilly said.  Demand for the motor fuel last week was lower-than-average
for this time of year, Bloomberg  data  shows.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 87 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Jan. 25, compared
with 88 percent the previous week, today’s EIA report showed.  Brazilian Ethanol  Imports of the biofuel fell to 9,000 barrels a day last
week, down from 67,000, the previous week. That’s still 80
percent higher than a year earlier.  Brazil  was the largest
source of ethanol imports in October, according to the EIA.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.13 a gallon in the week
ended Jan. 25, data compiled by Bloomberg show, about 11 percent
cheaper than today’s U.S. futures price. Brazilian ethanol,
derived from sugarcane, is less expensive than the corn-
manufactured U.S. grade.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, will increase gasoline prices at refineries by 6.6
percent, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filing
yesterday, boosting demand for ethanol.  Brazil said today that it will increase the ethanol mix in
gasoline to 25 percent in May from 20 percent.  Ethanol prices advanced in spot market trading. The fuel in
New York harbor rose 5.5 cents to $2.55 a gallon at noon East
Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol
increased 0.5 cent to $2.41 a gallon in Chicago, 1.5 cents to
$2.475 in the U.S. Gulf and 2 cents to $2.615 on the West Coast.  Ethanol in Chicago was 14 cents cheaper than in  New York ,
the widest spread since July. The discount of West Coast prices
to ethanol in the Gulf widened to 14 cents from 13.5 cents
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
