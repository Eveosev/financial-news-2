Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  Chief Game Designer Brian Reynolds, who led the development of titles including
“CityVille 2” and founded the company’s Baltimore studio, is
departing from the largest maker of social games.  Steve Chiang, Zynga’s president of games, confirmed the
departure in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  “Brian has a long history in the game industry and has
been a great partner to the creative leaders at Zynga,” Chiang
said in the statement. “I want to thank him for his leadership
of the Zynga Baltimore studio in the design and development of
‘FrontierVille.’”  Zynga has lost more than a dozen top managers amid slowing
demand for virtual goods and a 75 percent drop in shares since
its December 2011 initial public offering. Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Pincus  said in October that he’ll trim 5 percent of
staff, close his Boston office, and end more than a dozen
titles.  Reynolds founded and led the Baltimore studio known as
Zynga East, which produced the game “FrontierVille.” Prior to
Zynga, he earned acclaim as the lead designer of Sid Meier’s
“Civilization II,” a strategy game developed by MicroProse
Software Inc.  Reynolds didn’t respond to requests for comment.  Zynga shares declined 2.7 percent to $2.53 at the close in
 New York , after sliding 8.5 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
