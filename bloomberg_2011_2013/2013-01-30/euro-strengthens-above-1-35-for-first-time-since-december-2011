The euro strengthened above $1.35
for the first time since December 2011 before a report forecast
to show  economic confidence  in the region improved this month.  The 17-nation currency advanced for a second day against
the dollar as investors await the  Federal Open Market
Committee ’s policy statement today and whether officials will
restate their commitment to asset purchases, or quantitative
easing, to boost the  U.S. economy . South Korea’s won weakened as
a government minister said the country should consider taxes on
 currency trading  to limit “speculative” inflows of capital.  “When we look at the economic data we have had a lot of
positive surprises in the euro area,” said  Niels Christensen ,
chief currency strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “The
Fed will keep the door open for more quantitative easing. That
works out in favor of the euro.”  The euro gained 0.2 percent to $1.3521 at 9:36 a.m. London
time after rising to $1.3527, the strongest since Dec. 2, 2011.
The common currency advanced 0.9 percent to 123.58 yen, the
highest since May 4, 2010. Japan’s currency dropped 0.7 percent
to 91.40 per dollar, the least since June 21, 2010.  An  index  of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area rose to 88.2 this month from 87 in December,
the European Commission will say today, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  The euro rose even as a report showed  Spain ’s  recession 
deepened in the fourth quarter more than forecast, with the
Madrid-based National Statistics Institute saying today that
 gross domestic product  fell 0.7 percent in the three months
through December from the previous quarter, when it declined 0.3
percent. That is more than the 0.6 percent contraction the Bank
of Spain predicted Jan. 23.  Europe Stabilizing  While “it still doesn’t look good in southern  Europe ,”
other reports have signaled the region as a whole is stabilizing
and the euro may climb to $1.37 by the end of March, Nordea
Bank’s Christensen said. The median of 60 analyst predictions
compiled by Bloomberg is $1.31.  The euro has gained 2.9 percent in 2013, the biggest
advance among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar is little
changed and the yen has fallen 5.6 percent.  “The euro will continue to rise over the next few
months,” said Peter Dragicevich, a currency economist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  in Sydney. “Capital is starting
to return back into the  euro zone . We don’t expect a major bout
of risk aversion like we’ve seen over the last few years coming
out of the region.”  South Korea’s won fell 0.3 percent to close at 1,085.46 per
dollar in  Seoul . It rose 8.3 percent in 2012, the most among 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Policy makers will curb “unnecessary use” of foreign
currencies in import transactions by state-run firms and closely
monitor other major companies’ cross-border payments as well as
trading in the non-deliverable forwards market, Deputy Finance
Minister Choi Jong Ku said in a speech in Seoul today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
