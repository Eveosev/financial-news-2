BTA Bank (BTAS) , the Kazakh lender that
restructured its debt last month for the second time since 2010,
said it swung to a profit under international financial
reporting standards.  Net income was 24 billion tenge ($159 million) as of Jan.
1, compared with a loss of 1.02 trillion tenge a month earlier,
after the bank booked a profit as a result of the debt overhaul,
the Almaty-based lender said today in an e-mailed reply to
questions from  Bloomberg News .  BTA creditors agreed last month to reduce its liabilities
to about $3.3 billion from about $11 billion and extend the
maturity of its debt to between three and 12 years. BTA had a
loss of 349.3 billion tenge at the end of December under
domestic requirements.  Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna took over
BTA, the central Asian nation’s biggest bank at the time, two
months before its first default in April 2009. BTA is now the
third-largest lender by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
