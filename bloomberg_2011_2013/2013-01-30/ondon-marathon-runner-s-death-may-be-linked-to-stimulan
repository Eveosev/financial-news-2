The death of a  London  Marathon
runner who posthumously raised a record 1 million pounds ($1.6
million) in charity donations may have been partly caused by a
now-banned stimulant, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Englishwoman Claire Squires, 30, collapsed and died less
than a mile from the finish of the 26.2-mile race last April.
She’d been raising money for the Samaritans, a U.K. counseling
service for people with depression.  An inquest at London’s Southwark Coroners’ Court today
heard that the drug DMAA, a food supplement that hadn’t been
banned at the time, had been found in her system, the  BBC 
reported on its website.  “She had taken a supplement containing DMAA which, on the
balance of probabilities, in combination with extreme physical
exertion, caused acute cardiac failure, which resulted in her
death,” coroner Philip Barlow told the court today.  The court heard Squires had put a scoop of a product
containing DMAA in her water bottle before the race.  DMAA, also referred to as 1,3-dimethylamylamine or geranium
oil and used as a workout or weight-loss aid, was banned by the
U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in
August “amid concerns of potential risks to public safety,” it
said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
