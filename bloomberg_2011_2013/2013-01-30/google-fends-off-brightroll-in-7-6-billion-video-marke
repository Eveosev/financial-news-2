Google Inc. (GOOG) , the world’s biggest
seller of Web-search advertising, is getting one-upped in the
surging $7.6 billion market for online-video ads from a six-
year-old startup one-tenth its size.  BrightRoll Inc., a San Francisco-based company that helps
marketers place video ads on websites, has surpassed Google when
ranked by number of online video ads in two of the last three
months,  according  to researcher  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   Google makes money from selling slots for commercials that
run before users view clips on YouTube, which it owns and
operates. BrightRoll matches marketers to competing websites,
and takes a cut. That has helped it to siphon advertisers away
from Google in a market that, according to AccuStream Research,
 jumped  52 percent last year as more people watch television and
movie programming online.  “BrightRoll and Google are neck-and-neck,” said  Dan
Piech , a senior product manager at ComScore. “BrightRoll has
been doing an amazing job in growing their business.”  Like an old-fashioned ad agency, BrightRoll acts as an
intermediary between marketers and content providers. Instead of
buying ad space during a television show on behalf of clients,
BrightRoll finds websites and companies seeking to run video
ads, gets them together, and then takes a cut when they make a
deal. While Google concentrates mainly on selling ads on
YouTube, the biggest Web-video site, it also competes with
BrightRoll with a similar agency-style service.  BrightRoll has kept up the pressure by offering advertisers
a  network  of more than 6,000 mobile applications and websites to
target a wider audience, and also offers tools to help them
measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.  Reaching Scale  About five percent of large television advertisers’ media
budgets are going into Web videos, and the percentage is higher
for industries such as cars, according to Tod Sacerdoti, chief
executive officer of BrightRoll. Video will  account  for 14.5
percent of all U.S. digital-ad revenue in 2016, up from 7.9
percent last year, according to EMarketer Inc.  “Online video is finally at the scale that’s big enough
for national advertisers,” said Sacerdoti, previously an
executive at online address-book provider Plaxo Inc. “It’s
large enough to matter.”  Co- founded  in 2006 by Sacerdoti, BrightRoll has also
partnered with Arlington, Virginia-based Veenome Inc., which
helps advertisers find content and track campaigns. Veenome is
just one of several video-ad technology startups -- including
 Eyeviewdigital Inc.  and  Brainient Ltd.  -- that received venture
funding in the past year.  Venture Funding  BrightRoll, which has 220 employees, has raised $46 million
in venture funding to date, Sacerdoti said. The last investment
round of $30 million in November 2011, was led by Trident
Capital, and included existing investors True Ventures, Scale
Venture Partners and Adams Street Partners.  After trailing BrightRoll in October and November, Google
took back the lead in December by serving 2 billion video ads on
personal computers in the U.S., versus 1.83 billion for
BrightRoll, ComScore said. While Google delivered more ads,
BrightRoll’s network of video providers reached a larger part of
the population, at 43 percent, compared with Google’s 32 percent
in December. ComScore’s data excludes some video ads that reach
Google’s sites from third-party networks, including BrightRoll.  BrightRoll works with 90 percent of the top 50 U.S.
advertisers, and has doubled revenue annually for the past five
years. At that growth rate, BrightRoll “could easily be doing
over $100 million per year in revenue,” according to  Tom Taulli , an independent analyst who covers initial public
offerings.  Google, YouTube  Growth in search-based advertising -- Google’s main cash
cow -- has fueled a 30 percent gain in the company’s shares over
the past year, compared with a 12 percent rise in the Nasdaq
Composite Index. Google, based in  Mountain View ,  California ,
rose less than 1 percent to $753.83 at the close in  New York .
Three-quarters of analysts  tracking  the stock rate Google a buy,
at an average price target of $824.83, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Google acquired YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion to boost
its video content, which attracts more than 800 million monthly
unique visitors. Google generates video-ad revenue of about $1.3
billion a year, said  Brian Wieser , an analyst at Pivotal
Research Group LLC.  Video-Ad Tools  Many advertisers remain reluctant to plunge into online
video ads because much of the content is created by consumers.
They’re concerned that commercials might appear alongside low-
quality or inappropriate content, according to EMarketer.  “The content is often unsafe for brands, or too short to
support advertising,” said  Clark Fredricksen , a spokesman for
EMarketer.  This year, Google and BrightRoll plan to introduce new
analytical tools that would provide advertisers with better data
on responses to their ads. Both are also stepping up efforts to
target viewers on mobile devices. Google subsidiary AdMob, which
delivers ads to mobile devices,  added  BrightRoll as a video-ad
provider in May. The partnership lets AdMob offer its clients a
wider pool of video providers to advertise on mobile devices, an
emerging area of online advertising.  BrightRoll also lets advertisers bid for online commercials
in real-time, as they are delivered.  “Real-time bidding is the fastest-growing part of our
business,” Sacerdoti said. “It will be the biggest growth
driver in the next 24 months.”  Interactive Commercials  BrightRoll has also introduced tools that make it easier
for advertisers to analyze ad-campaign performance against
benchmarks, and roll out interactive online commercials, which
let viewers design a car, for example.  “We are able to target the right consumer easier,” Bob
Arnold, associate director of global digital strategy at cereal-
maker  Kellogg Co. (K) , said in an interview. “Sometimes it can be
cheaper, and we feel we have a little more control.”  Aside from bringing more original content to YouTube,
Google already offers a number of channels on topics such as
cars, entertainment and fashion. It has also pioneered new ad
formats, such as TrueView, which lets viewers select which video
ads they want to watch.  “Viewers are choosing to watch the ads,” Baljeet Singh,
group product manager at YouTube, said in an interview. “The
lines between ads and content are starting to blur.”  About 182 million U.S. Internet users  watched  38.7 billion
online content videos in December, according to ComScore.  “We’ve been gaining share, and a lot of it has been driven
by having a platform that’s working,” Sacerdoti said. “YouTube
is a huge player, but there’s very strong interest in
alternatives to YouTube.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
