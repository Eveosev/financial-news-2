Chinese  stocks  rose, led by property
companies and brokerages, as the  Shanghai  Composite Index
extended its  bull-market  rally.  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  led a gauge of property developers to a 21-
month high as  Fitch Ratings  said Chinese homebuilding volumes
will rise this year.  China  Merchants Securities Co. led
brokerages higher after Taiwan’s securities regulator said the
island will double the limit on mainland Chinese institutions’
securities investments.  China Resources Sanjiu Medical &
Pharmaceutical Co. (000999)  paced declines among health-care shares as
technical indicators signaled the stocks are overbought.  The Shanghai Composite rose 1 percent to 2,382.48, its
highest close since May 30. The index has climbed 22 percent
since Dec. 3, signaling a bull market to some investors. The  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  climbed 0.5 percent to 2,688.71, taking its surge
since Dec. 3 to 28 percent. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  gained 0.9 percent.  “The rally will remain strong as the local economy has
shown evidence that it’s growing steadily,” Zhang Haidong, an
analyst at Tebon Securities Co., said by phone from Shanghai.
“We have risen a lot so there is a requirement for a
correction. But this year, we are bound to gain.”  The Shanghai  gauge  is valued at 13.1 times reported profit,
the highest level since March 13, after it exited its longest-
ever bear market yesterday. A 756-day stretch without a 20
percent gain from Nov. 8, 2010 through Dec. 3 is the longest on
record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Birinyi
Associates Inc. The gauge fell 38 percent during the period.  Higher Volumes  The  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  has risen from a four-year low last
month on signs of an economic recovery and a government pledge
to bolster urban development. A government report showed on Jan.
27 industrial companies’ profits jumped 17.3 percent in
December. A preliminary reading for a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
last week showed manufacturing expanded at the fastest rate in
two years.  Average trading volumes in the Shanghai index were 17
percent higher than the 30-day average. Its 30-day  volatility 
was at 17.6, compared with last year’s average of 17.1.  Gemdale surged 9.8 percent to 7.84 yuan, while  China Vanke
Co. (000002)  added 3.8 percent to 12.67 yuan. A gauge of developers in
the Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.1 percent to the highest
level since April 18, 2011. Homebuilding volumes will rise this
year, Fitch Ratings said in a statement yesterday, citing
improved funding to developers and increased regulatory
certainty.  China Merchants added 3.8 percent to 12.77 yuan. Huatai
Securities Co. gained 3 percent to 10.48 yuan. Taiwan’s
securities regulator said yesterday the island will double the
limit on mainland Chinese institutions’ securities investments
in Taiwanese markets to $1 billion.  Boosting Confidence  The comments came after a meeting yesterday between China
Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman  Guo Shuqing  and
Taiwan’s top market regulator, Chen Yuh-chang, in Taipei.  China may relax asset requirements for Taiwan brokerages
seeking quotas under the Qualified Foreign Institutional
Investment program, Tong Daochi, the CSRC’s director general of
international affairs, told reporters in Taipei yesterday. Funds
from outside China invest in the country’s capital markets
through the QFII program.  “Policies such as planning to allow more Taiwan brokerages
into the market are a boost to sentiment,” Tebon’s Zhang said.
“It shows the market reforms are materializing.”  Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. (000625)  jumped 2.8 percent to 8.50
yuan, the highest close since Nov. 23, 2009. The company sees
its 2012 net income rising between 45 percent and 65 percent,
according to a statement to the exchange.  Drug Stocks  A  gauge  of CSI 300 health-care stocks dropped 0.5 percent,
the most among 10 industry groups. The index’s 14-day relative
strength index, which measures how rapidly prices have advanced
or declined in that time period, was at 72.18 yesterday. Some
analysts see a reading of more than 70 as a signal to sell.
Sanjiu Medical dropped 2.2 percent to 28.28  yuan .  In U.S. stock trading, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
climbed 0.5 percent to a five-year high as companies including
Pfizer Inc. reported earnings that beat analysts’ projections.  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the largest Chinese
ETF in the U.S., gained 1.4 percent to $41.55 in  New York , the
steepest advance in almost four weeks.  The rally in the Shanghai market “should be more
supportive for shares listed in the U.S.,” Charlie Awdry, a
portfolio manager for Henderson Global Investors’ 500 million
pound ($787.8 million) China Opportunities Fund, said by phone
yesterday from London. “If you look at the data, the Chinese
economy is performing a little more robustly. If positive
sentiment spreads, that would be good news.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
