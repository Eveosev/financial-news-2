JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  traders placed
bets on the opposite side of a derivatives position that led to
more than $6.2 billion in losses, and U.S. Senate investigators
are reviewing how that happened, Reuters reported.  The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is
looking into how different units within the New York-based bank
ended up on opposites sides of the same trade, the news service
said today, citing an unidentified person familiar with the
matter. The opposing trades were much smaller than the money-
losing position, Reuters reported, without specifying the value.  Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, and Elise Bean,
staff director for the Senate panel, declined to comment.  A report by the committee, led by U.S. Senator Carl Levin,
a Michigan Democrat, probably will be released in coming weeks,
people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
