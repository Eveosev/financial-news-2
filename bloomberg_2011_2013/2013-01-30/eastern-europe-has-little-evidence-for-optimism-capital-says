Eastern  Europe  has “little
evidence” to justify improved  market sentiment  driven by more
global appetite for risk, Capital Economics Ltd. said.  Growth in the region probably “slowed sharply” in the
fourth quarter, economists at Capital led by  Neil Shearing  in
London wrote today in an e-mailed note. Gross domestic product
rose an average 1 percent last quarter, down from 1.5 percent in
the third quarter and 4.8 percent in 2011, Capital estimated.  The euro area, the biggest export destination and main
source of investment and bank financing for emerging Europe,
remains in recession. Growth continued to slow even in former
“star performers,” Russia and Poland, Capital said.  “The latest hard data suggest that activity in the region
slowed sharply at the end of 2012, driven by weakening domestic
demand,” the economists said. “Leading indicators are still
consistent with weak growth at best in  Germany  and continued
recession in the rest of the euro zone.”  Russia’s economy probably expanded 2 percent from a year
earlier last quarter, its weakest pace since 2009, Capital
predicted. GDP for the whole of last year probably expanded 3.5
percent, down from 4.3 percent in 2011, it said.  Poland ’s economy grew 0.8 percent from a year earlier in
the fourth quarter, compared with 1.4 percent in the previous
three months, based on preliminary 2012 figures released last
week, Capital said. The main drag on growth was the first
decline in private consumption since at least 1996, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
