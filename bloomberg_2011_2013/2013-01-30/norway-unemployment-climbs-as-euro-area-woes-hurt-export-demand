Norway ’s jobless rate unexpectedly
rose for a third month in the December quarter as a recession in
the euro area and a strong currency weigh on exports.  Unemployment climbed to 3.6 percent from 3.5 percent in the
previous period, Oslo-based Statistics Norway said today. The
figure exceeded the 3.4 percent average forecast of seven
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  A recession in Europe, Norway’s biggest trading partner,
has started to hurt exports, which fell an annual 8.6 percent in
January, according to Statistics Norway. Growth in the  mainland
economy,  which excludes oil, gas and shipping, is estimated to
slow to 3 percent in 2013 from 3.75 percent last year, according
to central bank forecasts.  Policy makers held the central bank’s benchmark rate
unchanged at 1.5 percent in December while sticking to a plan to
raise rates as early as next month.  Norway’s petroleum wealth has so far shielded western
 Europe ’s largest oil exporter from the fallout of the euro area
debt crisis. Record investments in the oil and gas industry have
fuelled demand for labor, pushing up wages.  The krone slid 0.3 percent to 7.4725 per euro as of 10:19
a.m. in Oslo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
