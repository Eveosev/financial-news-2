Israel  Cleantech Ventures, an
investor in energy, water and environmental technology
companies, received about $74 million for its second fund.  The commitments nearly match the investment company’s debut
fund raised in 2007, Israel Cleantech said today in an e-mailed
statement. Black Coral Capital is a returning investor and the
company didn’t name the other participants.  The company, based in Ramat Hasharon, Israel, has backed 15
companies and expects to continue investing in renewable-energy
production, wastewater treatment, energy efficiency and storage,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
