Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman said “some degree of
bipartisanship” in Washington could help solve the U.S. fiscal
debt problem.  “We’ve got this huge mountain of debt on our shoulders,”
Oberhelman said today at a speech sponsored by Elmhurst College
in  Oakbrook Terrace , Illinois. Working on a solution to reduce
the fiscal debt “could help us immediately,” he said.  Education and immigration reform also would support growth,
Oberhelman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
