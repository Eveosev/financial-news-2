Denmark will invite bids this year
to build 1,500 megawatts of  offshore wind  as it seeks to almost
double the share of energy it gets from the resource by 2020.  Tenders will be for two large farms and smaller projects in
as many as  eight areas  closer to the shore delivering power by
2020, the Danish Wind Industry Association said in a  statement .  Developing offshore wind power is key to a March 22 accord
between the ruling and opposition parties to cut greenhouse gas
emissions and fossil fuel use. The deal aims to replace half of
the nation’s coal demand with renewables and increase the share
of wind power to 50 percent, from  28 percent  last year.  The country had 4,162 megawatts of wind power installed as
of December, according to the Danish Energy Agency’s  website .  Bidding will start with the 400-megawatt Horns Rev-3 farm
and 600-megawatt Kriegers Flak site, to be connected to the grid
in January 2017 and July 2018, respectively. Smaller farms will
produce a total 500 megawatts, the association said yesterday.  Dong Energy A/S, Denmark’s biggest utility, is building the
country’s largest offshore farm at  Anholt , with output seen in
the first half at 400 megawatts, 4 percent of national demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
