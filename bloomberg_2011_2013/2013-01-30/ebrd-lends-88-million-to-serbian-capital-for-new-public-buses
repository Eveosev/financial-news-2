The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development will provide as much as 65 million euros ($88
million) to help Belgradeâ€™s municipal transport company buy 400
buses.  The eight-year loan, with a two-year grace period, will
finance the purchase of 200 low-floor diesel buses and a further
200 will be bought from local manufacturers to meet growing
demand in the city of 2 million, the London-based lender said in
an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
