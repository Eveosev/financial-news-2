National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  Chief
Executive Cameron Clyne has ruled out large job cuts at
 Australia ’s fourth-largest lender by market value, the Finance
Sector Union said in a statement.  In a meeting with the union’s National Secretary Leon
Carter and National Assistant Secretary Geoff Derrick on Jan.
24, Clyne said the bank had no plans to slash jobs, according to
the statement. The Union represents about 50,000 employees
across the Australian financial services sector.  Clyne “acknowledged that the Australian business was in
good shape and it would be a mistake to make big cuts here in
response to problems overseas,” according to the statement.
“Having said that he went on to say that ‘incremental change’
would continue as the bank sought to control costs and improve
efficiency.”  The meeting between Clyne and unions came after the
Australian newspaper on Jan. 16 flagged the possibility of job
cuts at NAB in March. It also follows moves by Australian banks
to protect  profit margins  by cutting jobs as loan growth slows
to the lowest level in more than three decades.  Sharna Rhys-Jones, a Melbourne-based spokeswoman for NAB,
confirmed the meeting between Clyne and the union did take place
last week. She declined to comment on discussions at the
meeting.  “We have an open and constructive relationship with the
FSU and meet with them regularly to provide updates,” she said
by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
