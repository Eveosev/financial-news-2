Prosecutors of two Italian cities
probing past irregularities at  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena
SpA  and the bank’s supervision by regulators will probably meet
this week to discuss how to coordinate their investigation, a
person familiar with the probes said.  Prosecutors in Siena, where Monte Paschi is based, and in
the southern city of Trani have a mutual interest in avoiding
overlaps, said the person who asked not to be named because
details of the investigations are not public.  Siena prosecutors are probing the past management for
alleged market manipulation, false accounting, obstruction to
regulatory activity related to the acquisition of Banca
Antonveneta SpA and fraud related to derivatives trades, the
person also said. Prosecutors in Siena also are investigating
the bank under a law on company responsibility for crimes
committed by its executives, the person said, adding that the
prosecutors have been cooperating for months with regulators,
including the Bank of  Italy .  Prosecutors in Trani opened an investigation into the
supervision of Monte Paschi by the central bank and market
watchdog Consob, consumer group Adusbef said in an e-mailed
statement today. The investigation follows a complaint submitted
by the lobby earlier this year.  The Rome-based Bank of Italy said Jan. 23 that Monte
Paschi’s derivatives transactions are being reviewed by its
oversight division as well as judicial authorities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
