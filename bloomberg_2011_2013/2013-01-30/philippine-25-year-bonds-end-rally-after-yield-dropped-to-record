Philippine 25-year  government bonds 
fell, halting a four-day gain, on speculation a 33 basis point
drop in yields this month made the debt expensive. The peso rose
for a second day.  The yield reached a record low of 5.25 percent yesterday
after the central bank reduced the interest paid on almost 1.7
trillion pesos ($41.8 billion) in special-deposit accounts to
curb currency speculation. Philippine bonds returned 2.7 percent
this year, the most among 10 Asian indexes compiled by HSBC
Holdings Plc.  “Bond yields are rising from yesterday’s low on profit-
taking,” said Jill Singian, a fixed-income portfolio manager at
 Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI)  in  Manila . “The greater
magnitude of the decline in yields was because of the SDA rate
cut. In the medium term, we’re still bond-positive.”  The yield on the 6.125 percent notes due October 2037 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.28 percent as
of 4:08 p.m. local time, according to prices from Tradition
Financial Services.  The economy expanded 6.3 percent in the three months
through December from a year earlier, after growing 7.1 percent
in the prior quarter, according to the median  estimate  of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before data due tomorrow.  Gross domestic product “definitely” increased more than
the 5 percent to 6 percent goal last year, President  Benigno
Aquino  said yesterday. Inflation will probably be 2.5 percent to
3.4 percent this month, after averaging 3.2 percent in 2012,
central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said Jan. 28.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 40.630 per dollar in
Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It reached 40.550 on
Jan. 14, the strongest level since March 2008. The currency
appreciated 1 percent in January, the third-best performance
among Asia’s 11 most-active exchange rates.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, was unchanged at 4.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
