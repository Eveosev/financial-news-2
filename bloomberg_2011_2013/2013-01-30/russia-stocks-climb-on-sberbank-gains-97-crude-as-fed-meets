Russian (INDEXCF)  stocks erased gains as the
economy in the U.S unexpectedly shrank in the fourth quarter,
damping the outlook for global growth.  The Micex Index lost 0.4 percent to 1,543.43 by the close
in Moscow, after advancing as much as 0.6 percent earlier. Of 50
stocks, 36 dropped and 14 gained. The dollar-denominated  RTS
Index (RTSI$)  declined 0.3 percent to 1,618.77. VTB Group, Russia’s
second-biggest lender, retreated 3.3 percent.  Gross domestic product in the U.S. dropped at a 0.1 percent
annual rate, weaker than any economist forecast in a Bloomberg
survey and the worst performance since the second quarter of
2009, when the world’s largest economy was still in recession,
Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington . Oil,
Russia’s main export, pared gains after the data.  “This news may lead to a correction on the U.S. and
Russian markets,” Kirill Bagachenko, who manages about $3
billion in Russian equities at TKB BNP Paribas Investment
Partners in  St. Petersburg , said by phone. “If the U.S. is
facing a recession, it’s unclear what else the Fed could do to
help the situation.”  OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender and the stock with
the  heaviest weighting  in the gauge, rose 1.1 percent to 107.75
rubles. The lender added as much as 1.3 percent yesterday before
closing down 0.4 percent.  Preferred shares of OAO Surgutneftegas rallied the most on
the index as Citigroup Inc. named Russia’s fourth-largest oil
producer a top pick in the oil and gas sector and raised its
price estimate to 99 cents. Citigroup cited  “strong” price
growth, a “generous” dividend policy and expectations the
stock will benefit from the introduction of a so-called T+2
settlement on the Moscow Exchange, according to today’s e-mailed
note.  Dividend Stocks  Surgut’s preferred stock rose 3.5 percent to 23.030 rubles,
the highest level since February 2007. The amount of shares
traded was 67 million, equivalent to about 2.8 times the three-
month average. BCS Financial Group recommended buying Surgut
preferred and ordinary shares and selling the stock of OAO
Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil producer, in an e-mail today.
Rosneft retreated 1.6 percent to 266.81 rubles.  Russian  dividend-paying  stocks will outperform this year as
the government increases pressure on lifting payouts, according
to UralSib Capital in an e-mailed note today. Dividend stocks
tend to outperform the market between January and May, with
February being the “strongest” month, according to UralSib.  The Micex’s  10-day volatility  rose to 12.996. The number of
shares traded on the gauge was 80 percent above the 10-day
average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Standard & Poor’s  GSCI
Index of commodities  climbed 0.4 percent to 673.28 after rising
0.8 percent yesterday.  Polyus Deposits  Polyus Gold International Ltd. surged in  London  and Moscow
as RIA Novosti reported the gold producer is selling four gold
deposits for more than $2 billion. The shares added 1.8 percent
in Moscow, while rising as much as 4.3 percent in London, the
highest level since its listing in June.  Crude oil traded up 0.2 percent at $97.77 a barrel in  New
York . Russia receives about half of its budget revenue from oil
and natural gas.  The Micex rose earlier on speculation the  Federal Open
Market Committee  will renew its commitment to asset buying
during a two-day meeting that started yesterday.  Tin, nickel and lead rose on the London Metal Exchange. The
 Russian Depositary Index (RDXUSD)  lost 0.6 percent to 1,821.13.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, was little changed at $30.97
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the  stock futures , increased 1.8 percent to 20.42.  The Micex trades at about 5.7 times  estimated earnings  and
has added 5.7 percent this year. That compares with a multiple
of 11 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which has
gained 1.7 percent over the same period.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21  emerging markets  tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
