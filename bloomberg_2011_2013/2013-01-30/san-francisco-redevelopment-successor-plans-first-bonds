The successor to the  San Francisco 
Redevelopment Agency plans to sell as much as $160 million in
bonds in the first issue of new debt to back a project by one of
the blight-fighting organizations in  California  since lawmakers
eliminated them a year ago.  Proceeds will be used to reimburse the developer of San
Francisco’s Mission Bay South redevelopment project for public
improvements, according to a  staff report  to the oversight board
of the Successor Agency, which inherited responsibility for
redevelopment in the city. The project is to include 6,000
housing units, a medical center and offices.  Acting on a request by Governor  Jerry Brown , the
legislature eliminated the state’s 400 redevelopment agencies a
year ago to help balance the budget. Lawmakers approved a bill
last year  clarifying  that “successor agencies” could issue new
debt to fulfill contracts with developers.  “There may be people who have questions because
‘redevelopment’ is in the name, but people are familiar” with
community facilities districts, said Catherine Reilly, project
manager for San Francisco’s Successor Agency. “I assume the
market would look at them comparable to any other CFD.”  Community facilities districts finance public improvements
such as roads and sewers by adding taxes on property inside of a
defined area. The defunct redevelopment agencies earmarked  tax
revenue  from increases in property values spurred by new
development to repay bonds that financed the improvements.  Pricing information and a sale date for the Successor
Agency bonds haven’t been made public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
