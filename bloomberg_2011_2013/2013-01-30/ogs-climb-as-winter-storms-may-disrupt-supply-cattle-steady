Hog prices rose for the third
straight day on speculation that U.S. meatpacker demand will
increase. as winter weather disrupts the movement of animals.
Cattle futures were little changed.  About 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) to 6 inches of snow fell
in the southwest to east central areas of  Iowa  over the past 12
hours with some areas receiving as much as 8 inches, Joel Widenor, a vice president for Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a telephone interview.  “We’re under winter-weather warnings, so there’s not going
to be many hogs moved today,” Lou Arens, a broker at PCI
Advisory Services, said in a telephone interview from Waucoma,
Iowa. “That should in turn entice the packers to pay up a
little bit for them.”  Hog futures for April settlement increased 0.3 percent to
89.9 cents a pound at 10:22 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Through yesterday, the price rose 4.5 percent this
month.  The  National Weather Service  has issued a winter-storm
 warning  until 12 p.m. central time for parts of the state.  Cattle futures for April delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $1.33025 a pound in  Chicago .  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement climbed 0.2
percent to $1.491 a pound on the CME.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
