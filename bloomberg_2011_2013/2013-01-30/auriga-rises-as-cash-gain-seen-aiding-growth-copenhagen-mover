Auriga Industries A/S (AURIB)  rose to its
highest price in more than two years after Danske Bank A/S
advised clients to buy the stock amid bets  Denmark ’s largest
pesticide maker is poised for growth after cutting its debt.  Auriga jumped as much as 3.9 percent to 107 kroner, the
highest since November 2010. The stock also traded at that price
at 10:48 a.m. in Copenhagen with trading volume at 92 percent of
the three-month daily average.  The Lemvig, Denmark-based company said yesterday it has
agreed to sell its Swiss unit, booking a profit of about 40
million kroner ($7 million). Danske said today the sale will
help Auriga’s capital position and increased its recommendation
on the stock to buy from hold.  “The good cash flow generation also means Auriga is
slightly less restricted in terms of future top-line growth,”
Danske said in a note. The Copenhagen-based bank raised its 12-
month price estimate on the share to 125 kroner from 90 kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
