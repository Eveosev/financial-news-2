Record Olympic swimming champion
Michael Phelps added golf clubs to his list of endorsements,
signing an agreement to use custom-made Ping equipment on the
course.  Phelps will debut his new clubs and other gear in today’s
pro-am at the U.S. PGA Tour’s Phoenix Open, where he’ll be
paired with Masters Tournament champion Bubba Watson, also a
Ping endorser.  The 27-year-old Phelps, who collected a record 22 medals,
including an all-time high of 18 golds, has been working on his
golf game since retiring from competitive swimming. He is being
coached by Hank Haney, Tiger Woods’s former coach, as part of a
Golf Channel reality show.  “I know how difficult the game of golf is, but I’m really
serious about getting better,” Phelps, who started playing golf
five years ago, said in a statement.  Terms of the contract weren’t disclosed by closely held
Karsten Manufacturing Corp.’s Ping, which is based in Phoenix.  At 6-foot-4, Phelps needed clubs an inch longer than
standard length, three degrees upright and with grips 1/32-inch
over standard size in diameter, the company said. The clubs were
also made with gold, red, white and blue accents, Ping said.  Phelps has endorsement contracts with  other non-swimming
companies, including  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , Subway Restaurants
Inc. and  Under Armour (UA)  Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
