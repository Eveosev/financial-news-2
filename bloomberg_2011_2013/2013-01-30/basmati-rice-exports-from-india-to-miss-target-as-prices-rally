India , the world’s largest producer
of aromatic basmati rice, may miss a target to boost exports 25
percent this year as a rally in domestic prices curbs demand
from buyers in Europe and the  Middle East , a trade group said.  Shipments of the grain, which can fetch about double the
rate of traditional white rice, may total 3.5 million metric
tons in the year ending March 31, less than the 4 million tons
forecast in August, M.P. Jindal, president of the All India Rice
Exporters’ Association, said in an interview on Jan. 28. Exports
were 3.2 million tons in 2011-2012, he said.  Prices in India rallied 38 percent this year after the
government raised rates for the non-basmati variety to a record,
potentially hurting earnings at exporters such as  KRBL Ltd. (KRB) ,
 Kohinoor Foods Ltd. (KFL)  and  LT Foods Ltd. (LTFO)  Farmers may boost planting
to benefit from the surging cost of the grain used to make
dishes including biryani and pilaf, potentially doubling the
harvest and increasing exports, said Vijay Setia, a former
president of the association.  “Buyers are placing smaller orders because of higher
prices,” Setia said in a phone interview. “I don’t see
improvement in exports this quarter.”  The average price of basmati has climbed to $1,100 a ton
from $800 a year earlier, said R.S. Seshadri, a director at
Tilda Riceland Pvt., a New Delhi-based exporter. Benchmark 100
percent grade-B Thai rice costs $616 a ton.  Shares of Kohinoor  fell  0.3 percent to 29.80 rupees, while
KRBL climbed 5.4 percent to 26.60 rupees in Mumbai today.  India, Pakistan  Basmati paddy production may double next year from 5.7
million tons in 2012-2013, Setia said. Exports were 2.5 million
tons in the nine months ended Dec. 31, compared with 2.2 million
tons a year earlier, he said.  India controls 65 percent of the overseas basmati market,
according to the state-run Agricultural and Processed Food
Products Export Development Authority, while  Pakistan , the only
other main producer in the world, accounts for the rest.  The aromatic rice variety, specific to a geographic region,
is cultivated in the states of Haryana,  Uttar Pradesh  and
Uttarakhand in India, and in Punjab that straddles both the
South Asian countries.  Saudi Arabia and Iran are two major buyers of Indian
basmati. The U.S., Europe and Africa also purchase the grain.  India’s rice exports including the non-basmati variety, are
set to to drop 23 percent to 8 million tons in 2012-2013 from
10.4 million tons in 2011-2012, according to the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture . Production may fall to 99 million tons from
104.3 million tons, according to the agency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
