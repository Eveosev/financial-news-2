Avery Dennison  Corp. agreed to sell
two units to  CCL Industries Inc. (CCL/B) , a maker of specialty
packaging, for $500 million in cash after  3M Co. (MMM)  walked away
from an offer for its office products division in October.  A syndicate of banks has committed to provide debt
financing to complete the deal, which includes the office-
products business and Avery Dennison’s label-converting unit,
Toronto-based CCL Industries said today in a statement.  The deal ends Avery Dennison’s search for a buyer for the
office-products unit, which sells labels, binders and writing
instruments with brands such as Hi-Liters and Marks-A-Lot
markers. 3M abandoned a $550 million offer for the business last
year after the U.S. Justice Department opposed the deal because
of antitrust concerns.  A takeover would have given  St. Paul , Minnesota-based 3M
more than 80 percent of the U.S. market for labels and sticky
notes, the agency said.  The office product and label-converting divisions had
combined revenue of about $910 million in 2012, according to the
statement. CCL Industries’ purchase of the two units is the
largest deal in the company’s history, CEO Geoffrey Martin said.
CCL expects the transaction to close by mid-2013 and will add to
earnings in 2014.  Avery Dennison, based in Pasadena,  California ,  surged  6.1
percent to $38.33 at 9:54 a.m. New York time. CCL Industries
advanced 16 percent to $52.88.  Avery Dennison also reported fourth-quarter earnings today
that beat analysts’ estimates. Profit excluding certain items
was 54 cents a share, topping the 49-cent average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings in 2013 excluding restructuring costs and other
items will be $2.40 to $2.80 a share, the company said. Analysts
 projected  $2.40, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
