Treasury 10-year notes fell, with
yields touching the highest level in nine months, on speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will emphasize the need for continued
monetary stimulus at the conclusion of today’s policy meeting.  Government bonds briefly pared  losses  after a report showed
the  U.S. economy  unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter.
Gross domestic product was restrained by the biggest plunge in
defense spending in four decades and dwindling inventories as
household purchases picked up, the Commerce Department said. The
U.S. will auction $29 billion of seven-year securities, the last
of $99 billion of note sales this week.  “The  bond market  is holding ground, waiting for the Fed’s
report,”  Adrian Miller , director of fixed income strategies at
GMP Securities LLC in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“The big question is if they will hint at if and when they will
cut asset purchases. Until the report the market should stay
within this tight range.”  The 10-year  yield  rose 0.2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 2.02 percent at 10:27 a.m. New York time, after
touching 2.03 percent, the highest since April 25. The price of
the 1.625 percent notes due in November 2022 fell 5/32, or $1.56
per $1,000 face value, to 96 16/32, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader data.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s latest round of bond buying
will reach $1.14 trillion before he ends the program in the
first quarter of 2014, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Government Outlays  GDP, the volume of all goods and services produced, dropped
at a 0.1 percent annual rate, weaker than any economist forecast
in a Bloomberg survey and the worst performance since the second
quarter of 2009, when the world’s largest economy was still in
the recession. A drop in government outlays and smaller gain in
stockpiles cut a combined 2.6 percentage points from growth.  “It’s a surprise -- it’s weaker than expected and there
are aspects to it that need to be looked at,” said  David Ader ,
head of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It’s positive for the Treasury
market, relative to where we are, and there are lots of
caveats.”  Treasuries fell earlier as the U.S. added 192,000 workers
in January, data from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Research Institute showed today. The median forecast of 38
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of
165,000. Estimates ranged from gains of 120,000 to 235,000.  Term Premium  The 10-year term premium rose to minus 0.58 percent, the
highest level since April 5, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The measure dropped to a record minus 1.02 percent in
July.  A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  Policy makers said they may end their $85 billion monthly
bond purchases in 2013, with members divided between a mid- or
end-of-year finish, according to the record of the  Federal Open
Market Committee ’s Dec. 11-12 gathering.  Investor speculation that the Fed will end its third round
of quantitative easing in 2013 is overdone, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch economist  Michael Hanson  and strategist  Priya Misra  wrote in a research note yesterday. The statement from the
FOMC is likely to keep the central bank’s current policy stance
in place, they said.  ‘Trade Continues’  “Yields may rise a little bit higher while the risk-on
trade continues,” said Kazuaki Oh’e, a bond salesman in  Tokyo 
at CIBC World Markets Japan Inc., a unit of  Canada ’s fifth-
largest lender. “I don’t expect any large selloffs in
Treasuries, given that the Fed meeting will confirm it will
continue its bond-purchase program.”  The  seven-year notes  scheduled for sale today yielded 1.41
percent in pre-auction trading, up from 1.23 percent at the
previous sale of similar-maturity securities on Dec. 19. That
compares with a record-low auction yield of 0.954 percent on
July 26.  The U.S. sold $35 billion of five-year notes yesterday at a
yield of 0.889 percent, the highest since March. The bid-to-
cover  ratio , which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of notes offered, was 2.88 at auction, versus 2.72
last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
