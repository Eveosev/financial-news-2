The forint gained for a second day
after policy makers yesterday cautioned on the use of new
unconventional monetary policy measures as the central bank
prepares for a change of leadership.  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 295.19 per euro by
10:18 a.m. in Budapest, extending the advance in the past two
days to 1 percent. Yields on the government’s bonds maturing in
2016 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.71
percent.  Hungary ’s central bankers, who cut the main rate to 5.5
percent from 5.75 percent yesterday, said that expanding the
bank’s policy toolkit is only useful in “acute” turmoil,
according to a statement. The forint dropped 2.8 percent through
Jan. 28 after Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said last month
that the next governor, who takes over in March, should
“bravely use unorthodox tools” to help the economy recover
from its second recession in four years.  The Monetary Council’s comment on the rejection of
additional unconventional methods may help the forint advance in
the “coming days or weeks,” Zsolt Kondrat, a Budapest-based
analyst at Bayerische Landesbank’s MKB unit, wrote in a research
report today.  Matolcsy is the most likely successor to Andras Simor,
whose term as central bank president expires in March, according
to the Index and hvg.hu news websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
