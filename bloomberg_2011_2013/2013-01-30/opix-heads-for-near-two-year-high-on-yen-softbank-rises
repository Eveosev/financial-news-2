buy back shares. Central Japan Railway Co. gained 6.6 percent

increasing earnings going forward for the next few years,” said
 Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., which manages the equivalent of about 6
trillion yen ($66 billion). “The yen is positive, but there’s
also an increasingly better outlook for an economic recovery in
places like  China  as well as in Japan. There are a lot of
positive reasons why earnings should improve.”  Topix Rally  The Topix surged 29 percent from Nov. 14, when elections
were announced, on optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new
government will take the necessary steps to fight deflation. The
gauge is trading at 1.09 times  book value , compared with 2.08

its biggest advance since December 2008. The company reported a
49 percent jump in nine-month net income.  Softbank rose 3.6 percent to 3,175 yen. The carrier may
post a record operating profit as sales of the iPhone increased
and boosted mobile phone contracts, the Nikkei reported, without

June 2008. The company was among those lagging behind  Japan ’s
