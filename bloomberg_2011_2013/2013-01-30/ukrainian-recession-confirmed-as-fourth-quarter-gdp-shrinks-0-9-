Ukraine’s  economy  slipped into its
first recession since 2009, contracting for a second quarter as
exports including steel slid because of weak demand.  Seasonally adjusted gross domestic product fell a
preliminary 0.9 percent from the previous three months in the
fourth quarter after declining 1.2 percent in the July-September
period, the State Statistics Committee, based in the capital,
Kiev, said today on its  website . GDP dropped 2.7 percent from a
year earlier, missing the 1.8 percent median estimate of nine
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Representatives from the International Monetary Fund
arrived in Ukraine yesterday for talks over a third bailout in
four years as the former Soviet republic grapples with a
widening current-account gap, foreign reserves that have dipped
below three months of imports and $10 billion of debt payments
scheduled for this year. The government wants a loan of about
$15.4 billion and the same terms as its last  aid package .  The hryvnia has lost 0.9 percent against the dollar this
year, closing yesterday at 8.125. The cost to insure government
debt against non-payment for five years using credit-default
swaps has fallen to 575 basis points from 627 points on Dec. 31.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Industrial output fell for the first time since 2009 last
year, dropping 1.8 percent after a 7.6 percent jump in 2011 as
metals output plunged 5.2 percent, official data show.  Reserves declined to $24.5 billion in December from $38.2
billion in August 2011 as last year’s current-account gap
widened to a record $14.4 billion. Imports averaged $8.6 billion
a month in 2012, according to the central bank.  Ukraine’s economy will expand by 3 percent to 4 percent
this year, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov predicts. That’s more
optimistic than  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , which estimated Jan.
24 that GDP will contract 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
