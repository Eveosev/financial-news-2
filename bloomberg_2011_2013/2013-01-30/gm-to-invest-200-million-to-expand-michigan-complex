General Motors Co. (GM) , planning to
invest $1.5 billion in  North America  this year, today said it
would spend $200 million to expand a Michigan powertrain
complex.  The project includes construction of a new test wing at the
global engineering headquarters in Pontiac, GM said in a
statement today. The Detroit-based automaker is introducing
about 20 new vehicles in the U.S. this year to freshen its
product lineup, which has grown stale following the company’s
2009 bankruptcy reorganization.  Mark Reuss , president of GM North America, earlier this
month provided the $1.5 billion figure for the company’s 2013
North American investment plans. GM has announced more than
$10.2 billion since July 2009, Reuss said at the Automotive News
World Congress in Detroit.  The 138,000-square-foot (13,000-square-meter) wing is
scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2014.
Engineering work from leased offices in Wixom, Michigan;
Castleton, Indiana; and Torrance, California, will move to
Pontiac as part of the expansion plan, GM said.  “These moves will help our entire powertrain team work
more effectively across the organization,” Sam Winegarden, vice
president of global engine engineering, said in a statement. GM
will consolidate about 400 jobs in Pontiac.  GM also plans to relocate its propulsion systems research
lab in Warren,  Michigan , to Pontiac, the company said. GM had
previously announced plans to bring hydrogen fuel cell work to
Pontiac this year from Honeoye Falls,  New York .  GM announced Jan. 28 it plans to spend $600 million to
expand its Fairfax Assembly Plant in  Kansas City , Kansas, which
employs about 3,900 people and builds the Chevrolet Malibu and
Buick LaCrosse sedans.  GM fell 1.8 percent to $27.94 at the close in New York. The
shares have declined 3.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
