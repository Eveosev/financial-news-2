The U.K. announced a crackdown on
immigrants seeking to enter the country illegally by posing as
business people, after discovering a high volume of sham cases.  The so-called Tier One Entrepreneurs route into the U.K. is
designed to welcome those with access to no less than 200,000
pounds ($315,000) or venture capitalists with access to a
minimum of 50,000 pounds. U.K. Border Agency staff noticed
fraudsters were recycling funds to pass the immigration tests
and setting up artificial businesses.  “I am introducing a ‘genuine entrepreneur’ test which will
give U.K. Border Agency caseworkers the ability to test the
credibility of suspicious applicants,” Immigration Minister
Mark Harper said in a written statement to Parliament in  London 
today. “I am also making a further change to require the
necessary minimum funds to be held, or invested in the business,
on an ongoing basis rather than solely at the time of the
application.”  In the year through September 2012, 1,427 immigrants
entered the U.K. using the entrepreneur route and a further
1,129 had their visas extended once in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
