Thailand ’s baht rose for a second
day on optimism the nation’s improving economy and relatively
high bond yields will draw overseas capital.  The currency appreciated 2.7 percent this month, the best
exchange-rate performance in Asia, as international investors
poured more than $4 billion into local stocks and sovereign
bonds, official data show. The Bank of Thailand raised its 2013
growth forecast on Jan. 18 to 4.9 percent from an October
estimate of 4.6 percent. Benchmark 10-year government notes pay
3.71 percent in Thailand, compared with 2 percent in  the U.S. 
and 0.77 percent in  Japan .  “Investors have been pouring money into Asia where yields
are higher and economic conditions are solid, contributing to
appreciation pressures on currencies,” said Tohru Nishihama, an
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .
“Domestic demand in Thailand may lead to some inflationary
pressure and there’s speculation the central bank is a bit more
accommodative to currency gains to help curb inflation.”  The baht climbed 0.2 percent to 29.79 per dollar as of 8:24
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 29.66 on Jan. 21, the strongest since August 2011. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, dropped five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.42 percent.  Inflation accelerated to 3.63 percent in December, the
fastest in 13 months, government figures showed Jan. 2. Finance
Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said last week the central bank
should avoid fighting market forces to stem currency gains.  The yield on the 5.125 percent government bonds due March
2018 was little changed at 3.3 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
