Canadian average  weekly earnings  of
non-farm payroll employees rose 3.2 percent in November from a
year earlier, led by a 6.6 percent gain for construction
workers.  On a monthly basis, earnings rose 0.5 percent to C$910.77
($909.13), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The average
workweek rose to 33.2 hours in November from 33.1 hours in
October and 32.9 hours a year earlier.  The 12-month wage increase exceeded the Bank of Canada’s 2
percent inflation target for the seventh consecutive month.
Consumer prices advanced at year-over-year rates of 0.8 percent
in November and December.  Payroll employment rose by 3,100 in November to 15.28
million, little changed on a percentage basis and up 1.5 percent
from a year earlier.  Statistics Canada’s main  employment report , the labor force
survey of households, reported job gains of 59,300 in November
and 39,800 in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
