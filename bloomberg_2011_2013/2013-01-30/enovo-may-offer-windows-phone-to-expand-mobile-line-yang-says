Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the world’s
second-largest personal computer maker, may offer smartphones
running  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows Phone 8 operating system to
expand its range of handsets beyond  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android.  “We will assess whether we should launch Windows Phone,”
Lenovo Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing said in a phone
interview yesterday. “We have a very good relationship with
Microsoft. If the market and customers can accept Windows Phone,
we will provide the product to them.”  Lenovo yesterday said it boosted  sales  of mobile devices
such as smartphones and tablets by 77 percent to $998 million
last quarter. The company shipped 9 million smartphones,
allowing its phone unit to turn a profit for the first time.
Handsets will continue to have profitable growth in China, Yang
said.  The company, which only introduced smartphones in 2010,
last year became the second-largest supplier in China behind
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  Overtaking Samsung for the top spot in
China is “definitely our aspiration,” Yang said.  The push into smartphones helped Lenovo report a 34 percent
jump in fiscal third-quarter profit to $204.9 million.  Lenovo, which has its headquarters in Beijing and its main
U.S. office in Morrisville, North Carolina, fell 2.7 percent to
close at HK$8.30 in Hong Kong  trading , before the announcement.
It has climbed 18 percent this month, surpassing the 5.1 percent
gain for the city’s  Hang Seng Index .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
