Metinvest, Ukraine’s biggest
steelmaker, said it repaid $75 million of a pre-export facility
and $40 million of a loan.  The pre-export facility was given to Metinvest in January
of 2011 by Rabobank International, the company, based in the
eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, said today in an e-mailed
statement. The two-year loan had an annual interest margin of 3
percent in addition to Libor, or London Interbank offered rate,
according to the statement.  Metinvest secured the three-year $40 million loan from
Amsterdam Trade Bank NV in March 2010 for “general corporate
purposes.” It had an annual interest margin of 6 percent in
addition to Libor and was repaid ahead of schedule, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
