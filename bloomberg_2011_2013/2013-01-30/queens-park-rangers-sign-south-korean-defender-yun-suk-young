Queens Park Rangers, the bottom team
in England’s Premier League, said it signed defender Yun Suk
Young from South Korea’s Chunnam Dragons on a three-and-a-half
year contract.  South Korea international Yun has been granted a work
permit and will be eligible to play for QPR when he gets a visa.
The transfer fee wasn’t disclosed.  Yun, 22, joins compatriot Park Ji Sung at Loftus Road. The
club has also recruited striker Loic Remy and defender Tal Ben Haim in the January transfer window.  Christopher Samba  may also join from Russia’s Anzhi
Makhachkala after QPR triggered a release clause in the
defender’s contract, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  The west London team has offered 10 million pounds ($15.8
million) for Samba, 28, the BBC said. The Congolese
international has also played for Hertha Berlin and Blackburn.  QPR, which drew 0-0 with champion Manchester City last
night, needs defensive reinforcements as Ryan Nelsen is set to
take up a coaching role with Toronto of Major League Soccer.
Anton Ferdinand has been loaned to Bursaspor in Turkey.  Manager  Harry Redknapp  is also keen to sign Stoke striker
 Peter Crouch , who previously played for QPR, the BBC added. The
London team’s midfielder Alejandro Faurlin will join Italy’s
Palermo on loan until the end of the season,  Sky Sports 
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
