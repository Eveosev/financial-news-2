The number of Capesize ships
reported as hired to ship  iron ore  in January to  China , the
biggest importer, fell 57 percent from the prior month,
underpinning a slump in earnings, DNB Bank ASA said.  The slide in vessel bookings, especially from the biggest
 iron ore  exporter, Brazil, led a 61 percent fall in ton mile
demand this month, a measurement of volumes carried by distances
traveled, according to the Oslo-based bank. The capacity of
Capesize ships hired totaled 6.3 million deadweight tons, versus
14.8 million tons in December, according to DNB, citing a list
published by Clarkson Plc, the biggest shipbroker. Not all
bookings are reported to the market.  Average rates for Capesize vessels, comprising 40 percent
of the global bulk carrier fleet, are 51 percent lower than
December’s high of $15,532 a day, according to the London-based
Baltic Exchange, which publishes freight costs.  Brazil ’s share of bookings averaged 25 percent in the final
quarter of 2012, versus 13 percent in January, according to DNB,
adding ton-mile demand also fell by 59 percent in January 2012
from the prior month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
