Romania, the European Union’s
second-poorest member, has taken steps to address “serious
concerns” about eroding democracy and needs to increase the
pace of reforms to keep the judiciary independent, the EU said.  The coalition government, supported by a super majority in
Parliament, has made progress in dealing with “challenges to
the country’s constitutional order,” though it’s yet to appoint
a new chief prosecutor and anti-corruption head, European
Commission spokesman  Mark Gray  said today in Brussels.  Romania, which joined the EU in 2007, is being monitored by
the commission since a power struggle between Prime Minister
Victor Ponta and President Traian Basescu last year raised
concerns that democracy is backsliding in the former communist
country. The nation has since reversed  Constitutional Court 
power-limiting laws and appointed a new Ombudsman to meet
pledges to the EU.  “It has been a difficult year and I think the commission
sees this report more as a signal of encouragement that we
should no longer see this sort of” political turmoil, Gray
said. “Progress has been made” and “we hope that 2013 will
see a more stable political environment and the delivery of all
those recommendations.”  The commission will release a new report on  Romania ’s
progress under the mechanism by the end of this year, Gray said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
