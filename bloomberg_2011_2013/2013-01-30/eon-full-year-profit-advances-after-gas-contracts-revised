EON SE,  Germany ’s biggest utility,
reported higher earnings after renegotiating gas contracts with
OAO Gazprom and said asset sales will exceed an earlier target.  Adjusted net income, which EON uses to calculate its
dividend, rose to 4.3 billion euros in 2012 from 2.5 billion
euros in 2011. That compared with the 4.15 billion-euro median
estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. EON estimates
earnings on this basis will drop to 2.2 billion to 2.6 billion
euros for 2013.  “We could come toward 20 billion euros” of asset sales,
Chief Executive Officer Johannes Teyssen said today on a
conference call. EON has completed about 17 billion euros of
disposals to date, from an initial target of 15 billion euros.  European utilities are struggling to cope with weaker
demand and a slower economic outlook at the same time Germany
plans to exit nuclear energy by 2022. EON, which scrapped
previous profit forecasts for 2013, plans to reduce  capital
spending  and is selling assets to cut costs. The utility is also
studying whether to close unprofitable power plants.  EON said it will shut 11,000 megawatts of power generation
in  Europe  by 2015, with a focus on coal-fired plants.  Shares decline  The  shares  fell 0.8 percent to 13.22 euros as of the close
in  Frankfurt  after initially climbing as much as 4 percent. The
stock lost 15 percent last year for the worst performance in
Germany’s benchmark DAX Index.  EON will return to a payout ratio of 50 percent to 60
percent of adjusted earnings and will no longer have an absolute
dividend target in future, the Dusseldorf-based company said
today. It confirmed a payout of 1.10 euro a share for last year.  “It will come down to a significant dividend cut for
2013,” said Sven Diermeier, an analyst at Independent Research
GmbH in Frankfurt. “The dividend will even be below the level
of 2011.”  The utility is targeting 1.3 billion euros of cost savings
from 2011 to 2015 as well as positive free  cash flow  until 2015.
Planned capital spending of 6 billion euros in 2013 will be
reduced to 4 billion to 4.5 billion euros in 2015, the CEO said.  Gazprom,  Russia ’s gas-export monopoly, agreed to amend
long-term supply deals for EON after the utility lost hundreds
of millions of euros on contracts linked to  oil prices .  The German utility had previously scrapped profit forecasts
for this year after saying the shift to renewable energy
presented “huge challenges.” The estimate for 2013 adjusted
earnings compared with an earlier forecast of 3.2 billion to 3.7
billion euros.  EON said in November that it pulled the initial targets
because of the “substantial economic uncertainties and
structural changes” in the  energy industry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
