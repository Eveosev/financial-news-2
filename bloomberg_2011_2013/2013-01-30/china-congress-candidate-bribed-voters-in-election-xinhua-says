A candidate for a provincial
legislature in southern China’s  Hunan province  said he gave out
about 320,000 yuan ($51,435) in bribes to voters in a failed bid
to win a seat, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  Huang Yubiao, 64, a businessman, said in an online posting
that he had handed out about 320 envelopes containing 1,000 yuan
each to voters, saying he was encouraged to do so by an official
in the city of Shaoyang, Xinhua reported. Huang said other
candidates for the legislature won by giving bribes, according
to the Xinhua report.  Hunan province set up a team to probe Huang’s claims,
Xinhua said. Huang is chairman of a private building material
company in neighboring Guangdong province, it reported.  China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress, as
well as the provincial People’s Congresses, have attracted some
of China’s richest people, who can use the venues to forge
business ties. The wealthiest 70 members of China’s National
People’s Congress had a net worth of 565.8 billion  yuan  in 2011,
more than 10 times the wealth of all members of the  U.S.
Congress , the president and his Cabinet, and the Supreme Court,
