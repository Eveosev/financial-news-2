Wenger SA, a manufacturer of Swiss
army knives since 1893, will stop making them, the company’s
owner and former rival Victorinox AG said today.  Victorinox, founded in 1884 in the central Swiss town of
Ibach, bought Wenger SA in 2005, saving its biggest competitor
from bankruptcy. Until now, Victorinox had continued selling the
folding knives under both names.  “With this decision we can assign a specific brand to the
heritage of the Swiss army knife,” Victorinox said today in an
e-mailed  statement . “Uniting the two ranges will allow us
better to exploit the market’s potential for growth.”  Sales of the gadgets, which Victorinox still supplies
exclusively to the Swiss military, plummeted by a third after
the 2001 terror attacks prompted tougher security checks for
travelers. The business was hit again in 2003 when the army
reduced personnel.  The  Defense Ministry ’s 2008 ban on foreign bids to supply
soldiers’ knives helped a recovery, while Victorinox,  Europe ’s
biggest cutlery maker according to its website, also sells
products including luxury watches and camping gear.  Victorinox will continue to market some products under the
Wenger name and will not cut any jobs, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
