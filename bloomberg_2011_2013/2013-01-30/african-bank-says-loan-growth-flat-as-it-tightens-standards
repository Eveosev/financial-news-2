African Bank Investments Ltd. (ABL) ,  South
Africa ’s largest provider of unsecured loans, said lending
slowed for the first time since a 2009 recession as it tightened
standards amid rising consumer debt.  Total credit disbursements for the fiscal first quarter
ended Dec. 31 were “flat” at 7.43 billion rand ($823 million)
from a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based  lender  said in a
statement today. African Bank tightened lending standards even
amid “a slowdown in customers’ appetite and capacity for
credit,” with loan applications falling 7 percent, it said.  South Africa’s unsecured lending market, which grew faster
than any other type of credit in the past two years, started to
slow in the third quarter of last year, according to the
National Credit Regulator. Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  and
the banking regulator had signaled concern that loan growth
could lead to a bubble without any measures taken.  The lender  rose  1.3 percent to 31.8 rand in Johannesburg
trading today.  South Africa’s economic growth has slowed and “this,
together with the growth in the supply of credit over the past
few years, will continue to exert pressure on customers,”
African Bank said. “The group continues to maintain a strong
capital and liquidity position and will look to further
diversify its sources of cost-effective funding.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
