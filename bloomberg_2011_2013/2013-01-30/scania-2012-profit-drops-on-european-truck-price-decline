Scania AB (SCVA) , the Swedish truckmaker
controlled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said profit dropped 29 percent in
2012 because of pricing pressure and lower production rates amid
an economic decline in its main market of Europe.  Net income fell to 6.65 billion kronor ($1.04 billion) from
9.42 billion kronor a year earlier, Soedertaelje, Sweden-based
Scania said today in a  statement . Revenue declined 9.2 percent
to 79.6 billion kronor.  “Customers are hesitant about investing in new vehicles in
view of the uncertain economic climate,” Chief Executive
Officer Martin Lundstedt said in the statement. At the same
time, truck and bus orders rose 24 percent in the fourth quarter
amid a “replacement need,” while new emissions standards may
also add to demand, he said.  Europe  accounted for 45 percent of Scania’s truck
deliveries last year, an increase from 44 percent in 2011. The
economy of the 17 nations sharing the euro went into recession
in the third quarter, and the European Central Bank is
forecasting a 0.3 percent contraction in 2013. Scania said it
has reduced first-quarter production in Europe by 15 percent
from the previous three-month period because of declining sales.  Scania  fell  as much as 3.3 percent and was trading down 0.1
percent at 137.9 kronor as of 10:02 a.m. in Stockholm. That
pared the shares’ gain in the past 12 months to 18 percent.  Capacity Plans  The manufacturer plans to increase annual production
capacity to 120,000 trucks and buses by 2015 from 100,000
vehicles in 2012, according to a year-old plan that Lundstedt
reiterated on Sept. 26. Under that strategy, Scania’s capacity
would rise to 150,000 commercial vehicles at the next peak of
the business cycle.  Demand for commercial vehicles in December fell to the
lowest level since October 2009 in Europe, industry association
ACEA  said  yesterday. Registrations of new heavy trucks in Europe
declined in all major markets, plunging 16 percent in  France , 20
percent in  Italy , 21 percent in the U.K., 27 percent in  Germany 
and almost 40 percent in Spain.  Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, wants to forge a
European truck alliance between Scania and its second truck
unit, Munich-based  MAN SE (MAN) , to reap cost savings and take on
global market leader  Daimler AG. (DAI)  Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW
owns 75.03 percent of MAN and said Jan. 9 that it plans to make
an offer for full control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
