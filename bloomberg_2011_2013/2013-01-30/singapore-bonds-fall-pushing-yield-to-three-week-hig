Singapore  bonds fell, pushing 10-
year yields to the highest level in three weeks, as debt tumbled
globally on signs of economic improvement.  Government securities  in the island-state have handed
investors a 0.7 percent loss in January, versus a 0.5 percent
decline for sovereign bonds around the world, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields
are near the highest since April. The U.S. and Singapore are
both scheduled to issue jobs reports this week.  “The move in Singapore bond yields is just a response to
higher yields in the U.S.,” said Thio Chin Loo, a senior
currency analyst at BNP Paribas SA in Singapore. “There’s
probably some positioning adjustment ahead of U.S. data.”  Singapore’s 3.125 percent bond due in September 2022 fell
to S$115.10 as of 3:29 p.m. local time from S$115.60 yesterday.
The yield increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
points, to 1.43 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was the highest level since Jan. 4, based on  data 
from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  The  European Central Bank  said this month lenders will
repay more of its loans than forecast, spurring optimism the
worst of the region’s debt crisis is over.  The U.S. jobless rate probably held at 7.8 percent in
January, matching the lowest level since January 2009, based on
a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the Labor
Department reports the figure Feb. 1.  Singapore’s  unemployment rate  was probably 2 percent in the
fourth quarter, based on responses from economists before the
report tomorrow. It was 1.9 percent in the prior quarter, the
least since the first three months of 2011.  The local currency slipped 0.1 percent to S$1.2347 per  U.S.
dollar . The Straits Times Index of shares added 0.6 percent to
3,279.78, set for the highest close since November 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
