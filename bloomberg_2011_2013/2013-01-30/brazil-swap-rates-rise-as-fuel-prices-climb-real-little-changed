Brazil ’s swap rates rose as the
state oil company said it would increase fuel prices and a
report showed inflation was higher than forecast, increasing
pressure on policy makers to lift borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 increased
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.90 percent at
10:20 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real was little changed at 1.9842
per dollar after rallying beyond 2 on Jan. 28 for the first time
in almost seven months as the central bank intervened to boost
the currency and contain inflation.  “The gasoline prices increase inflation worries even with
the real appreciating,” Ures Folchini, the head of fixed income
at Banco WestLB do Brasil, said by phone from  Sao Paulo .  Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, said in a regulatory filing that it will increase
gasoline prices at refineries by 6.6 percent and diesel by 5.4
percent. The company also said it is seeking to eliminate the
discount between domestic and international prices.  The IGP-M inflation  index  rose 0.34 percent in the month
through Jan. 20, the Getulio Vargas Foundation reported. The
median forecast of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
0.32 percent increase. The gauge is composed of 60 percent
producer prices, 30 percent consumer prices and 10 percent
construction costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
