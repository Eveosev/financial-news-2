Bahrain Petroleum Co. will ask  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ’s advice on raising at least $6
billion to increase its output, according to a banker familiar
with the deal.  The banker asked not to be identified because the
information is private and provided no further information. A
spokesman for Bahrain Petroleum and a spokeswoman for BNP
Paribas in Manama, Bahrain, declined to comment. HSBC did not
respond to a phone call seeking comment.  Bapco, as the company is known, plans to spend $6 billion
to $10 billion on expansion works that will increase daily
production capacity at its only refinery to more than 450,000
barrels, from about 267,000 barrels now, the nation’s oil
minister Abdul Hussain Mirza said in May last year. The work on
the refinery should be completed by 2018, he said.  “The refinery’s plans are on schedule and I don’t see any
changes to them at the moment,” Bapco Chairman Adel Almoayyed
said by phone today.  Bahrain, which began pumping oil in the 1930s, is the
smallest crude producer in the Gulf. It depends on Saudi Arabia,
the world’s largest oil exporter, to supply it with 150,000
barrels a day of crude pumped from a shared oil field and
delivered to Bahrain by pipeline to the refinery. The nation
plans to raise the pipeline capacity by 120,000 barrels a day to
350,000 barrels in 2014, according to Mirza.  The front-end engineering and design of the pipeline
expansion expansion should be completed in June and the works on
the project should start in the second half, Khalid Sabbagh,
general manager of marketing at Bapco said today by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
