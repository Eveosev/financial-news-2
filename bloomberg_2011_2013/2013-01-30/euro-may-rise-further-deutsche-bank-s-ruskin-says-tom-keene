The euro may strengthen further
against the dollar as the region’s economy exceeds forecasts,
said  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York.  “The economic data in Europe has been improving rapidly,”
Ruskin said on  Bloomberg Radio ’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “The surprise indexes are much higher in Europe than in
the U.S.”  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro region rose to 89.2 from a revised 87.8 in December,
the European Commission in Brussels said today. That’s the
highest since June. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast an increase to 88.2.  The euro zone’s Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, a
measurement of actual economics news versus a previous Bloomberg
survey median, rose to 63.6 last week, the highest in almost
since February 2011.  The 17-nation euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.3553 per euro
at 9:45 a.m. New York time and topped $1.35 for first time since
December 2011. The 17-nation shared currency has strengthened
2.8 percent against the dollar this month.  “If people are going to throw in the towel around $1.38,
it’s too late,” Ruskin said. “It’s hard for the euro to soar
above $1.40.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
