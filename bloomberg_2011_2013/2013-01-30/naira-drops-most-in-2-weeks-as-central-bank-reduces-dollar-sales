Nigeria’s naira dropped the most in
two weeks after the central bank reduced dollar supply at an
auction today.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer weakened 0.3
percent to 157:38 a dollar as of 3 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial
capital, the most on a closing basis since Dec. 15, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold $120 million at a foreign
currency auction today, the lowest in three auctions, the Abuja-
based bank said in a statement on its website. The regulator,
which sells dollars on Mondays and Wednesdays to stabilise the
local currency, is the major supplier of the currency.  “The naira is depressed by the small volume of dollars
offered by the central bank,” Abubakar Mohammed, chief
executive of Lagos-based Forward Marketing Bureau de Change
Ltd., said in a telephone interview. “The naira may regain
support later in the week from oil company sales.”  Oil companies, which sell dollars to lenders by the month-
end to meet local spending needs, are the second-biggest source
of foreign currency.  The central Bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged
for the eighth time on Jan. 21 to stabilize the naira. The
 inflation rate  in December eased to 12 percent, from 12.3
percent in the previous month, as the effects of flooding that
damaged agricultural output last year began to subside.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 fell nine basis points to 11.21 percent in the
secondary market, according to yesterday’s data on the  Financial
Markets Dealers Association  website.  The yield on $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021
rose four basis points to 3.876 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.9010 a dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
