LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA
named Pierre Gode deputy chairman of its Italian operations
after the 68-year-old stepped down as chief executive officer of

LVMH’s French and Italian businesses, Paris-based LVMH said
today in a statement. He will retain his roles of LVMH deputy
chairman, director and executive committee member, and will
continue as a director of  Christian Dior SA (CDI) , LVMH said.  Gode stepped down as CEO of Arnault’s investment companies

estimated net worth of $30 billion, according to the Bloomberg
