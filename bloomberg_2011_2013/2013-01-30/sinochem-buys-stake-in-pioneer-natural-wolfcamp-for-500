Sinochem Group , China’s biggest
supplier of chemical products, agreed to buy a 40 percent stake
in Texas oil-shale acreage from  Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD) 
for $500 million.  Sinochem also will pay $1.2 billion of Pioneer Natural’s
share of future drilling costs, the Dallas-based company said in
a statement yesterday. Pioneer Natural will continue to operate
the 207,000 net acres in the Wolfcamp. The acquisition is
Beijing-based Sinochem’s first oil and natural gas purchase from
a U.S. company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sinochem’s move follows other deals in which a Chinese
buyer gets a stake in U.S. shale formations in exchange for
funding drilling costs.  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  agreed to pay as much as $1.3
billion including drilling costs for an interest in Chesapeake
Energy Corp.’s Niobrara shale project in 2011.  China 
Petrochemical Corp. and Devon Energy Corp. agreed to a deal
valued at as much as $2.5 billion last year.  “This accelerated development will add significant
production and reserves for Pioneer while enhancing shareholder
value,” Scott Sheffield, chairman and chief executive officer
of Pioneer Natural, said in the statement. Pioneer Natural is
also halting efforts to sell properties in the Barnett Shale
because of low bids, the company said in a separate statement.  The companies plan to drill 86 horizontal wells in the
Wolfcamp this year, increasing to 120 next year and 165 in 2015.  Pioneer Natural fell 1 percent to $116.21 at the close in
New York yesterday. The shares have gained 9 percent this month.  Largest Holder  Pioneer is the largest acreage holder in the Wolfcamp, with
more than 400,000 acres, according to its website. Its first two
wells in the area produce about 75 percent oil, 20 percent
natural gas liquids and 5 percent gas. The company had planned
to drill 90 horizontal wells in the area by the end of 2013.  Hu Hongjun, Sinochem’s Beijing-based media relations
official, confirmed the acquisition and said the group will
issue a statement later today.  In the past 12 months, Chinese companies have announced
acquisitions valued at $17.9 billion for North American oil and
gas companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chinese
interest in shale, a dense rock formation that holds oil and
gas, comes as the nation seeks the technology to unlock its own
reserves.  China holds 25.1 trillion cubic meters of exploitable shale
reserves, the country’s Ministry of Land and Resources said
March 1, citing a nationwide survey.  Bank of America Corp. Merrill Lynch served as Pioneer’s
financial adviser and Vinson & Elkins LLP was its legal adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
