Parliamentary Speaker  Ali Larijani 
said his nation does not consider direct negotiations with the
U.S. as a “red line,” the state-run  Al-Alam  news channel
reported.  “Political developments that have taken place in the U.S.
may lead to a new direction,” Larijani said in an interview
posted on the television channel’s website’s yesterday. “We can
comment on the U.S actions and we need to see what steps U.S.
authorities will be taking.”  “On whether negotiations with the U.S. is a red line for
 Iran , no we never said this,” Larijani said after being asked
whether talks between the two countries may take place during
President  Barack Obama ’s second term, according to Al-Alam.  Iran and U.S. have had no diplomatic ties in over three
decades and are at loggerheads over the Persian Gulf nation’s
nuclear program, which the U.S. administration and its allies
say may conceal the development of atomic weapons. Iranian
authorities have rejected the charge and say their nuclear
program is civilian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
