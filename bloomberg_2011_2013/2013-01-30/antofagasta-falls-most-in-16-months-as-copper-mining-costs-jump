Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper company
controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, fell the most in 16 months
in London trading after forecasting increased costs this year.  Antofagasta slid as much as 8.5 percent, the biggest drop
since Sept. 22, 2011. It said in a statement the cost to mine a
pound of copper would increase 14 percent to 185 cents in 2013.  Costs are “significantly higher than what consensus was
expecting,” Liberum Capital Ltd. said in a note to investors.  The industry has been beset by surging costs for energy,
labor and construction materials. Antofagasta said rising energy
prices would add to costs at its Los Pelambres mine, along with
“increased mine movement” at the company’s Esperanza site.  Antofagasta will produce 700,000 metric tons of copper and
260,000 ounces of gold this year, compared with 709,600 tons and
299,900 ounces, respectively, in 2012. The company traded down
7.8 percent at 1,176 pence as of 12:57 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
