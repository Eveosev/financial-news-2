The number of  California  homes that sold for at least $1 million reached a five-year high in 2012, fueled by a recovering economy and a record number of cash purchases, DataQuick said today.  A total of 26,993 homes sold for at least $1 million last year, up 27 percent from 21,267 in 2011, the San Diego-based data provider said in a statement. It was the most since 2007, when 42,502 homes crossed the threshold, DataQuick said.  High-end sales were buoyed by a record number of cash purchases, according to DataQuick. Last year, 7,791 buyers of million-dollar homes paid in cash, up from 5,802 in 2011. In areas such as  Santa Monica , Ross in Marin County and  Los Altos  in Santa Clara County, “virtually all home sales” were for $1 million or more, the firm said.  “Buyers and sellers in the prestige market tend to respond to different motivations and incentives than the rest of the market,”  John Walsh , DataQuick’s president, said in the statement. “ Job security , down-payment sizes and mortgage interest rates don’t play the same role. Returns on investments in a low-interest-rate financial environment and safe-haven investing do play a role.”  The number of California homes sold for more than $5 million rose to a record last year, climbing to 697 from 491 in 2011, DataQuick said. In the $4 million-to-$5 million range, a record 460 homes sold, up from 344 in 2011.  The most expensive confirmed purchase last year in California was an 8,930-square-foot (830-square-meter) Woodside home with four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. It sold for $117.5 million in November, DataQuick said.
