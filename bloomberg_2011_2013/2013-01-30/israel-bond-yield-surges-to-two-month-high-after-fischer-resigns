Israel ’s benchmark government bond
yield surged to the highest level in two months after Bank of
Israel Governor Stanley Fischer, who has reduced interest rates
since 2011, said he will step down in June.  The yield on the 4.25 percent Mimshal Shiklit maturing
March 2023 increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 4.14 percent, the highest level since Nov. 25, at
11:18 a.m. in Tel Aviv. The yield jumped eight basis points
after the announcement yesterday. The shekel was little changed
today, while the benchmark  TA-25 index  gained 0.1 percent.  Fischer, governor since 2005, said he will leave in the
middle of his second term. The central bank left its benchmark
interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent on Jan. 28 after a
surprise cut the previous month that brought the rate to the
lowest in more than two years. The regulator has gradually
reduced the borrowing rate from 3.25 percent in 2011 to shore up
the economy amid the  European debt crisis .  The market reaction is “mainly due to the fear that the
accommodative monetary policy, held during Fischer’s term will
be changed,” Modi Shafrir, chief economist at Tel-Aviv-based
I.L.S. Brokers, wrote in an e-mailed note yesterday. “One
should still remember that since November 2011 the local rate
decision is conducted by the Monetary Policy Committee and it
seems that the majority of members still hold a relatively
dovish attitude.”  Budget Deficit  Fischer said at a press conference this morning in
 Jerusalem  that one of his primary goals was passing a new Bank
of Israel law that established a monetary committee to set
interest rates, rather than relying only on the governor. His
resignation came a week after voters gave Benjamin Netanyahu the
chance to serve a third term as prime minister with a weaker
mandate than four years ago.  The central banker said last year that it was a priority
for the next government to reduce the budget deficit. Israel
posted a gap of 39 billion shekels ($10.5 billion) for 2012, or
4.2 percent of gross domestic product, the Finance Ministry said
on Jan. 13.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, lost 0.2 percent to 281.21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
