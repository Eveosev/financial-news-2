Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest
camera maker, forecast profit will rise 14 percent this year
amid a weaker yen and the withering of a boycott of Japanese
goods in China.  Net income  will probably be 255 billion yen ($2.8 billion)
in the 12 months ending Dec. 31, the Tokyo-based company said in
a statement today. That compares with the 286.3 billion-yen
 average  of 21 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The yen’s decline to the lowest in about 2 1/2 years is
helping Canon boost profit even as consumers increasingly use
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Samsung Electronics Co. smartphones to take
snapshots. The maker of EOS cameras may also see a rebound in
 China  sales after the end of an anti-Japanese boycott that
disrupted business in the quarter ended December.  “The China slowdown was probably temporary, and we can
expect that sales will recover,” Kunihiko Kanno, a Tokyo-based
analyst at BNP Paribas SA, said before the earnings
announcement. “Canon can also probably cut prices while the yen
is weak to stimulate demand.”  Global shipments of digital cameras fell 14 percent in
value in November from the previous month, according to the
 Camera & Imaging Products Association  in Tokyo. Shipments of
high-end models with interchangeable lenses recorded a 12
percent decline. That followed a 6.6 percent gain in October,
according to the industry group.  Canon, which also makes fax machines and printers, rose 2.9
percent to close at 3,385 yen in  Tokyo  trading before the
announcement. The shares have dropped 1.5 percent in the past 12
months, compared with a 26 percent gain for  Japan ’s benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Sales may rise 9.5 percent to 3.8 trillion yen, Canon said.
That compares with the 3.7 trillion-yen average of analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Operating profit, or sales
minus the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses, will
probably gain 27 percent to 410 billion yen, the company said.
Analysts had expected 442 billion yen.  Canon has said it will pay a 60 yen year-end  dividend  for
2012, along with a 10-yen bonus to mark its 75-year anniversary.
It paid out 60 yen a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
