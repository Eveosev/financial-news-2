China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. (762) , the
nation’s second-largest mobile-phone company, said 2012 net
income probably increased more than 50 percent from a year
earlier as it expanded its 3G and broadband user base.  Those trends fueled a revenue increase that outpaced costs
and expenses, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing
yesterday. While China Unicom didn’t provide numbers, it plans
to release detailed earnings in March.  China Unicom’s 2012 net income probably rose to 7.1 billion
 yuan  ($1.1 billion) from 4.23 billion yuan in 2011, according to
the average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Third-
quarter net income of 2.02 billion yuan missed the 2.21 billion
yuan median estimate because of the push to add users with
lower-cost mobile phones.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chang Xiaobing turned
to low-cost smartphones priced at 1,000 yuan or less, like the
V889M from  ZTE Corp. (000063) , after the company in March lost the
advantage of being the only Chinese carrier to offer  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone with a service plan. Subscribers with cheaper
phones make less use of data.  The company published its statement after the Hong Kong
stock market closed. The stock gained 1 percent to HK$12.26
yesterday. The shares have declined 14 percent in the past 12
months, compared with a gain of about 18 percent in the city’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
