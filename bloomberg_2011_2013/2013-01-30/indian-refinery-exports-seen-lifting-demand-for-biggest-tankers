Demand for the biggest tankers
hauling oil products will gain 15 percent this year as shipments
advance on the longest trade routes to the U.S. from  India  and
to  Asia  from the  Middle East , said  Clarkson (CKN)  Plc.  Demand for so-called Long Range Two tankers that ship as
much as 90,000 metric tons of cargoes including jet fuel and
gasoline will rise to 33.3 million deadweight tons of capacity
this year from 28.9 million tons in 2012, the world’s largest
shipbroker said in a monthly report published on its website
today. Demand for Long-Range One tankers, carrying as much as
60,000 tons, will expand 15 percent to 15.4 million tons.  “The increases in volumes on long-haul trades from the
Middle East Gulf to the  Far East  and from India to the U.S. are
projected to boost demand in these sectors,” the London-based
shipbroker said. Demand for vessels carrying as much as 47,000
tons of cargo will contract 4.6 percent to 50.8 million tons, it
estimated.  Earnings for product tankers will recover this year as
refined oils are carried over longer distances and fleet growth
stagnates, Evercore LLP, the  New York  investment bank said in a
Jan. 17 report as it upgraded rates estimates for the ships.  Long Range tankers reported as booked to haul refined oil
products from India to the U.S. climbed to 68 in 2012, from 48
the prior year, data from shipbrokers compiled by Bloomberg
show. In 2010, 12 were booked on the same route, the data show.
Not all bookings are reported to the market.  Total demand for the world’s 2,173 product tankers will
rise 4.2 percent to 99.5 million deadweight tons in 2013, while
the fleet will expand 3.6 percent to 117.1 million tons,
Clarkson estimated. There are 242 Long Range Two product tankers
and 318 Long Range One vessels, less than half the fleet of
1,281 so-called Medium Range tankers, the most frequently used
for refined-oil transport, according to the shipbroker.  Seaborne product shipments totaled 823.9 million tons in
2011 and are projected to rise to 902 million tons by 2015, the
research division of  DVB Bank SE (DVB) , a German transport lender,
said in a report in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
