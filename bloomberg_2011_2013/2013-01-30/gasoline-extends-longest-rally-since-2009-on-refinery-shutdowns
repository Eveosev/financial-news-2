Gasoline extended the longest rally
since July 2009 on speculation that refinery repairs and a
pending plant closing will reduce East Coast stockpiles that are
the lowest seasonally since 2004.  Futures rose a 10th straight day as  gasoline  supply in PADD
1 was 10 percent below the five-year average last week,
government data show.  Hess Corp. (HES)  will shut its New Jersey plant
in February. Philadelphia-area refineries that supply  New York 
Harbor have units down for repairs. The gasoline crack spread on
Nymex jumped to the highest level since October.  “The market is running scared here,” said  Stephen Schork ,
president of the Schork Group Inc., an energy advisory company
in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “We have ongoing refinery outages,
we’re going into turnarounds and we’ve all got an eye ahead on
Memorial Day. Where is this supply to come from?”  Gasoline for February delivery climbed 6.53 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $3.0387 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was the biggest gain since Dec. 26 and highest
settlement since Sept. 28.  Prices are up 8.1 percent this month and have advanced 12
percent since Jan. 15, making gasoline the top performer on the
Standard & Poor’s  GSCI commodity index  during that period. The
contract is for reformulated gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or RBOB.  Volume was 41 percent above the 100-day average at 3:03
p.m. The more actively traded March gasoline increased 5.69
cents to $3.0332. February gasoline and heating oil contracts
will expire at the end of floor trading tomorrow.  Backwardated Market  February futures were at a 0.55 cent premium to March
contracts, the first time since Jan. 3 that the spread has been
in backwardation, indicating lower supplies or higher demand.
Prices extended gains after the U.S. Energy Information
Administration’s weekly inventory report.  “All of this is anxiety over the future,” said  Tim Evans ,
an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.
“Look at how February has performed. That’s a function of
short-covering in the paper market and suggests a bit of
hysteria.”  The March gasoline crack spread versus West Texas
Intermediate widened $2.01 to $29.45 a barrel, and gained $1.84
to $12.49 against  Brent crude  on ICE Futures  Europe .  “There’s a potential short squeeze in RBOB ahead of
expiration, the Port Reading news and today, although PADD 1
inventories built, gasoline drew counter-seasonally and the PADD
1 build was less than the increase in imports,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a
research consulting company in  London .  Gasoline Inventories  Total U.S.  gasoline inventories  fell 956,000 barrels to
232.3 million barrels in the seven days ended Jan. 25, according
to EIA data. The median of analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was for an increase of 1 million barrels. Supplies in
PADD 1 increased 1.24 million barrels to 55.2 million as imports
to the region rose 47 percent to 609,000 barrels a day, the most
since the week ended Sept. 7.  Refineries processed 1.06 million barrels a day of crude
and other feedstocks, down 2.1 percent from a week earlier.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions will shut the Girard Point
section of its plant, the largest near the New York trading hub,
this month for 60 days of work. A fluid catalytic cracker at
 Delta Airlines Inc. (DAL) ’s Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery has been
shut for repairs since December.  “Gasoline is supported by the supply situation in the
Northeast,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  Hess Shutdown  Hess said the 70,000-barrel-a-day Port Reading refinery
will be shut because it has lost money in two of the past three
years. The plant was “challenged” financially by a requirement
to spend money to comply with environmental regulations for low-
sulfur heating oil and “the weak forecast for gasoline refining
margins,” the company said.  Lipow estimated that the refinery can produce 50,000
barrels a day of gasoline and represents 7.7 percent of PADD 1
gasoline-making capacity.  “People are just concerned about supply,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-
based energy consultant. “There’s a reasonably high and growing
concern about how refineries can stay in business with
consistently volatile margins.”  Distillate fuel stockpiles, including diesel and heating
oil, sank 2.32 million barrels to 130.6 million.  Heating oil for February delivery advanced 0.81 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $3.1173 a gallon, the highest settlement since
Oct. 19. Volume was 4.3 percent above the 100-day average for
the time of day. Futures have risen 2.4 percent this month.  The more actively traded March contract gained 1.01 cents
to $3.1087 a gallon.  The  retail price  for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 3 cents to $3.394 a gallon, the highest level since Nov.
30, AAA said today on its website. Prices at the pump have
climbed for 13 straight days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
