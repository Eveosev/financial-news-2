The dollar weakened to the lowest
level since November 2011 versus the euro as European economic
confidence increased and amid speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will restate its commitment to monetary stimulus.  The greenback pared a gain against the yen as the  U.S.
economy  unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter,
restrained by the biggest plunge in defense spending in 40 years
and dwindling inventories as household purchases picked up. The
 New Zealand dollar  slid against all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts amid bets the nation’s central bank will try to
curb the currency’s strength.  “It continues to be a reduction in the  risk premium  for
euros,” Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview.
“We had a lot of risk last year, and as that probability gets
removed we’ve seen less stress in  Europe . Now you’re seeing more
investors come back into the euro with a medium-term view on
it.”  The dollar fell 0.6 percent to $1.3573 per euro at 12:54
p.m. New York time and reached $1.3578, the weakest since Nov.
18, 2011. The U.S. currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 91.07 yen
after rising 0.8 percent earlier to 91.41, the highest since
June 2010. The euro touched 123.86 yen, the strongest level
since May 2010, before trading at 123.60, up 1 percent.  The Fed will issue a policy statement at about 2:15 p.m.
New York time after a two-day meeting. The central bank is
buying $85 billion a month of Treasuries and mortgage bonds to
spur the economy and reduce unemployment in its third round of
quantitative easing.  Latest Purchases  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s latest bond buying will
reach $1.14 trillion before he ends the program in the first
quarter of 2014, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists. The central bank bought $2.3 trillion
of securities from 2008 to 2011 in its first two efforts under
the strategy.  The  New Zealand  dollar slid as investors speculated the
 Reserve Bank  of New Zealand will make comments intended to
weaken the currency as officials set monetary policy at a
meeting tomorrow.  The kiwi, as the currency is nicknamed, dropped 1 percent
to 83.12 U.S. cents. Australia’s dollar depreciated 0.5 percent
to $1.0426.  Real Falls  Brazil ’s real fell for the first time in six days against
the greenback as Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said a weaker
currency helps the nation’s industry. It dropped as much as 0.7
percent, its biggest intraday slide since Dec. 17, to 1.9999 per
dollar before trading at 1.9894, down 0.2 percent.  The  Indian rupee  rose to a three-month high versus the
dollar on optimism the first interest-rate cut by the central
bank in nine months will spur economic  growth , attracting
investors. The  Reserve Bank of India  lowered its benchmark
repurchase rate to 7.75 percent from 8 percent yesterday.  India ’s currency gained 0.9 percent to 53.3050 per dollar
and reached 53.2750, its strongest level since Oct. 18.  The euro advanced as an  index  of executive and consumer
sentiment in the 17-nation euro region increased to 89.2 from a
revised 87.8 in December, the European Commission in Brussels
said today. That’s the highest since June. Economists in a
Bloomberg News survey forecast a rise to 88.2.  The shared currency may strengthen further against the
dollar as the region’s economy exceeds forecasts, according to
 Alan Ruskin , global head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York. He spoke in an
interview on  Bloomberg Radio ’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  Surprise Index  Citigroup Inc.’s economic surprise  index  for the euro area,
which measures how data are beating or trailing median
forecasts, rose on Jan. 25 to 66.50, the most since Jan. 31,
2011. It was 63.60 today. Positive readings suggest the economic
releases have on balance been better than the Bloomberg
consensus.  The euro has gained 3 percent in 2013, the biggest advance
among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar has lost 0.2 percent,
and the yen has tumbled 5.5 percent.  The European currency rose today even as data showed
Spain’s  recession  deepened in the fourth quarter more than
forecast. The Madrid-based National Statistics Institute said
 gross domestic product   fell  0.7 percent from the previous
quarter, when it declined 0.3 percent.  Region Stabilizing  While “it still doesn’t look good in southern Europe,”
other reports have signaled the region as a whole is stabilizing
and the euro may climb to $1.37 by the end of March,  Niels Christensen , chief currency strategist at Nordea Bank AB in
Copenhagen, said in an interview. There’s a 77 percent chance of
the euro climbing to that level by the end of the first quarter,
according to options data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yen pared its loss versus the dollar after Commerce
Department data showed U.S. gross domestic product declined at a
0.1 percent annual rate, weaker than any economist forecast in a
Bloomberg survey and the worst performance since the second
quarter of 2009, when the world’s largest economy was still in
the recession. The Bloomberg poll’s estimate was a 1.1 percent
increase.  The Japanese currency fell against the majority of its 16
most-traded counterparts. It has lost 5.6 percent against the
greenback over the past month as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has
pushed for “bold monetary policy” to weaken the currency and
defeat deflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
