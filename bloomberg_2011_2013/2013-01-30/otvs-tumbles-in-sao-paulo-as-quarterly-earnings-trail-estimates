Totvs SA (TOTS3)  fell the most in eight
months in  Sao Paulo  after the business-management software
developer’s fourth-quarter earnings trailed some analysts’
estimates.  Shares dropped 4.4 percent to 42.12 reais at 12:42 p.m.
local time after earlier tumbling as much as 6.3 percent in the
steepest intraday decline since May 15. It was the worst
performance on the MSCI Brazil Index, which slid 1.4 percent.  Fourth-quarter net income was 66.9 million reais ($33.7
million), Sao Paulo-based Totvs said in a statement after the
close of trading yesterday. That was below Bradesco BBI’s
estimate of 69.9 million reais and Itau BBA’s forecast of 69.7
million reais. The margin on earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization was 25.9 percent, down 10 basis
points from a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.9 percent to 361.5
million reais.  The quarterly results “were weaker than expected, mostly
due to the Ebitda margin contraction and top line slightly below
our estimates,” Bradesco BBI analysts Luis Azevedo and Tales
Freire wrote in a research note today. “We were expecting a
spike in results due to seasonal variation, which did not
happen.”  Totvs has advanced 39 percent in the past year, while the
 MSCI Brazil Index (MXBR)  fell 14 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
