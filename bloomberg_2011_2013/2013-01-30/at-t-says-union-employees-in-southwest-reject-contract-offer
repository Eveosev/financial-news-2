AT&T Inc. (T) , the biggest U.S. phone
company, said employees in its landline unit in the Southwest
region rejected a four-year labor agreement.  The employees, represented by the Communications Workers of
America’s District 6, are under a contract that expires April 6,
Dallas-based AT&T said in a statement. The new offer would have
covered 20,000 employees in  Arkansas , Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma
and Texas.  AT&T said it will keep working to reach an agreement.
Workers represented by the CWA in AT&T’s Midwest and Southeast
divisions and its corporate technology division agreed last year
to three-year contracts, covering about 40,000 landline
employees, the company said.  AT&T fell less than 1 percent to $34.61 at 3:46 p.m. in  New
York . The shares climbed 11 percent last year, compared with a
13 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
