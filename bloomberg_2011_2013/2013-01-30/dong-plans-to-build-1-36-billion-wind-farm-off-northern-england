Dong Energy A/S, the worldâ€™s largest
offshore wind developer, will build a 1 billion euro ($1.36
billion) facility off the northern England coast that will be
able to supply enough power for 210,000 British homes a year.  The 210-megawatt Westermost Rough venture will use 35
turbines made by  Siemens AG (SIE) , each with a 6-megawatt capacity,
the Danish utility said today in a statement. The investment
includes construction of power transmission assets to be sold to
an operator when the wind farm starts up, Dong said.  The Fredericia-based company will begin work at the site 8
kilometers (5 miles) from the Yorkshire coast in the first half
of 2014, with commissioning in early 2015, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
