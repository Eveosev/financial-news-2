Australian  stocks  and Japanese
equity futures were little changed after the  U.S. economy 
unexpectedly came to a standstill and the  Federal Reserve  said
it will maintain its asset-buying program.  BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company, slid
0.6 percent as companies tied to economic growth retreated.
Pharmaxis Ltd. tumbled 50 percent after U.S. regulators said
there isn’t sufficient data to show its drug Bronchitol improves
lung function in cystic fibrosis patients. Nintendo Co. shares
may be active after the gamemaker increased its net-income
forecast.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 11,060 in Chicago yesterday, down from 11,100 at
the close in Osaka. They were bid in the pre-market at 11,060 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  was little
changed and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.2 percent.  “The U.S. GDP number is surprisingly weak,” said Chris
Green, Auckland-based strategist at First NZ Capital Ltd., a
brokerage and wealth management firm. “We’re seeing pressure on
the pace of momentum of late and therefore we’re a little bit
more cautious.”  The Federal Reserve said yesterday it will keep purchasing
securities at the rate of $85 billion a month as the economy
paused because of temporary forces including bad weather.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  were little
changed today. The gauge yesterday retreated 0.4 percent from a
five-year high, after gross domestic product dropped at a 0.1
percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. The figure was weaker
than any economist forecast in a Bloomberg survey and the worst
since the second quarter of 2009.  The data came two days before a Labor Department report
expected to show employers added 165,000 workers this month,
according to economists’ projections in a Bloomberg survey.
The  unemployment rate  probably held at 7.8 percent, matching
December and November as the lowest since the beginning of 2009,
they said.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average yesterday closed above
11,000 for the first time since April 2010. Equities surged 28
percent from Nov. 14, when elections were announced, on optimism
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new government will take the
necessary steps to fight deflation.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 0.3 percent in  New York 
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
