The head of  Syria ’s main opposition
group called for a meeting with his coalition after angering
members by saying he’d be willing to hold conditional talks with
President Bashar al-Assad’s government.  The “suffering and humiliation” of the Syrian people has
become unbearable, and countries are promising help without
offering anything, said Mouaz al-Khatib, leader of the Syrian
National Coalition. “I am ready to sit with representatives of
the Syrian regime” as a goodwill gesture to find a political
solution, he said in a statement today.  Among conditions he listed for talks are the release of
160,000 prisoners held in Syrian prisons and the renewal of
passports for at least two years. Al-Khatib said he would be
willing to meet with Syrian government representatives in Cairo,
Tunisia or Istanbul.  The Syrian National Coalition said Al-Khatib’s statement
doesn’t represent the bloc’s viewpoint and is “against the Doha
Charter, which rejects negotiations with the criminal regime.”
In a second statement, Al-Khatib said his comments were personal
and that a meeting seeking to find common ground will take place
tomorrow, Al-Khatib said.  International allies meeting in  Kuwait  today pledged $1.5
billion to help Syrian civilians in the country, where at least
60,000 people have died since fighting began in March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
