Lithuania’s  economy  grew slower than
economists predicted in the fourth quarter, the statistics
office said, citing a preliminary estimate.  Gross domestic product advanced 4 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 4.4 percent in the previous three months,
the  statistics office  in the capital, Vilnius, said today by e-
mail. That’s less than the 4.5 percent median estimate of three
economists in a Bloomberg survey. GDP rose a seasonally adjusted
1 percent from the third quarter.  Lithuania’s economy grew 3.6 percent in 2012, the
statistics office said, with the Finance Ministry projecting 3
percent expansion this year. The Baltic economy is outpacing
growth in most of  Europe  and measures to cut the budget deficit
in December have reassured investors, according to Mohammed Kazmi, a London-based economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.  The statistics office is due to release a breakdown of
fourth-quarter GDP data on Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
