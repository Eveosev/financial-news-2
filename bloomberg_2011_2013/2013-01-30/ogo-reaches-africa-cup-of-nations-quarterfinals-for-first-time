Togo drew 1-1 with  Tunisia  to
qualify for the quarterfinals of soccer’s Africa Cup of Nations
for the first time.  Togo and Tunisia finished tied in Group D with four points,
three behind group winner Ivory Coast, with Togo taking second
place on goal difference. The top two teams in each of the four
groups advance to the quarterfinal round in  South Africa .  Serge Gakpe gave Togo the lead in the 13th minute in
Nelspruit and Khaled Mouelhi tied the score with a penalty kick
in the 30th minute.  Togo was denied a penalty late in the second half after
Emmanuel Adebayor was tripped by goalkeeper Moez Ben Cherifa.
Tunisia then had a chance to claim second place moments later
after being awarded another penalty after Saber Khelifa went
down in the area, but Mouelhi hit the post with his spot kick.  Ivory Coast , which had already qualified for the final
eight, rallied for a 2-2 draw with Algeria in Rustenburg.  Algeria took a 2-0 lead on Sofiane Feghouli’s penalty kick
in the 64th minute and a El Arbi Soudani’s goal six minutes
later. Didier Drogba scored with a header for the Ivory Coast in
the 77th minute and Wilfried Bony tied the score four minutes
later.  Ghana plays  Cape Verde  and host South Africa meets Mali in
the quarterfinal games on Feb. 2, with Ivory Coast facing
Nigeria and Togo taking on Burkina Faso the following day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
