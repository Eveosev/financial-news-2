Italy’s government bonds fell as
demand declined at an auction of 10-year bonds after borrowing
costs slid to the lowest level in more than two years last week.  Italian 10-year  yields  climbed to a three-week high as the
nation sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.75 billion) of the securities.
Spanish bonds dropped as a government report showed gross
domestic product shrank more than economists forecast.  Germany ’s
bunds fell, pushing two-year note yields toward the highest in
10 months, as a decline in financial-institution borrowing from
the European Central Bank sapped demand for the euro-region’s
safest assets.  “The market is digesting the supply, there’s been quite a
heavy chunk,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist
at Commerzbank AG in London. “The bid-to-cover ratio was
somewhat lower. Overall, it’s a fairly natural reaction to see
the market take a breather after the recent rally.”  Italian  10-year yields  climbed 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 4.32 percent as of 5 p.m. London time,
after reaching 4.33 percent, the highest level since Jan. 9. The
5.5 percent security maturing in November 2022 fell 1.205, or
12.05 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 109.69. The rate
dropped to 4.07 percent on Jan. 25, the least since Nov. 10,
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 3.5 billion euros of 10-year
debt at 4.17 percent, down from 4.48 percent at the previous
auction on Dec. 28 and the lowest since Oct. 28, 2010. Investors
bid for 1.32 times the amount of the 10-year debt allotted, down
from 1.47 times on Dec. 28. The nation also sold 3 billion euros
of notes due in 2017.  Spanish Data  Spanish bonds dropped as the National Statistics Institute
said gross domestic product fell 0.7 percent last quarter from
the previous three months, when it declined 0.3 percent. That’s
more than the 0.6 percent contraction the Bank of Spain
predicted on Jan. 23.  Spain’s 10-year yield added seven basis points to 5.23
percent.  Benchmark  10-year bund  yields climbed to a four-month high
after euro-area banks decreased three-month borrowing at the ECB
even as they prepare to repay longer-term emergency loans.  Financial institutions borrowed 3.7 billion euros from the
ECB, less than the 6.2 billion euros in three-month loans from
the previous operation that need to be repaid tomorrow. Interest
is linked to the average ECB benchmark rate, currently at 0.75
percent, over the period of the loan.  Euribor Futures  Euribor futures fell after the data, with the implied yield
on the contract expiring in December rising three basis points
to 0.56 percent. Three-month Euribor was at 0.23 percent today,
according to data from the European Banking Federation.  “The fact it was a small number implies more money being
drained out of the system,” said  Harvinder Sian , a senior
fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
London. “It implies a tightening and higher rates at the front
end,” he said, referring to shorter-maturity German securities.  Germany’s  two-year note  yields climbed two basis points to
0.29 percent. The rate reached 0.32 percent on Jan. 28, the
highest level since March 21. The nation’s 10-year yield also
rose two basis points, to 1.71 percent, after touching 1.73
percent, the highest since Sept. 17.  Italian bonds returned 2.1 percent this month through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities gained 2.2 percent, while German bunds handed
investors a loss of 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
