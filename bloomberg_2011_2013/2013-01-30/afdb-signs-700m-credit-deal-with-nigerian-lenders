The  African Development Bank  said it
signed an agreement to provide credit of $700 million to two
Nigerian lenders to finance non-oil exports in the West African
nation.  Africa ’s development lender, also known as AfDB, will
provide $500 to Lagos-based Bank of Industry and the Nigerian
Export-Import Bank in addition to technical assistance for
disbursement, it said late yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
The loans will target “export-oriented small and medium
enterprises,” Ousman Dore, AfDB’s representative in  Nigeria ,
said in the statement.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country of more than 160
million people, is seeking to reduce dependence on oil exports,
which account for about 80 percent of government revenue and
more than 95 percent of export income. The government wants to
reduce oil’s contribution to revenue to 60 percent in the medium
term, Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said Dec. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
