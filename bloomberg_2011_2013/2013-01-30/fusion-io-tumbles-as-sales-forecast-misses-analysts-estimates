Fusion-io Inc. (FIO) , a maker of data-
storage computers, plunged 13 percent to the lowest price since
September 2011 after giving a forecast for fiscal third-quarter
sales that was lower than analysts projected.  Sales in the period that ends in March will be about $80
million, and the operating loss will be $10 million to $15
million excluding certain items, Fusion-io said in a statement
yesterday. Analysts on average had estimated sales of $137.7
million and operating profit of $16.7 million, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  forecast  reflects reduced orders from its two largest
 customers , Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc., which shifted the
timing of their purchases, Salt Lake City-based Fusion-io said.
Apple and Facebook together account for 51 percent of the
company’s business, and have decided to be more “efficient”
with their spending the next two quarters, Fusion-io Chief
Executive Officer David Flynn said in an interview.  “The schedules are completely up to our customers,” he
said. “We call it like we see it when we issue forecasts.”  Shares of Fusion-io fell to $17.48 at the close in  New
York . That followed a 5.3 percent  drop  on Jan. 29, a day after
disk-drive maker  Seagate Technology Plc (STX)  invested $40 million in
Virident Systems Inc., a Fusion-io competitor. The stock has
declined 24 percent in the past 12 months.  Fusion-io, which employs Apple co-founder  Steve Wozniak  as
chief scientist, sells corporate storage computers based on
 flash memory , which is faster yet more expensive than widely
used magnetic disk drives.  For the fiscal second quarter, which ended in December,
sales rose 43 percent to $120.6 million, and profit excluding
certain costs was $13.7 million, or 13 cents a share, Fusion-io
said. Analysts on average had  predicted  sales of $119.9 million
and profit of 8 cents.  Sales for the fiscal year that ends in June will be $420
million to $440 million, Fusion-io said, compared with analysts’
average estimate of $530.8 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
