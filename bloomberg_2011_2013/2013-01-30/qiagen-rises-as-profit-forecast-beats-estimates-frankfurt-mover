Qiagen NV (QGEN) , a maker of medical
diagnostic equipment, increased to its highest value in two-and-
a-half years after forecasting 2013 profit that exceeded
analystsâ€™ estimates.  Qiagen climbed 6.8 percent to 15.66 euros in Frankfurt, the
highest closing price since July 15, 2010, giving the company a
market value of 3.6 billion euros ($4.9 billion).  Adjusted earnings this year will rise to about $1.16 to
$1.18 a share, Qiagen said in a statement late yesterday.
Analysts had predicted profit of $1.12, the average of 31
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Qiagen is based in Venlo, the Netherlands, with management
offices in Hilden,  Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
