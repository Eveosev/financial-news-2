D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) , the largest U.S.
homebuilder by volume, plans to raise $700 million in a two-part
bond offering.  The company intends to issue $300 million of senior notes
due 2020 and $400 million of securities maturing 2025, Fort
Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton said today in a regulatory
filing. Proceeds from the offering, which would add to the
firm’s $2.36 billion of  notes outstanding , will be used for
general corporate purposes.  D.R. Horton’s $350 million of 4.375 percent debt due
September 2022 traded yesterday at 103.3 cents on the dollar to
yield 3.97 percent, or 196 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The company’s stock rose to its highest level in almost six
years yesterday after reporting that earnings more than doubled
in the fiscal first quarter.  D.R. Horton  is rated  Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Service and
BB- at Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
