Electricite de France SA, the French
utility, agreed to use turbines from  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ’s
Repower Systems unit for a 350-megawatt wind farm in  Quebec .  EDF’s Riviere-du-Moulin wind farm received final permits
from the Quebec provincial government and expects to begin
construction this year, the company’s EDF EN Canada unit said
today in a statement.  An initial 150-megawatt phase is expected to begin
producing power in December 2014 and the second 200-megawatt
phase will follow a year later. The provincial utility Hydro-
Quebec will buy the power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
