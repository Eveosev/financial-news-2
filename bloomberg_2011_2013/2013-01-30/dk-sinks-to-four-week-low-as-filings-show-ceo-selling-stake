LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , a Chinese
photovoltaic maker with more than $3.1 billion in  debt , fell to
the lowest this year after Chief Executive Officer Xiaofeng Peng
filed for a  fifth  time this month to sell shares in the company.  American depositary receipts of LDK Solar, based in Xinyu,
 China , tumbled 8.3 percent in their fourth day of declines to
$1.54 in New York, the lowest close since Dec. 31. The ADRs have
plunged 30 percent from a six-month high of $2.21 reached on
Jan. 9. Trading volume on the ADRs was 1.5 times the daily
average over the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  LDK New Energy Holding Ltd., LDK Solar’s controlling
shareholder which is wholly owned by Peng, filed on Jan. 18 to
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell 394,000
ADRs, increasing its stake sale since Nov. 29 to 4.7 million
ADRs, a document made public today showed. Total proceeds from
the sales add up to $7.3 million, according to the document
signed by Peng.  LDK Solar, the world’s biggest maker of wafers for solar
cells after  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , agreed to issue and
sell 17 million new shares to Fulai Investments Ltd. for $31
million, according to a Jan. 22 statement. The new shares,
representing about 12 percent stake of LDK, would be sold for
$1.83 each to Fulai, which is incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands, the statement said.  The company hired Citigroup Inc. last month to help
renegotiate its liabilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
