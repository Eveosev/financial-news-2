Chile’s peso gained as speculation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will extend its bond-buying
program to boost the world’s largest economy through 2014 lifted
the price of copper, the Andean country’s biggest export.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 471.16 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:23 a.m. Santiago time as copper headed for a three-month high
in  New York . Chile’s currency has strengthened 1.7 percent this
month, the best performance among the six most-traded peers in
 Latin America  after  Brazil ’s real.  The Fed’s latest round of bond buying won’t end until next
year’s first quarter, according to median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The peso’s appreciation is being limited
by concern the central bank may take steps to slow its rise
should it pass 470 per dollar, said Cristian Donoso, a trader at
Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago.  “What stops the appreciation is the ghost of the central
bank below 470 per dollar,” Donoso said in a phone interview.
“At that level there’s a lot more interest in buying dollars
again.”  Chile’s peso was headed for its strongest close against the
yen since September 2008. The euro, used by traders as an
indicator of the weakness of the dollar, appreciated past $1.35
for the first time since 2011 and reached a seven-month high of
639.64 pesos. Economic confidence in the euro area rose more
than economists forecast in January, adding to signs that the
17-nation currency bloc may be emerging from a slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
