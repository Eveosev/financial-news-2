U.K. Business Secretary  Vince Cable 
wrote to the chairmen and chief executive officers of the seven
FTSE 100 companies without women on their boards to challenge
them about what action they’re taking to recruit them.  Cable wrote following  Randgold Resources Ltd (RRS) ’s Jan. 28
announcement that it had appointed Jeanine Mabunda Lioko as a
non-executive director. The only companies in the U.K.’s
benchmark index with all-male boards are  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) ,  Croda
International Plc (CRDA) , Glencore International Plc,  Xstrata Plc (XTA) ,
 Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) ,  Melrose Industries Plc (MRO)  and  Vedanta Resources Plc, (VED) 
Cable’s office said.  “My vision by 2015 is that Britain will not have a single
FTSE 100 board without a significant female presence,” Cable
said in an e-mailed statement today. “This is not about
equality, this is about good governance and good business.”  According to Cable, the number of all-male boards in the
FTSE 100 has fallen from 21 in 2010. He said that while some
businesses, especially those in mining, had “unique
challenges” in diversifying their boards, partly because of the
frequent travel and project work involved, companies have to
take action.  The business secretary appointed women to half of the six
positions on the advisory board of the government’s new business
bank on Jan. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
