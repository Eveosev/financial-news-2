Michael L. Brosnan has stepped down
as chief of large bank oversight at the U.S. Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency in a request that took the agency
head by surprise.  Brosnan requested reassignment at the agency after
supervising large banks since the 2008 credit crisis, according
to an OCC statement released today. Martin Pfinsgraff will take
over as acting senior deputy comptroller for large bank
supervision. Pfinsgraff, a former treasurer at a unit of
 Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  who has been the OCC’s deputy
comptroller for credit and market risk, will assume the new role
next month, the statement said.  “Now that we are moving beyond the crisis, I can
understand why Mike was interested in moving into a new
position,” Comptroller of the Currency  Thomas Curry  said in the
statement, which described the initial request as a surprise.
“He worked long days, grappled with the toughest decisions that
confronted bank supervisors anywhere in the world, and
contributed greatly to the healing of the industry.”  Brosnan has accepted a position as examiner-in-charge for
the national bank of  Salt Lake City , Utah-based  Zions
Bancorporation (ZION) , according to the statement. He spent more than
21 years at the OCC before leaving in 2004 to join MBNA Corp.,
which was acquired in 2006 by  Bank of America Corp .  Darrin Benhart, one of two deputy comptrollers running the
Credit and Market Risk Group, will temporarily take over the
entire group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
