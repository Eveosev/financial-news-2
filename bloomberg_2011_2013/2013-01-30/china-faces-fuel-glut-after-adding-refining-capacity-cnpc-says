China  faces a fuel glut this year as
new oil-refining capacity outpaces demand growth even amid a
government drive to use more natural gas, according to the
nation’s biggest oil and gas producer.  The nation’s crude-processing capacity will increase by
39.5 million metric tons a year to 614 million a year in 2013,
while actual throughput will climb 5.4 percent to 489 million
tons, China National Petroleum Corp. said in an annual report
released in Beijing today. Demand for gasoline, diesel and
kerosene will expand 5.8 percent to 293 million tons, it said.
Crude is also turned into  fuel oil  and feedstock for
petrochemicals.  China, the world’s second-largest oil consumer,  processed  a
record 10.2 million barrels a day in December, according to data
from the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics. Refiners
have stepped up operations amid a rebound in economic growth
just as the government encourages the use of cleaner-burning gas
to curb pollution. Gas demand will advance 12 percent to 165
billion cubic meters this year, CNPC said  “If refining rates keep rising, the domestic fuel market
might witness an obvious oversupply,” CNPC said in the report.
“Gas demand for power and industrial use will grow steadily.”  Apparent oil demand, or domestic processing plus net
 imports  of refined products, will increase 4.8 percent to 514
million tons this year, CNPC said in the report. Net overseas
purchases of crude will advance 7.3 percent to 289 million tons
and account for 58 percent of consumption, it said.  Import Dependency  China’s crude imports will be capped at 61 percent of total
demand through 2015, the State Council, or cabinet, said in a
statement on Jan. 24. The ratio averaged 57 percent in 2012.  Imports of gas by sea and pipeline will rise 24 percent to
53 billion cubic meters in 2013 and account for 32 percent of
total consumption, according to the report. Liquefied natural
gas shipments are predicted to increase 15 percent to 16.5
million tons, while pipeline deliveries will gain 32 percent to
30 billion cubic meters.  China’s economy  will expand 8.1 percent in 2013, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey this month. Growth
was 7.9 percent in the three months ended December, snapping a
seven-quarter slowdown.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
