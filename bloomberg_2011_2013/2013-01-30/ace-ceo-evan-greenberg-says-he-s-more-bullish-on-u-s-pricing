Evan Greenberg, the chief executive
officer of  Ace Ltd. (ACE) , said the company is poised to benefit as
the insurer and its rivals charge more to clients for commercial
coverage.  “From what I see today, I am more bullish about the
pricing environment in the U.S. than I have been for some
time,” Greenberg said in a conference call today held by the
Zurich-based insurer. Excluding property coverage, “the level
of rate increases we received in the fourth quarter, which has
continued into the first quarter, is the best we’ve seen in a
number of years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
