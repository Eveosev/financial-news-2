Peru ’s sol dropped to a seven-week
low after the government pledged to aid the central bank in
removing excess dollars from the spot market to curb gains.  The sol slipped 0.2 percent to 2.5665 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
the weakest since Dec. 11.  Peru’s  Finance Ministry  will buy $4 billion from the spot
market this year, including $2 billion to prepay debt, as it
seeks to curb a rally in the sol after it touched a 16-year high
this month. The country may also increase the percentage of
assets that local pension funds can invest abroad next month to
ease demand for the currency, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla
said in an interview yesterday.  “This says to the market the currency is such an important
issue that the ministry, central bank, the regulator all have to
be involved,” said Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco
Internacional del Peru SAA.  The central bank bought $13.9 billion in the  spot market 
last year and has purchased $1.8 billion this month to curb
appreciation.  The sol has weakened 1.1 percent since touching 2.5375 on
Jan. 14, the strongest level since 1996,  data  from Peru’s
financial regulator show.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 climbed one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 3.88 percent at 3:01 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.09
centimo to 125.46 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
