Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305) ,
the world’s biggest maker of giant excavators used in mining,
had a third-quarter loss as Chinese sales slumped and falling
coal prices slowed sales to miners in  Southeast Asia .  The company had a loss of 3.4 billion yen ($37 million) in
the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of 6.6
billion yen a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on nine-month results released today. The company left its
full-year profit forecast unchanged at 33 billion yen.  Hitachi, which is also  Japan ’s second-largest producer of
construction equipment, follows  Komatsu Ltd. (6301)  in lowering
quarterly profit after China’s supply glut for excavators hurt
earnings in the biggest construction equipment market and mining
activity in  Indonesia , the world’s biggest exporter of power
station coal, declined.  Sales are seen at 740 billion yen for the year through
March 31, leaving its October estimate unchanged, according to
the company’s statement.  Hitachi Construction Machinery said today in a separate
statement that industrywide sales of excavators in  China  will
likely fall 40 percent in the current year, the biggest drop of
any region. Indonesian sales will slide 23 percent. Excavator
sales in Japan are forecast to increase 18 percent, while U.S.
sales are seen increasing 27 percent, the statement said.  Indonesia has cut its benchmark  price  for coal by 20
percent to $87.55 a metric ton this month from $109.29 a year
ago, according to the Directorate General of Coal and Minerals
at the energy ministry.  Hitachi’s operating  margin  increased by 1.35 percentage
points to 6.71 percent in the year ended March 31, almost half
the level of Komatsu, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hitachi Construction Machinery, half owned by electronics
maker  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , closed up 3.8 percent at 2,030 yen in Tokyo
trading, extending this year’s gain to 13 percent. The results
were released after the market close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
