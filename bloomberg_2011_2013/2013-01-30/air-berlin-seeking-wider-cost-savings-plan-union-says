Air Berlin Plc (AB1) , Europe’s third-
biggest discount airline, is seeking in excess of 10 percent
more in savings than previously announced in an effort to return
to profit, according to a Ver.di labor union official.  The carrier is pushing for 450 million euros ($611 million)
in cost reductions and extra revenue, with half of the figure
coming from reorganizing routes and flying fewer planes and half
from lowering costs for personnel, supplies and services, the
official said today in an e-mail. That compares with a 400
million-euro target for the earnings-improvement program
outlined by the Berlin-based company on Jan. 15.  Top executives are volunteering to receive a 10 percent
salary cut, and managers at the next level of the hierarchy
would be asked to forgo 5 percent of pay, the Ver.di official
said. Mathias Radowski, an Air Berlin spokesman, declined to
comment on any proposals because the airline is in talks with
unions about the program.  Air Berlin, part-owned by Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways
PJSC, hasn’t been profitable since 2007. The savings program for
2014 set out two weeks ago includes eliminating 900 jobs, or
almost 10 percent of the workforce, and cutting the fleet by 10
percent to 142 aircraft. The project is the first undertaken by
the carrier since Wolfgang Prock-Schauer took over as chief
executive officer on Jan. 7.  Proposed service reductions include eliminating bases at
seven smaller German cities, while employees are being asked to
give up the so-called 13th month of pay common in the country’s
labor market, the Ver.di official said. The jobs to be
eliminated would include 250 flight attendants, 160 technicians,
145 ground-handling posts and 110 pilots, as well as 120
positions at the Berlin headquarters, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
