Diminishing rubber supplies and
record car sales are extending a five-month  bull market  that’s
poised to raise costs for tiremakers.  The surplus will contract 61 percent in 2013 as global
consumption rises to a record high, according to the 35-nation
Singapore-based International Rubber Study Group. Futures will
advance 11 percent to 350 yen a kilogram ($3,849 a metric ton)
in Tokyo this year from the current 314.5 yen, the median of 12
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Thailand, Indonesia and  Malaysia , representing 67 percent
of global output, are cutting down trees and stockpiling to
bolster prices that slumped to an almost three-year low of 205.6
yen in August. Futures surged into a bull market the following
month as supply contracted and economies strengthened, boosting
demand for cars. Tires account for 70 percent of rubber
consumption.  “Less supply from  Thailand  and other Southeast Asian
countries will help prices,” said Makoto Sugitani, the head of
sales at Newedge  Japan  Inc. in Tokyo who correctly predicted in
October that prices would gain 10 percent by the end of 2012.
“Expectations for a global economic recovery will accelerate
rubber’s advance.”  Rubber rose 4 percent on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange this
year, extending its gain since the August low to 53 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials advanced 4.2
percent this month and the MSCI All-Country  World Index (MXWD)  of
equities added 4.5 percent. Treasuries lost 1.1 percent, a Bank
of America Corp. index shows.  Plantation Acres  Global stockpiles reached a seven-year high of 2 million
tons at the end of 2012, enough to meet North America demand for
about two years, according to IRSG data. The biggest growers
responded by agreeing to cut down aging trees across 247,000
acres of plantations, an area about 50 percent greater than
 Singapore , and reduce exports by 300,000 tons in the six months
to March.  Indonesia , the second-largest producer, will harvest 8.9
percent less this year, the first retreat since 2009, the
agriculture ministry said in December. While the government in
Thailand, the biggest grower, expects domestic output to
increase 3.4 percent in 2013, it has already bought more than
182,000 tons to stockpile. Malaysian farmers may produce 6.5
percent more, according to the nation’s rubber board.  The International Rubber Consortium Ltd., which coordinated
the reductions, will meet this quarter to decide if the cuts
should be extended, said Chief Secretary Yium Tavarolit. The
three-nation group hasn’t said when it plans to sell the supply
being stockpiled.  Car Market  A fourth consecutive year of rising demand will narrow the
surplus to 179,000 tons and 153,000 tons in 2014, from 460,000
tons in 2012, the IRSG predicts.  China , which consumes 34
percent of the world’s rubber, will buy 7.2 percent more, up
from 4.5 percent in 2012, the group estimates.  Rising prices may boost costs for  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) ,
Michelin & Cie. and  Goodyear (GT)  Tire & Rubber Co., the biggest
tiremakers. Bridgestone used a record 1.89 million tons of
natural rubber and its oil-derived synthetic equivalent in 2012,
said Makoto Shiomi, a spokesman for the company. He declined to
say whether Bridgestone had locked in prices for future supply.  “We aren’t so confident that demand is getting better,”
Shiomi said. “Recent movements in rubber prices don’t affect
the pace of consumption.”  Monetary Fund  Japan and the 17-nation euro area tumbled back into
recessions and the  International Monetary Fund  cut its estimate
for 2013 global growth to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent on Jan.
23. Natural-rubber inventories in China reached 101,482 tons on
Jan. 10, the highest since March 2010,  Shanghai  Futures Exchange
data show.  The rebound means most plantations are profitable and may
spur extra shipments from producers outside the three-nation
group restricting supply, said Prachaya Jumpasut, the managing
director of the Rubber Economist, a London-based adviser to the
industry. Rubber trees can be grown anywhere that has a similar
climate to a tropical  rain forest , with plantations in parts of
 Africa  and  Latin America .  Consumption will exceed supply by 46,000 tons this year,
compared with a deficit of 15,000 tons in 2012, according to
RCMA Commodities Asia Group. The Singapore-based trading
company’s estimate assumes a 220,000-ton reduction in shipments
from the biggest producers. The global rubber market is valued
at $38.5 billion, based on annual consumption.  Commercial Vehicles  Bridgestone will report a 17 percent gain in profit to 205
billion yen this year, according to the mean of 17 analyst
 forecasts  compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of the Tokyo-based
company rose 38 percent to 2,393 yen in the past year and may
reach 2,503 yen in the next 12 months, based on 13  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Almost 50 percent of the rubber used by Bridgestone is
synthetic, with the proportion of the natural material typically
increasing for tires designed for heavier vehicles, Shiomi said.
A tire for a medium or heavy commercial vehicle uses as much as
18 kilograms (40 pounds) of natural rubber, while those for
passenger cars contain less than 1 kilogram, according to CLSA
Asia-Pacific Markets.  Global auto sales will rise 2.4 percent to 82.7 million
this year, according to LMC Automotive Ltd., a research company
in Oxford,  England . China may surpass 20 million for the first
time this year, the state-backed China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers said Jan. 11.  “Demand from China’s tire-making industry will rise,”
said Tong Jingjing, an analyst at Sri Trang (Shanghai) Ltd., a
unit of Thailand’s biggest publicly traded rubber exporter.
“Supply from Southeast Asian producing countries will be
limited.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
