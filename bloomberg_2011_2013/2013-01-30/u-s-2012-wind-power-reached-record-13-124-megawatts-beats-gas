U.S. wind-energy developers added a
record 13,124 megawatts of turbines last year, beating natural
gas to become the largest new source of power generation for the
first time.  In the fourth quarter alone, 8,380 megawatts of wind farms
were completed, more than double that of any prior quarter,
according to the Washington-based  American Wind Energy
Association . That amounted to 42 percent of new power supplies,
more than any electricity source including natural gas, coal,
solar and nuclear. topping natural gas  Installations accelerated last quarter as developers raced
to take advantage of a federal tax credit that was due to expire
Dec. 31, and have slumped this year, according to Rob Gramlich,
the industry group’s interim chief executive officer. There are
43 megawatts of  wind turbines  currently under construction in
two states. The production tax credit was extended for one year
Jan. 1.  “We’re getting back to business,” Gramlich said today on
a conference call without predicting how much wind capacity may
be installed this year. “Developers are calling manufacturers
for turbine contracts and talking to utilities about power
purchase agreements.”  The U.S. has more than 60 gigawatts of wind energy capacity
in operation, mostly in Texas, California and  Iowa . That’s
enough to supply about 14.7 million homes, AWEA said.  Wind development was expected to drop as much as 88 percent
this year to about 1,500 megawatts if the tax credit hadn’t been
renewed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
