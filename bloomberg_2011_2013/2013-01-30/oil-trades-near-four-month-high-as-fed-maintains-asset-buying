Oil traded near the highest price in
more than four months in  New York  as the  Federal Reserve 
maintained an asset-purchase program to boost the economy of the
world’s largest crude-consuming nation.  West Texas Intermediate was little changed, heading for the
biggest monthly gain since August. The Fed will keep buying
securities at a rate of $85 billion a month, the  Federal Open
Market Committee  said after a two-day meeting. German
unemployment unexpectedly declined in January for the first time
in 10 months, adding to signs that  Europe ’s largest economy is
gathering pace. Oil gained a third day yesterday even after data
showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose twice as much forecast.  “The Fed is still providing enough money,” said Andy Sommer a senior oil analyst at Axpo Trading AG in Dietikon,
 Switzerland . “I’m pretty optimistic on the demand side. But
there’s an ongoing supply overhang and prices should come down
in the spring.”  WTI for March delivery was at $97.75 a barrel in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , down 20 cents, as
of 1:08 p.m. London time. The average volume of all contracts
traded was 21 percent below the 100-day average. Futures gained
37 cents to $97.94 yesterday, the highest close since Sept. 14.
Prices are up 6.5 percent in January and poised for a third
monthly increase, the longest rising streak since April 2011.  Brent for March settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange was at $114.85 a barrel, down 5 cents. The
average volume of all contracts traded was 6.3 percent below the
100-day average. The European benchmark grade was at a premium
of $17.04 to WTI futures, from $16.96 yesterday.  Crude Inventories  The number of people out of work in  Germany  fell by a
seasonally-adjusted 16,000 to 2.92 million, the Nuremberg-based
Federal Labor Agency said today. Economists had predicted an
increase of 8,000, the median of 31 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey showed. The adjusted jobless rate dropped to 6.8
percent, matching a two-decade low.  The dollar traded near a 14-month low versus the euro,
increasing the investment appeal of commodities priced in the
U.S. currency. It was at $1.3552 per euro after reaching $1.3587
yesterday, the weakest level since November 2011.  U.S. crude inventories increased by  5.9 million barrels 
last week, an Energy Information Administration report showed.
Supplies were forecast to climb by 2.5 million, according to the
median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .
Crude stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
WTI, rose 284,000 barrels to 51.7 million.  Gasoline supplies fell 956,000 barrels, the data showed.
They were projected to gain by  1 million , according to the
survey. Distillate-fuel stockpiles, including heating oil and
diesel, dropped 2.3 million barrels, compared with a forecast
decline of 500,000 barrels in the survey.  ‘Golden Cross’  WTI may extend its rally as futures approach a bullish
technical formation known as a “golden cross.” The 50-day
moving average, at $90.94 a barrel today, has pared its discount
to the 200-day indicator to 3 cents, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Investors typically buy contracts when a moving
average rises over a longer-term one. Another indicator, the 14-
day relative strength index, is higher than 70 for a third day,
signaling the advance may stall.  The lowest oil volatility in 17 years is pushing down
options costs, setting up trades that BNP Paribas SA and
Commerzbank AG say will profit if Middle East supply disruptions
send prices swinging again. BNP in Paris recommends buying
contracts that pay should crude advance and financing them by
selling bearish puts. Commerzbank sees value in bets on Brent
climbing toward $130 a barrel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
