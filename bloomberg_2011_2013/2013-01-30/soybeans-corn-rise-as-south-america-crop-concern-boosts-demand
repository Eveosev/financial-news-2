Soybeans and corn rallied to the
highest prices in more than six weeks as warm, dry weather
threatened crops in  Argentina  and  Brazil , boosting demand
prospects for supplies from the U.S., the world’s top exporter.  Most fields in Argentina and southern Brazil will get less
than 0.5 inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain during the next five
days, before dry weather returns through Feb. 10,  T-Storm
Weather  LLC said in a report today. Temperatures rose above 100
degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) yesterday, increasing stress on
reproducing crops. In central Brazil, frequent rain over the
next 10 days will slow harvesting of mature crops, T-Storm said.  “The weather is more threatening, and some traders are
already talking about lower corn and soybean yields,” Joseph Vaclavik, the president of Standard Grain Inc. in  Chicago , said
in a telephone interview. “The rain in Brazil is slowing
harvesting activity, and that could help to boost demand for
U.S. supplies.”  Soybean futures for March delivery surged 1.9 percent to
close at $14.7875 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since Jan. 14. Earlier, the most-active
contract touched $14.8175, the highest since Dec. 18.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 1.5 percent to $7.4025
a bushel in Chicago, after touching $7.41, the highest for a
most-active contract since Dec. 7.  U.S.  corn  and  soybean  inventories on Dec. 1 fell to the
lowest in nine years after the worst drought since the 1930s cut
production for a third consecutive year.  Forecast Cut  Soybean output in Argentina, the biggest shipper of  animal
feed  and vegetable oil made from the crop, may be cut to 50
million metric tons, Eduardo Sierra, the chief agro-
climatologist at the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange, said today in
an e-mail. That compares with 54 million tons estimated by the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  on Jan. 11  Shipping delays of as much as 35 days in Brazil may help to
boost demand for U.S. crops, Vaclavik said. As many as 126
vessels were scheduled to load 6.2 million tons of soybeans and
corn as of yesterday, according to shipping agency Unimar
Agenciamentos Maritimos Ltda. That compares with 72 ships
carrying 2.8 million tons a year earlier and 47 vessels with 1.5
million tons in 2011, its data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
