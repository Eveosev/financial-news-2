European stocks dropped the most
this year as  Saipem (SPM)  SpA plunged and a report showed that the
U.S. economy unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter.  Saipem plummeted 34 percent after cutting its earnings
forecasts for 2012 and 2013.  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  jumped the most in 32
months after the lender raised its dividend payout ratio to 75
percent of profit after net income more than quadrupled in the
fourth quarter.  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  rose 3.2 percent after reporting
quarterly profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index lost 0.6 percent to 288.63 in
London, falling from its highest level since Feb. 18, 2011. The
gauge has still jumped 3.2 percent in January, heading for its
longest streak of monthly gains since 1997.  “Major risks for  European (SXXP)  equities may occur from
political uncertainty,” Tobias Britsch, who helps manage about
25.6 billion euros ($35 billion) as European equities asset
manager at Meriten Investment Management GmbH, said in a phone
interview from Dusseldorf,  Germany . “The political issues are
unpredictable and this is increasing with elections in Europe
coming up.”  Italy holds a parliamentary election on Feb. 24-25. Pier
Luigi Bersani’s Democratic Party will win the most votes,
according to opinion polls.  U.S. Economy  The U.S economy shrank 0.1 percent at an annual rate in the
fourth quarter, figures from the Commerce Department showed
today. The median estimate of 83 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had called for the world’s largest economy to expand
1.1 percent. Gross domestic product increased 3.1 percent in the
three months through September.  The Federal Reserve will probably renew its commitment to
continue buying assets into next year at a policy decision
today, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 44 economists.

francs. The world’s  biggest maker of cancer drugs  posted
earnings per share excluding some items of 13.62 francs for last
year, falling short of the 13.67-franc  average analyst estimate 
in a Bloomberg survey.  The Basel, Switzerland-based drugmaker raised its dividend
to 7.35 francs a share, less than the  Bloomberg Dividend
Forecast (ROG)  of 7.40 francs. The shares climbed to their highest
price in almost five years on Jan. 24.  Imperial Tobacco  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc sank 4.3 percent to 2,361 pence

largest lender said profit increased 7 percent in the fourth
quarter. Net income climbed to 840 million euros from 785
