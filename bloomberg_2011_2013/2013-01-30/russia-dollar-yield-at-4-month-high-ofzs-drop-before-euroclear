Russia’s dollar debt sank for a
fourth day, pushing yields to the highest since September, as
investors sought assets offering a better return on wagers the
U.S. Federal Reserve will continue stimulus efforts.  The retreat lifted the yield on country’s Eurobond maturing
April 2042 seven basis points to 4.511 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The ruble fell 0.3 percent against Bank Rossii’s
target dollar-euro basket to 34.8628 by 7 p.m. in Moscow, and
was little changed against the dollar at 30.0575.  U.S. gross domestic product dropped at a 0.1 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, the worst performance since the
second quarter of 2009, Commerce Department data showed.
Commodities rose and U.S. Treasuries fell as the contraction
spurred bets the Fed won’t rush to end stimulus efforts.  “Given Russia’s sovereign Eurobonds’ tight spreads to
Treasuries, I would expect them to suffer along with the safe-
heaven bonds as investors continue to reallocate in favor of
higher-yielding assets,” Vladimir Kolychev, head of research at
Societe Generale SA’s OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) , said by e-mail.  U.S. Treasuries dropped for the fifth day with the 10-year
note yield rising to 2.01 percent, the highest level since
April.  Russia’s ruble-denominated government notes maturing in
July 2022 fell, lifting the yield two basis points to 6.67
percent. Euroclear Bank SA said on Jan. 28 it is “highly
unlikely” to be ready to offer foreigners direct settlement at
today’s bond sale.  The  Finance Ministry  held two auctions of so-called OFZs
earlier today, selling 68 percent of the amount tendered.  Soft Demand  “Soft demand for government paper at today’s primary
auctions is hardly surprising, given comments from Euroclear
about further delays in OFZ settlement,” Kolychev said.  The Treasury issued 1.04 billion rubles of debt due
February 2019 at an average yield of 6.31 percent after offering
7.3 billion rubles of the notes. It also placed 18 billion
rubles of OFZs maturing in January 2023 at a 6.75 percent yield
out of 20 billion rubles offered.  “Internal drivers are not enough for the OFZ market to
grow,” according to Yulia Safarbakova, an analyst at BCS
Financial Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
