Azerbaijan plans to raise  renewable
energy  capacity in the country, the third-largest oil producer
of the former  Soviet Union , to about 20 percent of total power
demand by 2020, with investment estimated to reach $7 billion.  The government drew up a strategy to build 2,000 megawatts
of capacity in the next eight years, Ramiz Rzayev, a department
head at the  Ministry  of Industry and Energy, said today by phone
from Baku. Investors will provide most of the funds, he said.  The Caspian Sea nation has spent about $90 million on pilot
renewable-energy projects in the past four years, while output
of crude oil in 2012 declined for a second year. The country
pumped 43 million metric tons of oil last year, down 5.3 percent
from 2011, the State Statistics Committee said on Jan. 17.  -- With assistance from Marc Roca in London. Editor:  Tony Barrett , Reed Landberg  To contact the reporter on this story:
