Abengoa SA (ABG) , the Spanish company
that’s developed desalination plants from  Algeria  to India, said
it’s started commercial operations making salt water potable at
the Qingdao facility in  China .  The plant at the second-largest port in northern China in
Shandong province will produce 100,000 cubic meters of drinking
water a day from seawater, enough to supply the needs of a half-
million people, Abengoa said today in a statement.  Abengoa began building the plant in 2010 and will operate
and maintain it for 25 years. During this time, the company is
forecasting revenue of at least 750 million euros ($1 billion)
from the sale of water and a further 25 million euros from
technical support operations, according to the statement.  The project, the first desalination one of its type carried
out using a project-finance structure entirely financed by local
Chinese banks, required a total investment of 135 million euros,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
