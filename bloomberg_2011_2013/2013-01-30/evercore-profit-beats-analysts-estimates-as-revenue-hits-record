Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the
investment bank founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
 Roger Altman , rose to the highest price in more than 2 1/2 years
as fourth-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates.  Evercore climbed 5.1 percent to close at $37.42 in New
York, the highest since May 2010. The shares have advanced 24
percent this year, compared with the 5.6 percent gain of the
477-company Russell 2000 Financial Services  Index. (RGUSFS)   Net income was $19 million, or 56 cents a share, after
breaking even a year earlier, New York-based Evercore said today
in a statement. Earnings excluding some items more than doubled
to $35.3 million, or 81 cents, exceeding the 52-cent  average
estimate  of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Adjusted net
income for 2012 rose 24 percent to $78.1 million.  “The fourth quarter was a record for Evercore in every
important respect,” Chief Executive Officer Ralph Schlosstein
said on a conference call after earnings were released. “And
2012 was another record year, the fourth consecutive year of
significantly increased net revenues and earnings.”  Global mergers-and-acquisitions volume in the fourth
quarter reached the highest level since 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Evercore executives including Chief
Financial Officer Robert Walsh have said the 2013 deal
environment will be better than last year.  Adjusted net revenue in the fourth quarter surged 90
percent to $212 million from a year earlier. That was led by
investment banking revenue, which more than doubled to $191.6
million. Investment management net revenue declined 4.3 percent
to $20.4 million.  ‘Renewed Enthusiasm’  Revenue for the full year climbed 23 percent to a record
$638.9 million from 2011.  The M&A environment made a “turnaround” in the fourth
quarter following a “fair” year, Altman said on the call.
There is “renewed enthusiasm” for transactions, he said.  Evercore set aside $123 million, or 58 percent of net
revenue, for compensation in the fourth quarter. That compares
with $62 million, or 56 percent, a year earlier.  The firm said it promoted three executives to senior
managing director last year and hired six more. Schlosstein said
he expects to add another six this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
