National Football League  players
whose bid to reopen a 2011 lawsuit settlement over revenue was
rejected by a federal judge in December told the court today
they plan to appeal that decision.  The National Football League Players Association had
claimed the league hid a $123 million-a-club salary cap for the
2010 season. The players sought $3 billion in damages, saying
owners violated an earlier agreement requiring uncapped salaries
that season.  U.S. District Judge David S. Doty in  Minneapolis  on Dec. 31
rejected the claim, finding that the earlier agreement, reached
in 2006, had expired and the players had waived such claims
through their 2011 collective-bargaining agreement. The 2011
accord, settling a labor dispute, included a stipulation of
dismissal of any claims, pending or not, Doty said.  Because the stipulation of dismissal was executed after the
2006 agreement expired, “the court is without jurisdiction to
enforce” it, Doty said in the ruling. “The NFLPA released the
claims it attempts to assert in the underlying action.”  The players said today in a court filing that they would
appeal the decision to the  U.S. Court of Appeals .  The case is White v. National Football League, 92-cv-00906,
U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota (Minneapolis).  To contact the reporter on this story:
