A unit of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Europe’s
biggest bank by assets, was sued in  New York  state court for
breach of contract by a trustee for a pool of  mortgage loans .  The trustee, HSBC Bank USA NA, sued yesterday in New York
State Supreme Court in Manhattan saying DB Structured Products
Inc. failed to “cure, substitute or repurchase” mortgages and
that the trust didn’t satisfy representations and warranties
about their origin and characteristics.  DB Structured securitized the loans and sold them to the
trust and chose more than 5,000 loans that are the primary
source of revenue for payments on the certificates issued by the
trust, according to the complaint. At least 2,375 of the loans
breached the representations and warranties, the trustee said.  “Even after receiving exhaustively detailed descriptions
of each of the breaches from the trustee,” DB Structured
Products “has failed to cure a single breach or repurchase a
single loan,” the trustee said in the complaint. “Left with no
other option, the trustee now brings this action.”  Duncan King , a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank,
declined by e-mail to comment immediately on the lawsuit.  The case is Ace Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products
Inc., 650327/2013, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
