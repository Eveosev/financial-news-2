 Copper exports surged 27 percent
last year to the highest level since 2009 amid a decline in
domestic demand as users from  Sony Corp. (6758)  to  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) 
increased production overseas.  Shipments climbed to 512,277 metric tons from 402,114 tons
in 2011 and compared with a record 589,260 tons in 2009,
according to finance ministry  data  today.  Manufacturers moved production abroad after the  yen  reached
a post-World War II high in October 2011, making their exports
less competitive. Rising costs at home accelerated the trend as
 Tokyo Electric Power Co. (5411)  increased electricity charges because
of higher energy imports after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.  Copper production rose 14 percent in 2012 from a year
earlier while demand slumped 12 percent, according to data from
Pan Pacific Copper Co., the biggest producer.  Export markets include  China ,  Taiwan ,  Malaysia ,  Indonesia 
and  Thailand . Producers also include  Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. (5713) ,
 Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711) , Dowa Holdings Co. and Furukawa
Metals & Resources Co., a unit of Furukawa Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
