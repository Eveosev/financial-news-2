Pacific Investment Management Co.,
the world’s largest manager of actively run bond funds, has
appointed Marc Seidner as interim head of global equities after
Neel Kashkari’s departure last week, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  Seidner, a senior member of Pimco’s portfolio management
group and managing director, started overseeing the firm’s stock
unit Jan. 25, said the person who asked not to be identified
because the information isn’t public. Before joining Pimco in
2009, Seidner was a domestic fixed-income portfolio manager at
Harvard Management Co., which oversees the university’s
endowment. Kashkari said in an e-mail Jan. 23 he was leaving
Pimco to consider returning to public service.  Pimco, based in Newport Beach,  California , has been seeking
to reduce its dependence on fixed income as it anticipates an
end to the three-decade bond rally that fueled its growth.
Pimco, which oversees $1.9 trillion in assets, has attracted
about $10 billion to the equity unit since the first fund was
opened in April 2010. Three of the firm’s four main stock funds
trailed a majority of rivals in 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The Wall Street Journal reported the appointment earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
