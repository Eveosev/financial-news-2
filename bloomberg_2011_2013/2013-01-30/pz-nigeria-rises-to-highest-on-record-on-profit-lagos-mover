PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc (PZ) , a consumer
products manufacturer, touched a record high after it said
first-half profit almost doubled.  The stock gained as much as 9 percent to 35 naira, the
highest price on record on a closing basis, before retreating to
32.20 naira by 1:08 p.m. in Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital.
A close at this will be its highest on a closing basis since
Aug. 16, 2011. About 92 percent of the three-month daily average
traded, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income for the six months through November jumped to
1.5 billion naira ($9.5 million) from 786 million naira a year
earlier, the Lagos-based company said in a statement published
on the website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange . Revenue fell to
31 billion naira from 32.3 billion naira.  PZ’s sales “were broadly in line” with estimates, Lagos-
based FBN Capital said today in an e-mailed note to clients.
Margins were boosted by a 29 percent decline in the price of
crude  palm oil , a major raw material for its products, according
to the Lagos-based brokerage. This compensated “to a large
extent” for the impact on sales of higher fuel prices with the
partial end of subsidies, the Islamist insurgency in the north
and the floods that swept large parts of the country, it said.  PZ shares have advanced 15 percent this year, compared with
a 13 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
