Malaysia’s ringgit rose for the
first time in three days as speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
maintain monetary stimulus at a policy meeting today spurred
demand for emerging-market assets. Government bonds advanced.  The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of shares climbed for a second
day after U.S. stocks extended their best start to a year since
1989, buoyed by earnings reports from companies including Pfizer
Inc. The Fed’s latest round of bond buying is forecast to reach
$1.14 trillion before it ends the program in the first quarter
of 2014, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Malaysia’s central bank will keep the benchmark overnight policy
rate at 3 percent at a review tomorrow, all 22 economists in a
Bloomberg survey forecast.  “Market sentiment is better today and U.S. earnings were
strong,” said  Nizam Idris , head of Asian fixed-income and
foreign-exchange strategy at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore.
“The  Federal Open Market Committee  is likely to say they will
maintain the current program.”  The ringgit advanced 0.1 percent to 3.0785 per dollar as of
4:19 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, trimming this month’s loss to 0.7
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysian
financial markets were shut Jan. 24 and Jan. 28 for holidays.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, held at 6.22 percent.  The yield on the 3.314 percent sovereign notes due October
2017 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.21
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
