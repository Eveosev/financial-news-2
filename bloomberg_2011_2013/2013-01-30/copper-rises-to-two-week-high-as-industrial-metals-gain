Copper climbed to the highest price
in more than two weeks after U.S. housing data boosted optimism
that demand was recovering in the second largest consumer. Zinc,
lead and aluminum advanced.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.7
percent to $8,159 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the
most expensive since Jan. 11, and traded at $8,151 at 11:24 a.m.
Shanghai time. The May contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
added 0.7 percent to 59,280  yuan  ($9,530) a ton.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values increased 5.5
percent from November 2011, the biggest year-over-year gain
since August 2006. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s
latest round of bond buying will reach $1.14 trillion before he
ends the program in the first quarter of 2014, according to
median estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  “Market confidence is improving as the global economy is
expected to be better,” Lu Minsu, an analyst at New Century
Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “An improvement in
copper’s own fundamentals are needed for a further rally.”  LME copper  inventories  jumped 9 percent to 371,750 tons
yesterday, the highest level in more than 13 months, data from
the bourse showed. Metal for delivery in March on the Comex in
New York gained 0.4 percent to $3.7050 per pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
