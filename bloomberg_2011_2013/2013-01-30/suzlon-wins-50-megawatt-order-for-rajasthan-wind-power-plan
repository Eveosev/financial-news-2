Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ,  India ’s largest
wind-turbine maker, said it won an order to build and operate a
50.4 megawatt wind power plant in India’s western state of
Rajasthan.  The company will install 24 units of its 2.1-megawatt S88
turbine for New Delhi-based Orange Renewable Power, it said in
an e-mailed statement, without giving the value of the order.  Suzlon’s lenders last week approved a 95-billion rupee
($1.78 billion) debt restructuring plan, which will help bring
down the company’s debt repayment costs. Suzlon on Oct. 11
failed to pay $209 million, the biggest convertible note default
by an Indian company.  Shares rose as much as 2.6 percent to 21.6 rupees. The
stock has declined 26 percent in the past year, compared with a
16 percent increase in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  Worldwide wind turbine installations will probably stall in
2013 as policy uncertainty, financing difficulties and delayed
grid connections affect projects, Suzlon Chairman Tulsi R. Tanti
said on Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
