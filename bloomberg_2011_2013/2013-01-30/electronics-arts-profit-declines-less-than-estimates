Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , the second-
largest U.S. video-game maker, declined in extended trading
after the company’s forecast for fourth-quarter sales fell short
of analysts’ projections.  The shares fell 1.5 percent to $14.85 in late trading
yesterday, after closing at $15.08 in  New York . Adjusted revenue
in the fourth quarter ending March 31 will be about $1.03
billion to $1.13 billion, the  Redwood City , California-based
company said in a  statement  yesterday. Analysts on average
predicted sales of $1.22 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Electronic Arts, like other game producers, is trying to
offer more products and updates online to counter shrinking
consumer spending on packaged titles for home consoles. Digital
revenue rose 8 percent to $407 million in the third quarter,
helped by $100 million from its “FIFA 13” soccer title.  “Based on Christmas, we’re a little bit worried about how
strong the consumer market is,” Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said in an interview yesterday. The company lowered
its forecast amid the industry slump in console sales, he said.  Adjusted fourth-quarter profit will be about 57 cents to 72
cents a share, the company said in the statement, compared with
the 72 cent-average projection by analysts.  Electronic Arts has several big-budget releases of packaged
games scheduled for the current quarter, including “Dead Space
3,” “Crysis 3” and a new “Sims” title.  Digital Revenue  The company posted fiscal third-quarter profit that
declined less than analysts estimated, helped by higher-margin
digital revenue. Profit excluding some items shrank to 57 cents
a share, compared to the average analyst estimate of 56 cents.
Sales, excluding changes in deferred revenue, fell 28 percent to
$1.18 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, missing the $1.29
billion average.  Its net loss in the third quarter narrowed to $45 million,
or 15 cents a share, from $205 million, or 62 cents, a year
earlier.  For the fiscal year ending in March, Electronic Arts said
adjusted profit would be about 86 cents to $1 a share on sales
of about $3.78 billion to $3.88 billion. Analysts projected
adjusted profit of $1.02 a share on sales of $4.08 billion. In
October, the company forecast profit of about $1 to $1.15 a
share on revenue of about $4.05 billion to $4.20 billion.  Electronic Arts has declined 16 percent in the year through
yesterday, compared with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which
has gained 14 percent, and  Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) , its bigger
competitor, which has declined 7.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
