As north  China  chokes on  toxic smog ,
a Chinese entrepreneur is offering a solution: canned air.  Millionaire Chen Guangbiao is selling fresh air in soft
drink cans for 5  yuan  (80 cents) a pop. The air comes in  flavors 
including “Pristine Tibet,” “Post-industrial Taiwan” and
“Revolutionary Yan’an.” A portion of the proceeds will go to
charity, the International Business Times  reports .  Chen, who  began selling  the canned air in September,
told  ABC News  the effort was to raise awareness about the need
for environmental protection in China. The philanthropist has
also recently given away 5,000  bicycles  to encourage people to
bike instead of drive.  His message comes as China faces  dangerous levels  of air
pollution. At the U.S. Embassy in Beijing,  air quality  reached
hazardous levels on Tuesday for the 19th in 25 days, prompting
canceled flights and warnings for people to stay indoors.  The concentration of PM2.5, fine air particulates that pose
a health risk, averaged 300 micrograms per cubic meter Tuesday.
PM2.5 levels had reached a record 755 on Jan. 12. The  World
Health Organization  recommends exposure to no higher than 25
micrograms per cubic meter over a 24-hour period.  In face of such pollution, Chen’s cans of air -- and
 videos  of people “drinking” them -- may seem like a silly
antidote to the larger problem of high emissions in China and
the far-reaching environmental effects. But it can’t be sillier
than a  “clean water” bar  in  New York  City.  (Kirsten Salyer is the social media editor for Bloomberg
