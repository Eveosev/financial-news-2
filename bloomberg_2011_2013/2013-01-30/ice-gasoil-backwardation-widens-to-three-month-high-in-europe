Front-month gasoil’s premium to the
second month contract, or backwardation, widened to the most in
three months as European inventories of the heating fuel
remained below the five-year average.  February gasoil traded as much as $11.75 more than March
today on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in  London . That’s the
biggest spread since Oct. 30. The difference was at $10.50 as of
12:08 p.m. local time. The market structure can signal rising
demand or falling supplies in the near term.  “Stocks are very tight in all key regions,”  Mike Wittner ,
head of oil-market research at Societe Generale SA in New York,
said in a note today.  Gasoil supplies held in independent storage in Europe’s
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region were below the five-year
average this month, according to PJK International BV, a
researcher based in the Netherlands. Inventories rose 9 percent
to 2.4 million tons in the week to Jan. 24 and compares with the
five-year average of 2.5 million, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
