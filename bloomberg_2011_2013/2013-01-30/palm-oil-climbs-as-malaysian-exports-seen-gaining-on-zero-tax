Palm oil rallied to the highest
level in almost three months on speculation that exports from
 Malaysia , the second-largest producer, will probably increase
after  Indonesia  set higher taxes on February shipments.  The contract for delivery in April climbed 1.4 percent to
2,510 ringgit ($813) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest price at close for the most-active
contract since Nov. 1. Futures, 3 percent higher in January, are
heading for the biggest monthly advance since March.  Indonesia, the biggest producer, will  raise  taxes on crude
exports to 9 percent for February from 7.5 percent in January,
the Trade Ministry said Jan. 28. Malaysia has said it will
maintain a zero-tariff policy for a second month in February to
help clear record stockpiles of the oil used in foods and fuels.  “The Indonesian tax increase will benefit Malaysian
palm,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Mumbai-based
Commtrendz Risk Management Services Pvt. “There’s zero export
tax in Malaysia, so there’ll be incentive for Malaysian
exporters to export more.”  China ’s oilseed imports may climb to a record 65.3 million
tons in the year through September 2013 from 63.1 million tons
in 2011-2012, while vegetable oil and fat imports may gain to
10.8 million tons from 9.98 million tons, Oil World, the
Hamburg, Germany-based researcher wrote in a report yesterday.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September advanced 0.8
percent to close at 7,072  yuan  ($1,137) a ton on the Dalian
Commodity Exchange. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month
increased 0.6 percent to end at 8,734 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $14.575
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for March
delivery gained 0.4 percent to 51.92 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
