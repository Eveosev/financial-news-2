Sudan  must investigate claims that
its security forces played a role in tribal fighting over gold-
mining rights in the western region of  Darfur  that left as many
as 200 people dead, Amnesty International said.  Fighting began Jan. 5 between members of Beni Hussein and
Rizeigat tribes over rival claims to a gold-rich area in Beni
Hussein territory in northern Darfur, the London-based human-
rights group said today in a  statement . Local residents said the
instigators of the violence included officers of the Border
Intelligence Brigade, part of Sudan’s military intelligence,
according to Amnesty.  “The Sudanese government should immediately investigate
the reports that its security officers are involved in attacks
against civilians and ensure they are not involved in any
further attacks,” Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty’s Africa director,
said in the statement.  The fighting left more than 100 dead and forced more than
70,000 civilians to flee their homes, the  United Nations said 
Jan. 16. One witness said 53 residents of Martam Bay village
were killed on Jan. 9 by a group that included border guards,
according to Amnesty.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Al-Obeid Murawih said the
ministry normally didn’t comment on reports by Amnesty. “Our
policy in the foreign office is only to comment on UN reports,”
he said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
