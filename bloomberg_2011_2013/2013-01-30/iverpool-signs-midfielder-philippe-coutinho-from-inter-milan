Liverpool signed Brazilian
midfielder Philippe Coutinho from Inter Milan, the Premier
League soccer club said on its website.  Coutinho signed a “long-term” deal, Liverpool said
without disclosing financial details. The transfer fee was
8.5 million pounds ($13.4 million), according to the Daily
Telegraph.  “We’ve always heard about Liverpool’s history in  Brazil ,”
 said  the 20-year-old, who’s made one appearance for the
Brazilian national team. “They are the club that have been
interested in me and that have showed this interest so I know
they believe in me and my football.”  Coutinho scored five goals in 47 matches at Inter after
joining from Brazil’s Vasco da Gama in 2010. He also spent time
on loan at Spanish club Espanyol last year.  Coutinho is Liverpool’s second signing of the January
transfer period, which ends tomorrow at 11 p.m. U.K. time, after
striker Daniel Sturridge joined from Chelsea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
