PSA Peugeot Citroen bonds led
declines in European junk-rated securities after the company was
ordered to halt restructuring plans while car workers strike
over job losses.  Peugeot’s 6 percent bonds due 2033 dropped 3 percent to
83.96 cents on the euro at 10:59 a.m. in  London  and have lost 8
percent this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, the
biggest weekly decline since December 2008. Bonds of  Seat Pagine
Gialle SpA (PG) , Italy’s largest directory publisher, extended losses
after the company suspended a coupon payment.  French auto workers are striking as Peugeot and  Renault SA (RNO) 
seek to eliminate 18,700 jobs, about 17 percent of their
workforces, as sales slump for a sixth year. Peugeot’s banking
unit completed about 5.3 billion euros ($7.1 billion) in loan
agreements Jan. 14 as part of a refinancing plan aimed at
stemming the effects of a sales drop.  “The restructuring is a good step towards improving
profitability as excess capacity in  France  has been a problem
for many years,” said Peter Kwaak, a  fund manager  at Robeco
Groep NV in Rotterdam, who oversees 12 billion euros in
corporate bonds. “But such a process is always difficult,
especially in France.”  Credit-default swaps protecting Peugeot’s debt for five
years rose 41 basis points this week to 723, the highest since
Nov. 30.  Renault Bonds  Renault’s 4.625 percent bonds due 2017 fell 0.2 percent to
101.68 euro cents, Bloomberg data show. French autoparts maker
 Faurecia (EO)  SA’s 9.375 percent notes due 2016 dropped 0.6 percent
to 112.65 euro cents, the lowest since November 21. The company
is  57 percent-owned  by Peugeot.  Seat Pagine’s 10.5 percent notes due 2017 declined 0.2
percent to 39 euro cents, after dropping 31 percent yesterday,
Bloomberg data show. The company said it’s going to suspend a 42
million-euro coupon payment on senior secured bonds as it
reviews its business plan.  Bondholders accepted a 1.28 billion-euro debt-for-equity
swap last march and credit-default swaps linked to Seat Pagine’s
debt were settled at an auction in December 2011 after a
failure-to-pay  credit event .  In the new issue market,  Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO)  is selling the lowest-rated bonds from a company
in  Europe ’s periphery in at least seven years, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It will price five-year benchmark bonds in euros
to yield 8 percent to 8.25 percent, a person with knowledge of
the deal said.  Credit Derivatives  The company has a Caa1  rating  from Moody’s Investors
Service, seven steps below investment grade. Speculative-grade,
or junk, debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service
and BBB- by Fitch and  Standard & Poor’s .  In derivatives markets, the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index
of credit-default swaps on 50 companies with mostly high-yield
ratings rose four basis points to 436. The Markit iTraxx Europe
Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings added 1.5
basis points to 110.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on 25 banks and
insurers was up two at 142.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
