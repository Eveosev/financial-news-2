ADT Corp. (ADT)  rose to the highest price
since its September spinoff from  Tyco International Ltd. (TYC)  after
saying it would accelerate a share repurchase program backed by
billionaire  George Soros , one of ADT’s shareholders.  The security provider’s shares rose 3.2 percent to $48 at
the New York close, the highest since Boca Raton, Florida-based
ADT began trading as a separate company on Sept. 18. ADT said
today it will buy back $600 million in stock.  Soros and ADT’s largest shareholder, Keith Meister of
Corvex Management LP, had urged the company to boost shareholder
returns by buying back about 45 percent of its stock with
borrowed money, citing low  interest rates . ADT will use the
proceeds from a recently completed debt offering, according to a
statement.  The share repurchases are “a very effective way of using
our additional leverage to enhance shareholder returns,” ADT
Chief Executive Officer Naren Gursahaney said today on a
conference call.  The accelerated buybacks are part of a previous
authorization announced in November to repurchase $2 billion in
shares and will be completed by July 26 or earlier, the company
said.  ADT also reported fiscal first-quarter earnings today that
beat analysts’ estimates. Profit excluding special items was 44
cents a share for the three months ended Dec. 28,  topping  the
42-cent average estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Net income
jumped 13 percent to $105 million, while total revenue rose 1.8
percent to $809 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
