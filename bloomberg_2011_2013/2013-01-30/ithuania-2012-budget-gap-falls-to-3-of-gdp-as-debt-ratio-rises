Lithuania’s budget deficit narrowed
to 3 percent of gross domestic product last year, meeting
European Union limits for the first time since 2007 even as
government debt advanced.  The shortfall shrank from 4.8 percent last year on revenue
of 32.4 billion litai ($12.7 billion) and spending of 34.1
billion litai, the  Finance Ministry , based in the capital,
Vilnius, said today on its website. Taxes and social-security
payments generated 47 percent and 38 percent of revenue, while
social-benefits expenditures such as pensions and unemployment
accounted for 51 percent of spending, it said.  Government debt rose to 43.2 billion litai, equivalent to
38.4 percent of GDP, 2 percentage points more than in 2011, the
ministry said in a separate statement.  Lithuania’s  economy  grew 3.6 percent in 2012, faster than
the Finance Ministry’s forecast of 3.5 percent, the statistics
office said today. The four-party coalition formed after
elections in October adopted a budget for 2013 that foresees
reducing the deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP. The government plans
to seek euro adoption in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
