Ethanol production in the U.S. fell
to a record low after distillers slowed output or shut money-
losing plants, a government report showed.  Output dropped 2.8 percent to 770,000 barrels a day, the
Energy Information Administration said today. It was the lowest
level since the Energy Department’s analytical arm began
tracking weekly data in June 2010. Stockpiles gained 2.3 percent
to 20.5 million barrels, the most in six weeks.  Ethanol companies across the grain-rich Midwest, including
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , Poet LLC, and White Energy Inc., have
reduced production and closed plants in the face of record corn
prices caused by the worst U.S. drought since the 1930s. Corn is
the main ingredient of U.S. ethanol.  Imports plunged to 9,000 barrels a day from 67,000 the
previous week. That’s the lowest level since Nov. 16, the report
showed. Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 87 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, down from 88 percent in the week
ended Jan. 18.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 2.9 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.434 a gallon at 11:09 a.m.  New York  time on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest price since Nov. 28. The
futures Prices have advanced 11 percent this year and are
heading toward the first monthly gain since October.  Corn for March delivery gained 6.5 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $7.36 a bushel in  Chicago  after touching $7.39, the highest
price for a most-active contract since Dec. 7. One bushel makes
at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 23 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that
can be fed to livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
