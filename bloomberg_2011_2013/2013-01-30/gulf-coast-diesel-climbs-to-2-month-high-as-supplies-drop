Diesel fuel on the U.S.  Gulf Coast 
strengthened to a two-month high versus futures and gasoline
strengthened for a second day as fuel supplies declined.  Stockpiles of distillates, including diesel and heating
oil, in PADD 3 fell 125,000 barrels to 40.3 million in the week
ended Jan. 25, snapping a five-week advance, according to the
Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department. Inventories of motor fuel slid 716,000
barrels to 82.1 million last  week .  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel on the Gulf gained 3.38 cents
to 1.13 cents a gallon over heating oil futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 1:48 p.m., the highest level since Nov.
27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Reformulated 
gasoline  to be blended with ethanol, or RBOB, in the region rose
1.5 cents to 13 cents below Nymex gasoline futures.  Alon USA Partners LP (ALDW) ’s Big Spring and  Western Refining
Inc. (WNR) ’s El Paso refineries in Texas plan to begin scheduled work
next month, further drawing from supplies in the U.S. Gulf
Coast.  Alon will conduct maintenance on a vacuum unit and replace
a catalyst in a reformer and diesel hydrotreater for 10 days in
February, while Western plans to shut a portion of its 128,000-
barrel-a-day  El Paso plant , the companies said.  New York Harbor  The  3-2-1 crack  spread on the Gulf Coast, a measure of
refining profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in
Cushing and spot prices for diesel and gasoline, rose $1.69 to
$25.21 a barrel, the highest since Dec. 25. The same spread for
 Light Louisiana Sweet oil  grew $1.29 to $7.31 a barrel.  The same spread in  New York  Harbor, based on Brent oil in
 Europe , advanced $1.44 to $13.54, a third consecutive gain. RBOB
in the New York gained 0.63 cent to 0.25 cent below futures as
the flow of European gasoline to the U.S. East Coast was poised
to decline in the two weeks to Feb. 6.  The gap between New York and Gulf Coast RBOB narrowed to
13.34 cents a gallon, compared with minus 1.9 cents a year ago.  Traders and oil companies will book 24 tankers to load the
fuel, according to the median estimate in a survey of seven ship
brokers and traders specializing in the trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
