Two former Clear One Health Plans
Inc. technology specialists agreed to pay $154,000 to settle
claims they traded on nonpublic information about a company
takeover, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said.  Daniel Vance, 40, of Bend, Oregon, and Blake Wellington,
46, of Hillsboro, Oregon, learned in 2009 that Clear One was
involved in merger talks with PacificSource Health Plans and
used the information to buy Clear One shares, the SEC said in an
e-mail.  Clear One’s share price jumped 150 percent when the merger
was announced in December 2009, and the men reaped $70,000 in
profit, the SEC said.  Wellington disgorged his $56,000 profit and paid a penalty
of an equal amount. Vance did the same with this $17,500 in
profit. Neither admitted or denied the allegations.  In an e-mail, William Kimball, an attorney for Vance,
declined to comment on the settlement. Christopher Cooke, an
attorney for Wellington, didn’t immediately return a voice-mail
message seeking comment.  The case is SEC v. Vance, 13-172, U.S. District Court,
District of Oregon (Eugene).  To contact the reporter on this story:
