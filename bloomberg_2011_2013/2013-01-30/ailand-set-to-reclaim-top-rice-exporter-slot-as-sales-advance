Rice shipments from Thailand are
poised to surge 15 percent this year to help the country win
back the top-exporter slot as the government accelerates sales
from its record stockpiles, an industry group said.  Exports may climb to 8 million metric tons this calendar
year, assuming sales of 1.5 million tons from state inventories,
from 6.95 million tons in 2012, said the  Thai Rice Exporters
Association . India and Vietnam sold more than Thailand last year
as shipments tumbled 35 percent to the lowest level since 2000,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Rice, the staple for half the world, has dropped 16 percent
from a three-year high in September 2011 as inventories tracked
by the United Nations’ Food & Agriculture Organization swell to
a record, curbing  food costs . Thailand started buying rough rice
from farmers above market rates in October 2011, to lift
domestic prices and rural incomes.  “The 8-million-ton target will be achieved as the
government has to speed up government-to-government sales,” the
group’s president Korbsook Iamsuri, told reporters in Bangkok.
Thailand has around 17 million tons of milled rice in stockpiles,
the group estimates.  The government has bought 9 million tons of unmilled rice
and expects to purchase as much as 11 million tons this harvest,
Commerce Minister Boonsong Teriyapirom said Jan. 23. The country
will maintain an export target of 8.5 million tons for this year,
according to the Department of Foreign Trade.  “Thailand will be more aggressive in terms of exporting
the rice,” Samarendu Mohanty, a senior economist at the
International Rice Research Institute, said in an e-mail dated
yesterday. “It has no other choice.”  Strong Currency  The strength of Thailand’s currency against the dollar,
reducing the appeal of shipments from the country, may hamper
rice sales, Korbsook said. The Thai baht has gained 2.7 percent
this month, the second-best exchange-rate performance in Asia
after the Indian rupee.  “A sharp rise in baht in recent weeks has made buyers
hesitant to place orders as the price in dollar terms has
increased,” Korbsook said. “This is a key obstacle in addition
to the state purchase program, which has raised costs.”  Stockpiles in Thailand will climb to a record 11.7 million
tons in the 2012-2013 season, according to the USDA, which
estimates Thai export at 8 million tons, followed by India at
7.5 million tons and Vietnam at 7.4 million tons.  World output of milled rice in 2012-2013 is forecast at an
all-time high of 465.6 million tons, according to the USDA. The
FAO has forecast global reserves climbing to 169.8 million tons
by the end of 2012-2013.  Rice for March delivery was unchanged at $15.525 per 100
pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade at 4:24 p.m. Singapore time.
Price of 5-percent Thai white variety was at $599 a ton,
compared with $430 from India and $390 from Vietnam, data from
the exporters’ association showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
