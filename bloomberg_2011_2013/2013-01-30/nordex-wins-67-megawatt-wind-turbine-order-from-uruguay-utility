Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German turbine maker,
won an order to supply the largest wind farm built by  Uruguay ’s
Administracion Nacional de Usinas & Transmisiones Electricas.  Nordex will deliver, install and maintain 28 of its 2.4-
megawatt machines at the Juan Pablo Terra project near Uruguay’s
border with  Brazil , the company said today in a statement. Each
turbine will be able to power about 3,500 homes, it said.  Nordex rose as much as 4.1 percent to 3.986 euros in
Frankfurt trading, and was at 3.95 euros as of 9:07 a.m. local
time.  Delivery to Uruguay’s state-owned utility will begin in
February 2014, with completion of the 67-megawatt project
scheduled for June that year, according to Hamburg-based Nordex.
The contract follows a 50-megawatt Uruguayan order from Akuo
Energy SAS earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
