Spain’s monthly wind-power output
exceeded 6 terawatt-hours for the first time this month, enough
to light most households, the nation’s wind lobby group said.  The milestone was passed yesterday from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.
local time, the Spanish Wind Energy Association said today in an
e-mailed statement, citing data from Red Electrica de Espana,
the grid operator.  “Since Nov. 1, wind has been the top technology in the
electrical system,” the lobby group said in a  blog  posting.
“The last time any technology exceeded 6 terawatt-hours of
monthly generation was in 2010, when it was combined-cycle gas
turbines.”  Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Acciona SA (ANA)  and other wind operators have
built plants in Spain as the government seeks to meet energy
demand without adding to emissions. The country is ranked fourth
in the world in terms of installed wind power, after the U.S.,
 Germany  and  China , according to the industry association.  Wind generation this month totaled 6.214 terawatt-hours as
of 9:49 a.m. local time today, representing more than a quarter
of Spain’s total power output, according to Red Electrica’s
 website . That puts it ahead of nuclear and coal-fired
electricity, the figures show.  Wind has accounted for more power than any other energy
source in the three months ending tomorrow, a first for any
quarter, the wind association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
