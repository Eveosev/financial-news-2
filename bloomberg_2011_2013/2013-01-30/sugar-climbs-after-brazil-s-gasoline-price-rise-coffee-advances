Sugar climbed on speculation that
millers in Brazil, the world’s largest producer, will direct
more cane to ethanol production after a gasoline price rise in
the South American nation. Coffee and cocoa fell.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, will raise gasoline prices at refineries by 6.6
percent, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing dated yesterday. That may boost ethanol consumption, as
most cars can run on both a mixture of gasoline and ethanol as
well as on pure biofuel.  The increase is “positive for sugar as there will be more
demand for ethanol, which is a huge sector in Brazil,” Edward de Wismes, an agricultural futures broker at Aurel BGC in Paris,
said by e-mail today. “It’s likely that millers will direct
more cane to ethanol instead of sugar.”  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 1.8 percent to settle at
18.71 cents a pound at 1:46 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. The commodity has slumped 22 percent in the past year on
forecasts for a surplus in supply as output in  Brazil  increases.  “The sugar sector would have liked something more, but
right now they will take what they can get,” Michael McDougall,
the head of the Brazil desk at Newedge Group in New York, said
today in a report.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery fell 1.4 percent
to $1.477 a pound on ICE, snapping a three-session advance.  Cocoa futures for March delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
$2,179 a metric ton in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
