World Bank President Jim Yong Kim
said that corruption is hampering the bank’s efforts to help
developing countries grow, and promised to fight against its
“pernicious toll.”  “Corruption acts as a regressive tax, penalizing poorer
citizens and smaller firms,” Kim said in remarks prepared for
delivery today at the  Center for Strategic and International
Studies  in Washington. “We need to be focused more upon solving
real-world problems than the traditional ’best practice’ model
of institutional development.”  Between $20 billion and $40 billion is stolen from
developing countries each year by one  estimate , said Kim, a
former Dartmouth College president who took over as head of the
Washington-based World Bank in July. He said the bank has closed
609 misconduct investigations in the past four and a half years.  The World Bank started an alliance between national level
anti-corruption agencies, prosecutors and auditors in 2010, Kim
said. It is now developing software to help spot corruption in
public procurement. “Our willingness to work in difficult
situations and an appetite for measured risk should never be
confused with a willingness to tolerate corruption in Bank
projects and activities.”  The World Bank has  188 member countries  and committed $57
billion in 2011 to projects from building roads to taking stakes
in companies in emerging economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
