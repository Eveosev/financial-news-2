Oil traded near the highest level in
more than four months before a Federal Reserve policy statement
that may signal the U.S. central bank will take additional steps
to stimulate the economy of the world’s biggest crude user.  West Texas Intermediate rose as much as 0.7 percent to the
highest since Sept. 17, and pared gains after the U.S. economy
contracted in the fourth quarter. Crude is poised for a third
monthly gain, the longest run since April 2011. The Federal Open
Market Committee will renew its commitment to purchasing assets
during a two-day meeting, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
 Economic confidence  in the euro area rose more than economists
forecast in January.  “We would expect a status-quo announcement from the Fed
with an acknowledgement that the outlook has improved
slightly,” said Guy Wolf, a strategist at London-based
commodities broker Marex Spectron Group Ltd., who predicts
European benchmark Brent crude will trade from $100 a barrel to
$125 in the next month. “The U.S. economy is clearly strong,
but the employment numbers are not so good that a Fed exit is
imminent.”  WTI for March rose as high as $98.24, and was 14 cents
higher at $97.71 in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 1:52 p.m. London time. The volume of all
futures traded was 35 percent above the 100-day average. Oil has
gained 6 percent this month.  Fed Meeting  Brent for March settlement rose above $115 a barrel for the
first time since Oct. 16, advancing as much as 88 cents, or 0.8
percent to $115.24 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The volume of all futures traded was 22 percent above
the 100-day average. The European benchmark grade was at a
premium of $16.94 to WTI futures, from $16.79 yesterday.  U.S. gross domestic product dropped at a 0.1 percent annual
rate, weaker than any economist forecast in a Bloomberg survey
and the worst performance since the second quarter of 2009,
Commerce Department figures showed.  The FOMC will renew its policy of purchasing assets after
determining that the benefits from the program exceed any risk
of inflation or financial instability, according to the survey
of economists last week.  An  index  of European executive and consumer sentiment rose
to 89.2 from a revised 87.8 in December, the European Commission
in Brussels said today. That’s the highest since June.
Economists had forecast an increase to 88.2, according to the
median of 30 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  U.S. Inventories  U.S. crude stockpiles  rose  for a fourth week by 4.2 million
barrels to 368.2 million last week, the highest level in more
than a month, the industry-funded API said yesterday. The Energy
Information Administration report today may show supplies
increased by  2.5 million barrels , according to the median
estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The EIA reports
oil-supply figures today.  Inventories of  gasoline  probably advanced by 1 million
barrels, while  distillates , which include diesel and heating
oil, dropped 500,000 barrels, according to the survey.  China , the world’s second-largest oil consumer, will
increase its crude imports this year by 7.3 percent, the biggest
gain since 2010, according to the median estimate of five
analysts in a survey. Net imports were a record 5.4 million
barrels a day in 2012, customs data show. Shipments climbed 6.9
percent last year and 6.3 percent in 2011.  The nation, which imports about half its crude, will boost
oil consumption by 4 percent to 9.98 million barrels a day this
year, the International Energy Agency forecast in its Monthly
Oil Market report on Jan. 18. U.S. demand will stay unchanged at
18.7 million barrels a day, the IEA said.  Oil may extend its rally in New York after a “golden
cross” formed. The 50-day moving average, at $90.70 a barrel
today, climbed above the 100-day mean and pared its discount to
the 200-day indicator to 30 cents, the smallest gap since June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors typically buy
when a moving average rises over a longer-term one. Crude’s 14-
day relative strength index is higher than 70 for a second day,
signaling the advance may stall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
