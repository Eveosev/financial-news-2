Atoss Software AG (AOF)  rose to the
highest level in more than 12 years after the German company
agreed to pay a special dividend.  Atoss jumped 14 percent to 25 euros at 10:18 a.m. in
Frankfurt in the stockâ€™s steepest increase since September 2009,
reaching the highest price since November 2000. Trading volume
was five times the three-month daily average.  Founder Andreas Obereder owns about half of the Munich-
based software maker, which has a market value of 99 million
euros ($134 million) and whose products help companies manage
their workforce. Based on the 3.62-euro per-share dividend
announced late yesterday, including a 2.90-euro one-time payout,
Obereder stands to receive about 7.2 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
