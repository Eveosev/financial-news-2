Cobbetts LLP, which has nearly 500
employees in four offices, will become the first major U.K. law
firm to seek protection from creditors since 2010.  The firm, the 62nd-largest by revenue in the U.K., said the
weak economy led it to the decision to appoint administrators to
find a buyer.  “The appropriate course at this time is for the firm to
obtain the protection of an interim statutory moratorium to
enable a sale of the business,” Cobbetts said in an e-mailed
statement.  “We are in an environment where the legal market across
the U.K. looks pretty flat,” said Tony Williams, principal at
Jomati Consultants LLP. “Winners and losers are starting to
emerge and Cobbetts is a firm that was squeezed from all
sides.”  Halliwells LLP went into administration in 2010 in the face
of mounting debt and a string of failed merger discussions. U.S.
law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP filed for bankruptcy in May after
its chairman was ousted, almost all its partners quit and
creditors began suing for unpaid bills.  Cobbetts, known for its real estate and mid-market
corporate work, had revenue of 45.4 million pounds ($71.7
million) in the 2011-12 financial year, making it the 62nd-
largest U.K. law firm, according to Legal Business Magazine. The
firm had offices in Birmingham, Leeds,  London  and Manchester.  To contact the reporter on this story:
