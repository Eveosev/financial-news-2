The Slovak Finance Ministry cut its
forecasts for economic growth as the euro-regionâ€™s debt crisis
hurts exports and unemployment damps consumer demand.  Gross domestic product will probably  expand  1.2 percent
this year, down from 2.1 percent predicted in September, the
Bratislava-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement. The
growth outlook for next year was cut to 2.9 percent from 3.5
percent, while for 2015 it was revised down to 3.3 percent from
3.6 percent.  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, relies on demand
from western  Europe  to maintain growth. Boosted last year by an
increase in car-industry capacity, the economy faces a slowdown
as the debt crisis weakens demand for exports and unemployment
erodes purchasing power.  In 2012, the economy probably expanded 2.3 percent, the
ministry said, revising its previous 2.5 percent estimate.  A slowing economy will help contain price growth, the
ministry said. The average inflation rate will fall to 2.3
percent this year, compared with a previous forecast of 3.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
