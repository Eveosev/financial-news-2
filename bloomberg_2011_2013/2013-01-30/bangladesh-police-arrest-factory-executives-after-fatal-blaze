Bangladesh  police arrested the
chairman and managing director of Smart Export Garments Ltd.
after a fire last week killed seven workers at the Dhaka factory
that made clothes for international brands.  Mohammad Sharif, chairman, and Zakir Ahmed, managing
director, were arrested after the father of a worker who
died in the fire sued three top company officials, police
spokesman Masudur Rahman said today via phone.   Garments from  Inditex SA (ITX) ’s Bershka and Lefties brands were
found in the wreckage, the Institute for Global Labour and  Human
Rights  said on its website.  The blaze was the second major fire at a Bangladesh
clothing factory in two months and is prompting labor groups to
renew calls for better conditions at factories supplying the
world’s biggest brands. More than 100 people were killed on Nov.
24 at a local plant producing clothes for companies including
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  Inditex, the world’s largest clothing retailer, said it
stopped doing business with two subcontractors after garments
with the company’s labels were found at the site of a fatal
factory fire in Bangladesh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
