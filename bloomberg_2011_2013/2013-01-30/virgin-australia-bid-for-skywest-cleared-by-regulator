Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. (VAH) , the
nation’s second largest carrier, was cleared by the antitrust
regulator to proceed with its takeover of  Skywest Airlines Ltd. (SKYW) 
for about A$96 million ($100 million).  The deal probably won’t lead to a “substantial lessening
of competition” as the airlines have only one route that
overlaps with each other, the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission said in a statement today. A ruling on
Virgin’s bid for control of the local unit of budget carrier
 Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd. (TGR)  will be released Feb. 7, it said.  The Skywest approval will allow Virgin to take control of
its regional routes and advance plans to take on  Qantas Airways
Ltd. (QAN) , which has a 65 percent share of the Australian domestic
market.  “The message that we received from the market was broadly
supportive of the proposed acquisition,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims
said in a statement. “The services that Virgin and Skywest
supply are seen as largely complementary, rather than
competitive with each other.”  Virgin’s cash and stock-based offer values Skywest shares
at 45 Australian cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
