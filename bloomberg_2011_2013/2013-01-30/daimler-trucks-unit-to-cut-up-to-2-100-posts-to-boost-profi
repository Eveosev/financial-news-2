Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s largest
truckmaker, plans to eliminate as many as 2,100 positions at its
commercial-vehicles unit to improve profitability.  Daimler is negotiating with the United Auto Workers union
to cut as many as 1,300 factory jobs in North America, Bernd Weber, a spokesman for the Stuttgart, Germany-based company,
said today in a telephone interview. The manufacturer will also
slash 800 non-production posts in  Germany , he said, confirming
comments that Andreas Renschler, who runs the division, made in
an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper.  Daimler, the world’s largest producer of commercial
vehicles by revenue, is lagging behind  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  and  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) ’s  Scania AB (SCVB)  in profitability. Renschler pledged last year to
close the margin gap to Daimler’s competitors after investors
questioned the rationale behind the combination of trucks and
Mercedes-Benz luxury cars in the same company.  Daimler produces commercial vehicles ranging from the Citan
delivery van to city buses to the long-haul Actros truck. The
truck division accounted for about 25 percent of Daimler’s 107
billion euros in revenue in 2011.  The German job cuts will be made through voluntary
departures, Weber said.  The shares closed down 1.2 percent at 43.55 euros in
Frankfurt trading today. The stock has risen 5.4 percent this
year, valuing the company at 46.5 billion euros ($63.1 billion).  To contact the reporters on this story:
