Meritor Inc. (MTOR)  plummeted the most in
14 months after the maker of axles and brakes for trucks and
buses cut its fiscal 2013 revenue forecast following a first-
quarter sales decline.  The  shares  fell 13 percent to $4.68 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day decline since Nov. 15, 2011. The Troy,
Michigan-based company’s stock declined 26 percent in the past
12 months, as the  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  rose 13 percent.  Meritor pared its revenue outlook for the year that ends in
September to $3.8 billion from a prior forecast of $4 billion,
according to a statement today. That trailed the $4.02 billion
average of six analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. First-
quarter revenue slid 23 percent to $891 million.  The sales were hurt by “weaker than expected market
conditions outside  North America ,” Chief Executive Officer Chip McClure said in the statement.  Meritor also reported that its first-quarter net loss
narrowed to $21 million, or 22 cents a share, from $22 million,
or 23 cents, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
