Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) 
fell the most in four months after Veja magazine reported that
 Brazil  may try to force airlines to cap some fare prices. Shares
pared losses after the government denied the report.  Shares slumped 3.2 percent to 14.52 reais at 4:54 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo  after earlier tumbling as much as 7.8 percent in the
steepest intraday decline since Oct. 2.  Brazil is considering changes at Congonhas airport
including a cap on fares for flights there, Veja reported
earlier without saying where it got the information. Brazil’s
civil aviation regulator Anac said through it’s press office
it’s unaware of any plan to limit airline ticket prices, easing
concern that the government would intervene in the sector.  The regulator can’t intervene in ticket prices because
Brazil has had a free rate policy since 2001, Anac said. It said
in the statement that it will publish a plan to revise rules for
distribution of the slots available for takeoffs and landings in
airports tomorrow, with the goal of removing those that aren’t
well used by airlines.  Gol has operated the most flights connecting Congonhas with
Brazil’s busiest airports since 2008, according to a statement
on the airline’s  website . A press official at Gol declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
