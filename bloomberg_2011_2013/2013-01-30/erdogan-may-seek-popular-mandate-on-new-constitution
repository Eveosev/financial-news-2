Turkey ’s ruling party may seek a
referendum on its proposal for a new constitution if parliament
fails to reach a consensus, Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
said in an address to his lawmakers.  Erdogan said he wants work on a new constitution finished
by the end of March.  “If not, the AK Party will carry its proposal to the
floor,” he said. The government would seek parliamentary
backing for a popular vote and “take it to the nation,”
Erdogan said.  Erdogan’s ruling  Justice and Development Party , known as AK
Party in Turkish, has 326 lawmakers in the 550-seat parliament
and would need at least four more votes to take a bill to a
referendum.  Erdogan said earlier this week that cooperation with
another party was possible.  Erdogan’s party is also pushing for a draft law giving the
president the power to issue decrees with the force of law,
dissolve parliament, call new elections and decide whether to
use military force.  Erdogan’s government has been trying to convince opposition
parties to change the constitution to pave the way for a
presidential system which he argues would speed up asset sales.  Turks for the first time will elect next president in
popular vote in August 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
