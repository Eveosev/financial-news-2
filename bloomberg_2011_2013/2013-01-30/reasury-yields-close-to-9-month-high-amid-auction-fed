Treasury yields traded close to the
highest level in nine months as investors await guidance from
the Federal Reserve on whether it will indicate a slowdown in
monetary stimulus at the conclusion of today’s policy meeting.  Yields rose as the U.S. sold $29 billion in seven-year
notes that drew a yield of 1.416 percent, versus an average
forecast of 1.403 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of six of
the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. Yields briefly fell after a report
showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly contracted in the fourth
quarter. The Fed will issue a policy statement at about 2:15
p.m. New York time after a two-day meeting.  “It will be the status quo from the Fed,” said Dan Mulholland, head of U.S. Treasury trading in the capital-markets
unit of BNY Mellon Corp. in New York. “The risk is that the Fed
has a reputation of being somewhat dovish.”  The 10-year note  yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.02 percent at 1:33 p.m. New York time
after touching 2.03 percent, the highest since April 25,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.  The current seven-year note yield rose one basis point to
1.39 percent after touching 1.403 percent, also the highest
since April 25.  Central-bank policy makers said at their last meeting they
may end the purchases sometime in 2013, with members divided
between a mid- or end-of-year finish, according to the minutes
of the Federal Open Market Committee’s Dec. 11-12 gathering.  Fed Buying  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s latest round of bond buying
will reach $1.14 trillion before he ends the program in the
first quarter of 2014, according to median estimates in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  Bernanke will push on with purchases of $40 billion a month
of mortgage bonds and $45 billion a month of Treasuries,
according to the survey of 44 economists, even as some Fed
officials warn his unprecedented balance-sheet expansion will
impair efforts to tighten policy when necessary.  Government bonds briefly pared losses after gross domestic
product, the volume of all goods and services produced, dropped
at a 0.1 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said,
weaker than any economist forecast in a Bloomberg survey. A drop
in government outlays and smaller gain in stockpiles cut a
combined 2.6 percentage points from growth.  Notes Sale  At today’s sale, the bid-to-cover  ratio , which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with amount of securities
offered, was 2.60, compared with 2.72 last month and an average
of 2.71 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 38.2 percent of the notes sold today,
compared with an average of 40.2 percent at the past 10 sales.
They bought 39.9 percent of the notes at the December auction.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.7 percent of
the notes, compared with the 10-auction average of 15.6 percent.
Direct bidders purchased 23.1 percent at the December sale, the
most in records dating to 2009.  U.S. seven-year Treasury notes have lost 1.3 percent this
year, compared with a 1 percent loss for the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes.  The size of the offering was the same as at the past 30
seven-year note sales after peaking at $32 billion from November
2009 through April 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
