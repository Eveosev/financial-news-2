Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , maker of
Global Hawk surveillance drones, said fourth-quarter profit fell
2.7 percent and forecast 2013 earnings that exceeded analysts’
estimates.  Net income from continuing operations was $533 million, or
$2.14 a share, compared with $550 million, or $2.09 a share, a
year earlier, the Falls Church, Virginia-based company said
today in a statement.  Analysts estimated  $1.74 a share, the
average of 20 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell less
than 1 percent to $6.48 billion.  Northrop forecast a full-year profit from continuing
operations of $6.85 to $7.15 a share on sales of about $24
billion.  The Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a profit
of $6.97 a share, on sales of $24.4 billion.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Wes Bush has divested
low-margin businesses such as shipbuilding and has cut jobs to
increase profit. Since 2008, Northrop has reduced “our
headcount by 16 percent to 17 percent” and cut the square
footage of facilities by about 12 percent, Bush told investors
in November.  Northrop, like other U.S. defense companies, will be
affected by across-the-board cuts in U.S. defense spending of
$45 billion through September unless President  Barack Obama  and
Congress agree by March on an alternative way to reduce the
federal deficit.  Defense Cuts  Northrop said its 2013 forecast was based on the assumption
that the automatic cuts, known as sequestration, won’t go into
effect. U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said in an
interview yesterday that such cuts were now “more likely than
unlikely.”  Defense contractors  Raytheon Co. (RTN)  and  General Dynamics Corp. (GD) 
last week projected 2013 profits that fell below investors’
expectations, citing weak U.S. defense demand.  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s largest defense
contractor, last week forecast profit for this year that
exceeded analysts’ estimates, helped by tax credits that
companies can claim for research and development. Under the tax
deal signed by Obama earlier this month, companies are allowed
to retroactively claim credit for 2012 spending as well as
planned research expenditures this year.  Northrop rose less than one percent to $66.32 at the close
in  New York  trading and has gained 14 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
