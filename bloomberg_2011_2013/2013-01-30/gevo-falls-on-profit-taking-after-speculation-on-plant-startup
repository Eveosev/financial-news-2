Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , a U.S. biofuel producer
backed by French oil company  Total SA (FP)  and specialty-chemicals
maker  Lanxess AG (LXS) , declined as investors took advantage of
speculation the company will resume isobutanol production.  Gevo fell 2.1 percent to $2.33 at the close in New York.
Volume was more than seven times the three-month daily average.  Investors are selling today after the Englewood, Colorado-
based company jumped 17 percent yesterday, Shawn Severson, a San
Francisco-based analyst at JMP Securities LLC, said in a
telephone interview.  “It’s profit taking,” said Severson, who rates Gevo the
equivalent of buy with a 12-month price target of $6. “If you
bought it a couple weeks ago at $1.80 or $1.90, you might be
trading around today.”  The gain may be linked to speculation Gevo is preparing to
switch back to isobutanol from ethanol at its plant in Luverne,
 Minnesota , he said.  The company has lost 34 percent of its market value since
announcing Sept. 24 that it stopped processing corn into
isobutanol, a biofuel that may be blended with gasoline or
refined into jet fuel and specialty chemicals, to adjust its
manufacturing process.  “The company never gave a time for an expected startup”
of isobutanol, Severson said. “My initial thought is that it
will be within the first half.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
