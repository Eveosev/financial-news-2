Police Minister Damian Green said
forces in England and  Wales  will be allowed to hire senior
officers from outside the service in a bid to improve their
performance.  Under rules dating back more than a century, only police
officers who have worked their way up through the ranks can
serve as superintendents or senior managers. The new plans,
announced in a consultation by the Home Office today, would open
senior posts to business people, members of the armed forces and
foreigners. Police officers are resisting the move.  “There is no organization, no institution in the world
that can’t get better,” Green told the BBC Radio 4’s “Today”
program. “It’s a very odd situation that you can only get to
senior ranks if you’ve started at the bottom and worked your way
up.”  The president of the Police Superintendents’ Association,
Derek Barnett, told the same program that senior officers
benefit from years of  service  on the beat, talking to citizens
and dealing with criminals.  “We have no shortage of talent in the police service,”
Barnett said. “I don’t accept the premise there is a lack of
talent in the service.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
