Chrysler Group LLC, investing in its
U.S. factories, lowered its free cash flow forecast for 2014 by
two-thirds, a setback for majority owner  Fiat SpA (F)  as the
companies work toward a merger in 2015.  For 2014, Chrysler now sees free cash flow of about $1
billion. In Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne’s original
2009 business plan, Chrysler forecast about $3 billion.
Chrysler has been upgrading its manufacturing processes, which
adds to initial costs, Richard Hilgert, an analyst for
Morningstar Equity Research in Chicago, said in an interview.  “Once everything is up and running and the workforce knows
what it’s doing, it means the company will have better cash flow
coming from that operation,” Hilgert said today by telephone.  The reduced cash forecast contrasts with Chrysler’s success
since 2009, when it emerged from a government-backed rescue.
Boosted by demand for Ram trucks and Jeep sport-utility
vehicles, Chrysler said today fourth-quarter net income rose 68
percent to $378 million from a year earlier. Full-year profit
rose eightfold and may rise 30 percent this year.  Chrysler projected about $80 billion in 2014 revenue, up
from a 2009 forecast of $67.5 billion. The higher sales
projection with little-changed profit outlook indicates narrower
margins.  “They used to think that this could be an up to 8 percent
margin business and now they’re talking about 6 percent going
forward despite a higher revenue base, none of which would make
me particularly bullish on the business,” Erich Hauser, an
analyst with Credit Suisse in London, said in an e-mail.  Product Plan  While Chrysler plans six more model revamps this year than
forecast in 2009, it’s also dropping four all-new models slated
for the Dodge and Chrysler brands. For 2014, it added three new
models and six refreshes.  Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 13 percent to
$17.2 billion, the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based automaker said
in a statement today. Adjusted operating profit rose 40 percent
to $711 million. Full-year net income rose to $1.67 billion from
$183 million.  Chrysler in October confirmed its forecast for 2012 profit
of $1.5 billion on revenue of about $65 billion.  Fiat fell 4.8 percent, the biggest drop since Nov. 20, to
4.46 euros at the close in Milan. That pared the stock’s gain
this year to 18 percent, valuing the Turin, Italy-based
manufacturer at 5.57 billion euros ($7.56 billion).  Counting on Chrysler  Fiat shares fell when Chrysler released its cash flow
forecast, then rose when the Italian company reported a trading
profit, or earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items,
of 987 million euros. That beat the 941-million-euro average of
four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Fiat also decided
not to pay a 2012 dividend to preserve cash.  Marchionne, also CEO of Fiat, is relying on profits from
Chrysler to overcome losses at the Italian company’s mass-market
brands in Europe, where automakers are coping with the worst
sales slump in 19 years. Marchionne has said he plans to merge
the two companies by 2015.  “The goals we’ve set for the year ahead reflect a common
desire by everyone from leadership to the shop floor to succeed
and sustain the power of the house we are building,” Marchionne
said in a statement.  Sales Gains  Chrysler’s U.S. sales have increased for 33 straight months
and its market share has risen three years in a row. Chrysler’s
2012 deliveries rose 21 percent to 1.65 million, which included
a 20 percent increase for Ram pickups. The Ram 1500 this month
received the North American Truck/Utility of the Year award.  The company’s share of the U.S. market increased to 11.4
percent from 10.7 percent a year earlier, according to
researcher Autodata Corp. Last year it gained more market share
than any major automaker other than  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Honda
Motor Co. (7267)   Chrysler forecast 2013 net income of about $2.2 billion,
with revenue increasing to $72 billion to $75 billion. The
company also projected a modified operating profit of about $3.8
billion. It forecast more than $1 billion in free cash flow for
this year. Marchionne said on a conference call with analysts
that free cash flow should be “well above” that figure.  Chrysler forecast $4.8 billion in modified operating profit
in 2014, specifying what had been a range of $4.7 billion to
$5.2 billion. The automaker sees 2.8 million global shipments by
then, with most of the growth coming from the Ram truck and Jeep
sport-utility vehicle brands.  Net income last year was $1.67 billion on revenue of $65.8
billion. Modified operating profit was $2.9 billion, the company
said today.  Fiat rescued Chrysler through a government-brokered
alliance in 2009. Marchionne, 60, obtained control of Chrysler
without paying any cash by pledging Fiat’s vehicles, technology
and managerial expertise. Fiat now owns 58.5 percent of the U.S.
automaker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
