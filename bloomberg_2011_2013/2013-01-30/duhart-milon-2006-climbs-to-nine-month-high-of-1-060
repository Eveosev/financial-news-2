Ten cases of Chateau Duhart-Milon
2006, a Bordeaux fourth-growth wine producer with links to
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, sold for 670 pounds ($1,060) each on
the London-based Liv-ex exchange, the highest for nine months.  That was 29 percent up from the low of 520 pounds a case
reached in November, while still 42 percent below the peak of
1,150 pounds attained for the vintage in May 2011, according
to data on Liv-exâ€™s Cellar Watch website.  Duhart-Milon is owned by  Domaines Barons de Rothschild
(Lafite) , which controls Lafite-Rothschild, and the vineyards in
Pauillac are neighbors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
