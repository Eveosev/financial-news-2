Police Minister Damian Green said
the government would examine a proposal by Britain’s top
policeman to force workers to undergo mandatory drugs tests.  The Daily Mail newspaper reported comments that
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe made
yesterday to lawmakers on the all-party parliamentary group on
cannabis and children. He said testing and the fear of losing
their jobs would act as deterrents for drug users.  “It seems to me we have got to plant in people’s minds
something to affect the demand as well as supply,” Hogan-Howe
said, the newspaper reported. “You can think of many
occupations where if you were working with a colleague, you
would want to be sure in fact that they were drug-free.”  Asked to respond to the proposal today on behalf of the
government, Green told BBC Radio 4’s “Today” radio program,
“It’s an interesting idea and we will go away and think about
it.”  An estimated one in three adults has taken an illegal drug
in their lifetime, according to the latest figures from the  Home
Office  released in September. About 12 million people have tried
an illicit drug, the 2011/12 Crime Survey for England and  Wales 
found.  To contact the reporters on this story:
