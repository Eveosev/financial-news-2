Gold may climb to a record above
$2,000 an ounce and average between $1,700 and $1,800 this year
as investment demand remains strong, according to Russian gold
and silver miner  Polymetal International Plc. (POLY)   Central banks adding bullion to their reserves will
continue to boost demand this year, Polymetal’s Chief Executive
Officer Vitaly Nesis said today in an interview. Bullion rose a
12th straight year in 2012, the best run in at least nine
decades in  London  trading, as central banks from  Europe  to  China 
pledged more stimulus to bolster economic growth. Central banks
bought the metal to bolster official reserves, while investors
are holding a near-record amount in exchange-traded products.  “Investment demand remains high,”Nesis said in a phone
interview from Polymetal’s St. Petersburg offices. “This year,
central banks’ purchases will be the main demand driver.”  Such purchases increased 17 percent to 536 metric tons last
year, the most in 48 years,  Thomson Reuters  GFMS estimate.
Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products were 2,610.1
tons as of yesterday,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show, 0.9
percent below the record set Dec. 20.  Bullion, which averaged $1,668.75 an ounce in London in
2012, will average between $1,700 and $1,800 in 2013, and peak
above $2,000 during the year, Nesis said. The record was
$1,921.15 in September 2011.  Polymetal, listed on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index and  Russia ’s
largest silver producer, doesn’t see any trend for investors to
switch from gold to silver this year because silver “is a less
significant asset in the global financial system,” according to
Nesis.  Amursk Facility  Gold for immediate delivery was $1,679.54 an ounce in
London trading at 2:22 p.m. local time, up 0.9 percent, and
rising for a second day. Silver for immediate delivery was up
1.5 percent to $31.87 an ounce, also rising for a second day.  Polymetal said today its 2012 output rose 31 percent to
1.06 million ounces of gold equivalent. It expects this year to
increase output to 1.2 million ounces and sees “moderate risk”
of downgrading the target by 5 percent if its Amursk concentrate
facility in the Khabarovsk region of the country’s  Far East 
fails to run at expected capacity, Nesis said. Polymetal sees
its 2013 revenue at about $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion at
current prices, he said.  Polymetal’s  shares  dropped 2.4 percent to 1,083 pence
today.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
