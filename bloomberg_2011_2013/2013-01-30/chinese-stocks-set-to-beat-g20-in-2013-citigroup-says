China ’s  yuan-denominated stocks  are
poised to outperform all Group of 20-nation equity markets in
2013 after posting the second-worst performance among global
economies over the past three years, according to  Citigroup Inc. (C)   The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1 percent to 2,382.48
yesterday, extending its rally from a Dec. 3 low to 22 percent.
A gain of 20 percent signals a  bull market  to some investors.
Chinese equities will build on the advance in the first half of
2013 as earnings growth exceeds analysts’ estimates, Minggao Shen, the Hong Kong-based head of China research at Citigroup,
said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday.  The  Shanghai A-share index  may rise a further 12 percent
from yesterday’s close of 2,493.78 to 2,780 in the first half,
said Shen, reiterating a first-half target from Jan. 15. The
 MSCI China Index (MXCN)  of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies, which
has jumped 28 percent since Sept. 5, may climb another 15
percent to 20 percent as profit growth for companies in the
index expands as much as 15 percent this year, compared with a
consensus analyst estimate of 10.4 percent, Shen said.  Shen predicted in a Nov. 28 report that Chinese stocks
would rally in 2013, estimating that the A-share gauge would
rise to 2,565 this year as the nation’s new leaders introduced
measures to bolster the economy. China will actively promote
urbanization as it fosters domestic demand, the Communist
Party’s Politburo said Dec. 4 in its first assessment of the
economy under new leader Xi Jinping.  ‘Hold Up’  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s China equity strategist Chen Li reiterated his
forecast last week for an annual gain of 20 percent for the
Shanghai Composite measure.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  strategist
David Cui said in a Jan. 25 briefing that Chinese stocks will
“hold up fairly well” until March, when the new government may
introduce new restrictions on the  property market  to restrain
home-price gains.  The Shanghai Composite has been the worst performer among
benchmark indexes in the G20 after Italy’s benchmark in the past
three years, Shen said. The Shanghai index slumped 30 percent in
the period through Jan. 4, 2013, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
