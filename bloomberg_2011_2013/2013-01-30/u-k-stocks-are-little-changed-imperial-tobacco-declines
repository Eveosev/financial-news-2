U.K. stocks  fell from a 4 1/2-year
high as a report showed the  U.S. economy , its largest trading
partner, unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter.  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest tobacco
company, slid 4.3 percent after saying first-half profit will
decline.  Petrofac (PFC)  Ltd. slumped 7 percent as Italian peer Saipem
SpA cut its profit forecasts.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  fell the most in
16 months after projecting increased costs.  WPP Plc (WPP)  climbed to a
12-year high as Jefferies Group Inc. advised investors to buy
the shares.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index lost 16.08 points, or 0.3
percent, to 6,323.11 at the close in  London  as separate data
showed the  Spanish economy  also contracted in the fourth
quarter. The stocks gauge has still rallied 7.2 percent this
month, on course for the biggest jump since October 2011. The
broader FTSE All-Share Index also fell 0.3 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index slipped 0.5 percent.  “Upside momentum may be hard found in the days ahead, with
the poor growth figures from the U.S. and  Spain  today reminding
the market that perhaps it isn’t the right time to be
aggressively bullish,” Ishaq Siddiqi, a market analyst at ETX
Capital in London, wrote in a note. “It is difficult at this
point to see what would act as a catalyst for a resumption of
January’s rally next month.”  The number of shares changing hands in  FTSE 100 (UKX)  companies
was 26 percent greater than the 30-day average today, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Economy  The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, shrank in the fourth
quarter, restrained by the biggest plunge in defense spending in
four decades and dwindling inventory growth. Gross domestic
product dropped at a 0.1 percent annual rate, weaker than any
economist forecast in a Bloomberg survey and the worst
performance since the second quarter of 2009, Commerce
Department figures showed.  The  Federal Reserve  will probably renew its commitment to
continue buying assets into next year at a policy decision,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of 44 economists. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  concludes its two-day meeting
today and will publish its statement after the close of European
equity trading.  In the euro area,  economic confidence  rose more than
economists forecast in January, adding to signs that the 17-
nation currency bloc may be emerging from a recession. An index
of executive and consumer sentiment rose to 89.2 from a revised
87.8 in December, the European Commission in Brussels said
today. Economists had forecast a reading of 88.2, according to
the median of 30 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Imperial Tobacco  Imperial Tobacco  lost 4.3 percent to 2,361 pence, the
lowest price in almost three months. The company said first-half
profit will decline because of worsening conditions in Europe
and reported a smaller gain in first-quarter revenue than
analysts estimated.  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) , Europe’s largest cigarette
maker, slipped 0.8 percent to 3,275.5 pence.  Petrofac slumped 7 percent to 1,615 pence, the biggest drop
in 16 months. Saipem plunged 34 percent in Milan trading after
Europe’s largest oil-service provider cut profit forecasts,
stoking concern that earnings across the industry will be lower
than analysts estimated.  JKX Oil & Gas Plc (JKX) , an energy producer active in Ukraine and
Russia, fell 5 percent to 58.88 pence, the lowest price in nine
years.  Antofagasta Forecasts  Antofagasta sank 8.3 percent to 1,169 pence, the largest
decline since September 2011, as it forecast the cost to mine a
pound of copper would increase by 14 percent this year. The
mining company said it sees 2013 copper output at 700,000 tons
and gold output at 260,000 ounces.  Rio Tinto Group slipped 0.7 percent to 3,552 pence. The
second-biggest mining company is considering a temporary halt to
construction at its $6.2 billion Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold
project in Mongolia as the government demands a greater share of
profit from the mine, two people familiar with the plans said.  WPP advanced 1.3 percent to 990 pence, the highest price
since September 2000. Shares of the world’s largest advertising
company were raised to buy from hold at Jefferies.  Phoenix Group Holdings soared 9.3 percent to 630 pence, the
largest gain since June. The U.K.’s biggest manager of closed
life-insurance funds plans to raise 250 million pounds ($394
million) in a share sale to lower its debt burden.  Imagination Technologies Group Plc (IMG)  rallied 13 percent to
497.9 pence, snapping five days of losses. Morgan Stanley
upgraded the U.K. designer of chip technology for phones and
tablet computers to overweight, the equivalent of buy, from
equal weight.  To contact the reporters on this story:
