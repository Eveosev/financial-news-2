Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316) ,  Japan ’s second-largest bank by market value, is on pace to
post record annual profit after a stock-market rally fueled
third-quarter earnings growth that beat estimates. Shares rose.  Net income  more than doubled to 219.4 billion yen ($2.4
billion) in the three months ended Dec. 31 from 97.2 billion yen
a year earlier, company figures showed yesterday. Nine-month
profit climbed 34 percent to 550.4 billion yen, approaching the
record 686.8 billion yen reached for the year ended March 2006.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s pledge to stimulate the economy
has fueled the Nikkei 225 Stock Average’s surge to the highest
level since April 2010, helping to ease losses tied to  Sumitomo
Mitsui ’s equity holdings. Signs of a lending recovery are
emerging in Japan, with loans by city banks climbing for the
first time in three years in December.  “Sumitomo Mitsui will probably break their all-time annual
profit this year given the improved business environment
surrounding the megabanks,” said Toyoki Sameshima, a Tokyo-
based analyst at BNP Paribas SA, who predicts the bank’s profit
this quarter at about 190 billion yen. “Funding demand seems to
be picking up from medium-sized companies in Japan.”  Shares of Sumitomo Mitsui rose as much as 5.4 percent in
Tokyo trading, the biggest intraday gain since Oct. 27, 2011,
and traded at 3,630 yen as of 9:53 a.m., the highest in more
than three years.  Estimates Beat  Third-quarter profit exceeded the 152.3 billion yen average
estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The results
were calculated by subtracting first-half profit from nine-month
figures reported in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Lending income  gained 9.1 percent in the quarter from a
year earlier to 355.8 billion yen, according to the
calculations. Fees and commissions income rose 13.7 percent to
224.9 billion yen, and profit from trading  government bonds  and
other securities more than doubled to 107.4 billion yen.  The stock has surged 48 percent over the past three months
and the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  has jumped 24 percent as Abe’s  Liberal
Democratic Party  won an election on a campaign to end deflation
with fiscal and monetary stimulus.  Brokerage Rebound  Sumitomo Mitsui’s losses from shareholdings totaled 67.3
billion yen in the nine months, easing from 132.9 billion yen in
the six months through Sept. 30. The losses still doubled from
33.1 billion yen a year earlier, the statement showed.  The stock rally fueled earnings at the bank’s brokerage
unit. SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. yesterday posted net income of
12.2 billion yen for the quarter, rebounding from a loss of 1.6
billion yen a year earlier. Fees from sales of mutual funds and
other investment products more than doubled to 16.8 billion yen.  The nine-month net income of 550.4 billion yen exceeded the
bank’s full-year forecast for 540 billion yen profit. The
holding company, now led by President  Koichi Miyata , was formed
in 2002 following a merger.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , the country’s third-biggest
bank by market value, is scheduled to release earnings today,
and  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , the largest, will
report tomorrow.  Loans outstanding at Japan’s  city banks  rose 0.3 percent in
December, the first increase since October 2009, according to
central bank data. Overall  lending  including by regional banks
increased 1.4 percent.  Still, the resurgence in borrowing won’t be strong enough
to improve banks’ profit margins from loans as long as the  Bank
of Japan (8301)  eases monetary policy and keeps benchmark rates near
zero, said Natsumu Tsujino, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “It’ll take time before local loan requirements
substantially grow as the economy expands on the back of the
government’s stimulus measures,” Tokyo-based Tsujino said.  Japanese lenders have the lowest loan profitability in
 Asia . The average net interest margin at the 85 companies on the
 Topix Banks Index (TPNBNK)  is 1.3 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg based on their latest filings. That compares with 2
percent at  Singapore ’s three biggest banks and 2.1 percent for
the four so-called pillar lenders in  Australia .  Net interest margin at Sumitomo Mitsui stood at 1.18
percent as of Sept. 30, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
