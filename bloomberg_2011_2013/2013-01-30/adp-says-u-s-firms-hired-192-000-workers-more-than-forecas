Companies took on more workers than
projected in January, a sign the U.S. labor market was staying
on the path to expansion at the start of the year, according to
a private report based on payrolls.  The 192,000 increase in employment, the most since February
2012, followed a revised 185,000 gain in December, figures from
the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed
today. The median forecast of 38 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a January advance of 165,000.  Growing payrolls show that U.S. businesses see strong
enough demand in the future to hire even as lawmakers in
Washington spar over the  federal budget . A Labor Department
report on Feb. 1 may show companies added 168,000 workers to
staff last month while the  unemployment rate  held at 7.8
percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  “The job market is slowly but steadily improving,”  Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc., said in a
statement. Moody’s produces the figures with ADP. “Construction
is finally kicking into gear and more than offsetting the
weakness in manufacturing.”  Economists’ estimates for the ADP measure ranged from
120,000 to 235,000.  Job creation  in December was previously
reported by ADP as 215,000.  Goods-Producing  Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and
construction companies, increased their headcounts by 15,000,
today’s ADP figures showed. Construction employment was also up
by 15,000, while factory employment declined by 3,000.  Service providers added 177,000 jobs. Businesses involved
in financial activities increased staff by 12,000, professional
and business services raised staff by 40,000 and trade,
transportation and utilities hired 33,000.  Payrolls at companies employing 500 or more workers dropped
2,000 in January. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499
employees, rose by 79,000, and small companies increased
payrolls by 115,000, ADP said.  In October, ADP changed the method it had used to derive
its employment figures since 2001. The group’s report is now
calculated from a larger sample using a new methodology, and it
is released jointly with Moody’s of  West Chester ,  Pennsylvania .  Later this week, the Labor Department’s national employment
report may show that overall hiring including government jobs
rose 161,000 last month after a 155,000 gain in December,
according to the Bloomberg survey median.  Finding Jobs  Progress toward finding jobs for the 12.2 million
unemployed Americans would help the economy overcome the fiscal
contraction expected this year. Congress on Jan. 1 allowed
payroll taxes to revert to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent and
boosted the levy on top income earners. Lawmakers are now
battling over spending reductions scheduled for March 1 that
would further crimp growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
