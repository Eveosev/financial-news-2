Following is the
technical note of the Gross Domestic Product
report from the Commerce Department.  This technical note provides background
information about the source data and
estimating methods used to produce the
estimates presented in the GDP news release.
The complete set of estimates for the fourth
quarter is available on BEA’s Web site at
www.bea.gov; a brief summary of “highlights”
is also posted on the Web site. In a few
weeks, the estimates will be published in
BEA’s monthly journal, the Survey of Current
Business, along with a more detailed
analysis of the estimates (“GDP and the
Economy”).  Real GDP  Real GDP decreased 0.1 percent (annual
rate) in the fourth quarter of 2012,
following an increase of 3.1 percent in the
third quarter. The downturn in real GDP in
the fourth quarter reflected downturns in
inventory investment, in federal government
spending, in exports, and in state and local
government spending that were partly offset
by an upturn in nonresidential fixed
investment, a larger decrease in imports,
and an acceleration in  consumer spending .  Source Data for the Advance Estimate  The advance GDP estimate for the fourth
quarter of 2012 is based on source data that
are incomplete and subject to revision.
Three months of source data were available
for consumer spending on goods; shipments of
capital equipment; motor vehicle sales and
inventories; durable manufacturing
inventories; federal government outlays; and
consumer, producer, and international prices.
Only two months of data were available for
most other key data sources; BEA’s
assumptions for the third month are shown in
table A. Among those assumptions are the
following:  *an increase in nondurable manufacturing
inventories,
*an increase in non-motor-vehicle merchant
wholesale and retail inventories,
*a decrease in exports of goods, excluding
gold, and
*a decrease in imports of goods, excluding
gold.  Federal government spending  Fourth-quarter federal  government
spending  decreased at a 15.0 percent annual
rate, reflecting a large decrease in
national defense spending. The decrease in
national defense spending is based on the
Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS) for October,
November, and December from the Department
of the Treasury, which shows a large
decrease in fourth-quarter outlays for
Department of Defense-military programs
other than for military personnel. (The MTS
shows a fourth-quarter increase in outlays
for military personnel, but that increase
reflects special factors such as once-a-year
lump sum payments that BEA distributes
across the quarters of the year, and an
extra pay day that BEA adjusts for in
preparing accrual-based estimates.)  Effects of the Midwest Drought  BEA’s GDP estimates reflect the
continuing effects of this summer’s extreme
hot weather and drought in the Midwest on
farm production. For the most part, the
effects are embedded in the regular source
data that are used by BEA and cannot be
separately identified in components such as
personal consumption expenditures or exports
of goods.  The farm inventory investment estimates
reflect the effects of the drought on farm
production, particularly for corn and
soybeans. The estimates for the fourth
quarter of 2012 are based on farm income
statistics from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  released in November and on crop
production reports for corn and soybeans
released through January. In current dollars,
the estimates indicate that the drought
reduced farm inventory investment by about
$24 billion in the fourth quarter, after
reducing farm inventory investment by about
$28 billion in the third quarter and $12
billion in the second quarter. Adjusting for
inflation, the change in farm inventories
added 0.11 percentage point to the fourth-
quarter change in real GDP after subtracting
0.38 percentage point from the third-quarter
change and 0.17 percentage point from the
second-quarter change.  For additional information about the
methodology used to estimate the impacts of
the drought, see the box effects of the 2012
Midwest Drought on the NIPA Estimates・
(www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/10
October/1012_gdpecon_anchor.pdf) in the
October 2012 Survey of Current Business.  Prices  The price index for gross domestic
purchases the prices paid by U.S. residents
for goods and services wherever produced
increased 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter
after increasing 1.4 percent in the third.
Excluding food and energy prices, the price
index for gross domestic purchases increased
1.1 percent after increasing 1.2 percent.  Disposable Personal Income, Special
Dividends, and Accelerated Compensation  Real disposable personal income (DPI)
increased 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter,
following an increase of 0.5 percent in the
third. The acceleration in real DPI
reflected accelerated and special dividends
that were paid by many companies late in the
quarter in anticipation of changes in
individual income tax rates, as well as some
acceleration in wages and salaries.  Based on reports from more than 2,000
companies from Compustat, BEA estimates that
companies paid special or accelerated
dividends of $39.5 billion in the fourth
quarter, of which $26.4 billion ($105.6
billion at an annual rate) was paid to
persons and is included in personal income.  In addition to the special dividends,
there is evidence that some companies
accelerated their payment of bonuses or
other types of irregular pay. In the absence
of source data that cover these types of
payments, BEA made a judgmental adjustment
to its estimates of fourth-quarter wages and
salaries, adding an additional $15 billion
(annual rate) to the regular estimate of
wages and salaries. In May, BEA will
incorporate fourth-quarter source data from
the BLS quarterly census of employment and
wages, which covers irregular pay.  The personal saving rate was 4.7
percent in the fourth quarter, compared with
3.6 percent in the third.  Hurricane Sandy  On October 29,  Hurricane Sandy  made
landfall on the New Jersey coast and caused
major damage and disruption throughout the
Northeast region. Like other disasters,
Hurricane Sandy disrupted many types of
production through closures of factories,
offices, and transportation facilities,
while causing certain types of production,
such as  emergency services  and rebuilding
activities, to increase. These effects on
production are included, but not separately
identified, in the source data that BEA uses
to prepare the estimates of GDP;
consequently, BEA is not able to provide an
estimate of the overall impact of Sandy on
fourth-quarter GDP.  While the destruction of fixed assets,
such as residential or nonresidential
structures, does not directly affect GDP,
national income, or personal income, BEA
does track disaster losses as part of its
fixed asset accounts. BEA’s preliminary
estimate is that $35.8 billion in private
fixed assets and $8.6 billion in government
fixed assets, measured at current cost, were
lost due to Hurricane Sandy.  BEA also prepares estimates of the
insurance benefits paid or received due to
major disasters. These benefits are recorded
on an accrual basis in the quarter in which
the disaster occurs and are classified as
capital transfers, and thus do not affect
the measures of GDP, personal income, or
saving. BEA’s preliminary estimate is that
domestic and foreign insurance companies
expect to pay benefits for losses related to
Sandy of $20.6 billion ($82.5 billion at an
annual rate), and that the federal
government’s National Flood Insurance
Program is expected to pay an additional
$7.5 billion ($30.0 billion at an annual
rate) in Sandy-related benefits.  For additional information, see how are
the measures of production and income in the
national accounts affected by a natural or
man-made disaster?

ESTIMATE OF GDP FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF
2012  For many of the key series used to
prepare the advance estimate of GDP,
including retail sales, unit automobile and
truck sales and inventories, manufacturers’
shipments of nondefense capital goods,
manufacturers’ inventories of durable goods,
federal defense spending, and consumer,
producer, and international price indexes,
actual data are available for all months of
the quarter.  For the key series shown in this table,
actual data for the third month of the
quarter usually are not available in time
for inclusion in the advance GDP estimate.
BEA makes assumptions for the source data
that are not yet available; assumptions for
December 2012 are shown in the last column
of the table.  For most series shown, the
data for November are preliminary and
subject to further revision. Occasionally,
the data for earlier months are also subject
to revision.  All series shown in the table are in
billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted at
annual rates, and are published by the
Bureau of the Census.  2012  Jul.      Aug.      Sep.      Oct.      Nov.
