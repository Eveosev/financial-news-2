The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment rose,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed one basis point to 110 basis
points as of 8:05 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is set for the highest close
since Jan. 16, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced one basis point
to 117.5 as of 11:05 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark is poised for the highest
close since Jan. 1, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 0.5 to 134.5 as of
9:15 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices. The
measure has fallen from 159 basis points at the end of 2012,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
