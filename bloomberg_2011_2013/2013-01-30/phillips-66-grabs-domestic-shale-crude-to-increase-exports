(Corrects to say pipelines transport natural gas liquids
in seventh paragraph.)  Phillips 66 expects to refine more
domestic shale oil this year and increase export capacity at
 Gulf Coast  and West Coast refineries, the company said in
today’s earnings report.  The company plans to use more than 200,000 barrels a day of
shale oil in 2013, up from 112,000 in 2012. To transport the
crude, the company received a tanker in January and expects to
add 2,000 railcars next month.  “This is definitely something that oil refiners are going
to follow suit with,” said Carl Larry, president of Houston-
based Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC. “It’s surprising to see this
much shale being used, with limited resources outside of
railcars.”  Phillips is adding capacity amid rising U.S. oil
production.  Domestic output  reached the highest level since 1993
this month, according to the Energy Information Administration,
the statistical unit of the Energy Department.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  processed 135,000 barrels a day of domestic
shale crude in the fourth quarter of 2012, almost double the
year-earlier total.  The company forecast that refinery export capacity will
rise to 370,000 barrels a day by the end of 2013 from 285,000.
It expects to finish a project at its Ferndale, Washington,
refinery in the first quarter to increase capacity by 20,000
barrels a day and plans other investments in Gulf Coast and West
Coast refineries.  Phillips also plans to move natural gas liquids on
pipelines built by DCP Midstream, which is jointly owned by
Phillips 66 and  Spectra Energy Corp. (SE)  It said the Sand Hills
pipeline from the Eagle Ford basin in  Texas  to Mont Belvieu,
Texas, is in service, with a second phase connecting to the
Permian Basin in West Texas to be complete in the second
quarter.  The Southern Hills pipeline from the central U.S. to Mont
Belvieu is on schedule to start in mid-2013 with an initial
capacity of 150,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
