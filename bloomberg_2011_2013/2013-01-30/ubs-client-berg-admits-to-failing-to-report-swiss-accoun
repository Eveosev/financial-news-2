A former  UBS AG (UBSN)  client, Christopher
B. Berg, pleaded guilty to failing to file a required report
with the U.S. Treasury Department about a Swiss bank account
used to shelter some of his income from taxation.  Berg, a self-employed marketing consultant, admitted today
in federal court in  San Jose ,  California , that he didn’t file a
Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Account, or FBAR, for a UBS
account he set up in 2000, according to court filings. Berg, who
works in the furniture industry, opened the account in the name
of a British Virgin Islands corporation, CC Ventures Inc., he
admitted.  “Those who hide their assets and income in offshore
accounts should realize that there is no safe haven from the
IRS,” Richard Weber, chief of the IRS criminal investigation
division, said in a statement.  Zurich-based UBS, the largest Swiss bank, was charged with
conspiracy in February 2009 and avoided prosecution by admitting
it aided  tax evasion , paying $780 million and handing over
account data on 250 clients. It later disclosed information on
about 4,450 more accounts.  In a crackdown on offshore tax evasion, the U.S. Justice
Department has charged dozens of U.S. taxpayers as well as more
than two dozen offshore bankers, lawyers and advisers.  Bought Vehicle  Berg, of Portola Valley, California, admitted to depositing
$642,070 in compensation in his UBS account from 2001 to 2005.
In 2001, he withdrew $28,000 to buy a vehicle. Berg also
withdrew $58,000 and 10,000 euros ($13,567) from UBS branches in
 Europe , he admitted. He also used a Eurocard bank card
associated with the account while in Europe, he admitted.  The tax harm associated with Berg’s conduct is $270,757,
according to prosecutors.  Berg faces as long as five years in prison when he
sentenced on July 8. His attorney, Ed Robbins, didn’t
immediately return a call or e-mail seeking comment on the case.  The case is U.S. v. Berg, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporters on this story:
