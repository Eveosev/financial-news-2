 Crude oil options volatility fell
while the underlying futures climbed to a four-month high as the
Federal Reserve maintained an asset-buying program to boost the
economy.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 18.92 percent at 4:20 p.m. on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange, down from 19.71 yesterday.  Crude oil for March delivery rose 37 cents to $97.94 a
barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement price since Sept.
14. Oil advanced for a third day after the Fed said at the
conclusion of a two-day meeting that it will keep purchasing
securities at the rate of $85 billion a month.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $115 calls, which were unchanged at 3 cents a barrel on
volume of 5,800 contracts. The second-most active, with 1,732
lots exchanged, were April $90 puts, which fell 6 cents to 72
cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would decline, or puts, accounted for 57
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 54 percent of
volume.  March $95 puts were the most active options yesterday, with
8,823 contracts trading as they fell 34 cents to 77 cents a
barrel. April $90 puts slipped 12 cents to 78 cents a barrel on
4,797 lots.  Open interest was highest for March $110 calls with 42,681
contracts. Next were March $85 puts at 33,399 and March $80 puts
at 27,399.  To contact the reporter on this story:
