Total SA and Chevron Corp. both
failed to buy  North Sea  Forties crude at a lower price than
yesterday. There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals grade
in northwest Europe or the Mediterranean.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, issued a
tender to buy low-sulfur crude for delivery for three months
from April to June, said a company official.  North Sea  Total sought to buy Forties at 50 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent for loading Feb. 17 to Feb. 23, a Bloomberg survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window
showed. That’s 5 cents less than its equivalent bid yesterday
and compares with cargoes it bought on Jan. 22 at premiums of 35
cents and 40 cents.  Chevron was also unsuccessful with its bid at plus 45 cents
for a cargo loading on the same dates, according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose 6 cents to 69 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for March settlement traded at $114.71 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $114.28 in the previous session. The April
contract was at $113.69, a discount of $1.02 to March.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Urals crude, the Platts
survey showed. Gunvor Group Ltd. bid unsuccessfully yesterday
for 100,000 metric tons at a discount of 90 cents a barrel to
Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened by 2 cents a barrel to minus 30 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest  Europe , the  discount 
increased to 88 cents from 86 cents yesterday, the data showed.  PKN Orlen SA bought 100,000 tons of Urals from Glencore
International Plc for loading Feb. 19 to Feb. 23 from either
Primorsk or Ust-Luga via an informal closed tender, according to
three people with knowledge of the matter. The company yesterday
bought a Feb. 15 to Feb. 19 cargo from Vitol Group.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold two lots of Urals to Gunvor and
Repsol SA for loading next month from Ust-Luga, according to
four traders who participate in the market.  Gunvor bought the Feb. 13 to Feb. 14 consignment while
Repsol purchased the Feb. 15 to Feb. 16 lot, the people said,
asking not to be identified as the information is confidential.  Surgut issued a separate tender today, offering shipments
of 100,000 tons each for loading on Feb. 19 and Feb. 20 and Feb.
21 to Feb. 22 from Ust-Luga and for Feb. 23 to Feb. 24 from
Primorsk, the people said.  OAO Rosneft awarded February Urals shipments from Primorsk
and the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk to Exxon Mobil Corp.,
Glencore and Vitol via a tender, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose 16 cents to $2.32 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, which is the most since Jan. 11,
Bloomberg data show.  Pertamina is seeking cargoes for its refineries at
Balikpapan and Cilacap, said the official, who asked not to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media.
