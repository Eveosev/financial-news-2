International providers have
suspended credit lines and halted dispatches of medical
equipment to  Venezuela  until local distributors pay off debt
totaling $215 million, El Nacional  reported , citing Anerlin
Guerra, executive director of the Venezuelan Association of
Distributors of Medical, Dental, Laboratory and Other Equipment.  Venezuela’s Foreign Exchange Board, known as Cadivi, hasn’t
provided dollars since August to 127 companies that sell medical
equipment to Venezuela’s hospitals and the health ministry, the
Caracas-based daily quoted Guerra as saying.  Guerra wasn’t immediately available to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg. Cadivi didn’t immediately respond to an
e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
