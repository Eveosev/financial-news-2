Russia  is scrapping a decade-long
agreement with the U.S. on cooperation in law enforcement and
drug control, the second move within a week reflecting worsening
ties between the former Cold War foes.  The accord “doesn’t correspond to present-day realities
and has exhausted its potential,” according to an  order 
published on the government’s website today and signed by Prime
Minister Dmitry Medvedev.  Relations have worsened since Vladimir Putin returned to
the presidency last year with disputes over U.S. human rights
sanctions and the Obama administration’s support for democratic
rights in Russia and its efforts to oust the leadership of
Soviet-era ally  Syria . Last week, the U.S. said it was quitting
a working group on civil society with Russia after the Kremlin
increased limitations on non-government organizations.  “Ties are entering a serious cold phase,”  Igor Yurgens , a
former aide to Medvedev who now serves as a member of the
presidential human rights commission, said in an interview today
in Moscow. “The situation could escalate further.”  The U.S. in December passed legislation that will impose
visa restrictions and an asset freeze on Russian officials
allegedly linked to the 2009 death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management Ltd., as
well as other officials accused of human rights abuses. Russia
retaliated by barring American citizens from adopting Russian
orphans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
