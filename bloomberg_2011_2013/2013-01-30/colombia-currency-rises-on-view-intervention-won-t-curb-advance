Colombia’s peso rose to a one-week
high on speculation more dollar purchases announced by the
central bank won’t curb a four-year rally that is making
exporters less competitive.  The peso gained for a second day, appreciating 0.1 percent
to 1,771.70 per dollar at 10:11 a.m. in Bogota, the highest
level on a closing basis since Jan. 21. The currency pared its
monthly drop to 0.3 percent.  The central bank will buy at least $30 million daily and
purchase at least $3 billion between February and May, officials
announced Jan. 28. The vote to step up dollar purchases was
unanimous, central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe said today in
an interview with Javeriana Radio.  “The market considers that it won’t be enough,” Daniel Escobar, the head analyst at Global Securities in Bogota, said
by telephone. “Investors for now don’t feel like the
intervention is very strong.”  Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said yesterday in an
interview with CM& Television that Colombia doesn’t rule out
using capital controls to weaken the peso.  “We don’t like capital controls, we aren’t thinking of
using them at the moment, but this option is always on hand,
it’s always a possibility,” Cardenas said. “Because one thing
we are clear about is that the Colombian economy doesn’t need an
exchange rate of 1,770 per dollar.”  Yields on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in 2024 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.27 percent, according to the central bank. The price fell
0.123 centavo to 139.914 centavos per peso. Yields closed at
5.23 percent on Jan. 25, the lowest level since the securities
were first issued in 2009.  Banco de la Republica reduced its benchmark rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 4 percent on Jan. 28 to support
economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
