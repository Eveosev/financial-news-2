Refiners including  Phillips 66 (PSX)  and
 Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  reached record highs as they beat
earnings estimates and promised to turn an abundance of cheap
U.S. oil into a boon for shareholders.  Phillips 66, the largest U.S. independent refiner by
revenue, rose 1.5 percent to $60.76 at the close in  New York .
Marathon Petroleum gained 1.3 percent to $72.89, the highest
since June 2011.  Phillips 66 plans to expand a share buyback program by $1
billion and boost its annual  dividend , it said in a statement
today. Marathon will expand its buyback program by $2 billion,
according to a statement today.  “They’re taking advantage of the God-given gift of very
wide crude discounts and cheap natural gas,”  Fadel Gheit , a New
York-based analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said in a telephone
interview today. “They are putting the money to good use and
it’s reflected in the stock price.”  U.S. refiners in some regions paid an average of $17.48
less for every barrel they processed compared to the global
benchmark oil price. The difference between the cost of crude
and the price at which refiners sell fuel on the U.S. Gulf Coast
 averaged  $5.11 a barrel in the fourth quarter, the most since
2005 and more than double the average during the same time last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Excluding a refinery writedown, per-share profit at
Phillips 66 was $2.06 a share, 37 cents more than the $1.69
average of 16  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Marathon Petroleum, which was spun off from  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) 
last year, said fourth-quarter profit was $755 million, or $2.24
a share, 16 cents more than the $2.08  average  of four analysts’
estimates.  Marathon rose 89 percent last year and had a total return
of 94 percent, the highest of any energy company on the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)  Phillips 66 has risen 85 percent since it
was spun off of  ConocoPhillips (COP)  in May. Independent refiners do
not explore for or produce crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
