Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) ,  Europe â€™s
second-largest clothing retailer, reported a third straight drop
in fourth-quarter profit after the company stepped up
discounting in an effort to pull in more shoppers.  Net income slid 1.3 percent to 5.29 billion kronor ($83
million) in the three months ended Nov. 30, Stockholm-based H&M
said in a statement today. That topped the 5.20 billion-kronor
average estimate of 16 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The profit drop halts a revival at the fashion retailer,
which had reported earnings growth in each of the last three
quarters after five consecutive declines. H&M makes most of its
revenue from the euro-area, where governments are cutting
spending and the jobless rate is at a record 11.8 percent as the
economy continues to suffer from the sovereign-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
