Albrecht Durer’s woodcut titled
“The Rhinoceros” set an auction record for the German
Renaissance artist with a purchase price of $866,500 at
Christie’s in  New York  yesterday.  More records followed in today’s Renaissance and Old
Master sales at Christie’s.  The rhino defeated saints and warriors in a 62-lot sale of
Durer prints that tallied $6 million.  Bids for the 1515 woodcut quickly surpassed the work’s
target range of $100,000 to $150,000. It depicts an animal that
appeared in Lisbon in 1515, a gift to the king of  Portugal  from
an Indian sultan and the first rhino seen in  Europe  since
antiquity, according to the auction catalog.  Although 24 percent of the lots failed to sell, the total
was within the estimated range of $4.6 million to $6.9 million.  While Christie’s maintains the confidentiality of its
sellers, dealers identified the consignor of the Durers as Swiss
collector Samuel Josefowitz.  “It’s an open secret,” said Susan Schulman, a New York-
based private  art dealer  specializing in Old Masters prints.
“In the second half of the 20th century, Sam was the biggest
buyer of Old Masters prints.”  Josefowitz assembled the collection piece by piece over
four decades.  “He always bought the very best he could obtain,” said
Tim Schmelcher, director of Christie’s prints department in
 London . “Money was no object.”  Other Records  Five more records were set today during Christie’s sales
of Renaissance and Old Master paintings, which together brought
$62.6 million. “The Madonna and Child” by Fra Bartolommeo sold
for $12.96 million, the top price paid for the artist at
auction.  Botticelli’s “Madonna and Child With Young Saint John the
Baptist” fetched $10.4 million, surpassing the high estimate of
$7 million and setting an artist record.  The painting was acquired in 1925 by John D. Rockefeller Jr. from legendary art dealer Joseph Duveen and remained in the
Rockefeller family for more than 50 years. The consignor bought
the work for $440,000 at Christie’s in 1992, according to the
auction-price database Artnet.com.  Durer’s auction record had been 409,250 pounds ($653,336 at
the time) for an engraving titled “Adam and Eve” that sold in
2011.  That record was broken three times yesterday. First,
another rendition of “Adam and Eve” sold for $662,500 to a
client of Schmelcher’s bidding on the telephone.  ‘Saint Eustace’  A few minutes later, Schulman won an engraving titled
“Saint Eustace” for $722,500. The largest of all Durer
engravings, the circa-1501 work depicts a Roman general kneeling
in front of a stag with a crucifix in its antlers. It once
belonged to the Duke of Devonshire and sold for 190,000 pounds
($281,105) at auction in 1985.  “It’s a beautiful impression,” Schulman said. “Often the
prints are enhanced. This one hasn’t been touched for the past
200 years.”  One of Durer’s most famous images, “Melencolia I” (1514),
went to New York art dealer  Richard Feigen  for $530,500. He was
bidding in the room on behalf of a museum he would describe only
as “not American.”  The biggest casualty was a 1513 engraving, “Knight, Death
and the Devil.” Estimated at $500,000 to $700,000, it failed to
attract a single bid.  Christie’s guaranteed Josefowitz an undisclosed amount for
the collection.  Muse highlights include  Craig Seligman  on  books ,  Rich
Jaroslovsky  on  technology .  To contact the reporters of this story:
