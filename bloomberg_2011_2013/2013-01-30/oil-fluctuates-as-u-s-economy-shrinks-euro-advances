Oil fluctuated in  New York  as the
 U.S. economy  unexpectedly shrank in the fourth quarter and the
euro strengthened against the dollar.  Prices were steady as the Commerce Department reported
gross domestic product dropped at a 0.1 percent annual rate,
weaker than any forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The euro rose
above $1.35 for the first time since December 2011, boosting
dollar-denominated oil’s appeal as an alternative investment.  “The unexpected drop in GDP is a very large surprise and
is what hit the oil market,” said Tom Doremus, an analyst at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “A weakening U.S.
dollar will provide some support to crude prices.”  West Texas Intermediate for March rose 22 cents to $97.79
at 9:31 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading was 27
percent above the 100-day average for the time of day. Oil has
gained 6.5 percent this month.  Brent for March settlement added 19 cents to $114.55 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Trading
was 14 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.
The European benchmark grade’s premium to WTI narrowed 3 cents
to $16.76.  The fourth-quarter GDP showed the worst performance since
the second quarter of 2009, when the world’s largest economy was
still in recession. A decline in government outlays and smaller
gain in stockpiles subtracted a combined 2.6 percentage points
from growth.  Euro Advances  The euro strengthened as much as 0.5 percent to $1.3563
after a report showed  economic confidence  in the region improved
more than analysts predicted this month. The dollar also
weakened as the  Federal Reserve  may renew its commitment to
buying assets during a two-day meeting ended today, according to
a Bloomberg survey of 44 economists.  The Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistics arm, may say today that crude supplies
increased by  2.5 million barrels  last week, according to the
median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Stockpiles  rose  for a fourth week by 4.16 million barrels
to 368.2 million last week, the highest level in more than a
month, the industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
