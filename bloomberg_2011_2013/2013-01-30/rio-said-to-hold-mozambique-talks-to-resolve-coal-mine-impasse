Rio Tinto Group (RIO) ’s head of energy met
with Mozambique government officials this week, two weeks after
a $3 billion writedown on the value of a coal project in
country, according to two people familiar with matter.  Rio’s Harry Kenyon-Slaney, who has been in Mozambique since
Jan. 28, held talks with officials in the Mineral Resources
ministry and the state railway operator as the company seeks
alternative options to transport coal, one of the people said.
Both requested anonymity because the talks are private.  Rio Tinto, the second-biggest mining company, said Jan. 17
it is writing down the value of assets acquired from Riversdale
Mining Ltd. for A$3.9 billion ($4.1 billion) less than two years
after completing the deal.  Mozambique  has so far blocked a plan
put forward by Rio to move coal shipments by barge along the
Zambezi river for export.  Discussions with the government focused on other
possibilities to export the coal from the country and the
evaluation of reserves at the sites, the people said.  A Rio Tinto official in London declined to comment.  Rio Tinto Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese resigned
Jan. 17 as the company announced that it would take about $14
billion in writedowns, largely on the purchase of aluminum
producer Alcan Inc. and the Mozambique coal assets. He was
replaced by Sam Walsh, formerly Rio’s head of iron ore.  To contact the reporters on this story:
