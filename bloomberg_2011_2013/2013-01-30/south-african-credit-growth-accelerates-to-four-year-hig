South African credit  growth 
accelerated to a four-year high in December as the lowest
borrowing costs in more than 30 years fueled demand for loans.  Borrowing by households and companies rose 10.1 percent
from 9.6 percent in November, the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank 
said on its website today. The median  estimate  of 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 9.7 percent.  “Low interest rates are still supporting credit,” Thabi Leoka, head of macro research at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said
in a phone interview from Johannesburg. “Credit uptake in
households could slow, and that’s because of the headwinds that
households are likely to face this year and job losses that will
impact on the ability to take on loans.”  Policy makers have kept the benchmark lending rate at 5
percent since a surprise rate cut in July. The rand’s
depreciation to a four-year low against the dollar is boosting
food and fuel prices, limiting the room policy makers have to
reduce rates further.  The rand pared its loss after the data was released and was
0.2 percent stronger at 9.0115 a dollar at 9:35 a.m. in
Johannesburg. The yield on the rand debt due in 2021 rose 3
basis points to 6.61 percent.  The Reserve Bank last week cut its economic growth forecast
for this year to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent and raised its
estimate for average inflation to 5.8 percent from 5.5 percent.
The  unemployment rate  rose to 25.5 percent in the third quarter.  The broad M3  measure  of  money supply  rose 5.2 percent in
December from a year earlier compared with 6.3 percent in
November, the central bank said. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey was 6.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
