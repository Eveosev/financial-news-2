Serbian natural-gas monopoly
Srbijagas JP wants to buy back 25 percent from  Russia ’s
 Gazprombank OJSC (GZPR)  to balance ownership in the joint venture that
transports and distributes the commodity in the Balkan country.  The share buy-back would restore Srbijagas as a 50 percent
owner of Yugorosgaz AD, alongside  Gazprom OAO (GAZP) , for the first
time since 2005, Srbijagas said in an e-mailed statement today,
citing general manager Dusan Bajatovic. Bajatovic will discuss
the transaction during his “pending visit to Moscow,” it said.  Srbijagas is one of the nation’s unprofitable state-owned
companies that can no longer count on sovereign guarantees for
new borrowing. It has relied on sovereign-backed loans to
bolster liquidity as the government kept gas prices below the
market as three years of an economic decline increased
unemployment and cut disposable incomes.  The company owed more than 60 billion dinars ($727.7
million) to banks at the end of 2011, of which two-thirds were
already long-term loans. It borrowed a total of 390 million
euros ($528.13 million) from banks in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
