Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
biggest carmaker, recalled almost 1.3 million vehicles because
of defects associated with airbags and window wipers.  The company  recalled  901,000 Corolla and Corolla Matrix
vehicles worldwide on concern that a malfunctioning chip could
inadvertently deploy the front-seat airbags or activate the
automatic seat belt restraints, Ryo Sakai, a spokesman for the
Toyota City, Japan-based automaker, said by phone today. About
385,000 Lexus IS cars are also being recalled as their
windshield wipers may not be adequately tightened, he said.  It’s the third time since October that Toyota, which called
back more than 10 million vehicles in 2009 and 2010 for defects
associated with unintended acceleration, has announced a recall
involving more than 1 million vehicles. In October, Toyota
announced a recall involving 7.43 million vehicles followed by
one involving 2.77 million units the next month.  “With more models being shifted into carrying the same
platform, I’m sure that going forward, when recalls happen, they
will be massive like this one,”  Yuuki Sakurai , president of
Fukoku Capital Management Inc. in  Tokyo , said by phone. “The
costs are sure to build up too, because you need to replace the
entire system, not just fix one part.”  In North America, Toyota is aware of 18 incidents involving
the Corolla models where malfunctions may have caused scratches
and detected defects in 46 cases, Sakai said. No accidents or
injuries have been reported related to the Lexus IS recalls,
while the company is aware of 25 cases of defects globally, he
said.  The cars being recalled are the 2003 and 2004 models of the
Corolla and Matrix variant, involving vehicles sold in the U.S.,
 Canada ,  Mexico  and Japan, Toyota said. For the  Lexus  IS, the
company is calling back models from 2006 through 2012 in markets
including the U.S. and Europe, it said.  Toyota rose 0.9 percent to 4,365 yen at the close of
trading in Tokyo, while the benchmark  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
climbed 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
