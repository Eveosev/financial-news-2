CCL Industries Inc. (CCL/B) , a maker of
specialty packaging, agreed to acquire two businesses from  Avery
Dennison  Corp., including its label-printing unit, for $500
million in cash.  A syndicate of banks has committed to provide debt
financing to complete the deal, Toronto-based CCL Industries
said today in a statement.  CCL Chief Executive Officer Geoffrey Martin said the
acquisition is the largest in the companyâ€™s history and bolsters
its labels offerings. The Avery Dennison units had combined
revenue of $910 million last year, according to the statement.  Avery Dennison, based in  Pasadena , California, rose 7.9
percent to $39 at 8:19 a.m. in  New York . CCL was little changed
yesterday at C$45.72 in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
