German wind-turbine installation may
rise as much as 43 percent in 2013 as the home of  Siemens AG (SIE)  and
 Nordex SE (NDX1)  defies a global slump, according to an industry lobby.  Developers may add 3 gigawatts to 3.5 gigawatts after 2.44
gigawatts in 2012 as on and offshore projects grow, said Sylvia
Pilarsky-Grosch, vice president for the BWE lobby.  “We expect significant growth that could be even bigger
depending on the development in the offshore sector,” Thorsten Herdan, head of the manufacturers’ group VDMA Power Systems,
said at the same press conference in Berlin.  Germany  is investing in clean energy as it phases-out
nuclear power. It plans to build offshore wind farms covering an
area as much as six times the size of  New York  City and raise
renewable-energy production to about 40 percent of total power
output by the end of the decade, from about 25 percent now.  Global installations are expected to fall about 9 percent
to 42 gigawatts, led by the U.S., weighing on margins of the
producers, who have about 80 gigawatts of capacity, Herdan said.  While 1.7 gigawatts of offshore  wind turbines  are being
built in the German North Sea, new projects aren’t developing
because delays in connecting the machines to the  power grid  have
unsettled investors, Herdan said. That could lead to a
“gloomy” period for suppliers from 2015, he said.  Germany had 33.33 gigawatts of wind turbines installed by
Dec. 31, including 0.28 gigawatts offshore, the BWE lobby said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
