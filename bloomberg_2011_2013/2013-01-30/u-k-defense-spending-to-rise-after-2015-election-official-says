Prime Minister  David Cameron  intends
to maintain his 2010 commitment to raise defense spending by
more than the rate of inflation if his  Conservative Party  wins
power in 2015, a senior government official said.  His spokeswoman Vickie Sheriff declined to repeat the
premier’s pledge when asked earlier today. The official
subsequently told reporters it remained policy, attributing
speculation to officials’ infighting.  The jousting stems from cuts in the defense budget that
followed 2010 negotiations that sparked open conflict between
the military and Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s
Treasury.  After Cameron entered office in May 2010 the U.K. conducted
a Strategic Defense and Security Review into its future military
capability, while at the same time cutting the defense
ministry’s overall budget and narrowing a 74 billion-pound ($117
billion) deficit.  By 2014-15, the defense ministry’s budget will be 33.5
billion pounds, 8 percent lower than in 2010, before the review.
Announcing the cuts to military programs in October 2010 Cameron
said, “my own strong view is that this structure will require
year on year real-terms growth in the  defense budget  in the
years beyond 2015.”  The official said today the challenges facing the military
hadn’t changed since the 2010 spending review, and that current
overseas commitments were within the levels planned.  Following further cuts of about 500 million pounds
announced to the defense ministry’s budget in December, Defense
Secretary Philip Hammond is fighting to establish his starting
point for the next budget round.  To contact the reporters on this story:
