Euro-area banks decreased three-
month borrowing at the  European Central Bank  even as they
prepare to repay longer-term emergency loans.  Financial institutions took 3.7 billion euros ($5 billion)
in the ECBâ€™s three-month refinancing operation, less than the
6.2 billion euros that expire tomorrow. Interest is linked to
the average ECB benchmark rate, currently at 0.75 percent, over
the period of the loan.  A total of 278 financial institutions are returning 137.2
billion euros in three-year loans today, the first opportunity
for early repayment of the initial longer-term refinancing
operation announced in 2011 when  Europe  faced a credit crunch.
Short-term borrowing from the ECB remained virtually unchanged
yesterday, when banks took 124.1 billion euros in seven-day
funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
