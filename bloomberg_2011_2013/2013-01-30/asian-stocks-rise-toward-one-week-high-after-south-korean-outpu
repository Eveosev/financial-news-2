Asian  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index headed for its highest close since August 2011,
as Japanese shares surged on earnings and amid speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will renew its commitment to asset purchases.  Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689) , owner of the nation’s largest Web
portal, surged 17 percent and  Koito Manufacturing Co. (7276) , an
automobile lighting equipment maker, jumped 10 percent after
raising its full-year profit forecasts.  Yuanta Financial (2885)  Holding
Co. rose 3.9 percent in Taipei after  Taiwan  said it will allow
mainland institutions to invest twice as much in its  securities
market .  Hengdeli Holdings Ltd. (3389)  fell 13 percent in Hong Kong
after Next Magazine reported it may have lost distribution
rights for some Swiss-watch brands.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5 percent to 133.26 as
of 7:33 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than twice as many stocks
climbing as falling. The gauge is poised to advance for a third
month as Japanese shares rally on optimism Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s new government will add stimulus to fight deflation.  “The pain trade is fear that you are going to miss out on
the rally,” said Bob Van Munster, head of Australian equities
at Tyndall Investment Management Ltd. in Sydney, which has about
$24 billion. “We have low  interest rates  and economic tail
risks that are abating. As fear continues to diminish there will
be a rotation into risk assets.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.4 times average estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 12.3 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Nikkei 225  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 2.3 percent, closing
above 11,000 for the first time since April 2010. The broader
Topix Index advanced 1.5 percent after last week capping its
longest weekly winning streak since at least 1973.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  gained 0.2 percent, rising
for a 10th day and capping its longest winning streak since
October 2003.  Taiwan’s  Taiex Index (TWSE)  climbed 0.4 percent. Taiwan will
double the maximum inbound securities investments from China to
$1 billion from $500 million, Huang Tien-mu, Taiwan’s securities
regulator said yesterday. Yuanta Financial rose 3.9 percent to
NT$15.90 in Taipei on the prospect that increased demand for
securities would boost profit.  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  advanced 0.4 percent after the
nation’s industrial output unexpectedly climbed. The Kospi is
one of only two Asian benchmark stock measures to have declined
this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The other
is the  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index (FBMKLCI) , which dropped 0.6 percent
today.  China Bull  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 0.7 percent with trading
volume 23 percent above its 30-day average at the time of day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Shanghai Composite Index gained 1 percent, after
yesterday entering a so-called  bull market . The index has
climbed 21 percent since Dec. 3, when it closed at the lowest
level since Jan. 2009. Some investors define a gain of more than
20 percent from a recent bottom as a bull-market rally.  Of the 1,000 companies listed on the Asian benchmark gauge,
216 are reporting earnings this week, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Of the 79 companies that have posted quarterly
results this year, and for which Bloomberg has estimates, about
half have beaten expectations.  Yahoo Japan surged 17 percent to 37,250 yen after the
company raised its profit forecast for the year ending March,
and after announcing plans to buy back as much as 1.4 percent of
its outstanding shares. Koito Manufacturing jumped 10 percent to
1,494 yen. They were the two  biggest gains  in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index.  Softbank Report  Softbank Corp. advanced 3.6 percent to 3,175 yen after the
Nikkei newspaper reported the mobile phone carrier may report
record operating profit boosted by sales of Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  Central Japan Railway Co. (9022) , a bullet train services
provider, increased 6.6 percent to 8,100 yen after its nine-
month profit surged 49 percent from a year earlier.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today before a
Fed policy decision today at which the central bank is expected
to renew its commitment to asset buying, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of 44 economists.  The measure gained 0.5 percent yesterday to its highest
level since December 2007 on better-than-forecast earnings from
companies including Pfizer Inc. and Valero Energy Corp.  Among stocks that fell, Hengdeli dropped 13 percent to
HK$2.70. Volume surged to more than three times the 12-month
average after the Next Magazine report. The company declined to
comment on the story, Kelly Fung of Porda Havas International
Finance Communication Group, which represents Hengdeli, said by
phone.  ENN Energy Energy Holdings Ltd., a natural gas distributor,
slipped 1.1 percent to HK$37 in  Hong Kong  after saying it plans
to issue $500 million zero coupon bonds convertible to 79.8
million new shares.  Korea Electric Power Corp., South Korea’s monopoly
electricity distributor, dropped 5 percent to 32,100 won in
Seoul. The company isn’t planning any further tariff increases,
Yonhap News reported, citing chief executive officer Cho Hwan
Eik.  To contact the reporters on this story:
