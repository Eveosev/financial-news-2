Alberta ’s government will not
increase taxes in its next fiscal plan even as it faces
declining oil revenue, Premier Alison Redford said.  Speaking to reporters after giving a speech in Toronto,
Redford said “we are not considering at all either health care
premiums or taxes in this budget,” which is scheduled for March
7.  Redford said in a televised address last week that the oil-
rich province will collect C$6 billion ($6 billion) less in
revenue this year because of the low price of Canadian heavy
oil.  “We’re going to have to make some tough choices,” Redford
said today, adding that she didn’t want to “foreshadow”
specific measures to be in the fiscal plan.  Separately, Redford said that New Brunswick Premier David
Alward would visit Alberta next week, and that they would
discuss plans to ship crude to the eastern Canadian province by
reversing existing pipelines. That would allow Alberta oil to
refined and shipped from a deep water port on the Atlantic
Ocean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
