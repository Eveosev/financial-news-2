Soybeans reached a six-week high in
Chicago amid speculation demand for oilseeds from  China , the
world’s largest buyer, will climb to a record this season.  China’s oilseed imports are forecast to rise to 65.3
million metric tons in the year through September from 63.1
million tons in 2011-12, researcher Oil World said yesterday.
Soybean buying will increase to 62 million tons from 59.2
million tons, it predicted.  “Chinese authorities have been buying up domestic supplies
since November,” Joyce Liu, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte,
said by phone from  Singapore . “That has been buoying soybean
demand,” along with “high crushing margins as well as rising
demand for soybean oil and soybean meal,” Liu said.  Soybeans for delivery in March added 1.2 percent to $14.69
a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 12:13 p.m. Paris time.
Prices touched $14.6975, the highest level for a most-active
contract since Dec. 18, and climbed for a fourth session. The
oilseed is up 4.2 percent in January, set for the first monthly
advance since August.  Rain delaying Brazil’s harvest and shipments and dry
weather cutting yield potential in  Argentina  may boost U.S.
exports before  South America  dominates global trade, Societe
Generale SA analyst Christopher Narayanan said yesterday.  Wheat for delivery in March rose 0.5 percent to $7.81 a
bushel, erasing a drop of as much as 0.7 percent. Milling wheat
for delivery the same month traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris was
unchanged at 247.50 euros ($335.53) a ton.  Corn for delivery in March added 1 percent to $7.3675 a
bushel in Chicago, on course for a fourth gain in five.  To contact the reporter on this story:
