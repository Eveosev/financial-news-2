economy,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at Bank of
Singapore Ltd. “The  yuan  fixing has been stable, a sign that
China is not in a hurry to appreciate its currency.”  The yuan gained 0.06 percent to 6.2204 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.

according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
32 economists. The National Bureau of Statistics and China
