Chile ’s Supreme Court today agreed
to seek the extradition of a Florida resident accused of
participating in the 1973 murder of folk singer Victor Jara
following a military coup in the South American nation.  In a unanimous decision, the judges decided to ask U.S. to
extradite Pedro Pablo Barrientos for his alleged role in killing
the artist whose folk songs include “Prayer to a Worker” and
“ I Remember You Amanda .” Jara was shot 44 times while being
held in military custody at Chile’s national stadium in the days
after  Augusto Pinochet  seized power on Sept. 11, 1973.  The judiciary last month ordered the arrest of Barrientos
and fellow former Chilean military officer Hugo Sanchez for
their alleged role in the murder. Chilean courts in the past two
years have stepped up investigations of human rights abuses
carried out during the 17-year dictatorship, including a probe
into the death of former President Salvador Allende.  “Given the nature of the facts being investigated, there
is no doubt whatsoever that the light of international
humanitarian law must be cast,” according to the Supreme Court
resolution posted on the judiciary  website  today.  Barrientos and Sanchez couldn’t be reached for comment by
 Bloomberg News  because their contact information wasn’t
