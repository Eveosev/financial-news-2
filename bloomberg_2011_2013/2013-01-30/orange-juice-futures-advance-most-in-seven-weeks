Orange-juice futures jumped the most
in seven weeks on concern that a crop disease will curb output
in  Florida , the world’s second-biggest citrus grower. Cotton
also rose.  On Jan. 11, the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its
estimate for Florida’s orange output as citrus greening, a
bacterial disease, damaged groves. Prices have climbed 4.8
percent since the day before the government report.  “The bullish case is all about greening,”  Shawn Hackett ,
the president of Hackett Financial Advisors Inc. in Boynton
Beach, Florida, said in an e-mail.  Orange juice for March delivery surged 3 percent to $1.1775
a pound at 11:12 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. A close
at that price would mark the biggest gain for a most-active
contract since Dec. 12.  “We are still seeing continued fruit drop,” Dean Mixon,
the president of Mixon Fruit Farms Inc., a grower in Bradenton,
Florida, said in an e-mail.  The USDA will update its Florida forecast on Feb. 8.  Brazil 
is the biggest orange producer.  Cotton futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to 82.79
cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
