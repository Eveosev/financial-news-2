United Bankshares Inc., the largest
lender based in  West Virginia , agreed to buy  Virginia Commerce
Bancorp Inc. (VCBI)  for $491 million to expand around  Washington .  Virginia Commerce investors will receive 0.5442 shares of
Parkersburg-based United Bankshares for every one of theirs,
valuing the takeover-target’s stock at about $14, the companies
said today in a statement. The transaction is set to be
completed in the third quarter.  Virginia Commerce, which paid back government bailout funds
last month, has $2.8 billion in assets, according to the
statement. Focusing on the Northern Virginia suburbs of
Washington, it has 28 banking offices, as well as one
residential mortgage-origination office and one wealth-
management office.  The deal “creates the leading independent community bank
operating throughout the most attractive markets in Northern
Virginia and Washington,” United Bankshares Chief Executive
Officer Richard Adams said in the statement. “VCBI is a well-
run banking franchise and will be a great partner.”  United Bankshares fell 1.4 percent to $25.47 at 10:49 a.m.
in  New York  trading. Arlington-based Virginia Commerce rose
7 percent to $13.07, the highest since October 2007.  Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP and law firm Troutman Sanders
LLP advised Virginia Commerce. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. and
law firm Bowles Rice LLP advised United Bankshares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
