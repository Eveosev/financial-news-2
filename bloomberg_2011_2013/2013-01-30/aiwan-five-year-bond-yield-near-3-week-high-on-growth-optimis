Taiwan ’s five-year bond yield was
near the highest level in almost three weeks as signs of an
economic pickup in the region damped demand for the safety of
sovereign debt. The local dollar was little changed.  The island’s economy grew 3 percent last quarter from a
year earlier, after a 0.98 percent expansion in the previous
three months, a Bloomberg survey of economists showed before a
report due tomorrow. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares
headed for the highest close since August 2011 after data showed
South Korea’s factory output  unexpectedly  rose 1 percent in
December from a month earlier. Taiwan’s bond and stock markets
will be closed for Lunar New Year holidays starting Feb. 7.  “An improving economic outlook has led to bearish
sentiment in the  bond market ,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income
trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “Some traders are
also clearing their positions before the holiday.”  The yield on Taiwan’s 0.875 percent government bonds due
January 2018 was at 0.91 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. Benchmark  five-year  rates touched 0.911 percent
yesterday, the highest level since Jan. 11.  The Taiwan dollar was at NT$29.57 against its U.S.
counterpart, compared with NT$29.559 yesterday, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.70 yesterday, the weakest
level since Sept. 14. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
41 basis points to 4.52 percent.  The central bank sold its currency to counter gains during
the final minutes of trading on most days in the past 10 months,
according to traders, who asked not to be identified.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.388
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
