New York Rangers captain  Ryan
Callahan  scored the decisive goal before leaving the ice with an
arm injury during a 2-1 victory over the  Philadelphia Flyers  in
the National Hockey League.  Michael Del Zotto got the opening goal for the Rangers in
the first period before Callahan doubled the advantage on a
power play in the second period at Madison Square Garden in New
York last night. Kimmo Timonen got Philadelphiaâ€™s goal on a
power play midway through the third period.  Callahan left the game with a left-arm problem following a
clash with Max Talbot in the third period.  It was the third straight home victory for the Rangers, who
are eighth in the Eastern Conference.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
