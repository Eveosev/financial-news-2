Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH started
testing a version of  Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s top-selling drug Rituxan
for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, broadening the possible uses the
German company sees for its copy of the medicine.  Boehringer is already recruiting patients in another trial
of the drug in rheumatoid arthritis and adding an indication in
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a type of cancer, may help increase
sales, Asthika Goonewardene, a London-based analyst for
Bloomberg Industries, said in a note to clients today.  “Boehringer’s efficient clinical program may generate the
data required to file for regulatory approval in both the U.S.
and EU for the two key indications which account for more than
90 percent of Rituxan sales,” Goonewardene wrote.  Boehringer is seeking to enter a crowded field of potential
competitors. Novartis AG, Celltrion Inc., partners Samsung
Electronics Co. and Quintiles Transnational Corp., and  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  with  Lonza Group AG (LONN)  are among the
companies already working on a Rituxan copy. Some of the
companies have had setbacks in developing a Rituxan copy,
