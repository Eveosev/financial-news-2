Emitters in the Chinese city of
Shenzhen may choose to relocate as the city introduces a cap-
and-trade program to limit  greenhouse gases .   Companies may go elsewhere as the cost of their carbon
emissions cuts profitability, Ge Xing’an, vice president at the
Shenzhen Emission Exchange, said yesterday at a conference in
 Hong Kong . Ge predicts the fallout from businesses leaving would
be offset by new companies that can benefit as emitters try to
reduce greenhouse gases linked to  climate change .  Shenzhen is one of seven manufacturing areas in China
scheduled to start pilot programs this year for carbon trading.
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin, Chongqing and Hubei are
the other participants in a network that Bloomberg New Energy
Finance forecasts will regulate 800 million to 1 billion tons of
emissions by 2015. That would be the world’s biggest cap-and-
trade program after the one in Europe.   Shenzhen predicts more than 800 companies will participate
in its emissions program when trading begins later this year.
The city will meet the 2013 start-up deadline, Ge said.  Former Chinese leader  Deng Xiaoping  chose Shenzhen in the
1970s as one of the nation’s proving grounds for market
capitalism. That transformed a county of 30,000 people north of
Hong Kong into one of China’s largest cities. Shenzhen had a
population of more than 11 million as of the 2010 census.  To contact the reporter on this story:
