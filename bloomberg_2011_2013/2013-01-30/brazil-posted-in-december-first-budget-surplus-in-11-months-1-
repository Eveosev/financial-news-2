Brazil  posted in December its first
monthly budget surplus in 11 months after the government tapped
its sovereign wealth fund and profits from state companies to
improve its fiscal results.  Federal and local governments, including state companies,
had a a budget surplus of 3.2 billion reais ($1.6 billion) in
December, up from a 21.8 billion reais deficit in November, the
central bank said in a report today in Brasilia. The first
budget surplus since January 2011 narrowed the annual gap to
108.9 billion reais, the central bank said.  President Dilma Rousseff’s administration had to resort to
“fiscal maneuvers” this year to meet its fiscal goals after
cutting taxes and boosting public spending in a bid to revive
the slowest growth in three years, said Felipe Salto, an
economist at Tendencias Consultoria Integrada. To achieve its
budget surplus before interest payment target of 139.8 billion
reais for 2012 it will have to abate some investments from the
goal, even after withdrawing 12.4 billion reais from its wealth
fund. The moves are in line with budget laws.  “The government is only meeting its target because of
fiscal maneuvers,” Salto said in an interview from Sao Paulo.
“If the government continues to use these tools, the perception
of risk will increase and it will be harder for the government
to finance itself.”  The so-called primary surplus widened to 104.95 billion
reais in the 12 months through December, compared with 82.70
billion reais a month earlier, the central bank said. The
government will reduce 34.9 billion reais in investments from
its target, meeting its 2012 goal, Fernando Rocha, the deputy-
chief of the central bank’s economic research department said.  Rocha forecast the country’s net debt will fall in 2013 to
33.2 percent of gross domestic product from 35.1 percent last
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
