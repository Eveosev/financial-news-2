Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  Chief Executive
Officer Al Monaco said he is “concerned” about the impact of
discounted Canadian crude on  oil-sands  investment.  “We need to attract world prices to promote investment in
the oil sands,” Monaco said today in  Edmonton ,  Alberta . “We
don’t want price discounts to affect investment.”  Canadian companies are forgoing about C$2.5 billion ($2.5
billion) a month because of the lower prices, according to an
estimate by Houston-based investment bank PPHB Securities LP.
The discount has eroded Canadian oil profits and reduced tax
revenues for Alberta, the bank said.  Investment in oil sands is made with long-term
considerations, said Alberta Finance Minister Doug Horner, who
attended the presentation, in an interview. The province expects
the differential to diminish with the addition of new pipeline
capacity, he said.  “Obviously, that is a concern that we have,” Horner said.
“But there is a growing movement of market adjustments that
will turn around the differential.”  Enbridge is investing C$15 billion over the next three
years to add capacity for 1 million barrels of Alberta crude,
Monaco said. Among projects the pipeline operator is developing
are Northern Gateway, to ship oil to the Pacific, as well as a
reversal of an existing line from Ontario to  Quebec , home to
several refineries.  Refiners could decide to ship processed crude to other
markets if they find customers, Monaco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
