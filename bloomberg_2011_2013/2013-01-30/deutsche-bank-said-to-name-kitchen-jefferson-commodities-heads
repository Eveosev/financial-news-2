Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  named Louise Kitchen and Richard Jefferson as co-heads of commodities,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Both are based in London and are replacing David Silbert,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information hasn’t been announced yet.  Kitchen was previously global head of commodities
structuring and sales and Jefferson was head of commodity sales,
the person said. They report to Jeff Mayer, head of corporate
banking and securities for North America, the person said.  Deutsche Bank,  Europe ’s biggest bank by assets, will
probably post a loss in the fourth quarter as restructuring
aimed at boosting profitability and financial strength
contributed to a surge in costs. The bank may report a loss of
210 million euros ($282 million) after a year-earlier 147
million-euro profit when it releases results tomorrow, according
to the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Frankfurt-based bank was dismissing power and gas
traders in the U.S. as part of the 1,900 job cuts announced by
Chief Executive OfficerAnshu Jain in July, a person briefed on
the matter said last month. Silbert was preparing to leave, the
person then said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
