Bank lending conditions in  emerging
markets  improved for the first time in more than a year as
accommodative central bank policies made funding easier, the
Institute of International Finance said.  An index tracking lending conditions in developing nations
rose to 50.5 in the fourth quarter of 2012, from 49.9 in the
preceding three months and 48.6 in the second quarter, according
to a survey released today by the institute, which represents
some of the world’s largest commercial banks and financial
firms. The index has been below 50 for five straight quarters, a
reading that shows conditions are worsening.  “International funding conditions for banks in emerging
market economies continued to ease significantly in the fourth
quarter of 2012, reflecting the very easy monetary policy in
mature economies,” the Washington-based IIF said in a
statement. “Similarly, domestic funding conditions have eased
substantially as the monetary policy in emerging economies
remained highly accommodative. Banks in emerging  Europe  and
Latin America have particularly benefited from that trend.”  While funding eased the conditions on the supply side, loan
demand continued to weaken and credit standards were tightened
as non-performing loans continued to increase, especially in
emerging Europe and Asia, the IIF said.  The survey was conducted among 141 banks between mid-
December and mid-January, the IIF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
