The main water treatment plant in
 Brisbane ,  Australia ’s third-most populous city, restarted after
floods forced it to close and sparked concern over shortages.  “Production levels at the plant have continued to increase
this morning, however the water supply and demand balance
remains tight,” according to a statement today on the website
of  Seqwater , the Queensland government utility that manages
water supplies in the southeast of the state.  The Mount Crosby Water Treatment Plant is the region’s
largest and supplies most of the drinking water to Brisbane,
Ipswich and Logan. About 2.15 million people reside in the
metropolitan Brisbane area. Seqwater and Queensland Premier
Campbell Newman have continued to urge residents to conserve
water supplies and use only what’s necessary.  The facility was off-line due to “record turbidity
levels” in the Brisbane River, following the passage of
Tropical Cyclone Oswald, Seqwater said yesterday. Thousands of
people were evacuated and hundreds more are isolated by
floodwaters in rural settlements across the states of Queensland
and New South Wales after the storm brought devastating winds
and heavy rain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
