Sweden ’s krona jumped to a four-
month high against its Norwegian counterpart after economic
reports showed diverging economic momentum in the two largest
Nordic economies.  The krona appreciated as much as 0.35 percent to 1.1552
against the krone, the strongest level since Oct. 2, and traded
at 1.1577 as of 3:08 p.m. in  Stockholm .  Swedish  consumer confidence  improved to minus 2.9 in
January, beating a minus 8.8 estimate of 10 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg, while Norwegian survey unemployment unexpectedly
rose to 3.5 percent in November from 3.3 percent. A central bank
survey showed last month that Norwegian companies expect weaker
economic growth over the next six months.  “The risk attached to the krone has increased,” Nils Kristian Knudsen, an analyst at Svenska Handelsbanken AB, said
by phone from Oslo. “In light of the better than expected
numbers out of Sweden and still weak numbers out of  Norway , we
could see some continuation of this move.”  The krone and the krona have strengthened as the two AAA
rated Nordic economies emerged as havens from  Europe ’s crisis.
Sweden’s economy may benefit more from a European recovery than
neighboring Norway, whose petroleum wealth has so far shielded
western Europe’s largest oil exporter from the fallout of the
euro area debt crisis.  Increased optimism in Germany tends to favor an
appreciation of the krona versus the Norwegian currency, which
may drop further if Norway’s retail sales and registered
unemployment data due later this week are weaker than expected,
Knudsen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
