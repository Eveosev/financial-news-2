A  JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  plane and an
Air India Ltd. aircraft bumped into each other on a taxiway at
New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, causing some
damage to the JetBlue plane’s rudder.  JetBlue Flight 145 had pushed back from the gate and its
tow bar was being worked on when the Air India aircraft, en
route to its gate, bumped the JetBlue craft, said JetBlue
spokesman Alex Headrick. No one was injured in the incident,
which occurred at 6:15 a.m. local time.  New York’s WABC-TV reported the Air India plane had some
wingtip damage.  The Jet Blue passengers, bound for  West Palm Beach ,
Florida, were boarded onto another aircraft that left at 9:43
a.m., according to  JetBlue’s  website. A phone call placed to Air
India in New York went unanswered.  For Related News and Information:
