The Canadian dollar weakened for a
fifth week against its U.S peer, its longest skid since June, as
the  Bank of Canada  indicated it won’t raise  interest rates 
anytime soon with inflation slowing more than forecast.  The currency pared its weekly decline yesterday after the
economies of  Canada  and the U.S. posted stronger-than-forecast
employment gains, increasing risk appetite. The so-called loonie
fell earlier this week as central-bank Governor  Mark Carney 
softened language about tighter policy, saying inflation will
“remain low in the near term.” Gains in new  home prices  slowed
in January, according a Bloomberg News survey before the
report’s March 14 release.  “With the direction the Bank of Canada is implying to the
market, we are looking for the Canadian dollar to weaken off in
the coming months,”  John Curran , senior vice president at
Canadianforex Ltd., an online foreign-exchange dealer, said by
phone in Toronto yesterday. The boost from the employment
reports is “going to be a short-term plus,” he said.  The loonie, as Canada’s dollar is nicknamed for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.2 percent to
C$1.0287 per  U.S. dollar  this week in Toronto. It touched
C$1.0337, close to the eight-month low of C$1.0342. One Canadian
dollar buys 97.21 U.S. cents.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bond fell, with
yields rising 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 1.93
percent. It was the biggest advance since the week ended Jan. 4.
The 2.75 security maturing in June 2022 fell C$1.19 to C$106.88.  The Bank of Canada will auction C$1.5 billion ($1.46
billion) of 30-year bonds on March 13. The 3.5 percent
securities will mature in December 2045.  Loonie Bulls  Futures traders increased their bets that the Canadian
dollar will decline against the U.S. dollar to the highest level
since March 2007, figures from the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the Canadian dollar
compared with those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was
46,663 on March 5, compared with net shorts of 21,433 a week
earlier. That’s the most net-shorts since March 2007.  At the same time, options traders became more bullish on
the Canadian dollar during the past week. The three-month 25-
delta risk reversal rate, which measures the premium charged for
the right to buy the U.S. dollar against the loonie versus
contracts to sell, traded at 1.3 yesterday, down 7.1 percent
this week. It hit 1.5 on Feb. 26, the highest since Sept. 7, and
has averaged 1.07 this year.  Jobs Gains  Canadian employment rose by 50,700 last month, more than
double the highest prediction in a Bloomberg News survey with 22
responses and a median estimate of 8,000. The jobless rate
remained at 7 percent, the lowest since December 2008, while
economists predicted it would rise to 7.1 percent.  Employment in the U.S. increased 236,000 last month after a
revised 119,000 gain in January that was smaller than first
estimated, Labor Department figures showed in  Washington . The
median forecast of 90 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected
an advance of 165,000. The jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent
from 7.9 percent.  “The dual employment reports, the Canadian and U.S.
reports, led the Canadian dollar to surge in the face of a
stronger U.S. dollar against the rest of the major currencies,”
Greg T. Moore, a currency strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,
said yesterday by phone from Toronto.  ‘Hawkish Bias’  The loonie declined 0.5 percent on March 6 after the
central bank kept its benchmark rate at 1 percent even as Carney
retained the bias that rates will rise over time. He has warned
in every policy decision since April that rates could go up,
making him the lone Group of Seven central banker who has
indicated he might raise interest rates.  “One data point isn’t going to change the Bank of Canada
outlook,” Adam Button, a currency analyst at Forexlive.com in
 Montreal , said of the jobs report yesterday by phone. “But the
BOC will be glad that they left a slight hawkish bias.”  New home prices  rose 0.1 percent in January on a monthly
basis, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists, after a
0.2 percent gain in December.  The loonie has fallen 3.1 percent during the past six
months among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. dollar has
gained 2.4 percent and the euro has surged 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
