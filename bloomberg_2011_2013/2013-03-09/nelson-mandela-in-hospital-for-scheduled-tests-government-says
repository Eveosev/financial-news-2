Former South African President
 Nelson Mandela  has been admitted to hospital in Pretoria “for a
scheduled medical check-up to manage existing conditions in line
with his age,” according to a statement on President  Jacob
Zuma ’s official website.  “Doctors are conducting tests and have thus far indicated
that there is no reason for any alarm,” the government said in
its statement.  In January, the government said Mandela, 94, had recovered
from surgery he’d had the previous month and a bout of a
recurring lung infection.  The Nobel Peace Prize winner, who became the country’s
first black president after the all-race elections that ended
apartheid in 1994, was admitted to a hospital on Dec. 8 and
discharged Dec. 26.  In February 2012 he was hospitalized after undergoing
abdominal surgery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
