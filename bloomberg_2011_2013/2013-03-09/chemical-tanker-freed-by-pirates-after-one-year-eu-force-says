MV Royal Grace, a chemical tanker,
was released by Somali pirates and is heading for Muscat, Oman,
the European Union Naval Force said in a statement on its
website today.  The pirates had held the vessel after attacking it in March
last year in the  Gulf of Oman , the EU said. ESPS Mendez Nunez,
the EUâ€™s vessel, spotted Royal Grace 20 nautical miles off the
northern Somali coast yesterday, the EU Naval Force said. The
tanker has a 20-man crew, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
