Aston Villa beat Reading 2-1 to move
out of English soccer’s Premier League relegation zone, while
bottom-place Queens Park Rangers defeated Sunderland 3-1 for a
second consecutive win.  West Bromwich Albion beat Swansea 2-1, while Artur Boruc
saved a penalty kick in stoppage time to preserve Southampton’s
goalless draw at Norwich.  Christian Benteke and  Gabriel Agbonlahor  scored as Villa
won for only the second time since mid-December. The victory
moves Villa up to 17th in the 20-team standings with 27 points
and drops Wigan, which beat Everton 3-0 in the F.A. Cup
quarterfinals earlier today, into the three relegation spots
with 24 points.  Reading falls into a tie with QPR on 23 points and the same
goal difference. Loci Remy, Andros Townsends and Jermaine Jenas
scored as QPR won back-to-back games for the first time this
season.  Steven Fletcher  had the goal for Sunderland, which is
winless in six matches.  West Brom moved up two spots to seventh place after beating
Swansea on Jonathan de Guzman’s own goal in the 61st minute.
Romalu Lukaku also scored for the Baggies, while Luke Moore had
the Swansea goal.  Southampton earned the draw in Norwich as Boruc dived to
his right to stop  Grant Holt ’s penalty, which was awarded after
referee Mark Clattenburg ruled the striker was knocked over by
Luke Shaw just inside the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
