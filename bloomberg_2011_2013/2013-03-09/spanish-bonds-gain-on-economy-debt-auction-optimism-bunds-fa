Spanish government bonds advanced
for a fourth week and German bunds fell as borrowing costs
dropped at Spain’s debt sale and European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi said the region’s economy will improve this year.  Gains yesterday pushed Spain’s  five- and 10-year yields  to
the lowest since November 2010 as reports showed the nation’s
industrial production shrank less than economists predicted and
U.S. payrolls jumped more than forecast in February. German bund
yields rose to the most in over a week as U.S. employers added
more jobs than forecast in February.  Portugal ’s  10-year bonds 
had their biggest weekly gain in two months after Standard &
Poor’s raised the nation’s credit-rating outlook.  “A positive set of Spanish auctions provides further
reassurance that supply is not providing much in the way of
market concerns,” said Richard McGuire, a senior fixed-income
strategist at Rabobank International in  London . “Draghi
continues to believe an improvement in financial markets will
filter through to the real economy, which is risk positive and
may have served to underpin sentiment.”  Spanish  10-year yields  dropped 34 basis points, or 0.34
percentage point this week, to 4.76 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday, when it reached 4.75 percent, the least since
Nov. 23, 2010. The 5.4 percent bond maturing in January 2023
rose 2.625, or 26.25 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,299) face amount,
to 104.93.  The five-year yield fell 32 basis points from March 1 to
3.44 percent yesterday, when it dropped to 3.42 percent, the
least since Nov. 4, 2010.  Economic Recovery  “Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover,
supported by a strengthening global backdrop and our
accommodative monetary policy stance,” Draghi told a press
conference in  Frankfurt  on March 7 after an ECB policy meeting.
Officials kept the main refinancing rate unchanged at a record
low 0.75 percent.  Italy’s  10-year yield  declined 19 basis points to 4.60
percent, still higher than before the nation’s inconclusive Feb.
24-25 elections. The benchmark yield was 4.45 percent on Feb.
22, the last trading day before the vote.  Spain auctioned 5.03 billion euros of debt on March 7. The
Madrid-based Treasury allotted 2.44 billion euros of 10-year
bonds at an average yield of 4.917 percent, the lowest since
November 2010. It also sold 2015 and 2018 notes.  Benchmark German  bonds  may extend their drop as economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a report will show consumer
prices in the euro area rose 0.4 percent last month from
January, when they slumped 1 percent. The European Union’s
statistics office in  Luxembourg  will release the data on March
15. From a year earlier, inflation stayed at 1.8 percent,
according to a separate survey.  German 10-year bund yields rose 12 basis points to 1.53
percent after reaching 1.54 percent, the most since Feb. 25.  Spanish government bonds returned 3.8 percent this year
through March 7, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italy’s
securities advanced 0.2 percent, while German bunds lost 0.8
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
