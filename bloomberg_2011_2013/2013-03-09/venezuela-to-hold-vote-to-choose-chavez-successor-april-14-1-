Venezuela  will hold a special
presidential election to select Hugo Chavez’s successor on April
14, the National Electoral Council said.  Candidates have until the afternoon of March 11 to
register, council President Tibisay Lucena said in televised
remarks. Council members decided on the time frames today after
holding a minute of silence for Chavez, who died March 5, she
said.  “The republic is going through difficult times,” she
said. “It’s fundamental to recognize the historic relevance of
the path we’re about to go down, and its importance to the
stability and strengthening of our democracy.”  Chavez’s handpicked heir, acting President  Nicolas Maduro ,
will run. The opposition will rally around a single candidate,
Miranda state Governor Henrique Capriles Radonski, the
opposition alliance, known as the Democratic Unity Table, said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Capriles thanked the opposition for its proposal in a
comment on his Twitter account, adding that he will speak
publicly about his decision in “coming hours.”  The governor in the October presidential election lost to
Chavez by 11 percentage points. Maduro enjoys a 46.4 percent to
34.3 percent advantage over Capriles, according to a survey
taken Jan. 31 to Feb. 20 by Caracas-based polling company
Datanalisis. The poll has a margin of error of 2.4 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
