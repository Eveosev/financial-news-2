AT&T Inc. plans to buy a bit more
than 25 percent of billionaire  Mukesh Ambani ’s Reliance Jio
Infocomm Ltd. for $3.5 billion, the Times of India newspaper
reported today, without saying where it got the information.  The deal may be the largest foreign direct investment in
India and would value the yet-to-start telecommunications
company at $14 billion, the report said.  Tushar Pania, a spokesman for Ambani-led  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL) , declined to comment on the report to Bloomberg
News. Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&T in Atlanta, also
declined to comment.  Production from the KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal,
India’s biggest natural gas deposit, has been falling for more
than two years, leading to declines in profit at Mumbai-based
Reliance in four of the last five quarters. Reliance, which owns
the world’s largest oil refining complex, is trying to raise its
revenue by diversifying.  Reliance Jio plans to break even and become  India ’s biggest
telecommunications company within three years of starting its
services, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
