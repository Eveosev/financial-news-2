Chinese Foreign Minister  Yang Jiechi 
said articles blaming  China ’s government for hacking are on
“shaky ground” and have fabrications, and said Asia’s biggest
economy is opposed to turning cyberspace into a “new
battlefield.”  “We oppose turning cyberspace into a new battlefield or
using the Internet as a new tool to interfere in the internal
affairs of other nations,” Yang told reporters today at a press
conference during the National People’s Congress in Beijing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
