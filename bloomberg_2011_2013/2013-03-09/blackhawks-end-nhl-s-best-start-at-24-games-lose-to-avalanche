The  Chicago Blackhawks  ended the
best start in a National Hockey League season at 24 games when
they fell 6-2 to the  Colorado Avalanche .  The Blackhawks recorded at least one point in each of their
first 24 games this season. They surpassed the previous record
of 16 games held by the Anaheim Ducks, who started 12-0-4 in the
2006-07 season when they won the  Stanley Cup .  “We were fortunate to play well enough to make it this far
and it’s something we can be proud of,” captain  Jonathan Toews 
told reporters. “We’ll take the confidence we gained from all
that and keep going forward. Everyone knows you can’t win them
all.”  The Blackhawks, who had their franchise-record 11-game
winning streak broken, are 21-1-3 to lead the league with 45
points. Colorado improved to 9-10-4 for 22 points.  Toews gave the Blackhawks a 1-0 lead five minutes, 44
seconds into the first period with Paul Stastny scoring on a
power play to tie the game with 3 ½ minutes left in the period
last night at the Pepsi Center in Denver.  Colorado monopolized the second period with goals by Matt Duchene,  John Mitchell , Ryan O’Reilly and Jamie McGinn for a 5-1
advantage.  Bryan Bickell gave the Blackhawks their second goal midway
through the fourth period and P.A. Parenteau added the
Avalanche’s sixth with just over four minutes left in the game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
