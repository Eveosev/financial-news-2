Sandstorms are affecting provinces
across northern China including  Inner Mongolia  and Hebei, the
official forecaster said, warning airports, highway users and
ports to take safety measures as visibility drops.  As many as nine provinces have been hit as winds moving
eastward from Xinjiang to Beijing and Tianjin whip up dust, the
National Meteorological Center said on its  website  today.
Temperatures may fall by as much as 14 degrees Centigrade, and
heavy snow is forecast in Heilongjiang and Jilin, it said.  Sandy and dusty weather is a frequent event during spring
in China, especially in March and April, with four occurrences
this year, the forecaster said. Citizens in the affected areas
should avoid going outside, or wear masks if they do, it said.  The cold front will spread to regions north of the lower-
Yangtze River basin, the forecaster said. The chill followed a
surge in heat yesterday, when temperatures in some provincial
capitals had reached the highest on record for the first 10 days
of March, it said.  At Beijing Capital Airport, some flights were delayed,
while a section of the roof over Terminal Three was partially
lifted off by a gust of wind, the airport said on its official
 Weibo ,  China â€™s Twitter-like social-media service.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
