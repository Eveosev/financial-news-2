Adrian Gonzalez  hit a two-run homer
to help Mexico defeat the U.S. 5-2 in a World Baseball Classic
game in Phoenix.  U.S. pitcher R.A. Dickey allowed two runs in the first
inning and two more in the third as Mexico took an early four-
run lead.  Yovani Gallardo got the win, allowing one run on two hits
and striking out four in 3 1/3 innings. Sergio Romo pitched a
perfect ninth inning for the save. Dickey gave up four runs on
six hits and struck out two in four innings.  The U.S. has a must-win game today against Italy, which
defeated Canada 14-4 yesterday. In the other first-round game,
 Puerto Rico  beat Spain 3-0.  In the double-elimination second-round game yesterday,
Japan topped Chinese Taipei 4-3 in 10 innings.  The championship game is March 19 at AT&T Park in  San
Francisco .  To contact the reporter on this story:
