German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said a U.K. exit from the European Union would be
disastrous,  Der Standard  reported, citing an interview.  Schaeuble suggested it would be hard to tell non-Europeans
that the EU is a strong, dynamic bloc if a globally oriented
country such as the U.K. left, the Vienna, Austria-based
newspaper said. The damage to  Europe ’s image alone “would be a
catastrophe,” Schaeuble was quoted as saying.  Even so, EU measures to cap bonuses for bankers, which the
U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron’s government opposes, won’t be
withdrawn or watered down, Schaeuble was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
