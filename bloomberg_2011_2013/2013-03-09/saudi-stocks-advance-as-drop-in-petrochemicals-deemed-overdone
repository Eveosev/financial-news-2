Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
climbed to the highest level in more than a week as investors
deemed a drop in petrochemical stocks was overdone after better-
than-expected U.S. jobs data.  Saudi Industrial Investment Group (SIIG)  advanced the most in
almost a year on volume of 1.4 times the three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Saudi Arabian
Fertilizer Co., or Safco, rose to the highest level since Dec
23. The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.4 percent to 7,027.49,
the strongest since Feb. 25, at the close in Riyadh.  Volume on the Saudi bourse increased to 172 million shares
today, the most in more than a week, after data showed U.S.
employment rose 236,000 last month. The  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  rose within 1 percent of a record high after the figure
beat the median 165,000 forecast of 90 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The Saudi  petrochemicals index  climbed 0.7 percent
today, having fallen to a 2013 low on March 4.  Saudi stocks were “supported by the increase in the
petrochemical sector coming after positive U.S. job market data
released on Friday,” Turki Fadaak, head of research and
consultancy at Albilad Investment Co., said by e-mail today.
“This led to an increase in the demand for petrochemicals”
after last week’s lows, he said.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse that trades on Saturdays. Saudi Industrial jumped 2.7
percent, the most since April 28, to 22.75 riyals. Safco
increased 1 percent to 156.50 riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
