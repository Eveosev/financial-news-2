An Indonesian-registered vessel sank
in Singapore waters after colliding with a ferry this morning,
triggering a search and rescue operation for one missing crew
member, according to the Maritime and Port Authority.  The Budi Jasa 18 was involved in a collision with Sea Hawk,
a ferry carrying 200 passengers, in the West Keppel Fairway, the
authority  said  in a statement. While other vessels have been
ordered to keep clear of the search-and-rescue area, port
operations are not affected, according to the statement.  Divers and four maritime and police coast guard craft have
been activated for the operation, it said. Five crew from the
Budi Jasa 18, described as a coaster craft, were rescued, with
one reported missing, it said.  Eight people on the Sea Hawk, which was traveling to
Singapore’s Bukom Island, suffered injuries, the authority said.
The authority received a report about the sinking at 6:25 a.m.
local time.  Singapore, a city-state at the southern end of the Malacca
Strait, is home to the world’s second-busiest container port.  To contact the reporter on this story:
