The Japanese government’s move to
purchase disputed islands in the East  China  Sea damaged the
post-World War II order and  Japan  “singlehandedly” caused
increased tensions between the two countries, Chinese Foreign
Minister Yang Jiechi said.  The two countries both claim the islands, known as Senkaku
in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. Yang said Japan must make
“concrete efforts” to improve ties with China. Yang spoke at a
briefing at China’s National People’s Congress in Beijing today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
