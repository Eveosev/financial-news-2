Six magnums of Montrachet Grand Cru
Burgundy representing each of the vintages between 2005 and 2010
will feature with vintage Rhone and Bordeaux wines at a
Christie’s International Plc auction in  London  this month.  The Montrachet lot carries the sale’s top estimate of as
much as 72,000 pounds ($108,000), according to the online
catalog. Five bottles of Hermitage La Chapelle 1961 Rhone have a
top estimate of 35,000 pounds while a half-case of Chateau
Latour 1961 Pauillac is priced at as much as 30,000 pounds.  The sale comes as wine prices have revived over the past
four months, after the London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index
touched its lowest level for 32 months in November. It has
rallied 10 percent since then, including 2.9 percent last month,
and in January had its biggest monthly gain for two years as
collectors sought wines neglected during the financial crisis.  Bordeaux wines in the sale from the right-bank region of
Pomerol, which are also estimated to feature in the top 10 lots,
include six magnums of Chateau Petrus 1986 priced at as much as
15,000 pounds.  Two lots each of 24 half-bottles of Petrus, one from 1979
and the other from 1981, are each estimated to fetch 12,000
pounds, while a case of Le Pin 1986 may fetch as much as 10,000
pounds, according to the catalog.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
