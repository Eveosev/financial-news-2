The pound declined to a 2 1/2-year
low versus the dollar and dropped against the euro this week
amid investor concern that U.K. policy makers are struggling to
avoid an unprecedented triple-dip recession.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  rejected suggestions that
cutting taxes or increasing spending would help the economy and
called on the Bank of England to aid growth. The central bank
left its program of asset purchases designed to boost the
economy unchanged on March 7 amid speculation its remit may be
changed to allow more monetary easing. Gilts had their biggest
weekly drop since the start of the year.  “I’m struggling to find any sort of scenario which would
be sterling positive at this stage,” said  Ian Stannard , London-
based head of European foreign-exchange strategy at Morgan
Stanley. Cameron’s comments “very much go along the lines that
the government is looking to monetary policy to offset the
negative impact of further fiscal consolidation. We’d expect
sterling to remain under pressure.”  The pound declined 0.7 percent in the week to $1.4928 at
4:45 p.m.  London  time yesterday when it slid to $1.4885, the
weakest level since July 1, 2010. Sterling slipped 0.5 percent
to 87.05 pence per euro.  The U.K. currency will weaken toward $1.46 within the next
few weeks, Stannard said.  Asset Purchases  The pound has dropped 6 percent this year, the second-worst
performer after the yen among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  said on March 7 that it sold the U.K.
currency after the Bank of England left its asset-purchase
program at 375 billion pounds because the company questions
Britain’s leaders’ ability to stimulate growth.  The pound has had its worst start to the year since 1992
against the dollar as investors bet the central bank will boost
stimulus while also debasing the currency as the U.K. risks an
unprecedented triple-dip recession.  U.K. government bonds fell for the first week in three
after the central bank’s decision and as a report showed
Britons’ expectations for inflation in the coming year rose
slightly. Consumers questioned last month anticipated prices
would increase 3.6 percent over the following year. Inflation
was at 2.7 percent in January, in breach of the  Bank of
England ’s 2 percent limit.  The 10-year gilt yield rose 19 basis points, or 0.19
percentage point, to 2.06 percent. The 1.75 percent security due
September 2022 slid 1.63, or 16.30 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 97.32. The rate on two-year securities gained four
basis points to 0.26 percent.  U.K. government bonds lost 1.4 percent this year through
March 7, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds and Treasuries both dropped 0.8 percent.  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research
publishes its estimate for February gross domestic product on
March 12. It cut its 2013 growth forecasts on Feb. 5 to 0.7
percent after a 1.1 percent prediction in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
