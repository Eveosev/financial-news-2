The cost of  New York Giants ’ tickets
at Metlife Stadium will remain the same for the fourth
consecutive season, the National Football League team told
season ticketholders.  Parking was raised $5 to $30 per game at the stadium, the
team said yesterday in an e-mail to fans.  Season-ticket holders were told that the team has started
preparations for the 2013 season “with the objective of
returning to the playoffs.” The Giants, who were 9-7 and missed
the playoffs last season, won the 2008 and 2012 Super Bowls.  The Giants will host Dallas, Washington, Philadelphia,
Green Bay, Minnesota, Seattle, Denver and Oakland this season.  “Thank you once again for your enthusiastic and loyal
support of the  New York  Football Giants,” the team said in the
e-mail. “We look forward to seeing you at MetLife Stadium in
2013.”  The Giants hosted the first NFL regular-season game held at
Metlife Stadium against the Carolina Panthers, winning 31-18 on
Sept. 12, 2010. The Giants share the stadium with the  New York
Jets .  To contact the reporter on this story:
