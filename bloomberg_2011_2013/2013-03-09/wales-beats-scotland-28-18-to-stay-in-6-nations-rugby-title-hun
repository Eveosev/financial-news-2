Wales  beat Scotland 28-18 to stay in
the title chase in rugby’s Six Nations Championship.  Leigh Halfpenny kicked seven penalties and finished with 23
points for Wales and Richard Hibbard scored the game’s only try
at Murrayfield stadium in Edinburgh. Greig Laidlaw booted six
penalties for the Scotland points.  Wales pulls even with  England , which hosts Italy tomorrow,
at the top of the standings with six points. The teams will meet
in the final round of matches next week in Cardiff with the
title at stake.  France earned its first point by rallying for a 13-13 draw
with Ireland in Dublin. Louis Picamole scored a try in the 74th
minute, which Frederick Michalak converted, to end last-place
France’s run of three straight losses.  Jamie Heaslip  touched
down for Ireland, which remains fourth with three points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
