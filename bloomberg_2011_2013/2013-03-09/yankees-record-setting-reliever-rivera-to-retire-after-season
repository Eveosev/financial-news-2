Mariano Rivera announced he is
closing a career in which he’s helped the New York Yankees win
five World Series titles and produced a Major League Baseball
saves record that some historians say will stand forever.  Rivera, at 43 baseball’s oldest active big-league player,
said at a televised news conference in Tampa, Florida, today
that this season will be the last of a 19-year run, which began
in 1995 as a starting pitcher.  “It’s not too easy when you come to a decision like
this,” Rivera said. “I’m retiring from the game I love and
have passion for and enjoyed for so many years.”  The right-hander who jogs into games to Metallica’s “Enter
Sandman” will exit with the legacy as possibly the most
effective relief pitcher in baseball history. He has a record
 608 regular-season saves  -- more than twice as many as  any other
active player  -- and 42 more during the postseason, where he’s
compiled an 8-1 record with a 0.70 earned run average in 96
games.  Since 1997, Rivera has been the Yankees’ closer, the man
out of the bullpen who gets the ball to record the final outs of
victory. A 12-time All-Star, he was limited to nine games last
season after tearing a knee ligament in May while chasing
batting-practice fly balls in center field at Kansas City, a
pre-game pattern he has followed for years and one which he says
he has no intention of dropping.  Empty Tank  Rivera hinted during spring training a year ago that the
2012 season might be his last, then vowed to return after the
injury. He signed a one-year, $10 million contract with the
Yankees in December.  “Now is the time,” he said. “I’ve given everything and
the tank is almost empty. The gas that I have left is for this
year.”  The son of a Panamanian fisherman, Rivera was signed by the
Yankees as an undrafted free agent for $3,000 in 1990. He wasn’t
regarded as a top prospect, and was left unprotected by the
Yankees when the Colorado Rockies and  Florida  Marlins stocked
their expansion-team rosters in 1993.  He broke into the majors as a starter with Yankees in 1995
before being moved to the bullpen as a set-up man for then-
closer John Wetteland. Rivera finished third in the American
League Cy Young Award voting as a reliever in 1996 in helping
the Yankees win the World Series for the first time in 17 years.  Rivera’s success is built on a cut fastball that can break
bats, a pitch he’s called a gift from God and one discovered
while playing catch with teammate Ramiro Mendoza in 1997. Jim Thome, who hit 612 home runs in 22 years in the majors, calls
the pitch “the best ever in the history of the game.”  Rivera has averaged 40 saves since 1997 and is one of two
pitchers, along with Eric Gagne, with two 50-save seasons.  Saves Leader  In 2011, he surpassed Trevor Hoffman as baseball’s all-time
saves leader when he recorded the 602nd of his career. Peter Golenbock, who has written more than a dozen books on baseball,
said then that Rivera probably would hold “until the end of
time.”  Rivera has been even more effective during the postseason,
when he helped the Yankees win World Series titles in 1996,
1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. He recorded the final out in each of
the three consecutive series clinchers.  “He basically made my career,” Joe Torre, the Yankees’
manager from 1996 to 2007, said two days ago as reported in the
New York Times.  Rivera’s saves in the playoffs and World Series are nine
more than the combined total of Brad Lidge and Dennis Eckersley,
who rank second and third on the list. Rivera also had 14
postseason saves of six outs or more, double the expected job
of the modern closer.  Infrequent Failures  Rivera’s failures were infrequent, yet memorable. He
couldn’t close out the 1997 American League Division Series
against  Cleveland , allowing an eighth-inning Game 4 home run to
Sandy Alomar Jr. He blew a 2-1 lead in the ninth inning of Game
7 of the 2001 World Series against  Arizona , and had three blown
saves in the 2004 playoffs, including two against  Boston .  A religious person who has said he’ll become a preacher
once his baseball days are done, Rivera has avoided the scandals
and tabloid headlines that frequently accompany sports stardom
in New York.  “I don’t get nervous,” he was quoted as saying in a 2006
article in USA Today. “I trust God.”  He has dealt with personal tragedy, such as in October 2004
when he rushed to  Panama  during the playoffs after two relatives
died in a swimming pool accident at his home. After a six-hour,
2,200-mile flight back to New York, he saved Game 1 of the AL
Championship Series against the Boston Red Sox.  The torn knee ligament was the first significant injury of
Rivera’s career and he’s shown few signs of decline as he’s
gotten older. Since 2008, Rivera has had a 1.72 ERA in 264
games. He had 44 saves and a 1.91 ERA during his last full
season in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
