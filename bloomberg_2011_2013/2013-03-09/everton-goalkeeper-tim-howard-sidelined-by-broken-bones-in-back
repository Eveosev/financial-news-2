Everton goalkeeper  Tim Howard  is out
indefinitely with two broken bones in his back, manager  David
Moyes  said on the soccer club’s website.  The U.S. national team member has sat out two games since
being injured in Everton’s F.A. Cup match against Oldham on Feb.
26. Moyes said the bones are not weight-bearing and just need
time to heal.  “If everything goes well, he misses next week’s game and
then because of the international break he might be close after
the rest because that will be four weeks,” Moyes said.  Howard, 34, will likely miss the U.S.’s World Cup
qualifiers against Costa Rica and Mexico later this month. The
Americans lost their opening match of the final round of
qualifying in the North and Central American and Caribbean
region. The top three in the six-team group qualify for the 2014
 World Cup  in Brazil with the fourth-place team entering a
playoff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
