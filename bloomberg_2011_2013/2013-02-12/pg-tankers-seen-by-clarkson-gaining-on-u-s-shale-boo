Tankers hauling liquefied petroleum
gas will gain as shale oil and gas production boosts U.S.
exports and fleet growth slows, according to Clarkson Capital
Markets, a unit of the worldâ€™s largest shipbroker.  Global demand will rise 5 percent a year through 2016 while
the fully refrigerated fleet expands 4.5 percent annually in the
next two years, with few ships ordered afterward,  Urs Dur , a New
York-based analyst at Clarkson, said in an e-mailed report
today. U.S. export capacity will rise to 12 million metric tons
in 2015 from 5 million tons now, requiring more vessels, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
