Lloyds Banking Group Plc  sold $14.9
million of 15-year callable step-up notes, its largest
structured note offering since April.  The notes, issued Feb. 5, yield 3 percent for the first
five years, 3.98 percent through the 10th year, and 4.73 percent
after that until maturity, according to a  prospectus  filed with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Bank of America
Corp.  distributed the securities for a 1.75 percent fee.  On April 24, Lloyds sold $15 million of 15-year callable
notes tied to the six-month London interbank offered rate and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The securities yield 7.5
percent annually as long as Libor is from zero to 6 percent and
the equity benchmark doesn’t fall below 900, according to a
prospectus filed with the SEC. Libor is a rate at which banks
say they can borrow in dollars from each other.  Lloyds sold $100 million of structured notes in the U.S.
last year, Bloomberg data show. Nicole Sharp, a spokeswoman for
the London-based bank, declined to comment.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
