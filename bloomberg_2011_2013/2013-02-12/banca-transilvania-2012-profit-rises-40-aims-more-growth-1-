Banca Transilvania SA , Romania’s
second-biggest publicly traded bank, said its profit rose 40
percent last year on higher lending and proposed to retain
profit to finance further growth.  Net income jumped to 320.4 million lei ($98 million) from
228.6 million lei in 2011, the Cluj-Napoca, Romania-based bank
said  in a regulatory filing  today. Operating profit rose 9
percent to 720.2 million lei on rising revenue from financial
operations and fees.  “An increase in the number of clients, together with a
record number of operations and a good performance in some of
our business lines have led to a strong consolidation of our
market position,” Chairman  Horia Ciorcila  said in the
statement. “We will propose to our shareholders to agree on the
profit capitalization so that the bank can grow further and
support the Romanian economy.”  Banca Transilvania, one of the six Romanian banks
controlled by domestic investors, boosted lending at a time when
the country’s banking system is struggling with rising bad
loans. The industry posted the third consecutive year of losses
and incurred a total loss of 2.1 billion lei in 2012 as the
ratio of non-performing loans soared to 18.2 percent,  Ziarul
Financiar  reported today.  Bad Loans  Banca Transilvania’s net assets grew 15 percent to 29.6
billion lei from 25.8 billion lei at the end of 2011, the lender
said. Non-performing loans amounted to 11.3 percent of the
bank’s total loan portfolio, according to the statement.  Net bad-loan provisions rose to 379.4 million lei last
year, compared with 380.8 million lei a year earlier, the bank
said.  “Increasing the bank’s value and its market share remain a
priority in 2013,” Ciorcila said.  Romania’s banking industry is dominated by Austrian banks,
which control 38 percent of the market, followed by Romanian
lenders with a market share of 18.3 percent, according to the
central bank’s data.  Banca Comerciala Romana SA , owned by  Erste
Group Bank AG , is the country’s largest bank by assets.  BRD-
Groupe Societe Generale SA  ranks second.  To contact the reporters on this story:
