Two men were charged in the fatal
shooting of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, a Chicago student who
attended President  Barack Obama ’s inauguration in Washington
last month.  Kenneth Williams, 20, and Micheal Ward, 18, were charged
with first-degree murder in connection with the shooting,
Chicago Police said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Both men
were scheduled to appear in court today for a bond hearing,
police said.  Pendleton was shot Jan. 29 one mile from President  Barack Obama ’s South Side home. She died after taking shelter from the
rain with other students near King College Prep High School,
where she was a band majorette and played volleyball. She was
shot in the back, and a 16-year-old boy was wounded by a gunman
who sped away in a car, police said.  The mid-afternoon shooting occurred beneath a metal canopy
in a small park with brightly painted playground equipment. The
violence belied the tidy order of a street with restored
brownstones and newly constructed brick townhouses.  A police spokesman said yesterday the names of lawyers
representing Williams and Ward weren’t immediately available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
