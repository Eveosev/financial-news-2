Japanese shares led Asian  stocks 
higher after a contender for Bank of Japan governor said extra
monetary easing can be justified this year. South Korea’s Kospi
Index reversed gains as North Korea conducted a nuclear test.  Canon Inc. , Japan’s largest camera maker that gets 80
percent of sales abroad, gained 2.2 percent as the yen touched
the lowest level since May 2010.  Dentsu Inc.  soared 10 percent
as nine-month operating profit climbed 24 percent. Nissan Motor
Co. sank 3.8 percent after Japan’s second-biggest carmaker
reported third-quarter profit that fell short of analyst
estimates, with sales dropping in China.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 0.1 percent to 132.57 at
8:28 p.m in Tokyo, snapping three days of losses as three shares
advanced for every two that fell. Equity markets in Japan and
South Korea reopened today after yesterday’s holiday, while
markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam and
Malaysia remain shut.  “Candidates for the governor of the Bank of Japan have
been making some very sympathetic remarks,”  Stephen Wood , New-
York based market strategist who helps manage about $163 billion
at Russell Investments, said in a Bloomberg Television interview
with Susan Li. “Right now you’ve got the initial stages of
policy relief in Japan. Clearly what they’re looking at will be
better for equity markets than we’ve seen for a while. It might
be early days there.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 1.9 percent, while
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
Index reversed gains, falling 0.3 percent, as the country’s
national security adviser Chun Yung Woo said North Korea carried
out a nuclear test at 11:57 a.m. local time today.  BOJ Stimulus  Japanese exporters and banks advanced. Canon climbed 2.2
percent to 3,305 yen and Toyota Motor Corp. gained 0.5 percent
to 4,920 yen. Mizuho Financial Group Inc. added 4.8 percent to
217 yen and  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s
second-largest bank by market value, rose 3.5 percent to 3,875
yen.  The BOJ could usher in a growth spurt unseen in a
generation by stepping up stimulus and ending deflation,
according to Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the Asian Development
Bank. Kuroda, who said he was “satisfied” with his current job
amid Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s preparations for unveiling a
nominee to succeed Masaaki Shirakawa, said that additional BOJ
stimulus could be justified for 2013. Kuroda has been cited by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG as the top
candidate for BOJ governor.  Asset Purchases  The BOJ last month said it would start open-ended asset
purchases only in January 2014, and the board is forecast to
keep its policy unchanged at a Feb. 13-14 gathering, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. The yen weakened to as
much as 94.46 per dollar yesterday, its lowest level since May
2010.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less
than 0.1 percent today. The S&P 500 dropped 0.1 percent
yesterday after a six-week rally left the gauge trading at its
most expensive valuation since July 2011.  The S&P 500 has rallied 6.4 percent in 2013 to its highest
level since November 2007 as U.S. lawmakers reached a budget
compromise and companies reported better-than-estimated
earnings. That’s more than double the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s
gain of 2.4 percent this year through yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.7 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.7 for the S&P 500 and a multiple of 12.2 for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Company Earnings  Of the 288 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific index that
have reported  earnings  so far this quarter and for which
Bloomberg has estimates, 53 percent have exceeded profit
expectations. Some 53 percent have missed sales projections.
That compares with 74 percent of S&P 500 companies that topped
profit forecasts during the period, while 33 percent fell short
of sales estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Among companies having reported results, Dentsu gained 10
percent to 2,838 yen, the highest closing price since January
2008. Nissan slid 3.8 percent to 950 yen.  Whitehaven Coal Ltd., Australia’s second-biggest
independent coal producer, rose 7.8 percent to A$3.19, the
largest advance in two months, after gaining conditional
approval to build a A$766 million ($789 million) mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
