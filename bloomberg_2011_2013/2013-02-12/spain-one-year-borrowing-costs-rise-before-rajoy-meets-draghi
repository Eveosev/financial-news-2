Spain’s one-year borrowing costs
rose in an auction today ahead of a meeting between Premier
 Mariano Rajoy  and European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi .  Spain sold 5.57 billion euros ($7.46 billion) of six- and
12-months securities, exceeding the Treasury’s upper goal of 5.5
billion euros. It sold six-month bills at an average 0.859
percent, down from 0.888 percent on Jan. 22. The 12-month
securities yielded 1.548 percent, up from 1.472 percent on Jan.
15.  Demand for the six-month bills was 2.88 times the amount
sold, compared with 3.85 last month, and the ratio was 1.97
compared with 2.21 on the longer-dated securities, the Madrid-
based Bank of Spain said.  Spain’s borrowing costs rose last week for the first time
since November. On Feb. 7, when the country last auctioned notes
and bills, the yield on the  10-year benchmark bond  jumped to
5.52 percent, the highest level since Jan. 11, when it dropped
below 5 percent for the first time since March 2012.  Spain’s 2012  budget deficit  will show unprecedented efforts
of fiscal consolidation, Rajoy said earlier today during a news
conference. Deficit data, which Rajoy says will be published in
the coming weeks, will show how much he reduced the second-
largest shortfall in the euro region after a year in office.  Spanish 10-year bond yields were unchanged at 5.35 percent
after the auction at 10:55 a.m. in Madrid. That compares with a
euro-era high of 7.75 percent in July, before Draghi pledged to
safeguard the euro. Draghi will address lawmakers during a
closed-door meeting at 2 p.m. in Madrid and hold a press
conference at 3:30 p.m., before joining Rajoy at the Moncloa
palace for bilateral talks.  The Treasury, which said on Feb. 7 it had sold 23 billion
euros of notes and bonds, or 19 percent of its gross medium- and
long-term issuance target for 2013, returns to the markets next
week to sell three- and nine-month bills, and will issue bonds
on Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
