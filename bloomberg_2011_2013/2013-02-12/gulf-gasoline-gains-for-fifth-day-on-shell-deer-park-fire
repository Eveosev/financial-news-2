U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline rose for a
fifth day after fire broke out at a Royal Dutch Shell Plc
refinery in Texas.  The 340,000-barrel-a-day  Deer Park  plant had a fire at
about 9:30 a.m. local time, said  Kimberly Windon , a company
spokeswoman in Houston. The fire “was quickly isolated and
contained to one unit,” and there were no injuries, she said.  Conventional,  87-octane  gasoline on the U.S. Gulf Coast
strengthened 1.88 cents to a discount of 12.75 cents versus
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4 p.m., the
narrowest gap since Jan. 8, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
 Reformulated , 84-octane gasoline rose 0.88 cent to 9.75 cents
below futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region strengthened 0.5 cent
to trade at a premium of 5.5 cents above heating oil futures.  The 3-2-1 crack spread, or a measure of refining
profitability for  gasoline and distillates  based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, gained 51.61 cents to $29.93
a barrel. The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil advanced
$1.92 to $9.43 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
