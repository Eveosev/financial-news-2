U.K. antitrust regulators began
studying Bats Chi-X Europe’s plans to register as an exchange
and invited rivals and customers to comment.  Bats Chi-X wants to be the first European alternative
trading system to become a recognized investment exchange, or
RIE, in a renewed challenge to traditional venues such as
Deutsche Boerse AG, NYSE Euronext and London Stock Exchange
Group Plc. The Office of Fair Trading will decide whether the
switch would hurt competition, according to a  statement  on the
regulator’s website today.  “A review of our RIE submission by the OFT is part of the
standard application process,”  Mark Hemsley , chief executive
officer of Bats Chi-X Europe, said in an e-mailed statement.
“We look forward to working closely with the OFT to complete
the assessment.”  The London-based company, currently deemed a Multilateral
Trading Facility, is seeking the license to attract business
from retail investors and fund managers who may be legally
restricted to trading on an exchange. It would also mean firms
could choose to list their shares on Bats Chi-X Europe.  The move would make Bats Chi-X Europe the third exchange in
the U.K., after LSE, Europe’s oldest independent bourse, and
ICAP Plc’s  Securities & Derivatives Exchange . Bats Europe is one
of a wave of alternative trading systems that opened after
European Union regulations introduced in 2007 opened the door to
competition with incumbent bourses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
