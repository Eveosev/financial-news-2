Kazakhstanâ€™s industrial  production 
grew slower than economists forecast in January as steel and
copper output slumped.  Output at factories, mines and utilities rose 0.7 percent
from a year earlier, down from 2 percent in December and 0.9
percent in November, the Astana-based state statistics agency
said today on its website. That missed the 1.7 percent median
forecast of of six economists in a Bloomberg  survey .  Rolled-steel output shrank 55 percent to about 100,000
metric tons, the agency said. Copper production dropped 3
percent to 29,100 tons and ferroalloys fell 2.8 percent to about
100,000 tons, the agency said.  Oil and gas condensate production advanced 1.5 percent to 7
million tons, while natural gas grew 1.7 percent to 3.6 billion
cubic meters, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
