Modern Water Plc , a British water-
treatment company, said 10 million pounds ($15.6 million) was
raised in a share placement, proceeds of which will help fund
its forward-osmosis business in China and the Middle East.  The funds will enable the company to invest abroad, with a
particular focus on China, Neil McDougall, executive chairman of
Guildford-based Modern Water, said in today’s statement. “We
intend to invest in further improvements in membrane efficiency
for the membrane-processes division and to expand the monitoring
division through acquisitions.”  The company has helped  produce water  in Gibraltar and at a
pilot plant in Oman. It commissioned the Al Najdah facility
there last year that’s the world’s first forward-osmosis plant,
a process it champions as less energy-intensive than reverse-
osmosis desalination applications that make salt water potable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
