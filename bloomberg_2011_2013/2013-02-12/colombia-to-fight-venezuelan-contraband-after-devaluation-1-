The Colombian government is studying
how to curb the smuggling of subsidized or price-controlled
goods from Venezuela after its neighbor devalued its currency,
Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said today.  “We can’t allow that, due to the devaluation in Venezuela,
the Colombian market is inundated with contraband, putting at
risk very important sectors in our economy,” Cardenas said in
an interview on Caracol Radio.  President Hugo Chavez’s government said last week it will
devalue the bolivar 32 percent to 6.3 bolivars per dollar
starting Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
