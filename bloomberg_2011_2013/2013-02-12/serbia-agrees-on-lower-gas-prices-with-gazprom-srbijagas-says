Serbia expects to cut the cost of
gas imports by almost 10 percent this year after its natural gas
monopoly signs a new contract for gas supplies from Russia next
month.  Srbijagas  and  Gazprom OAO  agreed on the gas price in Moscow
last week and the agreement needs the Serbian government’s
approval, the Novi Sad, Serbia-based company said in e-mailed
answers to Bloomberg questions.  “On average, the price is expected to range between $380
and $390 per 1,000 cubic meters,” according to the agreement
that envisages quarterly price adjustments, the company said.  Serbia, fully reliant on Russia for gas imports, was paying
$421 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas on average in 2012,  Dusan Bajatovic , Srbijagas’ general manager who negotiated with
Gazprom, told the Belgrade newspaper Blic on Jan. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
