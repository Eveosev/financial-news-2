Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA ,
Spain’s second-biggest bank, expects to increase its share of
the domestic market to 20 percent from 12.5 percent, Chairman
 Francisco Gonzalez  said.  “The crisis is for us an enormous opportunity to have a
much bigger brand,” Gonzalez said in a seminar in Madrid today.
“I believe in the years to come that BBVA will have at least 20
percent of this market, so it’s very important.”  Government orders for banks to clean up soured real estate
assets that piled up on their books during Spain’s property
crash has pressured some to merge or seek state aid. The process
has favored larger lenders such as BBVA and  Banco Santander SA ,
Spain’s biggest bank, that can rely on revenue from businesses
outside Spain to absorb the costs of the clean-up and an
economic recession at home.  The U.S. will be the market of greatest growth for BBVA in
the next five years, Gonzalez said. BBVA paid $9 billion for
Compass Bancshares Inc. in 2007 to extend its business in the
southern U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
