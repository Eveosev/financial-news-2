The  Public Utilities Commission of
the City & County of San Francisco  sold about $332 million of
bonds backed by wastewater revenue in the biggest municipal
offer scheduled for this week.  The issue was the first in California’s fourth most-
populous municipality after Moody’s Investors Service this month
raised the rating of the city and county’s general obligations
to the second-highest level.  Rates ranged from 2.01 percent on securities maturing in
October 2023 to 3.6 percent on 2042 bonds, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  San Francisco’s commission plans to sell $4.8 billion of
revenue bonds over 10 years for sewer improvements, Todd
Rydstrom, the chief financial officer, said in an interview
before the sale. Proceeds from today’s issue will go toward a $2
billion replacement of a treatment facility.  The competitive deal was the first borrowing backed by
wastewater revenue since 2010 that wasn’t aimed at retiring
debt, Rydstrom said.  Moody’s on Feb. 5 increased the general-obligation bond
rating of San Francisco to Aa1 because of the “notable
strengths” of its tax base and economy. Its jobless rate was
6.7 percent in November, below the state average of 9.6 percent,
Standard & Poor’s said.  S&P rates the commission’s debt AA-, fourth-highest, saying
it has a “demonstrated ability and willingness” to adjust
rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
