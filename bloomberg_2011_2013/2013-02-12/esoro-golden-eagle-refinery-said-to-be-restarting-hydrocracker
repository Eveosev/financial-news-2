Tesoro Corp. ’s Golden Eagle refinery
in Northern California is restarting the hydrocracker that was
shut more than a week ago because of a leak, a person with
direct knowledge of the repairs said.  The work, initially expected to take three weeks, was
finished ahead of schedule using equipment that the  refinery  had
at hand, said two people, who asked not to be identified because
the information isn’t public. The hydrocracker should be
producing at full rates within two days, one of them said.  Golden Eagle can process 170,000 barrels of feedstock a
day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The plant refines crude
oils from Alaska, California and foreign sources, according to
Tesoro’s website.  The hydrocracker, which converts heavy hydrocarbons into
lighter fuels such as high-octane gasoline and fuel oil, was
shut Feb. 2 after a hole was found in a line, a person with
knowledge of the outage said Feb. 4.  Tina Barbee , a spokeswoman at Tesoro’s headquarters in San
Antonio, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for
comment on the unit’s startup. She said by e-mail earlier today
that the plant was performing planned work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
