Iran reiterated its readiness to
allow nuclear inspectors to visit the Parchin military site if
the Persian Gulf nation’s right to enrich uranium is
acknowledged by world powers.  “We are prepared to come to a comprehensive agreement”
with the International Atomic Energy Agency in which Iran’s
rights as a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
would be “fully endorsed and recognized,” Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast  told reporters today.  The deal “would include the removal of concerns, and the
visit of the Parchin military site could be one of these
agreements,” Mehmanparast said in Tehran today.  Mehmanparast’s comments, broadcast on state television,
come before a visit tomorrow by an IAEA team seeking broader
access to suspected nuclear facilities. The two sides met in
Tehran in January, when Iranian officials didn’t allow the UN
atomic watchdog to visit Parchin.  The IAEA says it has received intelligence that Iran
carried out nuclear work at Parchin. Iranian officials say the
evidence given to the agency by unidentified countries isn’t
genuine, and point out that they haven’t been given access to
the documents.  The U.S. and its allies say Iran may seek to make a nuclear
bomb, while Iran says its program is solely civilian and needed
to secure energy. IAEA officials routinely inspect Iran’s
declared nuclear facilities, including enrichment plants at
Natanz and Fordo, though treaty arrangements don’t compel the
country to open up peripheral facilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
