Rexel SA  will refinance its debt to
exploit low borrowing costs as the world’s biggest listed
distributor of electrical equipment predicts stagnating
profitability this year amid Europe’s economic woes.  The Paris-based company will save as much as 20 million
euros ($27 million) in 2014 versus this year as it calls a 8.25
percent bond maturing in 2016 and replaces it with a bond with a
coupon of less than 5 percent and a longer maturity, Chief
Financial Officer  Michel Favre  said at a conference today.
Calling the bond will lead to a small charge this year and then
have a “very good” positive impact in 2014, he said.  The price of Rexel’s 2016 bond rose 0.8 percent to 109.3 as
of 12:51 p.m. in Paris today. Rexel also said that from the end
of this year, 82 percent of its debt will mature in more than
four years, up from 45 percent at the end of 2012, as it also
refinances other borrowings  Rexel , which sells electrical products such as installation
equipment, lighting and cables, is cutting costs as economic
“uncertainties” in Europe are heightened by elections in
Germany and Italy and political turmoil in Spain, Chief
Executive Officer  Rudy Provoost  said. For 2013, the French
company predicts little change in profitability and a ‘slight’
increase in organic sales, helped by rising construction in
North America and emerging markets.  Rexel also proposed paying a dividend of 75 cents per
share, up 15 percent from last year. That represents a pay-out
ratio of 53 percent of the group’s “recurring” net income,
according to the company.  Higher Dividend   Rexel  shares  rose as much as 6.6 percent to 16.33 euros,
and were up 3.9 percent at 15.78 euros as of 1:06 p.m. in Paris,
giving the company a market value of 4.3 billion euros.  Rexel confirmed its dividend policy of paying at least 40
percent of its recurring net income. The company can increase
its payout because it will be “a bit more modest on
acquisitions” this year than in 2012, when it spent 620 million
euros, the CEO said.  The company forecasts its  margin  for adjusted earnings
before interest, taxes and amortization will represent 5.7
percent of revenue this year, unchanged from last year.  Rexel’s net-debt-to-Ebitda ratio remains below 3, the CEO
said.  The Ebita margin should exceed 6.5 percent of sales in 2015
as Rexel raises prices and sells more valuable products, and at
the same time reduces costs and working capital requirements,
Rexel reiterated today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
