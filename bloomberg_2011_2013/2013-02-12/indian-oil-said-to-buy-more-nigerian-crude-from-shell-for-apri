Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s
largest refiner, bought one cargo of Nigeria’s Bonny Light and
another of Brass River from Royal Dutch Shell Plc for April
loading, said two traders, who asked not to be identified
because the information is confidential.  The refiner has purchased four consignments of about 1
million barrels each from Shell via tender this month. It bought
one lot each of Bonny Light and Qua Iboe, according to three
traders on Feb. 8.  The company issued a second tender on Feb. 8 for April
loading crude which is set to be awarded on Feb. 15, according
to a document obtained by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
