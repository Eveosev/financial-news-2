Colombia can’t do much more than
“give signals” on the exchange rate, Finance Minister Mauricio
Cardenas said today.  “The equilibrium exchange rate isn’t the one we have
today, of 1,780 per dollar, but rather 1,950 per dollar, and
that’s where we want to steer the exchange rate,” Cardenas told
students in Bucaramanga. “We can’t do much more than give these
signals, but we believe that the market will respond.”  Cardenas said dollar purchases by the central bank and the
treasury, the saving of royalties abroad, and state-controlled
oil company Ecopetrol SA issuing debt in pesos rather than
dollars, are all signals the government is sending to the
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
