Kenya Power Ltd. , the East African
nation’s sole electricity distributor, climbed to the highest in
more than 19 months after it was recommended at long-term buy by
Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd.  The stock advanced 1.6 percent to 19 shillings by the close
in Nairobi, the highest since June 30, 2011. More than two
million shares, almost triple the three-month daily average,
changed hands as the stock rallied for an eighth day.  Kenya Power  was given a target price of 22 shillings,
Kestrel said in an e-mailed note to clients yesterday, citing
“vast opportunities” in the country’s power industry, where
the penetration rate stands at 30 percent, compared with 99
percent for North Africa.  The utility company is also one of the 2013 stock picks for
Nairobi-based Old Mutual Securities Ltd. The stock has climbed
11 percent this year.  Kenya Power is attractive because of the “vast opportunity
in the power sector as a result of low penetration rate” and
increased revenue from its rural electrification program,  Old
Mutual  said Jan 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
