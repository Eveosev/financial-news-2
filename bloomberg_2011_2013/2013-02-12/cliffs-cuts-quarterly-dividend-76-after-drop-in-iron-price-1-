Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. , the
biggest U.S. iron ore producer, fell the most in more than three
years after cutting its quarterly dividend by 76 percent and
announcing a share sale to repay debt.  The shares slid 18 percent lower to $29.87 at 10:16 a.m. in
New York. Earlier the declined as much as 19 percent, the most
intraday since May 2009.  Cliffs reduced the payout to 15 cents a share, the
Cleveland-based company said in a statement after the close of
trading yesterday. That erases the increase made in March, when
Cliffs raised the dividend to 62.5 cents from 28 cents and said
the company would shift its strategic focus from mergers and
acquisitions to organic growth while returning capital to
shareholders. Since then, iron ore prices plunged and the
company reported delays at a Canadian mine project.  “Though the dividend cut was a prudent one in terms of
cash management, the move to lower it after making a large
increase in 2Q12 and defending it on recent conference calls is
likely to generate much shareholder angst,”  Anthony Rizzuto , an
analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. in New York, said in a note today.  Cliffs plans to sell as many as 10.4 million common shares,
valued at $378.9 million at yesterday’s closing price, it said
yesterday in a separate statement. It also intends to sell
depositary shares that represent about 575,000 convertible
preferred shares. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BofA Merill Lynch are
managing the sale.  ‘Risk Mitigation’  Cliffs also said it won agreements from lenders to suspend
the limit of its ratio of debt to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization this year and temporarily
use covenants based on total capitalization and minimum tangible
net worth instead.  “You’ve got to think about this balance sheet work we’re
doing right now as risk mitigation, not future forecasting of
iron ore pricing,” Chairman and Chief Executive  Joseph Carrabba 
said today on a conference call.  Iron ore for delivery at the Chinese port of Tianjin, a
global benchmark, fell 14 percent to average $120.58 a ton in
the fourth quarter, after touching a three-year low of $86.70 in
September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from Steel
Business Briefing.  Cliffs reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.62 billion, or
$11.36 a share, compared with net income of $185.4 million, or
$1.30, a year earlier. Earnings excluding a $1 billion writedown
of assets and other one-time items were 62 cents a share,
beating the 51-cent average of 20 analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Sales fell 4.2 percent to $1.54 billion, trailing the $1.53
billion average of 14 estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
