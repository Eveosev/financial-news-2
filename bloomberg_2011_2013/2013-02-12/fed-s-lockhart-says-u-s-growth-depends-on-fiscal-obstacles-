President  Dennis Lockhart  said the near-term outlook for the
U.S. economy will depend on the resolution of fiscal challenges.  “Growth prospects will depend on the removal of short-term
obstacles to growth,” Lockhart said today in the text of
remarks given in Madrid. “Chief among these is finding workable
solutions to immediate fiscal problems and to the uncertainty
these challenges generate.”  Lockhart said the U.S. economy will grow at a rate of
between 2 percent and 2.5 percent this year.  “I could be wrong, but I don’t expect 2013 to be a break-
out year,” Lockhart said. “I hope I’m pleasantly surprised
about upside prospects for the U.S. economy.”  Lockhart, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year,
said he sees some “hopeful signs” in recent economic data,
including in the housing, hydrocarbon energy and auto
manufacturing industries. He also pointed to “quite buoyant”
U.S. equity markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
