DuPont Co. , the largest U.S.
chemical maker by market value, sold $2 billion of bonds in its
first offering in almost two years.  The company issued $1.25 billion of 2.8 percent, 10-year
notes yielding 82 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $750 million of 4.15 percent, 30-year bonds with
a relative yield of 97 basis points, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The bonds are rated A2 by Moodyâ€™s Investors
Service, the data show.  DuPont last sold debt in March 2011, issuing $2 billion in
four parts, including $500 million of 4.25 percent, 10-year
debentures with a 95 basis-point spread to benchmarks, Bloomberg
data show. The bonds traded at 113.9 cents on the dollar to
yield 2.37 percent on Feb. 6, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley managed the offering for the Wilmington, Delaware-based
company, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
