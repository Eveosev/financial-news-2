Barclays Plc , under pressure to trim
its securities unit, paid its investment bankers an average
bonus of about 54,100 pounds ($84,439), more than double the
annual pay of British employees.  Bonuses fell 17 percent in 2012 from 65,085 pounds for each
employee a year earlier, the London-based company said in its
full-year earnings statement today. Average pay for U.K. full-
time employees is 26,500 pounds, according to the  Office for
National Statistics .  Investment banking will remain a “sizable part” of
Britain’s second-largest bank by assets, Chief Executive Officer
 Antony Jenkins , 51, told Bloomberg Television’s  Francine Lacqua 
in an interview today. During a six-month strategic review the
lender didn’t seek “a specific proportion for one business or
the other,” he said.  Barclays announced plans today to cut 1,800 positions at
the investment bank as part of changes that included closing its
structured capital markets tax planning unit. The bank has been
under scrutiny from legislators since it was fined 290 million
pounds in June for attempting to manipulate the London interbank
offered rate and other benchmark interest rates, with some of
the lender’s top executives, including former CEO  Robert Diamond , departing.  The investment bank’s bonus pool fell 15 percent to about
1.3 billion pounds for its 24,000 employees, based in cities
including London and New York, Barclays said.  Top Performers  “The awards at investment banks are heavily skewed toward
the top performers and the range for bonuses is usually vast,”
said  John Purcell , CEO of Purcell & Co., a London executive-
search firm. “There are some bankers who will be receiving
seven-figure bonuses.”  Barclays will defer all 2012 awards for the bank’s 1,200
managing directors at the investment bank and pay bonuses of as
much as 65,000 pounds in cash for more junior staff, a person
with knowledge of the plans said earlier this month. Managing
directors’ bonuses for 2012 will all be deferred and paid in
one-third installments from 2014 to 2016, half in cash and half
in shares, said the person, who asked not to be identified as
the plans aren’t yet public.  For more junior staff, awards greater than 65,000 pounds
and less than 250,000 pounds will see 35 percent of the total
deferred and paid half in cash and half in stock. Any bonus of
more than 250,000 pounds will be deferred, with half being paid
in cash and the rest in stock, the person said.  Revenue at the investment bank rose 13 percent to 11.72
billion pounds in 2012, driven by its fixed-income, currency and
commodities business, equities and prime services, the company
said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
