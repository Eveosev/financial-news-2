U.S. stocks  advanced, sending
benchmark indexes to five-year highs, as earnings topped
estimates and investors awaited President Barack Obama’s State
of the Union address.  Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. rallied 10 percent after raising
its forecast in anticipation of a jump in same-store sales. Avon
Products Inc. jumped 22 percent on better-than-expected profit
and a plan to consider options for its Silpada jewelry unit.
Coca-Cola Co. slipped 2.7 percent as global volume sales missed
analysts’ estimates. Facebook Inc. sank 1.9 percent as Sanford
C. Bernstein & Co. cut its recommendation.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2 percent to
1,520.27 at 2:30 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average increased 57.19 points, or 0.4 percent, to 14,028.43.
Both gauges are poised for the highest close since 2007. Trading
in S&P 500 companies was 5.9 percent below the 30-day average at
this time of day.  “This market is front-running better economic and earnings
news,”  John Augustine , who helps manage $27 billion as chief
market strategist at Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp, said
in a phone interview. “We all think of a correction coming in
February. Guess what, we probably won’t get a correction in
February. This market has got upward momentum.”  About 74 percent of the 354 companies in the S&P 500 that
have released results during the earnings season have exceeded
profit projections, and 66 percent have beaten sales estimates,
 data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Record High  The S&P 500 has  rallied  6.6 percent in 2013 as U.S.
lawmakers reached a budget compromise. It has more than doubled
since bottoming in March 2009 as the Federal Reserve conducted
three rounds of bond-buying to lower interest rates and boost
economic growth.  The gauge is less than 3 percent below its record of
1,565.15 reached in October 2007, while the Dow is about 1
percent from its all-time high of 14,164.53.  “Every strategist I’ve talked to says that we’re due for a
5 percent, 7 percent correction, and the reason why we haven’t
seen it is because investors are buying on dips,”  Diane Jaffee ,
the New York-based group managing director for U.S. equities who
oversees about $5.9 billion in assets at TCW Group Inc., said in
a phone interview. “The thought process is that people are
willing to forgo the first 10 or 20 percent of the market rise
to make sure it will really do it, and now they want in for the
last 20 or 30 percent because they have more confidence.”  Obama Address  Obama is due to deliver his State of the Union address at 9
p.m. in Washington. He will make proposals for spending on
infrastructure, clean energy and education, according to an
administration official briefed on the speech. Obama will argue
that fostering economic growth remains the best strategy to
narrow a federal budget gap that has exceeded $1 trillion in
each of the last four years.  Seven of the 10  industry groups  in the S&P 500 rose today
as financial, phone and industrial companies performed the best,
adding at least 0.4 percent. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index,
a measure of companies whose earnings are most tied to economic
swings, climbed 0.9 percent. Bank of America Corp. surged 3.1
percent, the most in the Dow, to $12.23.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, fell 0.7 percent to 12.85.  Michael Kors , named for the designer who founded the
company, increased $5.68 to $62.68. Profit excluding certain
items will be as much as $1.82 a share in the company’s fiscal
2013, compared with a previous estimate of as much as $1.50,
Michael Kors said. Analysts estimated $1.57 a share, according
to the average of 14 projections compiled by Bloomberg.  Evaluating Alternatives  Avon Products jumped $3.76 to $21.04. The world’s largest
door-to-door cosmetics seller reported fourth-quarter adjusted
profit that topped analysts’ estimates as new Chief Executive
Officer Sheri McCoy trimmed costs. McCoy said on a conference
call that she would seek strategic alternatives for the
company’s Silpada jewelry unit, where sales fell 18 percent in
the fourth quarter.  Masco Corp.  rallied 12 percent to $19.92. The home
improvement and building products maker reported fourth-quarter
earnings and sales that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  An S&P 500 gauge of homebuilders advanced 4.1 percent, the
most since December, as all of its 11 members gained. D.R.
Horton Inc. jumped 4.7 percent to $24 while PulteGroup Inc.
added 5.1 percent to $20.29.  Fossil Inc.  surged 4.4 percent to $112.15 after the maker
of the namesake watch brand said its fourth-quarter net sales
increased 14 percent to a record $947.7 million, surpassing
estimates.  Global Volume  Coca-Cola lost $1.04 to $37.58. The world’s largest soft-
drink maker said global volume sales rose 3 percent during the
fourth quarter. That missed the 5.4 percent growth estimated by
Mark Swartzberg, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.  Facebook  declined 53 cents to $27.73.  Carlos Kirjner , an
analyst at Bernstein in New York, downgraded the stock to market
perform, the equivalent of hold, from outperform, citing a
potential slowdown in price-per-ad growth in North America and
Europe. He cut the share-price estimate by 18 percent to $27.  Dun & Bradstreet Corp. sank 6.8 percent, the most in the
S&P 500, to $79.51. The 171-year-old provider of business data
and risk-management services reported fourth-quarter earnings
that missed analysts’ estimates on sluggish North American
sales.  Style Shift  “Now is an opportune time for investors to shift their
focus to value” when looking at U.S. stocks, according to  Brian Belski , chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets.  Belski’s recommendation reflects a transition that started
last year. Shares with low prices relative to sales, earnings
and asset values are faring better than those of faster-growing
companies, according to a comparison of S&P 500 value and growth
indexes. The ratio between these indexes, which the New York-
based analyst cited in a Feb. 8 report, has climbed 7.6 percent
from last year’s low. Even so, it’s below the average end-of-
month reading for the past 20 years.  Belski isn’t alone among market strategists in preferring
value to growth. Wells Fargo & Co.’s  Gina Martin Adams , also
based in New York, wrote yesterday in a report that she saw last
year’s shift toward value stocks as a turning point.  “We suspect value will continue to have the edge over
growth in the months ahead,” she wrote. Shrinking productivity
gains point to that conclusion, the report said, as they weigh
more heavily on growth companies. Fourth-quarter productivity
rose from a year earlier by 0.6 percent, trailing the third
quarter’s 1.8 percent gain, Labor Department data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
