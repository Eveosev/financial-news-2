Chileâ€™s consumer debt registry
almost doubled in the past year as 975,000 people fell behind on
loan and credit repayments, the newspaper El Mercurio  reported
today , citing data provided by banking association Sinacofi.  The registry of consumers who are late on debt repayments
now totals 2.1 million people in a nation of 17 million, the
Santiago-based paper reported. Regulators in February 2012
deleted 2.9 million people from the registry, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
