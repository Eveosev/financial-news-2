General Electric Co.  plans to buy
back about $10 billion of stock this year as it reaps cash from
selling a 49 percent stake in NBC Universal to Comcast Corp.  The repurchase program accelerates GE’s effort to return
cash to investors, the company said today in a statement.
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE didn’t specify how much it had
previously planned on repurchasing.  Comcast agreed to buy the 49 percent of NBC Universal that
it didn’t already own for $16.7 billion and to pay GE $1.4
billion for floors at 30 Rockefeller Center in New York as well
as property in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. GE said it will see
a $1 billion pre-tax gain from the deal, and its finance unit
will get $900 million.  “This transaction allows us to significantly increase the
cash we plan to return to shareholders in 2013,” Chief
Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  said in the statement. The sale
will let GE “accelerate our share buyback plans while investing
in growth in our core businesses.”  GE will receive $12 billion in cash, $4 billion in Comcast
guaranteed debt and $700 million of preferred stock, according
to the statement. GE’s shares  jumped  3.4 percent to $23.34 at
6:07 p.m., after the close of regular trading in New York. The
shares previously gained 7.6 percent this year.  Comcast acquired its original 51 percent stake in NBC
Universal for $13.8 billion in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
