Deliveries of gasoil jumped to the
highest in at least nine years on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange as premiums of higher-value diesel slumped in the
region this year.  The amount of 0.1 percent sulfur gasoil for February
shipment surged to 629,700 metric tons, the most since at least
January 2004, the earliest available  data , according to
Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s website. That compares with
66,300 tons last month and 46,100 tons a year ago.  Deliveries were boosted by import-tenders from North
Africa, demand for the higher sulfur grade in the Mediterranean
region and a drop in diesel premiums in northwest Europe, said
 Miles Lang , an analyst at Facts Global Energy Inc. in London.  “Multiple parties are involved in the deliveries for
February 2013 and the gasoil contract has managed similarly high
delivery levels in the past,” said  Claire Miller , a spokesman
for the exchange. She declined to comment on specific
participants involved in the deliveries.  Ultra low-sulfur  diesel  fell to a premium of $3 a ton to
gasoil futures on Feb. 5 in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil
hub, the lowest since November 2009, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That compared with an average $26.44 last year,
the data show.  The smaller premium for diesel means traders are able to
blend cheaper, high-sulfur gasoil to meet ICE specification,
according to four traders of the products.  Narrow Spread  The ICE-traded spread between February and March gasoil
contracts narrowed by almost $8 a ton from 8:00 a.m. and 11:30
a.m. London time, to about $4 a ton. It then widened briefly to
about $9.50 and shrank to $1 a ton by the February contract
expiry at 12:00 p.m., according to ICE data.  February gasoil expired at $1,026.25 a ton. The March
contract dropped $4.50, or 0.4 percent, to $1,010.50 as of 5:08
p.m. London time.  Hedge funds and other money managers raised  net-long bets 
on gasoil for a seventh week to 91,036 contracts in the week
ended Feb. 5, according to data from ICE published yesterday.  February deliveries on the ultra-low-sulfur gasoil
contract, which has the same maximum sulfur level as diesel,
increased to 47,000 tons from 35,600 tons last month and 20,800
tons a year ago, according to ICE data released today. That
grade contains no more than 10 parts per million of sulfur.  To contact the reporter on this story:
