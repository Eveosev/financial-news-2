Western Union Co ., the world’s
biggest money-transfer business, fell after the company forecast
continued revenue declines in 2013.  The shares slid 3.3 percent in extended trading today after
Englewood, Colorado-based Western Union reported fourth-quarter
results. Net income plunged 47 percent to $237.9 million, or 40
cents a share, from $452.3 million, or 73 cents, a year earlier,
the company said in a statement. The average  estimate  of 28
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 35 cents.  The company said it expects “low single digit” revenue
declines in 2013 and for sales and profit growth to resume in
2014 and 2015. The firm projected full-year earnings per share
of $1.33 to $1.43.  “The strategic actions we are implementing in 2013 will
position us well for the future and drive revenue and profit
growth in 2014 and beyond,” Chief Executive Officer  Hikmet Ersek , 52, said in the statement.  Western Union dropped 47 cents to $13.87 at 5:35 p.m. in
New York. The shares had declined 18 percent in the past year
through the close of regular trading, compared with a 13 percent
gain for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
