Gasoline futures advanced in early
trading as crude climbed after OPEC forecast stronger fuel
demand in emerging economies. Calendar spreads weakened.  Gasoline for March delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent.
West Texas Intermediate oil gained 0.5 percent. The Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries raised its global oil demand
estimate by 80,000 barrels a day from last month’s report. The
March contract’s discount to April increased to the widest
contango since Feb. 29.  “The OPEC report marked demand up, and overall that’s been
constructive to energy markets,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior
vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “That’s been
the backbone of this particular rally.”  Gasoline for March delivery rose 0.53 cent to $3.0265 a
gallon at 10:15 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange, on
volume was 5.4 percent above the 100-day average.  The gap between March futures, which represent winter-grade
gasoline, and April’s contract for summer-grade fuel, increased
0.59 cent to 21 cents a gallon.  March-delivery heating oil fell 0.81 cent, or 0.3 percent,
to $3.2234 a gallon on the Nymex on volume 4.1 percent below the
100-day average for that time of day.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, rose 1.7 cents
to $3.604 a gallon, AAA said on its website today. Prices have
climbed 9.5 percent since the beginning of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
