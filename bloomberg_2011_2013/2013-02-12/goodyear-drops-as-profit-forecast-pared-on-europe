Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  fell less
than a percent after the largest U.S. tiremaker said operating
income this year would be lower than it originally forecast as
it tries to repair its European operations.  Goodyear  slipped  0.4 percent to $13.86 at the close in New
York after plunging as much as 5.8 percent. The  shares  have
risen 0.4 percent this year. Goodyear slid 2.5 percent in 2012,
compared with a 13 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Goodyear said in a statement it will earn $1.4 billion to
$1.5 billion in operating income this year, compared with an
earlier forecast of $1.6 billion as demand for tires slowed with
auto production in Europe, which is in its worst auto-sales
slump in 19 years. Automakers including  General Motors Co.  and
 Ford Motor Co.  have announced plans to close European plants.  The company said fourth-quarter sales fell 11 percent to
$5.05 billion. The average of four analysts’ estimates was $5.34
billion. Tires sold in Goodyear’s North America region fell 10
percent to $2.31 billion. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa
unit, sales decreased 16 percent to $1.6 billion, Goodyear said.
The two regions comprised almost 80 percent of Goodyear’s
 revenue  in 2011.  Plant Closing  Last month, Goodyear said it was closing its farm-tire
plant in France, cutting 39 percent of its jobs in the country,
amid labor disputes and lower demand. The closing and exiting of
the farm-tire business in the region, will improve operating
profit in the region by $75 million, Goodyear said in a U.S.
regulatory filing Jan. 31.  Goodyear reported net income fell to $7 million, or break-
even per share, compared with $18 million, or 7 cents, a year
earlier, the Akron, Ohio-based company said in its statement.
The per-share figure reflects dividends paid on preferred
shares.  Excluding expenses to close the French factory and other
one-time costs and gains, profit was 39 cents a share. The
average estimate of eight analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg was for
a profit of 20 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
