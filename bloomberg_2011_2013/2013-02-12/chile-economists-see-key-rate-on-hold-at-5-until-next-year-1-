Chilean economists expect policy
makers to hold off on raising the  benchmark interest rate  this
year, after forecasting monetary tightening by December in a
poll published last month.  Policy makers will keep the key rate unchanged at 5 percent
through December before raising it a quarter point at the start
of 2014, according to a monthly survey posted on the central
bank website today. Last month’s poll showed analysts expected
rates to reach 5.25 percent by December after staying on hold
for the first five months of 2013.  Since the last survey was released Jan. 10, economic growth
has slowed and manufacturing output has contracted. While the
inflation rate will climb this year, it won’t exceed the bank’s
target range of 2 percent to 4 percent, according to today’s
central bank poll.  Gross domestic product will increase 4.9 percent in 2013
from the previous year and 5 percent in 2014, according to
today’s survey. Analysts polled by Bloomberg estimate GDP
increased 5.45 percent in 2012.  Economic growth as measured by the Imacec index, which is a
proxy for GDP, expanded 4.7 percent in December after growing
5.5 percent in November. Manufacturing output fell 2.5 percent
in December from the previous year.  Annual inflation will accelerate to 3 percent in 11 months
from 1.6 percent in January and 1.5 percent in December,
according to today’s central bank poll.  The peso fell by less than 0.1 percent to 472.50 per U.S.
dollar at 8:43 a.m. Santiago time. Chile’s currency will trade
at 475 per dollar in two months, according to the median
estimate of 49 analysts in today’s poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
