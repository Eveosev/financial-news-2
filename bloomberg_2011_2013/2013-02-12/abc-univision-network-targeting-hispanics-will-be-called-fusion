Walt Disney Co .’s ABC and  Univision ,
the Spanish-language television network, said their jointly
owned cable network targeting U.S. Hispanics will be called
Fusion.  The Miami-based channel will start in the second half of
the year, the companies said today in an e-mailed statement.  With the English-language service, the companies are
targeting the fast-growing U.S. Hispanic population. They said
in May 2012 they planned to collaborate on issues targeting the
group, whose population may represent 30 percent of the U.S. by
2050, compared with 16 percent at the time.  “Fusion will be the indispensible meeting place for
English-speaking Latinos,”  Ben Sherwood , president of ABC News,
said in the statement. “Our goal is for this young, vibrant and
media hungry audience to come to Fusion to be informed,
entertained and empowered.”  Disney, the entertainment company based in Burbank,
California, added 0.2 percent to $54.75 at the close in New
York. The shares have adbanced 10 percent this year. Univision,
based in New York, is privately held.  To contact the reporter on this story:
