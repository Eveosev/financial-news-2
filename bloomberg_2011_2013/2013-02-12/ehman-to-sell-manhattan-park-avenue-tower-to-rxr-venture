Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. has a
tentative deal to sell 237 Park Ave., a 21-story office tower
near New York’s Grand Central Terminal, to a joint venture
including  Scott Rechler ’s RXR Realty LLC.  Rechler is teaming with Walton Street Capital LLC, a
closely held real estate investment firm based in Chicago,
according to a statement from the buyers. The group agreed to
pay about $800 million for the 1.25 million-square-foot
(116,000-square-meter) property, said a person with knowledge of
the deal, who asked not to be identified because the
negotiations are private.  The deal would continue Lehman’s selloff of real estate
that began as it was negotiating its emergence from the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history. In November, it agreed to sell the
assets of Archstone Inc., an apartment landlord, to Equity
Residential and AvalonBay Communities Inc. for $6.5 billion.  “Two years ago, we tried to buy the debt on it, because we
saw it as a real value-added opportunity,” Rechler said in a
telephone interview. “This gives us the opportunity to
reposition it and bring it to the stature that it deserves based
on its location on Park Avenue adjacent to Grand Central.”  Rechler Purchases  For Rechler, the second-biggest buyer of New York office
properties since 2009, the purchase would give him two towers
across the street from one another just northeast of the
regional rail hub. Last year he bought the leasehold on 450
Lexington Ave., a 40-story building across East 45th Street from
237 Park Ave., for $688 million.  Last month, RXR agreed to buy a 99-year leasehold interest
in 75 Rockefeller Plaza, a 33-story skyscraper completed in
1947. That tower, the final building constructed as part of
Rockefeller Center, is to be vacated next year in anticipation
of a top-to-bottom renovation.  The pending sale of 273 Park Ave. was reported earlier
today in the Wall Street Journal.  Kimberly Macleod , a Lehman spokeswoman, said she couldn’t
immediately comment.  The building is 80 percent occupied, according to the
statement. Tenants include Credit Suisse Group AG, whose lease
on about 270,000 square feet expires in 2014, and the
advertising firm J. Walter Thompson Co., whose 270,000-square-
foot agreement expires in 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Broadway Partners purchased the tower with financing from
Lehman as part of a $5 billion, 10 million-square-foot portfolio
in 2007, as real estate values were peaking. The lender took
control of the property in 2011, according to Bloomberg data.  The tower has about $420 million of performing senior debt
that is part of a commercial mortgage-backed security, maturing
in 2017, with a fixed interest rate of 6.27 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
