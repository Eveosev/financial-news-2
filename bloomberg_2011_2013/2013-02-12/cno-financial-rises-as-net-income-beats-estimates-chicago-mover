CNO Financial Group Inc ., the
insurer that counts John Paulson’s hedge fund as its largest
shareholder, advanced the most in five months after fourth-
quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates.  CNO rose 5.1 percent to $10.81 at 12:20 p.m. in New York,
the second-best performer of the 259-company  Dow Jones U.S.
Financials Index . It was the Carmel, Indiana-based firm’s
biggest intraday gain since September and highest price since
June 2008.  Fourth-quarter  net income  increased 60 percent to $101.2
million, or 41 cents a share, from $64.4 million, or 23 cents, a
year earlier, the company said yesterday in a statement.
Operating profit, which excludes some investment results, was 25
cents a share, beating the 23-cent average estimate of seven
analysts in a Bloomberg survey and the 22-cent estimate of  Sean Dargan , a Macquarie Group Ltd. analyst.  “CNO shares will react favorably to the 4Q12 earnings
report,” Dargan wrote in a Feb. 11 research note. He has a
neutral rating on the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
