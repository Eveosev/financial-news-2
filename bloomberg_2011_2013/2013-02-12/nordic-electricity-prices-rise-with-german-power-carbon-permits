Nordic electricity prices advanced
after German power and the cost of carbon allowances increased.  The benchmark near-quarter contract rose as much as 0.8
percent to 36.60 euros ($49.21) a megawatt-hour and closed at
36.45 euros on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo.
The March contract gained 1.3 percent to 38 euros before closing
at 37.90 euros.  EU carbon permits for December climbed as much as 5.4
percent to 4.72 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London. Emission prices can influence generating
costs at coal- and gas-fed plants. German power for baseload
delivery next quarter rose as much as 1.1 percent to 37.75 euros
a megawatt-hour, broker data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Electricity usually flows from where it’s cheapest to
produce to more expensive areas, which means Nordic contracts
typically track the movements of their equivalents in German
power derivatives.  Today’s temperature forecasts for the next two weeks in
Scandinavia are 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (2 to 4 degrees
Fahrenheit) milder than yesterday, Danish energy trading company
Energi Danmark A/S said today on its website. Higher
temperatures reduce the need for heating.  The Nordic region meets more than half of its power needs
by running water through turbines. The amount of water and snow
available to generate electricity in the region may be 15.3
terawatt-hours below normal for the time of year in two weeks,
down from 11.8 terawatt-hours today, Markedskraft AS data on
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
