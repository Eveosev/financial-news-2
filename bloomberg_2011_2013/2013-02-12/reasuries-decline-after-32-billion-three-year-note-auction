     Feb. 12 (Bloomberg) --Treasuries declined for a second day
as the government sold $32 billion in three-year notes at
higher-than-forecast yields amid signs record U.S. budget
deficits may be stabilizing.  The notes drew a yield of 0.411 percent, compared with a
forecast of 0.409 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of
the Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers. Direct bidders, non-
primary-dealer investors that place their bids directly with the
Treasury, purchased a record amount for the third straight
auction, while  indirect bidders , an investor class that includes
foreign central banks, bought the all-time lowest amount. The
U.S. government posted a January budget surplus for the first
time in five years, reflecting higher revenue from payroll and
individual income taxes.  “We are at an equilibrium point in the market,” said
 Justin Lederer , an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald
LP in New York, a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions. “The whole yield curve is very range bound and we
should continue to stay near these levels until there is a
reason to break out.”  Benchmark 10-year note yields rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.98 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent
note due in November 2022 decline 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face
amount, to 96 28/32.  The yield on the current three-year note gained one basis
point to 0.40 percent.  Bidding Details  Treasury is due to sell $24 billion of 10-year securities
tomorrow and $16 billion of 30-year bonds the next day.  The  bid-to-cover ratio  at today’s note sale, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
offered, was 3.59, matching the average for the past 10 sales.
The record-low three-year auction yield of 0.327 percent was
reached Dec. 11.  Direct bidders  purchased 26.9 percent at today’s sale,
topping a record 26.4 percent of the notes at the January sale.
The average for the past 10 auctions is 15.9 percent.  The direct bids are “a function of confidence that the Fed
remains on hold, as upside risk on yield in the front end are
limited”  Adrian Miller , director of fixed income strategies at
GMP Securities LLC in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“We’ve rising yields on the long end since the last auctions,
which should bring investors in.”  Auction Data  Indirect bidders  purchased 18 percent of the notes, the
lowest on record, compared with 28.4 percent at the previous
sale and the average of 30.3 percent for the past 10 sales.  Markets in Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan
are closed for Lunar New Year holidays today.  “The holidays and technical currency issues weighed on the
indirect bid,” said  Thomas di Galoma , a managing director at
Navigate Advisors LLC, a brokerage for institutional investors
in Stamford, Connecticut. “The auction performed well, and
isn’t moving from where we are. Now the question turns to the
long-end auctions, and the questions will be whether we have
cheapened up enough or not.”  This week’s auctions will raise $8 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $64 billion,
according to the Treasury.  Price Swings  Volatility in Treasuries dropped yesterday to 60 basis
points, close to the 59.9 basis points reached on Feb. 7, the
lowest level in two weeks, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE  index, which measures price swings based on
options.  The measure reached 51 basis points on Dec. 3, the lowest
level of price swings since the gauge begin in April 1988. It
hit a 2012 high of 95.4 basis points on June 15. Volatility
climbed to 264.6 basis points in October 2008 as the financial
crisis intensified.  Treasury trading  volume  rose to $246.7 billion, after
falling yesterday to the lowest level since Jan. 7, according to
ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government
debt. Daily volume has averaged $297.9 billion in 2013.  Budget Update  U.S. government receipts exceeded outlays by $2.88 billion,
compared with a $27.4 billion deficit in January 2012, according
to Treasury Department data issued today in Washington.
Economists projected a $2 billion shortfall, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The nation had a $17.8
billion surplus in January 2008.  Economists said a government report tomorrow will show U.S.
retail sales increased for a third month in January. U.S. retail
sales increased 0.1 percent last month after a 0.5 percent
advance in December, according to the  median forecast  of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before tomorrow’s Commerce
Department report.  Treasuries handed investors a 0.8 percent loss this year
through yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. Three-year notes have lost 0.02 percent this year,
after returning 0.6 percent last year.  The 10-year note will yield 1.96 percent at the end of June
and 2.24 percent by Dec. 31, according to the weighted average
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The Fed purchased $3.3 billion of securities maturing
between February 2020 and November 2022 today as part of its
plan to bolster the economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
