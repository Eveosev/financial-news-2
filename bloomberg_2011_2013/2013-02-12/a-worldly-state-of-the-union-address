In his past three State of the Union
addresses, President  Barack Obama  devoted less than 15 percent
of his speech to the world beyond the U.S. So those speech
paragraphs are pricey real estate. We asked some Bloomberg View
columnists and regular contributors what foreign policy issues
they thought the president should raise in the first State of
the Union of his second term. Links to their suggestions are
below:  Jonathan Alter  on  fighting terrorism morally .  Clive Crook  on
 expanding trade .  Edward Glaeser  on  economic freedom .  Jeffrey Goldberg  on  Israel and the Palestinians .  Megan Greene  on  Europe
and the economy .  Albert R. Hunt  on  democracy promotion .  Simon Johnson  on the  real Chinese economic threat .  Tim Judah  on
 cooperating with the EU .  Pankaj Mishra  on the “ pivot to Asia .”
 Virginia Postrel  on  intellectual property .  Amity Shlaes  on  U.S.
leadership .  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:
