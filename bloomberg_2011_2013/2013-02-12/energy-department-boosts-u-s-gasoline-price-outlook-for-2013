Drivers in the U.S. will pay more at
the pump in 2013 than earlier expected, the U.S. Energy
Department said.  Regular-grade gasoline will average $3.55 a gallon, up from
$3.44 in last month’s forecast, the department’s Energy
Information Administration said today in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook . Prices in 2012 averaged $3.63 a gallon.  Prices may average $3.39 in 2014, the department estimated,
up from $3.34 in last month’s forecast.  Gasoline  consumption  this year will average 8.73 million
barrels a day, the same as in last month’s projection and up
from 8.72 million last year. Demand in 2014 could be 8.72
million barrels a day, down from last month’s forecast of 8.73
million barrels a day.  Distillate demand, including heating oil and diesel, will
be 3.77 million barrels a day this year, down from the last
month’s outlook of 3.8 million. Consumption in 2014 is estimated
to be 3.83 million barrels, the same as last month’s projection.  The department expects households heating primarily with
oil to spend an average of about $2,459 during the winter season
from Oct. 1 to March 31. That’s 18 percent higher than last
winter, as a result of a 4.5 percent gain in prices and a 13
percent increase in consumption. In January, the EIA  forecast 
consumers would spend an average of about $2,558.  About 6 percent of U.S. households depend on heating oil
for space heating. The Northeast accounts for about 80 percent
of these households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
