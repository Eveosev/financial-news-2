Copper rose for the second time in
three sessions on signs that an economic recovery is gaining
traction as company earnings and business sentiment improve in
the U.S., the world’s second-biggest user of the metal.  Confidence among small businesses rose in January, a report
showed today. About 74 percent of the 354 companies in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that have released results during
the earnings season exceeded profit projections, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Through yesterday, the equity gauge climbed
6.4 percent this year.  “Copper is holding up well as the overall economy is
showing gains,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist
at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “With equity prices buoyant, that supports
the global-growth story.”  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for March delivery
advanced 0.6 percent to $3.744 a pound at 1:14 p.m. The price
has climbed 2.5 percent this year.  Financial markets are closed this week in China for the
Lunar New Year holiday, damping copper demand, and  stockpiles 
tracked by the London Metal Exchange have climbed to the highest
since November 2011.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months increased
0.5 percent to $8,236 a metric ton ($3.74 a pound). Aluminum,
tin, zinc nickel and lead also gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
