Multinational corporations’ use of
aggressive tax planning to shift profits to low-tax countries
poses a serious risk to fairness and tax revenue, according to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Tax systems haven’t kept pace with changes in how companies
do business, allowing corporations to book their profits from
intellectual property in jurisdictions without income taxes even
though their customers are in developed countries with corporate
levies, the OECD said in a report being released today in Paris.  “What is at stake is the integrity of the  corporate income
tax ,” said the report. Failing to respond, it says, would
create “unintended competitive advantages compared with
enterprises that operate mostly at the domestic level.”  The report called for coordinated action by governments to
plug gaps between their tax systems, and it said there is an
“urgent need” to solve the problem. Companies have urged
countries to prevent double taxation of the same income by
multiple jurisdictions while taking advantage of “double non-
taxation,” situations where income is effectively taxed
nowhere, according to the report.  “It may be difficult for any single country, acting alone,
to fully address the issue,” the report said.  The OECD is an association of 34 developed countries,
including the U.S., Canada, Germany and Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
