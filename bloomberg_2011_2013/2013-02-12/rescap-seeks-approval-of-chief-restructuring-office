Residential Capital LLC asked a
bankruptcy judge to approve the appointment of a chief
restructuring officer to help it reach and confirm a
reorganization plan following its assets sale.  ResCap filed a request yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Manhattan to appoint  Lewis Kruger .  Kruger has worked as a restructuring attorney for more than
40 years, ResCap said in the filing. He is a partner and co-
chairman of the financial restructuring group at  Stroock &
Stroock & Lavan LLP , according to the filing.  “He has substantial knowledge and experience advising
large companies and assisting troubled companies developing
appropriate business plans to accomplish restructuring
initiatives,” ResCap said. “The debtors believe that Mr.
Kruger’s vast restructuring experience will be invaluable in
leading plan negotiations and in the ongoing mediation.”  New York-based ResCap filed for bankruptcy in May with
plans to sell its major assets and resolve legal claims related
to mortgage loans. The company is owned by  Ally Financial Inc .,
a Detroit-based lender majority owned by U.S. taxpayers.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
