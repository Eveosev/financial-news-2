Paintings by  Francis Bacon ,  Gerhard Richter  and  Jean-Michel Basquiat  boosted a $117 million auction,
the year’s first major test of demand for contemporary art.  Bacon’s “Three Studies for a Self-Portrait” sold for 13.8
million pounds with fees ($21.6 million) and a Basquiat painting
once owned by the rock band U2 fetched 6.8 million pounds at
last night’s London sale by  Sotheby’s .  The U.K. capital’s auction houses, Sotheby’s,  Christie’s
International  and Phillips, are looking this week to maintain
the momentum in New York in November when they raised a record
$1.1 billion from contemporary sales. While there were some high
quality works up for auction, some material was more routine and
bidding was less frenzied in London, dealers said.  “The auction houses are finding it more difficult to get
top quality material,” said New York-based Jonathan P. Binstock,
senior adviser in postwar and contemporary art at Citi Private
Bank. “Not a whizz-bang sale. It was solid nonetheless.”  Bacon painted the portrait, one of 11 smaller-scale
triptychs, in 1980, a less sought-after period than the 1960s
and 1970s. It is the only work for sale all week that carries an
eight-figure estimate (10 million pounds to 15 million pounds).  The lot had been entered by a European collector, who
acquired it at auction in June 2006 for 3.8 million pounds, and
had no guaranteed price. Nadia Abbas of Sotheby’s Cologne
office, acting for a client, was successful over another
telephone bidder. The current auction high for this type of
triple self-portrait is the 17.3 million pounds paid for a 1975
version at Christie’s in 2008.  Richter Sales  This Sotheby’s event included four paintings by Richter,
the biggest-selling living artist at auction in 2012, according
to the  Artnet  database in New York. Last year, the German racked
up $298.9 million of sales, a 48.8 percent increase on 2011.  “Abstraktes Bild (769-1)” from 1992 and the 1976
photorealist painting “Wolke (Cloud)” were estimated to fetch at
least 7.5 million pounds and 7 million pounds respectively. Both
sold for hammer prices below these figures.  The large abstract, distinguished by its vertically
louvered gradations of blue, yellow and red, was being sold by a
European collector and hadn’t been seen at auction before.  It sold for 8.2 million pounds with fees to a telephone
bidder, while “Wolke” fell to another phone bid of 7.6 million
pounds. It had been bought by its seller for 1 million pounds at
this same London auction room in 1999.  Two lots of Richter abstracts -- a single canvas from 1986
and a quartet of small grey compositions from 1990 -- failed to
sell against low estimates of 1 million pounds and 600,000
pounds.  “Not all Richters are created equal,” Binstock said. “You
can’t always expect extraordinary prices for pictures that have
the right kind of date.”  Basquiat Presence  Basquiat has become a mainstay of the Top 10 price lists at
contemporary art auctions, thanks to the support of  Jose Mugrabi 
and other New York collectors.  The former graffiti artist’s acrylic, oilstick and collage
painting “Untitled (Pecho/Oreja)” was sold by U2 for 5.1 million
pounds at Sotheby’s, London, in July 2008.  The 1982-1983 work, featuring one of Basquiat’s mask-like
heads, inscribed “chest” and “ear” in Spanish, was re-offered
for sale with an estimate of 7 million pounds to 9 million
pounds.  Mugrabi’s Purchases  It was bought by Mugrabi, sitting in the second row of the
saleroom. The New York collector also paid 5 million pounds for
Basquiat’s text-heavy 1983 triptych “Five Fish Species,”
estimated at 4.25 million pounds to 6.25 million pounds.  Cautious, within-estimate bidding was the pattern for most
of the evening.  “If you’ve got a great thing, you’re going to sell it in
the summer rather than February,” said Heinrich zu Hohenlohe,
director of the Berlin branch of the dealership  Dickinson . “The
consignors are dictating the situation.”  Among the few works to generate above-estimate prices from
multiple bidders was a quartet of  Alexander Calder  painted
mobiles from a Swedish private collection that hadn’t been seen
on the market for at least 40 years. Offered at the beginning of
the evening to kick-start the sale, these raised 2.5 million
pounds.  About half a dozen bidders pushed the colorful small-scale
table piece “Untitled” to a top price of 892,450 pounds against
a high estimate of 200,000 pounds. Resembling a tiny merry-go-
round, it was bought by  Cheyenne Westphal , Sotheby’s European
head of contemporary art, representing a telephone bidder, who
gave a further 646,050 pounds for Calder’s similarly estimated
1945 mobile “Red Skeleton.”  Sci-Fi Head  By contrast, Glenn Brown’s swirly 2000 painting of a sci-fi
head, “Little Death,” had been bought by its seller for 601,250
pounds at Bonhams, London, in 2011. Bidders regarded this as a
premature return to the market and it was acquired by a
telephone bidder for 577,250 pounds -- representing a loss of at
least 120,000 pounds for the owner when auction house fees are
deducted.  Sotheby’s total of 74.4 million pounds with fees was
slightly below the high estimate of 78 million pounds, based on
hammer prices. The result was still the company’s second-highest
for a February contemporary-art sale. Of the 54 lots, 81.5
percent were sold. The equivalent event last year raised 50.7
million pounds from 64 lots.  ( Scott Reyburn  writes about the art market for Muse, the
