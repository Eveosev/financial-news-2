Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened on speculation that the biofuel’s best yearly start
since 2006 will spur competition from imports.  The spread expanded 3.91 cents to 66.33 cents a gallon, the
widest since Sept. 28, on concern that ethanol’s 9 percent jump
so far this year will open a spigot of Brazilian imports,
displacing supply of the corn-derived domestic variety.  “It does encourage the import side of things,” said Mike
Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in Des Moines, Iowa.
“That’s the negative part of the market.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery decreased 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.387 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The fuel’s surge to start 2013 is the biggest for this time of
year since 2006, when the additive jumped 31 percent from the
end of 2005 to Feb. 13, 2006.  Gasoline for March delivery climbed 2.91 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.0503 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
blended with ethanol.  Ethanol prices have risen as the industry has shut at least
19 plants to help drain a glut of the fuel and combat higher
production costs, according to the Renewable Fuels Association,
a Washington-based trade group.  The U.S. didn’t  import  any of the fuel in the week ended
Feb. 1, the first such instance since Sept. 28, data from the
Energy Information Administration show.  Ethanol Imports  In November, the most recent month available, the country
imported 33,000 barrels of ethanol a day, the highest amount
since September 2008, according to  data  from the Energy
Department’s statistical agency.  Brazil, where sugarcane is used to make the biofuel, is the
biggest supplier of ethanol to the U.S., EIA  data  show.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.29 a gallon in the week
ended today, up from $2.21 the previous week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, and 3.8 percent cheaper than the current
futures price.  Ethanol industry advocates have criticized U.S. regulations
that consider the Brazilian sugarcane-based variety superior to
the domestic corn-made grade.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
 RINs , for advanced forms of ethanol, which includes Brazilian
grade, rose to 56.5 cents yesterday, or more than double the
worth of the  conventional sort , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Crush Spread  Ethanol companies have battled more expensive production
costs in the face of higher corn prices in the wake of a drought
in the Midwest that battered crops.  Corn for March delivery dropped 6 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$6.9625 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, or the profit that can be made from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 14 cents a
gallon, up from minus 16 cents yesterday, the highest level
since June.  “Margins have improved dramatically,” Blackford said.
“They’re showing the weakness in production and they’re trying
to respond to the plant closings.”  Poet LLC, the second-biggest U.S. ethanol producer,  Valero
Energy Corp. , the third-largest, and  Abengoa SA , are among
companies that have idled operations.  Production  in the week ended Feb. 1 rose 0.5 percent to
774,000 barrels a day from the previous week, the lowest level
since the EIA began tracking weekly data for the biofuel in June
2010.  Spot prices for ethanol fell in most regional hubs,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol slipped 4 cents to $2.56 a gallon on the West
Coast, the highest price in the nation. It fell 3 cents to $2.50
in New York, 1.13 cents to $2.40 in Chicago, and 1.5 cent to
$2.445 on the Gulf Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
