Australian  shares  rose to the
highest level in nearly three years, with the benchmark equities
gauge touching 5,000, after earnings from Commonwealth Bank of
Australia and CSL Ltd. boosted investor optimism.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the nation’s largest
lender, climbed 2.4 percent as retail banking and wealth
management boosted first-half profit by 1 percent. CSL advanced
0.9 percent as Australia’s biggest pharmaceutical company
reported a 24 percent increase in first-half profit.  The S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.8 percent to 5,000.20 as of
10:35 a.m. in Sydney, heading for the highest closing level
since April 2010. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.2 percent to
4,209.685.  Of the 299 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, a
benchmark for Asian equities, that reported  earnings  this
quarter and for which Bloomberg has estimates, 53 percent have
exceeded profit expectations. Some 53 percent have missed sales
projections. That compares with 74 percent of S&P 500 companies
that topped profit forecasts during the period, while 34 percent
fell short of sales estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
