Elbit Imaging Ltd. ’s 2015 bonds
fell, sending the yield to the highest in almost five months,
after Calcalist reported  Bank Hapoalim Ltd.  seeks to appoint a
receiver for the company’s shares. Government bonds dropped.  The yield on Elbit Imaging’s 5.7 percent notes maturing
October 2015 soared 281 basis points, or 2.81 percentage points,
to 30.61 percent, the highest since Sept. 27, at the close in
Tel Aviv. The government’s 4.25 percent benchmark bonds due in
2023 yielded 4.06 percent, up one basis point.  Bank Hapoalim  intends to put Elbit Imaging shares it has as
collateral into receivership, Israeli daily Calcalist reported
today. This comes as the debt-ridden company, which last week
asked to delay 82 million shekels ($22 million) in principal
payments due Feb. 20, is trying to start talks with bondholders
and reach a framework that will enable it to meet its
commitments.  “Bank Hapoalim’s move brings a bigger and more aggressive
player to the debt negotiations making it harder to reach a debt
settlement in the near term,”  Adar Etzioni , head of research at
Tel Aviv-based Migdal Capital Markets Ltd., said today by phone.  Bank Hapoalim spokeswoman  Ofra Preuss  declined to comment
on the report. A phone call and a text message to Motti Scherf,
a spokesman for Elbit Imaging, weren’t answered. The yield on
Elbit Imaging’s 5 percent bonds due April 2020 rose for a second
day, increasing 288 basis points to 61.62 percent.  Rating Cut  S&P Maalot on Feb. 5 cut Elbit Imaging’s rating by five
levels to ilCC, two grades above default, saying it’s possible
the company may miss debt payments in the immediate term. The
Tel Aviv-based company, which invests in real estate and medical
companies, faces more than 600 million shekels in debt payments
this year and has reserves of about 80 million shekels, Moody’s
Midroog said last month.  The  Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index , which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, declined for a second day,
slipping 0.1 percent to 283.27. Israel’s average annual
inflation expectation fell two basis points to 2.12 percent,
according to the two-year break-even rate, the yield difference
between the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government
debt of similar maturity. The government’s target range is
between 1 percent to 3 percent.  The shekel weakened for a second day, depreciating 0.1
percent to 3.6962 a dollar at 4:41 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The
currency has gained 0.3 percent this month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an
indicator of investor expectations for rates over the period,
rose for the first time since Feb. 4, gaining two basis points
to 1.72 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
