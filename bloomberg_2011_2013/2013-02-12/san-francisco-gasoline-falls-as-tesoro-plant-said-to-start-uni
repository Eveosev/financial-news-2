Spot gasoline in San Francisco
weakened to the lowest level against futures in more than two
weeks as refiners including  BP Plc  and  Tesoro Corp . were said to
be restarting equipment after repairs.  Tesoro’s 170,000-barrel-a-day  Golden Eagle  refinery is
restarting a hydrocracker after replacing equipment, a person
with direct knowledge of the work said today. The unit is
expected to return to full rates within two days, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
 San Francisco  narrowed 7 cents to 1.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:04 p.m.

by Bloomberg show. Prompt delivery in San Francisco fell 4.09
cents to $3.0653 a gallon.  The Golden Eagle refinery’s hydrocracker was shut Feb. 2
after a hole was found in a line, a person with knowledge of the
outage said Feb. 4. The repairs, initially expected to take
three weeks, were finished ahead of scheduled using equipment
the plant had at hand, two people familiar with operations there
said today.  Tesoro’s 97,000-barrel-a-day  Wilmington  refinery near Los
Angeles was expected to finish a maintenance turnaround last
week, two people familiar with the work said Feb. 6. BP’s  Carson 
refinery was scheduled to flare through Feb. 16 as it starts
units following planned work.  L.A. Carbob  Carbob in  Los Angeles  slipped 0.5 cent to 29 cents a gallon
above Nymex futures, the lowest premium for the fuel in four
days. Prompt delivery gained 2.41 cents to $3.3403 a gallon.  Tina Barbee , a Tesoro spokeswoman at the company’s
headquarters in San Antonio, said by e-mail today that both the
Wilmington and Golden Eagle plants are performing planned work.
She didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for
comment on the hydrocracker’s restart.  San Francisco Carbob  weakened  6.5 cents to a discount of
27.5 cents a gallon against the fuel in Los Angeles, the biggest
spread since Jan. 25. The gap reached a record 32.5 cents a
gallon on Jan. 14.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in  Los Angeles  was
unchanged at an 8.5-cent-a-gallon premium to Nymex heating oil
futures. The same fuel in  San Francisco  slid 1.25 cents to a
premium of 10.25 cents a gallon.  Portland Prices  In  Portland , low-sulfur diesel gained 1 cent a gallon to 6
cents above heating oil futures.  Conventional , 84-octane

measure of refining profitability, reached a year-low of $3.858
a barrel on Dec. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
