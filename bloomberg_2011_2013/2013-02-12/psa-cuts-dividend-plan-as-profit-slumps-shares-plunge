Telekomunikacja Polska SA , Poland’s
largest phone company, cut its dividend proposal for the second
time in four months after fourth-quarter profit and revenue
slumped, driving the stock to a record 33 percent drop.  Telekomunikacja Polska, controlled by  France Telecom SA ,
plans a  dividend  of 0.50 zloty a share, compared with 1 zloty
announced in October and the 1.50 zloty paid on 2011 profit. Net
income fell 86 percent to 51 million zloty ($16.4 million) from
358 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based company said
in a filing today. Profit missed the 166.8 million-zloty average
of nine analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Polish telecommunications market is going through the
moment of the most severe changes in its history,” Chief
Executive Officer  Maciej Witucki  told reporters by phone today.
“Even though we are increasing market share, the market’s
shrinking and revenue growth isn’t possible.”  Revenue at TPSA, as the company is known, has fallen since
2007 as competition increased and the country’s phone regulator
forced operators to cut prices. The watchdog is lowering the
rates that mobile phone operators charge each other for calls to
their networks, while competition from wireless providers is
eroding fixed-line revenue. TPSA expects a “deep” decline in
sales this year, it said today.  Shares Slump  Its shares  plunged  3.82 zloty to 7.82 zloty, the steepest
intraday drop and the lowest price since the company’s listing
in Warsaw in 1998, and closed 28 percent lower at 8.39 zloty.
 France Telecom  lost 0.9 percent to close at 7.809 euros in
Paris, the lowest since October 2002.  Netia SA , TPSA’s biggest
publicly traded competitor in Poland, slumped 13 percent to 3.91
zloty, closing at the lowest level since October 2009.  “The guidance for the telecommunications market in 2013
will scare investors, the dividend outlook is miserable, the
strategy does not really bring any optimism for the future,
while the 2013 cash-flow guidance is shockingly low,”  Piotr Janik , a Warsaw-based analyst at KBC Securities, said in a note.  The Polish company’s dividend plans won’t affect France
Telecom’s investor- payout  strategy, the Paris-based phone
operator said today.  2011 Gain  Fourth-quarter sales at TPSA declined 6.4 percent to 3.48
billion zloty as revenue from mobile-phone services fell 6.3
percent to 1.82 billion zloty. In the year-earlier period,
Telekomunikacja booked a 260 million-zloty tax refund after it
ended a decade-long legal dispute with GN Store Nord A/S.  Full-
year net income fell 55 percent to 855 million zloty from 1.92
billion zloty.  TPSA will cut investments to below 2 billion zloty this
year and plans to limit the spending to 12 percent to 13 percent
of annual sales, the company said. The operator started the
disposal of its Internet portal Wirtualna Polska and plans to
merge fixed-line and mobile-phone operations to cut costs.  Further reductions of expenses will come from cutting 1,700
jobs in 2013 and more in subsequent years, Witucki said.  The disposal of the fixed-line business would be
“complicated” and “wouldn’t be my first choice,” the CEO
told analysts today. At the same time, TPSA is considering all
options for selling units or setting up partnerships, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
