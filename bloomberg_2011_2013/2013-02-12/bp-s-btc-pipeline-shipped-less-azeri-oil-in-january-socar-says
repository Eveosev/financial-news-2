The  BP Plc -led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline shipped less Azeri crude oil last month, according to

January, down 7.2 percent from a year earlier, data on Socar’s
website show. The company didn’t give a reason for the decline.  Azerbaijan, the largest oil producer in the former Soviet
Union after Russia and Kazakhstan, pumped 43 million metric tons
of oil in 2012, down 5.3 percent from 2011, the State Statistics
Committee said Jan. 17. Production of marketable natural gas
rose 5.4 percent to 17.2 billion cubic meters, it said.  The 1,768-kilometer (1,100-mile) BTC link, which connects
Azerbaijan’s Caspian Sea coast with Turkey’s Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan via Georgia, also carried 196,447 tons of Turkmen oil
