Kenya will offer as many as nine oil
and gas exploration licenses in the first quarter, said  Patrick Nyoike , an official at the Energy Ministry.  Chevron Corp . and  Eni SpA  have said they may bid for the
licenses, Nyoike told reporters in Nairobi today. Some of the
acreage was relinquished by explorers, and the blocks will be
repackaged for the sale.  Tullow Oil Corp. and  Africa Oil Corp . made Kenya’s first
oil discovery last March. The country has no proven oil
reserves, though Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron found gas in the
Anza Basin in 1976.  The licenses will be offered “as soon as we get the
coordinates right,” he said. “I am talking about this month.
Many companies have showed interest.”  East Africa has become one of the world’s most active
exploration areas since  Anadarko Petroleum Corp . made the
decade’s biggest gas discovery off Mozambique. An oil find would
be a boon for Kenya as the commodity is easier to sell than the
gas found in neighboring Tanzania and Mozambique, which will
require spending at least $50 billion on export plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
