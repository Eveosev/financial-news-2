Libya will temporarily close its
land borders with Egypt and Tunisia as part of efforts to
bolster security ahead of the anniversary of the uprising that
ousted  Muammar Qaddafi , Prime Minister  Ali Zaidan  said.  The move, effective Feb. 14 through Feb. 18, comes amid
concerns the second anniversary of the uprising may be marred by
violence in a nation where the government has struggled to
maintain order and faces criticism that itâ€™s accomplished few of
the goals of the revolution.  Zaidan, who took the premiership in October, said
authorities were also boosting security and controls at airports
and other facilities, the state-run Libya News Agency reported
late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
