President  Barack Obama  can join the
pantheon of free-trade heroes if, in his State of the Union
address, he forcefully advocates the cause of a trade union with
Europe. The potential benefits for U.S. companies and consumers
are  enormous .  The risks to U.S. labor are far lower than with trade deals
involving lower-wage countries.  The president was a lackluster leader on free trade in his
first term, signing just three new free-trade agreements, which
all began negotiations in the George W. Bush administration.
Obama also  accepted  the pernicious “Buy American” provisions
of the stimulus package.  He should use his address to make the U.S. a leading voice
once again for economic freedom: the freedom of consumers to buy
European goods and the freedom of producers to sell their goods
on the other side of the Atlantic.  The administration is starting the process of moving toward
trade talks with Europe. The horse-trading will get tricky, and
the president shouldn’t tie his hands. He should use his bully
pulpit to get Americans excited about the opportunities that
free trade can create, and to get Europeans energized about the
U.S. desire to bargain in good faith.  ( Edward Glaeser , an economics professor at Harvard
