Australian  shares  rose to the
highest level in nearly three years as investors dissected
earnings reports at companies from Commonwealth Bank of
Australia to CSL Ltd. Japanese stock futures were little changed
as the yen jumped, curbing the earnings outlook for exporters.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the nation’s largest
lender, climbed 2.6 percent as retail banking and wealth
management boosted first-half profit by 1 percent. CSL advanced
1 percent as Australia’s biggest pharmaceutical company reported
a 24 percent increase in first-half profit. Shares of THK Co.
may be active in Tokyo as the maker of industrial machinery
increased its full-year profit forecast 11 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 11,370 in Chicago yesterday, up from 11,340 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
11,350 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index gained 0.7 percent, headed for the highest closing level
since April 2010. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.2 percent.  Equity markets in Singapore and Malaysia reopen today after
a public holiday, while markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and
Vietnam remain shut.  Of the 299 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific index that
reported  earnings  this quarter and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 53 percent have exceeded profit expectations. Some 53
percent have missed sales projections. That compares with 74
percent of S&P 500 companies that topped profit forecasts during
the period, while 34 percent fell short of sales estimates, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. Futures  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.9 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.7 for the S&P 500 and a multiple of 12.3 for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1
percent. The gauge climbed 0.2 percent yesterday to the highest
level since November 2007 as earnings topped estimates and
investors awaited President Barack Obama’s State of the Union
address. That left the gauge less than 3 percent below its
record of 1,565.15 reached in October 2007, while the Dow Jones
Industrial Average is about 1 percent from its all-time high of
14,164.53.  The S&P 500 has rallied 6.5 percent in 2013 as U.S.
lawmakers reached a budget compromise and companies reported
better-than-estimated profits. That’s more than double the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index’s gain of 3.1 percent this year through
yesterday.  Yen Strengthens  The yen rose against all 16 major peers after an official
from the Group of Seven nations, who requested not to be further
identified, said the group is concerned about excess moves in
the yen and investors misinterpreted an earlier statement on
exchange rates. The clarification came hours after the world’s
major industrial economies appeared to signal acceptance of a
weaker Japanese currency as long as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
government didn’t actively pursue devaluation.  Data tomorrow may show Japan’s economy emerged from its
third recession in five years last quarter as cold weather
boosted consumption, bolstering Abe’s campaign to revive growth.
Gross domestic product probably expanded an annualized 0.4
percent the three months through December, according to the
median forecast in a survey of 32 economists. Banks including
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. raised their forecasts
from a contraction this month after a gauge of consumption rose.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. climbed 0.2 percent to 96.33 in New
York yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
