  Dragon Oil Plc , an explorer focused
on Turkmenistan, said production growth in 2013 will be at the
lower end of its 10 percent to 15 percent target.  Output increases will return to about 15 percent next year
as it seeks to achieve 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day
by 2015, it said today in a statement in London. Profit slipped
7 percent in 2012 to $600 million.  Dragon has added assets in Iraq and Tunisia to diversify
from its main production base in Turkmenistan and plans to use
five drilling rigs this year, up from three in 2012. The company
raised its dividend to 30 cents a share from 20 cents in 2011
and it bought back $200 million in shares last year.  “We’re on target to meet our production growth potential
in 2015,” Chief Executive Officer  Abdul Jaleel Al Khalifa  said
in a phone interview. “Drilling is mostly focused on the
second-half of this year and there will be more in 2014, but
2013 still has a lot of potential.”  Shares rose 0.8 percent to 587 pence as of 8:16 a.m. in
London. The stock has gained 11 percent in the past year.  The company will continue to seek acquisitions in Africa
and Asia, Al Khalifa said, without naming specific countries.
Dividends will remain in the same range as 2012’s in the coming
years and may see some “modest growth,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
