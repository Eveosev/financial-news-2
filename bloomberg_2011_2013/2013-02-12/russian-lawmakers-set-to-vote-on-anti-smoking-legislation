Russian lawmakers are preparing for
their final vote today on anti-smoking legislation aimed at
reducing cigarette consumption in the world’s second-largest
tobacco market.  “A system is being shaped with the primary goal of not
promoting tobacco or anything that has to do with smoking,”
Deputy Speaker Sergei Zheleznyak said in Moscow before the
reading of the bill in Parliament, according to an e-mailed
statement.  The legislation bans public smoking from mid-2014 and
restricts tobacco sales and advertising. Initial measures
proposed by the Russian government would have outlawed all
tobacco advertising and sponsorship as well as kiosk sales
immediately, with bans on trade in small retail outlets and
smoking in public places taking effect on Jan. 1, 2015. The
amended bill allows tobacco makers to sponsor philanthropy and
sell cigarettes in all retail outlets except for kiosks.  Philip Morris International Inc. ,  British American Tobacco
Plc ,  Japan Tobacco Inc.  and  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc , which
control 93 percent of the $19.5 billion Russian market, had
opposed the curbs on cigarette consumption, which were backed by
Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  and approved on the first reading
on Dec. 14. The new version of the legislation is a compromise
after a “multi-million-dollar campaign” by the tobacco lobby,
according to lawmaker Dmitry Nosov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
