United Arab Emirates’ banks plan to
make recommendations to the central bank on replacing current
laws which treat bounced checks as a criminal offence, according
to the chairman of the Emirates Banks Association.  Other systems should be introduced to protect banks and
businesses,  Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair , who is also chief executive
officer  Mashreqbank PSC , told reporters in Dubai today. Emirates
Banks Association, which represents the country’s lenders, is
preparing a paper on the subject and will present it to the
government, he said.  The number of bounced checks and the value of bad loans in
the U.A.E., the second-biggest Arab economy, rose after
businesses were hit by the global credit crisis and companies
cut jobs, leading to a rise in the number of people arrested for
the offence. About 40 percent of the 1,200 people in Dubai
Central Prison have been convicted of defaulting on bank loans,
Human Rights Watch said in a report in January 2010.  The check system “today its serving us well and without a
holistic system in place it will be a catastrophe for
business,” Al Ghurair said. If you move away from checks as a
security “everybody will move to cash and the whole trade will
change from a semi-secure payment mode to cash,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
