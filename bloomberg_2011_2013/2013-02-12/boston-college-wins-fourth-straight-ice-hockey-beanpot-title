Boston College captured its fourth
straight Beanpot college ice hockey tournament title with a 6-3
victory over Northeastern University in Boston.  Johnny Gaudreau had two goals and an assist for Boston
College (17-7-2), which is ranked fourth in the USA Today/USA
Hockey Magazine poll. It’s the 18th Beanpot title for the Eagles
in the tournament’s 61-year history.  Kevin Roy scored twice for Northeastern (8-14-3), which was
denied its first Beanpot title since 1988.  Boston College, which beat Harvard University 4-1 in the
semifinals on Feb. 4, scored four second-period goals against
Northeastern last night to open a 4-1 lead. After the Huskies
pulled within 4-3 in the third period, Gaudreau scored with five
minutes, 23 seconds left to extend Boston College’s lead and Pat
Mullane added an insurance goal with 1:28 remaining.  Harvard beat Boston University 7-4 last night in the
consolation game at the Beanpot, the annual four-school
competition for college hockey bragging rights in Boston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
