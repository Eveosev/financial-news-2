North Korea must abandon its nuclear
program and restart talks with the international community after
conducting another nuclear test, Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  said.  The nation’s third nuclear test should not be used to
justify more military activity on the Korean Peninsula, Lavrov
told reporters today in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa.
The Korean Central News Agency reported that the underground
test “of a smaller and light A-bomb” was successful.  North Korea “should stop its nuclear missile program
because it is violating the non-proliferation treaty,” Lavrov
said. “I really hope that this step from Pyongyang won’t be
used as a pretext to expand military activity on the
peninsula.”  South Korea, the U.S., China and Japan condemned the test,
which came three weeks after the United Nations tightened
sanctions. The so-called six-nation talks involving those
nations and Russia to deal with tensions on the Korean peninsula
haven’t been held since December 2008.  North Korea has enough plutonium to produce six to 18
nuclear weapons, according to the Washington-based Institute for
Science and International Security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
