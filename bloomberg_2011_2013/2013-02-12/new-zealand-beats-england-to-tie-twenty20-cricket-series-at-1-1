New Zealand defeated England by 55
runs in Hamilton to even their three-match Twenty20 cricket
series.  England won the toss and put the hosts in to bat. New
Zealand sprinted out to 192-6 in its 20 overs, and then
restricted England to 137 all out in 19.3 overs. The visitors
started 9-2 with Alex Hales out for 5 and Luke Wright caught
without scoring.  New Zealand was led by Brendon McCullum’s 74. James
Franklin took 4-15 and Ian Butler took 2-9.  “We’re happy to bounce back from the other day,” McCullum
said in a televised interview. “We know England has room to
improve after the opening performance so we have to get
better.”  England won the opening match in the series last weekend by
40 runs in Auckland. The pair play in three days in Wellington
for the last match.  The teams then meet for three one-day internationals and
three Tests in New Zealand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
