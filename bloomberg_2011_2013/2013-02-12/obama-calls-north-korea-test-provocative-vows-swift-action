U.S. President  Barack Obama  called
North Korea’s nuclear test a threat to regional stability that
undermines United Nations Security Council resolutions and
warrants “swift and credible” action by the international
commmunity, according to a White House statement.  “North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile
programs constitute a threat to U.S. national security and to
international peace and security,” Obama said in the statement
released early today in Washington.  Vowing “firm action,” Obama said the U.S. would remain
vigilant in the “face of North Korean provocations” and stick
by its security commitments to allied nations in the region. The
president said the U.S. would continue to take the necessary
steps to defend itself and allies.  North Korea said it conducted the underground nuclear test
today, according to a statement from the state-run Korean
Central News Agency. The blast at 11:57 a.m. local time was
bigger than the country’s previous two tests, according to South
Korea’s national security adviser, Chun Yung Woo, who spoke in a
televised briefing from Seoul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
