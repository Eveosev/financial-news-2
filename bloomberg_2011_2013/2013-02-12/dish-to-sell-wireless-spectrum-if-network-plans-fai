Dish Network Corp.  will sell its
spectrum if current plans to find a partner to create a wireless
network don’t work, Chairman  Charles Ergen  said.  Dish has “billions of dollars of spectrum” that could
become available, Ergen said yesterday at a conference in Dana
Point, California hosted by AllThingsD.  The company is seeking to create a wireless network that
can deliver video, voice and data to its customers, Ergen said.
A network is essential to Dish’s plans to deliver video to its
satellite television subscribers both inside and outside the
home, he said. Dish is offering $3.30 a share for a minority
stake in wireless carrier  Clearwire Corp .  “We would admit we failed and try a new approach,” Ergen
said, if efforts to partner with a wireless company aren’t
effective. “We would hang a ‘for sale’ sign on the spectrum.”  Dish , based in Englewood, Colorado, rose 1.5 percent to
$37.66 in New York. The  stock  has climbed 3.5 percent this year,
trailing the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s 6.5 percent gain.  Dish’s offer is good for Clearwire’s shareholders, Ergen
said. Dish is competing with  Sprint Nextel Corp. , which  offered
$2.97 a share for the portion of the wireless company it  doesn’t
already own .  “It’s not an illusory offer,” Ergen said. “We’re serious
about it. Our offer is good for shareholders. Sprint will have
to do more to keep us out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
