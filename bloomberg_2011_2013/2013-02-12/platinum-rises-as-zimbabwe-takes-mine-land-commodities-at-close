The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  rose 0.1 percent to 679.87 by 6:17
p.m. in London. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices 
climbed 0.2 percent to 1,608.533.  PRECIOUS METALS  Platinum rose for a second straight day, widening its
premium to gold to a 17-month high, on concern supply may fall
after Zimbabwe seized land from the country’s top miner of the
metal. Gold slid.  Zimbabwe, the third-biggest platinum producer and fifth-
largest palladium miner in 2011, repossessed about 69,000 acres
of land from Zimplats Holdings Ltd. to offer to new investors,
Mines Minister Obert Mpofu said yesterday. One ounce of platinum
bought as much as 1.0515 ounces of gold in London today, the

signs of rising stockpiles at facilities monitored by ICE
Futures U.S. Cocoa and coffee also slid, while orange juice and

$2,164 a metric ton on ICE.  Also in New York, arabica-coffee futures for May delivery

percent to 18.21 cents a pound in New York.  CRUDE OIL  West Texas Intermediate oil in New York retreated after the

the highest level in 20 years.  Crude oil for March delivery fell 9 cents to $97.42 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures touched
$98.11 earlier, the highest level since Feb. 1.  OIL PRODUCTS  Ethanol weakened against gasoline as distillers sought to
capitalize on the best returns in eight months for turning a
bushel of corn into the biofuel.  The spread widened 1.92 cents to 68.25 cents a gallon in
New York a day after the corn crush spread, which shows the loss
from turning corn into ethanol, narrowed to 14 cents a gallon,
the least since June and up from a loss of 30 cents a month ago.
Distillers have reduced output and idled plants as earnings fell
below production costs.  Gasoline for March delivery climbed 0.66 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $3.0569 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
blended with ethanol.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline is the steepest since Sept.
28, when it traded at 99.8 cents below the motor fuel.  Corn for March delivery advanced 3 cents to $6.9925 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures climbed in New York for the second time
in three days on forecasts of a Midwest chill that would boost
demand for the heating fuel.  Natural gas for March delivery rose 8.5 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $3.315 per million British thermal units on the New

in Chicago and wheat traded at a seven-month low on speculation
rains in Brazil and the U.S. will help crop development.  Corn for delivery in March dropped 1 percent to $6.89 a

($312) a metric ton.  Soybeans for delivery in May dropped 1.1 percent to $13.945
a bushel in Chicago, set for a sixth straight retreat.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures declined for the second straight day on
speculation that higher prices for U.S. beef are slowing
consumer purchases of the meat. Hog prices were little changed.  Wholesale beef rose 0.1 percent to $1.8357 a pound as of
midday, a one-week high, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show.  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$1.28875 a pound  on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement declined 1.7
percent to $1.40825 a pound. A close at that price would be the
