A Dutch government bill to revamp
the country’s housing and mortgage market may not pass in its
current form after Housing Minister  Stef Blok  struggled to get a
majority of senators to support it.  “Talks with the Christian Democratic Party failed,” the
ministry said in a statement. The government is in talks with
political parties D66, the Christian Union and the SGP, it said.
Richard Gielen, a ministry spokesman, couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment.  The government plans to restrict tax deductions for
mortgages of 30 years or less, while renters with an income of
more than 43,000 euros ($58,000) may see their rates go up by as
much as 5 percent. The government is also seeking to impose
levies totaling 2 billion euros on housing corporations. The law
needs to be passed before March 1 if the higher rents are to
become effective July 1.  The housing plan is the first major test for Prime Minister
 Mark Rutte  in the Senate, where his People’s Party for Freedom
and Democracy lacks a majority. The Christian Democratic Party,
which could help deliver a majority, opposes the plan as being
too strict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
