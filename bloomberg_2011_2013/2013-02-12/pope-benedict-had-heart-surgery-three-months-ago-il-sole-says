Pope Benedict XVI had heart surgery
to replace his pacemaker three months ago at Rome’s Pio XI
clinic, Il Sole 24 Ore reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The surgery was performed by Luigi Chiariello, a
cardiologist who teaches at Rome’s Tor Vergata university and
who inserted the pope’s original pacemaker 10 years ago, the
newspaper said. Chiariello declined to comment on the matter, Il
Sole said.  The operation was a success and the pope maintained his
regular schedule, Il Sole said. A Vatican spokesman couldn’t
immediately be reached by phone for comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
