OAO Rosneft filed an appeal over the
withdrawal of a 100 billion ruble ($3.3 billion) claim against
BP Plc, according to a  posting  on the website of an arbitration
court in Omsk, Siberia.  BP has received notification of the appeal, Konstantin
Lukoyanov, a Moscow-based lawyer for the London-based company,
said today by phone.  The Omsk court last month approved a request by Andrey
Prokhorov, a minority shareholder in OAO TNK-BP Holding, to
withdraw his claim against BP. Prokhorov, who holds 0.00001
percent in the traded unit, sued BP for damages after it sought
a share swap and exploration alliance with Rosneft in 2011.  A spokeswoman for Rosneft declined to comment.  Rosneft is buying TNK-BP, Russiaâ€™s third-largest oil
producer, from BP and its billionaire partners for $55 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
