Overseas Shipholding Group Inc., the
New York-based tanker owner that sought  bankruptcy  protection in
November, named a new chief executive officer after  Morten Arntzen  quit the role he held for nine years.  Robert Johnston , head of the company’s U.S.-flag business,
will take over immediately, Overseas Shipholding said in a
statement yesterday. He will become the company’s president, a
role Arntzen also held before resigning.  Overseas Shipholding’s shares plunged 90 percent in the
past year to 99 cents amid the worst market for its
international crude oil carriers in more than a decade. The
company filed for protection from creditors on Nov. 14, three
weeks after saying it might do so because of a tax issue arising
from the fact it’s U.S. based with international operations. It
also said the three previous years’ results couldn’t be relied
upon.  The company is the largest U.S.-based owner of tankers
operating on international trade routes and has the biggest
fleet of Jones Act carriers, the only kind permitted to haul
fuel between the nation’s ports.  Arntzen became Overseas Shipholding’s CEO in January 2004
and guided the company through almost $2 billion in
acquisitions, according to the company’s website. Johnston was
named head of Overseas Shipholding’s U.S. flag unit in January
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
