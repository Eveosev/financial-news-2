Ahorro Corp., the Spanish investment
group owned by lenders including Bankia SA, plans to cut about a
third of its workforce after reporting a full-year loss,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Ahorro, which has 460 employees and has offices in Spain
and the U.S., could carry out the job cuts by April and present
a new business plan in May, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the deliberations are private.  The Madrid-based company will report a 2012 net loss of
about 160 million euros ($215 million), compared with profit of
4.5 million euros the previous year, the person said. The sale
of covered bonds and asset-backed securities resulted in net
capital losses of about 300 million euros, the person said.  Ahorro manages funds for private and institutional
investors, while offering equity and fixed-income brokerage
services, according to the company’s  website . Expansion
newspaper reported Ahorro’s restructuring plans and 2012 losses
earlier today.  Silvia Sagarna, a spokeswoman for Ahorro in Madrid,
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
