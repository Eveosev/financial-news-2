Rubber futures rallied from a one-
week low as Japan’s currency traded at the weakest in almost
three years, raising the appeal of yen-denominated contracts.  The contract for delivery in July gained 0.4 percent to end
at 331.6 yen a kilogram ($3,525 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. Futures recovered after dropping to 323.4
yen in after-hours trading on Feb. 8, the lowest level since Feb.
4. The most-active contract has gained 9.6 percent this year.  The yen climbed to 94.22 per dollar after  Haruhiko Kuroda ,
a potential contender for the Bank of Japan governor, said
yesterday monetary stimulus by the central bank could be
justified for 2013. U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Lael Brainard
said she supports efforts in Japan to end deflation and
reinvigorate growth.  “A weakening yen helps Japan’s auto industry boost sales
overseas, which is positive for rubber demand,” Takaki
Shigemoto, an analyst at JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Gains were limited after data showed rubber stockpiles in
China increased, raising speculation demand from the world’s
largest consumer may be slowing, Shigemoto said.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange is closed this week for
holidays. Natural-rubber inventories rose 1,201 tons to 100,015
tons, based on a survey of nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong,
Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the bourse said Feb. 8.  Japan’s new vehicle tire sales fell 10 percent on year to
3.69 million units in January, Japan Automobile Tyre
Manufacturers Association said today. That compared with an on-
year decline of 18 percent last month, it said.  Thai rubber free-on-board added 0.5 percent to 97.85 baht
($3.27) a kilogram today, according to the country’s Rubber
Research Institute.  To contact the reporters on this story:
