Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. , the owner of
Africa’s biggest mine producing the steelmaking raw material,
said full-year profit slumped 28 percent as costs climbed,
output decreased and prices declined.  Net income fell to 12.2 billion rand ($1.4 billion), from
17 billion rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based unit of
Anglo American Plc said today in a statement. The result
compares with the 12.4 billion-rand median of eight analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share excluding
one-time items slid to 37.97 rand, from 53.13 rand, after the
company a month ago projected a range of 36.30 to 38.80 rand.  Declining prices “had a negative effect on earnings” in
addition to lower output, said Chief Executive Officer  Norman Mbhazima  on a call after the results. Average iron-ore export
prices slid 23 percent to $122 a metric ton, the company said.  Kumba’s Sishen mine produced less ore in the fourth
quarter, primarily because of a labor strike followed by low
levels of employee attendance, it said on Jan. 25. Workers
returned to the mine and production resumed in December.  Output at Sishen dropped 13 percent to 33.7 million tons in
2012, Kumba said. An extra 10 million to 20 million tons of
mining waste will need to be extracted in 2013 because of lower
output during the strike, raising costs per ton of ore mined.  Kumba fell 0.7 percent to 606.79 rand by the 5 p.m. close
of trading in Johannesburg, paring a 7 percent gain so far this
year.  While the company is still looking for iron-ore projects in
West Africa, it has to be “very careful that what we find is
something that can give value to our shareholder,” Mbhazima
said. “It’s a difficult market at the moment.”  World crude-steel output this year is expected to grow at
“similar levels” to 2012, when it rose 2 percent, Kumba said.  Kumba had ore reserves of 1.1 billion tons at operations
including Sishen, Kolomela and Thabazimbi as of Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
