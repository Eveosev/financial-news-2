American Express Co . Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  Kenneth I. Chenault  netted $15.4 million
before taxes from the exercise of stock options and the sale of
restricted shares.  Chenault, 61, disposed of 519,137 shares on Feb. 8 at an
average of $61.85 apiece after exercising an option to buy the
shares for $43.98 each, for proceeds of $7.69 million, according
to a regulatory filing today from the New York-based company. He
reaped $7.7 million from additional share sales, the filing
shows. The CEO still owns 914,642 common shares, compared with
about 1 million before the transactions.  AmEx, the biggest U.S. credit-card issuer by customer
spending, said last month that it plans to eliminate about 5,400
jobs, with the heaviest cuts coming in the travel business, as
consumers and businesses rely more on digital technology for
bookings. The company said Jan. 17 that net income dropped 47
percent on costs tied to severance and changes in how the firm
estimates future redemptions of credit-card rewards.  The  options , which began vesting in 2005, were worthless
during the financial crisis as American Express shares plunged
from more than $50 a share in May 2008 to as low as $9.71 in
March 2009. The stock has surged 504 percent since then, closing
today at $61.98.  To contact the reporter on this story:
