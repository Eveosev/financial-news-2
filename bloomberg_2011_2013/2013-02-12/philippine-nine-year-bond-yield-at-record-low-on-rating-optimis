Philippine 10-year bonds rose,
pushing the yield to a five-month low, on optimism gains in
government revenue and exports boost the odds of the nation
winning an investment-grade rating. The peso was steady.  The Bureau of Customs collected 24.5 billion pesos ($602
million) in January, meeting its monthly target for the first
time since March 2011, BusinessWorld reported last night on its
website, citing Commissioner  Ruffy Biazon . Overseas  shipments 
climbed 16.5 percent in December, the biggest increase in three
months, an official report showed today.  “The positive news gave confidence to buyers,” said  Jan Briace Santos , a debt trader who helps manage the equivalent of
$18 billion at BPI Asset Management Inc. in Manila. “A recovery
in exports is good for the economy, and higher revenues will
help support the case for a rating upgrade.”  The yield on the 4.75 percent bonds due September 2022
dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.75
percent as of 4:46 p.m. in Manila, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services. That is the lowest level since the
notes were first sold in September 2012.  The Philippines has the highest junk rating at Moody’s
Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s. S&P
raised the nation’s credit outlook to positive in December and
said an upgrade is possible in 2013 on improved governance and
public finances.  The peso closed unchanged from yesterday at 40.69 per
dollar, data from Tullett Prebon Plc show. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, was steady at 4.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
