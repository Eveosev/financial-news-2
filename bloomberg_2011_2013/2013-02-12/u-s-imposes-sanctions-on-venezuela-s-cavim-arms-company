The U.S. imposed sanctions on a
state-owned Venezuelan weapons company after it traded with
Iran, North Korea or Syria, the State Department said in a
 statement  posted on its website.  The U.S. sanctioned the Venezuelan Military Industry
Company under the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation
Act, known as INKSNA. The sanctions, which the statement didn’t
detail, expire in February, 2015. The U.S. also penalized
companies or individuals in Belarus, China, Iran, Sudan and
Syria, according to the statement.  “There was credible information indicating they had
transferred to, or acquired from, Iran, North Korea, or Syria,
equipment and technology,” the State Department said yesterday.  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez , who is receiving
treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer in Cuba, has angered
the U.S. by building close ties with Iran and Syria. Chavez has
visited Iran nine times during his 14 years in power and signed
more than 100 accords with Iran for everything from a Venezuelan
campaign to build low-income homes to a joint venture to
manufacture bicycles.  The U.S. imposed sanctions on Petroleos de Venezuela SA,
the state oil company, in 2011 for working with Iran’s energy
industry. According to the State Department, PDVSA, as the
company is known, sent two cargoes of gasoline additives worth
$50 million to Iran from December 2010 to March 2011.  No one was immediately available at the Venezuelan Military
Industry Co. when called today by Bloomberg seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
