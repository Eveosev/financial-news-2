The U.S. Energy Department  increased
its crude-oil price and global demand projections for 2013.  West Texas Intermediate oil will average  $92.81 a barrel 
this year, up 3.7 percent from the January projection of $89.54,
the Energy Information Administration, the department’s
statistics arm, said today in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook. The U.S. benchmark grade will average $92.17 in 2014,
up from the previous month’s estimate of $91.  Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half the world’s
crude, will average $109.33 a barrel in 2013, up 4 percent from
last month’s forecast of $105.17. Brent will slip to $100.75
next year, according to the report.  The spread between Brent and WTI, which will average $16.52
a barrel this year, will narrow to $8.58 in 2014.  The average cost of domestic and imported grades used by
U.S. refiners will be $97.50 a barrel in 2013, up 3.4 percent
from the January projection of $94.27.  The department  increased its forecast  for global oil
consumption this year to 90.21 million barrels a day from 90.11
million estimated last month. Demand will be 1.2 percent higher
than last year’s average of 89.16 million. Global consumption
will climb to 91.62 million in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
