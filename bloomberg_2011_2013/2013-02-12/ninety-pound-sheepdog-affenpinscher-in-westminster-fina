The succession race riveting dogdom stars a stately American Foxhound, a peripatetic Affenpinscher, a docile Bichon Frise and a 90 pound (40 kilogram) Old English Sheepdog.  Tonight they face winners of the sporting, working and terrier groups in the  Westminster Kennel Club  dog show at New York’s Madison Square Garden. A Pekingese named Malachy was 2012’s best in show.  Slideshow:  Barking Their Way to the Top “It’s like the Olympic Games of the dogs,” said Manos Tsagarakis, of Ashland, Massachusetts, after his teenage daughter, Artemis, showed her 15-inch (38 centimeters) beagle to a fourth place finish in the breed yesterday.  The top specimens of the hound, toy, non-sporting and herding groups were decided last night. The best in show is named just before 11 p.m. Eastern time.  Muse highlights include  Mark Beech  on music and  James Russell  on architecture.  To contact the reporter of this story:  Philip Boroff  in New York at  pboroff@bloomberg.net .
