Belize’s government proposed
extending maturities and cutting the coupon on the country’s
$544 million of defaulted debt as part of the Central American
nation’s second debt restructuring since 2007.  Prime Minister  Dean Barrow’s  plan would extend the maturity
on the defaulted bonds to 2038 from 2029 and lower the current
coupon to 5 percent from 8.5 percent. Barrow, speaking to the
lower house in Belmopan, said the agreement would provide the
country $247 million in relief over the next 10 years.  “There is no reason to fear that with this massive package
of debt relief, there can be any chance of Belize defaulting
again,” Barrow said.  Belize missed a $23 million coupon payment on its bonds in
August. It later paid half the amount as talks with creditors
continued.  The House of Representatives will vote on the terms of the
agreement today, followed by a Senate vote tomorrow, Barrow
said.  The price on Belize’s 2029 debt fell 2.4 cents to 57.14
cents on the dollar at 1:19 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
