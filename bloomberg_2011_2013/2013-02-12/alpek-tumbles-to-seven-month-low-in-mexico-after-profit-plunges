Alpek SAB , the publicly traded
petrochemical unit of Mexican holding company  Alfa SAB , fell to
a seven-month low after profit plunged 60 percent in the fourth
quarter and the company forecast declining sales in 2013.  Alpek sank 3.8 percent to 28.22 pesos at the close of
trading in Mexico City. Alfa fell 4.8 percent.  The San Pedro Garza Garcia-based petrochemical maker cited
“challenging dynamics” for exports as it forecast a 4 percent
decline in revenue this year and an 11 percent drop in earnings
before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation, a measure
of profit known as Ebitda. Alpek got 65 percent of its sales
from abroad in the third quarter, according to the most recent
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fernando Bolanos, an analyst with Monex Casa de Bolsa SA in
Mexico City, cut his price target on the shares by 19 percent to
34 pesos. Bolanos said in a note to clients that the company’s
sales would probably fall 4.8 percent this year while Ebitda
would tumble 13 percent. He previously forecast 7.5 percent
sales growth and 6.3 percent Ebitda growth.  Alpek’s profit declined to $30 million in the final three
months of 2012 and revenue fell 2.9 percent to $1.67 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
