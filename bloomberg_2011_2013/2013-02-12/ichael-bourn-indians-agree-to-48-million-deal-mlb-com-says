All-Star outfielder  Michael Bourn 
agreed to a four-year, $48 million contract with the Cleveland
Indians,  MLB.com reported , citing an unidentified person
familiar with the situation.  Bourn, 30, was one of Major League Baseball’s top free
agents this offseason, with pursuers that included the New York
Mets. In 155 games for the Atlanta Braves last season, Bourn
hit .274 with nine home runs, 57 runs batted in, 96 runs scored
and 42 stolen bases in 55 attempts.  A two-time All-Star who’s won two Gold Glove awards for his
defense, Bourn has a career .272 batting average with 276 steals
over seven major league seasons. He had 61 stolen bases in both
the 2009 and 2011 seasons.  Because the Braves made a qualifying offer for Bourn, the
Indians were also forced to give up a draft pick, the 69th
overall, MLB.com said. Cleveland had previously given up a
second-round selection, the 42nd overall choice, as compensation
for signing former New York Yankees outfielder  Nick Swisher  as a
free agent. The Indians’ first-round pick, No. 5 overall, is
protected by the league’s labor agreement.  The Mets were interested in Bourn if the league would have
allowed them to keep the 11th overall pick, MLB.com said. While
only the top 10 picks are protected by the collective bargaining
agreement, the Mets would have had the 10th pick, yet were
bumped to No. 11 when the Pittsburgh Pirates were given a
compensatory pick in the top 10 this year for failing to sign
their first-round selection from 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
