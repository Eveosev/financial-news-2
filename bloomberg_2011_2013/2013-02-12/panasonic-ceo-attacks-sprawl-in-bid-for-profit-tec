In its 95-year history,  Panasonic Corp.  has grown into a consumer-electronics giant producing everything from TVs to eyelash curlers. New President  Kazuhiro Tsuga  is deciding what it can’t afford to make any more.  Next month, the  head  of the company that  lost  more than 1.3 trillion yen ($14.1 billion) since April 2011 will explain which products he wants consigned to Panasonic’s past. He plans to cut the number of  business  units by a third to focus on those offering the best profit margins, such as little-known operations like beauty appliances and welding machinery, rather than relying on lower-margin products like TVs and cell phones.  Panasonic booked a profit for the months of October through December after cutting 13,000 jobs, while  Sony Corp.  reported another loss under President  Kazuo Hirai , also appointed last year. Having slid to the lowest levels since the mid-1970s last November, Panasonic’s  stock  rebounded to the highest price since April last year. Still, among the 20  analysts  covering the company tracked by Bloomberg, 35 percent rate it buy, down from just below 50 percent when Tsuga took office in June.  After 33 years working in divisions across Panasonic, Tsuga may have the experience to deliver the kind of turnaround needed at Panasonic, a  company  that still expects to post a net loss of 765 billion yen this fiscal year and hasn’t generated  free cash flow  for eight quarters, said  Fumiaki Sato , co-founder of Tokyo- based turnaround advisory firm Sangyo Sosei Advisory Inc.  “Tsuga-san’s advantage may be that he has broad understanding of electronics businesses and experiences in Panasonic’s various divisions,” said Sato.  Smart Home  If the company is to bolster its prospects, Sato and others say it needs to focus on business-to-business operations and high-margin home appliances that distinguish it from  Sony , which sank to its eighth consecutive quarterly net loss in October- December amid sliding demand for its TVs.  Panasonic’s avionics and energy businesses offer examples of the kind of specialist products it can sell to corporate customers that can offer higher  margins  than mainstream consumer goods: in-flight entertainment systems for jets and energy- management systems for homes.  “Tsuga is trying to focus more on business-use products and smart-home products because that is the only way to go,” Sato said. “ Panasonic  has fuel-cell operations and other units enabling it to pursue a smart-home strategy. That is something Sony cannot do,” Sato said, referring to Sony’s focus of seeking to make big-volume hits out of consumer products like the PlayStation.  Sony has organized a PlayStation event for Feb. 20, stoking speculation it will announce the introduction of the fourth generation of its video-game console.  Surprise Profit  Tsuga’s challenge comes with Japan’s broader technology industry in torpor.  Sony  and  Sharp Corp.  have seen losses pile up in recent years as their TVs, mobile phones and personal computers were eclipsed by hits from Apple Inc. and  Samsung Electronics Co. , just as the strong yen made Japanese exports even less competitive overseas.  Stock prices across the sector have tracked the  Nikkei 225  higher in the past three months in response to the weakening of the yen versus the dollar.  Panasonic  got a further boost this month from the surprise October-December profit, leading investors to push the shares to their biggest one-day gain in almost 40 years.  Market Value  Panasonic fell 3.4 percent to 677 yen in Tokyo trading today, trimming  gains this year  to 30 percent. Sony dropped 5.6 percent, partly because the yen stopped declining against the euro, said  Hideki Yasuda , an Ace Securities Co. analyst in Tokyo.  Panasonic’s  stock  remains anemic compared to its recent history. At current levels,  like Sony , the company is worth less than a third of its  market value  at the end of June 2008, before shares sank around the globe in the financial crisis. Over the same period, the Nikkei index has dropped 16 percent,  Apple  shares have almost tripled in value, and Samsung Electronics stock has more than doubled.  Complicating matters for Tsuga is fallout from the acquisition of Osaka peer Sanyo Electric Co., completed in 2011. The deal, Panasonic’s biggest-ever  buy  at 936 billion yen, was designed to consolidate Panasonic’s position in businesses including rechargeable batteries and solar panels. Competition in those industries intensified significantly, prompting Panasonic to write down part of the cost of the deal.  Tsuga, 56, was picked to lead the  company  after a career that spanned its DVD and automotive electronics businesses, culminating in a spell heading up its TV operation. Six months after taking charge of the TV operation, he suspended operations at three factories, almost halving production capacity and using more panels from overseas companies for TV sets.  Restructuring Costs  Booking 265 billion yen in restructuring charges,  Panasonic  said the change would improve earnings at the TV unit by 81 billion yen in the fiscal year ending in March.  Panasonic  doesn’t disclose losses from its TV operations, said Chieko Gyobu, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman.  Tsuga’s record at Panasonic’s TV unit has raised speculation that he may be able to move quickly to achieve the same thing on a bigger scale.  “ Panasonic  should go faster,”  Tetsuro Ii , president of Commons Asset Management Inc. in Tokyo, said in a telephone interview. “Significant structural reforms haven’t occurred yet. The company should accelerate sales of unprofitable assets and divisions.”  Junk Rating  Panasonic  debt  is rated junk by Fitch Ratings. The company has 180 billion yen in  bonds  that reach maturity this year.  Last October, Tsuga said he wanted to restructure  Panasonic  around four basic divisions, down from nine, with no more than 56 business units in total, down from 88.  That current disparate structure is a result of decades of investment in following new consumer product trends: From electric rice cookers in the 1950s, to VHS video recorders in the 1970s and notebook personal computers in the 1990s, Panasonic invested in covering trends set by others.  In his restructuring plan, Tsuga also said the maker of Viera TVs and Lumix cameras may consider pulling out of businesses with operating margins below 5 percent. Data reported by  Panasonic  on Feb. 1 showed that, among its main divisions, only the appliances business had an operating margin of more than 5 percent in the first nine months of the company’s current fiscal year.  Tsuga’s route to the top of  Panasonic  differs from Hirai’s path to Sony’s president. Born and raised in Osaka, Tsuga has a slew of patents to his credit after earning a degree in bioengineering from Osaka University and a master’s degree in computer science from the University of California at Santa Barbara.  ‘Miserable’ Rehearsal  Hirai, 52, was raised in the U.S. and Japan, and started in  Sony ’s music business before making his name as the head of its gaming unit, home of the PlayStation console.  Tsuga has been relaxed during public engagements at events like last month’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, even poking fun at himself. In a televised  interview  on  Panasonic ’s Ustream channel, he described the first rehearsal for his CES address at home as “miserable,” and said his wife criticized his English for “not sounding like English at all.”  In a separate interview about the October IFA trade show in Berlin, Tsuga talked of his intention to transform Panasonic’s TV business and public perceptions about his company.  “In the U.S., maybe we are just treated as a TV maker, but we are not,” he said. “The TV was invented as a receiving device. But now it’s a display in the home. We must think, ‘How can we utilize it as part of a residential space?’”  Founder Inspiration  Those who have worked with Tsuga, like  Brendan Traw  of  Intel Corp. , describe him as a leader who’s open to new ideas and frank discussion.  Panasonic  is among Intel’s biggest customers, according to estimates by Bloomberg, accounting for 2.4 percent of the chipmaker’s  annual revenue .  Traw was previously chief technology officer for Intel’s digital home business. He and Tsuga held “hundreds of hours of meetings” in Los Angeles as they “worked on overdrive” to convince Hollywood executives that DVDs could fight piracy and generate new revenue streams.  Traw started working with Tsuga in the late 1990s, and their collaboration continued about a year ago during the development of a 20-inch tablet computer showcased at CES.  “Change is inevitable in technology, and the pace at which people, companies and the industry need to change is increasing,” said Traw, one of a group of executives named by  Intel  as Fellows for technical prowess. “Tsuga-san is an agent of that kind of change.”  Tsuga also seeks to draw lessons from the company’s most famous leader: founder  Konosuke Matsushita . Tsuga is among a steady stream of Panasonic executives visiting exhibits at the Osaka  museum  dedicated to the industrialist, Assistant Director Yukitoshi Onda said. Employees seek inspiration from the  story  of the man who started the business at 23 making electrical plugs and sockets with his wife and brother.  “If I could see the founder,” Tsuga wrote in an article for the November edition of Japanese magazine Bungeishunju, “I’d wish to ask him whether he wanted  Panasonic  to become as enormous as the company is today,” adding: “I wonder how he’d start reform if he was in my position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Mariko Yasu  in Tokyo at  myasu@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Tighe in Hong Kong at  mtighe4@bloomberg.net
