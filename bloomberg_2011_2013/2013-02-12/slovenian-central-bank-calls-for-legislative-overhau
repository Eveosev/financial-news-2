Slovenian insolvency legislation is
burdening the economy and deepening the bank industry’s woes by
slowing the restructuring of companies, the central bank said.  The government needs to change the laws because owners are
allowed to drag the process out even though they are highly
indebted, Banka Slovenije, led by Governor  Marko Kranjec , said
in an e-mailed statement today.  “We can see problems in companies in an important segment
of the economy,” the bank said. “The inability of owners to
boost capital at troubled companies is causing an unnecessary
wave of bankruptcies, which in turn affects business at banks.”  Slovenian banks, including the largest Nova Ljubljanska
Banka d.d., will probably report a fourth consecutive year of
losses for 2012 as more and more companies go bankrupt and banks
pile up bad loans. The Adriatic nation, which was plunged into a
political crisis over corruption allegations against Prime
Minister  Janez Jansa , may be forced to seek aid from the
European Stability Mechanism, German weekly Wirtschaftswoche
said Feb. 8 citing an unnamed European Union official.  The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other
institutions support legislative changes since “quick
settlements can produce positive consequences relatively
quickly” after they are adopted, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
