West Texas Sour oil strengthened
against the benchmark West Texas Intermediate to the smallest
discount since Oct. 11 as operators of the Seaway Pipeline
reported a pinhole leak to regulators.  Enterprise Product Partners LP reported that crude oil
spilled from a “pinhole leak” in the Seaway pipeline at
Colbert Station in Bryan, Oklahoma. Western Refining Inc.’s El
Paso, Texas, refinery and Alon USA Energy Inc.’s Big Spring,
Texas, plant were undergoing maintenance.  Demand for West Texas Sour has gained because “Seaway is
unreliable at this point,” said Carl Larry, president of
Houston-based Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC. “More people are
looking to find not cheap crude, but something that’s viable
that they can use while this gets resolved. As they’re heading
into maintenance, they’re looking to manage their margins as
best they can.”  West Texas Sour  oil strengthened by 75 cents to a $3.50
discount to WTI at 12:20 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  WTI Midland  narrowed its discount by 5
cents to 90 cents.  Crudes produced in the Gulf of Mexico weakened as WTI
strengthened against Brent, the global oil benchmark. Offshore
domestic crudes tend to weaken along with Brent, which is used
to price competing overseas imports.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI narrowed $1.35 to
$20.55 a barrel, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium fell 75
cents to $20.50.  Mars Blend ’s premium fell 85 cents to $14.70. Thunder
Horse, a sour crude with lower sulfur content than Mars,
weakened 25 cents to a premium of $18.50. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium slipped by 75 cents to $13.75.  Western Canada Select , a blend of oil-sands bitumen,
strengthened $1.15 against WTI to a $23.85 discount, according
to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc.  Syncrude, a synthetic light, sweet oil upgraded from
bitumen, strengthened by $1 a barrel to a $2.50 premium to WTI,
Net Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
