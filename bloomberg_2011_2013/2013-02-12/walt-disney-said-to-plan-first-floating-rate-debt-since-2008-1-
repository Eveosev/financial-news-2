Walt Disney Co. , the world’s largest
entertainment company, raised $800 million with its first sale
of floating-rate debt in almost five years. The company
initially planned an offering of $500 million.  Disney sold two-year notes that yield one basis point less
than the three-month London interbank offered rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities are rated A2 by
Moody’s Investors Service and A at Standard & Poor’s, the data
show.  Three-month, dollar-denominated Libor, which was fixed
today at 0.29 percent, is the rate at which banks say they can
borrow from each other.  Disney last sold floaters in April 2008, issuing 9.5
billion yen ($93.3 million) of three-year debentures that have
since matured, according to Bloomberg data.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and
Royal Bank of Canada managed the offering for the Burbank,
California-based company, Bloomberg data show.  The company last sold debt in November, raising $3 billion
in a four-part offering, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
