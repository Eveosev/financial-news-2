Norske Skogindustrier ASA, Europe’s
third-largest maker of newsprint, was downgraded by Standard &
Poor’s to “selective default” as the company has repurchased
its debt at a deep discount.  Norske Skog was downgraded from CCC+/C after it continued
to repurchase bonds at an average discount of about 30 percent,
the ratings company said today in a statement. It kept a CCC+
rating on Norske Skog’s 2033 bonds, which weren’t included in
the buybacks, S&P said.  “By reacquiring its bonds at a large discount, Norske Skog
in our view paid investors participating in the transactions
less than originally promised,” Gustav Liedgren, an analyst at
Standard & Poor’s, said in the statement. “We consider the
cumulative effect of the transactions to be tantamount to a debt
restructuring.”  Norske Skog is trimming debt as it seeks to cut a 6 billion
kroner ($1.09 billion) net interest-bearing debt burden amid
excess supply in the newsprint market and competition from
online media.  The yield on the company’s 7 percent 2017 senior unsecured
bond was little changed at 19.02 percent as of 1:23 p.m. in
Oslo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
