Treasuries were little changed
before the government sells $32 billion of three-year notes, the
first of three auctions of coupon-bearing debt this week
totaling $72 billion.  Ten-year yields  earlier today as the U.S. will sell $24
billion of the securities tomorrow and $16 billion in 30-year
bonds on Feb. 14. The Federal Reserve purchased $3.3 billion of
securities maturing between February 2020 and November 2022
today as part of its plan to bolster the economy.  “People are kind of sitting there, frozen,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group
LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. “Everybody thinks rates are bound
to go up at some point; it’s not come about yet. People are
inclined to stay neutral until they get a better sense of the
big direction.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield was little changed at 1.96
percent as of 12:14 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent note due in November 2022
traded at 97. The yield climbed to 2.06 percent on Feb. 4, the
 highest  level since April 12.  Investor Sentiment  Investors in Treasuries raised bets to the highest level
since 2011 that the prices of the securities will drop. The
proportion of net shorts  was  at 19 percentage points in the week
ending yesterday, the most since July 5, 2011, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co., up from eight percentage points the week
ending Feb. 4.  The percent of outright shorts, or bets the securities will
fall in value, rose to 30 percent, the most since June 13, 2011,
from 21 percent the previous week, according to the survey. The
percent of outright longs dropped to 11 percent, from 13 percent
the previous week, the survey said. Investors cut neutral bets
to 59 percent from 66 percent, the survey reported.  Volatility in Treasuries dropped yesterday to 60 basis
points, close to the 59.9 basis points reached on Feb. 7, the
lowest level in two weeks, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE  index, which measures price swings based on
options.  The measure reached 51 basis points on Dec. 3, the lowest
level of price swings since the gauge begin in April 1988. It
hit a 2012 high of 95.4 basis points on June 15. Volatility
climbed to 264.6 basis points in October 2008 as the financial
crisis intensified.  Trade Levels  Treasury trading  volume  fell yesterday to $201 billion, the
lowest level since Jan. 7, according to ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt. Daily volume
averaged $240 billion in 2012  The three-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.42
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.385 percent at
the previous auction of the securities on Jan. 8. The record-low
auction yield was 0.327 percent in December.  Investors submitted orders to buy 3.62 times the amount of
available debt last month, versus 3.36 times in December. The
government is also scheduled to sell $24 billion of 10-year
notes tomorrow and $16 billion of 30-year bonds on Feb. 14.  “The auction today should come and go, but the market
doesn’t have a lot to spark it right now,” said  Scott Sherman ,
an interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New
York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade directly with the
Fed. “We’ve moved to a new range, and that is it”  Debt Returns  Treasury three-year notes have handed investors a loss of
0.02 percent this year, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. Ten-year notes declined 1.6 percent and 30-year
bonds slid 3.9 percent, based on the data.  Economists said a government report tomorrow will show U.S.
retail sales increased for a third month in January. U.S. retail
sales increased 0.1 percent last month after a 0.5 percent
advance in December, according to the  median forecast  of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before tomorrow’s Commerce
Department report.  President  Barack Obama  will deliver his State of the Union
address today as he attempts to persuade lawmakers and voters
that his plan to revive growth and bring down unemployment will
succeed.  “I’m going to be talking about making sure that we’re
focused on job creation here in the United States of America,”
he said last week to House Democrats at a meeting in Virginia.  The 10-year note will yield 1.97 percent at the end of June
and 2.24 percent by Dec. 31, according to the weighted average
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
