Mexico’s bonds rallied, pushing
yields down for a second day, on speculation that policy makers
tomorrow will give further signals that they’re prepared to
reduce benchmark borrowing costs.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point to 5.09 percent at 8:15 a.m. in Mexico
City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
0.45 centavo to 143.67 centavos per peso. Yields touched a
record low 5.06 percent on Feb. 6.  The central bank is scheduled tomorrow to give a quarterly
inflation report detailing price trends and updating forecasts.
The presentation will probably fuel speculation that policy
makers are ready to cut the benchmark rate from a record low 4.5
percent, said  Javier Belaunzaran , a money manager at Grupo
Financiero Interacciones SA.  “We’ll be watching the quarterly inflation report
tomorrow,” Belaunzaran said by phone from Mexico City.
“They’re probably going to say that they don’t see inflationary
risks.”  Mexico’s peso slipped 0.1 percent to 12.7503 per U.S.
dollar today, trimming its advance to 0.8 percent in 2013.  The monetary authority on Jan. 18 held borrowing costs for
a 32nd straight meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
