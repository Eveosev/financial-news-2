Abu Dhabi-based Al Jaber Group is in
the final stages of talks with creditors to restructure 16.5
billion dirhams ($4.5 billion) of debt, the National newspaper
reported, citing people familiar with the talks.  Liabilities of the holding company, which has interests in
construction, include between 7 billion dirhams and 7.5 billion
dirhams of bank loans and overdrafts, and 8 billion dirhams of
performance bonds and guarantees, the Abu Dhabi-based newspaper
said. The company, which has assets of 18 billion dirhams, will
sell 60 percent of its defense business, Al Jaber Land Systems,
to Abu Dhabi defense group Tawazun Holding, the newspaper said.  Al Jaber  declined to comment on the talks, according to a
spokesman who asked not to be named in line with company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
