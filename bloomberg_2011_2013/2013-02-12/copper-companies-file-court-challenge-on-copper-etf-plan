Encore Wire Corp. and Southwire Co.
asked a U.S. court to review a regulatory decision that cleared
the way for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. ’s planned exchange-traded fund
backed by copper.  The copper fabricators said that the order by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in December will “lead to an
investor-financed squeeze of the market” for copper, according
to a petition filed today with the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington. The companies will seek to have the SEC decision
vacated.  “This petition preserves the right to challenge the SEC
ruling, and sets the process in motion,” Robert Bernstein, a
lawyer at Eaton & Van Winkle LLP in New York, the firm
representing the copper companies, said today in a telephone
interview.  Industrial copper users including  Encore , based in
McKinney, Texas, and Southwire last month urged the SEC to
reverse its decision. The group has said that the JPM XF
Physical Copper Trust, the first U.S. exchange-traded fund
backed by physical metal, would leave less for manufacturers,
creating shortages and boosting prices.  The shares of Encore have climbed 23 percent in the past 12
months. Closely held Southwire is based in Carrollton, Georgia.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman at New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
