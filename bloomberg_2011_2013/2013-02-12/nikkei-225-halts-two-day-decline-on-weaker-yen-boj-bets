revenue in the Americas, rose 2.2 percent.  Softbank Corp.  rose

do from here because it has yet to start bold monetary easing,”
said  Koichi Kurose , chief economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank
Ltd., which oversees about 15 trillion yen ($160 billion). “I
think the Nikkei will climb to 12,000 in March or April.”  The Topix surged about 34 percent since elections were
announced on Nov. 14 amid optimism a new government will take
aggressive steps to weaken the yen and beat deflation. The
government will continue efforts to drive the Nikkei 225 to
13,000 by the end of March, said Economy Minister Akira Amari,
according to Kyodo News. The gauge is trading at 1.1 times  book

generation by stepping up stimulus and ending deflation,

down ahead of schedule on March 19.  The yen touched 94.46 against the dollar yesterday, the

earnings so far this quarter and for which Bloomberg has

percent missed sales projections, the data show.  Dentsu soared 10 percent to 2,838 yen, its highest close
since January 2008. The advertising firm’s nine-month net income
rose 50 percent from a year earlier to 19.9 billion yen.  Renesas Drops  Renesas Electronics Corp.  slumped 8.4 percent to 262 yen.

fell less than 0.1 percent yesterday after a six-week rally
pushed the gauge’s valuation up to the most expensive since July

third nuclear test today, underscoring a disregard for an
international community that has already isolated the
totalitarian state from the global economy.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index  added 2 percent
to 28.27, indicating traders expect a swing of about 8.1 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
