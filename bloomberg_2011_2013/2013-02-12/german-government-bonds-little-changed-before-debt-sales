Spanish and Italian bonds rallied as
the two nations sold a combined 14 billion euros ($18.8 billion)
of bills, allaying concern that political turmoil in both
countries would damp demand for their debt.  Spain’s  10-year yields  dropped the most in three weeks as
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said the government significantly
reduced its budget deficit last year. Italy’s 10-year yield fell
the most in a month. German bunds declined as demand for safer
assets waned. Spanish and Italian securities slid last week as
opposition leaders called for Rajoy to step down over
allegations of corruption and polls showed this month’s Italian
election may result a hung parliament.  “The risky issues have dissipated a bit in Italy and
Spain,” said  Piet Lammens , head of research at KBC Bank NV in
Brussels. “Even if there’s an election result in Italy that’s
not the best for markets, we don’t expect it to become a new
source of crisis. If there are selloffs, probably there will be
investors ready to jump in and buy these assets.”  Spain’s 10-year yield declined 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 5.33 percent at 4:42 p.m. London time after
dropping as much as 13 basis points, the most since Jan. 22. The
5.4 percent bond due in January 2023 climbed 0.75, or 7.50 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.555.  The  Italian 10-year yield  declined 12 basis points to 4.51
percent after falling as much as 14 basis points, the biggest
drop since Jan. 10.  Budget Figures  Spanish budget figures in coming weeks will show how close
Rajoy’s five rounds of spending cuts and tax increases got the
shortfall to a target set at 6.3 percent of output for 2012 by
euro-area finance ministers in July.  “Public deficit data for 2012 to be published in the
coming weeks will show unprecedented fiscal consolidation
efforts have been made,” Rajoy told reporters in Madrid. The
budget cuts are of “extraordinary merit” in times of recession
have removed doubts about the sustainability of Spanish public
finances, he said.  Spain sold 5.57 billion euros of six- and 12-month bills,
exceeding the upper goal of 5.5 billion euros. The Treasury sold
the six-month debt at an average yield of 0.859 percent, versus
0.888 percent on Jan. 22. The 12-month securities were auctioned
at 1.548 percent, compared with 1.472 percent on Jan. 15.  Italy sold 365-day bills at 1.094 percent, up from 0.864
percent on Jan. 10. The Rome-based Treasury is scheduled to sell
bonds maturing between 2015 and 2040 tomorrow.  Italy Polls  Final polls taken last week before Italy’s Feb. 24-25
elections show former premier  Silvio Berlusconi  was narrowing
the lead of front-runner  Pier Luigi Bersani .  “Just before the elections, we’d look for a rebound” in
Italian bonds, Societe Generale SA strategists  Ciaran O’Hagan 
and  Vincent Chaigneau  in Paris wrote today in a note to clients.
“Just about everybody has a pessimistic view of the outcome,
investors are positioned for a poor result, and we still just
might see a functioning reformist government.”  German  two-year notes  fell for a third day before the
nation auctions 5 billion euros of the securities tomorrow.  The notes to be sold will carry a coupon of 0.25 percent,
the first positive interest rate since April, the Bundesbank
said in a statement today.  The German two-year yield climbed one basis point to 0.19
percent after falling to 0.16 percent on Feb. 8, the lowest
level since Jan. 24. The  10-year yield  rose three basis points
to 1.64 percent.  Dutch Sale  The Netherlands sold 2.685 billion euros of notes maturing
in 2018 at an average yield of 0.884 percent, versus a record-
low 0.861 percent on Oct. 9. Dutch five-year securities rose
four basis points to 0.79 percent.  Volatility on Italian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Finland and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year or similar-maturity debt, the yield
spread between two-year and 10-year securities, and credit-
default swaps.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.4 percent this
year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish debt returned 1 percent and Italian
securities were little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
