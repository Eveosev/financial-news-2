Citigroup Inc . Chief Financial
Officer  John Gerspach  said the lender’s securities unit did well
in January and that activity in trading and banking businesses
looks similar to how last year began.  “January was a pretty good month and so the year got off
to a pretty  good start ,” Gerspach said today at an investor
conference in Miami hosted by Credit Suisse Group AG. “I
wouldn’t rate the year as 2009. January 2009 is still in the
record books.”  Citigroup is expanding in areas where it’s smaller than
competitors, including in prime brokerage, equity derivatives
and investment banking, Gerspach said. In banking, the company
made investments in 2010 and 2011 and “built up momentum” last
year, he said.  “There is still some work we need to do” in equity
derivatives, Gerspach said. His New York-based firm ranks third
by assets among U.S. lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
