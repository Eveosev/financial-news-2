Kenya’s shilling gained for the
third day, the longest winning streak in three months, on
subdued dollar demand and as the central bank continued to
remove money from the market.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.3 percent to 87.15 per dollar and was trading less
than 0.1 percent stronger at 87.32 by 12:50 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital.  “The shilling has recovered over the dollar on reduced
activity in the market and the continued support its getting
from the central bank,”  Jeremiah Kendagor , head of trading at
Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said today.  The Central Bank of Kenya offered 4 billion shillings ($46
million) of seven-day repurchase agreements, an official, who
asked not to be identified in line with policy, said by phone
from Nairobi. The bank which uses the repos to reduce total
money supply and support the shilling, has removed a total of
110 billion shillings this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Uganda’s currency was unchanged at 2,650 per dollar, while
the Tanzanian shilling was also unchanged, trading at 1,616 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
