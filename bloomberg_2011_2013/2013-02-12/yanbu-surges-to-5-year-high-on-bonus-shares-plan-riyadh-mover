Yanbu Cement Co.  surged to the
highest level in more than five years after the Saudi Arabian
maker of the building material said it is seeking approval for a
50 percent capital increase through bonus shares.  The stock advanced 4 percent to 90.75 riyals, the highest
level since January 2008, at the close in Riyadh. About 1.2
million shares were traded, more than 16 times the three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yanbu
Cement was the  fourth-biggest gainer  by percentage points on the
benchmark  Tadawul All Share Index,  which increased 0.4 percent.  “The announcement is a huge incentive for shareholders,”
said  Mohammed al-Omran , a financial analyst and president of the
Gulf Center for Financial Consultancy in Riyadh. “The outlook
for the company in particular and the cement industry overall is
positive. There is huge demand for cement in residential,
commercial or even governmental sectors” given the kingdom’s
spending plans, he said.  Yanbu Cement’s  full-year profit  surged 36 percent to 720
million riyals ($192 million), beating the  average estimate  of
five analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The company has a  12-month
dividend yield  of 2.8 percent, compared with 2.4 percent for
 Najran Cement Co . Saudi cement companies have benefited from
more than $500 billion in government spending on projects
including infrastructure. The  All Share Cement Index  has gained
each year since 2009, including an advance of 14 percent in
2012.  Yanbu Cement’s output of the material in January rose 42
percent from a year earlier, according to Yamama Saudi Cement
Ltd. data compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s shares gained 15
percent in 2012, compared with an advance of 6 percent for the
Tadawul.  To contact the reporters on this story:
