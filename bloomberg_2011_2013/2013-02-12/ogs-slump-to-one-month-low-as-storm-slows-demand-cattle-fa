Hog futures declined to a one-month
low on speculation that winter storms are slowing U.S. consumer
demand as shoppers stay indoors. Cattle also fell.  There will be a as much as 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of
snow in New York City and parts of southern New England
tomorrow, after a blizzard that struck the region starting Feb.
8. Last week’s storm dropped 24.9 inches on Boston, the fifth-
most on record, and 40 inches on Hamden, Connecticut, according
to the National Weather Service. About 613,000 customers from
Maine to New York were without power and travel was crippled.  “The Northeast retail business basically came to a
standstill,”  Lawrence Kane , a market adviser at Stewart-
Peterson Group in in Yates City, Illinois, said in a telephone
interview. “It’s a real tough situation for demand as far as
meat is concerned.”  Hog futures for April settlement fell 0.8 percent to 85.7
cents a pound at 11:53 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
after reaching 85.5 cents, the lowest for the most-active
contract since Jan. 10.  Wholesale  pork  dropped 5.9 percent to 81.69 cents a pound
last week, the biggest slide since September 2011, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  Cattle futures for April delivery slumped 1.5 percent to
$1.284 a pound on the CME. Prices are down 1.5 percent this year
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement fell by the
exchange limit of 3 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $1.418 a pound,
