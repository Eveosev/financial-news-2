U.S. nuclear-power generation fell
in the Southeast by the most since Dec. 16, 2011, as three
reactors were shut down.  Nationwide production declined 2.1 percent to 87,756
megawatts, or 86 percent of capacity, the lowest level since
Dec. 4, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 4.9 percent lower than  a year
ago , with 14 of 104 reactors offline.  Southern Co.  shut the 883-megawatt Hatch 2 plant after the
unit operated at full power yesterday. The plant went down for
scheduled refueling and maintenance, Mark Sullivan, a company
spokesman based in Birmingham, said in an e-mail.  Hatch 1  remained closed after a manual shutdown Feb. 10 due
to a water leak in the condenser, which cools steam after it
passes through the turbine. The units, about 20 miles (32
kilometers) south of Vidalia, Georgia, can produce a combined
1,759 megawatts.  The  Tennessee Valley Authority ’s Browns Ferry 3, a 1,115-
megawatt unit 32 miles west of Huntsville, Alabama, was shut
yesterday for maintenance on the condenser cooling water.
Groundwater from rain damaged the system, Mike Bradley, a
company spokesman, said in a telephone interview.  The unit will return to the grid before  Browns Ferry 2  is
shut in mid-March for a 45-day refueling outage, said Bradley,
based in Knoxville, Tennessee.  Turkey Point  NextEra Energy Inc. ’s Turkey Point 3, a 720-megawatt
reactor, tripped offline late yesterday after “a loss of
condenser vacuum,” a filing with the commission showed. The
plant is about 20 miles south of Miami.  The shutdowns pushed output in the  Southeast  down 1,938
megawatts, or 6.9 percent, the fourth straight decline. The
region has six of the nation’s 14 shut reactors, and output was
the lowest for the date in records going back to 1997.  Turkey Point 4 remains down for a four-month refueling and
maintenance project, which began Nov. 5.  Duke Energy Corp.  said
Feb. 5 that it will permanently shut its Crystal River 3 reactor
in Florida, which has been closed since 2009.  In the Northeast,  Entergy Corp. ’s 685-megawatt Pilgrim 1
reactor remained shut today after losing outside power during a
blizzard. While off-site power was restored, the plant will stay
closed for repairs to a safety relief valve, the NRC said.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 46 days in
2012, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
