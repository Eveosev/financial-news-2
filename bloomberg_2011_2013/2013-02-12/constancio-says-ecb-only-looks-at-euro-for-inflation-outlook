European Central Bank Vice President
 Vitor Constancio  said the bank only takes the euro’s exchange
rate into account when assessing the outlook for inflation.  “The only consideration that we do about the exchange rate
is to see what is the effect it has on the prospects for future
inflation, that’s the only consideration,” Constancio told
reporters in Helsinki today. “The euro is a floating currency
and we respect both the G-7 and G-20 principles” that a
“floating currency should be left to the market and this means
that the exchange rate as such for floating currencies should
not be a target of policies,” he said.  Constancio also said that while “there is no currency war
going on,” such an event “has to be avoided.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
