European coal for 2014 was little
changed.  Glencore International Plc , the worldâ€™s largest
publicly traded commodities supplier, said it more than doubled
production of the fuel last year.  Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp rose 10 cents to $100.60 a metric ton at 1:50 p.m. in
London, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contract earlier gained as much as 0.3 percent.  Output of the fuel used in power plant stations rose to
41.8 million metric tons in 2012 from 20.5 million tons, after
acquisitions in South Africa, Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore
said today in a statement. Xstrata Plc, the Swiss mining company
Glencore is seeking to buy for $36 billion, boosted coal
production 7 percent last year to 90.4 million tons, it said in
a separate statement.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
Marex Spectron Group Ltd., Credit Suisse Group AG, IHS
McCloskey, Tradition Financial Services and Tullett Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
