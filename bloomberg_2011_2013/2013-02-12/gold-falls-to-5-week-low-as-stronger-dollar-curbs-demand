Platinum advanced, ending a three-
session drop, as Zimbabwe said it took land from the country’s
biggest miner of the metal, fueling supply concerns. Palladium
reached the highest since September 2011. Gold rose.  The southern African nation’s government has repossessed
27,948 hectares (69,061 acres) of land from  Zimplats Holdings
Ltd.  and will offer it to new investors, Mines Minister Obert
Mpofu said today. One ounce of  platinum  bought as many as 1.0408
ounces of gold in London today, near the 17-month high of 1.0418
reached on Feb. 7, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Ordinarily, the gold-platinum spread at these levels
might be telling us that the economy was picking up, but most of
the pickup in platinum prices reflects supply concerns in
Africa, rather than increased demand,”  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “With the supply concerns, platinum is
attracting a lot of interest from funds.”  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
delivery in April rose 1.2 percent to settle at $1,717.20 an
ounce at 1:16 p.m. Prices have surged 18 percent since the end
of June as strikes disrupted output in South Africa, the world’s
top producer.  Zimbabwe has the largest known platinum and chrome reserves
after South Africa.  Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 1.7 percent to
$771.40 an ounce on the Nymex. Earlier, the price reached
$774.90, the highest since Sept. 6, 2011. Volume was about 48
percent higher than the 100-day average for this time of day.
The metal is typically found alongside platinum and both are
used mostly in pollution-control devices for cars.  Gold futures for April delivery gained 50 cents to
$1,649.60 an ounce on the Comex in New York, ending a three-
session slide.  Prices, which are trading below the 200-day moving average,
touched $1,639.50 today, the lowest since Jan. 4. The precious
metal has retreated 1.6 percent this year.  Silver futures for March delivery advanced 0.4 percent to
$31.019 an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
