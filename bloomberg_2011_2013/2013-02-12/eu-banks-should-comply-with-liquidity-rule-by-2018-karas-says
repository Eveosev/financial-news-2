The European Parliament lawmaker
leading the work on the Basel rules said banks should fully
comply with liquidity standards starting in 2018, one year ahead
of the schedule agreed on last month by global regulators.  National governments haven’t yet agreed on this strategy,
 Othmar Karas , said at a press briefing in Brussels today.
Ireland, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, has called on
nations to accept it, according to a document obtained by
Bloomberg News.  “We want the 100 percent to be reached in 2018,” said
Karas, a member of the European People’s Party from Austria.
This would mean that the measure would fully take effect at the
same time as a separate Basel rule on bank funding, he said.  The liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, is part of a sweeping
overhaul of bank rules, known as Basel III, that was agreed on
by regulators to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis that
followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The
measure requires banks to hold enough easy -to-sell assets to
survive a 30 day funding squeeze.  To contact the reporter on this story:
