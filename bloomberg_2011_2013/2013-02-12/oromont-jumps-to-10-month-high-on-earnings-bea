Toromont  Industries Ltd., a dealer
of Caterpillar Inc. construction equipment, jumped to its
highest level in more than 10 months as a Raymond James Ltd.
analyst upgraded the stock after it beat earnings expectations.  Toromont advanced as much as 5.5 percent to C$23.50, the
highest intraday level since March 28. The stock was up 4.1
percent to C$23.18 at 12:23 p.m. in Toronto. The company had
gained 5.6 percent this year through yesterday.  “Toromont provided a textbook example of why a well-run
equipment dealer can be a great business to own during both good
and bad times,” said  Ben Cherniavsky , Vancouver-based analyst
with Raymond James, said in a note to clients.  Cherniavsky raised the stock’s rating to outperform, the
equivalent of a buy, from market perform, equal to a hold, while
raising his price target to C$25.75 from C$21.  Toromont, based in Concord, Ontario, reported fourth-
quarter adjusted earnings of 59 Canadian cents a share
yesterday, compared with Cherniavsky’s estimate of 48 cents and
the average consensus expectation of 45 cents according to nine
analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  While new machine sales at Toromont’s Caterpillar dealers
dropped 20 percent year-over-year during the quarter, the
equipment group’s earnings before interest and taxes rose 10
percent to C$58 million, ahead of Cherniavsky’s C$47-million
estimate.  “The major factor behind this profit boost, and the big
fourth-quarter earnings beat, was a surge in aftermarket
revenues” based on a larger base of installed equipment and
more aggressive marketing for high-margin product support,
Cherniavsky said.  The company also raised its quarterly  dividend  8.3 percent
to 13 cents a share from 12 cents a share, payable on April 1 to
shareholders of record as of March 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
