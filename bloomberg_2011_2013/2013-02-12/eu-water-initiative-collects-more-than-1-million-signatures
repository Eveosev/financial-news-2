A group that wants to prevent the
privatization of water in the European Union and keep water
services in the public sector said its petition has surpassed 1
million signatures.  “Water is a Human Right,” a group run mainly by trade
unions that wants water services to remain accessible to all in
public hands, collected 1.05 million signatures and seeks to
double that by September, the group’s  website  showed.  Petitioners must collect at least 1 million signatures from
seven of the EU’s 27 member states in order to call on the
commission to draft formal legislation. Most of the signatures
in January came from Germany and Austria, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
