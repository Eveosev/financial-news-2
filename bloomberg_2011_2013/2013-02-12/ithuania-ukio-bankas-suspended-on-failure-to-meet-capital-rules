Lithuania temporarily suspended the
operations of  Ukio Bankas AB , the Baltic nation’s sixth-largest
lender by assets, saying it engaged in risky behavior and no
longer met capital-adequacy and liquidity requirements.  The central bank appointed a temporary administrator to
assess and report within six days on the bank, which is
controlled by Vladimir Romanov, the owner of Edinburgh soccer
club Heart of Midlothian Plc, according to an e-mailed statement
today from Vilnius, the capital.  “The decision was approved once it was clear that other
statutory enforcement measures would not be sufficient in
ensuring the security of the interests of depositors and the
general public,” the central bank said in the statement.  Ukio Bankas reported in October a net loss of 44 million
litai ($17 million) for the first nine months of 2012. It has
since had to assuage investor concerns about the quality of its
loans, the valuation of real estate it owns and probes into the
alleged laundering of embezzled Russian money through its
accounts.  The Nasdaq OMX Vilnius stock exchange said in a statement
that it had suspended trading of Ukio shares at the central
bank’s request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
