Jemella Group Ltd., the producer of
“ghd” brand of hair-styling products, is marketing 150 million
pounds ($235 million) of loans backing its buyout by Lion
Capital LLP.  The financing is being arranged by Lloyds Banking Group Plc
and a lender meeting will take place in London on Feb. 15,
according to a person with knowledge of the deal, who asked not
be named because the information is private.  The debt includes an 80 million-pound term loan B split
between pounds and euros, with the 60 million-pound equivalent
euro piece paying an interest margin of 525 basis points more
than benchmarks and the 20 million-pound portion paying 575
basis points, the person said.  There is also a 40 million-pound six-year term loan A, a 20
million-pound credit line and a 10 million-pound acquisition
facility, all paying a margin of 500 basis points, they said. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Shona Prendergast, a spokeswoman for Lion Capital, declined
to comment on the debt financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
