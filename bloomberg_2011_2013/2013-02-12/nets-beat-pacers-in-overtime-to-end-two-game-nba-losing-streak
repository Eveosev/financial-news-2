The Brooklyn Nets ended a two-game
National Basketball Association losing skid by beating the
Indiana Pacers 89-84 in overtime without All-Star point guard
 Deron Williams , who is sidelined with an ankle injury.  Brook Lopez  had 25 points and eight rebounds last night as
the Nets (30-22) won for the first time in their past six trips
to Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.  Joe Johnson  added 17
points while  Reggie Evans  grabbed 22 rebounds for Brooklyn.  The Pacers (31-21) were beaten at home in overtime for the
second straight contest following a 15-game winning streak in
Indianapolis.  George Hill  had 22 points to lead Indiana, which
was held to 34 percent shooting.  The Nets, who trail the first-place New York Knicks by 3
1/2 games in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division, said
yesterday that Williams would be out until after the All-Star
break. The NBA All-Star Game is scheduled for Feb. 17 in Houston,
so Williams would also miss tomorrow’s home game against the
Denver Nuggets.  In yesterday’s other NBA games, the San Antonio Spurs
improved their league-leading record to 41-12 with a 103-89 win
over the Chicago Bulls. The Spurs won for the 13th time in their
past 14 games even though they were without  Tim Duncan ,  Manu Ginobili  and  Tony Parker .  The Charlotte Bobcats beat Boston 94-91 behind a 25-point,
18-rebound performance by  Byron Mullens  to end the Celtics’
seven-game winning streak. The Los Angeles Clippers topped the
Philadelphia 76ers 107-90 for their second straight victory as
 Chris Paul  has 21 points and 11 assists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
