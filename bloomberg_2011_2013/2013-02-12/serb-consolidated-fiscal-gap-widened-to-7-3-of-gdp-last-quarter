Serbia’s consolidated fiscal
deficit, which includes spending by local governments and state-
controlled pension and health funds, expanded to 7.3 percent of
gross domestic product in the last quarter of 2012.  The shortfall rose from 4.1 percent of GDP in the third
quarter of 2012, the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said in
its monthly update of key macroeconomic indicators published
today. The central government’s budget gap widened to 5 percent
of GDP in the fourth quarter from 3.9 percent in the previous
three months, bringing the full-year average to 5.75 percent.  Premier  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, in office since July, wants
to narrow the fiscal gap to 3.6 percent of GDP this year. The
budget gap narrowed 32 percent in January from a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
