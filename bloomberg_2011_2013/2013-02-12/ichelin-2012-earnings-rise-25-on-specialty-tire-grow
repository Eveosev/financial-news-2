Michelin & Cie. , Europe’s largest
tiremaker, said sales volume and earnings probably won’t grow
this year as a recession that hurt the region’s car and truck
industries held back profit increases in 2012.  Michelin fell the most in three weeks in Paris trading
after reporting operating profit excluding one-time items of
2.42 billion euros ($3.24 billion) for last year. Earnings
missed the 2.52 billion-euro average of 12 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  The tire manufacturer is seeking more sales outside Europe
amid a regional automotive market contraction that French
carmaker  PSA Peugeot Citroen  expects at as much as 5 percent
this year. Faurecia, the car-parts producer controlled by
Peugeot, scrapped its dividend to conserve cash following a drop
in profit last year. Michelin today forecast “steady” tire
sales and “stable” earnings in 2013.  The tiremaker’s operating profit and the forecast for 2013
were “a little disappointing,”  Philip Watkins , an analyst at
Citigroup Inc. in London, said in a report to clients.  Michelin fell as much as 4 percent to 69.80 euros, the
biggest intraday drop since Jan. 22, and was trading down 3.6
percent at 9:30 a.m. The stock has fallen 2 percent this year,
valuing the tiremaker at 12.8 billion euros.  Margin Widens  Sales last year rose 3.6 percent to 21.5 billion euros,
Clermont-Ferrand, France-based Michelin said in a statement
today. Free cash flow was 1.08 billion euros compared with a
negative 19 million euros in 2011. Operating profit excluding
one-time gains or costs increased 25 percent, and earnings as a
proportion of sales rose to 11.3 percent from a 9.4 percent
margin a year earlier.  The company said in September that it plans to invest 1.6
billion euros to 2.2 billion euros a year through 2015 to fuel
the expansion and to reach an operating income of about 2.5
billion euros that year, with positive annual free cash flow
through the period. Michelin said today that it’s sticking to
the strategy, and announced plans to raise the  dividend  14
percent to 2.40 euros a share.  Faurecia , Europe’s largest maker of car interiors, reported
second-half operating profit plunged 32 percent to 211 million
euros. Sales increased 7 percent to 8.6 billion euros as growth
in North America and Asia offset a decline in its home region,
the Nanterre, France-based manufacturer said today. Faurecia,
which is 57 percent-owned by Peugeot, fell 2 percent to 13.55
euros in Paris.  Plant Shutdowns  Europe’s car market may contract to 12.3 million vehicles
this year, 23 percent below the pre-2008 global recession peak,
according to estimates by IHS Automotive research group.
Carmakers are responding by scaling back production, with
 Peugeot , the region’s second-biggest carmaker, planning to shut
a factory on the outskirts of Paris and  General Motors Co.  and
 Ford Motor Co.  closing a combined four plants across Europe.  Group volume at  Michelin  fell 6.4 percent last year because
of “weak demand, particularly in European markets,” the
company said. The number of car and light-truck tires sold
declined 5.5 percent, and the operating margin at the business,
excluding one-time gains or costs, declined 0.1 percentage point
to 9.3 percent.  The volume of tires for heavier vehicles dropped 11 percent
“as the group focused on turning the truck-tire business around
and restoring its margins.” Profitability almost doubled to 6.6
percent from 3.5 percent a year earlier. Specialty-tire sales
numbers rose 1.7 percent, and the margin at that division, which
supplies the aerospace and mining industries, increased to 26
percent from 21.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
