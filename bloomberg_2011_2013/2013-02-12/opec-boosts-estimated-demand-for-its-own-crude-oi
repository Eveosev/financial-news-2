OPEC raised forecasts for the amount
of crude it will need to supply this year because of stronger
fuel demand in emerging economies.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will have
to provide an average of 29.8 million barrels a day in 2013, or
100,000 a day more than it estimated a month ago. The producer
group’s output in January was 500,000 barrels a day larger than
this, at 30.3 million, according to OPEC’s monthly market report
published today.  “Given some signs of recovery in the global economy and
colder weather at the start of this year, the forecast for world
oil demand growth in 2013 has also been revised up,” OPEC’s
Vienna-based secretariat said. “The bulk of the growth is seen
coming from China.”  Brent crude futures have advanced 6.7 percent this year
amid signs of economic recovery in the U.S., acceleration in
China, and speculation that Europe has withstood the worst of
its debt turmoil. Brent traded at $118.60 on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange today.  Global oil demand will increase by 800,000 barrels a day,
or 0.9 percent, to 89.7 million a day, OPEC said. That marks an
increase of 80,000 barrels a day from last month’s report. China
will account for 400,000 barrels a day of this year’s growth.  Saudi Output  “If the economic situation continues to brighten up, then
there’s a good chance of seeing Brent oil prices higher than
$128,” said  Gerrit Zambo , an oil trader at Bayerische
Landesbank in Munich.  OPEC’s 12 members trimmed production last month by 21,000
barrels a day to 30.32 million a day, according to the report.
That leaves output 320,000 barrels a day higher than the
collective target of 30 million that the group’s 12 members
reaffirmed at their most recent meeting in December.  Saudi
Arabia , the group’s biggest member and de facto leader,
curtailed supplies by 75,800 barrels a day in January to 9.1
million a day.  OPEC Secretary-General  Abdalla El-Badri  said at a
conference in London on Jan. 28 that there is no need for OPEC
to restrain production if major economies appear to be
struggling and that he does not anticipate any collapse in
prices this year.  The organization kept its estimates for production from
outside the group in 2013 unchanged.  Non-OPEC producers , such as
the U.S., Canada and Brazil, will boost supplies by 900,000
barrels a day to 53.9 million.  OPEC comprises Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The organization is scheduled to meet
next in May.  The International Energy Agency, a Paris-based adviser to
consuming nations, will publish its next monthly forecasts of
supply and demand tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
