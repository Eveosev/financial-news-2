T. Rowe Price Group Inc., the
second-largest outside investor in Dell Inc., said it won’t
support the proposed $24.4 billion buyout of the computer maker
because it undervalues the company.  “We believe the proposed buyout does not reflect the value
of Dell and we do not intend to support the offer as put
forward,” Brian Rogers, T. Rowe’s chairman and chief investment
officer, said today in an e-mailed statement from Baltimore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
