Metso Oyj, a Finnish engineering
company, won an order to supply Bioenergeticheskaya Kompaniya
LLC in Russia with a plant that will use bark and waste wood
from sawmills to generate electricity and heat.  The 4-megawatt plant in the Komi Republic, in Russiaâ€™s
northwest, is expected to start working next year, Helsinki-
based Metso said today in a  statement  on its website. It
declined to disclose the value of the order. The power produced
will be fed into the local grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
