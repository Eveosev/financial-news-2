AllianceBernstein Holdings LP 
reported a fourth-quarter profit after a loss a year earlier as
the money manager attracted net new client assets for the first
time in five years.  Net income in the three months ended Dec. 31 rose to $26.2
million, or 26 cents a share, compared with a loss of $199.5
million, or $1.97 a share, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. The firm gathered $5 billion
in new money, the first time deposits outweighed redemptions
sine the fourth quarter of 2007.  “We finished 2012 strong, with greater stability in many
parts of our business and real momentum in others,” Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Kraus  said in the statement.  Contributions from institutional and retail customers more
than offset redemptions from its private client business, the
company said. The turnaround is a victory for Kraus, whose
contract was extended in June. Since the end of 2008,
AllianceBernstein lost more than $200 billion to withdrawals,
mainly from institutional accounts.  AllianceBernstein  fell  2.4 percent to $20.92 in New York.
Before today, the shares had gained 23 percent this year after
climbing 33 percent last year.  AllianceBernstein has increased assets in its fixed-income
business. The $25 billion AllianceBernstein Global High Yield
Portfolio won $3.3 billion in deposits in 2012, according to
Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. The fund, which is based in
Luxembourg, beat 86 percent of rivals over the past five years,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  AllianceBernstein had $437 billion in assets under
management as of Jan. 31, of which $256 billion were in fixed-
income and $99 billion in equity. At the end of 2007 total
assets were $800 billion.  AllianceBernstein was  raised  to outperform from market
perform at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in October, the third upgrade
for the stock since August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
