The Seattle Mariners and former Cy
Young Award winner  Felix Hernandez  have reached agreement on a
new contract that may make him the highest-paid pitcher in Major
League Baseball history.  The Mariners confirmed the agreement, without disclosing
contract terms, and said a news conference will be held today in
Seattle.  USA Today  reported last week that Hernandez would get
$175 million over seven years, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the contract.  Hernandez, a 26-year-old right-hander, has a 98-76 record
with a 3.22 earned run average over eight seasons with the
Mariners and won the Cy Young Award in 2010 as the best pitcher
in the American League. Seattle hasn’t reached the playoffs
since Hernandez made his major league debut at age 19 in 2005,
with two winning seasons in that span.  Hernandez’s contract would surpass the seven-year, $161
million deal that the New York Yankees gave  CC Sabathia  before
the 2009 season as the richest for a pitcher in MLB history.
It’s annual value of $25 million would eclipse the $24.5 million
that  Zack Greinke  will get each season from the Los Angeles
Dodgers under a six-year, $147 million contract signed in
December.  Hernandez, nicknamed “King Felix,” was set to make $19.5
million this season and $20 million in 2014 under the five-year,
$78 million deal he signed in January 2010, USA Today said. At
the time, Hernandez was coming off a season in which he went
19-5 with a 2.49 ERA. He then went 13-12 with a 2.27 ERA in 2010
to win the AL Cy Young.  Hernandez had a 13-9 record with a 3.06 ERA last season.
He’s made at least 30 starts each of the past seven years and
topped 230 innings and 200 strikeouts each of the last four
seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
