Zambian opposition parties accused
the government of using violence against political opponents,
stoking ethnic tensions and seeking to establish a one-party
state in Africa’s biggest copper producer.  The Coalition for the Defence of Democratic Rights, which
brings together Zambia’s biggest opposition parties, said today
that President  Michael Sata ’s government is repeatedly arresting
its members on politically motivated charges.  Nevers Mumba , the
president of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, and Hakainde
Hichilema, leader of the United Party for National Development,
were among the coalition members addressing reporters in
Johannesburg.  “The imprisonment, the harassments, the intimidation, the
curtailing of our freedoms to hold rallies and meetings” are
aimed at enforcing “a one-party state,” Mumba said.  Sata became president in September 2011 in his fourth
attempt to win power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
