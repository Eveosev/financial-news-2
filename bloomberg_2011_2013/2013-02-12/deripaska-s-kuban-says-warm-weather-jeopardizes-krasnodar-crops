Kuban Agricultural Holding,
controlled by billionaire  Oleg Deripaska ’s Basic Element, said
“abnormally” warm weather in Russia’s southern Krasnodar
region may put winter crops in jeopardy.  Temperatures in the last 10 days of January exceeded the
average by as much as 8 degrees Celsius (14.4 degrees
Fahrenheit), said the company, which is based in the town of
Ust-Labinsk in Krasnodar.  “Abnormally warm weather led to resumption of early
germination of winter crops, which can pose risks if frosts
return in February and March,” the company said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Once every decade on average, Krasnodar sees a weather
pattern in which frosts return in February and March after
initial cold spells in December or January. That last happened
in 2008, the company said. Temperatures of minus 15 degrees
Celsius and below would be “critical” for winter crops in
February, and minus 5 degrees Celsius in March could also
damage plants, according to the company.  The company planted winter wheat on more than 24,000
hectares (59,305 acres) and winter barley on about 4,000
hectares in 2012 for the crop that will be harvested in the
2013-14 season, it said. Krasnodar was Russia’s biggest crop
region after it harvested 8.8 million metric tons of grain, or
almost 13 percent of the national crop last year, according to
state statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
