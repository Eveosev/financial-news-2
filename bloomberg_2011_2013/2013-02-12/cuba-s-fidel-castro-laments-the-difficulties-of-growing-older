Cuba’s former President  Fidel Castro , who made a rare public appearance to vote in legislative
elections earlier this month, said his knee still bothers him
from a fall he took almost nine years ago and he has trouble
reading newspapers because of failing eyesight.  “I cannot read Granma sometimes as the letters are too
small,” Castro was quoted as saying on the state-run
newspaper’s  website  in an interview conducted Feb. 3. The 86-
year old leader broke his knee and arm in 2004, an injury which
has “taken its toll,” Castro said. He also complained about
the glare from television.  Since handing over power to his brother Raul in 2006,
Castro has mostly remained out of public view and instead writes
columns in state-run media known as “Reflections,” which have
grown more infrequent over the past year.  The publication of Castro’s comments comes one day after
85-year-old Pope Benedict XVI said he would step down as leader
of the Roman Catholic Church, the first pontiff to resign in
almost 600 years. Benedict cited his age and the demands of the
job in deciding to resign the papacy at the end of February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
