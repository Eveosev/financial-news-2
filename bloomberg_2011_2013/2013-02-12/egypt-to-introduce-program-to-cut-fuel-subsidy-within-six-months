Egypt, which is working to reduce
government spending, plans to introduce smart cards for
motorists within three to six months that would limit
consumption of subsidized fuel, according to its Oil Minister.  The system is being introduced to curb black market trade
in diesel, which has created shortages, Osama Kamal said today
in Cairo. Egypt, which is seeking a $4.8 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund, will use savings on fuel subsidies
to increase salaries in the next three to five years, the
minister said.  The Egyptian governmentâ€™s application for an IMF loan has
already been delayed twice. Prime Minister Hisham Qandil said on
Feb. 6 the government would invite IMF officials to return to
Cairo within the next few days, without being more specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
