Five cases of Chateau Angelus 2005
Saint-Emilion sold for 2,750 pounds ($4,300) each on the London-
based Liv-ex market, a record for the exchange and up 15 percent
from December, according to data on its Cellar Watch website.  Yesterdayâ€™s trade was 41 percent above a deal last August
and came after the wine producer was promoted to the top status
of Premier Grand Cru Classe A in the 2012 Saint-Emilion
classification last year. The vintage traded as high as $4,674
at an  Acker Merrall & Condit  auction in New York in April 2011,
at the height of demand for top Bordeaux wines.  Editors:  Peter Torday ,  Jim Silver   To contact the reporter on the story:
