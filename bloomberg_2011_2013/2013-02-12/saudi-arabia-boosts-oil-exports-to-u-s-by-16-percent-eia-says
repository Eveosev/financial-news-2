Saudi Arabiaâ€™s oil exports to the
U.S. increased by 17 percent in the first ten months of last
year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Daily shipments of crude, condensate and natural gas
liquids averaged 1.4 million barrels, exceeding the 1.2 million
for all of 2011, the EIA said in a  report  on its website
yesterday. Saudi Arabia is a shareholder in the  Port Arthur 
refinery in Texas through the Motiva Enterprises LLC venture.  Saudi Arabia accounted for 16 percent of U.S. crude imports
in the 10-month period, making it the second-biggest supplier,
after Canada, according to the report.  The kingdom produced on average 9.8 million barrels a day
of crude and 1.8 million barrels of natural gas liquids last
year, the EIA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
