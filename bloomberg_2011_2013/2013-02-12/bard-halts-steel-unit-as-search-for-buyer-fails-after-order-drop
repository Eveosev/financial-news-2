Bard Holding GmbH, a German offshore
wind developer seeking a buyer for all or parts of the business,
will cease output at Cuxhaven Steel Construction GmbH after it
failed to find an investor for the maker of turbine foundations.  Bard will dismiss 95 of the unit’s 120 workers and shift
the rest to other divisions,  Axel Bahr , a company spokesman,
said today by phone. Cuxhaven Steel will halt output April 30.  Bard,  RWE AG  and  REpower Systems SE  have been victims of
wrangling between the German government and grid operators over
sharing financial risks and upgrading the network as the nation
seeks to use wind power in favor of nuclear. Bard’s decision is
a setback after seeking to raise funds as technical challenges
increased costs, burned up cash and stalled its main project.  “The inevitable decision to discontinue business
operations ultimately reflects the present situation in the
offshore wind industry, which has for some time suffered from a
lack of new orders due in part to the uncertain political
framework conditions,” Emden-based Bard said in a statement.  Bard, a pioneer of deep-water offshore wind, is building
the 400-megawatt Bard Offshore 1 plant 100 kilometers (62 miles)
from Borkum island. It will focus on completing the project
while the sale continues, Bahr said, declining to elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
