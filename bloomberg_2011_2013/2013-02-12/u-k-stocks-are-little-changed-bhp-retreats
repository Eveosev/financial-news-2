U.K. stocks  advanced for a third day
as Barclays Plc led a rally in banking shares, outweighing a
decline in BHP Billiton Ltd.  Barclays contributed the most to gains in the FTSE 100
Index, climbing to the highest price in almost two years, after
the lender said it will cut jobs to lower costs. Lloyds Banking
Group Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc each added at
least 3 percent. BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining
company, lost 1.2 percent as workers at its Colombian mine
threatened to strike.  The  FTSE 100  rose 33.56 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,310.62
at 1:27 p.m. in London. The equity benchmark dropped 1.3 percent
last week amid political uncertainty in Italy and Spain. The
gauge has still gained 7 percent so far this year. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index also added 0.5 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index advanced 0.7 percent.  The reduction in Barclays jobs is “a larger figure than
was discussed in the press,”  Otto Dichtl , managing director of
Knight Capital Europe Ltd., said in an interview with Mark
Barton and Caroline Hyde on Bloomberg Television. “The main
focus is on the strategic review. Overall, the announcements are
not completely out of line with expectations, and in some cases,
delivering a bit more. You can still find an argument for why
banks should do well over time.”  The volume of shares changing hands on FTSE 100-listed
companies was 36 percent higher than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The volume of
shares traded in Barclays was thrice the average of the last
five days, the data show.  Obama’s Speech  In the U.S., President  Barack Obama  delivers his State of
the Union address at 9 p.m. in Washington. He will offer
proposals for spending on infrastructure, clean energy and
education, according to an administration official briefed on
the speech.  Barclays jumped 7.1 percent to 322.75 pence, the highest
price since Feb. 23, 2011, after saying it will eliminate 3,700
jobs to cut annual costs by 1.7 billion pounds ($2.6 billion).
Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins  said Barclays will target
a return on equity above its 11.5 percent cost of equity, after
the lender posted its first full-year loss in two decades.  A  gauge of banking shares  in the FTSE 350 Index climbed 2.4
percent. Lloyds advanced 3.8 percent to 54.8 pence and RBS
gained 3 percent to 350.6 pence.  BHP Strike  BHP Billiton slid 26 pence to 2,133.5 pence after workers
at its Colombian Cerro Matoso mine, the world’s second-largest
nickel producer, threatened to strike if the company disciplines
a laborer.  BHP will hold a disciplinary hearing Feb. 14 to decide
whether to sanction mine worker Jamer Ledesma for an alleged
breach of a safety procedure, Sintracerromatoso union leader
Domingo Hernandez said late yesterday. The union will decide by
Feb. 21 whether to halt work, depending on the outcome,
Hernandez said.  BAE Systems Plc dropped 1.8 percent to 330.45 pence after
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Cazenove unit started coverage of the
shares with a neutral rating, saying Europe’s biggest weapons
maker faces structural problems and that its shares will perform
worse than the industry average over the next 12 to 24 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
