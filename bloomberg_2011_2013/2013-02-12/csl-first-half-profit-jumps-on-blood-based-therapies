CSL Ltd. , Australia’s biggest
pharmaceutical company, reported a 24 percent increase in first-
half profit as demand for blood-derived treatments increased.  Net income climbed to $627 million in the six months ended
Dec. 31 from $504 million a year earlier, Melbourne-based CSL
said today. Sales jumped 11 percent to $2.48 billion.  Demand for immunoglobulin products, which raise infection-
fighting antibody levels, and royalties earned from treatments
such as Merck & Co.’s Gardasil cervical-cancer vaccine boosted
earnings.  Earnings were reported before the start of trading in
Australia.  CSL  rose 0.4 percent to A$57.24 at the close of
trading in Sydney yesterday. The shares have advanced 6.2
percent this year, trailing a 6.7 percent increase in
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index.  CSL surged 68 percent last year, making it the best
performing stock in the  S&P/ASX 20 , which typically includes the
nation’s 20 largest stocks.  The company said full-year earnings-per-share will rise
about 24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
