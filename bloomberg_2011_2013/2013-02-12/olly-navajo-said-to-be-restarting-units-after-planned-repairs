HollyFrontier Corp . is restarting
equipment at the  Navajo  oil refinery in New Mexico as it nears
the end of a planned maintenance turnaround, a person familiar
with the work said.  Units at the refinery’s Lovington plant have returned to
service, and work at the Artesia plant is expected to be
completed over the next week, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the information isn’t public. Artesia
units will also begin restarting within a week, the person said.  The Navajo refinery, consisting of the two plants about 65
miles (105 kilometers) apart, can process 100,000 barrels a day,
HollyFrontier said in a presentation last month. The refinery
runs sour and heavy crudes and distributes products to Arizona,
New Mexico and western Texas, the presentation shows.  Julia Heidenreich , a spokeswoman at HollyFrontier’s
headquarters in Dallas, declined by e-mail to comment on the
refinery’s turnaround schedule.  The maintenance at the Navajo refinery was expected to last
six to eight weeks, Hayley Klein, executive director of the
Artesia Chamber of Commerce, said Jan. 15. Workers began
arriving the week of Jan. 7 for the repairs, she said.  The refinery planned to shut a crude unit, a fluid
catalytic cracker and alkylation unit as part of the work, the
company said Nov. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
