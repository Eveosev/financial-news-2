Yields on Serbia’s domestic debt
continued to drop in a Treasury bill sale as improved economic
data and currency trades driven by rate differences lured
investors.  The government sold the full offer of 10-billion dinar
($120.5 million) of 53-week Treasury bills, with yields falling
by 75 basis points, or three-quarters of a percentage point,
from last month, to 10.49 percent, the Debt Management Agency in
the capital Belgrade, said in an e-mailed statement today.
Investors’ bids amounted to 29.6 billion dinars.  “We see downside yield risks amid resurgent carry
trades,” analysts at Zagreb-based Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank DD,
including  Hrvoje Stojic , said in a note to investors before the
auction. Borrowing costs have been declining amid a “lack of
investment alternatives” as this year’s gross refinancing needs
of around 17 percent of gross domestic product “are expected to
be at least by half secured from abroad,” they said.  Premier  Ivica Dacic ’s seven-month-old government is paying
4.1 percentage points less on 53-week debt than in September
2012, when yields peaked at 14.59 percent. The only time Serbia
paid less than 10 percent to raise dinars in the local market
was between February and May 2010, according to central bank
 data .  The budget deficit narrowed 32 percent in January from a
year earlier on improved sales tax collection and a public debt
decline of 0.7 percent to 17.5 billion euros ($23.5 billion), or
59.9 percent of Serbia’s economic output, the government said
yesterday.  Fundamentals  “Stronger fundamentals” also support the Serbian dinar,
which benefits from “a highly attractive carry” of some “0.9
percent per month,” Societe Generale emerging-market analysts
including  Benoit Anne  in London, said in a note to investors
today. They target the dinar at 108 to the euro in the next few
months. The dinar traded at 111.6038 at 1:37 p.m. in Belgrade,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dacic wants to narrow the budget gap to 3.6 percent of GDP
from more than 6 percent in 2012 and plans to borrow $2 billion
in foreign markets through Eurobonds in addition to a $1
billion-loan from Russia to finance the budget gap and repay
debts.  Junk-rated Serbia sold $750 million worth of five-year
notes in November and wants to sell a seven-year bond before it
agrees to a new deal with the International Monetary Fund,
Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic told Bloomberg on Jan. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
