Natural gas futures may decline as a
technical indicator based on moving averages turns bearish,
according to Energy Security Analysis Inc.  The moving average convergence-divergence indicator, or
MACD, has been negative since Jan. 29, signaling that gas prices
may drop, said  Chris Kostas , senior power and gas analyst for
Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Andover, Massachusetts.  The MACD is the 12-day exponential moving average minus the
26-day exponential moving average. The average gives more weight
to the latest data, compared with a simple moving average.  “I’m definitely slightly bearish,” Kostas said. “The
bull market doesn’t exist for anyone who’s trading the March
contract.”  Gas for March delivery rose 0.7 cent to settle at $3.279
per million British thermal units yesterday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The futures climbed to $3.418 per million
Btu on Feb. 6, the highest in more than a week. The front-month
contract is up 32 percent from a year ago.  Gas futures may fall to $3.10 per million Btu, a key
support level, in the next week, Kostas said. Prices last slid
below $3.10 on Jan. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
