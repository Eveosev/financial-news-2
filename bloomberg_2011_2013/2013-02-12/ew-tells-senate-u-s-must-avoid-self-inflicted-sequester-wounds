U.S. Treasury secretary nominee Jack
Lew says the U.S. must avoid the automatic spending cuts
scheduled to take effect next month, saying they would impose
“self-inflicted wounds” on economic expansion.  Lew was commenting in written testimony prepared for 
tomorrow's hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, which is
considering his nomination to succeed  Timothy F. Geithner  as
head of the Treasury Department. The prepared testimony was
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Lew said the U.S. must move forward with deficit reduction
while leaving “sufficient room for critical investments.”  “We also have to avoid doing anything to degrade our
national security or derail the economic recovery through abrupt
moves in the short term,” Lew said. “That is why we cannot
allow the series of harmful automatic spending cuts known as the
sequester to go into effect on March 1.”  “These cuts would impose self-inflicted wounds to the
recovery and put far too many jobs and businesses at risk,” Lew
said.  President  Barack Obama  and Republicans are locked in a
standoff over how to avert $1.2 trillion in automatic spending
cuts start to take effect on March 1 unless Congress acts to
stop or replace them. In addition, a temporary suspension of the
nation’s $16.4 trillion debt ceiling only runs through May 18.  “We must put our nation back on a path of fiscal
sustainability,” Lew said in the testimony prepared for
tomorrow. “And we can do even more to shrink the deficit over
the next decade through a balanced mix of spending reductions
and tax reforms, and sensible reforms to Medicare that will help
the program stay sound in the future.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
