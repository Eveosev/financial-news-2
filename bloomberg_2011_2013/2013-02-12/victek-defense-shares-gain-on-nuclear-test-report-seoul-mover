Victek Co.  led gains among South
Korean defense-related stocks in Seoul trading on speculation
North Korea conducted a nuclear test today.  Victek, a maker of electronic warfare equipment, jumped 11
percent to 2,415 won as of 1:13 p.m. on the Korea Exchange, its
biggest intraday gain since Feb. 4. Firstec Co., a maker of
components for helicopters and armored vehicles, rose 10
percent, while  Speco Co.  added 12 percent.  North Korea likely conducted its third nuclear test today,
a South Korean government official said, escalating tensions
with an international community that has sought to curb the
totalitarian state’s atomic ambitions. The U.S. Geological
Survey said it recorded a 4.9-magnitude quake in North Korea.  “The news drove defense stocks nicely up,” Kim Gi Bo, a
Seoul-based fund manager at Friend Investment Management, said
today. “But in many cases, it’s irrelevant to the companies’
earnings so investors should be cautious in making
investments.”  North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. South
and North Korea technically remain at war after their 1950-1953
conflict ended without a peace treaty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
