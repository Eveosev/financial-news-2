Glencore International Plc , the
world’s largest publicly traded commodities supplier, said 2012
coal production more than doubled after the acquisition of new
operations in South Africa.  Output of the fuel used in power stations rose to 41.8
million metric tons from 20.5 million tons, the Baar,
Switzerland-based company said today in a statement. Copper
output rose 3.9 percent to 376,700 tons.  Glencore is seeking to complete a $36 billion takeover of
 Xstrata Plc  next month, adding coal, zinc, copper and nickel
assets to create the world’s fourth-biggest mining company. The
combined entity will have interests in about 35 coal mines in
Colombia, Africa and Australia, and account for about 10 percent
of global seaborne exports.  Cobalt production gained 1.6 percent to 13,090 tons,
Glencore said. Zinc production was 534,400 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
