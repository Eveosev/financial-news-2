Dun & Bradstreet Inc. , the 171-year-
old provider of business data and risk-management services,
tumbled the most in three months after sluggish North American
sales dragged down the company’s fourth-quarter results.  Shares of the Short Hills, New Jersey-based company fell
7.7 percent to $78.68 at the close in New York. The stock has
gained less than 1 percent this year, while the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index has advanced 6.5 percent.  The company posted fourth-quarter earnings yesterday of
$2.38 a share, excluding some items. Analysts had estimated
$2.40 on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
fell to $463.1 million, missing the $475.3 million predicted by
analysts.  “We are disappointed with our performance particularly in
North America, where we took a step back in 2012 after two years
of steady improvement,” Sara Mathew, chief executive officer of
Dun & Bradstreet, said in a call with investors to discuss
earnings. “As you would expect, the No. 1 priority in 2013 is
to stabilize our risk business and get North America back to
growth.”  The stock fell the most since Nov. 15, the day Dun &
Bradstreet decided against pursuing a sale of the company,
according to a report by Reuters at the time. It had been
working with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Credit Suisse Group to
explore a deal, a person with knowledge of the situation said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
