Relationship Science, a startup
backed by billionaires such as  Kenneth Langone  and  Henry Kravis ,
unveiled a professional-networking service today that uses
Internet research to connect elite decision-makers.  The service will map users’ relationships with more than 2
million influential people in the worlds of business, finance
and nonprofit organizations, helping them make deals, sell
products and raise money, RelSci said in a statement.  RelSci, based in New York, looks to gain an edge on
LinkedIn Corp. and Facebook Inc. by not relying on social
networks or user-inputted content. The service will cull the Web
for relevant information on business leaders and their
relationships, and use that research to show how people connect.
That means contacts don’t need to voluntarily participate to
have their information included.  “As someone who has raised capital, extensively engaged in
direct selling and built mutually productive partnerships
throughout my career, I continuously grasped for ways to better
leverage information and my relationships,” RelSci founder Neal
Goldman, who also co-founded financial-information provider
Capital IQ, said in the statement. “I always thought there had
to be an easier way to identify and connect with the people and
organizations I needed to reach to achieve my goals. So I
decided to create RelSci to fill that need.”  The company is backed by $60 million from investors such as
Langone, Kravis and Hearst Corp. It has more than 500 employees,
with 125 at its New York headquarters, RelSci said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
