(Corrects to say restructuring hasn’t been completed in
third and fifth paragraphs of story first published Feb. 12.)  Cia. Pesquera Camanchaca SA, Chile’s
fourth-biggest fishing and salmon farming company by revenue,
rose to a nine-month high on speculation that price increases
will improve profits this year.  Camanchaca rose 1.5 percent to 34 pesos at the close of
trading in Santiago, its highest price since May 15, and has
gained 4.6 percent in the two days since Santiago-based broker
Larrain Vial  rated  the company a buy.  Larrain Vial, Chile’s largest equity broker, raised its
recommendation from hold and said that Camanchaca may reach 39
pesos by the end of 2013, citing improved profit margins on
expectations of a recovery in salmon and fish prices and
benefits from a debt restructuring it’s working on, analyst
 Johanna Castro  said in an e-mailed note dated yesterday.  “Salmon prices bottomed out in the last quarter of 2012,”
Castro said in the report. “After its bank debt restructuring,
cash flow will be enough to operate without additional liquidity
injections or asset sales.”  Camanchaca is working on a restructuring of its $234
million in bank loans, Larrain Vial said in its report, without
saying where it obtained the information. Phone calls to the
company’s press department seeking comment weren’t answered.  Larrain Vial also reiterated a buy recommendation for
AquaChile SA, Chile’s largest listed salmon exporter by revenue.
Its shares rose 1.8 percent to 346 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
