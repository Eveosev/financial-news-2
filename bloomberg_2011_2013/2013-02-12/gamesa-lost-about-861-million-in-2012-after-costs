Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA , Spain’s
biggest wind turbine-maker, expects a net loss of about 640
million ($861 million) euros in 2012 after one-time expenses of
585 million euros from its cost-cutting program.  Profit was about 7 million euros before interest, tax and
restructuring expenses from cost cuts and writedowns, Chief
Executive Officer  Ignacio Martin  said yesterday in a conference
call. That compares with about 131 million euros in 2011.  “Very few of these writedowns are cash-related,” Martin
said. “Most are accounting issues. It means that the balance
sheet of Gamesa when looking to the future is a very solid
one.”  The estimates are the first update of progress on a program
announced in October to eliminate 1,800 jobs amounting to 20
percent of the workforce by the end of the first quarter. About
800 workers had already been let go before that decision.  Gamesa’s shares jumped as much 8.2 percent in Madrid and
traded at 2.11 euros, up 5.9 percent, as of 9:35 a.m. local
time. The 1.6 million shares traded in the first 35 minutes were
more than half of its average daily volume in the past three
months.  “The balance sheet clean-up undoubtedly puts Gamesa at a
better position to face the industry’s challenges,” Banco BPI
analyst  Flora Trindade  wrote in an e-mailed report today. The
restructuring measures “set the basis for the group’s targeted
profitability improvements.”  Costs Reduction  The manufacturer intends to close more than a third of its
offices, reduce debt and expand its turbine-servicing unit under
a strategy stretching through 2015.  It’s targeting a 100 million-euro reduction in fixed costs
and has already reached 90 percent of that goal, Martin said.
Gamesa in 2012 generated 214 million euros of cash and reduced
its net debt to 496 million euros, staying in “full
compliance” with its loan covenants, Gamesa said on its
website. Martin said the company doesn’t plan to pay a dividend
for 2012.  The company has also decided to sell U.S. wind farm assets
valued at 104 million euros, according to a  presentation  posted
yesterday on its website.  Gamesa has reported three consecutive quarters of net
losses, including its first half-year loss since 2000. In a Feb.
7 presentation, it blamed its slump on a drop in electricity
demand, changing clean-energy regulations in Spain and an excess
of industrial capacity.  Profit Margin  It’s seeking to raise its profit margin before tax and
interest to 3 percent to 5 percent this year and as much as 10
percent in 2015. Martin yesterday reiterated the company’s 2013
margin guidance.  Gamesa is due to announce fourth-quarter earnings on Feb.
28. Yesterday’s announcement was made after the close of Madrid
trading. Shares yesterday rose 1.6 percent in Madrid to 2 euros.
The stock has gained 20 percent this year.  In October, Gamesa forecast 2013 sales totaling 1,800 to
2,000 megawatts, rising to as much as 2,400 megawatts in 2015.
The manufacturer plans to develop two new turbine models, rated
at 2.5 megawatts and 5.5 megawatts, the latter for use at sea.  Last year, Gamesa dropped out of the top five turbine
makers by market share, according to preliminary data from
Navigant Consulting Inc.’s BTM Consult unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
