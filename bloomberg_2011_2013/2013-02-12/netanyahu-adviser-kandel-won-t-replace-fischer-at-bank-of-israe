Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s top economic adviser  Eugene Kandel  won’t replace
 Stanley Fischer  as the country’s central bank governor after
Fischer steps down in June.  Kandel, who heads the National Economic Council, told
Netanyahu that he would like to continue in his current position
and that he isn’t a candidate for governor, according to an e-
mailed statement from Kandel’s office today.  “Kandel stressed his desire to continue to lead the
National Economic Council and help the prime minister and his
government deal with the strategic challenges faced by the
Israeli economy,” according to the statement.  Fischer announced last month he would step down in June
after eight years as central bank governor. He has not yet
announced what he plans to do next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
