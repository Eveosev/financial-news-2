Prime Minister  David Cameron 
proposed a “royal charter” to solve the problem of how to
regulate the U.K. press without passing a law that media
companies said could hurt free speech.  Judge  Brian Leveson  concluded his government-mandated probe
into media ethics Nov. 29 by urging Cameron to legislate to
create a basis for a new press regulator. The prime minister
responded at the time by saying he wasn’t prepared to “cross
the Rubicon” by passing a law.  Instead, his Conservative Party today proposed using a
royal charter, whereby  Queen Elizabeth II  would sign an
instrument creating a “recognition panel” that would have the
job of saying whether regulators were sufficiently independent
of the press and were protecting the interests of the public.  Cameron’s Liberal Democrat coalition partners and the
opposition Labour Party have both said they support implementing
Leveson’s proposals for a regulator in full.  To contact the reporter on this story:
