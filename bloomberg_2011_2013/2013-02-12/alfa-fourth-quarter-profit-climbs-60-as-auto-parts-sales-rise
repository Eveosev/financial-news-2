Alfa SAB , which controls Mexico’s
largest publicly traded petrochemical company, said fourth-
quarter profit rose 60 percent as sales climbed at its auto-
parts and food divisions.  Net income advanced to $115 million from $72 million
a year  earlier , Alfa said today in a statement. Sales increased
4.2 percent to $3.69 billion.  Profit rose after Alfa’s auto-parts unit, Nemak, acquired
J.L. French Automotive Castings Inc., an aluminum components
producer based in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, in June. Sales climbed
15 percent at Nemak and 8.3 percent at the Sigma food division,
which makes lunch meats, cheese and yogurt.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, advanced 22 percent to $433 million,
San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico-based Alfa said. That compared
with a forecast of $461 million in fourth-quarter Ebitda by
 Marcos Duran , an analyst at Scotiabank in Mexico City who rates
the shares sector underperform.  Sales at  Alpek SAB , Alfa’s publicly traded petrochemical
division, fell 2.9 percent to $1.67 billion, Alfa said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
