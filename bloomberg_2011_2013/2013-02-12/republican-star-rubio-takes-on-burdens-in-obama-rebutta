Florida  Senator Marco Rubio called on President  Barack Obama  to “abandon his obsession with raising taxes” in the Republican response to the president’s  State of the Union  speech.  “Raising taxes won’t create private sector jobs,” Rubio said tonight in the first bilingual response to the president’s speech, in English and Spanish. “More government isn’t going to help you get ahead,” he added. “It’s going to hold you back.”  Republicans see Rubio as their bridge to Hispanic voters and to the young. His speech, delivered first in English and then in Spanish, covered Republican themes, including opposition to tax increases and a need to overhaul programs such as the Medicare health-care system for the aged.  Obama Seeks Minimum Wage Boost to Bolster Economy in Speech “I would never support any changes to Medicare that would hurt seniors like my mother,” Rubio said. “But anyone who is in favor of leaving Medicare exactly the way it is right now, is in favor of bankrupting it.”  Tonight’s speech was a high-risk, potentially high-reward mission for the 41-year-old son of Cuban immigrants, the second- youngest Republican in the chamber.  Viewed by many of his Senate colleagues as a rising star in the  Republican Party , Rubio is one of three Hispanics in the chamber. Republicans say he’s well-positioned to help the party woo Latino voters, 71 percent of whom backed Obama in November.  ‘Fresh Face’  Rubio is “a fresh face, but I think he’s got a great ability to communicate in a way that people understand,” Senator  Richard Burr , a North Carolina Republican, said in an interview in advance of the speech. “And I think that’s what we need right now.”  Rubio said his parents aren’t millionaires and that they came to the U.S. “because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy.”  “So Mr. President, I don’t oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich,” the senator said. “I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors.”  Elected in 2010 with backing from the anti-tax  Tea Party , Rubio has cultivated a more moderate image over the past two years. He’s a leader of a bipartisan Senate effort to rewrite U.S. immigration laws, one of Obama’s second-term priorities.  “We need a responsible, permanent solution to the problem of those who are here illegally,” Rubio said tonight. “But first, we must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws.”  Women’s Groups  Rubio drew criticism earlier today from women’s groups, another constituency that mostly supported Obama in November, for being one of 22 Republicans who voted against legislation today reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. The measure would provide government programs and aid to victims. The Senate passed the bill 78-22.  Wisconsin Representative  Paul Ryan ’s 2011 State of the Union response helped elevate his profile the year before  Mitt Romney  chose him as his presidential running mate. Still, Louisiana Governor  Bobby Jindal ’s 2009 performance was panned and was seen as hampering his national political aspirations.  Rubio’s speech was the latest entry in his budding national profile. In August, he followed actor  Clint Eastwood ’s now- infamous diatribe to an empty chair at the  Republican National Convention  in Tampa, Florida, to introduce Romney for his acceptance speech.  The Feb. 18 cover of Time magazine features Rubio and the headline “The Republican Savior,” spurring criticism from Christian groups and prompting Rubio to post on Twitter, “There is only one savior, and it is not me. #Jesus.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Kathleen Hunter in Washington at  khunter9@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jodi Schneider at  jschneider50@bloomberg.net
