European Union consumers may
temporarily cut back on consumption of processed beef products
after horse meat was discovered in lasagna and moussaka labeled
as containing cow, according to Rabobank International.  “You can expect some decline in purchases of processed
meat products,”  Albert Vernooij , red-meat analyst at Rabobank,
said by phone. “There will be a small effect on consumption,
but it will be temporary. It depends on how quickly the cause is
determined, and how long it stays in the news.”  Supermarkets in the U.K., France, Ireland and Germany
removed frozen beef burgers and lasagnas from shelves after the
horse-meat finding, and France has threatened sanctions for
negligence and fraud.  The EU has forecast 2013 beef consumption of 7.74 million
metric tons, little changed from last year. Beef accounts for
about 19 percent of meat consumption in the 27-nation bloc, with
pork making up almost half.  “This could create some pressure for companies who process
beef, and maybe on beef prices,” Vernooij said. “It’ll be
temporary, because there is a shortage of beef in the world.
Mainly because of demand in Asia.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
