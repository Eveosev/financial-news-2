Whitehaven Coal Ltd. , Australia’s
second-biggest independent coal producer, rose the most in
almost two months after gaining conditional approval to build
the A$766 million ($789 million) Maules Creek mine.  Whitehaven  climbed 7.1 percent to A$3.17 at 10:39 a.m.
local time, the most since Dec. 19. The Sydney-based company has
now recovered most of 5.3 percent plunge on Feb. 7 when federal
government approval for the mine was delayed.  Australia’s Environment Minister  Tony Burke  yesterday
approved Whitehaven’s proposed Maules Creek coal mine in New
South Wales state, while asking for additional work including
limiting clearance of vegetation to minimize its environmental
impact. The government also approved Idemitsu Kosan Ltd.’s
Boggabri mine and AGL Energy Ltd.’s Gloucester coal seam methane
project.  The federal environment department last week said it was
delaying approvals for Maules Creek and an expansion of Boggabri
to jointly assess the environmental impact of the two projects,
located in close proximity in New South Wales state’s Gunnedah
basin.  AGL climbed 0.1 percent to A$15.27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
