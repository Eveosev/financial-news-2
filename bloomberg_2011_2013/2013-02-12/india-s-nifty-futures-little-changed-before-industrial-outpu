Indian  stocks climbed for the first
time in nine days as some investors judged the longest stretch
of declines in 15 months as excessive.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index , or Sensex, rose 0.5 percent
to 19,565.91, according to preliminary closing prices.  Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. , India’s biggest energy explorer, ended a
seven-day drop after third-quarter profit beat estimates.  Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. , the nation’s most valuable
drugmaker, and  Bharti Airtel Ltd. , the country’s largest cell-
phone operator, climbed 2 percent each.  The Sensex slid for eight straight days through yesterday,
the longest losing stretch since November 2011, as a government
economic expansion forecast disappointed investors and earnings
from some of the nation’s biggest companies trailed estimates.
The gauge’s 14-day relative strength index, a measure of how
rapidly prices rose or fell in the period, was at 37 yesterday.
A reading of below 30 is a signal to buy for some investors.  Overseas funds bought $285 million of Indian equities on
Feb. 8, extending this year’s purchases to a net $7.42 billion,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. They  bought  $24.5 billion of
stock last year, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, excluding China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
