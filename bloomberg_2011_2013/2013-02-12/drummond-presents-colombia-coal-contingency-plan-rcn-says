Drummond Co. ’s Colombian unit
presented a contingency plan to the government in a bid to
restart coal-unloading operations halted after an accident,
radio station  RCN  reported.  Government authorities will take at least 48 hours to
review the plan, a condition for renewing Drummond’s coal-
unloading license suspended six days ago, RCN said, citing
Captain Guillermo Diaz, director of the Colombian Maritime
Authority.  David Robertson, a Drummond spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to a telephone call requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
