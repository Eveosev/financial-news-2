LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA 
named the head of its Tag Heuer watch unit to take charge of the
Bulgari jewelry business in the latest management shuffle after
Decemberâ€™s departure of the chief of its Louis Vuitton brand.  Jean-Christophe Babin, who has led Tag Heuer since joining
LVMH in 2000, will take over as chief executive officer of
Bulgari in the course of the first half, Paris-based LVMH said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The appointment comes two months after Bulgari head  Michael Burke  was named successor to Louis Vuitton CEO  Jordi Constans .
Constans left a month after taking the post because of illness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
