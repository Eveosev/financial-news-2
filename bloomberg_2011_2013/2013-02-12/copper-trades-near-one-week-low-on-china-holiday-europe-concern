Copper traded near a one-week low as
markets in China, the biggest buyer of the metal, are closed
this week for the Lunar New Year holiday and data this week may
show a contraction in euro-zone economies.  The metal for delivery in three months traded little
changed at $8,190.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
at 3:00 p.m. in Seoul. The price yesterday fell 1.2 percent, the
biggest drop since Dec. 20, touching $8,171, the lowest intra-
day level since Jan. 31. Futures for March delivery were also
little changed at $3.7195 a pound on the Comex in New York.  “Lack of interest drift is the best way to describe
sentiment,” RBC Capital Markets Ltd. said in a report. “The
absence of the Chinese is definitely being felt.”  Euro-area economic data due this week will probably show
the damage inflicted by the region’s sovereign debt crisis with
the worst quarterly decline in output for almost four years.
Gross domestic product shrank 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter,
according to the median of 45 estimates gathered by Bloomberg
News.  “Aluminum sentiment could turn more positive” after
United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest producer, forecast global
demand will increase 6 percent this year, Nick Trevethan, a
commodities strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd., said in a report today. “China’s auto sales jumped 18
percent month-on-month to 1.73 million vehicles in January.”  On the LME, lead and zinc fell, while nickel rose and
aluminum and was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
