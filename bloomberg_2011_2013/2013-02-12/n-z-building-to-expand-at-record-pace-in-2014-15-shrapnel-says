New Zealand’s building industry will
expand at a record pace in 2014 and 2015, led by repairs and new
construction after the Christchurch earthquake, according to BIS
Shrapnel Pty, a Sydney-based forecaster.  The value of building will probably rise to about NZ$10
billion ($8.4 billion) a year, the forecaster said in a
statement e-mailed to Bloomberg News. Construction was NZ$7
billion in the year through September 2012, according to
government figures.  About 8,000 homes in Christchurch and surrounding districts
require replacement after being demolished while 30,000 damaged
homes need significant repair, BIS Shrapnel said. Central bank
Governor  Graeme Wheeler  last month said the quake rebuild will
start to stoke domestic demand and incomes, boosting the
economic recovery.  “We expect quake-related dwelling consents to peak between
2014 and 2015 before it starts to taper off,” Adeline Wong,
senior projects manager at BIS Shrapnel, said in the statement.  Still, weaker demand for housing in Canterbury, resulting
from lower population growth in the aftermath of the earthquake,
will keep dwelling consents about 15 percent below the annual
average for the boom period of 2004 to 2008, she said.  Building in Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, is likely
to accelerate to help eliminate a shortage of homes, which is
likely to be about 10,000 units over the next two years before
declining, Wong said.  Auckland residential building won’t match the high levels
of the early 2000s because high median house prices constrain
demand from first-home buyers, she said. Prices in the city rose
12 percent in January from a year earlier, the Real Estate
Institute said in a report yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
