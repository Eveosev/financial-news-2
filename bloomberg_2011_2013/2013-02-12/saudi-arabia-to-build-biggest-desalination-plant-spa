Saline Water Conversion Corp. plans
to build the world’s largest water desalination plant in Rabigh
on Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast, the state-owned  Saudi Press
Agency  reported, citing SWCC without disclosing costs.  The plant being developing by the Saudi government agency
responsible for making seawater potable in the desert kingdom
will have the capacity to pump 600,000 cubic meters (158 million
gallons) of desalinated water a day. The project is expected to
be completed by 2018, SPA said yesterday.  Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer with the Arab
world’s largest economy, allocated $6.4 billion for water and
sanitation projects in 2013 and is building power stations to
cope with growing demand and desalination plants to supply
drinking water to lessen the country’s reliance on oil exports.  State-owned National Water Co. plans to spend $66 billion
on plants and upgrades over the next 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
