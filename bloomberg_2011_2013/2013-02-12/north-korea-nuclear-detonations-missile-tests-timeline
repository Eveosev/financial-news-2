North Korea conducted its third
underground nuclear test today, three weeks after the United
Nations increased sanctions against Kim Jong Un’s regime
following its December long-range rocket and satellite launch.  North Korea detonated “an atomic warhead that is lighter
and miniaturized but with a big explosive charge,” the official
Korean Central News Agency said today. South Korea said the
nuclear explosion took place at 11:57 a.m. local time with an
estimated yield of 6 to 7 kilotons, bigger than North Korea’s
previous tests in 2006 and 2009.  The UN strengthened sanctions against North Korea after it
launched an Unha-3 long-range rocket in December. The North
began developing ballistic missiles in the 1970s and its current
arsenal of operational weapons includes Musudan rockets, which
may be able to carry a 650 kilogram (1,430 pound) warhead as far
as 3,000 kilometers (1,860 miles), according to South Korea’s
Defense Ministry.  1976-1981:  Begins development using SCUD-B missile from  the Soviet Union and launch pad from Egypt.  1984:       First SCUD-B missile test firing.  1988:       Operational deployment of SCUD-B and SCUD-C  missiles.  1990:       First Rodong missile test firing.  1998:       Operational deployment of Rodong missiles,  which have a range of 1,300 kilometers.
