Tiger Brands Ltd. , a South African
food producer, dropped the most in more than 16 months after
saying trading conditions continue to be challenging.  The stock slid 4.2 percent to 297 rand at the close in
Johannesburg trading, the most since October 2011 and snapping
three days of advances. Almost 640,000 securities changed hands,
27 percent higher than the three-month daily average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The domestic trading environment continues to be
challenging, characterised by constrained consumer spending,
intense competition and rising input cost inflation,” the
company said in a statement today. These factors, which have
been further stoked by volatile commodity prices and the rand’s
weakness “have affected the group’s performance and are likely
to persist for some time,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
