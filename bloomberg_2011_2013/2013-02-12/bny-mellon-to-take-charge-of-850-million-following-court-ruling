Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the
world’s largest custody bank, said it will take an after-tax
charge of $850 million after the U.S. Tax Court made a ruling on
the handling of foreign tax credits.  BNY Mellon expects to take the charge in the first quarter
of 2013 as a result of today’s decision, according to a
statement from the New York-based company. It will appeal the
court’s decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
