European finance chiefs told
Cyprus’s government that it must do more to combat money
laundering before it can hope to win an international bailout,
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said.  A gathering of European finance ministers in Brussels
conveyed the message “intensely” to their Cypriot colleague,
 Vassos Shiarly , that “they have to do some more to convince the
international community they not only have passed the money
laundering laws, but that they’ve also implemented them,”
Schaeuble told reporters today at the meeting’s end.  “It’s of decisive importance” that the Cypriot government
bring clarity on money laundering, Schaeuble said. “It was a
very intense debate and I hope that the Cyriot colleague has
understood that.”  Cyprus is still awaiting a decision on outside aid eight
months after it made a request, with some members of Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s government questioning the need to help the
Mediterranean island nation representing just 0.15 percent of
euro area output. Schaeuble’s ministry has said Cyprus isn’t
eligible for aid unless it threatens contagion and hence the
stability of the entire euro region.  In Europe, “we all fully agree that work on Cyprus has to
be driven forward,” Schaeuble said. “But on the other hand we
know that there are elections in Cyprus and that no decisions
can be taken before the election.”  Presidential elections are due to be held in Cyprus on Feb.
17, with a run-off on Feb. 24 if no candidate wins an outright
majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
