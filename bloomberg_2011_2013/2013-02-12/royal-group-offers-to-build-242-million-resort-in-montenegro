Montenegro may accept this week an
offer from Abu Dhabi’s Royal Group to develop a 180 million-euro
($242 million) resort on its Adriatic coast, the government
said.  The group is the only bidder for the 423,700-square meter
(105-acre) site between the cities of Budva and Bar, Dragan
Simovic, in charge of the sale at Montenegro’s Privatization
Council, said in a phone interview. The company is offering 21.2
million euros for the land and plans to complete the project in
eight years, he said.  A binding contract with the Royal Group may be signed in
May, pending the council’s approval, Simovic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
