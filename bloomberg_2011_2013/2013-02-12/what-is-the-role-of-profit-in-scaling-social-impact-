Chu has seen for-profit organizations deliver practical, effective solutions to major societal problems. In this interactive HBR webinar, leads a discussion focused on the role of private sector companies in delivering effective, high-impact solutions to pressing social problems. Chu shares specific examples where businesses have successfully responded to public sector failures and will describes why profitable approaches play a key role in addressing society's greatest challenges.
