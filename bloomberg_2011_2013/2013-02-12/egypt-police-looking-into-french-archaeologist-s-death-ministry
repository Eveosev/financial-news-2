Egyptian officials are searching for
two men possibly linked to the death of a French archaeologist
whose body was discovered in a Cairo apartment, the Giza
Security Directorate said in an e-mailed statement.  Michel Wuttmann, the 60-year-old director of the French
Institute for Oriental Archeology in Cairo, was found with
injuries around the mouth and signs of smothering, the security
division said.  There were no signs of forced entry into the apartment, and
authorities have identified two 18-year-old men who may be
linked to his death on Feb. 10, the statement said.  The institute expressed its condolences in a statement
posted on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
