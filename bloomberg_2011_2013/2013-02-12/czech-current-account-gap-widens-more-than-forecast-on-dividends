The Czech  current-account  deficit
widened more than analysts forecast in December as the outflow
of dividends increased, the central bank said.  The shortfall totaled 24.3 billion koruna ($1.3 billion),
compared with a gap of 2 billion koruna in November, the Prague-
based central bank said in a statement on its website today. The
reading compared with a median  forecast  of a 13 billion-koruna
deficit in a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts.  Dividend payments from direct investments in the Czech
Republic totaled 21.3 billion koruna in December, compared with
10.9 billion in the previous month, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
