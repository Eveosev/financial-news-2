Australian  consumer confidence 
surged by the most since September 2011 as interest-rate cuts
gain traction, sending the local currency higher as traders
boosted bets the central bank will hold rates steady next month.  The sentiment index for February jumped 7.7 percent to
108.3, a Westpac Banking Corp. and Melbourne Institute survey
taken Feb. 4-8 of 1,200 adults showed today in Sydney. That was
the strongest reading since December 2010 and the fourth-
straight figure above 100 that indicates optimists outnumber
pessimists.  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his
board lowered the benchmark rate to 3 percent on Dec. 4,
matching the level reached from April-October 2009 that was the
lowest since 1960. The central bank, which paused this month, is
seeking to rebalance growth and extend 21 recession-free years
as a mining investment boom is predicted to peak in 2013.  “The more positive February reading suggests lower
interest rates may finally be starting to gain more traction
with the consumer,” said  Bill Evans , Westpac’s chief economist.
“Housing markets continued to show signs of recovery.”  The local dollar rose after the report, trading at $1.0338
at 10:51 a.m. in Sydney, from $1.0308 before the data. Traders
are pricing in a 42 percent chance policy makers will lower the
overnight cash rate target by a quarter-percentage point to a
record-low 2.75 percent at their meeting next month, down from
52 percent before the release, swaps data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  House Prices  Australian house prices rose last quarter by the most since
June 2010 as lower rates lured buyers back into the market. The
nation’s benchmark stock index rose 4.9 percent last month.  In contrast, government data last week showed Australian
retail sales unexpectedly fell for a third month in December,
the longest stretch of declines in 13 years. Australian
employers added part-time jobs in January and fewer people
hunted for work, helping keep the unemployment rate unchanged at
5.4 percent, government data showed Feb. 7.  “We continue to see the case for lower rates as strong and
expect the RBA to cut rates by another 25 basis points at its
March meeting,” Evans said. “Today’s report will be an
important input to policy deliberations but should not divert
the board from other evidence around the economy’s momentum and
prospects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
