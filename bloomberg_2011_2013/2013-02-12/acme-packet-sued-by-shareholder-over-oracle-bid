Acme Packet Inc . was sued by an
investor claiming that  Oracle Corp .’s $2.1 billion takeover bid
for the company is too low.  Acme directors  breached their fiduciary duty to
shareholders by agreeing to provisions that restrain other
bidders, Willard Love said in a complaint filed today in
Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington.  “Given Acme’s future growth prospects, the consideration
shareholders will receive is inadequate and undervalues the
company,” Love said in the complaint. “Oracle is seeking to
acquire the company at a most opportune time, at a time when the
company is still suffering setbacks from a temporary stall in
the telecom market.”  Oracle, the second-largest maker of business applications,
said Feb. 4 that it would pay $29.25 a share in cash for
Bedford, Massachusetts-based Acme to gain networking gear that
helps corporations securely transmit information over the
Internet.  Acme’s tools to transmit voice and video via the Web may
help Oracle challenge Cisco Systems Inc. in networking.
Excluding Acme’s cash, Oracle is paying $1.7 billion. The offer
is more than six times Acme’s sales during the past 12 months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Love seeks to represent all Acme shareholders in his bid to
block the deal and is requesting unspecified damages.  Mike O’Malley, a spokesman for Acme Packet, declined to
comment on the complaint.  The case is Love v. Ory CA8303, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
