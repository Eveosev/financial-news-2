Tokyo Electric Power Co . purchased
15 percent more fuel oil in January than a year ago to run
thermal-power plants that are providing a greater share of the
nation’s energy since the Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The utility known as Tepco bought 756,000 kiloliters, or
153,000 barrels a day, of fuel oil last month, up from 656,000
kiloliters a year ago, according to data released today on its
 website .  Tepco’s coal purchases rose 6 percent to 250,000 metric
tons last month from a year ago, the company said. Liquefied
natural gas imports declined 3 percent to 2.15 million tons,
while crude buying dipped 0.6 percent.  All but two of Japan’s 50 functioning nuclear reactors are
offline for safety checks after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.
Tepco, Japan’s biggest utility, has operated no nuclear reactors
since it halted the No. 6 unit at its Kashiwazaki Kariwa atomic
station in northwest Japan’s Niigata prefecture in March 2012.  The following table shows Tepco’s consumption and purchases
of fuel oil, crude, LNG and coal for January. For fuel oil and
crude, the volume is in kiloliters while LNG and coal are in
metric tons.
