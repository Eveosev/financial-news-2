The zloty retreated for a second day
as a report this week may show inflation slowed for the fourth
consecutive month, giving Poland’s central bank more leeway to
cut interest rates.  The zloty is the worst-performing emerging-market currency
from Europe this year as the country’s economy weakens and
interest rates were cut by a total of 100 basis points since
November. Poland’s  inflation  rate probably slowed to 2 percent
in January, the lowest since August 2010, from 2.4 percent in
December, according to a median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of 30 economists before the data are published on Feb. 15.  “The zloty may stay under pressure today,”  Szilvia Laszlo , an emerging-market economist at DZ Bank AG, said in e-
mailed report today. “Inflation may stay low and economic
growth is decelerating.”  The zloty depreciated 0.3 percent to 4.1671 per euro at
1:44 p.m. in Warsaw, extending this year’s decline to 2.1
percent, compared with a 0.8 weakening by the Czech koruna and
less than 0.1 percent appreciation by Hungary’s forint. The
yield on Poland’s 10-year notes denomiated in zloty rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.07 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
