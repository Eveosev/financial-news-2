A Russian weightlifter who won
bronze at the Athens Olympics in 2004 was disqualified for
doping after tests of his stored sample found a prohibited
substance, Games organizers said.  Oleg Perepetchenov will have to return his medal for the
77-kilo event, the International Olympic Committee said today in
an e-mailed statement.  The IOC stores samples for eight years after an event so
they can be re-tested should more sophisticated technology be
developed or new substances be added to the banned list. The IOC
didn’t say what type of specimen was tested.  “The IOC, in close collaboration with the World Anti-
Doping Agency, decided to further analyze a number of samples
from the Athens Games as a result of targeted testing based on
intelligence and new methods,” the governing body said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
