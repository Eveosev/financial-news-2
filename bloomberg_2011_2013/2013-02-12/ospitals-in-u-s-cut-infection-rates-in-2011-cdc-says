U.S. hospitals reduced some types of
deadly and costly infections in 2011, three years after a
government initiative to cut hospital-acquired illnesses.  Infections stemming from catheters placed in a large vein
in the neck, chest or groin to give medication or collect blood
declined 41 percent from 2008, the  Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention  said today in a report. Infections following
surgery decreased 17 percent since 2008, the CDC said.  The Department of Health and Human Services set a goal in
2008 of reducing the catheter or central line-associated
bloodstream infections by 50 percent and surgical site
infections by 25 percent, the CDC said in a  statement . About 1
in 20 patients gets infected each year while receiving medical
care, including 41,000 bloodstream infections that strike
hospital patients with catheters, the Atlanta-based health
agency said.  “Reductions in some of the deadliest health care-
associated infections are encouraging, especially when you
consider the costs to both patients and the health care
system,” CDC Director  Thomas Frieden  said in the statement.  CDC uses data from its National Healthcare Safety Network,
which collects information from more than 11,500 health-care
facilities in the 50 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.  The data showed hospitals improved their procedures,
reducing catheter-associated bloodstream and surgical site
infections at a faster rate than in 2010. In 2010, catheter
infections decreased 32 percent from 2008 while surgical site
infections declined 7 percent.  Hospitals made a 7 percent reduction in catheter-associated
urinary tract infections from 2009, the same percentage as
reported in 2010, CDC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
