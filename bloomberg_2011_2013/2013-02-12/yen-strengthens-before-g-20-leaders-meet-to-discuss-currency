The euro strengthened for a third
day against the dollar after a report showed industrial
production in the 17-nation region increased more in December
than economists forecast.  The common currency appreciated against 13 of its 16 major
counterparts as the data added to signs the debt crisis is
easing and Europe is emerging from recession. The pound slumped
after the Bank of England said risks to the U.K.’s economic
recovery are weighted to the downside. Sweden’s krona rallied
after the central bank kept interest rates unchanged.  “Market appetite for the euro has improved,” said Neil
Jones, head of European Hedge Fund Sales at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. in London. “The situation in the euro zone has
gradually improved along with the outlook for the global
economy. We expect the euro’s upward momentum to continue.”  The euro appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.3479 per dollar as
of 6:13 a.m. in New York after rising to $1.3711 on Feb. 1, the
highest level since November 2011. The shared currency gained
0.5 percent to 126.36 yen. The yen dropped 0.3 percent to 93.75
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
