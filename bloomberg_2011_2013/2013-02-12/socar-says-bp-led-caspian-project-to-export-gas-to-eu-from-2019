The  BP Plc -led Shah Deniz Phase Two
natural-gas project in Azerbaijan’s section of the Caspian Sea
will start production in 2018 and deliver the fuel to the
European Union in 2019, the state energy company said.  Partners in the project that also include State Oil Co. of
Azerbaijan will make the final investment decision in October,
 Elshad Nasirov , vice-president of the Baku-based producer known
as Socar, said today in the Azeri capital.  London-based BP spokesman  Toby Odone  confirmed that they’re
trying to have the first gas in 2018.  EU nations are seeking to diversify their sources of gas to
curb dependence on Russian deliveries, which have been disrupted
several times en route through Ukraine. Gas from Shah Deniz,
will travel from Baku via the BP-led South Caucasus Pipeline to
Turkey’s border, where it will link up with the proposed Trans-
Anatolia Pipeline, or Tanap, for shipment to Europe.  Nasirov said Socar will spend $40 million to $45 million to
help develop the Nabucco West and TAP projects to take the fuel
to the EU from the Turkish border. Partners will choose between
the two in June, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
