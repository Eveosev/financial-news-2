Hermes International SCA  said 
2012 profitability reached a record level as sales rose 23 
percent, driven by  demand for its $10,000 Birkin bags in 
markets across the globe.  Revenue climbed to 3.48 billion euros ($4.66 billion), the
Paris-based company said today in a statement. The average of 17
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 3.42 billion euros.
Excluding currency swings, sales rose 16 percent. Hermes’s
forecast was for growth of more than 13 percent.  For 2012, “given the excellent performance in the fourth
quarter, the operating margin is expected to be slightly above
the all-time high achieved in 2011,” the company said.  Growth at the maker of Kelly bags is in contrast to larger
rival and Hermes stakeholder  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
SA , which last month reported stagnant growth at its fashion and
leather-goods unit. Hermes exerts more control over sales by
limiting the supply of its handbags amid strong demand,
according to Exane BNP Paribas analyst  Luca Solca .  “Hermes ends the year on a perfect note,” CA Cheuvreux
analyst  Thomas Mesmin  said in an e-mailed note today. The
expected profitability for the year is “remarkable,” he said.
Hermes previously expected operating margin to be between the
2010 level and the record high of 31.2 percent achieved in 2011.  Hermes shares rose as much as 1.9 percent in Paris and were
up 1 percent to 247.50 euros as of 9:09 a.m. in the French
capital.  While industry growth may not accelerate this year, the so-
called absolute luxury segment where Hermes competes is the
fastest-growing part of the market and will outperform the rest
until at least 2014, Bain & Co. estimates.  $10,000 Birkin  Hermes, which in November raised its forecast for 2012
organic revenue growth to more than 13 percent, has met or
exceeded its own annual sales target each year since at least
2007 as demand for products like its Birkin soars. The company
opened two new workshops last year in France due to
“persistently strong demand” as leather-goods sales rose 12
percent.  Revenue growth was driven by a sales increase of 25 percent
in Asia, excluding Japan, as the retailer opened new stores and
expanded existing ones, Hermes said. Revenue rose 15 percent in
Europe and gained 14 percent in the Americas, the company said.  Perfume Revenue  Silk-and-textiles sales grew 16 percent, while ready-to-
wear and fashion accessories surged 22 percent.  Perfume revenue 
climbed 14 percent, while watch sales advanced 17 percent. Other
products, including jewelry, increased 45 percent, Hermes said.  Fourth-quarter sales advanced 23 percent to 1.04 billion
euros, Hermes said. Analysts predicted 995.8 million euros.
Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 178 million euros
on sales in 2012, the company said.  “Hermes posted very solid fourth-quarter sales,”  Leopold Authie , a Paris-based analyst at Oddo & Cie., said by e-mail,
adding that he will “revise up” his expectations for the year.  Hermes, a maker of silk scarves, will pay an interim
dividend of 1.50 euros per share on March 1, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
