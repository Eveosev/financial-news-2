India’s rupee fell to the lowest
level in more than three weeks after central bank Governor
 Duvvuri Subbarao  said the nation’s current-account deficit is
set to widen from a record. Bonds declined.  The shortfall in the fiscal year through March is expected
to be “significantly higher” than the previous period’s 4.2
percent of gross domestic product, Subbarao said in Mumbai
yesterday. The rupee may become more vulnerable to the deficit
should fund inflows into Indian stocks slow, according to IDBI
Federal Life Insurance Co. Foreigners bought a net $3.3 billion
of local stocks this month through Feb. 8, exchange data show.  “Currently, the rupee is only supported by inflows,” said
 Aneesh Srivastava , chief investment officer in Mumbai at IDBI
Federal. “Any sort of risk aversion will cause outflows and hit
the currency hard.”  The rupee declined 0.1 percent to 53.9250 per dollar as of
9:35 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 54.0125 earlier, the lowest level since Jan. 18. One-
month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 9.23 percent. Markets in China, Hong
Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia are closed today for the
Lunar New Year holiday.  Group-of-Seven nations are considering releasing a
statement on exchange rates this week to calm concern that the
world is on the brink of a currency war, three officials from
the countries said. The international finance group is looking
to release it before the G-20 meeting in Moscow.  Factory Output  India’s  industrial production  grew 1 percent in December
from a year earlier, after contracting 0.1 percent the previous
month, according to the median of 29 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey before data due 11 a.m. in New Delhi today.  Inflation probably slowed to a three-year low of 6.97
percent in January, another Bloomberg survey showed before data
due Feb. 14. The pace of price gains, which was 7.18 percent in
December, is still high, Governor Subbarao said yesterday.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 was 7.87
percent today, compared with 7.86 percent yesterday, according
to the central bank’s trading system.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.97 per
dollar, compared with 54.72 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.73 versus 54.61. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
