Peruvian sol-denominated bonds rose,
pushing down yields the most in four days, as investors bought
short-dated notes that they expect to benefit from appreciation
in the local currency.  The yield on the nation’s 9.91 percent debt due May 2015
decreased three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to a
record 1.51 percent at 3:24 p.m. in Lima. The price climbed 0.03
centimo to 118.22 centimos per sol.  Dollar inflows have risen amid increased demand for the
Andean nation’s bonds and as Peruvian companies seek financing
overseas, prompting authorities to bolster efforts to stem
appreciation in the sol. The local currency, which appreciated
5.4 percent in 2012, has dropped 0.8 percent this year after the
central bank stepped up its purchases of greenbacks and
increased banks’ reserve requirements, making it cheaper for
dollar-based investors to buy sol bonds.  “The currency’s long-term appreciatory trend is expected
to resume shortly,” said  Walther Benavides , a bond trader at
Banco Continental SA in Lima. “If it’s a bet on the sol, the
most logical thing to do is buy short-dated bonds with little
interest rate risk.”  Non-resident investors accounted for 88 percent of all
holdings of the 2015 notes as of Dec. 31, compared with 52
percent a year earlier, according to the Finance Ministry.  The sol gained 0.4 percent to 2.5707 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, a two-week high, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. Its 4.4 percent appreciation in the last 12 months is
the biggest among Latin America’s six most-traded currencies.  The central bank said on its website it bought $60 million
in the currency market today, taking its purchases this year to
$2.7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
