Canadian  stocks  fluctuated between
gains and losses, after reaching a 19-month high yesterday, as
the nation’s trade deficit narrowed to its lowest level in
almost a year on higher crude exports.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil producer, rose 1.3
percent as the price of crude increased. Teck Resources Ltd.,
the country’s largest diversified miner, climbed 0.4 percent as
metals gained. Nordion Inc., a medical imaging technology
manufacturer, advanced 2.3 percent after an analyst with RBC
Capital Markets raised his rating for the stock.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 9.91 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 12,841.87 at 10:26 a.m. in Toronto. The
S&P/TSX has risen 3.3 percent this year. The benchmark average
closed yesterday at its highest level since July 2011.  Canada recorded a trade  deficit  of C$237 million ($230
million) in January, narrower than a revised December shortfall
of C$332 million, Statistics  Canada  said today. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the deficit would be C$600
million, based on the median of 20 estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
