Russian (INDEXCF)  stocks reversed gains as OAO
Novatek’s declined on lower-than-estimated profit outweighed
better-than-expected U.S. jobs data.  The 50-stock Micex Index closed little changed at 1,491.73
with 25 stocks rising and 25 stocks falling. Novatek  slipped  2.2
percent to 311.06 rubles, extending its streak of weekly
decreases to six. Russian markets are closed tomorrow.  Novatek, a private Russia gas producer, reported 69.5
billion rubles ($2.3 billion) net income in 2012 compared with a
71.3 billion ruble average estimate from analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The Micex sell-off into the close was driven almost by
entirely by Novatek, whose fourth quarter results missed market
expectations,” Joseph Dayan, head of markets at BCS Financial
Group, said by e-mail.  The Micex got support from the U.S. stock market, where the
 Dow Jones index rose to another record high, as the number of
people who filed for unemployment benefits fell to a six-week
low, showing further improvement in the labor market.  Rosneft climbed for a fourth day, its longest streak of
gains in more than a month, to 248.08 rubles. The company agreed
to buy a 30 percent stake in an Exxon Mobil project for an
undisclosed amount to explore 20 deep-water blocks in the Gulf
of Mexico, according to an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Arctic Exploration  BP Plc is open to looking at future Arctic exploration with
Rosneft, BP Chief Executive Officer Robert Dudley said in a
Bloomberg TV interview.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, lost 0.3 percent by 7:28 p.m. in
Moscow to $29.00. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in the stock futures, decreased 0.6 percent to
20.18.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21  emerging markets  tracked by
Bloomberg.  The Micex trades at about  5.6 times  estimated earnings
after gaining 1.5 percent this year. That compares with a
multiple of 10.7 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and
an increase of 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
