Middle-distillate inventories in
 Singapore , Asia’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
8.8 percent to the lowest level in 15 weeks, according to a unit
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene declined 910,000 barrels to 9.4 million barrels in the
seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the lowest level since
the week ended Nov. 21.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels  including fuel oil and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen were down 1.8 million
barrels, or 8.3 percent, at 20 million, the ministry’s data
showed. That’s the biggest drop since the week to Dec. 12.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate slid 641,000 barrels, or 6 percent, to 10 million
barrels, according to the data. Stockpiles decreased for the
fifth week in six.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
