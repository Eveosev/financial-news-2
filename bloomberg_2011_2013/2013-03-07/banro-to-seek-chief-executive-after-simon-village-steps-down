Banro Corp. (BAA) , a Canadian gold miner
active in the Democratic Republic of Congo, fell the most in
three months after it said Chief Executive Officer Simon Village
stepped down.  Banro dropped 9.7 percent to C$2.05 at 10:37 a.m. in
Toronto.  The shares  earlier tumbled 11 percent, the most
intraday since Nov. 20.  John Clarke, a Banro director since 2004, will take over as
interim CEO, the Toronto-based company said in a statement
released after the close of regular trading yesterday. The
company didn’t give a reason for Village’s departure.  Gold miners such as  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  and  Newmont Mining
Corp. (NEM)  are facing slumping share prices and rising expenses.
Barrick, the world’s biggest gold producer, replaced its CEO
last June and at least five more heads of North American
producers announced their departures or lost their jobs last
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
