Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) , the Brazilian maker
of more than 190 consumer products from diapers to generic
drugs, rose to the highest since May 2011 after quarterly profit
beat estimates as sales of  consumer goods  boosted revenue.  Shares rallied 2.8 percent to 18.10 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo. The benchmark Bovespa index gained 1.6
percent.  Adjusted net income climbed to 124.7 million reais ($63.7
million) in the fourth quarter from 49.6 million reais a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg after the
company released results today. The average forecast of five
analysts was 90.1 million reais.  Those were “solid” results “on the still-strong pace of
pharma sales and at last a significant improvement in the growth
of consumer goods,” Juliana Rozenbaum and Vitor Paschoal,
analysts at Itau BBA, wrote in a research note to clients today.  Sales jumped 62 percent to 1.03 billion reais in the fourth
quarter. That compares with an average estimate of 1.02 billion
reais of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hypermarcas gained 8.9 percent this year, while the Bovespa
fell 3.5 percent in that period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
