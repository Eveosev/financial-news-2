Gasoline fluctuated as crude rallied
after U.S. jobless claims fell and the dollar weakened, while
East Coast motor fuel inventories increased.  Futures swung between gains and losses as applications for
 unemployment benefits  slid to a six-week low in the seven days
ended March 2, according to data from the Labor Department. The
dollar fell against the euro after the  European Central Bank 
left  interest rates  at a record low. The Energy Information
Administration said yesterday that East Coast stockpiles
increased and imports jumped, easing immediate supply concern.  “The jobless claims numbers were good, giving the market a
little bit of a boost, and the dollar has been showing some
weakness,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in Chicago. “What’s keeping the market anchored
is we are well-supplied in the U.S.”  April-delivery gasoline fell 0.41 cent to $3.1206 a gallon
at 10:43 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after trading
between $3.0976 and $3.1389. Trading volume was 38 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day.  Initial jobless claims fell by 7,000 to 340,000 last week.
The dollar slipped 0.9 percent against the euro at 10:53 a.m. in
New York.  Crude oil for April delivery gained as much as 1.4 percent
to $91.43 a barrel on the exchange.  Heating oil for March delivery rose 0.63 cent to $2.9819 a
gallon on trading volume that was 16 percent above the 100-day
average for the time of day.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.8 cent to
$3.727 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. It was the
eighth consecutive drop.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
