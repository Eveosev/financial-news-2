EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) , the largest oil
producer in  Texas ’ Eagle Ford shale, said it’s pursuing new
projects to bolster its rising U.S. onshore liquids output.  “We don’t need to find another big thing, but we’re
looking,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Papa said
yesterday in an interview at the IHS CERAWeek energy conference
in Houston. Still, “we’d be very successful even if we were
unsuccessful at finding something new.”  The next steps for the company are prioritizing its
inventory of drilling acreage and continuing to execute its
projects as it becomes a larger company and seeks to boost how
much oil it can recover, Papa said.  Earlier yesterday, Papa told attendees at the conference
the U.S. may not have another oil-dominated project the size of
the Eagle Ford or the Bakken in  North Dakota  that would be
economic at current  price levels . There are probably more new
resources to be found in  North America  that will have a
combination of oil, natural gas liquids and gas, he said.  EOG President William Thomas, who is slated to replace Papa
as CEO in mid-2013 and as chairman at the end of the year, will
be a “natural fit” to take over after being groomed for a
couple years, Papa said.  EOG doesn’t envision being part of a big industry merger or
acquisition.  “We don’t have a for-sale sign on our door,” Papa said.  EOG’s stock has climbed about 37 percent since the end of
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
