South African business confidence
declined from a five-month high in February as economic growth
remains subdued and the rand weakened, the South African Chamber
of Commerce and Industry said.  The  index  dropped to 93 from 94 in January, the
Johannesburg-based chamber said in an e-mailed statement today.
The measure is compiled from 13 economic indicators, including
retail sales,  inflation  and financial gauges, such as a stock-
market index and currency.  “It is troubling that the financial environment appears to
be restricting an already uncertain business mood,” the chamber
said. “The continued weakening of the rand is of special
concern.”  The Reserve Bank has held benchmark borrowing costs at the
lowest  level  in more than 30 years to help stimulate an economy
that expanded 2.5 percent last year, the slowest pace since a
recession in 2009. The rand has dropped 6.8 percent against the
dollar this year, the worst performer of 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, making imports more expensive
and pushing the trade deficit to a record.  The central bank cut its forecast for growth to 2.6 percent
this year from a previous 2.9 percent, as demand for
manufactured goods from  Europe  remains weak. The rand is the
biggest risk to inflation,  Reserve Bank  Governor Gill Marcus
said in January.  Growth in  manufacturing , which accounts for about 15
percent of the economy, slowed to 2 percent in December, the
slowest pace since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
