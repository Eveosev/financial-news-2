The global wheat harvest may climb
4.3 percent from the previous season, reaching the second-
highest on record, as European farmers expanded acreage while
yields rebound in  Russia , the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture
Organization said.  World output may total 690 million metric tons this year,
compared with 661.8 million tons a year earlier, the Rome-based
FAO said today in an online  report . The harvest would be second
only to the 2011 record. Wheat planting in the European Union
may be about 3 percent bigger than a year earlier and weather
conditions have been “generally favorable.” Ukraine may also
see a “large recovery” in output after satisfactory winter
conditions, the FAO said. Russia and eastern  Europe  had dry
weather last year.  “We should have a season ahead of us that could be in a
little more comfortable balance than the season in 2012-13,”
 Abdolreza Abbassian , an economist at the FAO, said in a phone
interview before the report. Russia and former Soviet Union
countries “had a particularly bad year in 2012, so the
expectation is that they will have a recovery. The weather
situation has been better so far.”  Wheat futures rose as much as 0.9 percent today to $6.8975
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, before paring gains. The
price slid to an eight-month low yesterday. Wheat, the best
performing commodity in 2012 in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge
of 24 raw materials, is down 12 percent in 2013. In Paris,
milling wheat has dropped 7 percent this year on NYSE Liffe.  Russia Rebounds  Russia may  harvest  53 million tons of wheat, up 39 percent
from production of 38 million tons in 2012, the FAO said. Output
in Ukraine may jump 23 percent to 19.5 million tons and
 Kazakhstan ’s crop may surge 48 percent to 15.2 million tons.
Production in the EU may climb 4.5 percent to 138 million tons.  China and Pakistan may have record wheat crops in 2013, at
121.4 million tons and 24.7 million tons, respectively, the FAO
said.  India ’s crop was pegged at 92.3 million tons, 2.7 percent
smaller than the record 94.9 million tons harvested in 2012.  Production in the U.S., the world’s largest wheat exporter,
may drop by 6.1 percent to 58 million tons because of drought in
the southern Great Plains.  Australia  also faces uncertainty
before planting begins in April because hot weather has reduced
soil moisture. The UN still pegged the country’s crop at 23
million tons, up 4.1 percent from 2012.  South America  Corn production in  Brazil ’s first-season crop may rise 9
percent this year because of ample rainfall, allowing planting
of the second-season crop to progress under favorable moisture
conditions, the FAO said.  Argentina ’s crop may rise to a record
25.5 million tons as yields recover from drought in the previous
season, making up for an 8 percent drop in planting. More rain
is needed in the country to maintain yields.  Corn production in  South Africa  may be near a record at
more than 13 million tons, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
