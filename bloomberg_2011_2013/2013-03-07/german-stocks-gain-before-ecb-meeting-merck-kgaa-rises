German stocks  rose to their highest
in more than five years as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  maintained his view that the euro-area economy will
gradually recover later this year, even as policy makers reduced
their economic and inflation forecasts.  Merck KGaA (MRK)  rose to the highest price since its October 1995
initial public offering after the drugmaker reported profit that
beat analyst estimates. Adidas AG increased to the highest since
1995 after its 2013 forecast outweighed a loss for the fourth
quarter. Continental AG gained to its highest in more than five
years after keeping its prediction for sales to increase this
year even as the region’s auto market dropped in the first
quarter more than expected.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  increased 0.3 percent to 7,939.77 at the
close of trading in  Frankfurt , its highest level since January
2008. The equity benchmark has  gained 4.3 percent  this year as
U.S. lawmakers agreed on a budget avoiding automatic fiscal
changes that had threatened to push the world’s biggest economy
into a recession. The broader HDAX Index rose 0.3 percent today.  “The market had expected a little bit more from Draghi
today, but the picture for equity markets is fairly bright,”
Matthias Jasper, head of equities at WGZ Bank AG in Dusseldorf,
said in a phone interview. “The signs are set for continued
policy easing. Also, we have a continued recovery in the U.S.,
which gives strong support for other markets after the massive
bullish signal with the Dow reaching new all-time highs.”  U.S. Growth  The  U.S. economy , the world’s largest, grew at a modest to
moderate pace across most of the country amid rising consumer
demand for homes and autos, the  Federal Reserve  said late
yesterday in its Beige Book business survey. The assessment
helped push the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  to a record high.  The ECB today predicted the 17-nation economy will shrink
0.5 percent this year, more than the 0.3 percent contraction
forecast three months ago. The central bank lowered its 2014
inflation projection to 1.3 percent from 1.4 percent.  “Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover,
supported by a strengthening global backdrop and our
accommodative monetary policy stance,” Draghi told a press
conference in Frankfurt after policy makers left their benchmark
 interest rate  at 0.75 percent, a record low.  The  Bank of England  left its four-year-old bond-purchase
program unchanged today as policy makers debate more radical
measures to aid the recovery. The BOE kept its  key interest rate 
at a record-low 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009.  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 21 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Merck Profit  Merck advanced 2.9 percent to 112.20 euros. The maker of
the cancer drug Erbitux said profit rose to 789.8 million euros
($1.03 billion) in the fourth quarter, higher than the 768.9
million-euro median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Adidas, which reported a 272 million-euro net loss for the
fourth quarter, added 6.6 percent to 76.38 euros, the highest
price since its November 1995 share sale. The owner of the
Reebok brand said sales will increase at a “mid-single-digit”
percentage pace in 2013. The company also proposed a dividend of
1.35 euros a share, a 35 percent increase from last year.  “We are well positioned to again achieve record sales in
2013,” Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Hainer  said in a
statement. “2013 will also see a step change in the pace of
operating margin expansion. And this, in turn, will lead to
another year of double-digit earnings growth.”  Continental Forecast  Continental climbed 4.4 percent to 98 euros, its highest
price since November 2007.  Europe ’s second-largest tiremaker
forecast revenue will rise about 5 percent to more than 34
billion euros this year.  Hannover Re  gained 2.6 percent to 62.81 euros, its highest
price since at least January 1997. The world’s fourth-largest
reinsurer proposed a record dividend of 2.60 euros a share plus
a bonus of 40 cents a share, from 2.10 euros a year ago, after
profit rose to the highest in the company’s history.  Lanxess AG (LXS)  dropped 4.6 percent to 63.81 euros. The chemical
maker that joined the DAX in September said it will idle a
factory in Belgium and another in the U.S.  The factory closures, which will be implemented in the
coming weeks, are a reaction to “soft” underlying demand,
which has continued into 2013 across most businesses, the
company said.  Lanxess earlier said fourth-quarter profit rose 37 percent
after it exercised “strict cost discipline.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
