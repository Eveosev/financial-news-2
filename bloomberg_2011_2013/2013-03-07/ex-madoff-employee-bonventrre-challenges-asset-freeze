A longtime employee of Bernard L. Madoff challenged the government’s freeze on his assets,
claiming it interferes with his ability to pay his defense
costs.  A lawyer for Daniel Bonventre today asked a federal appeals
court to dissolve a freeze on his client’s assets or at least to
order a lower court to hold a hearing on the matter. The lawyer,
Andrew Frisch, argued to a three-judge panel of the  U.S. Court
of Appeals  in  New York  that the freeze is preventing Bonventre
from paying to defend himself in a case growing out of the
biggest fraud in U.S. history.  Bonventre, who worked for Madoff for 40 years, is charged
with 22 criminal counts. Frisch, a former federal prosecutor,
estimates Bonventre’s defense will cost at least $2.5 million.  “I can’t take a dime from him,” Frisch, a solo
practitioner, told the judges.  U.S. prosecutors claim Bonventre’s money is the proceeds of
crime and can’t be used to pay his defense team.  Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence for running the
biggest  Ponzi scheme .  The case is U.S. v. Bonventre, 12-3574, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
