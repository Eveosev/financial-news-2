Spanish 10-year bonds climbed for a
seventh day as borrowing costs fell at a debt sale and European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said data suggest the euro-
area economy will stabilize.  Spain ’s 10-year yields approached the lowest in more than a
year as the nation exceeded its target at an auction of
government debt. German bunds led losses among so-called core
markets as Draghi’s comments damped demand for safer assets. The
yield on  Portugal ’s five-year notes fell to the lowest level in
more than two years after  Standard & Poor’s  raised the country’s
credit-rating outlook.  “Overall Draghi has struck quite a positive tone, keeping
his accommodative stance, and the market is reacting to that,”
said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in London.  Spanish 10-year yields dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 4.90 percent at 4:44 p.m.  London  time. The
rate dropped to 4.84 percent on Jan. 11, the lowest level since
March 1, 2012. The 5.4 percent security due in January 2023 rose
0.865, or 8.65 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 103.875.  The ECB’s decision to hold its main  refinancing rate  at
0.75 percent was forecast by 56 of 61 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The rest predicted a cut to 0.5 percent.  ‘Gradually Recover’  Economic activity should “gradually recover” in 2013,
Draghi said at a press conference in  Frankfurt  after the rate
decision. Inflation risks are broadly balanced, he said.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield increased four basis points to
1.49 percent, and reached 1.51 percent, the most since Feb. 26.
Two-year note yields climbed five basis points to 0.085 percent.  Spain auctioned 5.03 billion euros of debt, compared with a
target of 5 billion euros. It allotted 2.44 billion euros of 10-
year bonds at an average yield of 4.917 percent, the lowest
since November 2010. It also sold 2015 and 2018 notes today.  Investors bid 2.27 times the amount of 2023 securities
sold, up from a so-called bid-to-cover of 1.60 last month.  “Spain slightly managed to overshoot the maximum target
range and this is something the market will cheer,” said
 Michael Leister , an interest-rates analyst at Commerzbank AG in
London. “At first glance it looks like a good auction.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German debt narrowed 15 basis
points to 340 basis points, after reaching 338 basis points, the
least since Feb. 25.  Portuguese Yields  Portuguese  five-year yields  slid 15 basis points to 4.68
percent, after falling to 4.65 percent, the lowest since
December 2010. The 10-year rate dropped 22 basis points to 5.93
percent, the least since Jan. 24.  “The outlook revision reflects additional evidence that
European institutions will continue to support Portugal’s
adjustment program, given the government’s commitment to
budgetary and structural reforms,” S&P said in a statement
released today.  Volatility on Portugal bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of  Italy  and  Finland , according to
measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and 10-
year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Draghi said the effect of Italy’s inconclusive election on
financial markets was limited as Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
economic reforms will survive the political impasse.  “After some excitement after the elections, markets have
now reverted back more or less to where they were before,”
Draghi said. “Much of the fiscal adjustment Italy went through
will continue going on automatic pilot.”  Italy’s 10-year bonds rose for a third day, pushing the
yield down six basis points to 4.60 percent.  Spanish debt returned 3.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Portuguese
securities gained 2.2 percent, while German bunds handed
investors a loss of 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
