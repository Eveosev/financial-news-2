Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the auto lender
majority-owned by the U.S., disputed results of the Federal
Reserve’s stress tests, calling the analysis “fundamentally
flawed.”  “The analysis is inconsistent with historical experience
in the most-stressed periods in our business,” the Detroit-
based lender said in a statement today.  Loss assumptions for automotive finance are “implausible,
even in dire economic situations,” and Ally has strong capital
levels and ample liquidity to support vehicle financing, the
company said. The Fed could convert $5.9 billion into Tier 1
common equity at its own discretion, according the statement.  Ally benefited from more than $17 billion in U.S. bailouts
during the financial crisis and plans to repay the funds by
staging an initial public offering. Chief Executive Officer
Michael Carpenter has put the idea on hold until after the fate
of its bankrupt Residential Capital mortgage business is clear.
The U.S. owns 74 percent of Ally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
