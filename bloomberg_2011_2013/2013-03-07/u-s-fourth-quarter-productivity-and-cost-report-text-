The following is the text of the U.S.
productivity and costs report for the fourth quarter released
by the Labor Department.  Productivity and Costs  Fourth Quarter and Annual Averages 2012, Revised  Nonfarm business sector labor productivity decreased at a 1.9 percent 
annual rate during the fourth quarter of 2012, the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reported today. The decrease in productivity reflects increases 
of 0.5 percent in output and 2.5 percent in hours worked. (All quarterly 
percent changes in this release are seasonally adjusted annual rates.) 
From the fourth quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2012, 
productivity increased 0.5 percent as output and hours worked increased 
2.5 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively.  Annual average productivity
increased 0.7 percent from 2011 to 2012.   Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by dividing an index 
of real output by an index of hours worked of all persons, including 
employees, proprietors, and unpaid family workers. The measures released 
today were based on more recent source data than were available for the 
preliminary report.  Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses increased 4.6 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2012, the combined effect of the 1.9 percent decrease in 
productivity and a 2.6 percent increase in hourly compensation. Unit labor 
costs rose 2.1 percent over the last four quarters.    BLS defines unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly compensation to labor 
productivity; increases in hourly compensation tend to increase unit labor 
costs and increases in output per hour tend to reduce them.  ==============================================================================
Data in this release reflect the annual benchmark revision of BLS Current 
Employment Statistics program data on nonfarm employment and hours, and 
the revised seasonal adjustment of those data. More detail can be found in 
tables 1 through 6 and appendix tables 1 through 6. See Revised measures.
==============================================================================  Manufacturing sector productivity increased 2.1 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2012, as output increased 2.5 percent and hours increased 0.4 
percent. Productivity increased 2.7 percent in the durable goods sector 
and increased 1.7 percent in the nondurable goods sector. Over the last 
four quarters, manufacturing productivity increased 1.8 percent, as output 
increased 3.3 percent and hours worked rose 1.4 percent. Unit labor costs 
in manufacturing decreased 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 
increased 2.3 percent from the same quarter a year ago.  The concepts, sources, and methods used for the manufacturing and 
nonfinancial corporate output series differ from those used in the 
business and nonfarm business output series; these output measures are not 
directly comparable. See Technical Notes for a more detailed explanation.  Revised measures  Quarterly and annual measures of hours and related series including 
productivity for all sectors were revised back to 1990 to incorporate 
revised Current Employment Statistics program data published February 1, 
2013.  The data were subject to revision from 2008 forward as a result of 
annual benchmarking of establishment survey data and revised seasonal 
adjustment of those data, and from 1990 to 2008 due to other minor 
revisions. All index measures related to hours show historical revisions 
because the 2005 base year values were revised; resulting revisions to 
percent changes are small. Third quarter, fourth quarter, and annual 
average data for 2012 were also revised for regular updates of source data 
on output and compensation. Revised and previous measures for the third 
and fourth quarters of 2012 are shown in table B for the business, nonfarm 
business, and manufacturing sectors. Revised annual average measures for 
2008 to 2012 are shown in table C for the nonfarm business and 
manufacturing sectors. Revised third quarter measures for the nonfinancial 
corporate sector are shown in table D. Quarterly and annual data for all 
sectors appear in tables 1-6 for 2010 through 2012, and in appendix tables 
1-6 for 2008 and 2009. Full historical annual and quarterly measures can 
be found on the labor productivity and costs home page at 
 http://www.bls.gov/lpc/#data .   In the fourth quarter of 2012, nonfarm business productivity declined 1.9 
percent, as output was revised upward slightly more than hours. Unit labor 
costs rose 4.6 percent, about the same as the preliminary estimate. 
Manufacturing productivity growth was revised upward, to 2.1 percent, 
reflecting an upward revision to output that was larger than an upward 
revision to hours.  Due to both the upward revision to productivity and a 
downward revision to hourly compensation, manufacturing unit labor costs 
fell 1.9 percent, rather than rising 0.4 percent as reported in the 
preliminary release.   In the third quarter of 2012, nonfarm business productivity growth was 
little changed, at 3.1 percent, reflecting a slight upward revision to 
hours. However, unit labor costs decreased 1.9 percent rather than falling 
2.3 percent as reported February 7, due to an upward revision to hourly 
compensation and the slight downward revision to productivity. In the 
manufacturing sector, productivity was not revised in the third quarter. 
Unit labor costs increased less than previously reported due to a downward 
revision to hourly compensation.    Annual Average productivity growth for 2012 in the nonfarm business sector 
was revised down slightly to 0.7 percent, due to an upward revision to 
hours worked. The 2.2 percent increase in hours was the largest since a 
similar gain in 2006. The upward revision to hours also led to a downward 
revision to compensation per hour.  The increase of 1.4 percent in hourly 
compensation is the smallest in the annual series which begins in 1948 
except for another 1.4 percent increase in 2009. Real hourly compensation, 
which also takes into account changes in consumer prices, decreased 0.6 
percent in 2012 in the nonfarm business sector, the same as the decline in 
2011. Nonfarm business unit labor costs rose 0.7 percent in 2012, as 
previously reported.    Manufacturing sector productivity grew 2.2 percent in 2012, reflecting a 
4.5 percent increase in output combined with a 2.3 percent increase in 
hours. The increase in hours worked was the largest since 1994, and 
follows a 2.1 percent increase in 2011. Unit labor costs were revised 
downward to 0.0 percent in the manufacturing sector.   ____________
