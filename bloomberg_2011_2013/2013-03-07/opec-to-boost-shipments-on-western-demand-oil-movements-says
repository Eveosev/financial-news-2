The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will raise shipments this month in
anticipation of a rebound in demand as refiners in the U.S. and
Europe finish maintenance, according to Oil Movements.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will bolster crude shipments by 420,000 barrels a day, or 1.8
percent, to 23.83 million barrels a day in the four weeks to
March 23, the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The
figures exclude Angola and  Ecuador . Most of the increase is
coming from OPEC’s largest member,  Saudi Arabia .  “The maintenance season will be coming to an end and long-
haul crude setting off will meet the upturn when refinery runs
start to move up again,”  Roy Mason , the company’s founder, said
by phone from Halifax,  England . “This month it’s going west.”  Middle East shipments will increase by 2.1 percent to 17.48
million barrels a day in the period, compared with 17.12 million
in the four weeks to Feb. 23, according to Oil Movements. That
figure includes non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will average 471 million barrels, up
3.2 percent on the previous period, the data show. Oil Movements
calculates the volumes by tallying tanker bookings. Its figures
exclude crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC comprises Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and  Venezuela . The organization is next scheduled to
meet in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
