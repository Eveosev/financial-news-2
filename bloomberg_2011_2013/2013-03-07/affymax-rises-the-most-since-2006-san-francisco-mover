Affymax Inc. (AFFY)  rose the most ever in
New York trading, about 10 days after the drugmaker recalled its
anemia treatment Omontys because of reports three people had
fatal reactions to the medicine.  Affymax  rose  54 percent to $3.52 at the close, the biggest
one-day increase since the stock began trading publicly in
December 2006. The shares of the Palo Alto, California-based
company have dropped 67 percent in the past 12 months.  On Feb. 25, Affymax fell the most ever after recalling
Omontys, which is used by kidney dialysis patients. Affymax and
its partner Osaka, Japan-based  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502)  at the
time said they were analyzing data from the three patients to
find a cause for the reactions.  Sylvia Wheeler, a spokeswoman for the company, didnâ€™t
return telephone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
