American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer that ended a U.S. bailout in December, said it will
redeem $1.1 billion of debentures as part of an effort to reduce
debt.  The junior subordinated securities pay a 7.7 percent coupon
and are due in 2047, the New York-based firm said today in a
statement.  “The redemption reduces expensive debt, improves our
interest coverage ratios, and puts us in a position to remain
opportunistic with respect to liability management going
forward,” Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche , 68, said in
the statement.  AIG was bailed out in 2008 after  credit downgrades 
increased liabilities on contracts backing investors against
losses on mortgage-related securities. The company, led by
Benmosche since 2009, has the eighth-highest of 10 investment-
grade bond ratings at Moody’s Investors Service.  The insurer gained 1.5 percent to $39.01 today in  New York ,
and has advanced about 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
