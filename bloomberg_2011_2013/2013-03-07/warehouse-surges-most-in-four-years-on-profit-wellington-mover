Warehouse Group Ltd. (WHS) , New Zealand’s
largest discount retailer, rose the most in more than four years
after nearly doubling half-year profit and saying that 12-month
earnings will beat the previous year.  The company reported half-year net income of NZ$106.3
million ($88 million), compared to NZ$54 million a year earlier,
according to a statement today. It expects full-year adjusted
profit after tax to be as much as 17 percent more than a year
earlier. The shares rose 8.3 percent, the biggest daily gain
since October 2008.  Warehouse’s half-year result was boosted by the sale of a
distribution center and three stores, earning a NZ$62.4 million
pretax gain. It also included the acquisition of electronics
retail chain Noel Leeming Group Ltd., which Warehouse said would
merge with its equivalent Bond & Bond network of stores.  “While still early in our multi-year transformation, we
are pleased with the results of investments,” Chief Executive
Officer Mark Powell said in the statement, adding that store re-
fits would accelerate to 24 this calendar year.  Warehouse shares rose 29 cents to NZ$3.79 at the 5 p.m.
close of trading in Wellington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
