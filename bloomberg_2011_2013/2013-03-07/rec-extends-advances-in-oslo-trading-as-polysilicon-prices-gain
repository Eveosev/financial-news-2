Renewable Energy Corp ASA (REC) , the
polysilicon maker grappling with excess capacity, extended gains
in Oslo trading on signs of improving demand and after
researcher PV Insights said that prices jumped last week.  Shares in REC , based in Sandvika near Oslo, rose as much as
9.6 percent to 1.35 kroner, the highest intraday level since
Jan. 10, and traded 8 percent higher as of 9:13 a.m. The stock
yesterday jumped 28 percent, the most in more than four years,
after PV Insights said photovoltaic-grade polysilicon rose 7.1
percent to an average of $18 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) last week.  REC is seeing stronger demand now than at the end of last
year and has reason to believe that some Chinese competitors
have shut down their plants recently, Finansavisen reported
today, citing spokesman Mikkel Toerud.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
