New York  Yankees shortstop Derek
Jeter had his surgically repaired ankle checked by a doctor
today and the team said he is expected back in training camp
tomorrow.  The Major League Baseball club said in a statement that
Jeter’s visit with Robert Anderson in Charlotte, North Carolina,
was “routine and scheduled.” It gave no further information.
Anderson performed the operation in October.  Jeter broke his left ankle in last year’s American League
Championship Series against  Detroit . He has said repeatedly that
he will be ready to play by the time the Yankees open the season
on April 1.  The Yankees have been hit with injuries during spring
training, announcing yesterday that All-Star first baseman Mark
Teixeira would miss as much as 10 weeks because of a strained
wrist.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
