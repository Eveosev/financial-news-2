Nigeria ’s naira appreciated for the
first time in three days after the central bank increased sales
of Treasury bills at an auction.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer gained 0.2
percent to 157.70 per dollar as of 3:50 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold 190 billion naira ($1.2
billion) of Treasury bills at an auction yesterday with a total
subscription of 266 billion naira, the Abuja-based bank said
today in an e-mailed statement. That compares with 135.65
billion naira at the previous auction on Feb. 20.  The strengthening of the naira is largely due to “robust
capital inflows into  government securities ,” Kunle Ezun and
Kenneth Asenime, analysts at Ecobank Transnational Inc. in
Lagos, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose 10 basis points to 10.86 percent, according to
yesterday’s data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell 15 basis points to 4.133 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi gained less than 0.1 percent to 1.9145 per
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
