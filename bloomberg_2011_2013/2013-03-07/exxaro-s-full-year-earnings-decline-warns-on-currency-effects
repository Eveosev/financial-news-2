Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) , a South
African coal mining company, said full-year earnings after
excluding the proceeds from asset sales declined 33 percent.  Earnings per share excluding one-time items fell to 14.01
rand, the company said in  a statement today. Revenue declined
23 percent to 16.1 billion rand ($1.77 billion). The company
will pay a final dividend of 1.5 rand a share, it said.  “The 2013 financial and operational results are expected
to be impacted by commodity price volatility, the rand/US dollar
exchange rate fluctuations as well as the availability of trains
in the export coal business,” the company said.  Exxaro shares  gained 0.6 percent this year compared with a
0.7 percent drop in the  FTSE/JSE Africa Mining Index. (JMNNG)  The stock
declined 1.6 percent yesterday to 170 rand, giving the company a
market capitalization of 60.8 billion rand, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
