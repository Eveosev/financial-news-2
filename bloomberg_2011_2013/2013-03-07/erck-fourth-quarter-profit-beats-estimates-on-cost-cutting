Merck KGaA (MRK)  shares rose to a record
after the German maker of cancer drug Erbitux forecast higher
profit in 2013 and 2014 as accelerated cost cuts helped fourth-
quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization excluding one-time items gained 16 percent to 789.8
million euros ($1 billion), the Darmstadt-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts had predicted 768.9 million
euros, the  average of nine estimates .  Merck, which isn’t related to U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co.,
is cutting jobs and closing facilities following setbacks for
some key medicines and declining sales of Erbitux. The company
has a target to save 300 million euros by 2014 as it expands
outside Europe, particularly in the U.S.,  Japan  and  China .  “We strengthened the quality of our operations across all
divisions,” Chief Executive Officer Karl-Ludwig Kley said
during an analyst call today. “2013 will be the year we will
see most of our transformational changes bearing more fruit.”  The company now expects to save 385 million euros a year by
2018, compared with a previous forecast of 365 million euros due
to a reorganization that has already begun in its pigments
business. Merck said savings from the restructuring contributed
115 million euros in 2012, more than the 55 million euros the
company had forecast. About two-thirds of the restructuring
costs of 504 million euros were in the Merck Serono drug
division.  Shares Gain  Merck rose 2.9 percent to close at 112.20 euros in
 Frankfurt , the highest price since the company’s 1995 initial
stock sale. That gives the company a market value of 24.3
billion euros.  Merck said it expects Ebitda growth to outpace sales in
2013 and 2014 and forecast a “significant” rise in net income
in both years. Sales excluding currency swings should grow at a
moderate pace this year and next and the company doesn’t expect
to start selling any new major products or technologies in its
drug or chemicals businesses before 2015.  Full-year Ebitda of 2.96 billion euros beat the company’s
forecast for 2.9 billion euros to 2.95 billion euros. Total
revenue of 11.2 billion euros exceeded Merck’s goal of about
10.9 billion euros to 11 billion euros for the figure, which
includes sales of 10.7 billion euros and royalties.  Higher Profit  Net income for the quarter more than doubled to 271.8
million euros from 132.9 million euros a year earlier due to
one-time income tax effects and improvements from the
restructuring.  “Merck reported an excellent set of figures above
expectations, despite higher than expected one-offs,” Peter Spengler, an analyst with DZ Bank AG, wrote in a note to
investors.  Total revenue for the quarter rose 8 percent to 2.83
billion euros, beating the 2.78 billion-euro average analyst
estimate.  Revenue at Merck Serono rose 6.1 percent to 1.64 billion
euros. Consumer health sales declined 5 percent to 121 million
euros because of lower demand in  Europe , the division’s biggest
market. The company is reorganizing the unit and will close some
sites.  Sales at the Merck Millipore equipment, ingredient and
services division increased 8.1 percent to 653 million euros.
The performance-materials unit, the world’s biggest maker of
liquid crystals for flat-screen televisions and electronics,
reported a sales increase of 21 percent to 416 million euros,
benefiting from the stronger U.S. dollar.  Merck is closing the Geneva headquarters of its Merck
Serono drug unit and transferring 750 employees elsewhere after
halting work on its multiple sclerosis treatment cladribine. The
company will also eliminate 1,100 positions in  Germany  by the
end of 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
