Serbia’s media advertising market
stagnated in 2012, as broadcast, print and Internet media, along
with outdoor advertising, earned a net 172 million euros ($224
million), according to a  Nielsen  survey.  TV ads gained one percentage point of the market to 56
percent, according to an e-mailed survey by Nielsen Audience
Measurement. Print ads fell to 21 percent from 23 percent of the
market in 2011, while radio and outdoor ads were unchanged at
five and 11 percent, respectively.  Advertisements by political parties in the run-up to May
elections helped compensate part of the decline, said Darko
Brocic, Nielsen’s managing director in Belgrade.  “The market practically shrank if we exclude spending on
political ads,” Brocic said in a phone interview today. The
market peaked in 2008 to 206 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
