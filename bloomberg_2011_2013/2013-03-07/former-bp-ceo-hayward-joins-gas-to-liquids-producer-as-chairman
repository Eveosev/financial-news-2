Tony Hayward , former chief executive
officer of  BP Plc (BP/)  and the current head of Genel Plc, joined gas-
to-liquids company CompactGTL as its non-executive chairman.  The U.K. company’s equipment, allowing producers to create
fuels such as diesel without a refinery, can be used in remote
fields where it’s too expensive to get natural gas to market.  “Tony brings a high profile and industry backing and it’s
a great endorsement for the technology,” CEO Nicholas Gay said
in an interview. “We’re capable of monetizing gas wherever it
is and Tony can help in discussions with major oil companies.”  CompactGTL built the first “modular” GTL plant, operating
since 2010, for Petroleo Brasileiro SA in  Brazil . The closely
held company is backed by private-equity firm Coller Capital
Ltd. Hayward succeeds Jeremy Coller, a Coller Capital partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
