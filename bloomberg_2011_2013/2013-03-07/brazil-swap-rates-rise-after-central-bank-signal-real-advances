Brazil ’s swap rates climbed the most
in almost two weeks after the central bank signaled yesterday
that it is prepared to increase borrowing costs from a record
low to contain inflation.  Swap rates due in January 2014 rose eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 7.75 percent at 9:36 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo . The real gained 0.2 percent to 1.9660 per dollar.  “The central bank is leaving the door open to a rate
increase at the next meeting in case inflation surprises on the
upside,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at WestLB do
Brasil SA in Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview.  Policy makers dropped from their statement a pledge to keep
the target lending rate at a record low for a prolonged period
of time. They held the Selic at 7.25 percent for a third
consecutive meeting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
