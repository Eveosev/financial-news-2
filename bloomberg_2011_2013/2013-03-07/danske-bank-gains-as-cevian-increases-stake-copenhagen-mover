Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , Denmark’s biggest
lender, rose in Copenhagen trading after Cevian Capital AB, the
fund which co-invests with billionaire  Carl Icahn , boosted its
stake to more than 9 percent.  Danske rose as much as 1.2 percent to 107.40 kroner and
traded at that price at 10:34 a.m. in the Danish capital with
volume at 115 percent of the three-month daily average. The
stock lost 4.7 percent yesterday when Realdania sold 52 million
shares in an accelerated bookbuild.  Cevian, which last month said Danske could become one of
the “strongest and most profitable” Nordic banks, bought a
“large part” of Realdania’s offered shares, Lars Foerberg, a
partner at the Stockholm-based fund, said today. Realdania,
which now owns 4.87 percent of Danske, has said it wanted to
reduce its exposure to the bank. It raised 5.5 billion kroner
($955 million) in the sale.  “Cevian is buying more to show they believe in the
investment, convincing others to buy more as well,” Christian Hede, an analyst with Jyske Bank A/S, said by phone. “Cevian
wants to show commitment to their investment.”  Hede, who’s based in Silkeborg,  Denmark , has a strong buy
recommendation on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
