Yields on  Russia ’s 15-year ruble
bonds rose to a record after the government failed to sell the
full offered amount of long-term securities yesterday.  Yields on government ruble bonds due January 2028 rose four
basis points to 7.36 percent, the highest since the notes were
first sold in January and a six basis-point increase in the
week. The ruble lost 0.2 percent against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket to 34.9346 by 7p.m. in Moscow, heading
for a third weekly decline. The currency strengthened 0.2
percent versus the dollar to 30.6550 and weakened 0.5 percent
against euro to 40.1645.  The Finance Ministry sold 15.3 billion rubles ($498
million) of 10-year bonds out of 25 billion rubles offered at an
auction yesterday. The notes were placed at a yield of 6.95
percent, the top end of guidance and a three basis-point premium
to the market.  The decision to offer investors an extra return may
increase pressure on the long end of the government’s yield
curve as higher market premiums become more likely, VTB Capital
analysts Maxim Korovin and Anton Nikitin wrote in a note to
clients today.  There was a high share of “speculative interest” in the
auction, ING Groep NV analyst Dmitry Polevoy wrote in a note
today.  Crude oil futures were little changed in  London , trading at

percent, while  India ’s rupee and  China ’s  yuan  have appreciated
0.8 percent and 0.2 percent respectively.  “We are more likely to see the market going long dollar,
and only the exporters selling can support the ruble in the
current conditions,” Polevoy said.  The new local tax period, when exporters sell foreign
currency revenue to accumulate rubles, starts March 15. Payments
to the budget may total 950 billion rubles in March, according
to HSBC Holdings Plc calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
