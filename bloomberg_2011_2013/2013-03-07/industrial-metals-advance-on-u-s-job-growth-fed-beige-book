Copper climbed after a report showed
faster-than-forecast U.S. job growth and the  Federal Reserve 
said the economy is growing, boosting demand prospects for
industrial metals. Aluminum, nickel and zinc also gained.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.6
percent to $7,737.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and was at $7,714 at 11:32 a.m. in Tokyo. The May contract on
the Comex in New York gained 0.2 percent to $3.4968 per pound.  Figures from ADP Research Institute showed employers added
198,000 jobs last month, topping the median economist forecast
for 170,000 and bolstering optimism before the government’s
labor report on March 8. The  U.S. economy  grew at a modest to
moderate pace amid rising consumer demand for homes and autos,
the Fed said in its Beige Book survey.  “Overnight U.S. economic data lent support to copper,”
said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at Astmax Investment
Management Inc. in Tokyo.  Stockpiles monitored by the LME, up 48 percent this year,
increased 0.2 percent to 473,750 tons, daily exchange figures
showed. Inventories tracked by the Shanghai Futures Exchange are
near a one-year high.  Copper for June delivery on the Shanghai exchange declined
0.7 percent to 56,330  yuan  ($9,054) a ton. On the LME, lead fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
