Most  European stocks  advanced as the
 Federal Reserve  said the U.S. economy is growing and the
 European Central Bank  and  Bank of England  kept their benchmark
interest rates on hold.  Aggreko Plc jumped the most in more than four years after
the world’s largest provider of mobile power supplies reported
increased profit and raised its dividend. Carrefour SA rallied
to a 19-month high after France’s biggest retailer posted a
smaller-than-estimated decline in earnings. Aviva Plc plunged
the most since 2009 after the U.K. insurer cut its dividend.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  declined 0.1 percent to 293.19
at the close of trading, as five shares gained for every four
that fell. The benchmark gauge climbed to its highest level
since June 2008 on March 5 amid optimism that central banks
around the world will continue their stimulus measures. The
index has advanced 4.8 percent this year.  “Investors are hopeful that U.S. economic growth has some
foundation,” Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of research at Charles
Stanley Group Plc in London, said in a telephone interview.
“Irrational exuberance continues to dominate, with continuous
liquidity infusion from central banks.”  The  U.S. economy , the world’s biggest, grew at a modest to
moderate pace across most of the country amid rising consumer
demand for homes and cars, the Fed said late yesterday in its
Beige Book business survey. The assessment helped the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  close at a record of 14,296.24.  U.S. Employment  A Labor Department report today showed the number of
Americans  filing  initial claims for  unemployment benefits 
declined to a six-week low of 340,000 last week. Data tomorrow
may show U.S. employers added 163,000 jobs in February, while
the  unemployment rate  remained at 7.9 percent, according to
Bloomberg surveys of economists.  “New highs in the U.S. make everyone feel better,”  Andy Lynch , a portfolio manager at Schroder Investment Management
Ltd. in London, who helps manage about $1.6 billion, wrote in e-
mailed comments. “Earnings haven’t been disastrous, so there’s
no reason to sell.”  The ECB kept its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged at a
record low of 0.75 percent today, as forecast by 56 of 61
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The central bank predicted the
euro-area economy will shrink 0.5 percent this year, more than
the 0.3 percent contraction it forecast three months ago.  “Later in 2013, economic activity should gradually
recover, supported by a strengthening global backdrop and our
accommodative monetary-policy stance,” ECB President  Mario
Draghi  said at a press conference in  Frankfurt .  National benchmark indexes gained in 13 of the 18 western-
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index added 0.2 percent
and France’s CAC 40 rose 0.5 percent. Germany’s DAX increased
0.3 percent.  Asset Purchases  The Bank of England also left its key rate unchanged, along
with its four-year-old bond-purchase program. The Monetary
Policy Committee maintained its target for quantitative easing
at 375 billion pounds ($564 billion), as forecast by 29 of 39
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The remainder had predicted an
expansion of at least 25 billion pounds.  Aggreko surged 10 percent to 1,939 pence, its biggest gain
since October 2008, as the company forecast “double digit”
average revenue growth over the next five years.  Carrefour (CA)  climbed 2.9 percent to 22 euros, its highest
price since July 2011. Annual recurring operating income fell
2.6 percent to 2.14 billion euros ($2.8 billion), beating the
2.07 billion-euro average analyst estimate.  Adidas AG climbed 6.6 percent to 76.38 euros, the highest
price since the shares started trading in November 1995. The
world’s second-largest sporting-goods maker forecast higher
sales and profit this year and raised its dividend by 35 percent
as it targets fast-growing  emerging markets .  Aviva Sinks  Aviva plummeted 13 percent to 314.8 pence, its biggest drop
since March 2009. The U.K.’s second-largest insurer by market
value said it won’t pay bonuses to its executive directors or
award pay rises for 2013 after cutting its second-half dividend
by 44 percent. The company will pay a final dividend of 9 pence
a share for 2012, down from 16 pence in the previous year.  “ Aviva (AV/)  has historically been one of the biggest dividend
payers and its decision to cut its dividend has had a big
impact,” Batstone-Carr said.  National Express Group Plc (NEX)  slid 11 percent to 204.5 pence,
its biggest drop since Oct. 24. The rail and bus operator’s
largest investor, hedge fund Elliott Advisors, sold a 9.9
percent stake at 210 pence a share.  Davide Campari-Milano SpA slipped 2.7 percent to 5.88
euros. The maker of Skyy vodka reported an unexpected drop in
annual profit amid declining sales in  Italy  and Brazil and said
this year will also be “challenging.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
