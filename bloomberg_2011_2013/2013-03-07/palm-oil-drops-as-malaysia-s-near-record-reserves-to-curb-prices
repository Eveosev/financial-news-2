Palm oil  declined for a third day on
concern that near-record high stockpiles in Malaysia, the
world’s second-largest producer, will further curb prices.  The contract for May delivery lost as much as 0.6 percent
to 2,384 ringgit ($767) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, before ending the morning session at 2,388 ringgit in
Kuala Lumpur. The most-active contract has tumbled 27 percent in
the past year. Some investors deem an asset to be in a  bear
market  if prices drop 20 percent or more.  Palm is poised to slump to less than 2,000 ringgit a ton on
increased global supplies of cooking oils,  Dorab Mistry ,
director at Godrej International Ltd., told a conference
yesterday. While the inventories may drop to about 2.1 million
tons, they’ll rebound close to 3 million tons by the end of this
year, said Mistry. Reserves reached a record 2.63 million tons
in December.  “The sentiment from the conference, which was overall
bearish, is likely to influence the price movement today,” said
Ryan Long, vice president of futures and options at OSK
Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Concerns over the high
stockpiles are still there.”  Inventories, which were at 2.58 million tons in January,
may have decreased to 2.44 million tons last month, according to
a Bloomberg survey published this week. That would still be 18
percent higher than the 2.06 million tons in February last year.
Official data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board are due for
release on March 11.  Soybean oil for May delivery dropped 0.7 percent to 49.91
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for May
delivery fell 0.2 percent to $14.635 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September lost 0.2 percent
to 6,596  yuan  ($1,060) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month lost 1 percent to
8,262 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
