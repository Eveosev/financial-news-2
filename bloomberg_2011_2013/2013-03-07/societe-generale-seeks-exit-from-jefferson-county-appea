  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  asked a federal
court to be dismissed from an appeal by Jefferson County,
Alabama, because it no longer has a financial stake in the
bankrupt county’s sewer bonds.  “Societe Generale has transferred all of its rights, title
and interest in and to those certain Jefferson County Sewer
Revenue Refunding Warrants issued by Jefferson County and
accordingly is no longer interested in pursuing the claims that
are the subject of the appeal,” the bank said in a March 1
filing in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta.  Jefferson County is appealing a bankruptcy judge’s ruling
last year that limited the expenses the county can deduct before
turning sewer revenue over to holders of the bonds, which
included Paris-based  Societe Generale .  Jefferson County began the country’s largest Chapter 9
municipal bankruptcy in November 2011, saying its long-term debt
was $4.23 billion, including about $3.1 billion in defaulted
sewer debt for which the debt holders could look only to the
sewer system for payment. The sewer debt default is at the core
of the county’s financial ills.  The case is In re Jefferson County, 11-05736, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham). The
appellate case is Jefferson County, Alabama v.  Bank of Nova
Scotia (BNS)  New York, 13-10348, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit (Atlanta).  To contact the reporter on this story:
