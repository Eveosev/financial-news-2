Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive Officer
 Antony Jenkins  told some of the lender’s shareholders that the
company may shed almost a third of its workforce over the next
decade as automation and online banking cut the need for staff,
two people familiar with the conversations said.  Jenkins, 51, discussing the long-term future of the bank in
meetings with shareholders, said the London-based lender could
foresee reducing staff levels by 28 percent to about 100,000
over a period of about 10 years, according to the people, who
declined to be identified as the discussions were private.  Barclays today named Shaygan Kheradpir as its chief
operations and technology officer, responsible for helping the
lender automate more systems to cut costs. Britain’s second-
largest lender by assets said in February that it would cut
3,700 jobs to reduce annual costs by 1.7 billion pounds ($2.55
billion).  Sky News  reported Jenkins’s remarks earlier today. A
Barclays spokesman declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
