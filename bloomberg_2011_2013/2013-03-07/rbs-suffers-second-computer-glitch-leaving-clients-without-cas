Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest taxpayer-owned lender, said yesterday’s
computer failure that left customers unable to access their
accounts was unrelated to a similar breakdown last year that
cost it 125 million pounds ($188 million).  The hardware fault, which also affected its NatWest and
Ulster Bank units, has been fixed and all services are “running
as normal again,” the Edinburgh-based bank, which is 81 percent
 owned  by the British government, said in a statement today. RBS
said it was “disappointed that our customers have faced
disruption to banking services for a period yesterday evening.”  RBS was hit by a computer failure at its consumer bank in
June 2012 that left many of its 17 million customers unable to
access their accounts for days. That glitch prompted the
Financial Services Authority to send letters to the U.K.’s nine
largest banks and building societies, reminding them of their
regulatory obligations and urging them to have robust
information-technology systems in place.  “This problem was caused by a hardware fault and was not
related to the issues we experienced last summer,” RBS said in
the statement. “It was much easier to fix, though clearly an
unacceptable failure.”  RBS has said it will pay fees, charges and debt interest
incurred in error as a result of the 2012 incident. Chief
Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  said on June 29 that he would
forgo his bonus for 2012 following the failure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
