The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24 raw materials rose 0.8 percent to settle at 646.65
in  New York , led by natural gas. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of
26 prices rose 0.8 percent to 1,543.633.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures climbed to a 13-week high in New York
after a government report showed that U.S. inventories fell by
more than forecast last week as cold weather boosted demand.  Gas rose 3.2 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said stockpiles fell 146 billion cubic feet in
the week ended March 1 to 2.083 trillion, sending a year-over-
year deficit to the widest gap since July 2008. Analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed a decline of 132 billion
cubic feet. Below-normal temperatures swept across most of the
U.S. last week, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Natural gas for April delivery gained 11.2 cents to $3.582
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement price since Dec. 6.  CRUDE OIL  West Texas Intermediate oil advanced after U.S.
unemployment benefit applications dropped to a six-week low,
bolstering optimism about the country’s economy, and the dollar
weakened against the euro.  Crude oil for April delivery rose $1.13 to settle at $91.56
a barrel on the Nymex.  Brent oil for April settlement rose 9 cents to end the
session at $111.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline’s spread to West Texas Intermediate oil narrowed
as U.S. East Coast supplies of the motor fuel increased and the
gap between WTI and Brent crude shrank. April gasoline’s premium
over later months declined.  The April crack spread, or gasoline’s premium over WTI
crude on Nymex, slipped $1.19 to $39.62 a barrel, the smallest
difference in five days. Brent’s premium over WTI slipped $1.04
to $19.59 a barrel, a one-week low.  April-delivery gasoline fell 0.14 cent to $3.1233 a gallon
on the Nymex on volume that was 13 percent above the 100-day
average. Prices touched $3.1389 earlier.  Heating oil for March delivery rose 0.39 cent to settle at
$2.9795 a gallon on trading volume that was 9.2 percent above
the 100-day average.  Gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.8 cent to
$3.727 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. It was the
eighth consecutive drop.  BASE METALS  Copper gained the most in almost four weeks after the
 European Central Bank  maintained its view that the euro-area
economy will gradually recover later this year and as U.S.
jobless claims unexpectedly dropped.  Copper futures for delivery in May climbed 0.8 percent to
settle at $3.5205 a pound on the Comex in New York, the biggest
gain since Feb. 8.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months added 1 percent to $7,765 a metric ton ($3.52 a pound).  Nickel, aluminum, tin, lead and zinc also rose in London.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures rose as the European Central Bank left
 interest rates  unchanged, driving the euro higher against the
dollar and boosting the appeal of the precious metal as an
alternative investment.  Gold futures for April delivery advanced 20 cents to settle
at $1,575.10 an ounce on the Comex.  Silver futures for May delivery rose less than 0.1 percent
to $28.808 an ounce on the Comex. The price gained for the fifth
straight session, the longest rally since Jan. 23.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for April delivery advanced
1 percent to $1,595.10 an ounce.  Palladium futures for June delivery climbed 2.6 percent to
$759.05 an ounce.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Sugar futures surged the most since November on concern
that shipments will be delayed from  Brazil , the world’s top
exporter. Coffee, cocoa and orange juice rose, while cotton
fell.  Raw sugar for May delivery gained 3.1 percent to settle at
18.77 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest
increase for a most-active contract since Nov. 19. The price

in the U.S., the world’s biggest shipper. Soybean and corn
prices climbed.  Wheat futures for May delivery gained 1.7 percent to settle
at $6.955 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest
increase for a most-active contract since Jan. 15.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$14.735 a bushel, the highest settlement in a month.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to $6.9125 a
bushel. Earlier, the price fell as much as 0.9 percent.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures surged the most since November as slumping U.S.
pork prices fueled speculation that demand for the meat will
increase as consumers shift from more-expensive beef or poultry
cuts. Cattle declined.  Hog futures for April settlement rose 3.2 percent to close
at 81.8 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the
biggest gain since Nov 7. Yesterday, the most-active futures
