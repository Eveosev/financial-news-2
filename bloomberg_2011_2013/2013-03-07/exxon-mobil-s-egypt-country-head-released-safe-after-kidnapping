Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s
largest energy company by market value, said the head of its
Egypt and Cyprus unit was released safely with his wife after
“being held briefly” by kidnappers in Egypt.  Andy Wells and his wife were held by gunmen in Sinai
earlier today demanding the release of defendants in an arms
smuggling case, Mahmoud El-Hifnawy, head of security in South
Sinai, said by phone. Exxon Mobil said the couple were released
without being harmed, according to Alan Jeffers, a company
spokesman, in an e-mailed statement.  Sinai has been the site of several kidnappings of tourists
since the start of the uprising that ousted  Hosni Mubarak  in
2011, highlighting the diminished ability of the country’s
police force to provide security. Two Americans and their
Egyptian tour guide were taken hostage in the peninsula for four
days in July before being released safely.  To contact the reporter on this story:
