Treasuries declined for a fourth
day, the longest losing streak since January, after initial
claims for jobless benefits in the U.S. unexpectedly fell to a
six-week low, spurring appetite for higher-yielding assets.  U.S. 10-year note yields rose the most in a month before
government nonfarm-payrolls data tomorrow that are forecast to
show employers added 165,000 jobs in February. The benchmark
yields increased a month ago when payrolls grew by 157,000
positions. The Treasury said it will sell $66 billion of notes
and bonds next week. Stocks rose.  Investors “are advocating this number will show some
definite strength,” Thomas di Galoma, a managing director at
Navigate Advisors, a brokerage for institutional investors in
Stamford, Connecticut, said of tomorrow’s jobs report. “We’ve
got supply next week.  All of this is putting pressure on the
marketplace.”  The  10-year note yield  increased six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2 percent. It was the biggest intraday jump
since Feb. 5, and the highest level since Feb. 25. The yield’s
last four-day losing stretch ended Jan. 29. The price of the 2
percent security due in February 2023 dropped 17/32, or $5.31
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 1/32 at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.  Yield Range  The benchmark yield has  traded between  1.83 percent and 2
percent since Feb. 26. A day earlier, it dropped as much as 11
basis points, the most since November, as polls showed
inconclusive elections might leave Italy with a hung parliament,
spurring speculation Europe’s debt crisis would worsen.  Thirty-year bond  yields rose five basis points to 3.2
percent, the highest since Feb. 21.  Treasuries dropped after first-time  unemployment claims 
unexpectedly fell by 7,000 to 340,000 in the week ended March 2,
the lowest since the period ended Jan. 19, according to data
today from the Labor Department in Washington. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase
to 355,000. The four-week average dropped to a five-year low.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 0.4
percent to 14,354.69, a record.  “It’s hard for us to stay at really low yields with
equities doing what they are doing,” said Brian Edmonds, head
of interest rates at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. “Maybe
with NFP tomorrow we’ll get to confirm or set the market on a
different trend.”  U.S. nonfarm payrolls have risen by an average of 177,000
jobs a month over the past six months. Ten-year yields increased
three basis points to 2.02 percent on Feb. 1, when the total for
January was close to the 165,000-position forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  ‘Stronger Number’  The yields rose four basis points yesterday after ADP
Research Institute said U.S. companies added 198,000 workers
last month, exceeding the 170,000 estimated by economists.  “The bias is for a stronger number,” said Ian Lyngen, a
government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut. “A significant upward surprise would push 10-year
yields back toward 2 percent.”  Fed purchases of bonds under the quantitative-easing
stimulus strategy have helped keep  10-year yields  below their
five-year average of 2.86 percent as central banks around the
world stimulate their economies to try to revive growth. Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in congressional testimony last week
defended the buying, saying the benefits of reducing borrowing
costs and fueling growth outweigh any potential drawbacks.  Fed Purchase  The central bank purchased $3.68 billion of government debt
today maturing from February 2019 to February 2020. It’s buying
$85 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities a month to
support the economy until policy makers see significant
improvement in the labor market.  Treasuries lost 0.6 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returned 8.5 percent including
reinvested dividends.  Ten-year yields will climb to 2.29 percent by year-end,
according to the weighted-average estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  The U.S. will auction $32 billion of three-year notes on
March 12, $21 billion of 10-year debt the next day and $13
billion of 30-year securities on March 14, the Treasury said.  Trading  volume  rose to $295 billion today after touching
$183 billion on March 4, the lowest level this year, according
to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government
debt. The average daily Treasuries volume for the past 12 months
was $247 billion.  Higher Volatility  Volatility as measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
MOVE index jumped to 60.5 basis points today, the highest level
since Feb. 13. The gauge, which tracks the outlook for swings in
U.S. government debt rates, has averaged 66.4 basis points over
the past year.  The outstanding amount of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes
and bonds rose in February by the most in more than two years as
investors bet inflation will stay low even as the Fed continues
monetary stimulus.  Strips, short for separate trading of registered interest
and principal securities, are created by Wall Street firms that
split bonds into their face amount and individual coupon
payments. The amount of strips, also known as zero-coupon debt,
rose by $6.7 billion, the biggest climb on a monthly basis since
September 2010, according to the data. It rose to $201 billion
at the end of last month, the most since August 2011, Treasury
Department data showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
