Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average capping a six-day advance, after a
report showed U.S. employers added more jobs than expected.
Shares pared gains after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  held off more easing.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an automaker that gets 28 percent of its
sales in  North America , added 4.6 percent. GS Yuasa Corp., which
makes batteries for Boeing Co., surged 8.9 percent on a Reuters
report that U.S. authorities may allow 787 Dreamliner flight
tests with a fix for a battery problem blamed for fires on the
planes.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  climbed 5.5 percent on a Nikkei newspaper
report the optics maker plans to cut debt by 100 billion yen

sixth day, the longest such winning streak since Oct. 23. The
broader Topix Index advanced 0.1 percent to 1,004.35, with 19 of
33 industry groups rising.  “The U.S. labor market is recovering steadily and
gradually,” said Kenji Shiomura, a Tokyo-based senior
strategist at Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Japan’s second-
largest brokerage. “Expectations for further easing in Japan
remain strong, keeping the yen from rising.”  The Topix surged 39 percent from Nov. 14 on optimism the
new government will beat deflation, with Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe nominating easing-proponent Haruhiko Kuroda to lead the
central bank. The measure is trading at 1.2 times  book value ,
compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  fell less than 0.1 percent
today. The U.S. equity gauge gained 0.1 percent yesterday on an
ADP Research Institute report that companies added 198,000

of the country amid rising demand for homes and autos, the
 Federal Reserve  said in its Beige Book report.  Exporters gained after the yen fell to 94.12 against the
dollar today, the weakest since Feb. 25. Mazda added 4.6 percent
to 293 yen. Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., a drugmaker that gets
31 percent of its sales in the U.S., advanced 1.8 percent to
1,381 yen.  Shares pared gains after the BOJ rejected a call for an
immediate start to open-ended asset purchases today in Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa’s final meeting before stepping down on March
19. The central bank also left its asset-purchase fund unchanged
at 76 trillion yen. Kuroda on March 4 vowed to do whatever
necessary to end deflation if named central bank head.  ‘Expected More’  “There may have been some in the market who had expected
something more from the BOJ policy decision today, but overall I
think it was as expected,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist
at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which manages about $163
billion in assets. “The stock market and the  currency market 
maybe got a bit too ahead of themselves in expecting more from
the BOJ.”  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender
by market value, fell 1.5 percent to 527 yen, and  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , the No. 2 bank, slid 2.5 percent to
3,755 yen.  GS Yuasa jumped 8.9 percent to 437 yen. U.S. regulators are
