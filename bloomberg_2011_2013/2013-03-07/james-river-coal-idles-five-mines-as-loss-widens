James River Coal Co. (JRCC) , a producer of
the fuel in the Midwest and Central Appalachia, reported its
biggest loss in at least eight years and said it idled five
underground mines after a decline in demand.  James River idled mines in  Kentucky  and  West Virginia  and
reduced output at three surface mines, cutting production
capacity by 3 million tons, the Richmond, Virginia-based company
said in a statement today. The shares fell 11 percent to $2.26 
at 8:27 a.m. before the start of regular trading in New York.  U.S. coal producers reduced output by 6.9 percent, or 75.2
million tons, in 2012, according to the U.S. Department of
Energy’s Energy Information Administration. Demand for the fuel
slumped amid mild weather and competition from natural gas.  James River ’s fourth-quarter loss widened to $76.9 million,
or $2.21 a share, from $28.5 million, or 82 cents, a year
earlier. The loss excluding a goodwill impairment writedown and
a gain from repurchasing debt was $1.59 a share, wider than the
$1.37 average of 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell
35 percent to $232.2 million from a year earlier.  James River said it isn’t issuing production and cost
guidance. It’s also still looking at “options to strengthen our
balance sheet and improve our liquidity.”  (James River scheduled a conference call at 10 a.m. New
York time, which can be accessed  http://www.jamesrivercoal.com .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
