Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the natural
gas producer that announced the dismissal of co-founder Aubrey McClendon five weeks ago, said former Pride International Inc.
CEO Louis Raspino has joined the board.  Raspino replaces V. Burns Hargis, who resigned, Chesapeake
said in a statement today. Hargis offered to quit in June
following a shareholder vote opposing his re-election but was
allowed to remain on the board to help conduct an inquiry into
McClendon’s private portfolio.  The inquiry concluded last month and found no intentional
misconduct by McClendon in his use of personal stakes in
company-owned wells to obtain more than $800 million in private
loans from some of Chesapeake’s largest financiers.  “Over the past several months, I have admired Burns’
unselfish service on our board,” Archie Dunham, who replaced
McClendon as chairman in June, said in the statement today.  Raspino, a Louisiana State University-trained accountant,
led Pride until its 2011 acquisition by  Ensco Plc. (ESV)  He will lead
the  audit committee  at Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
