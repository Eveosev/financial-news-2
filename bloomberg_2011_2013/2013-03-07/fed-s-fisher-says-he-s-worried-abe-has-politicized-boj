Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President  Richard Fisher  said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
has “politicized” the  Bank of Japan (8301)  in a quest to halt more
than a decade of falling prices.  “He’s aggressive. He has basically politicized the central
bank, which worries me personally,” Fisher said today in a
speech in San Antonio. “But he wants to see this deflationary”
tendency “exorcized” and “he’s working very, very hard to
change things, and indeed the stock market has responded.”  Abe came to office criticizing Bank of Japan Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa for failing to lift Asia’s second-largest
economy out of deflation, and nominated Asian Development Bank
President Haruhiko Kuroda to replace Shirakawa. Kuroda told
parliament this week that the central bank hasn’t bought enough
assets to revive the economy.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average has surged 15 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
