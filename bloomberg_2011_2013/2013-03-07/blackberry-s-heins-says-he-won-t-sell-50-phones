BlackBerry (BBRY) , the Canadian smartphone
maker, said it’s readying less expensive devices for emerging
markets like India, though it has no plans to compete with
lower-cost Asian rivals at the $50 to $60 level.  “Understand where you are playing and resist being talked
into segments that you know will not serve your purpose and will
not result in shareholder value,” Chief Executive Officer
Thorsten Heins said in a question-and-answer session at a
conference in BlackBerry’s hometown of Waterloo, Ontario. “You
will not see us getting into the 50-, 60-buck phone segment.
This is not BlackBerry.”  BlackBerry began selling the Z10 unsubsidized in India last
month at a cost of 43,490 rupees ($800), counting on wealthier
Indians to build buzz for the company’s new operating system
before cheaper BlackBerry 10 models arrive. Sales in  emerging
markets  like Indonesia and India had held up better than in
Europe and North America even as sales overall fell by 47
percent last quarter.  “You will see new products being launched this year based
on BlackBerry 10, all fully LTE-capable, the whole 10 yards,
that are more geared towards those price bands where people need
to be,” Heins said.  Messaging Service  BlackBerry, formerly known as  Research In Motion Ltd. (BB) , has
maintained higher market share in India helped by the popularity
of its free instant-messaging service and lower prices than
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone. The South Asian nation accounts for about
20 percent of BlackBerry’s Asia-Pacific sales, according to IDC.  Asian rivals that sell low-cost phones in India include
China’s ZTE Corp. and Huawei Technologies.  Heins said he was surprised by how well the touch-screen
Z10 sold in India after its Feb. 26 debut, with five days’ worth
of inventory vanishing in two days.  “I got an emergency call from my manager from India
saying, ‘I’m sold out after two days,’” Heins said. “So now
we’re scrambling to reload those channels.”  BlackBerry shares fell 1 percent to $13.22 at the close
today in New York. The stock has gained 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
