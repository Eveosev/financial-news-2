Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are
two shots off the lead during the opening round of the U.S. PGA
Tour’s Cadillac Championship in Miami.  Woods, the No. 2 player in the Official World Golf Ranking,
had four birdies and two bogeys through his first nine holes at
the TPC Blue Monster course at Doral Resort and Spa. Mickelson
had two birdies through his first six.  Woods and Mickelson, who have combined for 18 major
tournament titles, are tied for 10th place, two shots behind co-
leaders Hunter Mahan and  Webb Simpson  of the U.S. and Thaworn
Wiratchant of  Thailand .  Rory McIlroy, the world’s No. 1 player from Northern
Ireland, is at even-par through 10 holes a week after quitting
the Honda Classic eight holes into his second round. McIlroy was
7-over par at the time and cited wisdom-tooth pain for his
withdrawal. He later apologized, saying he made a mistake and
should have completed his round.  This week’s World Golf Championship tournament features a
limited field of the top 65 players, based on the Official World
Golf  Ranking  and other performance criteria. The purse is $8.8
million, including $1.4 million for the winner, with no cut for
weekend play and a paycheck for everyone who completes the four
rounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
