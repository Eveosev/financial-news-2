President  Richard Fisher  said the central bank should start
scaling back asset purchases because the housing market “is
getting to be quite strong.”  “A little tapering there would help people realize that
we’ve bottomed out,” Fisher said today in a television
interview with Fox Business Network. “In most states now the
housing market is definitely rising, prices are rising, the
inventory’s getting tighter.”  Housing has gained as Fed easing helped push  mortgage rates 
to record lows.  Home prices  rose 6.8 percent in December from a
year earlier, according to the Case-Shiller 20 City index, the
fastest increase since 2006. The gauge rose every month last
year. New home sales accelerated in January to a 437,000 annual
pace, the highest since 2008.  The Fed started a third round of quantitative easing in
September with $40 billion of monthly agency mortgage-backed
securities purchases. The program was expanded in December with
$45 billion of monthly purchases of Treasury notes.  “I’m not talking about cutting off the purchase, just
tapering it down,” said Fisher, who doesn’t vote on the  Federal
Open Market Committee  this year.  Fisher has been one of the most outspoken critics within
the Fed of additional monetary easing by the central bank. He
said in January that the potential costs of asset purchases to
spur economic growth have begun to outweigh the benefits as the
Fed’s balance sheet exceeds  $3 trillion .  To contact the reporter on this story:
