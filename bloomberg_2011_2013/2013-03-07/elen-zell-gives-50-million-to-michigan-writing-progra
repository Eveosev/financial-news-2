Helen Zell, the wife of billionaire
investor  Sam Zell , gave $50 million to the  University of
Michigan  for a creative writing program through her family
foundation.  The gift, the largest in the history of the school’s
College of Literature, Science and the Arts, will permanently
fund scholarships and stipends for 22 master’s students in
creative writing, the university in  Ann Arbor  said today on its
 website . The program, founded in 1982, will be named the Helen
Zell Writers’ Program.  Zell, who graduated from Michigan in 1964, is executive
director of the Zell Family Foundation, which made the gift. Sam
Zell is the chairman and chief executive officer of Chicago-
based Equity Group Investments LLC. In 2007, Zell sold Equity
Office Properties Trust to  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  for $39 billion.
The same year, he orchestrated an $8.3 billion leveraged buyout
of Tribune Co., owner of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles
Times, which then went into bankruptcy from 2008 until 2012.  “Helen Zell is a patron of writing at the University of
Michigan” Mary Sue Coleman, the university’s president, said in
the statement. “This is a transformative gift in the
humanities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
