1250 Oceanside Partners and two
affiliates, owners of more than 1,800 acres of land on the
Island of  Hawaii , filed for bankruptcy to restructure more than
$500 million in debt.  Oceanside listed assets of more than $10 million in Chapter
11 documents filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Honolulu. Affiliates Front Nine LLC and Pacific Star Co. also
sought court protection.  The restructuring will “allow the debtors’ development
projects to proceed, and will permit their respective creditors
to receive payment in excess of the liquidation value of their
claims,” Craig Pickett, the companies’ sole executive officer,
said in court papers.  Assets acquired for the development of Hokuli’a, a luxury
real estate project, include a 3 1/2-mile tract along the Kona
coast, Pickett said. Oceanside’s creditors include the County of
Hawaii, with a claim of $20 million, and Ackerman Ranch Inc.,
with a claim of $13.4 million, according to court papers.  Developer Lyle Anderson controlled the three companies
until 2008, when Bank of Scotland LLC declared a default on
about $1 billion in debt and exercised its right to replace the
directors, including Anderson.  The debt was secured by projects in  New Mexico ,  Arizona  and
Hawaii. Sun Kona Finance I LLC acquired the portion secured by
Hawaiian assets in December. The total balance due on that debt
was about $625.2 million, according to court papers.  The case is In re 1250 Oceanside Partners, 13-00353, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii (Honolulu).  To contact the reporter on this story:
