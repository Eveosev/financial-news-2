PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest carmaker, will offer savings accounts through 
its financing arm to raise funding for dealerships and other
automotive operations.  Banque PSA Finance is targeting deposits of 400 million
euros ($521 million) by the end of the year, Chief Financial
Officer Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said at a press conference in
Paris today.  The automaker is striving to raise funds to maintain the
unit’s investment grade at Moody’s Investors Service, with
measures that include refinancing the division’s debt. Standard
& Poor’s Ratings Services cut Peugeot’s debt in February by one
level and downgraded debt at the banking unit to junk.  France ’s government offered guarantees last year for as
much as 7 billion euros in new bond sales by the banking unit.
Peugeot has won temporary European Union backing to sell 1.2
billion euros in government-backed bonds and must present more
details on the plan to win full approval.  Peugeot is following competitor  Renault SA (RNO)  in setting up a
retail banking arm. RCI Banque began offering savings accounts
in February of last year, with a deposit target of 500 million
euros. It exceeded that goal and had total deposits of 893
million euros at end of December, RCI Banque said last month.  RCI Banque is now aiming for total deposits of 2 billion
euros at its French and German retail savings businesses by the
end of this year, and to increase that figure to 2.5 billion
euros by the end of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
