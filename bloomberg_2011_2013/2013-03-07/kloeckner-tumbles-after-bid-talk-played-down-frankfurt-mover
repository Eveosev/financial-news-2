Kloeckner & Co. (KCO) , the German steel
trader part-owned by the Knauf family, slumped the most in 14
months in Frankfurt trading after Bank of America Merrill Lynch
played down the company’s prospects for being taken over.  Kloeckner  slid  4.7 percent, the biggest decline since May,
to 10.96 euros as of the close. About 1.71 million shares were
traded, double the three-month average daily volume. Before
today, the stock had rallied 22 percent since Feb. 18.  “We don’t expect a merger/bid for KCO and think bid
speculation will subside,” Bank of America wrote in a note to
clients today.  Interfer Holding GmbH, which owns competitor Knauf Interfer
SE, said last month it bought a 7.82 percent stake in Kloeckner.
Interfer, owned by Dortmund-based entrepreneur Albrecht Knauf,
is now the company’s largest shareholder, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Interfer said in a meeting March 1 that it “supports the
Kloeckner & Co. management board’s strategy of expanding
activities in the USA in parallel with systematic restructuring
in European markets,” Kloeckner said yesterday. “Any other
link-up with Kloeckner & Co was not a topic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
