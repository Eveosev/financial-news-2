Steaua Bucharest beat Chelsea 1-0 in
their opening round-of-16 match in soccer’s Europa League.  Steaua’s Raul Rusescu scored with a 34th-minute penalty
kick in Romania after being fouled by Ryan Bertrand. Chelsea is
playing in Europe’s second-tier club competition after being
eliminated from the elite  Champions League , which it won last
season.  Newcastle drew 0-0 with Anzhi Makhachkala in Moscow, Lazio
won 2-0 at Stuttgart and Fenerbahce was a 1-0 winner at Viktoria
Plzen. Tottenham hosts  Inter Milan  among tonight’s four late
games.  The return matches in the two-game series will be played
March 14, with the winners advancing to the quarterfinals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
