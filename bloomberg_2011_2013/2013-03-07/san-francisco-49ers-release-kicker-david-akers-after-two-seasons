David Akers  was released by  San
Francisco  a month after he kicked three field goals for the
49ers in their 34-31  Super Bowl  loss to the  Baltimore Ravens .  Akers, 38, a 14-year veteran and six-time Pro Bowl
selection, kicked a National Football League-record 44 field
goals in 2011, his first year in San Francisco. Last year, he
tied the record for the longest field goal with a 63-yarder.  Akers went in to the Super Bowl having succeeded with 29 of
42 field goal attempts, the worst record of any kicker heading
to the title game in 29 years. His 69 percent success rate was
the lowest of his career and below the NFL average of 84 percent.  “The 49ers would like to thank David for his service,
dedication and leadership over the past two years,” said 49ers
General Manager Trent Baalke. “He is a true professional who
represented himself and this organization with class.”  Akers set a franchise record by kicking at least one field
goal in all 32 regular-season games he played for the 49ers and
was successful on 73 of 94 attempts and all 78 points after
touchdown for the team. His 297 points over the past two seasons
ranks first in the NFL over that time span.  Akers is 367-of-453 on career field goal attempts and 521
of 527 points after touchdowns for 1,622 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
