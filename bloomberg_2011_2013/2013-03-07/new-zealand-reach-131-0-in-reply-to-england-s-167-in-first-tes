New Zealand trailed England by 36
runs with 10 wickets in hand after two days of the rain-affected
opening cricket Test against New Zealand in Dunedin.  The home side was 131 without loss at stumps after England
was dismissed for 167. Debutant Hamish Rutherford scored 77 and
Peter Fulton made 46. Earlier Neil Wagner and Bruce Martin each
took four wickets as England were dismissed in 55 overs.  No play was possible on the opening day of the best-of-
three series yesterday because of rain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
