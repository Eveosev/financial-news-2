Chinese stocks  slumped, led by
financial and health-care companies, on concern regulators will
restart approving initial public offerings and data this week
will show trade weakened as inflation quickened.  Ping An Bank Co. dropped among smaller lenders as its 30-
day volatility surged to the highest in four years. The  China 
Securities Regulatory Commission may allow IPOs from June, the
Shanghai Securities News reported, citing an unidentified
person. Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co. slid the most in almost three
months after technical indicators signaled declines.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  declined 1 percent to 2,324.29
at the close, taking its loss for the week to 1.5 percent. The
 CSI 300 (SHSZ300)  dropped 1.2 percent to 2,619.48. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  fell 0.6 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
Index (CH55BN)  retreated 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday.  “Volatility has been rising, and will be unlikely to
settle till we see reassurance on earnings, IPOs,” monetary
policy and the National People’s Congress meetings, said Hao Hong, head of China research at Bank of Communications Co. in
Hong Kong. “ Risk aversion  is on the rise.”  The Shanghai gauge plunged 3.7 percent on March 4 as the
government ordered curbs to cool property prices, before
rebounding 3.3 percent in the past two days. The gauge, up 19
percent since reaching an almost four-year low on Dec. 3, trades
for 9.6 times  projected  12-month earnings. That compares with
the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.3 times, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Share Sales  The CSRC suspended issuance of IPO shares in late October
as investors’  appetite  for new stocks waned amid falling share
prices. A media official at the CSRC, who asked not to be
identified because of the regulator’s rules, declined to comment
on the Shanghai Securities News report. People’s Insurance Co.
plans to list its shares in the second half of the year, Ming
Pao Daily News reported today, citing company Chairman Wu Yan.  A gauge tracking financial stocks slid 1.9 percent as its
30-day  volatility  traded at the highest level since May 2010.
Ping An Bank slumped 2.1 percent to 23.74  yuan  before the
company reports earnings. The stock jumped 11 percent in the
past two days following a 5.7 percent plunge on March 4. Bank of
Beijing Co. retreated 3.6 percent to 9.18 yuan and Bank of
Nanjing Co. declined 3.5 percent to 9.62 yuan.  Exports probably grew 8.1 percent last month, slowing from
the previous month’s 25 percent gain, while imports dropped 8.5
percent, data tomorrow will show according to a Bloomberg
economist survey. Inflation quickened to 3 percent in February,
compared with 2 percent in the previous month, according to
another report on March 9, while industrial output probably grew
10.6 percent last month.  ‘Market Concerns’  “We think that the inflation and activity numbers, to be
released on Saturday, may add to recent market concerns about
the risk of further policy tightening,”  Jian Chang , a Hong
Kong-based economist at Barclays, wrote in a report yesterday.
Trade data “could weigh on  market sentiment ,” she wrote.  The NPC, in session in Beijing, brings together the most
powerful people in China under one roof every March. Earlier
this week, outgoing Premier  Wen Jiabao  told delegates at the
national legislature the government would keep its economic
growth target at 7.5 percent, unchanged from 2012, while
projecting a 10 percent jump in fiscal spending. Xi Jinping will
become president and Li Keqiang premier at the end of the NPC.  Health-care stocks fell the most among 10 industrial groups
on the CSI 300, declining 3.1 percent. Kangmei Pharmaceutical
lost 6.6 percent to 16.24 yuan, paring this year’s gain to 24
percent. Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical Co. retreated 1.9
percent to 25.86 yuan.  Relative Strength  The drugmakers’ gauge has rallied 19 percent this year and
surged to the highest level since July 2011 yesterday, when its
14-day relative strength index reached 67.20. Some analysts see
a reading of more than 70 for the  RSI (SZ399913) , which measures how
rapidly prices have advanced or declined during the specified
time period, as a signal to sell.  Separately, Chinese banks and insurers’  Hong Kong  units
will be permitted to participate in a program that allows
institutions to raise yuan offshore for investment in China,
mainland regulators said. Participants will also be able to
invest in stock-index futures, where before they were limited to
equities and bonds, the China Securities Regulatory Commission
said on its website yesterday.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., advanced 0.7 percent to
$38.50.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  dropped 11 percent to $43.44 in New York,
the biggest slump since February 2012, after denying a report
that it’s looking to go private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
