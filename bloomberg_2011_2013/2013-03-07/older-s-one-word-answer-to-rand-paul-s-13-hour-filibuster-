Rand Paul  held the U.S. Senate floor  for almost 13 hours yesterday in a symbolic filibuster against Obama's pick to head the Central Intelligence Agency,  John Brennan . Paul questioned whether the administration might use armed drones to attack Americans on U.S. soil. Below is the full text of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder's written response to  Paul's lengthy questioning :  Dear Senator Paul:  It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: "Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?" The answer to that question is no.  Sincerely,  Eric H. Holder, Jr.
