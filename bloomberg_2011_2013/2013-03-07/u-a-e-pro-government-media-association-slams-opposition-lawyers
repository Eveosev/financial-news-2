The United Arab Emirates’
Journalists Association denounced the defense lawyers for a
group accused of conspiring against the government, saying they
are putting pressure on local media, the state news agency WAM
said.  The lawyers and families of the defendants are trying to
“intimidate” local reporters so that they “deviate from the
patriotic line,” the association, which traditionally supports
the government against criticism from international human rights
organizations, said in a statement, according to WAM.  International media were denied access to the hearing when
the U.A.E. Federal Supreme Court on March 4 opened the case
against 94 citizens, including 13 women, charged with forming a
secret organization to overthrow the government.  The media association said that defense lawyers have asked
the government to “restrain the press” from hostile reports
about the defendants, and threatened to sue local media
including the al Khaleej newspaper over coverage of the case.  Amnesty International  said the U.A.E. authorities denied
its delegate entry into the country ahead of the trial held in
the capital  Abu Dhabi , “highlighting serious questions about
its transparency and fairness,” the organization said in a
March 3 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
