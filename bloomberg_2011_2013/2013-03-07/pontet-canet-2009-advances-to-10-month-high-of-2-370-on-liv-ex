Ten cases of Chateau Pontet-Canet
2009 sold for 1,575 pounds ($2,370) each on London’s Liv-ex
wine market yesterday as the Bordeaux fifth-growth wine estate
extended gains made since the start of this year to 13 percent,
according to data on the exchange’s Cellar Watch website.  Pontet-Canet, a Pauillac winery which is a close neighbor
to first-growths Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and Chateau
Mouton-Rothschild, fetched as much as $3,690 a case at an  Acker
Merrall & Condit   New York  sale in December, according to the
auction house’s online records. Pontet-Canet’s 2009 is its
highest-priced vintage since its 1959, according to Liv-ex data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
