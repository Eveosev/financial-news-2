U.S. mortgage rates were little
changed, keeping borrowing costs close to record lows after  home
prices  rose the most in almost seven years.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan was 3.52 percent
in the week ended today, up from 3.51 percent, McLean, Virginia-
based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-year rate
held at 2.76 percent.  The U.S. housing market is rebounding as  interest rates 
hover near historic lows, helping to fuel demand for a shrinking
 supply  of property listings. Home prices jumped 9.7 percent in
the 12 months through January, the biggest gain since April
2006, according to CoreLogic Inc., an  Irvine , California-based
real estate data firm.  “House prices rose strongly at the start of 2013 and are
likely to perform well across the year as a whole,”  Paul Diggle , property economist for Capital Economics Ltd. in London,
said in a note to clients March 5 after CoreLogic’s data were
released. “This is set to be another tear-away year for the
housing recovery.”  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index of home-loan
applications rose 14.8 percent in the period ended March 1, the
most in seven weeks. The  refinance  gauge also jumped 14.8
percent, while the  purchase  measure climbed 15 percent, the
Washington-based group reported yesterday.  A  survey  released today by  Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac’s larger
rival, showed that 48 percent of Americans believe home prices
will rise in the next 12 months, the highest level since the
monthly poll began in June 2010. The share of Americans who
think mortgage rates will climb increased to 45 percent in
February from 41 percent the previous month.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent in November, according to  Freddie Mac . The 15-year rate
fell to 2.63 percent, also the lowest on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
