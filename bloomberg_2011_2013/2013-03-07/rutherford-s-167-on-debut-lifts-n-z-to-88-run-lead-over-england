Hamish Rutherford struck 171 in his
Test cricket debut to help New Zealand build a 235-run lead
against  England  with two days of their rain-affected series
opener remaining.  Left-hander Rutherford, whose father Ken had a decade-long
career with the national team, achieved the seventh-highest Test
score on debut at his hometown ground in Dunedin to help lift
the Black Caps to 402-7 before rain and bad light forced play to
be abandoned for the day.  “It was very special to do it here in front of my home
fans and family and friends,” Rutherford, 23, said in a
televised interview. “To get out with the first ball of the new
ball was very disappointing. I wanted to bat for another half
hour and go from there. I don’t like getting out.”  Rutherford, whose 217-ball innings included 22 fours and
three sixes, chipped a catch to midwicket to be one of four
dismissals for  James Anderson , who is England’s best bowler with
figures of 4-108.  Stuart Broad  has 2-89, his first wickets in
elite matches since August.  Rutherford’s innings contrasted with his father’s Test
debut in 1985, when he got out without scoring in both innings
against the West Indies in Trinidad. Ken Rutherford went on to
play  56 Tests  and also captained the team.  New Zealand, which had resumed today at 131 without loss,
reached 255-2 at lunch and then added 130 runs for the loss of
five wickets in the middle session by lifting the scoring rate
to five runs per over.  Home captain Brendon McCullum, who put England in to bat
after winning the toss, was unbeaten on 44 with Bruce Martin on
17 when the the umpires took the players off the field five
overs after the tea break. Bad light and rain wiped out the
opening day of the best-of-three match contest.  New Zealand , which has lost eight of its past 11 Tests,
yesterday dismissed England for 167, its lowest score when
batting first in matches between the teams. The Blacks Caps last
won a Test series against England 14 years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
