The U.S.  Justice Department  asked
the Treasury Department about the economic impact of potential
criminal charges against the  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HBC)  when the bank
was probed for money laundering, an official said today.  London-based HSBC agreed to pay $1.92 billion in December
to close a global money-laundering case with the Justice
Department and U.S. and U.K. banking regulators. The settlement
included a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S.  “The Justice Department contacted us, asked whether we
could provide guidance on what the impact to the financial
system may be of a criminal disposition in the HSBC case,”
 David Cohen , the Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and
financial intelligence, said during a Senate Banking Committee
hearing. “We were not in a position to offer any meaningful
guidance.”  He was responding to a question from  Elizabeth Warren , a
Democrat from Massachusetts who asked Cohen and others
testifying why the government doesn’t shut down banks that break
the law.  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said yesterday that the
size of the largest financial institutions has made it difficult
to bring criminal charges when there’s wrongdoing. Criminal
charges against a bank -- something that could threaten its
existence -- may also endanger the national or global economies
because of their size and interconnectedness, Holder said at a
Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
