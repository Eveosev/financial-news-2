U.K. stocks advanced, with the
benchmark index heading for the highest level since January
2008, as shares of commodity producers and banks rallied.  The FTSE 100 Index rose 17.15 points, or 0.3 percent, to
6,444.79 at 1:15 p.m. in  London . The benchmark gauge has rallied
9.3 percent so far this year and jumped to a five-year high this
week on optimism central banks around the world will continue
with stimulus measures. The broader FTSE All-Share Index gained
0.2 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.4 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
FTSE 100 was 46 percent greater than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of England today
maintained their monetary-policy stance, signaling no expansion
in economic stimulus.  ECB policy makers meeting in Frankfurt today kept the
benchmark rate at a record low of 0.75 percent, as forecast by
56 of 61 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. President Mario
Draghi holds a press conference at 2:30 p.m. in  Frankfurt  to
explain the decision.  In London, BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor
Mervyn King maintained its target for quantitative easing at 375
billion pounds ($562 billion). The decision was forecast by 29
of 39 economists in a Bloomberg News survey, with the remainder
having predicted an expansion of at least 25 billion pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
