Natural gas futures climbed to a 13-
week high in New York after a government report showed that U.S.
inventories fell by more than forecast last week as cold weather
boosted demand.  Gas rose 3.2 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said stockpiles fell 146 billion cubic feet in
the week ended March 1 to 2.083 trillion, sending a year-over-
year  deficit  to the widest gap since July 2008. Analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed a decline of 132 billion
cubic feet. Below-normal temperatures swept across most of the
U.S. last week, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC.  “You are still driven mostly by Mother Nature and that can
be a huge deviation,” said Kyle Cooper, director of research
with IAF Advisors in Houston. “You have a bullish year-on-year
comparison and there is a lot of upward momentum in the
market.”  Natural gas for April delivery gained 11.2 cents to $3.582
per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest settlement price since Dec. 6. Trading
volume was 53 percent above the 100-day average at 2:42 p.m. The
futures have risen 6.9 percent this year.  April $3.25 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They declined 1.3 cents to 1 cent per
million Btu on volume of 721 contracts at 2:43 p.m. Puts
accounted for 51 percent of options volume.  Spread Narrows  The discount for April contracts to October, a gauge of
summer demand for gas, narrowed 2.1 cents to 19.7 cents, the
least since Dec. 18. The discount over the past month has been
at its narrowest compared with any April-October spread for the
same period going back to 2004.  The stockpile decrease was bigger than the five-year
average decline for the week of 107 billion cubic feet, EIA data
show. Supplies fell by 92 billion during the same period last
year. The previous winter was the fourth-warmest on record for
the lower 48 states, which  reduced demand  amid  record
production .  A  surplus  to the five-year average narrowed to 14.8 percent
from 16 percent the previous week. Gas supplies were also 14.8
percent below  year-earlier  inventories, compared with 12.1
percent in last week’s report.  The bigger-than-expected withdrawal from storage is
indicative of the cold snap last week and a seasonal shutdown of
nuclear generation, said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork
Group Inc., a consulting group in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .
“It’s maintenance season and we have less electrons being fired
up by the nukes so that is steering demand toward natural gas.”  Nuclear Plants  Output from U.S. nuclear plants today totaled 86,034
megawatts, or 84 percent of capacity, according to U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Production has
fallen 10 percent from this year’s high reached on Feb. 1.  A wet, windy storm may drop 4 to 6 inches (15 to 12
centimeters) of snow in  Boston  and 1 to 3 inches may accumulate
in New York City after dark, according to the National Weather
Service in Taunton,  Massachusetts .  The outlook for the eastern third of the U.S. turned colder
for March 12 through March 16 with below-normal temperatures
spreading from the Midwest and into the mid-Atlantic states,
according to MDA Weather Services. The Gaithersburg, Maryland-
based company said a “much warmer pattern” is developing for
the Midwest, East and South in the 11- to 15-day forecast.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
data show from the EIA, a unit of the Energy Department.  Cold March  A 30-day outlook published by MDA last week suggested that
U.S. cumulative heating degree days, a measure of weather-driven
gas demand, will rise to 655 in March, the most for the month
since 1999, Teri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy at
BNP Paribas SA in New York, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Viswanath expects gas inventories to drop to 1.92 trillion
cubic feet at the end of March, when the heating season winds
down, 5 percent lower than her previous estimate of 2.021
trillion. A widening year-over-year supply deficit will support
cash-market prices, which may “prevent a seasonal selloff in
futures,” she said.  U.S. gas production in December fell for the first time in
four months, capping the slowest annual growth rate in three
years, according to the monthly EIA-914 report on Feb. 28.
Output slipped 0.7 percent to 82.57 billion cubic feet a day as
operators in  Louisiana ,  Texas  and the Gulf of Mexico shut wells.
Production rose 0.6 percent from December 2011.  The boom in oil and natural gas output helped the U.S. meet
84 percent of its energy needs in the first 11 months of last
year, government data show. If the trend continued through 2012,
it will be the highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporters on this story:
