Sugar climbed for a fourth day in
 New York , the longest winning streak since October, on
speculation port congestion will delay exports from  Brazil , the
world’s largest grower. Coffee also advanced.  As many as 202 vessels were waiting to load corn and
soybeans at Brazil’s main ports as of yesterday, up from 188
ships a week earlier, data from SA Commodities and Unimar
Agenciamentos Maritimos show. More grains and oilseed being
loaded may delay sugar shipments.  “The grain and oilseed shipping needs are impacting
Brazilian logistics and the ability and costs to move sugar,”
said Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank International in
London.  Raw sugar for May delivery gained 0.3 percent to 18.26
cents a pound by 11:27 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.

metric ton on NYSE Liffe in in  London .  Raw sugar for May delivery become more expensive than the

more expensive today, after being at a discount of 0.06 cent on
March 5.  Cocoa for May delivery climbed 0.1 pecent to $2,043 a ton
