Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s development of a
version of the best-selling drug Rituxan is proceeding as
planned, Jeff George, who heads the company’s Sandoz generics
unit, said in an interview today.  “Our program is on track,” George said in Tokyo today.
“But we’ve never given a time line as to when we are coming to
market with the product.”  Companies including Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH are racing to
bring a biosimilar version of the drug, also known as rituximab,
to the market. The original compound, sold by  Roche Holding AG (ROG) 
and  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) , had about $7 billion in sales last year.
Roche’s Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan said in January
that the introduction of Sandoz’s product may be delayed until
2016, Bloomberg Industries analysts wrote in a note.  “What I can say is that a number of competitors have faced
issues with their clinical trial programs,” George said.  Sandoz is running trials in the two most important
indications of the drug, rheumatoid arthritis and non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. Rituxan is also sold as MabThera.  To contact the reporters on this story:
