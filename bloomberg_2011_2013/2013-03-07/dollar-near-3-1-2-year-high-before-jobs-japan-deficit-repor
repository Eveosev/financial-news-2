The dollar rose to the strongest
since August 2009 against the yen before a U.S. report that
analysts said will show employers stepped up hiring last month,
adding to signs the world’s biggest economy is gaining momentum.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  approached the highest since August on
speculation an improving labor market will convince the Federal
Reserve to end its program of asset purchases known as
quantitative easing. The yen dropped at least 0.6 percent
against all its 16 major counterparts as a government report
showed  Japan ’s current-account deficit widened in January.
Sweden’s krona fell from a six-month high against the euro after
industrial production declined.  “There’s been a market realization that the real economy
in the U.S. is in a growth phase,” said Peter Frank, global
head of currency strategy at  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
in London. “That’s a really strong reason to be bullish on the
dollar. By the end of this year, the Fed will start to give
details of how it’s going to withdraw its accommodative policy.
There’s nothing positive for the yen right now.”  The dollar advanced 1 percent to 95.74 yen at 7:15 a.m. in
New York after climbing to 95.80, the highest level since Aug.
13, 2009. The U.S. currency was little changed at $1.3108 per
euro after sliding 1.1 percent yesterday, the biggest decline
since Jan. 10. The yen fell 1 percent to 125.52 per euro.  U.S. employers added 165,000 jobs last month, up from
157,000 in January, according to a Bloomberg News survey before
the Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington . The
 jobless rate  held at 7.9 percent, a separate survey showed.  ‘Taper Off’  “The greater the momentum in the U.S. economy, the sooner
the Fed will taper off QE,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency
strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Sydney. “Dollar-yen is a
preferred tool for dollar bulls at the moment.”  After strengthening through 95 yen this week, the dollar
may climb to 100 yen by year-end, Banco Bilbao’s Frank said.
Implied volatility from options trading shows the probability of
the greenback reaching that level by Dec. 31 is 66 percent.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six U.S. trading
partners, gained 0.1 percent to 82.19 after rising to 82.604 on
March 6, the highest level since Aug. 20.  Yen Falls  The yen extended a second weekly loss against the dollar as
the Ministry of Finance said the deficit in the current account,
the widest measure of trade, increased to 364.8 billion yen in
January, up from 264.1 billion yen a month ago.  Japan’s currency has slumped 9.4 percent versus the dollar
this year as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pushed the central bank
to add to stimulus to beat deflation. Haruhiko Kuroda, Abe’s
pick to become the next  Bank of Japan (8301)  governor, told lawmakers
this week the scale of the BOJ’s asset purchases was
insufficient to achieve its target of 2 percent inflation.  The yen has tumbled 8 percent in 2013, the biggest drop
among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 2.7 percent and
the euro climbed 1.9 percent.  The euro headed for a weekly advance versus the dollar,
snapping four weeks of declines, after European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi said yesterday the region will gradually
recover later this year.  “With the euro risk receding and expectations for U.S.
economic growth improving, the yen may come under selling
pressure in a risk-on trade” said Junichi Ishikawa, an analyst
at IG Markets Securities Ltd. in  Tokyo .  Krona Weakens  The krona dropped against all except one of its major peers
after Statistics Sweden said industrial production declined an
annual 7.8 percent in January after falling 2.2 percent the
previous month. Production was estimated to decline 4.8 percent,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Sweden’s currency weakened 0.4 percent to 8.3288 per euro
after earlier advancing to 8.2832, the strongest since Aug. 28.
The krona dropped 0.4 percent to 6.3552 per dollar.  South Africa’s rand rose for the first time in three days
after Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus said the currency’s
decline to beyond 9 per dollar was excessive.  The rand “will, over a period of time, retrace back to a
more reasonable level,” Marcus said in an interview with Manus Cranny on Bloomberg Television.  The currency gained 0.4 percent to 9.1044 per dollar after
falling to 9.1884 yesterday, the weakest since April 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
