Landsbankinn hf, Iceland’s biggest
bank by assets, said profit rose on foreign-exchange gains and
reduced losses on loans and advances.  Net income at the Reykjavik-based lender rose 50 percent to
25.5 billion kronur ($203 million) from 17 billion kronur a year
earlier, the company said in a statement on its  website  today.  “The bank’s performance in 2012 was good and the bank’s
strong equity and liquidity positions provide possibilities for
growth,” Steinthor Palsson, chief executive officer, said in
the statement.  Landsbankinn was created in 2008 from the domestic
operations of  Landsbanki Islands hf  after that bank was unable
to secure short-term funding and failed in October the same
year. Landsbanki’s collapse left 350,000 depositors in the
lender’s Icesave Internet accounts in the U.K. and  Netherlands 
in fear of losing their life savings. The liquidated assets from
Landsbanki’s estate are now expected to cover all deposits in
full.  After Landsbankinn’s creation, Iceland’s government handed
over an 18.7 percent stake in the lender to Landsbanki’s
creditors and issued a bond worth 260 billion kronur as
compensation for its domestic assets. Iceland’s Treasury retains
a 81.3 percent stake.  Net interest income rose 9 percent to 35.6 billion kronur,
operating income climbed 60 percent to 49.1 billion kronur and
assets fell 4.5 percent to 1.08 trillion kronur. The bank’s
capital adequacy ratio rose to 25.1% at yearend from 14.9% at
the start of 2010.  Gains on foreign exchange reached 4.6 billion kronur after
a loss of 759 million kronur a year earlier.  “We still have work to do,” Palsson said. “We must
secure solid, long-term funding no later than 2015, finalize
restructuring customer debt, await the finalization of legal
proceedings on the recalculation of exchange rate indexed loans
and finally increase cost-efficiency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
