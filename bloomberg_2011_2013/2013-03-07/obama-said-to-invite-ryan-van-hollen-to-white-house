President  Barack Obama  invited House
Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Chris Van Hollen, the
panel’s top Democrat, to lunch today as he seeks to restart
talks on a long-term deal to reduce the federal deficit.  The 12:25 p.m. lunch in a private dining room of the
executive mansion was listed on Obama’s official schedule
released by the White House.  Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who was his party’s vice
presidential nominee in 2012, said in a statement he hoped the
lunch with Obama and Van Hollen, a Maryland representative, “is
the beginning of a serious discussion of the challenges we
face.”  The lunch today follows Obama’s dinner last night at a
Washington hotel with a dozen Republican senators. The president
invited them in an effort to resume talks aimed at a long-term
deficit reduction accord.  Ryan said yesterday that he will present on March 12 a
fiscal blueprint outlining how Republicans would eliminate a
deficit projected to reach $978 billion in 2023 without
increased taxes.  Obama says that any deficit reduction deal must be a
balanced package that includes higher taxes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
