New York  Harbor gasoline weakened to
the lowest level in almost a year as  U.S. East Coast imports 
increased and nationwide demand for gasoline declined.  Regional imports rose  104,000 barrels  to 599,000 barrels a
day in the seven days ended March 1, the Energy Information
Administration said yesterday. Demand for the motor fuel fell
2.7 percent to 8.36 million barrels a day. The U.S. gasoline
market is transitioning to summer-grade fuel. Winter grade can’t
be delivered after April 15, when specifications change and
refineries must begin delivering summer-grade gasoline.  “We get more winter fuel than we know what to do with and
the spread collapses,”  Carl Larry, Houston-based president of
Oil Outlooks & Opinions, LLC, said today. “Demand numbers seem
weak.”  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in New York
Harbor weakened 1.75 cents to 25.63 cents below futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:09 p.m. on the East Coast.
That’s the  widest differential  since March 12, 2012, and a fifth
consecutive decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  strengthened 0.13 cent to trade at a
premium of 11.75 to heating oil futures.  Stockpiles of gasoline in the Central Atlantic region,
including New York Harbor, climbed for an 11th week to 33.7
million barrels, the  highest  level since Feb. 24, 2012.  Refining Margins  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York Harbor, or a measure of
refining profitability for gasoline and diesel based on Brent
oil in  Europe , retreated 76 cents to $12.74 a barrel, the first
decline in three days. Refineries on the East Coast  processed 
963,000 barrels a day of crude and other feedstock last week,
compared with 968,000 a week earlier, EIA data show.  U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened for the first time in
four days after a government report showed inventories slipped
2.1 million barrels to 73.4 million last week. Conventional,  87-
octane gasoline ’s discount to futures narrowed by 1.25 cents to
26.25 cents a gallon.  Refineries in the region reduced gross inputs by 283,000
barrels to 7.04 million barrels a day, EIA data showed. The
3-2-1  crack spread  on the Gulf, based on West Texas Intermediate
in Cushing,  Oklahoma , declined 98 cents to $31.20 a barrel.  The same margin for Light Louisiana Sweet oil fell 0.13
cent to $9.95 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
