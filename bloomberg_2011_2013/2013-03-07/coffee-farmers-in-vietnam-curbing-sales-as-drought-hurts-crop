Coffee farmers in  Vietnam , the
world’s biggest producer of the robusta beans used by  Nestle SA (NESN) 
in instant drinks, are limiting sales to seek higher prices amid
a drought that may reduce the next harvest.  Sales probably reached 820,000 metric tons, or 57 percent
of the crop, less than the 60 percent sold a year earlier,
according to the median of 11 trader and shipper estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The harvest that started in October may
have dropped 13 percent to 1.43 million tons from a record 1.65
million tons in 2011-2012, the survey shows.  Reduced supplies from  Asia  may boost robusta prices for a
second year. Exports from  Indonesia , the third-largest producer,
are declining because of increased consumption, a Bloomberg
survey showed last month. Global usage of robusta has expanded
as demand has fallen for the costlier arabica beans, brewed by
 Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , says Macquarie Group Ltd. Growth in consumption
for instant coffee will top that of the roast- and ground-market
from 2012 to 2017, Rabobank International says.  “It’s very difficult to buy beans now as farmers are still
holding back sales in anticipation of higher prices,” said Le
Tien Hung, Dak Lak-based deputy director of Sept. 2nd Import-
Export Co. Dry weather will probably hurt the next crop, so
growers are even more hesitant to sell, he said.  Beans in Dak Lak province, which supplies about a third of
the crop, cost 42,700 dong ($2.04) a kilogram (2.2 pounds)
yesterday,  data  from the Daklak Trade & Tourism Center show. The
price rose to 43,200 dong on March 5, the highest since Oct. 3.  Dry Weather  Water levels at many reservoirs in the central provinces
are only at 20 percent to 50 percent of designed capacity, the
government said Feb. 26, warning the drought may hurt rice and
coffee crops. Farmers irrigate crops by pumping water from
reservoirs and wells before the rainy season starts in May.  Drought in the region covering five growing provinces,
including  Dak Lak , will continue and may become more severe, the
National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said on its
website March 5. Trees in Vietnam usually flower and form fruit
between January and March, according to growers.  Exports from Indonesia may decline to a two-year low as
increasing domestic consumption erodes supplies from a record
harvest, according to a survey published Feb. 28. Shipments will
total 450,000 tons in the 12 months starting April 1. That’s 7.4
percent less than sales of 486,000 tons this year, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Instant Drinks  Global robusta usage rose 11 percent in the 12 months to
September as arabica consumption fell 6.2 percent, Macquarie
said in January. Instant coffee demand will grow 6.5 percent
from 2012 to 2017, more than the 6 percent growth forecast for
the roast- and ground-market, J. Ross Colbert, global strategist
of beverages at Rabobank, said at a meeting of the  International
Coffee Organization , or ICO, in  London  on March 5.  Robusta for delivery in May gained 0.2 percent to $2,118 a
ton on NYSE Liffe in London by 5:16 p.m. Singapore time,
extending this year’s advance to 10 percent. Prices climbed 6.3
percent in 2012 as roasters increased consumption of the beans.
Arabica for May fell 0.3 percent to $1.409 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York .  Robusta’s  discount  to arabica was 44.83 cents a pound, down
21 percent this year after a 61 percent plunge in 2012. The
cheaper variety is harvested mainly in Asia and parts of  Africa ,
while arabica is grown in  Latin America .  Harvests in Asia climbed 13 percent to 41 million bags of
60 kilograms each in 2011-2012, according to the annual report
of the ICO, an intergovernmental organization with 44 members.
The region represented 30.5 percent of global output, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
