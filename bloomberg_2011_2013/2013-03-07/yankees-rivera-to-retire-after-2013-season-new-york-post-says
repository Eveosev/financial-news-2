Mariano Rivera  of the  New York
Yankees , Major League Baseball’s career saves leader, will
announce his plan to retire after this season during a March 9
news conference, the  New York Post reported .  Rivera, 43, signed a one-year contract in December, opting
to return to the Yankees for a 19th season after missing most of
last year because of a knee injury.  A 12-time All-Star and the team’s closer since 1997, Rivera
hinted during spring training a year ago that the 2012 season
might be his last, then vowed to return after the injury. Rivera
has a major-league-record 608 saves and has helped the Yankees
win five World Series titles.  The Yankees have scheduled a 10 a.m. news conference at
their spring training complex in Tampa, Florida, the Post
reported without saying where it got the information. Yankees
officials didn’t immediately return messages seeking comment on
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
