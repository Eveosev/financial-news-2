West Texas Intermediate oil advanced
after U.S. unemployment benefit applications dropped to a six-
week low, bolstering optimism about the country’s economy, and
the dollar weakened against the euro.  Futures climbed 1.3 percent in New York as first-time
jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week. A report tomorrow
may show payrolls grew in February. The dollar declined against
the euro after the  European Central Bank  held its benchmark
interest rate steady, making assets priced in the U.S. currency
more attractive to investors. A North Sea pipeline resumed
operations after a five-day shutdown, weighing on Brent.  “The better-than-expected jobs numbers are giving the
market a boost today,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Crude oil for April delivery rose $1.13 to settle at $91.56
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The volume of all
futures traded was 26 percent above the 100-day average at 3:10
p.m. The contract dropped to $90.12 on March 4, the lowest
settlement this year, and climbed to $97.94 on Jan. 30, the
highest close since Sept. 14.  Brent oil for April settlement rose 9 cents to end the
session at $111.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The volume of all futures traded was 44 percent
higher than the 100-day average. The European benchmark traded
at a $19.59 premium to WTI, down from $20.63 yesterday.  Range-Bound Market  “WTI climbed strongly for the first five or six weeks of
the year, then gave it all back in two weeks,” said  Stephen Schork , the president of Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,
 Pennsylvania . “There was no traction to the downside below $90
a barrel, and $100 is too high to justify. In the short term, we
should head for the upper end of the $90-to-$95 range.”  The number of Americans who filed for  unemployment benefits 
fell by 7,000 to 340,000 in the week ended March 2, according to
data today from the Labor Department in Washington. The  median 
forecast of 50 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an
increase to 355,000. A report tomorrow may show that payrolls
rose by 163,000 last month, a Bloomberg survey showed.  The better-than-expected jobs data helped send the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  to a third straight record. The Dow
rose as much as 0.4 percent to 14,354.69. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index gained 0.2 percent.  Draghi Comments  The dollar retreated as much as 1.2 percent against the
euro to $1.3119 as the ECB kept  interest rates  on hold and its
President  Mario Draghi  said data suggests the economy will
stabilize this year.  “Some of the economic data has been looking better, which
is good for fuel demand,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market
strategist at Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis ,
which oversees $1.4 billion. “Some people were looking for the
ECB to cut rates but that didn’t happen and Draghi doesn’t seem
too concerned about the euro-zone outlook.”  Brent futures lagged. The North Sea pipeline is flowing at
less than full capacity, a spokesman for operator  Abu Dhabi
National Energy Co. PJSC (TAQA) , known as Taqa, said by telephone from
 Abu Dhabi , capital of the United Arab Emirates.  Production from the 27 North Sea fields that make up the
Brent system was shut March 2 after Taqa reported a leak in one
leg of the Cormorant Alpha platform. The pipeline has the
capacity to carry 90,000 barrels a day of oil and 10,000 barrels
a day was already offline after an incident on Jan. 14.  Pipeline Operations  The company didn’t specify when operations resumed at the
pipeline nor did it say when the network would reach the
targeted flow of 80,000 barrels a day.  Weakness in U.S.  oil demand  may be overstated because of
disruptions at pipelines and terminals from  Hurricane Sandy  in
October that have made it difficult for refiners to ship
products, Stefan Wieler, a London-based analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., said in a report yesterday.  The death of Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  on March 5
should have a limited impact on the country’s oil production in
the short term, while new leadership may foster longer-term
investment and boost output, the bank said.  U.S. Stockpiles  U.S. crude supplies climbed  3.83 million barrels  to 381.4
million last week, leaving stockpiles at the highest level since
June, the Energy Information Administration said yesterday.
 Refinery utilization  dropped to 82.2 percent of capacity, the
least since March 16, 2012, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  “WTI is the flavor of the day despite the highly visible
abundance of oil in the U.S.,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “Refineries
are running at very low rates, so supplies should climb further,
which makes the rally in WTI vulnerable.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 582,641
contracts as of 3:09 p.m. It totaled 541,813 contracts
yesterday, 0.7 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was a record 1.71 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
