Lithuanian natural-gas utility
 Lietuvos Dujos (LDJ1L)  AB plans on July 31 to transfer its transmission
activity to AB Amber Grid, a new company that will apply for
permission to trade its shares on the stock exchange in Vilnius.  Terms of the spinoff have been approved by the board of
directors of Lietuvos Dujos and the state energy regulator, the
Vilnius-based company said today in a  statement  on the website
of the Nasdaq OMX Vilnius exchange. A vote on the matter by
shareholders is still pending, it said.  Lithuania  is splitting ownership of gas sales and
transmission activities as part of a European Union drive to
force dominant energy companies to improve access for
competitors.  Germany ’s  EON AG (EOAN)  owns 39 percent of Lietuvos Dujos,
while  Russia ’s  OAO Gazprom (OGZD)  has 37 percent and Lithuania’s Energy
Ministry holds 18 percent.  “The shares of the new company and the company that
continues the activities after the spinoff will be distributed
to all the shareholders in proportion to their shares in the
authorized capital of AB Lietuvos Dujos,” the utility said in
the statement. “There are no legal entities to be wound up
after the spinoff.”  Extra Dividends  Before the division, Lietuvos Dujos proposes paying
shareholders 160 million litai ($60.7 million) of dividends from
reserve capital, in addition to dividends from last year’s
profit, according to  detailed spinoff terms  on the company’s
website.  Unaudited net income in 2012 was 74.5 million litai, 22
percent less than in 2011, the company reported on Feb. 27.
Sales last year grew 1.7 percent from a year earlier to 1.87
billion litai.  Lietuvos Dujos shares rose 11.3 percent to a 12-month high
of 0.65 euro in Vilnius today, valuing the company at 305
million euros ($399 million). Volume of 502,240 shares was the
most in more than three years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Of the existing 469 million shares with a nominal value of
1 litas, 178 million, or 38 percent, will be transferred to
Amber Grid, with 291 million remaining in Lietuvos Dujos,
according to the spinoff terms.  A  spinoff balance sheet , dated Oct. 31, 2012, shows Amber
Grid getting 1.6 billion litai of Lietuvos Dujos’s 2.78 billion
litai assets and 1.21 billion litai of its 2.04 billion litai in
total equity.  The 66 percent stake that Lietuvos Dujos owns in the GET
Baltic natural gas exchange will be split, with a 32 percent
stake going to Amber Grid, spinoff terms show. GET Baltic, a
joint venture with  Finland ’s Gasum Oy that plans to create a
Baltic gas bourse, began trading in Lithuania in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
