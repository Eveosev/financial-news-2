Former Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  leads among prospective 2016 presidential candidates in
a poll out today that shows the Democrat besting New Jersey
Governor  Chris Christie  and two other Republicans.  Christie holds the strongest position among his party’s
potential White House hopefuls. He’s ahead when pitted against
two other Democrats mentioned as White House contenders, Vice
President  Joe Biden  and New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo ,
according to the survey of U.S. voters by Hamden, Connecticut-
based  Quinnipiac University .  “Clinton would start a 2016 presidential campaign with
enormous advantages,” said  Peter Brown , assistant director of
the Quinnipiac polling institute. “She obviously is by far the
best known, and her more than 20 years in the public spotlight
allows her to create a very favorable impression on the American
people. But it is worth noting that she had very good poll
numbers in 2006 looking toward the 2008 election, before she
faced a relative unknown in  Barack Obama .”  Clinton, then a U.S. senator from New York and a former
first lady, lost the 2008 Democratic nomination to Obama, who
was elected president and named her secretary of state.  She left the State Department earlier this year and was
succeeded by  John Kerry , a former Massachusetts senator and the
unsuccessful 2004 Democratic presidential nominee. Clinton, 65,
hasn’t discussed plans to seek public office again, though
supporters have formed a super-political action committee to
back a possible presidential campaign by her.  Clinton Advantage  The Quinnipiac poll showed Clinton leading Christie, 45
percent to 37 percent; Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio,
50 percent to 34 percent; and Representative  Paul Ryan  of
 Wisconsin , his party’s 2012 vice-presidential nominee, 50
percent to 38 percent.  Christie, who is running for re-election as governor in
November, finishes ahead of Biden, 43 percent to 40 percent, and
Cuomo, 45 percent to 28 percent.  The vice president leads both Rubio, 45 percent to 38
percent, and Ryan, 45 percent to 42 percent. Cuomo trails Ryan,
42 percent to 37 percent, and is even with Rubio at 37 percent.  Christie, 50, “runs best of the three Republicans tested
and would defeat two of the top Democrats” and “obviously is
doing better than the Democrats’ rising star,” Cuomo of  New
York , Brown said.  Approval ratings  Obama’s job approval rating stands at 45 percent, with 46
percent disapproving, virtually unchanged from 46 percent
approval and 45 percent disapproval ratings last month.
Congressional Republicans draw an unfavorable rating of 71
percent -- including 53 percent from members of their own party
-- and a favorable rating of 20 percent. That also was
statistically unchanged from the 72 unfavorable and 19 percent
favorable ratings of a month ago.  “The Republican brand is not doing very well these days,”
Brown said.  Gun control measures Obama has proposed in reaction to the
December mass killings of 20 elementary school students and six
adults in Newtown,  Connecticut , are supported by a majority of
poll respondents.  Voters backed Obama’s calls for universal background checks
for all gun purchases, 88 percent to 10 percent; for bans on
military-style assault weapons, 54 percent to 41 percent; and
for prohibitions against selling high-capacity ammunition
magazines, 54 percent to 42 percent.  The survey of 1,944 registered voters was conducted Feb.
27-March 4 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
