Domestic benchmark West Texas
Intermediate  strengthened  by more than $1 a barrel against Brent
crude, and Gulf of Mexico crudes weakened against WTI by similar
amounts on the spot market.  WTI gained $1.04 to a  discount  of $19.59 a barrel against
Brent after a drop in U.S. unemployment applications bolstered
economic optimism and a North Sea pipeline restarted operations
after a five-day shutdown, weighing on Brent. When Brent drops
versus WTI, it typically weakens the value of U.S. grades that
compete with foreign oils priced against Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened $1.20 a
barrel to $21.60 at 2:04 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet dropped 90 cents a
barrel to trade at $21.20 over WTI.  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI dropped by $1.30 to $16.50 a
barrel, while Poseidon’s premium lost $1.35 to $16.60. The
premium for Thunder Horse, which has a lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green, narrowed by 75 cents to
$19.50.  Bakken crude delivered at Clearbrook, Minnesota, weakened
50 cents a barrel to trade at a 25-cent discount to WTI.  Western Canada Select, a heavy blend of oil-sands bitumen,
was unchanged against WTI at a $23.75 discount, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude Sweet weakened 90 cents to
trade at a $5.60 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
