Thousands of Azeris are signing up
on  Facebook Inc. (FB)  to stage a second rally in three months to
protest violence in the former Soviet republic’s armed forces.  A Facebook Inc. page created to coordinate the event shows
that almost 18,000 people accepted the  call  to demonstrate in
the central Fountains Square in the capital, Baku, on March 10,
with more than 150,000 invited to take part.  Azerbaijan’s largely conscription-based army has lost 14
soldiers in non-combat incidents so far this year, according to
Jasur Sumarinli, head of the non-governmental Doctrine Center of
Military Studies, based in Baku. Seventy-seven died last year,
he said by e-mail.  Military service is mandatory for all men aged between 18
and 35 in the Caspian Sea nation, which has a population of more
than 9 million. The government has rejected calls to shift to an
all-volunteer force because of the country’s military standoff
with neighboring  Armenia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
