Wheat rose the most in three weeks
after a government report showed U.S. export sales last week
jumped to a two-month high, signaling improved demand for grain
from the world’s largest shipper. Soybeans and corn gained.  Exporters sold 828,051 metric tons of wheat in the week
through Feb. 28, up 58 percent from 524,914 tons a week earlier,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. That’s the
highest total since Dec. 20. U.S. supplies have become more
appealing for importers after prices dropped 12 percent this
year through yesterday, partly because snow storms are easing
drought conditions in the Great Plains.  “Export sales were pretty big,” Louise Gartner, the owner
of Spectrum Commodities in Beavercreek,  Ohio , said in a
telephone interview. “We’ve had pretty impressive sales numbers
the past couple of months.”  Wheat futures for May delivery gained 1 percent to $6.9075
a bushel at 9:10 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, heading for
the biggest gain since Feb. 15. Last year, concern over drought
damage sent prices up 19 percent, the biggest gain among 24
commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$14.7175 a bushel in  Chicago , heading for a third increase in
four days. The price through yesterday was up 4 percent in 2013.
Corn futures for May delivery advanced 0.1 percent to $6.895 a
bushel on the CBOT, after fluctuating between gains and losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
