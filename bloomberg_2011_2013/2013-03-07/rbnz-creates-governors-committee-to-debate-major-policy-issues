New Zealand ’s central bank is
forming a committee of its governors to debate policy ahead of
decisions on regulation, the currency and  interest rates ,
Governor Graeme Wheeler announced.  “The Governing Committee will maximize the knowledge and
experience of the Governors individually and, as a collective,
rigorously test ideas and build consensus around major policy
decisions,” Wheeler said in a speech in Auckland today. “The
Governor remains solely accountable for those decisions under
the Reserve Bank Act.”  New Zealand’s central bank operates independently of the
government, and the governor makes the decision on interest
rates after taking advice from a committee of officials who
don’t vote and whose minutes aren’t published. Today’s change is
of management rather than governance, Wheeler said.  The  Reserve Bank  will also expand its communications
program to include more on-the-record speeches, and use a wider
range of speakers and communication channels, to help broaden
understanding of its policy choices, he said.  New Zealand’s central bank may increase home buyers’
minimum deposits and enforce tighter conditions on bank balance
sheets, it said in a March 4 consultation document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
