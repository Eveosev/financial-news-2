Malaysia’s ringgit fell to a one-
month low as gains in U.S. equities and speculation that the
European Central Bank will cut interest rates spurred demand for
the greenback.  The U.S. Dollar Index is trading at its strongest level in
more than six months after Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S.
shares reached its highest since 2007. Five out of 61 economists
expect the ECB to lower its policy  rate  by 25 basis points
today, according to a survey by Bloomberg. Malaysia will keep
borrowing costs at 3 percent, a separate poll of 19 economists
showed, before a rate decision due 6 p.m. local time.  The ringgit depreciated 0.2 percent to 3.1098 per dollar as
of 9:53 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.1153, the weakest since Feb.
1. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange-rates used to price options, increased six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.72 percent.  “The dollar is rising because people are expecting the ECB
to ease monetary policy, which will narrow the rate
differential,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a currency
strategist at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The
ringgit’s major support is at 3.1140.”  Government bonds fell. The yield on the 3.418 percent notes
due August 2022 rose one basis point to 3.47 percent, according
to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
