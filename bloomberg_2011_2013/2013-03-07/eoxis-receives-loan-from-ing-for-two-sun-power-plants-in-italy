Eoxis U.K. Ltd., a renewable-energy
investor backed by private equity firm Platina Partners LLP,
received a 21.5 million euro ($28 million) loan from  ING Groep
NV (INGA)  to finance two solar parks in  Italy .  The plants, in Puglia and Campania, have a combined
capacity of 9.45 megawatts, the London-based company said today
in an e-mailed statement. Eoxis bought them last year, and they
were connected to the grid in 2011.  The non-recourse, or secured, loan has a term of 9 1/2
years, according to the statement. The company declined to
provide any further details of the transaction. Solar
photovoltaic technology provides about 5 percent of Italyâ€™s
electricity demand,  according to  the European Photovoltaic
Industry Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
