Daniel Carcillo scored with 50
seconds remaining to give the Chicago Blackhawks a 3-2 win over
the  Colorado Avalanche  and extend their record season-opening
point streak to 24 games.  The Blackhawks have earned at least one point in each of
their first 24 National Hockey League games for 45 points. The
league-leading team has won 11 straight games.  Andrew Shaw gave the Blackhawks the lead on a power play
before  John Mitchell  tied it with one minute, 40 seconds left in
the first period at United Center in Chicago.  Matt Duchene made it 2-1 to the Avalanche (8-10-4, 20
points) in the second period before  Jonathan Toews  tied it with
a shorthanded goal 2:19 into the third period and Carcillo
sealed the win in the final minute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
