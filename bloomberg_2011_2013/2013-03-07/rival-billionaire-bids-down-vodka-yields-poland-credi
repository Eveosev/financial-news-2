Rival offers from Russian
billionaires for rescuing Poland’s second-biggest vodka maker
are spurring speculation  Central European Distribution Corp. (CDC) 
will avoid bankruptcy, sending bond yields to a 10-month low.  Roustam Tariko, CEDC’s biggest shareholder, and Mikhail Fridman’s Alfa Group announced competing proposals to save the
company on March 5 as SPI Group, the owner of the Stolichnaya
Vodka brand, said it hired Nomura Holding Inc. to “evaluate
alternatives with respect to CEDC.” The spirits maker said on
Feb. 25 that without a rescue plan it may file for bankruptcy as
it’s unable to repay $258 million of notes due March 15.  Yields on 2016 Eurobonds of the maker of the Bols, Zubrowka
and Zelyonaya Marka brands tumbled 987 basis points since Feb.
25 to 16.32 percent at 10:27 a.m. in Warsaw, the lowest rate
since May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Corporate Emerging Market High Yield
index fell nine basis points to 6.53 percent in the period.  “Bondholders have more and more options and falling yields
reflect that,” Jakub Krawczyk, an analyst at Raiffeisen
Centrobank AG in Vienna, said by phone on March 6. “This
situation is a kind of end game as CEDC convertible bonds mature
next week. Every scenario is possible.”  Offer Received  Warsaw-based CEDC said in a March 4 statement that it had
received a restructuring proposal from Tariko’s Roust Trading
that’s also supported “by certain bondholders.” CEDC said it’s
evaluating the offer and expects to make a final decision
“within the coming days.” Spokeswoman Anna Zaluska declined to
comment further when contacted by e-mail yesterday.  The offer by Tariko, who owns 19.5 percent of CEDC, and a
committee of bondholders includes a $172 million cash payment as
well as issuance of new debt maturing in 2018 to holders both of
dollar- and euro-denominated bonds maturing in 2016.  SPI, which owns both 2013 and 2016 notes of CEDC, has
started “preliminary discussions with a few strong financial
players in  Russia  who could be interested in considering the
CEDC business together with us,” Val Mendeleev, chief executive
officer of SPI, said in a statement on March 5.  Fridman’s Alfa Group and Mark Kaufman’s consortium A1,
CEDC’s second-largest shareholder, proposed on the same day to
invest as much as $225 million in the vodka maker’s
restructuring in return for 85 percent equity in the reorganized
company. Holders of the 2016 bonds would also be able to
exchange the securities into new bonds maturing in 2018.  Deal Details  CEDC’s offer expires March 22. It would give holders of its
3 percent convertible bonds, due a week before that date, 8.86
new shares in exchange for each $1,000 principal amount of their
notes, the company said.  Investors in 9.125 percent 2016 dollar bonds issued by CEDC
Finance Corporation International Inc. will receive 16.52 new
shares and $508.21 principal of the company’s 2020 debt.  On the 8.875 percent 2016 euro-denominated bonds, holders
are being offered 22.18 new shares for each 1,000 euro principal
amount and $682.37 principal of the 6.5 percent 2020 bonds,
according to the filing. CEDC said it’s also considering a pre-
packaged bankruptcy plan in  Delaware , the filing shows.  CEDC’s shares have tumbled 70 percent in New York and 67
percent in Warsaw  this year .  The price on CEDC’s convertible dollar notes due March 15
fell 3 percent to 16 cents on the dollar in Warsaw yesterday,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Persisting Uncertainty  Investors are “no longer sufficiently paid for the
uncertainty,” Martin Svaerdborg, a bond analyst at Silkeborg,
Denmark-based Jyske Bank A/S, said in a note on March 6.  He downgraded CEDC Eurobonds due 2016 to sell from buy
citing “steep” price increases.  “The liquidity of the new notes that may be issued in
connection with the restructuring cannot be guaranteed,” posing
a risk of not being able to sell at a “reasonable price at a
later point in time.” There’s also “continued uncertainty”
about future operational performance, with development in Russia
“still causing concern,” according to Svaerdborg.  The extra yield investors demand to hold  Poland ’s dollar
bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points to 124
today, JPMorgan’s EMBI Global index showed.  The spread between Poland’s 10-year zloty bond and German
bunds narrowed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
250, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The zloty strengthened 0.1
percent to 4.1464 to the euro, paring its 2013 decline to 1.6
percent, the fifth-biggest among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Debt Insurance  The cost of insuring Polish debt using credit-default swaps
fell 1 basis point to 90. The contracts were 82 basis points
below those from 15 emerging countries from  Europe , the Middle
East and  Africa  in the Markit iTraxx SovX CEEMEA index. That’s
down from a gap of 110 basis points in October.  The swaps, which increase as perceptions of
creditworthiness deteriorate, pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower renege on its debt agreements.  The Warsaw-based distiller has $1.2 billion of  outstanding
bonds , or 25 times more than its market capitalization on the
New York exchange. It sold debt in 2008 and 2009 to help fund
its expansion in Russia, the world’s largest spirits market.  CEDC has reported a  combined net loss  of $1.4 billion for
2010 and 2011 and plans to write down at least $400 million in
2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Bondholders may be betting that some kind of a compromise
is possible and the risk of the company going bankrupt fades,”
Krzysztof Kuper, an analyst at Ipopema Securities SA, said by
phone from Warsaw yesterday. “Investors should still pay the
most attention to proposals from CEDC and Tariko.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
