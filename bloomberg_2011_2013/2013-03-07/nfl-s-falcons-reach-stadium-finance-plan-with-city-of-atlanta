Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and the
 National Football League ’s Falcons agreed on terms for financing
a $1 billion, retractable-roof stadium downtown with a public
contribution capped at $200 million.  Invest Atlanta, the city’s economic development agency,
will sell bonds for the public’s share backed by a hotel tax
that currently supports the Georgia Dome, according to a news
release sent by the city. The Falcons will pay about $800
million, including $50 million for infrastructure improvements.  “I am pleased that we reached an agreement that will
ensure the  Atlanta Falcons  remain in the heart of our city for
many years to come and will lead to revitalization of some of
the city’s most historic neighborhoods,” Reed said in the
release. “Equally important, a new stadium will lead to the
creation of well-paying jobs during construction at a time when
many of our friends and neighbors are seeking employment.”  The proposal requires approval by the Atlanta City Council.  Team owner Arthur Blank, co-founder of  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , has
said the team will sell personal-seat licenses to help pay its
share of the cost. Blank bought the Falcons for $545 million in
February 2002 and has said the team needs a new stadium to
attract big events such as the NFL’s Super Bowl.  The 20-year-old Georgia Dome, the Falcons’ current home
field, hosts the Southeastern Conference college football
championship game each year and will be the site of the 2013
college basketball Final Four tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
