BP Plc (BP/)  Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley was denied a bonus in shares for last year after the
company’s profit dropped and the stock slipped 8 percent.  Dudley’s remuneration, not including pension contributions,
fell 21 percent to $2.7 million in 2012, BP said in its annual
report late yesterday. Iain Conn, head of BP’s refining and
marketing unit, received 666,000 pounds ($998,000) in
performance shares, and Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary
received 299,000 pounds in shares.  Dudley has tried to revive BP after the slump following the
2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill by selling $38 billion in assets
and shutting down production in many areas to ensure safety,
causing output to decline 7 percent last year. The share price
is still about a third lower than before the spill.  “Overall group performance was assessed at just below
target,” said remuneration chairman Antony Burgmans in the
annual report. On metrics for the share bonus, which included
shareholder return, production and profit as compared to peers,
“performance failed to meet the level required for vesting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
