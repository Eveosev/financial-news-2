Natural gas futures rose for the
second time in three days before a government report that may
show an above-average stockpile decline.  Gas gained as much as 1.2 percent before the Energy
Information Administration report, which may show an inventory
drop of 130 billion cubic feet last week, based on the median of
21 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Boston may get 4 to
6 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) of snow from a wet, windy storm
that dropped about 9 inches in  Chicago .  “All eyes are going to be on the inventory report,” said
Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc. in  New York . “We had a pretty cool end to
the winter season that helped produce these bigger-than-normal
withdrawals. The storm that has been drifting across the country
for several days has definitely sparked demand.”  Natural gas for April delivery increased 3.2 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.503 per million British thermal units at 9:16
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 33
percent below the 100-day average for the time of day. The
futures have gained 4.5 percent this year.  The EIA is scheduled to release its weekly gas storage
report 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
