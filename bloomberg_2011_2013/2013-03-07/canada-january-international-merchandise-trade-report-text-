The following is the text of
 Canada ’s international merchandise trade report for January
from  Statistics Canada .  Canada’s merchandise exports rose 2.1% in January and imports
increased 1.9%. As a result, Canada’s trade deficit with the
world narrowed from $332 million in December to $237 million in
January.  Exports rose to $39.1 billion, as prices increased 1.3% and
volumes were up 0.9%. The main contributors to the monthly gain
in exports were crude oil and crude bitumen as well as unwrought
precious metals and precious metal alloys. A decline in exports
of passenger cars and light trucks partially offset the overall
increase.  Imports increased to $39.3 billion, almost entirely the
result of higher volumes (+1.8%). Imports of energy products
contributed the most to the overall increase, followed by metal
ores and non-metallic minerals.  Exports to the  United States  rose 2.6% to $29.0 billion in
January, on the strength of crude oil and crude bitumen. Imports
increased 2.1% to $24.7 billion. Consequently, Canada’s trade
surplus with the United States grew from $4.0 billion in
December to $4.3 billion in January.  Exports to countries other than the United States increased
0.9% to $10.1 billion, as a result of a 14.0% gain in exports to
the European Union. Imports from countries other than the United
States rose 1.5% to $14.6 billion. As a result, Canada’s trade
deficit with countries other than the United States went from
$4.4 billion in December to $4.5 billion in January.  Exports of energy products, and metal and non-metallic mineral
products lead overall gain  Exports of energy products increased 6.7% to $9.2 billion
in January. Contributing the most to the gain was crude oil and
crude bitumen (+9.5%), almost entirely on higher volumes.
Volumes of crude oil and crude bitumen rose for a third
consecutive month.  Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products rose
10.5% to $5.1 billion. Leading the increase was unwrought
precious metals and precious metal alloys, which recorded a
36.2% increase as a result of higher volumes.  A 7.4% gain in volumes pushed basic and industrial chemical,
plastic and rubber products up 5.6% to $3.0 billion. Leading the
overall gain were exports of dyes and pigments; petrochemicals
(+38.3%) as well as basic chemicals (+16.8%). Lower exports of
lubricants and other petroleum refinery products partially
offset the section’s increase.  Exports of motor vehicles and parts fell 7.6% to $5.1
billion in January, the result of widespread decreases in
volumes. Contributing the most to the overall decline were lower
exports of passenger cars and light trucks (-7.9%), followed by
motor vehicle engines and motor vehicle parts (-7.6%).  Exports of metal ores and non-metallic mineral products
decreased 16.0% to $1.4 billion, entirely a result of lower
volumes (-22.5%). The main contributor to the overall decline
was exports of copper ores and concentrates, down 56.3%.  Imports increase on higher volumes  Imports of energy products rose 11.8% to $4.3 billion in
January, as a result of widespread increases. Crude oil and
crude bitumen led the advance, up 12.0% to $2.9 billion, largely
on higher volumes (+9.6%).  Imports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals grew 36.5%
to $1.1 billion, the highest value since reaching a record high
in August 2011. Imports of metal ores and concentrates
contributed the most to the monthly gain, entirely the result of
higher volumes.  Imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts rose
5.3% to $3.6 billion, as a result of widespread increases.
Leading the gains were imports of other general-purpose
machinery and equipment, mainly turbines and turbine generator
sets, rising 8.4% to $1.1 billion on higher volumes (+8.0%).  Metal and non-metallic mineral products imports declined
10.8% to $3.2 billion in January, their lowest level since
February 2011. Imports of unwrought precious metals and precious
metal alloys, down 37.9%, were the main contributor to the
monthly decrease, almost entirely the result of lower volumes.  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States,  Japan  and the  United Kingdom . Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula (2007=100).  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010 -
X201000311141&amp;lang=eng) .  The Canadian international merchandise trade data are now
available on average 35 days after the end of the reference
month, 5 days earlier than previously. For further information,
consult the release date calendar
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/release-diffusion/2013-eng.htm#a6 ) .  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data are revised with the
release of the January, February and March reference months.
Revisions to BOP based data for the previous three years are
released annually in June with the April reference month.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
section with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables.  To contact the reporter on this story:
