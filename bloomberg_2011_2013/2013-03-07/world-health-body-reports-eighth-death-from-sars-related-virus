A 69-year-old man in Saudi Arabia
died after being infected with a new SARS-related virus,
becoming the 14th confirmed case and the eighth death, the World
Health Organization said.  Preliminary investigations indicated the patient had no
contact with previously reported cases of infection with the
novel coronavirus, the Geneva-based WHO said in a  statement  on
its website yesterday. Seven of the 14 confirmed cases, and five
of the eight deaths, have been reported from Saudi Arabia, the
United Nations health agency said.  Coronaviruses are a family of pathogens that cause
illnesses ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which sickened more than 8,000
people and killed 774 in 2002 and 2003, according to the WHO.
While the new virus is related to the one that causes SARS, it
appears far less transmissible,  the WHO has said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
