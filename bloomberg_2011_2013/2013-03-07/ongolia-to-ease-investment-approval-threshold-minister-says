Mongolia is planning to ease a key
restriction on foreign investment by raising by tenfold the size
of deals that must be approved by parliament, the nation’s
foreign minister said in an interview.  The threshold will be raised to 1 trillion tugrik ($715
million) from 100 billion tugrik, Luvsanvandan Bold said, adding
that the decision would please foreign investors hoping to do
business in Mongolia.  “Today it will be debated in Parliament,” the minister
said. “It will be raised to 1 trillion tugrik. That is the new
level that is under discussion.”  Mongolia, in the midst of a dispute with  Rio Tinto (RIO)  Group
over control of the $6.6 billion Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold
project, passed a law last May to restrict foreign companies
from buying control of assets in industries including mining,
telecommunications, media and financial services. The law was
created in part as a response to Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.’s
plan to buy coal miner  SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ)   The Strategic Entities Foreign Investment Law requires any
deal worth more than 100 billion tugrik involving the transfer
of more than 49 percent of a Mongolian company to a foreign
group to be referred to parliament for approval.  SouthGobi later came under Rio Tinto’s control after it
took a majority stake in its parent company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
