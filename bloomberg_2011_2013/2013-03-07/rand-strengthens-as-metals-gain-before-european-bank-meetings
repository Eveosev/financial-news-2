The rand reached its weakest level
in almost four years as labor protests at mines spurred concern
of a repeat of violence that curbed production last year.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy lost as much as
0.7 percent to 9.1884 per dollar, the lowest intraday level
since April 2009, and traded 0.1 percent lower at 9.1362 by 4:22
p.m. in Johannesburg. Yields on benchmark government 10.5
percent bonds due December 2026 rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.338 percent.  Workers downed tools at  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) ’s Matla and
Arnot mines, the company said in a statement today. South Africa
has been rocked by labor unrest following a wage dispute at
 Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana operations in August, which led to 34
people being shot dead by police.  “There is continued pressure on the rand from labor
disruptions,” Ion de Vleeschauwer, the Johannesburg-based chief
dealer at Bidvest Bank Ltd., said by phone. “Exxaro also has
issues now.”  Mining accounts for two-thirds of exports in  South Africa ,
the continent’s largest gold producer, makes up about 9 percent
of gross domestic product and directly employs about 500,000 of
the nation’s 51.8 million people.  The rand is the third-worst performing currency this year,
behind the Japanese yen and British pound, among 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  An appreciation of the rand in the short term is
“unlikely,” de Vleeschauwer said. The currency isn’t cheap at
these levels, he said.  “9.25 rand is a cheap rand and 8.75 rand is the new
expensive rand,” Malcolm Charles, who helps manage about $3.3
billion in fixed-income securities at Investec Asset Management,
said at a presentation in Johannesburg today.  The rand’s three-month implied volatility against the
dollar rose to 13.04 percent, from 12.83 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
