Narendra Modi , 62, has been the chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat for almost 12 years, and will almost certainly run for prime minister in next year's general elections. It was an incident of no small consequence, then, when Modi's invitation to deliver, via videoconference,  the keynote address  at the University of Pennsylvania's annual  Wharton India Economic Forum  was abruptly rescinded earlier this week, after Indian-American academics circulated a petition criticizing his human-rights record. And therein lies a tale of two extremes. Gujarat under Modi has an impressive record of economic growth, infrastructure development and delivery of public goods such as  primary education . It is also India's most popular  industrial and investment destination , as a result of proactive initiatives such as Modi's  Vibrant Gujarat , an annual summit for  investors . Modi has become a youth icon, standing out recently in Indian political life for emphasizing growth and good governance over the politics of identity and welfarism. A charismatic speaker, Modi now draws crowds beyond his usual base supporters in his  right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party , whose politics lean toward overt or covert Hindu majoritarianism and other expedient positions. He is admired by large numbers among India's middle class and its youth, who see him as a decisive strongman in a climate of democratic dithering and conspicuous corruption. And he is praised by captains of industry, who appreciate Modi's unambiguously pro-business slant in a country where politicians are wary of aligning themselves with industry.  At  a recent speech  at a college in New Delhi, Modi was applauded by students when he said: "The 21st century belongs to us. We just need to rebrand our country." That message both soothes and inspires Indians, who no longer want to be seen as a people marked by poverty, underdevelopment, fatalism and dependence. Except that it isn't just Gujarat, or India, that Modi has been trying to rebrand, but himself. Like Lady Macbeth, he has a "damned spot" on his hands -- one that he can never erase, only evade. The blemish is the horrific religious strife that occurred in his state  in February and March of 2002 . Hundreds were killed and property worth millions of rupees was destroyed -- the worst advertisement possible for business. Modi was widely held responsible for failing to stanch  the brutal violence  visited on the state's Muslim population -- a perception he stoked by plotting a return to power in state elections later that year with a campaign marked by  crude remarks against Muslims that bordered on hate speech .  Modi soon realized he had painted himself into a corner. Over the next decade, he worked relentlessly to reinvent himself as a statesman focused not on "Hindus" and "Muslims" but on "governance" and "development" (he used that last word  20 times  in a recent speech). He has been reprimanded by India's courts for his role in the 2002 violence and the obstruction of justice that followed, but has never yet been actually found guilty of criminal conspiracy or negligence. He hasn't  been allowed to shake off the infamy of 2002 , though, by India's many committed human-rights groups and by journalists, academics and political commentators.  And this was why Modi was made  the subject of a petition protesting  his invitation to deliver the speech at the Wharton forum, an annual event in its 18th year  dedicated to discussing  "India's evolution from an emerging nation to a prominent global economic power, and the key social, political and financial challenges which still stand in its way." Written by three Indian-Americans at the University of Pennsylvania and signed by more than 100 other people, the petition said: The vehemence of this denunciation, the ambiguity of that final phrase "a variety of ways" and the fact that the petitioners were also from the university community led the forum to withdraw the invitation to Modi. The organizing committee  explained : Since this kerfuffle, many searching questions were asked both of the forum's student-organizers and of the petitioners. The organizers were accused of not standing their ground, and of evading the central questions posed by their challengers. The Wharton alumnus Manish Sabharwal wrote in  "B-School basics: Why Wharton is wrong in disinviting Narendra Modi" : The protestors were accused of demonizing a man who hasn't been found guilty in a court of law, and of obstructing his right to free speech as well as the right of an audience to hear his views on Indian business. Further, their arguments seemed not only to link Modi's successes with his human-rights record (a legitimate tactic), but also to endorse a certain view of business and "economic organization" that may not be shared by the Wharton School of Business. Aseem Shukla, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, seized on this aspect  in a piece criticizing the protests : But the Wharton professor of English Ania Loomba, one of the main forces behind the petition, suggested that the invitation to Modi was not as disinterested and detached as it was made out to be by the organizers.  She pointed out  that the event was supported by corporate sponsors, and the invitation was a way of insidiously overturning the negative perception of Modi in the U.S.: One might grant this, and yet see that Ron Somers, the chairman of the  U.S.-India Business Council  and a delegate at the forum WIEF, made a valid point when he  criticized the cancellation : I agree. Modi clearly has  a lot to answer for , and though he was silent in this instance, in the past he has himself shrewdly played the victim card  when the chance has presented itself . But he is more complex than he is made out to be by both his detractors and his supporters. The Indian journalist Shoma Chaudhury  described him as  "a complex cocktail of high intelligence, high ambition, high capacities, high efficiencies, high demagoguery, high vengefulness and high megalomania."  Democratic politics often produce polarizing figures, as Americans well know. But when citizens and human-rights groups want to ensure that politicians are held accountable to the rule of law, they also agree implicitly to abide by the rules of democratic legitimacy and the codes and courtesies of free speech. By trying to make Modi a political untouchable, his critics in universities produce the very climate of indoctrination and suffocation they often so bravely defy.
