Texas  regulators may wait until
after August to decide whether more changes to the state’s power
market are needed to spur new generation projects.  “We’re moving forward on a lot of fronts right now,”
Public Utility Commission of Texas Chairman Donna Nelson said at
the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston today. “By the fall of
this year I would expect we’d have all the information where we
could make a decision on the big questions.”  Texas may be at risk of blackouts if there is an extreme
heat wave this summer, the Electric Reliability Council of
Texas, which operates most of the state’s grid, said last week.
Regulators are considering additional financial incentives for
power producers as the state has said that electricity supplies
are expected to fall below targets amid economic and population
growth.  Texas regulators have been raising the price cap for
wholesale electricity to encourage investment in new power
plants. Last year, the state utility commission approved
doubling the cap, which is typically reached during the hottest
days or a sudden shortage of supplies, from $4,500 a megawatt-
hour to $9,000 by June 1, 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
