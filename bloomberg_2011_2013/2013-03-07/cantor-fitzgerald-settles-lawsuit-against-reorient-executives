Cantor Fitzgerald LP and four
managing directors who left to join a China-backed investment
bank  Reorient Group Ltd. (376)  agreed to settle their lawsuit,
according to a Hong Kong stock exchange statement.  Reorient said it has been informed by Jason Boyer, Bradford Ainslie, Brett McGonegal and Uwe Parpart that Cantor wonâ€™t
proceed with its planned appeal of a Hong Kong judgment that
dismissed its claims.  The  Europe  and Hong Kong units of Cantor had sought HK$8.7
million ($1.1 million) in damages from the four executives,
accusing them of breaching their employment contracts and
causing a 29 percent drop in its average monthly revenue in the
city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
