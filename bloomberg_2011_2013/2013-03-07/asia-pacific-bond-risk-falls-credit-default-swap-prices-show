The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index slid 2 basis points to 111.5
as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The gauge
is dropping for a seventh straight day, a streak of declines
that has taken it to the lowest close since March 2011,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 103.5 basis points
as of 8:50 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The benchmark is on track for its lowest close
since Jan. 7, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 1 basis point to
111 basis points as of 11:27 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The measure has fallen 16.5 basis
points this year, according to NAB and CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
