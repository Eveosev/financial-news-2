Qatar plans to sell 4 billion riyals
($1.1 billion) of three-year and five-year bonds and sukuk as
the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas starts
quarterly sales to build a local yield curve.  The Arab country’s central bank will offer local banks 3
billion riyals of bonds and 1 billion riyals of Shariah-
compliant notes, state-run Qatar News Agency said in a
statement. The local-currency issuances will take place
quarterly, QNA reported, without specifying how much of each
maturity would be sold. The sale will take place March 10,
Central Bank Governor Sheikh Abdullah Saud Al Thani said.  “It’s for liquidity management,” the governor said by
phone today. The regulator wants to “extend the yield curve”
beyond what is covered by treasury bills maturing in less than a
year, he said. The three-year bonds will be priced to yield 2.75
percent and five-year securities at 3 percent, the governor
said.  Qatar is creating a local debt market to provide a
benchmark for pricing corporate bonds. The country began issuing
treasury bills with three-month, six-month and nine-month
maturities in May 2011. Qatar’s government and companies are
tapping debt markets to finance expansion as the nation embarks
on more than $130 billion of investments before hosting the 2022
soccer  World Cup .  The nation’s issuers sold almost $10 billion of bonds last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
