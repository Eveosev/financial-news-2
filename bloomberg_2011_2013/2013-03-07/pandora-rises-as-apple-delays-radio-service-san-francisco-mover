Pandora Media Inc. (P) , the Internet
radio service, rose as much as 4.2 percent after  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
delayed plans to start a competing music service.  Pandora gained 1.5 percent to $11.85 at 2:11 p.m. in New
York trading after reaching as high as $12.16. The stock had
climbed 27 percent this year as of yesterday. Pandora plans to
report fiscal fourth-quarter results today after markets close.  Talks between Apple and record companies have stalled,
pushing back the Cupertino, California-based company’s plans to
start an advertising supported radio service until later this
year, people with knowledge of the situation said.  Apple had sought to start the service by April. Unlike
Apple, Oakland, California-based Pandora doesn’t seek agreements
with record companies, relying instead on a compulsory royalty
system run through the Library of Congress.  Apple is asking music labels for rates that are half what
Pandora pays, the  New York  Post reported earlier today. Apple
has offered to pay 6 cents per 100 songs, compared with 12 cents
for Pandora, the newspaper wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
