India’s government will probably
have a 750 billion rupee ($13.7 billion) cash balance at the
start of the next fiscal year after reining in spending, a
Finance Ministry official with knowledge of the matter said.  The money will assist the government in paring the  budget
deficit  in the year starting April 1, the official said, asking
not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The
government plans to achieve 60 percent to 65 percent of its
market-borrowing target for the year by September, the official
said, adding the calendar for debt sales may be set by the
ministry and the central bank in the third week of March.  The nation may issue inflation-indexed bonds for the first
time in April, using the  wholesale-price index  to gauge the rise
in the cost of living, the official said. Another Finance
Ministry official confirmed the wholesale measure is likely to
be used, asking not to be identified as the plan isn’t public.  The government in the Feb. 28 budget set a target for
record gross borrowing of 6.29 trillion rupees in the year to
March 2014, to help fund a jump in spending on the poor before
elections due by 2014. At the same time, the administration is
relying on higher tax revenues, asset sales and subsidy cuts to
trim the fiscal shortfall and avert a credit-rating downgrade.  “In the first quarter normally revenues are not that high,
but with this kind of balance, the government will be able to
spend,” said Prasanna Ananthasubramanian, an economist at ICICI
Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. in Mumbai.  Inflation Bonds  Benchmark 10-year government bonds erased gains on concern
supply starting next month will damp demand for debt. The yield
on the 8.15 percent note due June 2022 rose to 7.86 percent from
7.85 percent earlier, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The BSE  India  Sensitive Index rose 0.1 percent as of
2:05 p.m. in Mumbai. The rupee strengthened 0.3 percent to 54.57
per dollar, climbing for a second day.  The plan for inflation bonds is part of a push to wean
Indians off purchasing gold as a hedge against price increases.
Imports of the precious metal stoked a record  current-account
deficit  of $22.31 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30.  The wholesale-price index rose 6.62 percent in January from
a year earlier, the slowest pace in more than three years. A
separate  consumer-price gauge  surged 10.79 percent, one of the
fastest rates in the world.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram last week set a
goal of narrowing India’s fiscal deficit, which is the widest in
major emerging nations, to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product
in 2013-2014, from 5.2 percent. The target for gross borrowing,
excluding a planned debt switch and buyback, is 5.79 trillion
rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
