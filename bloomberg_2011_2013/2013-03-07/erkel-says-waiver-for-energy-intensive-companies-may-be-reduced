German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
signaled she may reduce power-grid fee waivers for companies
that use large amounts of energy as the European Union probes
the practice over concerns it may be an illegal government
subsidy.  Germany is in “very intensive talks” with the European
Commission, the EU’s executive body, and is revising regulation
related to the exemptions, Merkel told reporters in Berlin
today. The government seeks to come up with “a fair system”
that doesn’t put at a disadvantage German companies that are
competing globally and identifies those industries that aren’t,
she said.  The commission said yesterday that it is probing the
exemptions, worth 300 million euros ($393 million) last year,
following complaints from consumer groups, energy companies and
others. The EU said it was concerned that it gave German
companies an unfair advantage over rivals elsewhere. The waiver
is financed by a levy paid by other consumers.  Germany  is confident the waivers do not constitute illegal
subsidies as they aren’t financed with tax money, Economy
Minister Philipp Roesler said at the same event. The new
regulation could take effect “this summer,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
