Sweden ’s krona strengthened to a
six-month high against the euro after Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves signaled he was little concerned about its strength.  The krona gained as much as 0.36 percent against the euro
to 8.2996, the highest level since Aug. 29, and was up 0.33
percent as of 10:42 am in  Stockholm . It appreciated 0.9 percent
versus the dollar to 6.369 and climbed against all major
currencies in a basket compiled by Bloomberg.  The level of the krona is “not in any way remarkable,”
Ingves said in a hearing in the Swedish parliament today. The
krona is about at the level it ought to be, he said.  Sweden’s krona has appreciated over the past month after
economic data have suggested Sweden’s recovery is gaining pace
and as policy makers have signaled they won’t interfere with
gains in the krona. Swedish  consumer confidence  improved for a
second month in February while seasonally adjusted unemployment
held at 8 percent in January.  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for Sweden rose to
90.7 yesterday from a negative 1.4 Jan. 28, according to pricing
compiled by Bloomberg. A positive reading indicates that
economic releases have on balance beat consensus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
