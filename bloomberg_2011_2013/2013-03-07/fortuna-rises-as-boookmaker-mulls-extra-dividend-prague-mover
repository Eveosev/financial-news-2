Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA)  rose
for a third day, closing at the highest in more than six months,
after the Czech bookmaker said it may pay an extra dividend.  Full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization jumped 11 percent to 22.1 million euros ($28.8
million), Amsterdam-registered Fortuna said today, beating the
21 million-euro median estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The company said it will pay all of 2012 net income -
- 12.3 million euros -- to shareholders and will consider an
extra dividend from retained profit generated in previous years.  “We consider the results positive on all levels,” Milan Lavicka, an analyst at Prague-based J&T Banka AS, wrote in an e-
mailed report to clients.  The stock added as much as 2.3 percent and ended the day up
1.2 percent at 93 koruna, its highest close since Aug. 28 and
the best performance today in the country’s  PX (PX)  index. The number
of shares changing hands was about 251 percent of the daily
average over the past three months.  Lavicka has a buy recommendation on Fortuna, with a price
estimate of 136 koruna.  Net income fell 7.5 percent from a year earlier after the
Czech Republic introduced new gambling taxes, Fortuna said
today. The total amount staked by clients jumped 14 percent to
468 million euros in 2012, boosting revenue by 7.1 percent to
96.2 million euros.  The proposed 100 percent payout from the 2012 profit would
imply a dividend of about 0.237 euros per share, above the 0.22
euros expected by the market, said  Josef Nemy , an analyst at
 Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  in  Prague , in e-mailed comments. He also has a
buy recommendation for Fortuna, with a 99 koruna price target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
