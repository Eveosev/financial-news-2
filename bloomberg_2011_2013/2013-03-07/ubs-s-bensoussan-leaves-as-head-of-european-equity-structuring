Eric Bensoussan, European head of
equity structuring at  UBS AG (UBSN)  in London, has left the bank,
according to two people familiar with the departure who asked
not to be identified because the information is private.  Bensoussan joined Switzerland’s largest bank in 2011. He
previously headed structuring teams at Deutsche Bank AG and
Credit Lyonnais SA, which merged with  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  in
2003. Hana Dunn, a spokeswoman for UBS in London, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
