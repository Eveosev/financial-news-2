John Lewis Partnership Plc, owner of
the U.K.’s largest department-store chain, said annual earnings
rose 16 percent and increased its staff bonus amid surging
online revenue and higher sales of electronics products.  Pretax profit climbed to 410 million pounds ($615 million)
in the year ended Jan. 26, after declining to 354 million pounds
a year earlier, the employee-owned company said today. The staff
bonus was raised by 28 percent to 211 million pounds.  The retailer has extended the product range on its website
and rolled out collection points in its department stores and
Waitrose supermarkets to make shopping more convenient for
customers. Sales growth will decelerate this year as the
consumer environment “remains subdued,” the company said.  “We expect our sales growth to continue this year, albeit
less strongly than in 2012/13,” the retailer said.  Sales in the first five weeks of the current fiscal year
rose 11 percent. The Waitrose grocery chain increased sales 8.1
percent, while revenue at John Lewis department stores gained 16
percent, or 14 percent at stores open at least a year.  The  British Retail Consortium  reported February retail
sales growth was the strongest in three years, rising 2.7
percent on a same-store basis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
