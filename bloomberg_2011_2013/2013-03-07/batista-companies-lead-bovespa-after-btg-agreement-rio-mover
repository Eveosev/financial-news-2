MMX Mineracao (MMXM3)  & Metalicos SA and  OGX
Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes SA,  Eike Batista ’s mining and oil
companies, led gains in Brazil’s benchmark index after the
billionaire’s holding EBX Group Co. signed a financing agreement
with  Grupo BTG Pactual. (BBTG11)   MMX jumped 16 percent to 3.61 reais at 11:21 a.m. in Sao
Paulo today and OGX gained 15 percent to 3.36 reais after rising
as much as 20 percent, the biggest intraday increase since Sept.
30, 2008. The stocks were the two best performers on Brazil’s
Bovespa index, which advanced 1.5 percent today. LLX Logistica
SA, Batista’s port developer unit, was the third-biggest gainer
in the Bovespa after rising 11 percent.  “Funds have been underweight in Eike’s companies,” Dany Rappaport, who helps manage 250 million reais ($127 million) at
Investport in Sao Paulo, said by phone. “There was short
covering, it was a reversal” after the BTG announcement.  Batista, 56, signed a so-called strategic cooperation
agreement with billionaire Andre Esteves’s BTG for financial
advice, lines of credit and future long-term capital investments
in projects, EBX said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The 56-year-old entrepreneur is seeking to raise money,
including through the sale of assets, to boost output at
existing projects. His oil business cut production targets in
June, fueling additional declines at six publicly traded
companies he owns.  To contact the reporters on this story:
