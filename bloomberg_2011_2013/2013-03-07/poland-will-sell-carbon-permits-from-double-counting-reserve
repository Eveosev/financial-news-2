Poland  hired  Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) 
to sell European Union carbon allowances on that were set aside
to prevent double-counting of emission reductions.  The auction will be held on April 2, according to an e-
mailed statement from bourse.  The 210,417 metric tons of permits are from a reserve set
up because the nation cuts greenhouse gases through Joint
Implementation projects overseen by the  United Nations ,
according to a March 2  statement  by the Polish emissions agency.  For each JI credit created, an EU allowance from the
reserve is canceled, according to the blocâ€™s rules. The reserve
was set up before nations knew the number of credits that would
be created in the five years through 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
