Hunting Plc (HTG) , a U.K. oil-services
provider, expects a “slow” first half because of weak demand
in the U.S. It has a better outlook for the rest of the year.  “The first six months is going to be slow, especially in
the U.S. with the rig count and the economy,” Chief Financial
Officer  Peter Rose  said today by telephone from London, where
the company is based. There’ll be an “uptick” in the last six
months, he said.  The shares dropped 2.8 percent to 905.50 pence at the close
in London, valuing the company at 1.3 billion pounds ($2
billion). Volumes traded were three times higher than the three-
month average.  Active onshore rigs in the U.S. declined by 13 percent last
year, according to Hunting. Offshore rigs increased by 19
percent in the U.S. as drilling resumed in the  Gulf of Mexico 
and by 6 percent elsewhere, it said. Exploration at sea will
remain strong as stable  oil prices  encourage companies to search
for new deposits or extend the life of existing fields.  The company boosted profits before tax to 80.7 million
pounds last year compared with 38.8 million in 2011. Net debt
fell 25 percent to 163.8 million pounds, it said today in an
earnings statement.  Hunting will be looking at bolt-on acquisitions to expand
operations, Rose said. It will stop investing in its exploration
and production division, which includes minority equity stakes
in about 50 oil and gas wells in the southern U.S., he said.  The subsea unit is “poised for a year of good growth
driven by increased offshore global rig counts,” the company
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
