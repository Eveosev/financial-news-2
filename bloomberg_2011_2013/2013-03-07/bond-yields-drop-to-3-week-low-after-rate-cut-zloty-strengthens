The yields on Polish  government
bonds  slumped to a three-week low and the zloty recovered from
the steepest decline in six weeks after the central bank
unexpectedly cut  interest rates  to a record low yesterday.  The  yield  on Poland’s two-year bonds fell eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.39 percent at 11:47 a.m.
in Warsaw today, the lowest level since Feb. 15. The yield
tumbled nine basis points yesterday after the central bank cut
rates by 50 basis points to 3.25 percent, exceeding market
expectations of a quarter-point reduction.  “It often happens that when the central bank surprises the
market, adjusting to new levels takes some time,” Marek Kaczor,
head of fixed income and derivatives at Poland’s top lender PKO
BP SA, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  The  Finance Ministry  will hold a switch auction today at
which it will offer 10-year and 16-year bonds as well as
floating rate notes due in January 2024 in return for debt
maturing from April to October this year.  The zloty strengthened 0.1 percent to 4.1435 per euro,
after a drop of 0.5 percent yesterday. Central bank Governor
Marek Belka said the policy council switched to a “wait-and-
see” approach after reducing borrowing costs.  “The council’s reluctance to ease is supportive for the
zloty, but weak data ahead should still be a reminder that a
single easing is possible, so the zloty should be range bound
between 4.13-4.18,”  Bank Zachodni WBK SA (BZW)  economists, led by
 Maciej Reluga , wrote in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
