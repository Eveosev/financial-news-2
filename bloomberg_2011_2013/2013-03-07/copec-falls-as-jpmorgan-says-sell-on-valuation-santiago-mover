Empresas Copec SA (COPEC) , Chile’s largest
pulp exporter, fell to a two-month low after JPMorgan Chase &
Co. recommended selling the stock, citing high valuation and
slower growth prospects than its regional peers.  Copec dropped 1.7 percent to 7,970 pesos at 4:25 p.m. in
Santiago, its lowest level on a closing basis since Jan. 8. The
benchmark Ipsa index fell 0.5 percent.  JPMorgan initiated coverage of the stock with a rating
equivalent to sell and a year-end price target of 7,300 pesos,
saying the stock’s valuation isn’t “compelling” even when
taking into account growth prospects, analysts Lucas Ferreira
and Rodolfo R. De Angele said in a research note to clients.  “The lack of clear stock catalysts should limit re-rating
potential, while valuation remains close to a cyclical peak,”
the analysts wrote.  Copec is trading at 27.6 times its estimated earnings,
above its five-year average ratio of 21.8, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Klabin SA (KLBN4)  and  Duratex SA (DTEX3)  will show higher
returns, JPMorgan said in the note.  JPMorgan also initiated coverage of  Empresas CMPC SA (CMPC) ,
Chile’s second-largest pulp exporter, with the equivalent of a
hold rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
