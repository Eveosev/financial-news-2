Chinese stocks  rose in  New York  as
 NQ Mobile (NQ)  Inc. surged to a 10-month high after raising its 2013
revenue forecast.  China Lodging Group Ltd. (HTHT)  sank the most on
record as fourth-quarter profit trailed estimates.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese equities in the U.S. added 0.2 percent to 94.13 in New
York. NQ Mobile, the nation’s biggest mobile-phone security
company, jumped to the highest level since May 11, while  Vipshop
Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  climbed for the first time in six days. China
Lodging plunged 14 percent after reporting fourth-quarter net
income 36 percent below the average of four analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  NQ Mobile raised its 2013 sales outlook yesterday to as
much as $183 million from an earlier forecast of up to $155
million. The company also said March 4 that it will partner with
Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s America Movil SAB. American
depositary receipts of the Beijing-based company are poised for
a 45 percent rally this week, a record jump.  “Everything seems to be clicking in the right direction,”
Fred Ziegel, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets Inc. who rates
NQ Mobile buy, said by phone from Petoskey, Michigan. “Despite
the big move here in the last few days, we think the stock can
still more than double.”  ‘More Confidence’  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., added 0.2 percent to $38.57.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2 percent to 1,544.26.  NQ Mobile’s ADRs rose 14 percent to $10.01 on volume more
than 11 times the daily average over the past three months,
bringing its advance this year to 66 percent.  The company’s increased revenue forecast takes into account
contributions from its purchase of mobile game company Beijing
Feiliu Jiutian Technology Co., which was completed in November,
as well as the deal with  America Movil , Andy Yeung, an analyst
at Oppenheimer & Co., said by phone yesterday from New York
yesterday.  “It gives people a bit more confidence in terms of the
Feiliu acquisition,” said Yueng, who rates NQ Mobile shares the
equivalent of a buy. “In 2013 people are probably going to
focus more on the execution of what they already have on the
table, looking at margins.”  China Lodging, which runs the nation’s fourth-largest
economy hotel chain, tumbled to $16.51, the lowest price since
Jan. 3. The Shanghai-based company expects same-hotel revenue
per available room to grow as much as 3 percent this year,
trailing a 6 percent growth in 2012, according to the transcript
of the March 6 conference call.  Huaneng Downgrade  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011)  slipped 2.7 percent to
$41.44 in a second day of declines. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
downgraded China’s largest electricity producer to the
equivalent of neutral from buy, citing slowing earnings growth
as, according to a March 7 note. The company, based in Beijing,
surged 77 percent in 2012, making it the  second-best performer 
on the Bloomberg China-US gauge that year behind Qihoo 360
Technology Co. Ltd., which soared 89 percent.  ADRs of  Suntech Power Holdings Company Ltd. (STP)  rose 4.3
percent to $1.22, halting three days of declines. The Wuxi,
China-based solar manufacturer reached a settlement with GSF
Capital Pte. Ltd., an affiliated company, and Javier Romero, a
former sales agent involved in a potential fraud.  Suntech has a $541 million convertible bond maturing March
15, and the resolution of the legal dispute will “potentially
allow Suntech to sell those assets and address the debt
issues,”  Gordon Johnson , an analyst at Axiom Capital Management
Inc. based in New York, said by phone. Johnson recommends
selling the shares. “People are seeing this as a positive, but
there’s still a lot of hurdles in our view.”  Dangdang Sinks  ADRs of  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  tumbled 4.8 percent
to $3.98, the biggest drop since Dec. 21. Dangdang, as China’s
biggest online book retailer is known,  forecast  first quarter
sales of 1.3 billion  yuan  ($209 million), trailing the average
 1.5 billion yuan  projected by three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The Beijing-based company’s ADRs have posted three
consecutive months of losses.  Vipshop, an online fashion discounter based in Guangzhou,
jumped 6.8 percent to $25.19, the biggest gain since Feb. 25.
The stock had tumbled 11 percent over the  previous five days .  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 0.4 percent to
11,311.45 yesterday, while the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of
domestic Chinese shares dropped 1 percent to 2,324.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
