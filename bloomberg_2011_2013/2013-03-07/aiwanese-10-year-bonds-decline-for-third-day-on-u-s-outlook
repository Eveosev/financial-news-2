Taiwan ’s 10-year bonds fell for a
third day, the longest losing streak in a month, as more data
suggesting the  U.S. economy  is improving encouraged risk-taking
and damped demand for government debt.  Companies in the U.S., the island’s second-biggest export
market, added 198,000 workers last month, more than the 170,000
projected in a Bloomberg survey, a report showed yesterday.
Global funds bought $33 million more Taiwanese stocks than they
sold today, taking net purchases this year to $2 billion,
according to exchange data. The Ministry of Finance will release
its bond-sale plan for next quarter at the end of this month.  “Investors are getting more and more confident about the
U.S. economy,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader in Taipei
at Cathay United Bank Co. “Sentiment will probably stay risk-on
until the end of the month. Then we have to pay attention to the
bond-sale plan.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due March 2023 rose
one basis point to 1.22 percent, according to prices from Gretai
Securities Market. That was the highest level since Feb. 25.  Taiwan’s exports dropped 15.8 percent last month from a
year earlier, following a 21.8 percent increase the previous
month,  official data showed today. The decline was probably due
to seasonal factors, Credit Agricole CIB analysts led by Adam Myers in  London  wrote in a note today.  Currency Market  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.695 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.77 on March 5, the weakest level since September
2012. One-month  non-deliverable forwards  were little changed at
NT$29.625, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 11 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4
percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at
0.388 percent, according to the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
