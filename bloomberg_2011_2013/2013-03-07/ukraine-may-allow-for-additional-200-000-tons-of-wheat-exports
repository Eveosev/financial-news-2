Ukraine may export as much as 6.5
million metric tons of wheat in the year ending June 30, if it
decides this month to boost the shipment allowance by 200,000
tons, the Agriculture Ministry said.  Exports have been limited since the countryâ€™s grain harvest
dropped 29 percent to 15.8 million tons this year on drought,
according to state statistics office data.  The wheat shipment estimate for the year was raised by
300,000 tons to 6.3 million tons yesterday on favorable weather,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
