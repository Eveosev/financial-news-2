Pandora Media Inc. (P) , the Internet
radio service, rose as much as 26 percent in extended trading
after fourth-quarter results exceeded analyst' estimates,
spurred by rising advertising and subscriber revenue.  Pandora rose to $14.75 after the results. The stock gained
0.6 percent to $11.74 at the close in  New York  after Apple Inc.
delayed a competing service until later this year.  Fourth-quarter ad sales rose 51 percent to $109 million,
the company said today in a statement, while royalty payments
increased 59 percent to $77 million. Pandora is opening sales
offices in the 25 biggest cities to accelerate revenue growth in
the $14 billion local radio market and is limiting free use on
mobile devices to contain music costs.  “We continue to monetize mobile at record levels and
exceeded our expectations for the quarter,”  Joe Kennedy ,
chairman and chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Excluding items, Oakland, California-based Pandora posted a
loss of 4 cents a share in the quarter ended Jan. 31,  smaller
than the 5-cent loss seen by analysts. Revenue rose 54 percent
to $125.1 million, beating the $122.8 million average of 20
estimates.  The net loss in the fourth quarter grew to $14.6 million,
or 9 cents, from $8.18 million, or 5 cents, a year ago, Pandora
said in a  statement .  This quarter, the company forecasts sales of $120 million
to $125 million, more than the $118.6 million seen by analysts.
Excluding items, the company predicts a loss of 10 cents to 13
cents a share, compared with the 10 average estimate of
analysts.  Ratings Data  By May, Pandora will be on the radio industry’s biggest
advertising services, giving them the same access to marketers
as conventional  radio stations . The services will provide
Pandora’s audience ratings alongside to those of stations and
let buyers place ads, Kennedy said in an interview this month.  At the end of last month, Pandora had 67.7 million active
listeners, amounting to 8.5 percent of total U.S. radio, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
