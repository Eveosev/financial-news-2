Sumitomo Corp. (8053) , Japan’s fourth-
largest trading house, raised its forecast for a global aluminum
surplus to the highest level in two years as demand from China,
the biggest consumer, won’t be enough to absorb new capacity.  Supply will outpace demand for a seventh year by 866,000
metric tons this year from 760,000 tons in 2012, said Shingi Yamagiwa, manager of light metals trading at Sumitomo, which has
stakes in smelters in  Australia , Brazil,  Malaysia  and  Indonesia .  Aluminum, used in cars, packaging and houses, has declined
11 percent in the past year, driving top producers  Alcoa Inc. (AA) ,
Rio Tinto Group and  United Co. Rusal (486)  to cut output. Inventories
in the main trading regions of  China , also the largest producer,
probably climbed to a record, according to data provider SMM
Information & Technology Co. Manufacturing growth in China
unexpectedly slowed last month, a signal its economic recovery
may be losing steam.  “China alone will have a surplus of about 510,000 tons
this year after years of smelting capacity expansion,” Yamagiwa
said in an interview yesterday. China accounts for 46 percent of
global supply and 45 percent of demand, according to Sumitomo.  Global smelters’ average production cost is $2,164 a ton,
Yamagiwa said. Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange
rose 0.5 percent to $1,963 a ton at 3:29 p.m. Tokyo time. The
contract for delivery in June on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
climbed 0.4 percent to 14,940  yuan  ($2,329) a ton.  Output Cuts  About 30 percent of capacity in China is loss-making at
current prices and producers will have to cut output sooner or
later, United Co. Rusal, the largest producer, said on Feb. 25.  China Power Investment Corp., the country’s second-largest
producer by capacity, plans to eliminate as much as 300,000 tons
of obsolete aluminum capacity out of 2.7 million tons, President
Lu Qizhou said yesterday.  Rusal will cut 300,000 tons of existing capacity in 2013,
compared with 4.2 million tons produced last year, the company
said on March 4. Lower output will be maintained for three years
unless prices recover significantly, said Oleg Mukhamedshin,
director of strategy and business development.  The average aluminum price on the London Metal Exchange in
2012 was 15 percent lower than a year earlier on the global
supply glut. Global output will exceed demand by 1.82 million
tons this year from 1.49 million tons in 2012, Barclays Plc said
on Feb. 15.  Stockpiles tracked by the LME climbed to a record 5.24
million tons on Dec. 21, according to bourse data tracked by
Bloomberg. The holdings stood at 5.19 million tons yesterday.
Inventories tracked by the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose to
482,408 tons last week, the highest level since November 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
