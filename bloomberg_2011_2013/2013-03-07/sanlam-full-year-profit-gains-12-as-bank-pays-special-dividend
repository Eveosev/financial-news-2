Sanlam Ltd. (SLM) , the largest South
African-based insurer, said full-year profit rose 12 percent as
sales increased and the value of equity investments climbed.  Net income gained to 5.8 billion rand ($637 million) in
2012, from 5.2 billion rand a year earlier, the Cape Town-based
insurer said in a statement today. Sanlam boosted its dividend
27 percent to 1.65 rand and earnings per share excluding one-
time items of 2.87 rand missed the 2.95 rand median  estimate  of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. It declared a special
dividend of 50 cents a share.  “The board fully supports the stated strategy not to hold
excess capital that is unlikely to be utilised within a
reasonable period,” Sanlam said in the statement. The special
dividend will return to shareholders about 1 billion rand.  Sanlam operates in  Africa ,  Europe , the U.K., U.S., India
and  Malaysia . The insurer last year bought operations in South
Africa, expanded its investment in an Indian financial services
group and bought a 49 percent stake in Malaysia’s Pacific &
Orient Insurance Co.  In 2013, Sanlam will ’’focus on extracting more value from
existing operations in Africa, continue to identify other
expansion opportunities in South East Asia and selected markets
and strengthen distribution capabilities in South Africa,’’ it
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
