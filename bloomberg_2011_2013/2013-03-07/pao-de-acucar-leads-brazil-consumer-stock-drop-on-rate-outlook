Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar , Brazil’s biggest retailer, retreated from a
record high as consumer stocks sank after the central bank
signaled that it’s prepared to increase interest rates.  Shares dropped 3 percent to 100.61 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, snapping a six-day advance. It was the
second- worst performer  in the MSCI Brazil/Consumer Staples
Index, which fell 0.5 percent. The Bovespa index gained 1.6
percent.  Brazil’s swap rates rose the most in two weeks as traders
stepped up bets that policy makers will increase borrowing
costs. They removed language indicating that the benchmark Selic
should remain stable for a prolonged period from their statement
released yesterday after holding it at a record low 7.25 percent
for a third meeting.  “Increasing interest rates would be a disaster, and bad
for retailers,” Pedro Galdi, the chief strategist at Sao Paulo-
based brokerage SLW Corretora, said in a phone interview. “The
economy is already not growing.”  Brazil’s economy grew 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of
last year, less than the 0.8 percent median estimate of 37
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. It expanded 0.9 percent in 2012.
Inflation has exceeded the midpoint of the central bank’s target
for more than two years.  “The central bank will have to raise the Selic, there’s no
other way,” Karina Freitas, an analyst at brokerage Concordia
SA in Sao Paulo, said by phone. “That will affect consumption,
as it increases the cost of credit. It could have an impact on
Pao de Acucar’s outlook.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
