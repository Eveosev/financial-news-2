Chile’s peso rose to a two-week high
as copper, the country’s biggest export, climbed after the
 European Central Bank  said the region’s economy is improving.  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 472.08 per  U.S. dollar 
as of 11:10 a.m. in Santiago, and earlier reached 471.9 per U.S.
dollar, the strongest level since Feb. 19.  The euro gained and copper rallied after  Standard & Poor’s 
raised its outlook for  Portugal ’s credit rating, easing concern
about the euro-area debt crisis, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said its bullish on the metal. European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said economic activity will recover in 2013.  “The euro is rising and copper is rebounding a bit from
yesterday,” said Eugenio Cortes, the head of currency forwards
at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “We’re in a
lateral range and without a structural or fundamental change
it’s hard for the peso to break the range.”  The peso has traded in a range of 469.1 to 476.3 per dollar
for the past 45 trading sessions. Thirty-day volatility in the
peso held close to a 15-year low and volatility over 90 days
fell to the lowest since 2007.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
increased their net bets against the currency to $3.1 billion on
March 5, the highest since Jan. 10, according to data published
today by the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
