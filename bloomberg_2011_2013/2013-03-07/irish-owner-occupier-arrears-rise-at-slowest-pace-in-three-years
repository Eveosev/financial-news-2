Irish private residential arrears
rose in the fourth quarter at the slowest pace in at least three
years, adding to evidence that the worst may be over for the
economy.  Some 11.9 percent of the nation’s 792,096 owner-occupier
loans were at least three months behind in payments at the end
of December, compared with 11.5 percent in September, the
Dublin-based central bank said in a  statement  today. The number
of restructured loans fell to 79,852 cases from 81,634. Those
whose terms have been eased permanently rose 13 percent to
23,432 during the quarter, the bank said.  “While, at first glance, the overall stock of restructured
mortgages has fallen, we note that this masks a double-digit
increase in the number of permanent restructures, which are a
more sustainable way of addressing troubled loans,” said Philip O’Sullivan, chief economist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin.  Prime Minister Enda Kenny said yesterday he’s seeking “to
accelerate a solution” to the nation’s mortgage crisis. By
value, about 25 percent of all residential loans including buy-
to-let were at least three months in arrears or had been
restructured at the end of December, little changed from the
third quarter, according to Bloomberg News calculations.  Banks are turning to more permanent solutions for loans,
including term extensions, permanent interest-rate reductions
and split mortgages, where some of the loan is hived off until a
borrower’s circumstances improve. About 30 percent of modified
loans are now permanently restructured, the central bank said.  The most popular form of forbearance is allowing borrowers
to only pay interest, at 37 percent of restructured loans, it
said. Extending the terms of loans account for 17 percent, and
split mortgages 0.01 percent at the end of December. The central
bank started publishing arrears figures in 2009.  Buy-to-Let  Buy-to-let arrears rose to 18.9 percent of such loans from
17.9 percent at the end of September. The number of restructured
investment loans fell to 21,800 to 22,182 on the quarter.  The number of buy-to-let properties in banks’ possession
rose to 454 at the end of December from 408 at the beginning of
the quarter. Lenders repossessed 88 such units in the quarter,
while selling 42.  “Repossessions are at an unnaturally low level,” John Moran, head of the finance ministry, told lawmakers at a
parliamentary committee meeting in Dublin today.  Repossessed owner-occupier homes fell to 903 from 947
during the final three months of the year. A total of 134 homes
were seized by lenders during the quarter, of which 96 were
voluntarily surrendered or abandoned. During the quarter, 178
such properties were sold.  Dublin home prices, which have fallen 54 percent from their
2007 peak, rose 2.1 percent in January from the year earlier
period. Unemployment has been unchanged at 14.1 percent for the
last three months, after tripling to 15 percent in the four
years through January 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
