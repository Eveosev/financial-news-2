Mail carrier Bpost SA of  Belgium 
plans to pay back about 85 million euros ($110 million) in aid
from the Belgian government,  L’Echo  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The estimated amount of illegal state support received in
2011 and 2012 is included in a package of proposals to European
Union competition authorities that also foresees a new three-
year distribution contract for the company, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
