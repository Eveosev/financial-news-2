Ethanol outpaced gasoline as plant
shutdowns led to the longest streak of weekly supply declines
since October 2010.  The spread narrowed 3.74 cents to 68.73 cents a gallon a
day after the Energy Information Administration said ethanol
 inventories  fell for a fifth week to a 13-week low and  output 
slipped for the first time since Jan. 25.  “We’ve taken some production offline,” said Chris Manns,
an analyst and co-founder of Chicago Traders Group. “Margins
are there right now.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery rose 3.6 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.436 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 11 percent this year.  Gasoline futures for April delivery fell 0.14 cent to
$3.1233 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  As many as 20 plants have been idled since June after
drought in the Midwest scorched corn crops and raised
manufacturing costs for ethanol producers, according to the
 Renewable Fuels Association  in  Washington .  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest U.S. ethanol
producer, said Feb. 13 that it resumed output at an Albion,
Nebraska, plant because it had become profitable to make the
biofuel.  Paying Bills  “Some plants are making money right now,” Manns said.
“Nobody’s popping champagne or anything, but they’re paying the
light bill. That’s what they want to do until the new crop of
corn comes in.”  Corn for March delivery added 3.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$7.115 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. The May contract gained 2.75 cents to
$6.9175 a bushel.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
11 cents a gallon, up from minus 12.4 cents yesterday. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Stockpiles fell to 19.4 million barrels a day last week,
about 12 percent lower than a year ago, and production fell to
805,000 barrels a day, or 11 percent lower than last year, the
EIA reported yesterday.  Gasoline Pool  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, the highest level since Oct. 5,
EIA data show. The EIA is the statistical arm of the Energy
Department.  U.S. producers didn’t have to contend with Brazilian
 imports  of the fuel last week. The country didn’t import any of
the fuel for the first time since Feb. 1.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.42 a gallon last week,
about even with today’s futures price, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Concern that domestic ethanol supply and motor fuel
consumption are falling has led to an increase in the worth of
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, used to track whether
refiners are meeting U.S. biofuel-use mandates.  Corn-ethanol based RINs  rose to a record 77 cents yesterday
from 76 cents on March 5 and up from the 2013 low of 7.1 cents
on Jan. 7, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  RINs Values  Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and Brazilian-made
ethanol, fell to 79 cents from a record 81 cents the previous
day. The difference in value between the two is the slimmest
this year. Advanced RINs were more than five times as costly as
the conventional sort on Jan. 7.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  fell 2 cents to
$2.52, dropped 2 cents to $2.41 in Chicago and slipped the same
amount in the U.S. Gulf to $2.465, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. On the West Coast, the additive gained 0.5 cent to
$2.625.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf rose to 16 cents
from 13.5 cents yesterday, while Chicago’s discount to New York
Harbor was unchanged at 11 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
