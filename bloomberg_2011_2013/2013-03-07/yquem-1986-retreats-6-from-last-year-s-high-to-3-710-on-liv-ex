A case of Chateau d’Yquem 1986
Sauternes traded at 2,466 pounds ($3,710) on the London-based
Liv-ex wine market this week, 6 percent below last year’s high
of 2,630 pounds reached 10 months ago, according to data on
the exchange’s Cellar Watch website.  The wine, the highest-classified of the dessert wines from
Bordeaux, fetched as much as $5,819 in April last year for a
case sold at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in New York, according to the auction
house’s online records. The vintage is among Yquem’s eight
highest-priced of the past quarter-century, Liv-ex data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
