(Corrects unit sales price in 5th paragraph with comment
from the company.)  Ulker Biskuvi Sanayi AS (ULKER)  dropped the
most in more than three weeks after  Turkey ’s largest candy maker
reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Ulker  fell  as much as 2.4 percent to 12 liras before
trimming losses to 12.15 liras at the close in Istanbul
yesterday, the biggest drop since Feb. 11. About 595,000 shares
were traded, or 1.4 times the stock’s three-month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Istanbul Stock
Exchange National 100 (XU100)  index slid 0.4 percent.  Net income plunged 75 percent to 167 million liras ($93
million) in 2012, Istanbul-based Ulker said in a regulatory
filing after the market closed yesterday. The figure missed the
180.5 million-lira average  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Fourth-quarter profit, at 26 million liras, also
lagged market estimates, according to Melda Agirdas, an analyst
at Ekspres Invest in Istanbul.  “Demand slowdown -- weak sales growth in the high season -
- could be troubling in 2013,” Agirdas said in a report
yesterday. She maintained her “market underperform”
recommendation for the shares, with a 12-month price target of
9.6 liras.  The average unit sales price decreased by 0.6 percent in
2012 over 2011 due to lower pricing on exports as the dollar
weakened, Ozgur Kalyoncu, investor relations manager at Yildiz
Holding, parent company of Ulker, said by e-mail today. The
average sales price contracted 7 percent in the fourth quarter
over the same quarter of 2011, he said.  The company will continue a trend of “sustainable and
profitable growth,” Chief Executive Officer Mehmet Tutuncu said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Ulker traded at 25 times earnings at the close yesterday,
compared with 14.2 times for Saudi Arabia’s  Savola (SAVOLA) , and 20.4
times for  Israel ’s  Osem Investments Ltd. (OSEM) , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Four analysts recommend investors buy the
shares, nine say to hold them and two advise selling, according
to data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
