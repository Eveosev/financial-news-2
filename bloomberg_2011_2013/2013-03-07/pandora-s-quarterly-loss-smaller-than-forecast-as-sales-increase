Pandora Media Inc. (P) , the Internet
radio service, posted a fourth-quarter loss that was smaller
than analysts predicted as sales exceeded forecasts. The shares
soared 18 percent in extended trading.  Excluding items, the loss was 4 cents a share, smaller than
the 5-cent loss seen by analysts, the average of 20  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. The net loss grew to $14.6 million, or 9
cents, from $8.18 million, or 5 cents, a year ago, Oakland,
California-based Pandora said today in a  statement .  Pandora rose 18 percent to $13.81 after the results were
announced. The stock gained 0.6 percent to $11.74 at the close
in  New York  after Apple Inc. delayed the start of a competing
service until later this year. It has gained 28 percent in 2013.  Pandora is limiting users of mobile devices to 40 hours of
free listening a month to contain music costs and is backing
U.S. legislation to lower royalty payments. The company said
fourth-quarter ad sales rose 51 percent to $109 million, while
royalty payments ballooned 59 percent to $77 million. Pandora is
opening sales offices in the 25 biggest radio markets to
accelerate ad-revenue growth.  Revenue in the quarter ended Jan. 31 climbed 54 percent to
$125.1 million, exceeding the $122.8 million average of
analysts’ estimates.  By May, Pandora will be competing directly with
conventional stations for the first time on the radio industry’s
biggest advertising services, gaining better access to the $14
billion market.  The services will provide Pandora’s audience ratings
alongside to those of stations and let buyers place ads, Chief
Executive Officer  Joe Kennedy  said in an interview this month.  At the end of last month, Pandora had 67.7 million active
listeners, amounting to 8.5 percent of total U.S. radio, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
