Israel ’s benchmark government bonds
fell, lifting the yield up the most in more than three weeks, as
a decline in government tax receipts increased bets the country
may struggle to meet its budget deficit target.  The yield on the 4.25 percent securities maturing March
2023 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, the
biggest increase since Feb. 13, to 3.93 percent at 12:02 p.m. in
Tel Aviv. The yield on the 5.5 percent notes due Jan. 2022
gained two basis points to 3.70 percent.  Israel posted a 4.3 billion-shekel ($1.15 billion) budget
deficit in February in part due to “unusually large” tax
refunds, the Finance Ministry said today, after a surplus of 2.6
billion shekels in January. Receipts declined 4.8 percent in
real terms from last February as slowing global growth moderated
the expansion of the export-dependent economy. The government is
targeting a deficit equivalent to 3 percent of economic output.  “The deficit in February is mainly due a decline in tax
income as tax refunds were much higher than expected and also as
expenditure rose,” said Modi Shafrir, chief economist at Tel
Aviv-based I.L.S. Brokers, said by phone. “As a result it will
be very difficult for the government to meet its budget deficit
target for 2013 without raising taxes.”  Budget Deficit  The government refunded 2.2 billion shekels last month
compared with 0.7 billion shekels last February, the ministry
said. This year’s budget deficit may be 3.6 percent of gross
domestic product, according to central bank projections.  Israel must cut 14 billion shekels from its budget, Finance
Minister Yuval Steinitz said in January. The deficit last year
reached 4.2 percent of GDP. Economic growth slowed to 3.3
percent last year from 4.6 percent in 2011, prompting the
central bank to cut interest rates.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, advanced one basis
points to 1.61 percent. The shekel strengthened 0.2 percent to
3.7278 a dollar, trimming its retreat this month to 0.4 percent.
