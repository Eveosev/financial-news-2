Greentech Energy Systems A/S (GES) , a
Danish renewable-energy developer, agreed to invest in U.S.
solar plants with Britain’s Foresight Group LLP to expand
outside Europe.  The companies will invest in an initial 100 megawatts of
solar projects, both operational and under development,
Copenhagen-based Greentech said today in a  statement . The
partners will set up a joint venture for their collaboration, to
be held 51 percent by Greentech and the rest by Foresight.  Greentech is seeking to add business outside Europe, where
nations including Spain, Germany and  Italy  have pared support
for solar power to stem unsustainable growth. By targeting the
U.S., it can benefit from state-level incentives that may drive
at least 3.9 gigawatts of solar installations this year, up from
3.2 gigawatts in 2012, Bloomberg New Energy Finance data show.  “By entering the U.S., which is one of the world’s most
important and attractive renewable-energy markets, Greentech
will diversify out of  Europe ,” Chairman Peter Hostgaard-Jensen
said in the statement. Foresight, based in Sevenoaks, southern
 England , manages about 700 million pounds ($1.05 billion) raised
from institutional investors, individuals and pension funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
