Yields on  Mexico ’s shorter-term
bonds fell as speculation mounted that policy makers will reduce
benchmark borrowing costs as soon as tomorrow after holding them
at 4.5 percent since July 2009.  Yields on peso-denominated debt due in December 2013
dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.18
percent at 8:30 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Mexico’s currency was little changed at 12.7814
per U.S. dollar.  The yields on interbank futures contracts due in March
dropped 0.35 percentage point since before the last rate
decision in January to 4.51 percent through yesterday, showing
investors have been boosting bets for a rate cut to be announced
tomorrow, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s part of what we’ve seen in recent weeks with the
outlook that the Bank of Mexico could cut rates,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB
who is forecasting a 50 basis point reduction tomorrow, said in
a phone interview from Mexico City. “It’s the outlook that if
the Banco de Mexico cuts the reference rate for the market,
there’s an expectation for what will happen to bonds across the
curve.”  Inflation accelerated to 3.55 percent last month, the
national statistics agency reported today. Cost-of-living
increases slowed for four straight months through January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
