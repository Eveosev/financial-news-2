Germany ’s  chemical industry  was
“surprisingly strong” in January and February as industrial
customers started restocking inventories, Utz Tillmann, head of
the VCI German chemical association, said.  While the beginning of March has been “somewhat more
cautious,” it looks as if the first quarter will be better than
the three months through December, Tillmann said yesterday at a
press conference in Frankfurt, where the organization is based.  BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s biggest chemical maker, said last
month it expects earnings and sales to rise this year. Customers
started ordering again in January after letting inventories
shrink at the end of last year, Chief Executive Officer Kurt
Bock said. VCI, which represents 1,650 chemical companies
including BASF and  Lanxess AG (LXS) , reiterated a full-year forecast
for chemical sales to gain 2 percent.  “Industrial customers at home have ordered more chemicals
in the past months,” the VCI said in its quarterly report. “In
the absence of new setbacks, this trend will probably continue
for the rest of 2013. Even neighboring European countries are
showing a moderate upward trend.”  Chemical production will probably increase 1.5 percent with
selling prices rising 0.5 percent, leading to the gain of 2
percent in sales to 190 billion euros ($247 billion), VCI
reiterated.  Fourth-quarter sales in the chemical industry rose 3.8
percent compared with a year earlier, VCI said. The industry
employed 437,000 people at the end of the quarter, 2 percent
more than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
