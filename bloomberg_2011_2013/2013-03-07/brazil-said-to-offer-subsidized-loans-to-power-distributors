Brazil  plans to offer subsidized
loans for electricity distributors whose cash flow has been
reduced by price cuts and higher costs, said two people with
knowledge of the measure.  The National Treasury will tap the so-called CDE industry
development account to provide cheap funding for distributors,
said the people, who asked not to be named because the plan
hasn’t been made public. Energy Ministry press department
officials didn’t respond to e-mailed and telephone requests for
comment on the plan.  Energy Minister Edison Lobao told reporters Feb. 27 that
the National Treasury planned to give companies financial
assistance after the government lowered prices to contain
inflation. Reservoir levels at a decade low are curtailing the
use of cheap hydro power and forcing Brazil to fire up costly
thermal plants to avert an energy shortfall.  Brazilian electricity distributors have lost 5 billion
reais ($2.55 billion) since October after power prices surged,
wiping out gains anticipated from a government initiative to cut
energy expenses, according to an estimate from the Distributors
Association, known as Abradee.  To contact the reporters on this story:
