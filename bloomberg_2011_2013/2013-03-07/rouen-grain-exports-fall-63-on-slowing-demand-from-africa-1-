Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, slid 63 percent
in the latest week as demand from  Africa  slowed.  Shipments fell to 91,272 metric tons in the week ended
yesterday from 247,213 tons in the prior period, the  Seine River
port  wrote in an e-mailed report today. Wheat cargoes tumbled 58
percent to 88,252 tons.  Morocco was the top destination, buying 59,802 tons of
wheat. That was half of the total a week earlier, when the
country’s purchases were the highest since December 2011.
Algeria also bought half as much wheat as a week earlier, while
no grain was sold to  Senegal  or  Ivory Coast , which both made
purchases in the previous week.  The Netherlands was the only buyer of barley, purchasing
3,020 tons of malting-grade grain, according to the report.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of France’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, exceeding the 17 percent share for La Pallice on
the Bay of Biscay and Dunkirk on the  North Sea  with 11 percent
of the total, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
