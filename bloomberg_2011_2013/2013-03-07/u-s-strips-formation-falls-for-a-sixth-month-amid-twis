The outstanding amount of zero-
coupon U.S. Treasury notes and bonds rose in February by the
most in more than two years as investors bet inflation will stay
low even as the  Federal Reserve  continues monetary stimulus.  Strips, short for separate trading of registered interest
and principal securities, are created by Wall Street firms that
split bonds into their face amount and individual coupon
payments. The amount of strips, also known as zero-coupon debt,
rose by $6.7 billion, the biggest climb on a monthly basis since
September 2010, according to the data. It rose to $201 billion
at the end of last month, the  most  since August 2011, Treasury
Department data showed yesterday.  “People are doubling down on the possibility that
inflation is not going to rise as quickly,” said  George Goncalves , head of interest-rate strategy at Nomura Holdings
Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that trade Treasuries with the
Fed. “If you feel comfortable that inflation has reached a
near-term high and if the Fed’s credibility remain intact,
buying these long-term strips would be one way of doing it.”  Strips reached $207.5 billion in July 2011, the highest
level in more than 10 years.  Thirty-year strips have lost 4.9 percent this year after
returning 2.1 percent in 2012, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index shows. The broader U.S. Treasury market lost 0.4 percent
this year, after returning 2.2 percent in 2012.  Eligible Securities  An estimated $9.559 trillion of  Treasury securities  were
eligible for stripping last month, while $9.358 trillion were
held in unstripped form, Treasury data showed. In addition,
$16.583 billion of formerly stripped Treasury securities were
reconstituted.  U.S. consumer prices rose 1.6 percent in January from a
year earlier, the Labor Department reported Feb. 21. Inflation
averaged 2.5 percent over the past decade.  Fed policy makers reiterated in January the central bank
will keep its benchmark  interest-rate  target at almost zero as
long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and inflation
is projected to be no more than 2.5 percent. It said it intends
to keep buying bonds until there is a “substantial improvement”
in the labor market. The  unemployment rate  is 7.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
