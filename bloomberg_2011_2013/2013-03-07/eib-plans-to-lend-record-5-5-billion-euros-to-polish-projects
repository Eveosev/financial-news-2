The European Investment Bank  plans
to grant a record 5.5 billion euros ($7.2 billion) of loans in
Poland this year as the European Union’s biggest eastern state
upgrades roads, power plants and waste management facilities.  The Luxembourg-based bank awarded 4.4 billion euros of
credits in 2012, helping finance the upgrade of a highway from
the capital Warsaw to Wroclaw and the modernization of power
distribution networks for  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  and  Enea SA (ENA) ,
the EU’s lending arm said in a presentation today. The bank’s
level of funding next year will remain “similar” to 2013, EIB
Vice President Anton Rop said at a news conference in Warsaw.  Lending to energy projects, which accounted for 13 percent
of the EIB’s financing in 2012, will almost double to about 1
billion euros this year, Rop said.  The EIB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the World Bank said in November they plan to
support eastern  Europe  with 30 billion euros in the next two
years to shield it from the euro area’s debt crisis. Poland’s
economic growth will slow this year to 1.2 percent, the weakest
pace since 2001, according to the European Commission.  Tauron,  Poland ’s second-biggest power utility, said last
month that its plan to sell 1.5 billion zloty ($471 million) of
bonds this year will depend on the possibility of getting funds
from other sources, including state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa
Krajowego, government fund Polskie Inwestycje Rozwojowe SA and
the EIB.  Poland accounted for half of the loans the bank granted in
2012 to the 12 new EU member states, the EIB said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
