Indian stock-index futures dropped,
signaling benchmark indexes may decline for the first time in
three days.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for March delivery fell 0.3
percent to 5,828 at 10:16 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of  India  Ltd. rose
0.6 percent to 5,818.60 yesterday, its highest close since Feb.
25. The S&P BSE Sensex index added 0.6 percent to 19,252.61. The
Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares
increased 0.6 percent to a one-week high.  The Sensex has dropped 4.2 percent from a two-year high on
Jan. 25 as net incomes at companies from  Tata Motors (TTMT)  to  State
Bank of India  missed  estimates  for the December quarter and the
economy expanded at the slowest pace in almost four years.  “The case for a structural bull run doesn’t seem to be
very strong,” Nikhil Vora, the Mumbai-based managing director
at IDFC Securities Ltd., said in an interview with Bloomberg TV
India yesterday. “I’m now turning a bit more skeptical on the
near-term deliverance from  Indian (SENSEX)  markets.”  Weak economic data may prompt the  Reserve Bank  of India to
cut borrowing costs at its March 19 policy review, Abhay Laijawala, head of research at Deutsche Equities India Pvt.,
said in Mumbai on March 4. The RBI pared the repurchase  rate  by
25 basis points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29, the first reduction
in nine months.  Overseas funds bought a net $55.6 million of Indian stocks
on March 5, extending purchases this year to a net $8.48
billion, a record for the period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “India’s dependence on foreign flows is very high and that
is a risk for the markets,” Madhusudan Kela, chief investment
strategist at Reliance Capital Ltd., said in an interview with
Bloomberg TV India yesterday. “I don’t see the market making a
new high in a hurry.”  The measure trades at 13.6 times  projected 12-month
profits , compared with 14.3 times on Jan. 25, compared with the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.3 times, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
