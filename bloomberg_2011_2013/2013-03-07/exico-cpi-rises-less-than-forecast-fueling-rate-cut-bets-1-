  Mexico â€™s consumer prices rose less
than analysts forecast in February, supporting expectations that
the central bank may cut the benchmark  interest rate  as soon as
tomorrow.  Prices climbed 0.49 percent in the month, the national
statistics institute said today, lifting annual inflation to
3.55 percent from 3.25 percent in January. The median estimate
of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for prices to rise 0.53
percent.  Core inflation , which excludes energy and agriculture
prices, gained 0.51 percent, compared with the 0.54 percent
forecast by analysts.  Annual inflation quickened after touching a 15-month low in
January that caused traders to bet the central bank would cut
the overnight rate for the first time since July 2009. Twenty
one of 22 economists in a Citigroup Inc. Banamex survey expect
policy makers to reduce borrowing costs this year, with eight
forecasting the move will happen tomorrow, after the central
bank said it may cut the 4.5 percent rate if inflation keeps
falling toward its 3 percent target.  Yields on fixed-rate Mexican  government bonds  due in
December 2013 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 4.21 percent at 8:06 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on inflation-linked bonds maturing
in 2014 were little changed at 0.98 percent. The peso was little
changed at 12.7786 per dollar. The peso rose 8.4 percent last
year, the most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
