Lithuania, which seeks to adopt the
euro in 2015, can join the currency union without holding a
nationwide referendum, Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said,
contradicting a coalition partner.  “There are no fears and there is no need to organize any
referendum,” Butkevicius said today on Ziniu radio in Vilnius,
the capital. “We already committed to adopting the euro when we
joined the EU in 2004, in our accession treaty.”  The stance is disputed by some members of the four-party
government that took office in December, according to Rolandas
Paksas, head of the coalition party Order & Justice. Given
concerns about the common currency’s future in many European
Union countries, “Parliament should take the initiative to call
a referendum on adopting the euro,” Paksas said March 2 in an
 article  on the news portal delfi.lt.  Among Lithuanians, 57 percent had either a very or somewhat
negative attitude to euro adoption in January, compared with 32
percent of respondents who were positive and 11 percent without
an opinion, pollster Baltijos Tyrimai said on Jan. 31. The
survey of about 1,000 people for ELTA news service gave no
margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
