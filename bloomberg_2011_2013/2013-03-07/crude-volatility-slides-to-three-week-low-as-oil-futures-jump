Crude options volatility slid to the
lowest level since Feb. 13 as underlying futures rose the most
since Feb. 11.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 17.52 percent at 4 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , down from 19.81 yesterday.  “People aren’t as worried about a disruption in supply for
oil because supplies are rising, and there’s expectation demand
isn’t going to be so strong in the short term because we’re in
the shoulder season between winter and summer,” said  Phil
Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery rose
$1.13, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $91.56 a barrel on the
Nymex. Prices have declined 7.7 percent from a year-to-date high
of $97.94 on Jan. 30.  U.S. crude supplies climbed  3.83 million barrels  to 381.4
million last week, the highest level since June, according to

March 16, 2012.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
