Following are market-outlook
comments from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest shipbroker, on
different parts of shipping.  It commented in a financial report today.  Dry-Bulk:  “The market will continue to struggle with the impact of
oversupply. However, planned increasing in cargo volumes and
continued growth in demand is fundamental to our long-term
belief in this sector.”  Container Shipping:  “Throughout the year there was an increasing focus on the
fuel efficiency of new designs compared to existing designs and
with the order book now down to the lowest levels since 2004 and
new contracting even down to 2002 levels, there is beginning to
be an increased appetite to secure positions for these modern
vessels, with the main challenge being finance.”  Gas:  “2013 poses challenges for the gas markets as additional
vessels enter the fleet, at first outpacing the expected growth
in trade. This threatens to keep rates under pressure until the
expansion in export capacity from U.S. terminals starts to
provide a stimulus later in the year. Focus in 2013 will be on
reinforcing our existing areas of activity and capturing
 emerging markets  in  Asia  and the U.S. which herald change and
growth opportunities in the next few years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
