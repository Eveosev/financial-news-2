India ’s rupee rose, erasing earlier
losses, on speculation the yield advantage on local assets will
attract global capital as advanced nations keep interest rates
low to revive economic growth.  The  European Central Bank  will keep its benchmark rate at a
record low today, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Euro-based
investors will earn 10.9 percent including interest, the most in
Asia, by holding rupees until the end of this year, based on
currency forecasts and deposit rates compiled by Bloomberg. Ten-
year government bonds pay 7.86 percent in India, compared with
1.92 percent in the U.S. and 1.44 percent in Germany.  “With potentially sticky exchange rates, the best way to
make money could be to focus on the carry,” analysts at Credit
Agricole CIB, including Paris-based Sebastien Barbe, wrote in a
report today, referring to the practice of borrowing in a low-
yield currency to invest in one with a higher  interest rate .
“We maintain our view that the rupee will be the best
performing Asian currency this year.”  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 54.5650 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It fell as much
as 0.4 percent earlier. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 35 basis points, or 0.35 percentage point, to 9.31
percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.66 per
dollar, compared with 55.86 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.57 versus 55.86. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
