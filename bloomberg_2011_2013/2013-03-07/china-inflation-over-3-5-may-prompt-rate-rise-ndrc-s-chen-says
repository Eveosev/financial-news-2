China  may need to raise  interest
rates  should gains in the consumer-price index stay at more than
3.5 percent for three months, a senior researcher affiliated
with the country’s top planning agency said.  “In theory, if CPI remains above 3.5 percent for three
months, there should be an interest-rate movement,”  Chen Dongqi , the deputy head of the National Development and Reform
Commission’s macroeconomic research institute, said in an
interview yesterday after a speech at  Tsinghua University  in
Beijing. “But it also can be decided by authorities’ own
judgment.”  Speculation that China will raise interest rates for the
first time since mid-2011 is rising as the world’s second-
largest economy recovers from the weakest growth in 13 years,
credit expands and property prices rebound. Premier  Wen Jiabao 
this week set a 3.5 percent inflation goal for 2013, down from 4
percent last year, after price gains slowed to half the pace of
2011.  “The timing of China’s interest-rate increase will depend
on the CPI situation,” Chen said. “It could happen late this
year or early next year or even later.”  Consumer inflation  may have accelerated to 3 percent last
month, according to the median analyst forecast before data due
on March 9. It was 2 percent in January and 2.6 percent for all
of 2012. The median forecast of 40 economists is for a 3.1
percent rise in 2013.  Policy Aim  An acceleration in inflation in the second half and
excessive investment from local governments after this month’s
annual meeting of the national legislature are the two biggest
risks to  China’s economy , Chen said.  Chen said separately in his speech at the Chinese
Economists 50 Forum that while the government’s inflation goal
is 3.5 percent, the real policy aim should be 3 percent. “If we
allow the CPI to reach 3.5 percent or even higher in the late
months of this year, it will reduce room for next year’s
inflation control,” Chen said.  There are some “structural bubbles” in China’s property
market and two ways to deal with the situation, Chen said. “One
is to gradually release the steam and the other is to put on a
sudden brake.”  Any excessive or hurried tightening may result in “big
swings” in economic growth as the  property market  affects about
30 other industries, he said in the speech.  The country’s new leadership faces the challenge of
sustaining a recovery without triggering consumer and asset-
price inflation. Wen, who this week set a target of 7.5 percent
for growth this year, warned that “unbalanced, uncoordinated
and unsustainable development remains a prominent problem.”  The customs administration will today report  trade  data for
February. Exports probably grew 8.1 percent, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey, down from a 25
percent pace in January.  Data in the first two months of the year are distorted by
the timing of the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in
February this year and in January in 2012.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
