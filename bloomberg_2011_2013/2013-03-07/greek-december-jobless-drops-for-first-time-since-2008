Greece ’s seasonally adjusted
 unemployment rate  fell for the first time in almost five years
in December, indicating a possible stabilization may be near
after it increased more than threefold in that time.  The jobless rate dropped to 26.4 percent from a revised
26.6 percent in November, according to an e-mailed statement
from the Athens-based Hellenic Statistical Authority today. The
last time the rate decreased was in May 2008, when it fell half
a percentage point to 7.3 percent.  Greece is in the sixth year of a recession that has been
amplified by austerity measures linked to bailouts from the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund . Gross domestic
product contracted 6.4 percent in 2012 and the European
Commission forecasts it will shrink 4.4 percent this year.  “The pressures will still be strong in the coming months
as on a quarterly basis GDP will continue to contract at a
relatively fast pace,”  Nicholas Magginas , an economist at
 National Bank of Greece SA  in  Athens , said by phone. “There’ll
be more solid evidence of whether there has been a stabilization
of the rate in the second and third quarter.”  The rate for Greeks aged 15 to 24 was 57.5 percent, while
the total female unemployment rate was 29.3 percent. The region
with the highest unemployment rate was Attica, which includes
the capital Athens, with 28.4 percent joblessness.  The statistics agency started releasing the unemployment
rate on a seasonally adjusted basis from January’s 2012 data.
