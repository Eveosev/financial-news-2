Societe Generale SA (GLE) , France’s
second-largest bank by market value, is cooperating with U.S.
authorities looking into dollar transfers for clients in
countries targeted by American economic sanctions.  “ Societe Generale  has started discussions with the Office
of Foreign Assets Control,” the Paris-based bank said in its
 annual report  today, without naming the clients or countries
involved. The bank said it has begun an internal audit.  Global regulators last month called on banks to strengthen
risk management and reinforce oversight in response to recent
scandals that have shaken faith in the financial system. A study
on lenders by the Financial Stability Board on Feb. 12 found
that “significant gaps” persist in risk management.  Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., UBS AG and Barclays
Plc have been hit by scandals ranging from rogue traders to
interest-rate fixing. U.K.-based HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard
Chartered Plc both paid fines in the U.S. over failures to halt
the laundering of money in sanctioned countries such as  Iran .  To contact the reporter on this story:
