Copper prices will come under
“downward pressure” this year as supply growth starts to come
through and demand slows, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd.  Ore grades are expected to return “to normal” at some
larger mines next year and in 2015, Steven Lewis, senior copper
analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said today at Metal Bulletin’s  26th
International Copper Conference  in  Madrid .  Higher prices for the metal used in pipes and wiring are
inflating production costs by fueling local-currency values,
according to Wood Mackenzie.  Capital spending  increased to 40
percent of total costs in 2012 from about 20 percent in 2004,
estimates by the researcher and consultant show.  Squeezed margins might limit funds to develop new mines,
particularly for some smaller projects, according to Lewis.
Still, risks of increased royalties and taxes seemingly aren’t
deterring new projects in Peru and  Zambia , he said.  Peru is the world’s third-biggest copper-producing nation
and Zambia ranks first in  Africa . The metal for delivery in
three months fell 2.7 percent this year on the London Metal
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
