Grindrod Ltd. (GND) ,  Africa ’s largest
shipping company, rose to its highest level in more than four
years as investors bet on earnings growth driven by
diversification into ports and terminals.  The  stock  advanced for the ninth time in 10 days, gaining
as much as 3.4 percent to 19.41 rand in Johannesburg, its
highest level on an intraday basis since September 2008. The
shares have gained 22 percent this year, compared with an 11
percent rise in the four-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Transport Index. (JTRNS) 
The company has a market capitalization of 11.6 billion rand
($1.27 billion).  “Investors are probably betting that the operating changes
over recent years and their investment in non-shipping
infrastructure which includes, ports, terminals and rail
concessions will generate higher returns in the future,” Paul Trilivas, an analyst at Value-Kwik, a Johannesburg-based equity
research company, said in a phone interview.  Grindrod’s relative strength index is above 70 for a third
straight day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A reading
above 70 means the stock is overbought, according to technical
analysts who follow price charts.  The company reported a 22 percent increase in full-year
earnings per share excluding one-time items to 1.22 rand on Feb.
27. The final dividend was increased 28 percent to 15.4 cents a
share, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
