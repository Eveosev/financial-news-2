Alberta expects to post a sixth
consecutive annual deficit as  Canada ’s wealthiest province seeks
to pay for new schools, roads and hospitals amid dwindling
revenue from  oil sands  and natural gas production.  The province, Canada’s fourth-most populous, will post an
operational shortfall of C$1.97 billion ($1.91 billion) in the
year that begins April 1, Finance Minister Doug Horner said
today. That compares with an estimated deficit of C$3.9 billion
in the year ending March 31.  Horner is reducing his forecasts for resource revenue this
fiscal year and next by C$10.2 billion, or 12 percent of total
revenue over two years. A 22 percent  drop  over the past six
months for the price of Western Canada Select, Canadian crude
that averaged $71.80 in 2012, has widened  the gap  relative to
world oil prices and forced the government to find ways to make
up for the shortfall.  “It’s no secret: we have our challenges,” Horner said in
the prepared text of his speech. “Immediate, serious challenges
that the budget speaks to.”  Alberta  relies on royalties and taxation of the oil and
natural gas industry for almost one-third of its revenue.  The fiscal plan is based on projections of 2.9 percent
economic growth in 2013-14, and a forecast average of C$68.21
per barrel for the benchmark Western Canada Select, a blend of
heavy oil produced from bitumen. WCS traded at $67.72 a barrel
at 2:46 p.m.  Capital Spending  Alberta will borrow C$3.19 billion in 2013-14, and bring
forward C$1.07 billion borrowed in 2012-13 to help pay for
C$5.21 billion in  capital spending , including 50 new schools,
widening the highway to Fort McMurray, the oil sands boom town,
and new health care facilities.  Premier Alison Redford promised in last year’s election
more spending on education and health care, which is now at risk
as government revenue from oil royalties plummets. The province
needs to reduce its dependency on royalties from non-renewable
resources like oil by lowering spending on health care and
implementing a  sales tax ,  Ron Kneebone , a University of Calgary
economics professor, said in a March 4 interview.  Boom, Crash  “Energy booms are always followed by energy crashes,”
said Kneebone, who has researched 20 years of Alberta budgets.
“The government needs to say we’re going to wean ourselves off
royalty revenue. Governments don’t usually do this until a
crisis hits and then has to do something drastic.”  Redford’s Progressive Conservatives, which have held power
since 1973, promised not to implement a sales tax in Alberta,
the only Canadian province without one.  Investments worth about C$23 billion this year by companies
such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Calgary’s  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and
rivals are contributing to a growing economy and population
forecast to reach 5 million in the coming two decades from 3.7
million now. The  finance ministry  expects the population to grow
by 100,000 this year.  The western province has C$16.6 billion in outstanding
bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with about C$2.7
billion of that due in 2013. Alberta’s debt is rated AAA, the
highest level, with a stable outlook by  Standard & Poor’s .  Former Premier Ralph Klein eliminated Alberta’s deficit and
debt in the 1990s. Subsequent governments have ramped up
spending to keep pace with a growing economy and population.
Health-care spending, the biggest expense for the Alberta
government, needs to be tackled or else the province may return
to the deficits of the 1980s when spending exceeded revenue by
as much as C$6,000 per capita, Kneebone said.  Redford’s Progressive Conservative party on April 24 won a
surprise re-election and renewing its majority mandate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
