Rubber climbed to a one-week high as
a better-than-estimated jump in U.S. jobs boosted the dollar
against  Japan ’s currency, raising the appeal of contracts in yen.  The contract for delivery in August advanced as much as 1.4
percent to 293 yen a kilogram ($3,116 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, the highest level since Feb. 28. The most-
active contract traded at 292.1 yen at 11:10 a.m., paring this
year’s loss to 3.4 percent.  The yen traded at 93.96 per dollar after dropping to 94.12,
nearing an almost three-year low of 94.77 reached on Feb. 25.
American companies added 198,000 workers in February, according
to a private report based on payrolls. The increase in
employment followed a revised 215,000 gain in January, figures
from the ADP Research Institute showed yesterday.  “Optimism about the U.S. recovery reduced investor demand
for the yen as a haven, weakening the currency and boosting
futures in Tokyo,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker
Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  The contract for September delivery in  Shanghai  fell 0.2
percent to 24,075  yuan  ($3,869) a ton. Thai rubber free-on-board
rose 0.6 percent to 89.25 baht ($3) a kilogram yesterday,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  Imports by members of the Association of Natural Rubber
Producing Countries, or ANRPC, may total 1.05 million tons in
the first quarter, compared with 1.06 million a year earlier,
the group said yesterday. Imports by China, the largest consumer,
jumped 17.6 percent in the first two months, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
