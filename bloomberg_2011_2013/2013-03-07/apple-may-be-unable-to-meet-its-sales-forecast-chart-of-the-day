Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s sales for the current
fiscal quarter may fail to meet the iPhone and iPad maker’s own
forecast as well as Wall Street’s projections, according to Glen Yeung, a Citigroup Inc. analyst.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the average second-quarter
sales estimates since Nov. 1, a month into the company’s fiscal
year, among analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Citigroup cut its revenue figure yesterday by 3.7 percent,
to $40.4 billion. Demand is falling for components used in the
iPhone 5 and the full-sized iPad, judging by contacts with
suppliers, Yeung and two colleagues wrote in a report.  “Share loss by Apple in both the tablet market and the
smartphone market” may be behind the drop, they wrote. Yeung,
based in  San Francisco , reduced sales and earnings projections
through fiscal 2015 and lowered a 12-month price estimate for
the stock by $20 a share, to $480.  Apple forecast $41 billion to $43 billion in second-quarter
revenue on Jan. 23, when the Cupertino, California-based company
released first-quarter results. Analysts’ average prediction has
held at $42.9 billion since Jan. 28. Forty-two analysts surveyed
expect the company to meet or beat its sales estimate.  Yeung is among 11 analysts with some version of a hold
rating on Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
total is the highest in about six years. Fifty others recommend
buying the stock, and there are three sell ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
