The percentage of Greek households
asked to pay bribes fell for a fourth year as austerity limited
Greeks’ ability to pay, according to a survey commissioned for
the watchdog  Transparency International Greece .  The survey by Public Issue for the anti-corruption watchdog
showed 8.6 percent of households received demands for bribes in
2012 compared with 10.2 percent in 2011 and 13.5 percent in
2008. Almost 70 percent of bribe demands came from the public
sector. The private sector accounted for 32 percent. The cost of
bribes last year was estimated at 420 million euros ($550
million) compared with 554 million euros in 2011 and 787 million
euros in 2009, the survey showed.  “For the first time since the beginning of the survey, the
estimated total cost of petty corruption does not exceed half a
billion euros,” the watchdog said today in a statement. Cash-
strapped Greeks affected by austerity measures helped reduce the
amount paid, it said.  Hospitals accounted for 45 percent of bribe demands from
the public sector with tax and town planning authorities each at
13.3 percent and 13 percent, respectively.  Greece , which has been locked out of markets since 2010, is
in a sixth year of a recession after pensions and wages were cut
and taxes raised to avert the euro area’s first financial
collapse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
