The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and the World Bank Group’s International Finance
Corp. are considering offering a loan for a wind farm in west
Crimea, Ukraine, developed by Turkey’s Guris Holding AS.  The loan would fund the first 126-megawatt phase of the
project in Chernomorske district, the London-based EBRD said on
its website. Guris, an Ankara-based construction company, is
considering using turbines from Spain’s  Gamesa Corp. (GAM)  Tecnologica
SA or Germany’s Fuhrlander Aktiengesellschaft, the EBRD said.  Guris said in January it won permission to build the plant,
with construction slated to start this year. The company is
developing the plant, which would have a total 250 megawatts of
generation, with Belgium’s GreenWorx Holding NV. The EBRD plans
to appoint an engineer to assess loans for the project, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
