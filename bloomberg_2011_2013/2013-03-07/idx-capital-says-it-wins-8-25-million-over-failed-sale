IDX Capital LLC said the company and
two former principals were awarded $8.25 million by a jury over
the actions of a former colleague that allegedly doomed a
$25 million buyout of the firm by  Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG)   The verdict couldnâ€™t be immediately confirmed in court
records. The inter-dealer broker said Jamie Cawley and Brady Halper were awarded damages yesterday after a six-week trial in
New York state  Supreme Court  in Manhattan.  John Noona, a lawyer for defendant Wesley Wang, a founder
and former managing director of Phoenix Partners Group LP, said
he will appeal. Cawley and Wang worked together previously at
Axiom Global Partners LLC, a New York-based credit-default swap
brokerage.  Cawley is now chief executive officer of Javelin Capital
Markets LLC, a swaps-trading system that said it plans to
register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a so-
called swaps-execution facility.  The case is IDX Capital v. Wesley Wang, 102806-2007, New
York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
