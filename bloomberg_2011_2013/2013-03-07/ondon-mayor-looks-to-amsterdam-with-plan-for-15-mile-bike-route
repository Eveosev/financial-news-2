London Mayor  Boris Johnson  plans to
build a 15-mile bike route across the U.K. capital as part of a
913 million-pound ($1.37 billion) plan to boost cycling.  The east-west track, which will follow Dutch examples in
segregating bicycles from other traffic, will be one of  Europe ’s
longest, Johnson said in a statement from the Greater London
Authority, adding that he also aims to change cycling’s image.  “I want to de-Lycrafy cycling,” said the mayor, who
regularly rides to his office and meetings in a business suit.
“I want to make it normal, something for everyone, something you
feel comfortable doing in your ordinary clothes. Our new routes
will give people the confidence to get in the saddle.”  Transport for London  will spend 600 million pounds in four
years on developing cycle paths running parallel to subway and
bus routes. Bike use on  London ’s main roads is up 173 percent
since 2001 and TfL aims to double it again over the next decade.  The GLA is also reviewing junctions including Blackfriars,
Vauxhall and Elephant & Castle with the aim of making them
safer. Other programs include off-site trials of eye-level
traffic lights and specialized roundabouts.  Johnson also plans to trial a rental program for electric
bikes, similar to the Barclay Cycle Hire plan added in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
