Federated Investors Inc. (FII) , the
Pittsburgh-based money manager, said Joseph M. Balestrino,
manager of its largest bond fund, will leave in April after 27
years with the firm.  Balestrino, 58, will be replaced as manager of the $7.6
billion  Total Return Bond Fund (FTRBX)  by Donald T. Ellenberger, 54, and
by Mark E. Durbiano, 53, on the $1.6 billion Strategic Income
Fund, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. The firm
said it expected Balestrino to be available for consulting after
his departure.  Federated’s Total Return Bond Fund returned 4.3 percent in
the 12 months through yesterday, trailing 64 percent of
competitors that include  Bill Gross ’s Pimco Total Return Fund,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Assets in Balestrino’s
fund declined 14 percent in the period while Gross’s fund grew
14 percent to $288 billion.  “Because of our experienced team, our clients can be
assured that we will continue to offer the same strategies and
processes that have earned our well-deserved reputation as a
strong fixed-income manager,” Robert J. Ostrowski, chief
investment officer for Federated’s taxable fixed-income group,
said in the statement.  Brian S. Ruffner, 46, will replace Balestrino as manager of
the $1.7 billion Federated Bond Fund; Bryan J. Dingle, 42, will
take over the $390 million Intermediate Corporate Bond Fund; and
Ihab L. Salib, 48, will take the reins of the $145 million
Unconstrained Bond Fund.  Federated had $379.8 billion in assets under management as
of Dec. 31, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
