Two of the five Tunisian parties
negotiating a new government withdrew from the talks,
undermining the search for a unity coalition that can ease
tensions.  The Wafa movement and the Freedom and Dignity bloc
announced they were quitting talks in separate statements today.
Wafa’s leader Abderraouf al-Ayadi cited disagreements over the
new government’s program, while Freedom and Dignity’s Mohamed
Tahir Ilahi said by phone that his party was being offered a
“merely decorative” role.  That leaves three parties still in negotiations: the social
democratic party Ettakatol, the secular Congress for the
Republic, and the moderate Islamist Ennahdha of Prime Minister
Ali Larayedh, which holds the most seats in parliament.  Tunisian politicians are seeking to defuse tensions that
heightened after the Feb. 6 assassination of opposition leader
Chukri Beleid, blamed on Islamists by many Tunisians. The
previous premier Hamadi Jbeli, also from Ennahdha, had promised
to form a technocratic government then quit after failing to do
so. Ennahdha has agreed to cede control of four key posts
including the interior and finance ministries.  Tunisia’s credit rating has been cut by Moody’s Investors
Service and Standard & Poor’s in the past month, with both
companies citing political instability and a worsening fiscal
outlook. The country is seeking a $1.8 billion IMF loan and
plans to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
