Gold snapped two days of gains as
investors weighed mixed U.S. economic data against the potential
for more stimulus measures from central banks around the world.
Silver fell for the first time in three days.  Spot gold lost as much as 0.3 percent to $1,579.25 an ounce,
and traded at $1,581.39 at 10:09 a.m. in  Singapore , taking
losses this year to 5.6 percent. Bullion also fell as the dollar
rose for a second day against a six-currency basket.  Data yesterday showed U.S. companies hired more workers
than expected, while orders to factories fell in January by the
most in five months. The Federal Reserve said that the world’s
largest economy is growing even as policy makers remain divided
on the pace of stimulus. European Central Bank policy makers
meet today after President Mario Draghi signaled last month the
bank has no intention of tightening monetary policy anytime soon.  “As economic data in the U.S. continues to be uneven, the
fate of the Federal Reserve’s easy monetary policy remains
unclear,” said Sun Yonggang, a macroeconomic strategist at
Everbright Futures Co., a unit of one of  China ’s largest state-
owned investment companies. “Depending on the mood of the
market, gold may trade with or against the dollar.”  The Dollar Index reached the highest level since August
yesterday. Gold fell for a fifth month in February, the longest
run of declines since 1997, amid speculation the Fed may rein in
stimulus as the recovery gains traction. Assets in exchange-
traded products holdings dropped to 2,491.503 metric tons on
March 5, the lowest level since September.  Gold for April delivery advanced 0.3 percent to $1,580 an
ounce on the Comex in New York after closing unchanged yesterday.  Cash bullion of 99.99 percent purity added 0.3 percent to
320.11  yuan  a gram ($1,599.78 an ounce) on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange. Daily volumes for the benchmark cash contract have
been more than double the average in 2012 since Feb. 18, when it
reached a record 22,024 kilograms, according to exchange data.  Cash silver declined as much as 0.5 percent to $28.89 an
ounce, and was at $28.935. Spot platinum climbed 0.2 percent to
$1,592.25 an ounce, and palladium slid 0.3 percent to $744.45 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
