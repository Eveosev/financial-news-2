Singapore  Exchange Ltd., Southeast
Asia’s largest bourse, may renegotiate its licensing deal to
trade London Metal Exchange contracts after Hong Kong Exchanges
& Clearing Ltd. bought the LME, according to the SGX president.  “It will get renegotiated,” Muthukrishnan Ramaswami said
in an interview in Singapore today. “We have the right to trade
it but are we going to trade without due cooperation from Hong
Kong? No.”  The Singapore Exchange started trading LME-SGX copper, zinc
and aluminum futures in 2011 and later added lead and steel
contracts. The futures, known as “mini”, are smaller in size
than those listed in London. LME-SGX zinc futures volume was two
lots in February while there was none in aluminum and copper,
SGX data show.  “We weren’t doing that great. It wasn’t a big business,”
Ramaswami said today. Miriam Heywood, an LME spokeswoman in
 London , declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
