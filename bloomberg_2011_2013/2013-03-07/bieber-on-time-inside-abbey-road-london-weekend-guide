Justin Bieber keeps apologizing for
setting off massive wailing among the teenagers he kept waiting
at his first London concert this week.  Presumably he’ll start on time tonight at the O2, with his
humble offerings of “Boyfriend” and more tracks from his CD
“Believe.”  O2, Peninsula Square, SE10 0DX, to March 8. Information:

O2 venues, the Gun is a good alternative. It’s a pub with decent
food and there’s a terrace beside the river.  Information:  http://www.thegundocklands.com/  or

decade ago? Its creator is back in London with another stunner.  For the  Hayward ’s “Light Show,” Olafur Eliasson has placed
27 miniature fountains under flickering strobe lights that make
the squirts and splashes look like freeze frames. The sound of
the water is nice, too.  Then there’s Anthony McCall’s elliptic projection: You’ll
feel like you’re on the moon. And the more you stare at James
Turrell’s wall-sized red planes, the more you’ll see.  “Light Show” ends April 28 at the Hayward Gallery, SE1 8XX.

844-875-0073.  Saturday Night  A loopy countess lives right under a Paris cafe.  It sounds like the perfect setup -- until a bunch of greedy
businessmen show up, spoiling the picture and spicing up the
plot of “Dear World” (which premiered on Broadway in 1969). The
fat cats try to blow up the cafe to drill for oil. The countess
takes them to court.  Broadway legend Betty Buckley puts in a commanding
performance as the wacky aristocrat.  “Dear World”  is at the
Charing Cross Theatre, WC2N 6NL. For more information:
 http://www.charingcrosstheatre.co.uk  or +44-844-493-0650.  Try Terroirs for unfussy French food with natural wines
from small producers as well as charcuterie and a range of
rustic dishes. These may include grilled Scottish langoustines;
and baby back ribs. Information:  http://terroirswinebar.com/  or

normally only see the outside of the studios, sign the wall
outside and walk across the crossing made famous by the Beatles.  This weekend is your chance to get a rare sight inside the
building, which is still used by many of the world’s top rock
and classical musicians.  The tours, by authors Brian Kehew and Kevin Ryan, run
through the narrow corridors and into the bare orchestra-sized
hall where the Beatles recorded “A Day In the Life.”  “Inside Abbey Road” tours run from March 8 through March 17
at Abbey Road Studios, 3 Abbey Rd, St. John’s Wood, London, NW8
9AY. Booking:  http://www.seetickets.com/tour/abbey-road-studios .
