Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) , the third-
largest U.S. household-products maker, approved a two-for-one
stock split and boosted its dividend 9.7 percent as it works to
keep the shares affordable and return cash to investors.  The record date for the split is April 23, and the shares
will be distributed on May 15, the New York-based company said
today in a statement. The quarterly dividend will rise to 68
cents per share on a pre-split basis from 62 cents.  Colgate, the maker of its namesake toothpaste, Irish Spring
soap and Ajax house cleaner, last split its shares in 1999,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The shares climbed 77
percent from the end of that year through yesterday, making them
the 41st highest-priced in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Consumer-products makers have been working to expand in
 emerging markets  and keep their products affordable amid rising
raw-materials prices. Colgate’s net income last year rose 1.7
percent to $2.47 billion, and the company generated $3.2 billion
in  cash  from operations, up 10 percent from 2011.  The shares rose 0.1 percent to $115.41 at the close in New
York. Colgate has gained 10 percent this year, compared with an
8.3 percent gain for the  S&P 500 .  Colgate’s $17 billion in sales last year ranked it behind
only  Procter & Gamble Co . and  Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB)  in revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
