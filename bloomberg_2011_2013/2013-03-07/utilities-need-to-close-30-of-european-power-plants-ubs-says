Utilities in  Europe  need to shut
more than 30 percent of their total gas, coal and oil-fed power
capacity by 2017 to counter a drop in prices caused by the boom
in renewable energy sources,  UBS AG (UBSN)  analysts said.  Producers must close 49 gigawatts of capacity to stabilize
profits at 2012 levels, analysts led by Paris-based Per Lekander
wrote in an e-mailed report. That includes 24 gigawatts of
“mainly cashflow positive capacity” on top of the 7 gigawatts
that utilities already plan to shut and an additional 18
gigawatts of closures expected to be announced, he wrote.  Germany ’s  next-year electricity  contract, a European
benchmark, has fallen 21 percent in the past year as power
produced from sources such as the sun and wind boost supply and
push down wholesale prices. The European Union wants to meet 20
percent of electricity demand with renewable sources by 2020.  “The most important driver has undoubtedly been the
remarkable increase of renewable capacity, and in particular
solar, mainly in Germany,” Lekander said.  Baseload German 2014 power, for supplies delivered around
the clock, was 41.35 euros ($53.61) a megawatt-hour at 3:50 p.m.
Berlin time, broker data on Bloomberg show. The contract fell to
as low as 40.25 euros on Feb. 1.  Mainly gas-fed  power plants  will be closed, while coal and
lignite-fueled stations will be affected from 2015, UBS said.  In Germany, gas fired plants are making a record loss of
17.84 euros a megawatt-hour based on power, gas and emissions
prices for  next month , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Energy Security  Widespread closures may face resistance from energy
regulators concerned about the impact on supply security,
Lekander said. Capacity that generates cash will also be
difficult to shut from a regulatory and competitive perspective,
he said.  Plants with a total 5 gigawatts of capacity are planned to
shut between now and 2018 because they’re uneconomic to run, UBS
said. Other closures also include 1.3 gigawatts from aging
facilities and 1.2 gigawatts under EU environmental laws.  GDF Suez SA (GSZ)  plans to halt its 627 megawatt Ruien gas and
coal-fed plant and its 294 megawatt gas-fired Awirs-5 unit in
 Belgium  in 2013. EON SE plans to close its Emile Huchet and Lucy
coal-fed plants in  France  by 2015.  EnBW Energie Baden-
Wuerttemberg AG (EBK)  will close its Neckarwestheim nuclear power
plant in Germany by 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
