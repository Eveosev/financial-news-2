Indonesia ’s two-year bonds rallied,
pushing the yield toward a record low, on speculation investors
are favoring shorter-term notes to guard against price swings
ahead of a central bank meeting today. The rupiah fell.  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. expects Bank Indonesia to be “more
hawkish” at the policy review, analysts led by  David Carbon 
wrote in a note, after inflation reached a 20-month high of 5.31
percent in February. Short-term bond prices tend to fluctuate
less than long-term ones as  interest rates  increase or decrease.
Global funds added 2.83 trillion rupiah ($292 million) to their
local-currency sovereign debt holdings this month through March
5, finance ministry data show.  The yield on the government’s 11 percent debt due October
2014 dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
4.28 percent as of 9:01 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association show. That is 10 basis points off an
all-time low of 4.18 percent reached on Feb. 15. The yield on
10-year notes was little changed at 5.33 percent. The central
bank may raise the lower limit for the so-called Fasbi, or the
rate it pays lenders on overnight deposits, in the coming
months, according to PT Bank CIMB Niaga. The floor rate is
currently at 4 percent.  “The market seeks security in short-term positions on
expectations the Fasbi may be raised in the coming meetings,”
said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in
Jakarta. “Investors’ perception of Indonesia’s credit is
positive, so short-term yields may continue to fall.”  Reference Rate  Bank Indonesia  will hold its benchmark  reference rate  at a
record-low 5.75 percent for a 13th month today, according to all
21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable weakened 0.02
percent to 9,725 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
They traded at a 0.3 percent discount to the spot rate, which
declined 0.1 percent to 9,694, prices from local banks show. A
daily  fixing  used to settle rupiah derivatives was set at 9,688
yesterday, from 9,709 on March 5, by the Association of Banks in
 Singapore .  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, added
seven basis points to 5.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
