The Philippine peso weakened on
speculation the central bank will temper appreciation after
capital inflows drove the benchmark  stock index  to an all-time
high yesterday.  Government bonds  rose.  The peso halted a two-day gain after Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said policy makers are
considering taking steps, including cutting  interest rates  on
special-deposit accounts, to ease currency pressure. The central
bank last lowered rates on those accounts on Jan. 24.  “We still expect a cut in SDA rates, with room for up to a
full percentage point,” said Patrick Ella, an economist in
 Manila  at Security Bank Corp. “This move will weaken the
peso.”  The peso declined 0.1 percent to 40.732 per dollar in
Manila, according to data from Tullett Prebon Plc. It has
climbed 0.8 percent this year. The central bank may be
comfortable with a rate between 40.70 and 40.80, Ella said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
exchange-rate moves used to price options, fell three basis
points or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.89 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Foreign investors have pumped a net $853 million into the
nation’s stocks this year, exchange data show. The Philippine
Composite Index has rallied 16 percent in 2013. It lost 1.6
percent today.  The government injected 20 billion pesos ($491 million)
into the central bank in 2012 to help stabilize the currency and
support the economy, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said in an
e-mailed statement on March 5.  The yield on the 5.75 percent notes due September 2032 fell
one basis point to 4.79 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services. The rate has plunged 82 basis points since
Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
