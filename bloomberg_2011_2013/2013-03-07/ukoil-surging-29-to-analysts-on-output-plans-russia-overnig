Analysts are the most optimistic on
 OAO Lukoil (LUKOY)  stock since November, predicting a 29 percent rally
in the next 12 months, as the Russian oil producer says it will
use last year’s record profit to boost output.  Lukoil climbed for a fourth day in Moscow and New York,
with the company’s American depositary receipts posting the
second-biggest advance on the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN) 
of the most-traded Russian stocks in the U.S. yesterday. The
measure fell 0.4 percent to 101.49 yesterday, while RTS stock
index  futures  rose 0.2 percent to 153,320 in U.S. hours.  Russia ’s second-largest oil producer will invest more than
$16 billion this year to lift output by 18 percent by the end of
2015, Chief Executive Officer  Vagit Alekperov  said yesterday,
after Lukoil reported record 2012 net income of $11 billion. The
Moscow  shares , which jumped 0.9 percent yesterday to 2,010.20
rubles, or $65.47, will rise to 2,585.04 rubles in the next
year, according to the  average  of 21 analyst price targets
compiled by Bloomberg. Fifteen rate the stock buy.  “I like Lukoil more now than I did before,” Andrey Polischuk, an analyst at ZAO Raiffeisenbank in Moscow who rates
the shares hold, said by phone yesterday.“They are able to
increase production this year and further increase revenue.”  ADRs of Lukoil rose 1.4 percent to $66 in New York
yesterday, the steepest jump since Feb. 13. They traded at a 0.9
percent premium to the company’s shares on Moscow’s benchmark
Micex Index, the most since Nov. 16. Lukoil climbed 8.9 percent
in Moscow over the past year and trades at 4.44 times estimated
earnings, the second-lowest  valuation  among 15 global oil
producers tracked by Bloomberg after Moscow-based  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP) 
at 4.3 times.  Output Growth  Lukoil is counting on deposits in Siberia, the  Caspian Sea ,
 Iraq  and Uzbekistan to drive output growth after recording its
first production increase since 2009 in September, according to
preliminary Energy Ministry data released Oct. 2.  While oil output fell 1.3 percent last year, natural gas
production grew 10 percent, the company said yesterday. Crude
production will be little changed this year at about 1.83
million barrels a day, Vice President Azat Shamsuarov said in
 London  yesterday, before climbing to 2.05 million barrels a day
next year and 2.15 million barrels in 2015.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, fell 0.1 percent to $29.05
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the  stock futures , retreated 3.2 percent to 19.67.  Higher Dividend  Lukoil will consider boosting dividend payout ratios from
next year when investment demands ease, CEO Alekperov said. The
Moscow-based company will distribute 23 percent of net income in
2012 and is looking to boost shareholder payments to 30 percent
of profit in the medium term, he said.  “Dividends are higher than what we expected,”  Alexei Kokin , an analyst at UralSib Financial Corp. who rates the stock
buy, said by phone yesterday from Moscow. “It would be good if
they increase dividends faster.”  OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil unit of Russia’s natural gas
export monopoly, led gains on the Bloomberg-Russia gauge
yesterday, rising 1.9 percent to $23.12 and boosting its premium
to the Moscow shares by 1.9 percent, the biggest gap since Sept.
13. The shares climbed 0.5 percent to 139.49 rubles, or $4.54
yesterday. One ADR equals five ordinary shares.  Oil Trading  Crude for April settlement increased 1.3 percent to $91.56
per barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday as
first-time jobless claims unexpectedly fell in U.S. last week.  Brent crude  for April settlement on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange settled advanced 9 cents to $111.15 a barrel. Urals
crude slid less than 0.1 percent to $107.90.  Russia’s ruble strengthened less than 0.1 percent to
30.6975 per dollar. The currency lost 0.3 percent to 34.9770
against the dollar-euro basket used by Russia’s central bank to
manage swings that erode exporter competitiveness. Ruble’s
futures showed the currency weakening less than 0.1 percent
against the dollar at 30.732 in U.S. hours.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
lost 1.2 percent to HK$4.18 in Hong Kong trading as of 9:55 a.m.
local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
