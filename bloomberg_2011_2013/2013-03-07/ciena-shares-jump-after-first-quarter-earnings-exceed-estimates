Ciena Corp. (CIEN) , which makes networking
equipment for  AT&T Inc. (T)  and Verizon Communications Inc., jumped
the most in 18 months and helped push competitors’ stocks higher
with a surprise first-quarter profit.  Excluding some items, Ciena posted earnings of 12 cents a
share in the period, which ended Jan. 31, according to a
statement today. Analysts had estimated a loss of 14 cents a
share on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While the economy and technology spending have been stable,
customers have been favoring newer networking technology over
conventional equipment sales, Chief Executive Officer Gary Smith
said in an interview.  “This was our best profitability since the downturn,”
said Smith. “I think it shows an inflection point in buying
trends.”  The company expects positive cash flow in 2013 based on the
higher order rate it is seeing, Chief Financial Officer James Moylan said on the call.  Ciena, based in Hanover,  Maryland ,  climbed  17 percent to
$17.53 at the close in New York, the biggest one-day gain since
Sept. 1, 2011. The stock had dropped 4.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8.1 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The report helped lift other communications-equipment
suppliers.  JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU)  shares rose 7.6 percent to $15.23,
and  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)  gained 5 percent to $21.12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
