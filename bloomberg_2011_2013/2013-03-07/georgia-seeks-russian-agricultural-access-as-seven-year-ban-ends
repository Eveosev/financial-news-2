Georgia wants to regain  market
access  for its agricultural products including cheese, fruit,
vegetables and meat to Russia, which effectively ended a ban on
wine and  mineral water  imports from the former Soviet republic.  A delegation will travel to Moscow this month to complete
the talks, Davit Kirvalidze, Georgia’s agriculture minister,
told reporters today in the capital, Tbilisi.  Russian inspectors have carried out the first round of
sanitation checks in Georgia, paving the way for more than 40
producers of wine and mineral water to register in Russia after
a seven-year embargo, Russia’s public health chief,  Gennady
Onishchenko , said yesterday.  Georgia’s return to the Russian market would mark a victory
for Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a Russian-trained
economist and engineer who promised to improve political and
economic ties with the country’s northern neighbor following his
upset election victory in October over the party of President
Mikhail Saakashvili.  Russia imposed a ban on Georgian wine, mineral water and
agricultural products in 2006, extending the embargo to postal
and transport links after the two countries fought a war over a
Georgian breakaway region in 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
