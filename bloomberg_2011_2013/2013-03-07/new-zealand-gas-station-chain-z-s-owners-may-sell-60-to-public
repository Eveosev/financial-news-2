The owners of Z Energy Ltd., a gas
station operator that supplies a third of  New Zealand ’s fuel,
may list it on the nation’s stock exchange as they prepare to
sell a stake to the public.  Joint investors  Infratil Ltd. (IFT)  and the New Zealand
Superannuation Fund may sell as much as 60 percent of the
company in a public share sale in the third quarter, they said
in a statement. No final decision had been made on the listing,
which would depend on market conditions, they said.  “Z Energy has strong cash-flows, a good dividend outlook
and growth options which would suit a wider investor audience,”
Infratil Chief Executive Officer Marko Bogoievski said.  Infratil and the Superannuation Fund bought Z Energy from
Shell Oil Co. in 2010 and then rebranded Shell gas stations as Z
throughout New Zealand. The investors want to keep stakes in the
company of between 20 percent and 30 percent if the sale
proceeds, according to the statement.  Z Energy earned NZ$1.49 billion ($1.2 billion) of revenue
in the six months to Sept. 30, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
