Hog futures surged the most in eight
weeks as slumping U.S. pork prices fueled speculation that
demand for the meat will increase as consumers shift from more-
expensive beef or poultry cuts. Cattle declined.  The value of a 200-pound (91-kilogram) hog carcass fell to
79.41 cents a pound yesterday, a  discount  of $1.17 to the same
amount of beef, according to the U.S Department of Agriculture.
Meatpackers slaughtered 1.283 million hogs in the first three
days of this week, up 1.6 percent from a year earlier, USDA data
show.  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  said today that pork prices will
rise in 2013 on reduced beef supplies.  “Pork has gotten cheap relative to beef, and supermarkets
will take advantage of that discount,” David Kruse, a commodity
trading adviser at Commstock Investments Inc. in Royal,  Iowa ,
said in a telephone interview. “We are reaching the seasonal
peak in hog slaughter and should see supplies begin to taper off
1 or 2 percent into the summer, further boosting demand for
hogs.”  Hog futures for April settlement rose 2.5 percent to 81.2
cents a pound at 9:45 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
heading for the biggest gain since Jan. 11. Yesterday, the most-
active futures touched 78.25 cents, the lowest since Nov. 7. The
price through yesterday was down 7.6 percent this year.  Deutsche Bank AG advised clients today in a report to close
short hog positions because pork has become a better value
relative to chicken, which should attract more demand from
consumers and retailers. The bank also said a USDA report on
March 28 may show fewer hogs were bred in the quarter that ended
March 1.  Cattle futures for April delivery slid less than 0.1
percent to $1.28775 a pound on the CME, heading for the third
straight decline.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement rose 0.2 percent
to $1.44875 a pound, after fluctuating between gains and losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
