Canada recorded the smallest
 merchandise trade  deficit in almost a year in January on higher
exports of crude oil and bitumen.  The deficit of C$237 million ($230 million) followed a
revised December shortfall of C$332 million, Statistics Canada
said today in Ottawa. Economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg forecast
the deficit would be C$600 million, based on the median of 20
forecasts.  The Bank of Canada is relying in part on exports to drive
economic growth this year as policy makers say record consumer
debt levels will slow housing investment. Policy makers
yesterday softened language on the need to raise interest rates,
saying that while the global recovery is proceeding as expected,
the domestic economy has “material excess capacity.”  Exports rose 2.1 percent to C$39.1 billion in January, led
by a 6.7 percent increase in energy to C$9.15 billion. Imports
rose 1.9 percent to C$39.3 billion, Statistics Canada said.  The volume of exports advanced 0.9 percent and import
volumes rose 1.8 percent, Statistics Canada said. Volume figures
adjust for price changes and can be a better indicator of how
trade contributes to economic growth.  The  surplus with the U.S.  widened to C$4.25 billion in
January from C$4.03 billion a month earlier.  Exports make up about one-third of Canada’s economy, with
about 75 percent of  the shipments  going to the U.S.  Statistics Canada revised its estimate of December’s trade
deficit to C$332 million from C$901 million after receiving
updated data on energy shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
