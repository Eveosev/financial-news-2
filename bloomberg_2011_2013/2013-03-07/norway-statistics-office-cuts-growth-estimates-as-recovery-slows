Norway ’s economy will expand at a
slower pace than previously forecast as weaker demand from
crisis-hit Europe and a strong krone hurt exports,  Statistics
Norway  said.  The  mainland economy , which excludes income from oil and
shipping industries, will grow 2.6 percent this year and 3.1
percent next year, down from 3.5 percent in 2012, the Oslo-based
agency said today. This compares with December growth forecasts
of 2.9 percent for 2013 and 3.5 percent for 2014. In 2015, non-
oil output will expand 2.8 percent, the agency said.  “Activity growth in the Norwegian economy fell toward the
end of 2012 and is expected to show a moderate development going
forward,” the agency said. “The economic downturn among
Norway’s trading partners is set to continue well into 2015.
Together with continual losses of cost-competitiveness in
Norwegian businesses, this will lead to a weak development in
traditional Norwegian exports.”  A recession in  Europe  has started to hurt the world’s
fourth-richest nation per capita. Exporters are struggling to
cope with a record high  import-weighted krone  and slowing demand
from the debt-burdened euro area. Mainland exports are estimated
to fall 0.2 percent this year after rising 2.6 percent last
year, SSB said.  Krone Steady  The krone, which hit a nine-year high against the euro last
year, weakened 0.2 percent to 7.4367 by 11:03 a.m. in Oslo.  The agency forecast the currency will be at 7.3 per euro in
2013 and 2014.  Norges Bank has kept its  benchmark deposit rate  unchanged
at 1.5 percent since March to prevent policy from growing too
out of step with other central banks as it strives to limit
krone gains. Surging  house prices  and rising private debt levels
have prompted policy makers to signal a rate increase as early
as this month.  Weaker than estimated economic growth may prompt policy
makers to wait until next year before raising rates, according
to  Erik Bruce , senior economist at Nordea Bank AB, who forecasts
unchanged rates until March 2014.  “Norges Bank will try to avoid a strengthening of the
krone,” Bruce said by phone. “It’s hard to increase interest
rates in Norway without a stronger krone and a stronger krone
will turn into weaker growth and lower inflation.”  Oil Investments  A slowdown in the pace of investments in the country’s oil
and gas industry this year may also add to rate pressures. The
statistics agency yesterday lowered its estimate for investments
to 198.7 billion kroner in 2013 from a December estimate of
207.8 billion kroner. The agency surveys oil companies on a
quarterly basis.  Total gross domestic product will expand 2.4 percent this
year, 2.6 percent next year and 2.2 in 2015, SSB said.  Unemployment will be 3.4 percent this year, next year and
in 2015, the agency said. Underlying inflation will be 1.2
percent and 1.6 percent this year and next, respectively, the
agency forecast. Price growth is seen at 1.9 percent in 2015,
below the central bank’s 2 percent target.  In two separate releases the statistics office said the
pace of annual  credit growth  in Norway had slowed to 6.3 percent
in January from 6.5 percent in December, while  industrial
production  fell 7.5 percent in January from a year earlier.  Norges Bank policy makers will next meet on March 14 to
decide on  interest rates .  “We think interest rates abroad will be very low so there
really isn’t room for any strong increase in rates in Norway due
to the problems with a stronger krone if they did and inflation
is not a problem in Norway,” Bruce said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
