RIT Capital Partners Plc (RCP) , the U.K.
investment trust led by  Jacob Rothschild , increased its holdings
of publicly traded equities, saying its investment focus has
shifted more toward growth.  The proportion of the fund invested in equities and futures
increased to 61 percent at the year-end from 51 percent in
September, the London-based firm said in a statement today.
Rothschild said the firm targeted an improving U.S. economy and
also boosted its holdings of Japanese stocks in the final
quarter.  “We felt that the impact of reflationary policies against
an undervalued stock market provided us with an exceptional
investment opportunity,” he said. “Equally these policies were
negative for the currency and we took a net short yen
position.”  RIT said today net asset value rose to 1,309 pence a share
at Feb. 22, a record, and assets stood at more than 2 billion
pounds ($3 billion) for the first time in the firm’s history.
RIT will pay dividends of 14 pence a share in April and October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
