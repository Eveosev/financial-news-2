PNE Wind U.K. , a unit of  Germany ’s
 PNE Wind AG (PNE3) , said  Scotland  will be its focus as it develops as
much as 591 megawatts of onshore wind farms in Britain, enough
to power about 260,000 homes.  All but one of its sites are in Scotland, where acquiring
permits can be swifter than elsewhere, Managing Director George
Mager said in a telephone interview.  “Planning consent and the time it takes to get planning
consent is a key issue,” Mager said, citing the visual impact
of wind farms as one obstacle. The Scottish government, which is
“very supportive” of land-based wind, is working to help local
authorities process applications more quickly, he said.  Scotland has promoted wind energy as it seeks to get all of
its power from renewables by 2020, up from about 35 percent now.
In  England , onshore wind farms have caused controversy after
about 100 Conservative Party lawmakers lobbied Prime Minister
David Cameron in 2012 to cut subsidies for such projects, saying
they’re an intermittent power source that blight the landscape.  Of the 591 megawatts, PNE has submitted planning
applications for four farms totaling 120 megawatts, while the
rest are yet to be submitted for consent, Mager said. In
addition, the Forestry Commission in Scotland has awarded the
company exclusive rights to develop 100 to 200 megawatts over
the next five years.  PNE Wind U.K., based in Edinburgh, is only looking at one
site south of the border, in Northumberland, according to Mager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
