Google Inc. (GOOG) , operator of the world’s
largest Web-search engine, has passed  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to become the
most-owned stock by the 50 biggest actively managed U.S. mutual
funds, according to a report by Citigroup Inc.  Among hedge funds, Google was also the top holding,
according to the report, which examined investments at the end
of the fourth quarter for the largest funds by asset size.  Google’s shares are now trading at about 25 times profit,
compared with a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 10 for
Apple, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. That gap is at
its widest since June 2005, two years before competition between
the two companies in mobile devices began to intensify.  Under Chief Executive Officer  Larry Page , Google has
extended a lead in Web search, boosting its  share  to 67 percent,
and in smartphone software, where it commands 70 percent of the
market. That helps the Mountain View, California-based company
benefit from two big shifts -- the boom in tablets and
smartphones away from traditional computers and the move toward
digital advertising.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, is undergoing
slowing revenue growth and narrowing margins amid accelerating
mobile competition led by Samsung Electronics Co. and other
users of Google’s Android operating system. A year and a half
after the death of co-founder  Steve Jobs , Apple is working to
release new products that can build on the successes of the iPod
music player, the iPhone smartphone and the iPad tablet
computer, which revolutionized their respective industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
