The hundreds of pages of tedious
documents that govern every corporate bond sold are suddenly a
hot commodity as traders look for an edge with the biggest bull
market ever in junk debt slowing.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) ’s $1.3 billion of 6.775 percent
notes climbed to a record 104.5 cents on the dollar in a wager
that the natural gas producer has run out of time to repurchase
the debt at par, or 100 cents, as allowed by the debt’s
covenants. Plano, Texas-based  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) ’s 7.125 percent
notes due 2023 have risen 9 percent this month, even as the rest
of its debt plummets, in a bet the retailer will be forced to
repay the issue early because of a covenant breach.  High-yield, high-risk bonds are posting their worst start
to a year since 2009 after returns soared more than 118 percent
from the end of 2008 through December. Now, an increasing number
of investors are being forced to take advantage of little-
noticed provisions in deal documents to gain an edge, according
to Adam Cohen, the founder of Covenant Review, an independent
research firm in New York.  At this phase in the credit cycle, “you have to be a
manager that truly understands what’s happening and why,”
Matthew Duch, who helps manage $12 billion in assets at Calvert
Investments Inc. in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a telephone
interview. “You’re going to have to avoid blowups and
understand the credits and the prospectuses much more closely
than in the past of buying and just holding.”  ‘Sloppy’ Language  Investors began pushing up the price of Chesapeake’s 2019
notes last month to take advantage of “sloppy” language in the
deal documents, according to Covenant Review’s Cohen. Those
securities rose above par even though the bond covenant has a
redemption provision based on a March 15 date. The debt has
since declined to 103.5 cents.  Some traders believe that the company is wrong that it can
redeem the notes at par and that Chesapeake would have to pay a
substantial premium if it wanted to repurchase them, Cohen said.
If a so-called make-whole call provision were triggered, the
company would have to pay bondholders as much $400 million in
addition to the principal amount of the notes.  “The value of litigating the position may be high enough
to make a little legal spending on a narrow issue worthwhile,”
Cohen wrote in a March 1 report. “Hiring a law firm to
challenge the narrow issue of a par call would be relatively
inexpensive.”  Jim Gipson, a spokesman for Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake,
said he couldn’t immediately comment.  Corporate Takeovers  The lowest borrowing rates on record engineered by the
Federal Reserve have helped propel $86.6 billion of corporate
takeovers in the U.S. in February, the busiest month since July
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors are
poring over deal documents to determine the consequences of
corporate actions on outstanding bonds and whether any
provisions haven’t been exploited by the market, Cohen said.  “Indenture plays heat up during two periods: high mergers-
and-acquisitions activity and high levels of distress,” Cohen
said yesterday in an e-mail. “The past three months have been
hot.”  Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
corporate debt from default in the U.S. fell, with the Markit
CDX North American Investment Grade Index, which investors use
to hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness,
decreasing 0.5 basis point to a mid-price of 83.2 basis points
as of 11:29 a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  Rate Swaps  The index, which ended March 5 at the lowest level since
Sept. 14, typically falls as investor confidence improves and
rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress rose from a seven-week low, increasing 0.61
basis point to 14.05 basis points as of 11:26 a.m. in New York.
The gauge widens when investors seek the perceived safety of
government securities and narrows when they favor assets such as
company debentures.  GE Bonds  Bonds of Fairfield, Connecticut-based General Electric Co.
are the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate
securities by dealers today, accounting for 4.6 percent of the
volume of dealer trades of $1 million or more, at 11:25 a.m. in
New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Average returns on junk bonds have slowed to 2.2 percent
this year, the least for the period since a 1.7 percent loss in
2009, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High
Yield index. The debt gained 15.6 percent in 2012.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
rather than government debt has contracted by 13.2 percentage
points since the end of 2008 to 4.88 percentage points as the
Fed’s bond-purchasing program and policy of holding benchmark
borrowing rates between zero and 0.25 percent enter a fifth
year.  Junk notes will likely gain 3.1 percent this year, with a
worst-case scenario of a 4.8 percent decline and maximum of 5.6
percent returns, Morgan Stanley credit strategists Adam Richmond
and Jason Ng in New York wrote in a report published Dec. 4. The
base case would be the least since the 26 percent loss for the
notes four years ago.  ‘Home Run’  High-yield or junk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor’s.  Investors have set their sights on J.C. Penney debt after
its $552 million fourth-quarter loss, the retailer’s worst
performance since 2004, which is leading analysts from
CreditSights Inc. to S&P to predict it may have to draw down on
a $1.85 billion revolving credit facility to fund operations.  Holders of the company’s $254.5 million of 7.125 percent
bonds are wagering that such an action may cause the retailer to
breach a restriction, forcing it to buy back the notes at a
premium to their current price, Cohen said. He wrote in a Feb.
13 report that he thought such an outcome was unlikely.  “If you think it can’t be breached, the yield for those
bonds should be in line with all the other J.C. Penney bonds,”
Cohen said in an interview.  The notes, which traded as low as 83 cents Jan. 15,
increased to 94.25 cents yesterday to yield 7.93 percent, Trace
data show. That’s higher than the 76.6-cent weighted average of
J.C. Penney’s five biggest bonds, Bloomberg data show.  Joey Thomas, a spokesman for J.C. Penney, didn’t
immediately respond to a telephone call seeking comment.  “There are funds that spend a lot of time looking at bond
covenants to see if there are any mistakes or breaches,”
Salvatore Naro, chief executive officer of New York-based
Coherence Capital Partners LLC, which manages $100 million, said
in a telephone interview. “If it works out, obviously you hit a
home run.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
