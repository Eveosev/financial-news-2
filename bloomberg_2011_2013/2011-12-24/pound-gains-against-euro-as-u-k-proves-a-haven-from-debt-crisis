The pound gained for a third week
against the euro as investors favored British assets after
European Union leaders struggled to resolve the region’s
sovereign debt crisis.  Sterling reached its strongest level since January versus
the 17-nation euro while gains by U.K. gilts pushed the 10-year
yield below 2 percent for the first time.  Europe ’s sovereign
debt crisis may hurt the real economy and the outlook for
financial stability has worsened,  Mervyn King , vice chairman of
the European Systemic Risk Board, said on Dec. 22.  “Sterling is going to benefit immensely as a new breed of
safe haven,” said Elizabeth Gregory, a market strategist at
Swissquote Bank SA in Geneva. “The U.K. and Scandinavian
countries are among the better insulated. The out-performance of
the pound is a sign of bigger things to come.”  The pound advanced 0.6 percent to 83.43 pence per euro as
of 4:17 p.m. London time yesterday, pushing its gain during 2011
to 2.8 percent. It was 0.5 percent stronger at $1.5624, little
changed since Dec. 31.  U.K. gilts rose as data added to signs the economic
recovery may stall, strengthening the case for the  Bank of
England  to add to asset purchases next year.  The  yield  on 10-year gilts was at 2.04 percent yesterday,
after being as low as 1.996 percent, the least since Bloomberg
started tracking the data in 1989. The 3.75 percent securities
due September 2021 gained 0.02, or two pence per 1,000-pound
face amount this week to 114.99.  Gilt Returns  Gilts have returned 16 percent this year through Dec. 22,
including reinvested interest, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German  government bonds  gained 8.97 percent and U.S.
Treasuries have returned 9.53 percent, the indexes show.  Investors bought British bonds this year as an alternative
to assets denominated in the euro as European Union leaders
struggled to solve a debt crisis that forced  Greece , Ireland and
 Portugal  to seek international bailouts. The turmoil also
engulfed Italy and Spain and prompted the bloc to create funds
to help stricken economies.  U.K. bonds may extend gains next week as Hometrack Ltd. and
 Nationwide Building Society  release their gauges for  house
prices . The average cost of a home fell 0.2 percent in November,
Hometrack said on Nov. 28. Lenders approved fewer home loans
than economists predicted last month, data from the London-based
British Bankers’ Association showed yesterday.  Sterling has advanced 0.7 percent in 2011 against nine
developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The dollar is 1.1 percent stronger and the euro has
lost 1.4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
