Quiznos Corp. , the closely held
sandwich chain, reached an agreement with creditors that may
help it avoid bankruptcy.  The restructuring deal with a “significant majority” of
first- and second-lien lenders will provide $150 million in new
equity capital, the Denver-based company said today in a
statement. The pact will cut $300 million from Quiznos’ debt
load, almost one-third of the total, and make Avenue Capital
Group LLC the majority owner.  Quiznos will shelve a backup plan to file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy if it can persuade all of the lien holders to accept
the restructuring. The company also intends to ask for
concessions from other creditors, it said in the statement.  “The terms of the pre-packaged Chapter 11 plan would
provide less favorable treatment for the lenders and certain
other creditors and landlords than under the proposed out-of-
court exchange offer,” the company said.  Quiznos owners include CCMP Capital Advisors LLC, Quiznos
founder Rick Schaden and Consumer Capital Partners, the private
equity firm he started.  To contact the reporter on this story:
