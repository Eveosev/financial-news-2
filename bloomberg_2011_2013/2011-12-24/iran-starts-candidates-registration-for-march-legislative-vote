Iran  started registration today for
candidates who are seeking to run in the country’s parliamentary
election planned for March 2, according to state-owned  Press TV .  Potential candidates have a week to sign up, the Tehran-
based broadcaster reported. Iranian authorities will assess
their backgrounds between Dec. 31 and Jan. 9 to ensure they are
suitable to participate in the contest, with a weeklong campaign
starting Feb. 23, officials said in October.  The election will take place as Iran is coming under
increasing political and economic pressure from the U.S. and its
allies over a controversial nuclear program. European Union
foreign ministers are scheduled to meet next month to discuss
possible sanctions on Iranian oil, the second-largest producer
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  In the last parliamentary elections, which were held in
March 2008, the Interior Ministry approved about 5,000
candidates to run in the Shiite Muslim-led nation. Prior to
this, the Council of Guardians had rejected almost a third of
the applicants citing reasons including their “undertakings
against the Islamic Republic,” or “lack of belief in Islamic
values.”  The majority of the seats in the elections were won by
factions loyal to the tenets of the country’s regime, including
supporters of President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .  To contact the reporter on this story:
