Spanish  two-year government notes 
fell for the second time in three weeks as optimism faded that
the  European Central Bank ’s offer of three-year loans to banks
will boost confidence in the region’s sovereign borrowers.  Italy’s 10-year rates advanced for a second week, passing
the 7 percent level that pushed  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to
seek bailouts. The Frankfurt-based ECB allotted 489 billion
euros ($645 billion) in 1,134-day loans on Dec. 21, almost
double the median estimate of 293 billion euros in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists. German and  Dutch two-year  yields
dropped to records as concern that the euro-area economy will
stall next year spurred demand for the region’s safest assets.  “The market maybe got a little over-excited ahead of the
loan operation,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist
at  Credit Agricole  Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “What
materialized wasn’t the great euphoria that some had expected.
It didn’t serve to be a game-changing event.”  Spanish two-year note yields rose 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, over the week to 3.64 percent at 4:12 p.m. in
London yesterday. The 2.5 percent security maturing in October
2013 fell 0.3, or 3 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 97.995.  Ten-year Spanish rates climbed six basis points to 5.37
percent. Ten-year Italian yields fell eight basis points to 6.93
percent. The yield on the securities  surged more than 2
percentage points  this year as Europe’s debt crisis intensified,
driving up borrowing costs across the region.  Growth Prospects  Growth prospects in  Europe  have worsened since September,
U.K. central bank Governor Mervyn King said yesterday after a
risk assessment by European officials. The European Central Bank
cut its 2012 euro-area growth forecast this month to 0.3
percent.  ECB policy makers shouldn’t shirk from using quantitative
easing if deflation becomes a danger to the euro region,
Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said in a Financial
Times interview published Dec. 22.  German  two-year rates  were little changed over the week,
after falling to a record of 0.201 percent yesterday. Dutch two-
year yields reached a euro-era low 0.265 percent on Dec. 20.  Italian 10-year bonds may decline next week as the nation
prepares to sell bonds and bills. It will auction 9 billion
euros of 179-day bills on Dec. 28 and debt maturing in 2014,
2018, 2021 and 2022 on Dec. 29.  Italy  and Spain have about 149
billion euros of bonds and bills maturing in the first quarter
of next year, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  “Next week’s auctions may put some pressure on Italy,”
Credit Agricole’s Chatwell said.  Spanish  government bonds  have handed investors a gain of
5.1 percent this year through Dec. 22, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. German bunds gained 9 percent and
Italian debt lost 5.8 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
