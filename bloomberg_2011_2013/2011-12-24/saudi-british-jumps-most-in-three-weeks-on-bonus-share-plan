Saudi British Bank (SABB)  surged the most
in three weeks after the board of the lender, which is 40
percent owned by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , proposed raising the bank’s
capital through bonus shares.  The stock surged as much as 4.4 percent, the largest
intraday gain since Dec. 3, to 40.50 riyals, and traded at 39.90
riyals at 11:29 a.m. in Riyadh.  The board of the Riyadh-based lender proposed to increase
the bank’s capital by 33 percent to 10 billion riyals ($2.7
billion) by awarding one bonus share for every three held. It
also said it will pay a dividend of 0.65 riyals a share for
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
