Former Russian Finance Minister
 Alexei Kudrin  is ready to mediate the dialog between the civil
society in  Russia  and the authorities,  Kommersant  reported.  Protests earlier this month in Moscow’s Bolotnaya Square
show that society doesn’t tolerate violations during the
parliamentary elections, Kudrin wrote in an article in the
newspaper today. He shares “negative emotions” regarding the
elections, he said.  President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s initiatives Dec. 22 to
liberalize political system demonstrated that Russian
authorities are eager to react to people’s discontent, while
protesters are still being perceived as “foam” and
“provocateurs,” Kudrin wrote.  The former minister, ousted by Dmitry Medvedev in September
for insubordination, said he’s confident that “gradual non-
violent transformation” of Russia’s political system is
possible, and honest presidential elections on March 4 with
results “accepted by society” may lay a foundation for this.  To contact the reporter on this story:
