Iran  will earn $110 billion from
crude oil production in the Iranian calendar year that ends
March 19, the state-run  Mehr  news agency said, citing a member
of the parliament’s economic committee, Gholamreza Mesbahi-
Moghadam.  Crude oil output in Iran, the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries’ second-largest oil producer after  Saudi
Arabia , totaled 4.3 million barrels a day in 2010 and 4.2
million barrels the previous year, Mehr said, without saying
where it got the information.  Iran pumped 3.56 million barrels of oil a day in November
and 3.575 million in October, according to data compiled by
