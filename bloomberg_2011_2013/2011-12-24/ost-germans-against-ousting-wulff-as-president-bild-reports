Almost half of German voters have
little or no trust in President  Christian Wulff ,  Bild am Sonntag 
said, citing a survey conducted by  Emnid  GmbH.  Still, 73 percent of those surveyed are against him
stepping down, according to the poll. Fifty percent of Germans
say they believe Wulff used his position to “help friends,”
while 63 percent accept his apology for failing to disclose a
loan provided by a businessman’s wife in 2008 when he was state
premier of  Lower Saxony , the newspaper reported.  The newspaper gave no detail of the number of people
surveyed by Emnid, or when the poll was conducted and how.  To contact the reporter on this story:
