The National Iranian Oil Co. signed
a deal valued at $1.4 billion with Iranian Oil Industries
Engineering and Construction Co. to build the country’s largest
natural-gas liquids plant, the  Mehr   news agency  reported.  The plant will have the capacity to turn 270 million cubic
feet a day of gas associated with oil into liquid, the state-run
news agency said. The plant will be in operation in less than
four years, Mehr said.  Iran ’s Oil Ministry plans to build another plant in the
country’s Kharg Island to bring to zero by 2015 the volume of
gases burned at its oilfields, which amount to a $3 billion loss
annually, Mehr reported, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
