Japan ’s government said it will
increase bond sales to the market to a record 149.7 trillion yen
($1.9 trillion) in the fiscal year starting April 1.  The amount for investors such as banks and life insurers is
4.8 trillion yen more than 144.9 trillion yen in the initial
plan for fiscal 2011. Total debt issuance, including securities
to replace maturing debt and so-called zaito bonds sold for
government agencies, will increase by 4.6 trillion yen to a
record 174.2 trillion yen.  Sales of new financing bonds intended to plug the
government’s budget deficit will total 44.2 trillion yen, an
amount in line with the government’s pledge to keep it below
44.3 trillion yen.  The Ministry of Finance will enlarge each monthly auction
of debt maturing in 10 and 20 years by 100 billion yen from the
original plan for this year.  The government in November started to sell an extra 100
billion yen of two- and five-year debt at each auction of the
securities, after Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  approved a 12.1
trillion yen third supplementary budget to fund earthquake
reconstruction. It currently sells 2.7 trillion yen in two-year
notes and 2.5 trillion yen in five-year notes every month.       Total Amount:             *149.7 tln yen  *The figure is the actual amount that the government plans to
sell to investors through auctions between April 1, 2012, and
March 31, 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
