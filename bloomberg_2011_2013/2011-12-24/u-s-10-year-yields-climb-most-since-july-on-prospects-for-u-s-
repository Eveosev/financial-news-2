Treasury  10-year notes dropped,
pushing yields up the most in almost six months, as data showed
the  U.S. economy  is strengthening and the  European Central Bank 
moved to keep credit flowing amid the euro area’s debt crisis.  Yields on 30-year bonds had the biggest weekly gain since
October as claims for jobless benefits in the U.S. unexpectedly
fell and orders for durable goods climbed. Consumer confidence
jumped this month the most since July, data next week may show.  “There’s a bias for optimism,” said  Jim Vogel , an
interest-rate strategist in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , at FTN
Financial. “Sentiment is always looking for better data; that’s
the way the market is thinking right now. With a period of
stability in  Europe , you have time to think. We’ll look at the
road forward.”  Ten-year note  yields rose 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, to 2.02 percent yesterday in  New York , from
1.85 percent on Dec. 16, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. It was the  biggest increase  since yields on the
benchmark note advanced 32 basis points in the five days ended
July 1. The 2 percent securities due in November 2021 dropped 1
19/32, or $15.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 25/32.  Yields on  30-year bonds  increased 21 basis points to 3.06
percent, the most since the week ended Oct. 14. Two-year note
yields increased six basis points to 0.28 percent.  Yield Curve  The gap between yields on two- and 30-year securities,
known as the  yield curve , widened yesterday to 277 basis points,
the most since Dec. 13. The 2011 low was 249 basis points on
Oct. 3, and the average for the year is 348 basis points.  The increase in 30-year yields this week pared their drop
for 2011 to 127 basis points, which still would be the biggest
annual reduction since 2008. Long bonds have returned 33 percent
in 2011, more than triple the 9.3 percent gain in the broader
Treasury market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.  Yields  on 10-year debt have also fallen 127 basis points in
2011, the most in three years. They touched a record low 1.67
percent in September. The benchmark notes have returned 16.3
percent, according to a Bank of American Merrill Lynch index.  Treasuries slipped Dec. 21 as the ECB said it would lend
euro-area banks more than economists forecast in three-year
loans to restore confidence in sovereign borrowers.  The central bank awarded 489 billion euros ($645 billion)
in its longer-term refinancing operation, the most ever in a
single operation and more than the median estimate of 293
billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey.  Leaders Struggle  Longer-term Treasury yields still were below their averages
for the year, and the U.S. drew strong demand as it sold a
record amount of notes, bonds and inflation-linked debt over the
past two weeks, as European leaders struggle to resolve the debt
crisis. Ten-year yields averaged 2.78 percent this year, and 30-
year yields averaged 3.92 percent.  Two-year U.S. interest-rate swap spreads, a measure of
stress in credit markets, jumped to 51.6 basis points yesterday,
the widest level since Nov. 29, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Italian 10-year  government bonds  fell yesterday,
pushing yields briefly beyond the 7 percent level that led
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to request international bailouts.  “There are still concerns about Europe, even though the
ECB tempered it,” said James Combias, New York-based head of
Treasury trading at Mizuho Securities USA Inc., one of the 21
primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve .  Durable Goods  Ten-year note yields rose yesterday to the highest level in
more than a week after the Commerce Department said bookings for
U.S.  durable goods  rose 3.8 percent in November. A separate
report showed sales of new homes in the U.S. rose to a seven-
month high.  A day earlier, Labor Department data showed initial jobless
claims fell by 4,000 to 364,000 last week, versus a forecast in
a Bloomberg survey for an increase to 380,000.  “People are still optimistic about the broader economy,”
said Carl J. Riccadonna, economist in New York at the primary
dealer Deutsche Bank AG. “There’s evidence of positive feedback
that will hopefully intensify in the next year.”  The Conference Board’s index of  consumer confidence 
increased to 58.6 in December, the most in five months,
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast before the New York-
based private research group releases the data on Dec. 27.  Treasury Auctions  The U.S. sold $99 billion in  Treasury securities  this week,
in the final of seven offerings of $177 billion of notes, bonds
and inflation-indexed debt over the past two weeks, the most
ever for that amount of time.  The Treasury drew record low yields of 0.88 percent at a
five-year note auction on Dec. 20, negative 0.88 percent at a
five-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities offering on
Dec. 15, and 2.93 percent at a sale of 30-year bonds on Dec. 14.
It drew stronger-than-average demand at auctions of two-, three-
and 10-year debt.  The Fed  sold  $16.74 billion this week of securities due
from 2013 to 2014, while purchasing $12.03 billion of debt due
from 2017 to 2041. The central bank is replacing $400 billion of
short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries
through June to lower borrowing costs further and boost growth.  Treasury-market volume slid this week as the Christmas
holiday approached. About $89 billion of Treasuries  changed
hands  yesterday through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
interdealer broker, as of 2:01 p.m. New York time. The 2011
full-day average is $288 billion. Trading  ended  yesterday at 2
p.m., and markets will be closed Dec. 26 in observance of the
holiday, under recommendations from the Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
