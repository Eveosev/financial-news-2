Protesters opposing the expansion of
a power plant in Haimen town near  Shantou  city in southern  China 
dispersed after the local government assured suspension of work
on the project, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The campaigners dispersed about 6 p.m. yesterday after the
government also said it would release detained villagers, Xinhua
said, without citing anyone. A party official from Shantou
promised that the project would be permanently shelved,  Hong
Kong ’s Sing Tao Daily reported today, citing eyewitnesses.  Protests began early this week when about 500 people from
Haimen blocked a highway to oppose the plant, which they say is
hurting people’s health and killing fish. Separately, officials
in nearby  Guangdong province  reached agreement this week to end
a two-week protest over a land dispute by villagers in Wukan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
