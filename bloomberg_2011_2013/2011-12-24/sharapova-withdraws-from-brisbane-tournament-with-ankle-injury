Maria Sharapova  withdrew from next
month’s Brisbane International tennis tornament because of an
ankle injury, organizers said.  The three-time Grand Slam winner was to play in the
tournament for the first time in preparation for the Australian
Open, which begins Jan. 16.  “Unfortunately my ankle is not 100 percent and I won’t be
able to make it this year,” Sharapova, fourth in the WTA Tour
world rankings, said on the tournament’s website. “I do expect
to be ready for the year’s first Grand Slam and I am really
looking foward to competing on court.  Sharapova, 24, won her last Grand Slam title at the
Australian Open in 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
