Iran’s navy started a 10-day
exercise east of the Strait of Hormuz, covering an area that
extends as far as the  Indian Ocean ,  Press TV  reported.  Iran’s navy will use its latest equipment, including
submarines, ground-to-sea missile systems and torpedoes, the
Tehran-based broadcaster reported. The strait will not be closed
during the drill, Press TV cited Navy Commander Habibollah
Sayari as saying.  About 15.5 million barrels of oil a day, or a sixth of
global consumption, flows through the waterway between Iran and
Oman at the mouth of the  Persian Gulf , according to the U.S.
