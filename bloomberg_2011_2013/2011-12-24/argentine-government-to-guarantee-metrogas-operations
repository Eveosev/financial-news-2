BG Group Plc’s  local unit Metrogas
SA’s operations will be “guaranteed” by the Argentine
government, federal planning minister Julio De Vido said in a
 statement  today.  The statement came one day after  YPF SA (YPFD) ,  Argentina ’s
largest energy company, said it won’t exercise an option to buy
shares of Gas Argentino SA, Metrogas’s holding company, and
Metroenergia SA from BG Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
