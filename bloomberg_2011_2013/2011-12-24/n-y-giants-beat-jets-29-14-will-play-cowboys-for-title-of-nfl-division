The  New York Giants  defeated the New
York Jets 29-14, setting up a season finale against the  Dallas
Cowboys  on Jan. 1 to decide the division title and which team
makes the National Football League playoffs.  Victor Cruz scored on a team-record 99-yard scoring pass
from Eli Manning for the Giants, who improved to 8-7 with their
second win in the past seven games. Manning and Cruz join New
England’s Tom Brady and Wes Welker for the second 99-yard
touchdown pass this season to set an NFL record.  The Giants are now tied for first place in the National
Football Conference’s East division with the Dallas Cowboys, who
lost 20-7 at home to the  Philadelphia Eagles . The Giants’ win
eliminated the Eagles (7-8) from playoff contention.  “It wasn’t the prettiest game offensively that we’ve ever
played, but we didn’t make many mistakes,” Manning, who was 9-
for-27 passing, said in a news conference. “We didn’t force
things and put ourselves in harm’s way.”  The Jets fell to 8-7 with their second loss in a row and
are one game behind the  Cincinnati Bengals  for the final wild-
card playoff berth in the American Football Conference. The
Bengals defeated the Arizona Cardinals 23-16 yesterday.  The Tennessee Titans and Oakland Raiders both won, tying
the Jets with 8-7 records. The Titans won 23-17 at home against
the Jacksonville Jaguars.  Raiders Win in Overtime  The Raiders won 16-13 in overtime at the Kansas City Chiefs
on a 36-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski, tying the
Denver Broncos atop the AFC West division. Denver (8-7) lost 40-
14 at Buffalo as Tim Tebow was intercepted four times. The
Detroit Lions (10-5) secured their first playoff berth since
1999 with a 38-10 victory at home against the San Diego Chargers.
The San Francisco 49ers (12-3), who already have clinched the
NFC West, won 19-17 at Seattle.  The  New England  Patriots (12-3) rallied from a 17-point
halftime deficit to defeat the Miami Dolphins 27-24 to clinch a
first-round playoff bye and maintain the best record in the AFC.
They have a one-game lead for the conference’s top playoff seed
over the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers.  The Patriots’ rally marked the 10th time this season a team
has come back from at least 17 points down to win, the most in a
single-season in the NFL.  Ravens, Steelers Tie  The Ravens and Steelers remain tied atop the AFC North with
11-4 records. Baltimore won 20-14 against the Cleveland Browns
and Pittsburgh defeated the St. Louis Rams 27-0.  Cam Newton threw for 171 yards to set an NFL rookie passing
record and lead the  Carolina Panthers  to a 48-16 win against the
 Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Newton, who threw for three touchdowns and
also scored on a 49-yard run, now has 3,893 yards passing this
season to break the record of 3,739 set in 1998 by Peyton Manning.  The  Minnesota Vikings  lost running back Adrian Peterson to
a left knee injury while winning 33-26 against the  Washington
Redskins .  The Giants have now won five straight games against the
Jets dating back to 1996. The Giants are seeking to return to
the NFL postseason for the first time since the 2008 season,
having missed the playoffs the past two years.  The victory also gives them bragging rights over their New
York-area rivals and an 8-4 lead in the series all-time. The
teams share MetLife Stadium in  East Rutherford ,  New Jersey ,
where the Giants were considered the visiting team yesterday and
were 3-point underdogs, according to Las Vegas oddsmakers.  Mark Sanchez was 30-of-59 passing for 258 yards and two
interceptions for the Jets, who haven’t beaten the Giants in a
regular-season game since 1993.  ‘Better Today’  “They were the better team today, and they’re the better
team this year,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said in a news conference.  With yesterday’s loss, the Jets will have to beat Miami in
their Jan. 1 season finale to have a chance to make the playoffs
for a third straight year under Ryan. The Jets fell a win short
of the  Super Bowl  the past two seasons, losing in the AFC title
game.  To contact the reporters on this story:
