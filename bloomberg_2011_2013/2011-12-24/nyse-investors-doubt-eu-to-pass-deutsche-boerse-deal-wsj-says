Some  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  shareholders
doubt that  Deutsche Boerse AG’s  proposed takeover will be
approved by European Union antitrust authorities, the Wall
Street Journal said.  “The smoke signals are reasonably obvious at this point
that this deal will not happen,” the newspaper cited Brian Barish, chief investment officer of Cambiar Investors LLC, as
saying. Cambiar is the 10th-largest holder of NYSE Euronext
shares with a 1.6 percent stake, the Journal said.  The European sovereign debt crisis, a possible tax on some
trading and concessions already made by the exchanges to get
approval have contributed to making the deal less attractive
than it was when first approved by shareholders in July, the
newspaper said, citing some investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
