Boston Celtics forward  Paul Pierce 
missed practice yesterday because of a right heel injury and is
doubtful for tomorrow’s National Basketball Association season
opener at the New York Knicks.  Pierce, 34, a nine-time All-Star, missed both of the
Celtics’ preseason games and most of training camp with the heel
problem. Coach Doc Rivers said Pierce remains doubtful for the
opener at Madison Square Garden.  “It’d be very unlikely he’ll start if he plays,” Rivers
said yesterday after practice. “If he does play, he’ll play 15-
20 minutes, but right now I don’t see him going.”  Pierce led the Celtics in scoring last season by averaging
18.9 points per game. Rivers said Sasha Pavlovic, 28, probably
will start in Pierce’s place.  The Celtics already are short-handed at the small forward
position because  Jeff Green  is sidelined for the entire season
due to a heart condition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
