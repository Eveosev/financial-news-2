Publicis Groupe SA (PUB)  will seek
“targeted, precise” acquisitions in  Germany , probably from
mid-2012,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said, citing an interview with
Chief Executive Officer  Maurice Levy .  Germany was a “problem child” for the group until recently,
and still has a long way to go, Levy told the newspaper. Sales
in Germany this year will increase by about 11 percent,
Sueddeutsche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
