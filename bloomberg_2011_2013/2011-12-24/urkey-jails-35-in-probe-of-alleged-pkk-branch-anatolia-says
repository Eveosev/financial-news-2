Turkey  jailed 35 of the 48 people
who were detained Dec. 20 in an operation that targeted 10 news
organizations amid a probe of the alleged urban arm of the
Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party, or PKK, Anatolia reported.  After interrogations, prosecutors freed seven people,
including Agence France-Presse photographer Mustafa Ozer, and
referred 41 to a criminal court in Istanbul, according to state-
owned Anatolia. The court freed another six people, the  news
agency  said.  The people are suspected of running the media arm of the
ideology unit of the Union of Communities in Kurdistan, or KCK.
The government says KCK is the the urban branch of the PKK,
which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S.
and the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
