Blackburn wants Fulham striker  Andy
Johnson  to help the club avoid relegation from the Premier
League, the Daily Mirror says.  Rovers are willing to pay Fulham’s 2 million-pound ($3
million) asking price and offer Johnson a 50,000 pounds-per-week
salary, as well as a bonus if the team remains in the Premier
League, the Mirror said.  Johnson heads a list of “survival targets” last-place
Blackburn has drawn up to help stay in the top flight, the
newspaper said. The 30-year-old is open to leaving Fulham, but
would prefer to say in  London .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
