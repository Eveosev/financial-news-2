Turkey  passed a measure to increase
the monthly pension payments for lawmakers by as much as 2.6
times to 7,700 liras ($4,050), Hurriyet  reported .  The measure, approved by the national assembly in Ankara,
equalized retirement paychecks for all deputies, which
previously ranged from 3,000 liras to 5,000 liras, the newspaper
said. Retired lawmakers will be eligible for monthly payments
equal to 60 percent of the president’s retirement package until
the end of 2020, according to the report.  Lawmakers who are eligible for retirement will now be paid
19,700 liras a month, while deputies will get 12,000, Hurriyet
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
