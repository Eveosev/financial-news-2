Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said oil that
leaked from its 200,000 barrel-a-day Bonga field in  Nigeria 
“continues to thin.”  “Surveillance and aerial photos show the spill is breaking
up into patches surrounded by clear water,” Shell said in a
statement on its website.  “The spill remains offshore. We
continue to monitor its movement using satellite imagery and
vessels in the zone.”   Bonga, located 75 miles off Nigeria’s coastline, pumps
about 10 percent of the West African nation’s oil.  Shell,  Europe ’s largest oil company, said Dec. 22 as much
as half of the crude that leaked from the Bonga installation has
dissipated through natural dispersion and evaporation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
