Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  signed an
agreement to buy an extra 25,000 tons of diesel a month from
Kuwait Petroleum Corp. in 2012, O Globo said, citing two
unidentified people close to the deal.  The volume will be added to an existing contract to buy
40,000 tons of diesel a month from KPC from mid-2011 to the end
of 2012, the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
