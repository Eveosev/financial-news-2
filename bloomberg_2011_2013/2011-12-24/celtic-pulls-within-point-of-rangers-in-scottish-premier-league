Celtic beat Kilmarnock 2-1 to pull
within a point of Scottish Premier League leader Rangers, which
lost 2-1 at St. Mirren.  Georgios Samaras scored both goals as Celtic won its eighth
straight league match. Aaron Mooy and Paul McGowan scored in St.
Mirren’s home win over Rangers, which had Lee McCulloch and
