The World Cup ski event scheduled
for Munich on New Year’s Day has been canceled by poor weather
conditions.  Races on both the men’s and women’s circuits were called
off because of a “lack of snow, too warm temperatures, rain and
no positive weather forecast,” the Internatioal Ski Federation
said on is website.  The event will not be replaced in the season schedule, the
FIS said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
