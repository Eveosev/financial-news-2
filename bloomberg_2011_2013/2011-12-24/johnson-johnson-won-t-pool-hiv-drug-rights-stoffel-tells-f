Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  rejected requests
to offer patent rights on its HIV medicines to generic drug
companies through a pool system over concern it could increase
resistance to the drugs, the Financial Times said, citing an
interview with head of pharmaceuticals, Paul Stoffel.  “We want the right therapy at the right time,” Stoffel
told the newspaper. “We will not get there by leasing our
intellectual property to all companies, throwing our drugs on
the market without any guidance or control. That would cause a
huge disaster.”  Abbott Laboratories and  Merck & Co. (MRK)  have also refused to
enter discussions with the Medicines Patent Pool, which is
backed by government donors and aims to boost research and
access to HIV treatments in poor countries, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
