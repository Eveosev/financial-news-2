Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
said he will leave for the U.S. to let an interim government
prepare for an election to replace him.  Saleh said at the presidential palace that he’ll leave “in
the coming few days” and return to Yemen to represent the
opposition. A U.S. State Department spokesman had no immediate
comment on Saleh’s plans.  Saleh, who wasn’t more specific about date of his travel,
also said he was in good health.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
