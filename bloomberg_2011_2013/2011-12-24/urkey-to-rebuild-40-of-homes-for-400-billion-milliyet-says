Turkey  plans to rebuild 40 percent
of the country’s 19 million residential homes in a 20-year
project that will cost $400 billion, Environment and Urban
Planning Minister Erdogan Bayraktar said, Milliyet reported.  The government brought X-ray machines from  Germany  to scan
all housing units in the country free of charge to determine
whether they are structurally sound following the Oct. 23
earthquake in the eastern province of Van, where more than 600
people died in Turkey’s worst temblor since 1999, Bayraktar  told 
reporters in Istanbul, according to the newspaper.  A bill expected to be approved at the Ankara parliament in
January would give building owners four months to tear down
sites that the state determines to be at risk and the government
will do the demolition if landlords fail to act within that
period, Bayraktar was cited by Milliyet as saying.  Landlords won’t be able sue to prevent demolition,
Bayraktar said, according to the newspaper. Stakeholders in a
building will have to choose to unanimously agree to rebuild,
sell their shares to a majority that has support from two-thirds
of owners or, failing both, turn over the property at a state-
determined fair-value price to the government, which will give
the land to the Housing Development Administration of Turkey for
rebuilding.  Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said three days
after the Van earthquake that the government would introduce a
bill to tear down structurally unsound buildings, illegal
housing and squatter homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
