Russian billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , who plans to challenge Vladimir Putin in next year’s
presidential election, will attend an opposition meeting in
Moscow today, his press office said by telephone today.  About 50,000 people, including ex-Soviet President  Mikhail Gorbachev  and former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, plan to
gather on Sakharov Prospect in the center of Moscow today to
campaign against alleged violations during parliamentary
elections, according to Echo of Moscow radio.  Prokhorov may speak at the meeting if well perceived by the
protesters, his press office told Bloomberg News.  Prokhorov is a billionaire investor in Polyus Gold
International Ltd., Russia’s largest gold miner, and United Co.
Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
