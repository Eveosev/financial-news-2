Vale SA (VALE3)  plans to sell all its oil
and gas assets to concentrate on its core mining business, Folha
de S. Paulo said, without saying where it got the information.  Vale is a minority stakeholder in 18 blocks in the Santos,
Espirito Santo, Para-Maranhao and Parnaiba Basins, many of which
it shares with Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the newspaper reported.  Almost all Petrobras contracts contain a clause giving it a
right of first refusal on blocks being sold, Folha said, citing
an unidentified person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
