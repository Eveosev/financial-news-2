Volkswagen AG’s  internal sales
target for 2012 may be too high due to weakness in southern
European markets, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported,
citing the head of the works council Bernd Osterloh.  Sales won’t fall or stagnate, Osterloh told the newspaper.
He said the worst case scenario would be if sales remain at the
same level as in 2011, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
