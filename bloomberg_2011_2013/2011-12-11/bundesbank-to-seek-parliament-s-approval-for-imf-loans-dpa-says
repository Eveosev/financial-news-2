Germany ’s Bundesbank will seek
approval from parliament before authorizing as much as an
additional 45 billion euros ($60.2 billion) in loans to the
International Monetary Fund to assist the euro area bailout, DPA
reported, citing an interview with board member Andreas Dombret.  “It’s important to us as an exception in this specific
case that the Bundestag share the responsibility for the
additional IMF credit line and confirm to the Bundesbank that we
are not in conflict with previous parliamentary decisions on
limiting risk,” the  news agency  cited Dombret as saying today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
