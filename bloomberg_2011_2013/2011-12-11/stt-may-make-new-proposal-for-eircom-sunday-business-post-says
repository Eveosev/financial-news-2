Singapore Technologies Telemedia
Pte. will probably make a new offer to invest in Eircom Group
Ltd., Ireland’s largest phone company, the Sunday Business Post
 reported  without saying where it got the information.  STT, Eircom’s largest investor, may propose in the next few
weeks that first-lien lenders take a writedown steeper than the
7.5 percent that the creditors have suggested as part of a debt-
for-equity swap, the newspaper said.  STT said Dec. 2 that it was continuing to evaluate its
investment position in Eircom after missing a deadline to submit
a plan. Eircom said the same day it had received two
restructuring proposals from lenders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
