GAIL ( India ) Ltd. agreed to buy 3.5
million metric tons of liquefied natural gas a year from
 Cheniere Energy Partners LP (CQP)  for two decades.  The LNG deliveries are expected to start in 2017 from
Houston-based Cheniere’s Sabine Pass LNG terminal in western
Cameron Parish, Louisiana, the companies said today in a
statement distributed by PR Newswire. They have an option to
extend the agreement by 10 years.  Natural-gas producers in  North America  are expanding into
new markets with LNG, super-chilled for shipping by tanker.
Encana Corp., Canada’s largest gas producer, and Apache Corp.
are proposing an LNG facility in Kitimat, British Columbia, to
ship the fuel to Asia.  B.C. Tripathi, chairman of New Delhi-based GAIL, said in
the statement that the accord will help the company to “ensure
long-term gas supply for the growing demand in the Indian
markets.’  The LNG price will be linked to a benchmark U.S. price and
included a fixed component, the companies said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
