Greencore Group Plc (GNC) â€™s purchase of
British food company Uniq Plc may benefit shareholders by as
much as 50 million pounds ($78 million) over time, the Sunday
Business Post  said , citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Patrick Coveney.  Tax losses at Uniq, which Dublin-based Greencore acquired
in September, may mean the Irish food company will pay minimal
tax on its main earnings for five to 10 years, the newspaper
said, citing Coveney.  To contact the reporters on this story:
