Iran  has discovered a natural-gas
field in the  Caspian Sea , the Ministry of Petroleum’s news
website Shana  reported , citing Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi.  The field, in waters 700 meters (2,300 feet) deep, lies
wholly within Iranian territory, Qasemi said, without specifying
the location or estimating the amount of gas contained there,
according to Shana. Iran has 11 trillion cubic meters of proven
gas reserves in the Caspian Sea, excluding this latest
discovery, the minister said.  Iran holds the world’s second-largest gas reserves, with
29.6 trillion cubic meters, according to the BP Statistical
Review of World Energy in June. Russia has the biggest reserves
of the fuel, BP data show.  Iran’s government is struggling to attract foreign
investment to help develop its gas and oil resources amid
international economic sanctions. The U.S.,  United Nations  and
European Union have imposed sanctions to try to deter Iran from
developing technology for nuclear weapons. The government says
it want nuclear power for civilian purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
