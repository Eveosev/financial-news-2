Monetary union between four Gulf
Cooperation Council countries will deprive their central banks
of independence and the policy tools needed to control economic
turbulence, Qatar’s central bank Governor  Sheikh Abdullah  bin Saud Al Thani told the state-run Qatar News Agency.  The union, planned since 2001, will not allow member states
to use exchange rates to rectify the trade balances between
them, he said in an  interview  yesterday.  Sheikh Abdullah highlighted the European Union’s “latest
experience that proposes that fiscally stronger countries rescue
less strong countries in times of crisis,” the Qatar News
Agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
