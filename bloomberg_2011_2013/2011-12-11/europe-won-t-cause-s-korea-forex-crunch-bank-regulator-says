Repayment calls from  Europe  probably
won’t cause a currency-exchange crunch among South Korean banks
because the lenders already have secured enough foreign-asset
liquidity, the Asian country’s financial regulator said.  Foreign-currency cash liquidity at local banks gained
fivefold at the end of October compared with the level at the
end of June,  South Korea ’s Financial Supervisory Service said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Borrowing, including loans and bonds from European
countries, totaled $43.6 billion at the end of October,
accounting for 34 percent of overseas borrowing, the regulator
said. That compares with $42 billion at the end of June, when
Europe accounted for 36 percent of overseas borrowing, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
