Socialist Party challenger  Francois Hollande  leads President  Nicolas Sarkozy  by 14 percentage
points, according to a poll by LH2.  Hollande would defeat Sarkozy 57 percent to 43 percent if
the second round of next year’s elections were held now, the
poll said. Hollande lost 1 percentage point and Sarkozy gained
one point since the previous LH2 poll in late November. Hollande
led 60-40 percent in a LH2 poll in October.  In the first round of the election, Hollande would take
31.5 percent, Sarkozy 26 percent, and anti-immigrant campaigner
Marine le Pen 13.5 percent. Under the French system, a run-off
will be held May 6 if no one gets a majority in the April 22
first round.  According to the poll, 55 percent of Le Pen voters would
opt for Sarkozy in the second round and 45 percent for Hollande.  Fifty-five percent said that  France  losing its top  credit
rating  would hurt Sarkozy’s re-election campaign and 36 percent
said it would have no effect. Eighty-one percent said ratings
companies have too much power over government policy.  The poll was commissioned by Yahoo! Inc., the U.S. Internet
company. It involved 953 people questioned Dec. 9 and 10, and
the margin of error was 2.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
