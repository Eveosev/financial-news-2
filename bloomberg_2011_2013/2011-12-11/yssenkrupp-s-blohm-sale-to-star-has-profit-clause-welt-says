ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  agreed this weekend
to sell its  Blohm + Voss GmbH  shipbuilding unit to Star Capital
Partners Ltd. for 30 million euros ($40 million) in cash plus a
share in earnings expected to reach about 40 million euros,  Die
Welt  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The disposal to the U.K. private-equity firm will also
allow  Germany ’s ThyssenKrupp to remove 30 million euros in
under-utilization costs from its books, the newspaper said in an
e-mailed preview of an article to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
