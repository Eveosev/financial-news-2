New Zealand ’s Maori party gave re-
elected Prime Minister John Key its general support for his
National party-led government while saying it would back
legislation on a case-by-case basis.  The  agreement  will help “ensure a strong, stable”
government led by the National party over the next three years,
Key said in an e-mailed statement today.  The National party secured a 47 percent share of the public
vote after a  final election count  yesterday that gave it 59
seats in the next parliament. Key reached agreements with the
single-seat parties ACT and United Future last week to ensure he
has control of the 121-seat parliament.  Those two allies have said they will back Key’s policies on
asset sales and welfare reform and will vote in favor of the
budget. The Maori party, which holds three seats in parliament,
has opposed the asset-sales plan.  “On everything else besides confidence and supply, the
Maori Party will decide support or not on a case-by-case
basis,” Key said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
