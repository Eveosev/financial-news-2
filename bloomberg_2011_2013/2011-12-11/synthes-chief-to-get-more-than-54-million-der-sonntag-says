Michel Orsinger, chief executive
officer of  Synthes Inc. (SYST) , the medical-device maker that’s agreed
to be acquired by  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , will get payments of more
than $54 million from both companies,  Der Sonntag  reported.  According to Orsinger’s new work contract with J&J, he will
get $17.2 million in shares that he has to hold for three years
and $500,000 in cash, the newspaper reported, citing documents
released by the U.S. markets regulator. The manager, whose new
annual salary will be $700,000, will also receive a one-time
payment equal to three times his 2011 salary and bonus, it said.
Synthes will also pay him a loyalty bonus of $36.3 million in
cash, shares and tax refunds, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
