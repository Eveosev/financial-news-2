College sports’ governing body won’t
take further action after a brawl between men’s basketball
players at the University of Cincinnati and No. 8  Xavier
University  resulted in eight suspensions by the schools.  The game on Dec. 10 was stopped with 9.4 seconds remaining
after a shouting match between Xavier’s Tu Holloway and
Cincinnati’s Ge’Lawn Guyn escalated into a brawl when Xavier’s
Dezmine Wells pushed Guyn.  “The incident at the end of the Xavier-Cincinnati
basketball game is deplorable,” National Collegiate Athletic
Association President Mark Emmert said in a statement over the
weekend. “Those involved with that incident today failed to
honor themselves, their schools, and college basketball. It
cannot be tolerated.”  NCAA spokesman Erik Christianson said today in an e-mail
that Emmert’s posting “is our public statement” on the fight.
He had been asked if the association planned any further action.  Cincinnati  suspended senior Yancy Gates, junior Cheikh
Mbodj and freshman Octavius Ellis for six games, and freshman
Guyn for one game.  Xavier  suspended freshman Wells and walk-on Landen Amos for
four games, junior guard Mark Lyons two games and senior guard
Holloway one game.  Xavier was leading 76-53 at the Cintas Center in
Cincinnati. Game officials amended the box score, ejecting
Gates, Mbodj and Wells for fighting. Under NCAA rules, they have
to sit out the next game -- Dec. 14 at Wright State for
Cincinnati and Oral Roberts on Dec. 18 for Xavier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
