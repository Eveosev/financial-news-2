Norwegian Air Shuttle AS (NAS)  is
reconsidering the listing of a long-haul unit on the Oslo and
Stockholm stock exchanges after delays to its launch, Chief
Executive Officer Bjoern Kjos told  Dagens Industri .  The commencement of flights on long-haul routes to  Thailand 
and the U.S. will be delayed until at least the first quarter
2013, the Stockholm-based newspaper reported.  Norwegian may
decide to operate the unit as a wholly owned subsidiary, Kjos
told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
