Areva SA (CEI) , a French nuclear company,
will report “large losses” when it unveils its new strategy,
Industry Minister Eric Besson said.  “I can confirm Areva will report losses and it seems they
will be large,” Besson said in an interview with the Radio J
broadcaster. The “exact amount” of the losses is for the Areva
Chief Executive Officer Luc Oursel to announce, he added.  Areva spokeswoman Patricia Marie declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News yesterday on earlier reports of
Areva losses. Oursel will present the company’s strategy on Dec.
13.  Besson’s comments were confirmed by his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
