Hungarian lawmakers must start
discussing the budget accord agreed by European leaders in
Brussels this week, state-run  MTI  news service reported late
yesterday, citing Prime Minister  Viktor Orban .  The pact, designed to tighten budget discipline in the
European Union, limits national sovereignty and the power of the
country’s lawmakers, which Orban can’t sign without parliament’s
consent, MTI said, citing an interview with the premier to be
aired in full on the state-run M1 channel today.  Orban said he can assert with “complete confidence” that
 Hungary  will be able to stand on its own feet even in the
European crisis, MTI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
