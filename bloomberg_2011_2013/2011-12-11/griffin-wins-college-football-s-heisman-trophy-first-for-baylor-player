Quarterback Robert Griffin III
became the first player from Baylor University to win the
Heisman Trophy, college football’s top individual honor.  Griffin received 1,687 points, beating by 280 points
Stanford quarter Andrew Luck, who finished as runner-up to 2010
winner Cam Newton.  University of Alabama  running back Trent
Richardson was third with 978 points.  The balloting was conducted by the Heisman Trophy Trust and
the winner announced last night at a televised ceremony in New
York.  “This moment right here is unbelievably believable,” said
Griffin, who had earlier shown off his blue Superman socks that
had red capes draping off the cuffs. “It’s unbelievable because
we’re all amazed when great things happen. It’s believable
because great things only happen with hard work.”  Griffin, a 21-year-old junior at the Waco, Texas-based
university, finished the season as the nation’s top-rated
quarterback, completing 72.3 percent of his passes for 3,998
yards and 36 touchdowns, with six interceptions. He also rushed
for 832 yards and nine scores as Baylor went 9-3 -- its best
season in 25 years -- and had a winning record against Big 12
Conference opponents for the first time.  RG3  Griffin, nicknamed RG3, is the third Heisman winner in 14
years to play for a team that lost more than two regular-season
games, joining  Tim Tebow  of  Florida  in 2007 and  Ricky Williams 
of  Texas  in 1998.  Baylor is 12th in the Bowl Championship Series standings
and had a 6-3 record in the Big 12 this season, with wins
against No. 14  Oklahoma , No. 18 Texas Christian and No. 24 Texas.
Before this year, the Bears had an 18-102 record against
conference opponents since joining the Big 12 in 1996.  In the Bears’ final regular-season game, a 48-24 win over
Texas, Griffin passed for 320 yards and two touchdowns while
running for two more scores.  Baylor will play the  University of Washington  in the Dec.
29 Alamo Bowl, making back-to-back postseason appearances for
the first time since 1991 and 1992.  Griffin received 405 first-place votes. Luck got 247 first-
place votes and Richardson received 138.  University of Wisconsin 
running back Montee Ball was fourth in the voting, followed by
Louisiana State cornerback Tyrann Mathieu.  Of the five schools with finalists, Baylor was the only one
without a previous Heisman Trophy winner. Quarterback Donn Trull
was the Bears’ previous highest finisher, placing fourth in 1963,
when Navy quarterback Roger Staubach won.  The trophy is named in memory of John Heisman, a former
coach who as director of  New York ’s Downtown Athletic Club
helped create the award in 1935. Heisman died from pneumonia
less than a year later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
