Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
will likely have to call a confidence vote to win parliamentary
approval for his emergency economic measures,  Il Messaggero 
 reported , citing Gianfranco Fini, head of the Chamber of
Deputies.  Members of parliament have proposed around 800 amendments
to Monti’s package, making a confidence vote to push through the
norms more likely, the newspaper said. Monti is continuing
discussions with political parties on possible changes and plans
to meet unions later today to try to find an accord, Il
Messaggero said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
