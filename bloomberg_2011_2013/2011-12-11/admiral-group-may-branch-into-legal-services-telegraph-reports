Admiral Group Plc (ADM) , the Cardiff,
England-based motor insurer, may branch into the legal sector as
it faces up to the loss of referral fees, the Telegraph said.  The company may set up its own personal injury law firm or
become a major backer in one after implementation of the Legal
Services Act in October, which widened the provision of legal
work to new sources including retailers, banks and insurers, the
newspaper reported. Plans are at an early stage and several
options are being considered, the Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
