The U.K., which announced the
closure of its Tehran embassy after it was attacked by
protesters, is seeking to assign a European country to represent
its interests, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said.  “All aspects of this request, especially the legal
aspects, need to be examined and  Iran  is reviewing the matter,”
 Ramin Mehmanparast , the foreign ministry spokesman, said in an
interview on state television yesterday.  Iran-U.K. diplomatic ties haven’t been fully severed and
the closure of both embassies is “temporary,” the state-run
 Fars  news agency cited Mehmanparast as saying.  The U.K. ordered Iran’s embassy in  London  shut and expelled
Iranian diplomats from the country on Nov. 30, in a move that
has deepened Iran’s isolation. Iran is at loggerheads with
western countries over its nuclear program, which they accuse of
being a cover to develop atomic weapons. Iranian officials
reject the claim and maintain the program is solely for civilian
needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
