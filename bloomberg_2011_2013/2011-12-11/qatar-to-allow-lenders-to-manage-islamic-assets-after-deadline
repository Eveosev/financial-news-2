Qatari commercial banks may continue
to manage Islamic assets beyond the year-end deadline to close
their Islamic banking arms, the central bank governor said in an
interview with the state-run  Qatar News Agency .  The banks also have the option to transfer the assets to
the country’s Islamic banks, Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud Al Thani
said.  Qatar’s central bank in February told non-Islamic lenders
to stop offering Sharia-compliant services and wind down their
Islamic units by year end on concern they may be using funds
from the conventional bank for Islamic loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
