U.K. Financial Investments Ltd., the
government-funded body that manages the Treasury’s 41 percent
stake in  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , indicated to the bank’s board
that it backs the return of Antonio Horta-Osorio as chief
executive officer, the Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The backing comes ahead of a board meeting on Dec. 15 at
which the board must decide if Horta-Osorio is fit enough to
return, the Telegraph said.  Horta-Osorio is seeking to return to work after taking
medical leave last month, a person with knowledge of the matter
said on Dec. 8. Lloyds’s board is requiring the 47-year-old to
undergo medical examinations to show he’s well enough to return,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
matter is private.  Lloyds spokesman Ed Petter declined to comment, while a
spokesman for UKFI was not immediately available when contacted
by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
