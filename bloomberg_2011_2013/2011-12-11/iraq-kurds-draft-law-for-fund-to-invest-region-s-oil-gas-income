Iraq ’s semi-autonomous  Kurdistan
Regional Government  proposed a draft law to set up a fund to
manage revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas produced in
the region, according to the KRG’s official website.  Kurdish authorities aim to put money into a fund to benefit
“future generations,” and also to invest in regional projects
and possibly into the KRG’s Ministry of Natural Resources to
help develop oil and gas, according to the draft published on
the website. The money will include energy-related payments
received from Iraq’s central government, the statement said
today.  Kurdish authorities and Iraq’s central government have
disagreed for years over contracts the KRG has reached with
foreign energy companies. The government in  Baghdad  refuses to
recognize production-sharing agreements signed by the KRG, as
Iraq’s Oil Ministry agrees only to service contracts that pay
producers a per-barrel fee instead of a share of any crude.  Iraq’s northern Kurdish region contains 45 billion barrels
of oil and 3 trillion to 6 trillion cubic meters of gas, KRG
Natural Resources Minister  Ashti Hawrami  said in September. The
Iraqi government says the country’s total crude reserves are
143.1 billion barrels. The Kurdish region has potential to
export 100,000 barrels of oil a day, according to the KRG. The
region has attracted more than $10 billion in energy
investments, KRG Prime Minister Barham Salih said May 5.  The fund will be run by a six-member board led by a
president with the rank of deputy minister, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
