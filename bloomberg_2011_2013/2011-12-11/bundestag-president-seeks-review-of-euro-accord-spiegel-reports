The euro accord reached in Brussels
last week requires thorough review to ensure it’s
constitutional, Bundestag President Norbert Lammert told  Der
Spiegel  magazine in an interview.  The German parliament will “carefully review potential
constitutional problems that may arise through direct
intervention” by European authorities in national budgets, the
magazine quoted Lammert, a member of the ruling Christian
Democrats and parliament’s most senior lawmaker, as saying
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
