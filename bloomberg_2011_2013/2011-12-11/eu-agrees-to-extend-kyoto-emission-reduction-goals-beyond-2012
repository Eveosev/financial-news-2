The European Union vowed to extend
its emission-reduction goals under the  Kyoto Protocol  beyond
2012 after negotiators at the United Nations talks backed the
bloc’s plan to sketch out a path to a new climate treaty.  The EU decision, to be formally approved by national
governments next year, provides a lifeline for the Kyoto
Protocol, the world’s only treaty with mandatory emission
targets from 2008 to 2012 for industrialized nations. UN envoys
agreed at a summit ended today in Durban,  South Africa , that the
so-called second commitment period would span 2013 to 2017.  The pledge by the 27-nation bloc, which has its own
internally binding target of cutting greenhouse gases by 20
percent in 2020 from 1990 levels, ensures that the Kyoto treaty
won’t become an empty shell after  Russia , Canada and  Japan 
declared they would not adopt new targets. The U.S. has never
ratified the protocol.  “We are going to the second commitment period,” Climate
Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said in Durban today.  The EU decision ensures a bridging mechanism for the period
between the expiration of current goals for developed nations
next year and the entry into force of a new international deal
that envoys agreed to prepare for no later than 2020. It also
helps to allay investors’ concerns that the UN carbon market,
which shrank to $1.5 billion last year from $7.4 billion in
2007, may lose its legal basis.  The UN decision today set the deadline for countries to
submit their second set of Kyoto commitments before May 1, 2012.  The extension of the Kyoto targets by developed countries
was a key demand from poorer nations, including  India ,  China  and
Brazil, which have voluntary goals under the protocol and argued
they need more time for a shift to mandatory commitments that
would impact their economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
