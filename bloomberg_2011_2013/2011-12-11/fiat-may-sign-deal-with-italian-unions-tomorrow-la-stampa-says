Fiat SpA (F)  will likely sign a
collective contract with representatives of its Italian workers
tomorrow,  La Stampa  reported, citing union leaders.  While Fiat has reached agreement on issues including a 10
percent pay increase for overtime and greater “harmonization” of
contracts across Italian plants, there are still points to iron
out, the paper said, citing the Fismic union’s Vincenzo Aragona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
