A magnitude 6.5 earthquake centered
in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero shook the capital of
 Latin America ’s second-biggest economy. Two people were killed
in Guerrero, the country’s civil protection agency said.  The quake occurred at 7:47 p.m. local time and was centered
166 kilometers (103 miles) southwest of Mexico City, according
to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  “All services in Mexico City are functioning normally,”
Mexican President Felipe Calderon said via the Twitter website
at approximately 10 p.m. An 18-year old was killed in Iguala,
Guerrero, when a restaurant roof collapsed, and a 25-year old
was killed on the Chilpancingo-Acapulco highway, the civil
protection agency said in an e-mailed statement.  Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-controlled  oil company 
known as Pemex, said its infrastructure wasn’t damaged. Mexico
City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said on Twitter that the capital’s
airport, subway and the water systems are functioning normally.  The temblor left 30 neighborhoods in Mexico City without
power, the Excelsior newspaper reported, citing the federal
electricity commission. Police chief Manuel Mondragon y Kalb
said in an interview with Foro TV two buildings in the city were
reported to be damaged, including one that was leaning on
another structure. He confirmed power outages in some parts of
the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
