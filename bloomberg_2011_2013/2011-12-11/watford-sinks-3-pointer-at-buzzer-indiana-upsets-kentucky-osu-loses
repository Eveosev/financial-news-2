Christian Watford hit a 3-pointer at
the final buzzer as undefeated  Indiana University  upset top-
ranked University of Kentucky 73-72 in college basketball. The
University of Kansas topped No. 2  Ohio State University  78-67.  Watford scored 20 points for the Hoosiers, who handed the
Wildcats their first defeat this season. It was the first time
 Indiana  has beaten a top-ranked team since a win over Duke in
the 2002 National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  At Phog Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas, Thomas
Robinson scored 21 points to lead the 13th-ranked Jayhawks past
the Buckeyes. Kansas is 5-0 on its home court this season.  At Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, after Watford’s
throw hit the basket, the referees waited for the results of a
replay to ensure that it counted. Indiana fans, however, surged
onto the court without a final decision.  “I thought it was good, so I would have been like stunned
if it wasn’t,” said coach Tom Crean who waited next to
officials for the final word.  The Hoosiers (9-0) had a 30-29 advantage at halftime. As
the game clock wound down, Marquis Teague scored a layup with 48
seconds left that gave  Kentucky  a 71-70 lead.  ‘It Felt Great’  Doron Lamb, fouled with 5.6 seconds left, missed the first
free throw and made the second to increase the Wildcats’ (8-1)
lead to 72-70.  Watford then hit his 3-pointer, the final of his game-high
points.  “It felt great,” Watford said. “You can’t really tell if
it’s going in. But I got it off, it felt great, it looked like I
got enough rotation on it and it went in.”  Victor Oladipo had 13 points for the Hoosiers, who had five
players scoring at least 10 points.  Lamb led the Wildcats with 19 points, while Michael Kidd-
Gilchrist added 18 and Teague had 15.  Kansas , which took a 35-29 lead at halftime, hit nine of 17
3-point attempts while the Buckeyes were successful on five of
17.  Elijah Johnson added 15 for the Jayhawks (7-2). William
Buford scored 21 and Deshaun Thomas had 19 for the Buckeyes (8-
1).  To contact the reporter on this story:
