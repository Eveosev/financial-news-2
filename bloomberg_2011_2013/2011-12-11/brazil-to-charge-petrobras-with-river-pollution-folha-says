Brazilian police are preparing to
charge state-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  with polluting
the river Iguacu following an oil leak in December 2010, Folha
de S. Paulo reported, citing Police Commissioner Fabio Scliar.  Petrobras denies that there was a leak, saying that the
discharge consisted of treated and licensed effluent, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said, citing the company’s press office.  Petrobras’s press office didn’t immediately respond to
requests for comment on the Folha story.  To contact the reporters on this story:
