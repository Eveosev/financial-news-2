German voters are dissatisfied with
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s leadership during the euro crisis,
according to an Infratest poll conducted for  ARD  television.  Some 55 percent of those surveyed said they were “less
satisfied” or “not satisfied at all” with Merkel’s handling
of the criticism while 65 percent of the respondents said
solidarity with troubled euro member countries is in  Germany ’s
best interest. Last week’s EU accord wouldn’t help stabilize the
euro area, according to 57 percent.  The Infratest poll of 1,000 voters was conducted on Dec.
9-10 and released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
