Japanese  stock (MXAP)   futures  and
Australian stocks rose after European leaders expanded a bailout
fund and tightened anti-deficit rules, boosting investor demand
for riskier assets.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. , a Japanese
exporter of consumer electronics which depends on Europe for 21
percent of its sales, rose 1 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of  Komatsu Ltd. , a maker of construction
machinery that counts China as its biggest market, added 1.4
percent on speculation a shrinking trade surplus may prompt
China to ease monetary policy.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No.
1 mining company and Australia’s biggest oil producer, rose 2.2
percent in Sydney after crude prices rose.  Futures (TPX)  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 8,645 in Chicago on Dec. 9, up from 8,520 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,630 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained
0.5 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added 0.2 percent
in Wellington.  The situation in Europe is “moving in the right direction,
but I think we need to see more out of Europe before we can be
confident,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100
billion under management. “It’s appropriate to increase wagers
a bit, going into a year-end period, which normally sees share
prices move higher.”  ‘Fiscal Compact’  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.2 percent
today. The index rose 1.7 percent in New York on Dec. 9 after
European leaders in Brussels tightened anti-deficit rules and
agreed to boost their rescue fund by as much as 200 billion
euros ($267 billion) by funneling money to the  International
Monetary Fund . They outlined a “fiscal compact” to prevent
future debt run-ups and accelerated the start of a planned 500
billion-euro rescue fund.  Stocks also gained as confidence improved among consumers
in the U.S., the world’s biggest economy. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment rose to 67.7 in December from 64.1 in November,
beating estimates.  In China, customs data released Dec. 10 showed the weakest
export growth since 2009. Overseas shipments  rose 13.8 percent
last month from a year earlier, while the excess of exports over
imports fell by 35 percent.  A smaller  trade surplus  and signs that capital has started
to flow out of the country may encourage the ruling Communist
Party to add to a Nov. 30 cut in bank reserve requirements,
first such move since 2008, according to Shen Jianguang, a Hong
Kong-based economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 16.4 percent this year
through last week, compared with a 0.2 percent drop by the  S&P
500  and a 12.8 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.7 times for the S&P 500
and 10.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for January delivery rose $1.07 to settle at
$99.41 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
biggest gain since Nov. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
