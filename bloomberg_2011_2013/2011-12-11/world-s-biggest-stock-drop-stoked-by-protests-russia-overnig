Protests against Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  are compounding concerns over weaker oil and
slower global growth that sent Russia’s  RTS index  to drop the
most in the world last week and spur speculation that more
declines are likely.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell 1.1 percent to $27.57 on Dec. 9,
bringing its decline in the week to 9 percent, the most since
September. Fixed-line phone operator  OAO Rostelecom (ROSYY)  dropped to
the lowest level since Oct. 20 in U.S. trading after HSBC
Holdings Plc cut its share-price target, while OAO Gazprom,
Russia’s biggest company, slid more than 9 percent.  As  oil prices  fell last week and concern mounted that the
debt crisis in  Europe  would crimp energy demand, anger over the
Dec. 4 parliamentary elections sent at least 25,000 people into
the streets of Moscow on Dec. 10, the biggest demonstration in
Putin’s 12 years in power. The cheapest valuations among
 emerging markets  may not be enough to revive demand for Russian
equities, according to Tom Furda, director of Russian equity
sales at Auerbach Grayson & Co.’s Moscow-based brokerage partner
UralSib Financial Corp.  “There’s nothing besides the argument that valuations are
cheap to get people excited about  Russia ,” Furda said in a
phone interview from  New York  on Dec. 9. ‘Oil has been weak,
global growth is sluggish, and now for Russia there’s a question
of the government’s legitimacy.”  Futures  expiring in December on Russia’s dollar-denominated
RTS index rose 0.3 percent to 140,975 in New York trading on Dec.
9, after the measure sank 8.8 percent last week, the most among
the 21 major emerging-market indexes tracked by Bloomberg.  Climbing Volatility  The  RTS Volatility Index , which measures expected swings in
the index futures, rose every day last week in the most
consecutive increases since November 2010, bringing its advance
for the week to 26 percent. The  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index  of
Russian companies traded in New York slipped 1.8 percent on Dec.
9 to 91.81, the lowest level since Nov. 25, and extending its
weekly decline to 8.1 percent, the most in almost three months.  Russia’s benchmark 30-stock Micex index trades at 4.8 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies, the cheapest
valuation of 21 emerging-market indexes tracked by Bloomberg.  Moscow-based  Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s largest natural gas
producer that makes up 16 percent of the Micex, trades at 3.1
times estimated earnings, compared with 6.2 times for fellow
energy producer BP Plc, 7.8 times for  Italy ’s Eni Spa, 12.6
times for Madrid-based Repsol YPF SA’s ratio, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Risky Market’  “Regardless of what you think about the valuation of
Russian stocks, you can’t disagree that it’s a risky market, so
a lot of buyers are on the sidelines unwilling to take on risk
at this point in the year,” Arjun Jayaraman, who manages $400
million in emerging-market equities at Causeway Capital
Management in  Los Angeles , said in a phone interview. “But the
market is overreacting. These are certainly not selling
opportunities given the valuations.”  The  RTS index  fell 4.3 percent to 1,410.28 on Dec. 9, the
lowest level since Nov. 24, while the Micex slipped 4.1 percent
to 1,396.28, bringing its decline in the week to 7.3 percent.  American depositary receipts of Gazprom fell 2.5 percent to
$10.68, down 9.2 percent in the week. The company’s  shares 
dropped 4 percent on Dec. 9, and 7.1 percent in the week, to
170.35 rubles, or the equivalent of $5.42. One Gazprom ADR
equals two ordinary shares.  Lukoil, VimpelCom  Crude for January delivery on the New York Mercantile
exchange fell 0.1 percent to $99.35 a barrel at 11:17 a.m. Hong
Kong time. Crude is down 1 percent this month, after jumping 7.7
percent in November, amid concern Europe’s debt crisis is
sapping global energy demand. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export
blend, climbed 1 percent on Dec. 9 to $108.67, paring its
decline to 1.7 percent in the week.  ADRs of  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s largest non-state oil producer,
fell 8.3 percent last week to $50.85 after  shares  in Moscow
posted a 5.5 percent decline to 1,611.20 rubles, or $51.30. One
ADR represents one ordinary share.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the nation’s third-largest mobile carrier
by subscribers, dropped 0.9 percent to $10.33 in New York
trading, extending the weekly decline to 11 percent, as  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  cut the 12-month price target on the company’s ADRs
to $16.50 from $21.50.  VimpelCom said it will decide in January whether to take
control of Euroset Holding NV, Russia’s biggest mobile-phone
retailer. The company already owns a 49.9 percent stake in
Euroset and is yet to decide whether to buy another 25 percent,
Elena Prokhorova, the company’s Moscow-based spokeswoman, said
in a phone interview on Dec. 9. VimpelCom’s exclusive right to
buy another 25 percent in Euroset expires on Jan. 23, she said.  Rusal, Rostelecom  The Hong Kong-listed shares of United Co. Rusal, the
world’s largest aluminum producer, rose 0.2 percent to HK$5.27.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.2 percent to 116.42.  Rostelecom ADRs fell 3.8 percent to $27.71, and was down
9.9 percent last week, after the Moscow-based company’s Micex
 shares  slid 6.3 percent to 143.37 rubles, equal to $4.55.  HSBC cut Rostelecom’s target price to $35 per ADR from $37,
analyst Jean Kaplan wrote in an e-mailed report. The target for
ruble-denominated shares listed in Moscow was reduced to 185
rubles from 199 rubles. One depositary receipt is equal to six
ordinary shares.  OAO Mechel (MTL)  gained in U.S. trading on Dec. 9, snapping a
three-day drop, as Russia’s biggest coal producer for
steelmakers resumed production at two mines in Siberia after
work there was suspended because of complaints to Russia’s
industrial safety watchdog.  Mechel (MTLR) ’s ADRs rose 3.2 percent to $10.02 in New York,
trimming their weekly decline to 9.9 percent.  Shares  in Moscow
slipped 1.7 percent to 312.20 rubles, or equivalent of $9.93,
before the resumption was announced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
