Egypt ’s Prime Minister Kamal el- Ganzouri said the country may resort to foreign borrowing “if
we have to” and that the country’s economy is far worse than
anyone can imagine.  “To save 20 billion pounds ($3.33 billion) there has to be
austerity in a way that doesn’t affect the Egyptian citizen,”
el-Ganzouri said at a media conference in Cairo today. He said
he wants to reduce the  budget deficit  so inflation doesn’t hurt
poor people.  El-Ganzouri’s government must tackle an economy that grew
at the slowest pace in at least a decade as a result of the
unrest that forced President  Hosni Mubarak  out in February and
deterred tourism and investment.  Gross domestic product expanded 1.8 percent in the fiscal
year through June and Egypt has spent almost half its foreign
currency reserves in the past 11 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
