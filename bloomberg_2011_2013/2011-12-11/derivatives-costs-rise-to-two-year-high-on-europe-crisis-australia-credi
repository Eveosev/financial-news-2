Traders of  credit derivatives  in
Australia are demanding the highest premiums for taking risk in
more than two years amid concern  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
will spark a global financial meltdown.  The gap between prices to buy and sell the Markit iTraxx
Australia index of credit default swaps averaged 3.7 basis
points this quarter, the most since the three months ending June
2009 and up from 1.5 in the same period a year ago, according to
CMA data. That’s equivalent to $3,700 on a $10 million contract
and compares with a so-called bid-offer spread of 1 basis point
in the U.S. and 1.1 in Europe, CMA data show.  “Liquidity in credit-default swaps has noticeably
decreased,” Jason Watts, Sydney-based head of credit trading at
National  Australia  Bank Ltd., said on Dec. 5. “Bid-offer
spreads have widened in sympathy with the general market
volatility. The approaching year-end also makes people even less
willing to take risk.”  The Australian index, which gauges perceptions of corporate
bond risk, has ranged this year from a low of 100 basis points
in January to 239 basis points in October, the biggest gap since
2009 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. caused
credit markets to freeze worldwide. Yield premiums on corporate
debt surged to 286 basis points on Dec. 2, the highest since
July 2009, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  Trading Revenue Falls  Westpac Banking Corp. and Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. said last month that trading revenue slumped in the
six months to Sept. 30 as European leaders failed to contain the
region’s fiscal crisis.  The third quarter was the worst for trading and investment-
banking revenue at the biggest Wall Street firms since the
depths of the financial crisis in 2008, excluding accounting
gains.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., the second-largest  U.S. bank ,
reported on Oct. 13 about a 33 percent profit decline, excluding
a $1.9 billion accounting benefit, for the period as earnings
from  investment banking  and trading slumped.  Australian bond fund managers have increased their cash
holdings to 8.6 percent, the highest since July, according to a
Deutsche Bank AG survey released Dec. 5. In the U.S., the 22
primary dealers of  government securities  that trade directly
with the  Federal Reserve  reduced  inventories  of corporate debt
due in more than a year to as low as $49.5 billion in the week
ending Oct. 26, the least since April 2003, Fed data show.  ‘No Desire’  The gap between the bid and ask yields on  Commonwealth Bank
of Australia ’s A$1.35 billion of 6.25 percent bonds due in
September 2013 was at 13 basis points as of 12:54 p.m. in
Sydney, from 7 at the start of November, ANZ prices show.  “Both local and especially overseas banks have pared back
trading risk appetite,” said Nick Bishop, a  money manager  in
Sydney at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which managed $264.6
billion globally as of Sept. 30. “Coming into year-end, in what
has been a really nasty year for some, there is no desire to
trade any material volumes.”  Australia’s benchmark  10-year bond yield  dropped to a
record 3.793 percent low on Dec. 9, from a 2011 high of 5.835
percent on Feb. 8. It rose 6 basis points to 3.86 percent in
Sydney today, or 179 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries.  Australia’s dollar, the world’s fifth-most traded currency,
bought $1.0186 as of 1:02 p.m. in Sydney.  Corporate Spreads  The extra yield investors demand to hold Australian
corporate bonds instead of similar maturity government debt rose
39 basis points since the start of November to 284 last week and
reached 286 on Dec. 2, the highest since July 2009, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Australia is headed for its worst annual jobs growth in 15
years, boosting prospects central bank Governor  Glenn Stevens 
will extend interest-rate cuts into 2012 as inflation eases.
Stevens will reduce the key rate to 3 percent by July, cash-rate
futures show, matching the lowest borrowing costs since 1960.  Payrolls gained 44,700 through the first 11 months of this
year, on pace for the smallest increase since 1996 after a
record 362,300 additions in 2010, government data released Dec.
8 show. The report contrasted with figures the previous day
showing the biggest six-month gain in economic growth since
March 2007.  ANZ announced second-half profit that missed analyst
forecasts last month. Earnings from the bank’s so-called global
markets unit, which includes its fixed income, commodities and
 capital markets , trading and balance sheet operations, slid 30
percent to A$516 million in the 12 months ended Sept. 30,
according to a regulatory filing.  ‘Hard Hit’  Westpac’s trading income also tumbled 30 percent in the
same period, to A$558 million, the Sydney-based lender said on
Nov. 1.  “Banks aren’t holding much inventory in these conditions,
and corporate bonds are especially hard hit,” Mat McCrum, the
investment director at Melbourne-based Omega Global Investors
Pty, which manages A$2 billion, said in a telephone interview on
Dec. 5. “You still see some good offers from forced sellers but
if you are looking specifically for a certain issuer or a
certain line of bonds, they’re hard to find.”  Annual turnover in Australian credit derivative trading
totaled A$222.7 billion in the year ended June 30, compared to
A$176.5 billion of trading in non-bank corporate debt
securities, according to an Australian Financial Markets
Association  report  released in October, based on surveys of
banks.  CDS Liquidity  The top eight survey respondents accounted for 99.7 percent
of the credit derivative trading volume, up from 90.4 percent in
the 12 months ended June 30, 2007, the report states.  In Australia, the iTraxx credit-default swaps index
“remains the most liquid instrument to express a credit view,”
said Aberdeen’s Bishop. “Even there however, if you have off-
the-run contracts for example, you may struggle to get timely
and competitive quotes from some counterparties.”  Bid-offer spreads typically increase when market makers
become less willing to deal in securities, sapping liquidity
from the market.  The spread on credit-default swap contracts on Commonwealth
Bank, the nation’s biggest lender, jumped as high as 15 basis
points on Oct. 18 from 3 on June 23, while the spread on
Westfield Group swaps surged 15 basis points this half to 20,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The equivalent spread on the Australian index rose 1.9
basis points last month to 5.7 basis points on Nov. 30 after
reaching 8 on Oct. 4, the highest since May 2009, CMA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
