Manuel Noriega has been handed over
to Panamanian authorities to extradite the former dictator to
his homeland, the French Justice Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement.  Noriega had been serving a French prison term on money
laundering charges after having been imprisoned 20 years in the
U.S. for drug trafficking. The 77-year-old Noriega, who was
overthrown in a U.S. invasion in 1989, has been convicted in
absentia in  Panama  for the murder of political opponents during
his six-year rule.  The Panamanian officials accompanied him on a flight to
Panama City via Madrid earlier today, TF1 Television said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
