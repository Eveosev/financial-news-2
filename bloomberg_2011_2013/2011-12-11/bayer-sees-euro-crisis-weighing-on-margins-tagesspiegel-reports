Bayer AG (BAYN)  expects the euro crisis to
weigh on margins in its health unit as well as its plastics
business as consumers cut spending on drugs,  Der Tagesspiegel 
reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer
Marijn Dekkers.  Drug bills continue to go unpaid in  Greece , Italy and
Spain, the newspaper cited Dekkers as saying in an e-mailed
preview of an interview to be published tomorrow. Outstanding
debts have reached a “significant three-digit million figure,”
Tagesspiegel quoted Dekkers as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
