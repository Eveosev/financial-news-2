Scailex Corp. (SCIX) , an Israeli mobile-
handsets distributor, declined to the lowest in more than seven
years after Moody’s Midroog Ltd. downgraded several series of
bonds.  The shares retreated 3.3 percent to 17.88 shekels, the
lowest intraday level since November 2004, at 1:04 p.m. in  Tel
Aviv .  Moody’s Midroog cut the series Aleph-to-Daled and Vav-to-
Tet bonds to Baa1, the eighth-lowest investment grade ranking,
from A3, the company said on Dec. 8. The outlook is negative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
