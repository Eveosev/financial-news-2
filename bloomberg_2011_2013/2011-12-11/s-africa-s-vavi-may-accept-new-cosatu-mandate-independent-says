Zwelinzima Vavi , general secretary
of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, will serve
another term if nominated for re-election to the post next year,
the  Sunday Independent  reported, citing Vavi.  Four of the biggest affiliates of South Africa’s biggest
union grouping want Vavi to serve another three-year term, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing unidentified union
officials. While Vavi said in 2009 he would quit Cosatu and
stand for a leadership post in the ruling African National
Congress, his chances of winning a top party position have
faded, City Press said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
