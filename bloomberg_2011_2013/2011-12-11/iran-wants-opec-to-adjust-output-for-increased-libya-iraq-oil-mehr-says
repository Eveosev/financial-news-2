Iran ’s Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi
said some OPEC members should curtail output to accommodate the
return of Libyan crude to markets and an increase in Iraqi
production, the state-run Mehr news agency  reported .  Iran will suggest at the planned Dec. 14 meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that members of
the group that boosted output this year in the absence of Libyan
exports should scale back production, Qasemi said, according to
Mehr. Iran, OPEC’s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia
opposes increasing output and is seeking “fair” crude prices,
the minister said, according to the report.  The comments reiterate a position Qasemi, who is also
OPEC’s president this year, expressed in a Nov. 11 report on the
Tehran-based ministry’s website.  Saudi Arabia  raised its output
by about 1.3 million barrels a day between March and August to
help offset the loss of exports from Libya during the uprising
against  Muammar Qaddafi . Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
also augmented output.  Libya pumped 500,000 barrels a day on average in November,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Iraq , the group’s
third-largest producer, pumped 2.71 million barrels a day last
month, the data show. OPEC supplies about 40 percent of the
world’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
