Trappist Dairy has restarted
production after  Hong Kong ’s Food and Environmental Hygiene
Department said it was satisfied with the factory’s food safety,
according to the  South China Morning Post , which didn’t say how
it got the information.  The company’s milk products were recalled after laboratory
results showed chemical contamination, based on a government
statement from Dec. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
