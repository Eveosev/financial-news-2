Italy’s banking association will
oppose new  capital requirements  set by the European Banking
Association “in every way” and is ready to take legal action
should it be required, the association’s head  Giuseppe Mussari 
said, according to the Ansa newswire.  The comments followed a Dec. 9 statement from the banking
association, known as ABI, saying the new rules would increase
market volatility and ran the risk of causing a credit crunch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
