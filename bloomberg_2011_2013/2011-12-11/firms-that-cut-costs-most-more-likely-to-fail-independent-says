Firms that carried out the most
severe cost cuts to weather the financial crisis are the most
likely to fail, the Independent on Sunday reported, citing a
survey by PA Consulting Group.  A survey of 200 business leaders and data from 2007 to 2010
found that the firms that reduced costs, particularly for staff,
had a 10 percent lower total shareholder return than those that
did not, according to the London-based consulting firm, the
Independent reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
