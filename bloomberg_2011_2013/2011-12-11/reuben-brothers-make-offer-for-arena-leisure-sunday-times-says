Billionaires David and Simon Reuben
made a cash offer for  Arena Leisure Plc (ARE) , the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The brothers already own almost 30 percent of the
racecourse owner, the newspaper said. The bid is priced between
40 pence and 50 pence a share and would require approval from
the U.K. Competition Commission, it reported.  Arena closed unchanged at 31.75 pence on Dec. 9.  Spokesmen for the Reuben brothers and Arena Leisure were
not immediately available to comment when contacted by Bloomberg
News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
