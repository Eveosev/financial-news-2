Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH is
planning to bid for the U.K. government’s stake in National Air
Traffic Services Ltd., the Sunday Times reported, without saying
where it got the information.  German state-owned DFS last week asked investment banks to
tender for an advisory role on the bid for NATS, the U.K. air-
traffic control system that is 49 percent owned by the
government, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
