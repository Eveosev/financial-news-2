Britain had 11 percent more houses
valued at 1 million pounds ($1.6 million) or more available for
purchase in the third quarter than it did a year earlier,
Investec Specialist Bank said in a report today.  About 21,982 such properties were for sale with a combined
value of 48.7 billion pounds, up 4.8 percent, according to
research from primelocation.com commissioned by Investec, which
said the market is “holding up well,” with a “huge” increase in
mortgage applications in the category. The average valuation was
2.22 million pounds, a year-to-year decrease of 5.1 percent.  “This market is very international, especially in  London ,”
said Jack Jones, head of Investec’s specialized banking lending
team. “This has resulted in some people deciding to opt out of
the capital’s million-pound property market and move to the home
counties, which is more affordable.”  About 105 of the properties were valued at more than 15
million pounds, Investec Specialist said. Of the total, 44
percent, or 9,704, were in London and had a value of 26.9
billion pounds, with 10 percent in Surrey and worth 4.47 billion
pounds, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
