Avago Technologies Ltd. (AVGO) , a maker of
semiconductor components, and watchmaker  Fossil Inc. (FOSL)  are among
five companies picked to join the Nasdaq-100 Index this month.  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. said in a Dec. 9 statement that
 Hansen Natural Corp. (HANS) ,  Nuance Communications Inc. (NUAN)  and  Randgold
Resources Ltd. (RRS)  will also be included in the gauge. The changes
will take effect before the market opens on Dec. 19.  The 100-company measure of the biggest non-financial
companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market serves as the basis
for the PowerShares QQQ Trust, which was the fifth most-traded
U.S. exchange traded fund during the past 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. More than $400 billion in assets are
linked to the measure, according to Nasdaq OMX.  The companies will replace  Flir Systems Inc. (FLIR) ,  Illumina
Inc. (ILMN) ,  NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) ,  Qiagen NV (QGEN)  and  Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)   The Nasdaq-100 has climbed 4.6 percent this year, compared
with the 0.2 percent decline in the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index
and the 4.9 percent drop in the Russell 2000 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
