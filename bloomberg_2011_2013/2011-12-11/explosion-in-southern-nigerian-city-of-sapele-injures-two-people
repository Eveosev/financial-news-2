Two people were wounded yesterday in
an explosion at a mosque in the Nigerian city of Sapele, located
in the mainly Christian south, a police spokesman said.  The explosion at the mosque in the Niger Delta oil region
wasn’t caused by a bomb attack, Charles Muka, a police
spokesman, said by phone today.  “If it was a bomb, we will see the particles,” Muka said.
“We have combed the place. We found nothing to show it was a
bomb.”  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous nation
of more than 160 million people, is roughly split between a
mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. More
than 14,000 people have been killed in ethnic and religious
clashes in the West African nation from 1999 to 2009, according
to the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
