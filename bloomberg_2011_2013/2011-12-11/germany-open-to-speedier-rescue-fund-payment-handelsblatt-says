Germany  may be open to starting its
share of 80 billion euros ($107 billion) in cash infusions to
the European Stability Mechanism permanent rescue fund sooner
than previously agreed,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing unnamed
government sources.  Speedier payment may mean that an initial portion of
Germanyâ€™s 21.5 billion-euro share of the payment, structured now
in five 4.3 billion-euro annual tranches, could be paid next
year, the newspaper said in an e-mailed preview of an article to
be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
