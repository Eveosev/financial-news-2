Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
lost sight of “core fundamentals of capital, liquidity, asset
quality and risk” for more than a year before the government
rescued it, the U.K. Financial Services Authority may say in a
report tomorrow, the Independent on Sunday said.  The FSA will publish its review into the bank’s near
collapse tomorrow, the newspaper said, without specifying where
it got the information. The regulatory agency is expected to
question incentives for advisers whose fees depend on
arrangements such as RBS’s 49 billion pound ($76.8 billion)
takeover of ABN Amro Holding NV, the Independent reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
