Luke Donald  is the first golfer to
top the U.S. and European tour money lists in the same year,
finishing the season with $13.8 million in prize money.  Donald came third at a season-ending  Dubai World
Championship  today to ensure he topped Rory McIlroy on the
European list. Alvaro Quiros hit an eagle on the final hole to
win the tournament by two strokes from Paul Lawrie.  “I didn’t really look at a leader-board until the 13th,
but didn’t see Rory’s name and so knew it was mine,” Donald
said, according to the European tour website. McIlroy tied for
11th place, seven shots behind Donald.  Donald, a 34-year-old Englishman who’s the world’s top-
ranked player, birdied the last three holes at Jumeirah Golf
Estates. He took his earnings from 13 events on the European
tour to 5.3 million euros ($7.1 million), having won $6.7
million from 19 tournaments on the U.S. tour, according to the
websites of the tours.  Quiros yelled, high-fived with his caddie and shook his
fists after holing a putt on the 18th to win with a 19-under-par
score. The 28-year-old Spaniard also won the Dubai Desert
Classic in February, his other European tour success this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
