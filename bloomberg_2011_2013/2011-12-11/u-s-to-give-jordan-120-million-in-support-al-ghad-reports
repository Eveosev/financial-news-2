The U.S. is due to transfer $120
million to Jordan by the end of the year as part of promised
assistance for the kingdomâ€™s efforts to introduce changes,  Al
Ghad  said.  The move came after Jordan implemented a series of measures
to improve the business environment, promote investment and
enhancing transparency, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified Jordanian official. The U.S. transferred $64
million to Jordan in November, it said.  U.S. annual assistance to Jordan totals $660 million, of
which $360 million is in economic assistance and the remainder
in military aid, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
