Jon Teague kicked two field goals in
the fourth quarter to break a tie yesterday and give Navy its
10th straight college football win over rival Army, 27-21.  President  Barack Obama  and Vice President  Joe Biden  were
in attendance at the 112th meeting of the military schools at
FedEx Field in Landover,  Maryland . Navy has won 56 games. Army
(3-9) was the victor in 49 games that date back to 1890. Seven
games ended in ties.  Navy with a 5-7 record will miss postseason play in a bowl
game after eight consecutive appearances.  “The sweet satisfaction of beating Army will wash all
sorrows away,” Navy quarterback Kriss Proctor, who scored two
touchdowns, said in a televised interview. “Whatever it is --
we’re not playing in a bowl game, we are playing in a bowl game
-- to beat Army for a decade is unheard of. To do anything 10
straight times is hard to do.”  Proctor, who carried 32 times for 97 yards, put the
Midshipmen ahead 7-0 with a 4-yard run in the first quarter.
Alexander Teich followed with a 10-yard scoring run halfway
through the second quarter.  Army rallied to even the score at 14-14 at the half with
Trent Steelman’s 34-yard run with 3:34 remaining in the second
quarter and Malcolm Brown’s 5-yard sprint with less than a
minute left.  Proctor put the Midshipmen ahead at 21-14 in the third
quarter before Brown tied the score for the Black Knights on a
25-yard pass from Steelman.  Proctor completed one of three passing attempts for 13
yards. Steelman connected on four of six passes for 77 yards for
Army, which lost its fourth straight game. Navy rushed for 296
yards and Army for 298.  “The season has been a real trip,” Teich, who carried 18
times for 93 yards, said in a televised interview. “I’m proud
of my brothers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
