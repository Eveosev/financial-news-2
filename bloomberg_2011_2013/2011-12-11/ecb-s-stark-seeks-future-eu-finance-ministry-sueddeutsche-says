European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark called for a panel of experts to
review budgets in euro member states which could form the
“nucleus for a future European finance ministry,”  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  “We need a quantum leap among the institutes of the
economic and monetary union,” the newspaper quoted Stark as
saying in an e-mailed preview of an interview to be published
tomorrow.  Stark opposed greater engagement from the  International
Monetary Fund , saying that IMF funding from the ECB would be an
indirect monetary financing that would burden taxpayers, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
