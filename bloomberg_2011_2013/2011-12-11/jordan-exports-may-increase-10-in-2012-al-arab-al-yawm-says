Jordan’s Ministry of Industry and
Trade is forecasting a 10 percent increase in exports next year,
the Al Arab Al Yawm newspaper reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.   The ministry expects the contribution of industry to gross
domestic product to increase to 26 percent next year from 25
percent in 2011, it said.   The government’s 2012 budget allocates 8.3 million dinars
($11.7 milllion) to a program to develop trade and industry, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
