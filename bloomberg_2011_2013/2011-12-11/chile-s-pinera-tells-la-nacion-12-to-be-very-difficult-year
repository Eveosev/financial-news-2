Chilean President Sebastian Pinera
said 2012 will be a “very difficult” year globally, and Latin

the world market, will be affected, La Nacion reported.  Chile is already seeing the impact and will continue to see
it in terms of consumer and investor confidence and
expectations, Pinera was quoted as telling the Argentine daily
