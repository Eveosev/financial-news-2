Electricite de France SA’s plans for
the takeover of  Edison SpA (EDN)  and breakup of assets among
shareholders is “inadequate” and contrary to Italian
investors’ interests,  A2A (A2A)  SpA Chairman Giuliano Zuccoli told  Il
Sole 24 Ore  in an interview.  The French proposal to have A2A take on 800 million euros
($1 billion) of debt from a 1 billion euro total, is unfair and
undervalues the assets that will stay in EDF’s hands, Zuccoli,
whose company heads Edison’s Italian investors, told the
newspaper. The need to proceed with an estimate of debt by an
independent adviser may cause a slight delay in the Dec. 30
deadline set for closure of the deal, he told Il Sole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
