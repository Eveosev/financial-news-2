Spanish Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro said regional governments are on course to meet their
budget-deficit target this year.  The regions posted an overall deficit of 0.77 percent of
gross domestic product in the first half compared with a full-
year goal of 1.5 percent, Montoro said at a news conference in
 Madrid  today. Excluding the effect of a program to accelerate
payments to the regions, the shortfall was 0.93 percent.  Regional administrations have been the focus of concern
that  Spain  may miss its overall budget-deficit commitments this
year after borrowing the equivalent of 1.6 percent in the first
half of 2011. Catalonia, Valencia and Murcia requested loans
last month that would draw down more than half the government’s
18 billion-euro ($23 billion) regional rescue fund.  “There is a perception that our regional budgets are out
of control,” Montoro said. “It’s not like that. They are
making an effort.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
