Google Inc. (GOOG) , moving forward on a
project to outfit Kansas City neighborhoods with an ultrafast
broadband network, announced plans to begin installing fiber
lines in the next few weeks, starting with the city’s Hanover
Heights area.  Of 202 eligible neighborhoods targeted by Google, 89
percent will be wired to the fiber-optic network, the company
said in a blog posting yesterday. Google spent six weeks signing
up residents for the project, which requires neighborhoods to
express interest in the service if they want to be connected.
The coverage area straddles the state border -- a region that
includes Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri.  Google Fiber offers three plans. Residents can pay $70 a
month for an Internet connection alone or $120 for a package
that includes TV service, a digital video recorder and a set-top
box with a tablet-computer remote control. With the third
option, customers pay a $300 installation fee and get at least
seven years of free  Internet access , though at slower speeds.  The network will provide online speeds of 1 gigabit per
second, about a hundred times faster than the average U.S.
connection, along with television programming. Google, based in
 Mountain View , California, will run the program as a for-profit
business and hasn’t said if it will expand beyond the Kansas
City area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
