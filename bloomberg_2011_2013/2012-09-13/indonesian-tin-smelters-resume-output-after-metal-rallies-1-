Tin smelters in  Indonesia ’s largest
producing region have restarted output after prices rallied,
boosting supplies from the world’s biggest exporter, according
to an industry group. Futures slumped.  About 70 percent of smelting capacity in Bangka-Belitung
province is being used, Hidayat Arsani, president of the
Indonesian Tin Mining Association, said in a telephone interview
today. Last month, the group estimated that about 30 percent of
capacity was functioning, with 24 of 28 smelters closed.  Tin advanced to a four-month high yesterday after shipments
from Indonesia, which accounts for about 40 percent of global
trade, plunged in August and orders to remove the metal from
warehouses jumped. Higher prices may boost profits at companies
including  PT Timah (TINS) , the third-biggest producer. The metal is
used as solder in electronic products as well as for packaging.  “Production has been resumed but is not yet at full
capacity,” Arsani said from Pangkalpinang, Bangka-Belitung.
“Supplies of ore are also still limited as miners are not yet
fully producing.”  Three-month tin rose to $21,200 a metric ton on the London
Metal Exchange yesterday, the costliest since May 9. The metal
had tumbled into a  bear market  in May as demand waned on slowing
global growth, prompting the Indonesian shutdowns as smelters
said costs were not covered. The price declined as much as 3.7
percent to $20,020, and was at $20,350 at 5:18 p.m. in  Singapore .  Full Capacity  Smelters are waiting for prices to stabilize before
producing at full capacity, said Sukito Gunawan, a director at
PT DS Jaya Abadi. Producers regard $23,000 a ton as a so-called
ideal price, Gunawan said.  Exports from Indonesia declined 32 percent to 5,645.9 tons
last month compared with July, reaching the lowest level since
January. PT Timah said on Aug. 29 that it was resuming spot
sales after tin rallied 13 percent in the week to Aug. 24.  Orders to remove tin from LME warehouses, known as  canceled
warrants , accounted for 68 percent of total stockpiles on Sept.
11, the biggest share on record. Today, canceled warrants
totaled 7,135 tons, or 61 percent of the 11,690 tons being
stored. Holdings dropped for a fourth month in August.  Companies based in Bangka-Belitung produced about 80,000
tons last year from a national total of 105,000 tons, according
to data from the government and ITRI, a  St. Albans , England-
based researcher. Indonesia exported 96,020 tons last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
