Venezuelan presidential candidate
Henrique Capriles Radonski expelled a lawmaker who is a member
of his party after a  video  surfaced showing him allegedly
receiving bribes.  Pro-government lawmakers today presented a video that
allegedly shows Juan Carlos Caldera, a lawmaker with Primero
Justicia and a candidate for mayor in the Caracas municipality
of Sucre, taking money from a man who wanted him to help set up
a meeting with Capriles.  “No one has the right to use my name or that of this
project we’re building for personal benefit,” Capriles said in
comments broadcast on Globovision. “Given the information we
have, lawmaker Juan Carlos Caldera is out of this project.”  Capriles said Caldera was expelled from his campaign and as
a representative before the country’s electoral council. Phone
calls to the offices of Capriles’ Primero Justicia party were
not returned.  Diosdado Cabello, the head of the country’s National
Assembly, said that parliament would investigate the case and
request probes by the Attorney General and the Comptroller.  “It’s worrying what could occur in  Venezuela ,” Cabello
said on state television. “Behind this there could be a macabre
plan. Money for what? That’s the way the Venezuelan right wing
works. There it is, irrefutable. Face, hand, money.
Corruption.”  Capriles said the government was “desperate” to smear his
name.  To contact the reporters on this story:
