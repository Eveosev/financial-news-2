Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA) ’s Starz premium
cable channel may be more valuable to another owner,  Chief
Executive Officer Greg Maffei said, signaling a possible sale of
the network after a split planned for later this year.  Starz, with 20.7 million subscribers, would offer a media
company that operates other premium cable channels synergies
that don’t exist for Liberty Media, Maffei said yesterday at a
Bank of America-sponsored investor conference in Beverly Hills,
California.  Liberty, based in Englewood, Colorado, said on Aug. 8 that
it planned to spin off all of its assets not associated with
Starz LLC into a separate company by the end of this year.
Starz, which competes with  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s HBO,  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s
Showtime and Epix, owned by three movie studios, will have about
$1.5 billion in debt and an undetermined amount of cash.  Liberty Chairman  John Malone  has used tracking stocks and
financial transactions over the years to pursue tax benefits and
make its diversified assets more attractive to shareholders.
They included the separation of  Liberty Interactive (LINTA) , owner of
the shopping network QVC.  The Class A tracking shares of Liberty Media fell 0.8
percent to $102.52 yesterday in New York. The company’s
interests include stakes in the Atlanta Braves baseball team,
 Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI)  and  Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV)   To contact the reporters on this story:
