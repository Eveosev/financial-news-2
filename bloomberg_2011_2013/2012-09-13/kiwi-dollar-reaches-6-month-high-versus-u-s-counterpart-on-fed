New Zealand ’s dollar rose to a six-
month high versus its U.S. counterparts after the  Federal
Reserve ’s plan to add to bond purchases spurred demand
currencies of nations with higher returning assets.  The Australian currency reached to a one-month high as
stocks and commodities assets rallied after the U.S. central
bank said it will expand its holdings of long-term securities
with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a
month. The so-called kiwi was also supported after the  Reserve
Bank  of New Zealand kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged
Sept. 12.  “It’s pretty close to going all-in,” said  David Mann ,
regional head of research for the Americas at  Standard Chartered 
in New York. “The market was looking for something aggressive
and they do have it.”  New Zealand’s currency rose 1.2 percent to 83.10 U.S. cents
at 5 p.m. in New York. It earlier gained 1.4 percent to 83.24
U.S. cents, the strongest since March 2. The currency rose 0.8
percent to 64.40 yen.  Australia’s dollar rallied 0.8 percent to $1.0547 after
touching $1.0568, the highest since Aug. 13. It fetched 81.72
yen, 0.3 percent stronger.  The Federal Open Markets Committee said it would probably
hold the federal funds rate near zero “at least through mid-
2015.” Since January, the Fed had said the rate was likely to
stay low at least through late 2014. The Fed said “a highly
accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate
for a considerable time after the economic recovery
strengthens.”  In New Zealand, Alan Bollard, the central bank governor,
and his board left the official  interest rate  at 2.5 percent and
signaled it would remain unchanged through mid-2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
