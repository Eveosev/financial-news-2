New Jersey’s projected surplus may
face a “significant” reduction in the fiscal year that began
July 1, according to a preliminary offering statement for a $400
million  bond issue .  An estimate Sept. 11 by  David Rosen , the Legislature’s
nonpartisan budget officer, put the surplus for the 12 months
through June at $254 million less than Governor  Chris Christie ’s
projection of $580 million. The bond statement, for an offering
related to school construction and debt refunding, didn’t
specify how much the surplus would shrink.  “It is anticipated that the ending undesignated fund
balance for fiscal year 2012 will be reduced,” according to the
statement. “Such reduction may be significant.”  The fiscal year also may fall short “as a result of
additional spending and/or reduction in anticipated revenues,”
according to the statement.  Such wording is typical of disclosure language, according
to Bill Quinn, a spokesman for state Treasurer Andrew Sidamon- Eristoff, and  Michael Drewniak , a spokesman for Christie.  The revenue figures won’t be considered official until an
audit later this year,  Kevin Roberts , a spokesman for Christie,
said Sept. 11.  “This is nothing more than the standard disclosure that
indicates the fund balance is only an estimate at fiscal year-
end and always subject to adjustment in the audit, and that
there are always uncertainties in the budget that have to be
managed,” Drewniak said yesterday by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
