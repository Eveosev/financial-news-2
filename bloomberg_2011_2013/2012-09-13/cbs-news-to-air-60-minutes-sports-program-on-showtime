CBS Corp. (CBS)  said its network news
division is creating a sports program modeled after its “60
Minutes” news magazine that will air on the company’s Showtime
premium cable channel.  “60 Minutes of Sports” will begin in November and air
monthly, New York-based CBS said today in a statement.  Showtime is adding sports programming as the network draws
more subscribers for original series, including “Homeland” and
“Episodes,” than its selection of movies. Since 2009, when the
network’s biggest suppliers of films began their own channel,
Showtime’s subscribers have risen 30 percent to 21.6 million,
according to researcher SNL Kagan.  The sports magazine show will feature two original segments
and one updated “60 Minutes” classic sports story from the
news magazine’s archive, CBS said. Each broadcast will also
contain a studio interview.  The show will use “60 Minutes” reporting and on-air
personalities, while adding a dedicated group of producers to
prepare stories, CBS said. The sports program’s executive
producers will be CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager and  Bill Owens ,
the executive editor of “60 Minutes.”  Showtime already carries sports shows on NFL football,
Nascar racing and live boxing and mixed-martial arts bouts.
 Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ,  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)  and Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer Inc., which had provided films to Showtime, debuted movie
channel Epix in 2009.  CBS, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , gained 2.3
percent to $36.99 at 2:46 p.m. in New York trading. The shares
had climbed 33 percent this  year  through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
