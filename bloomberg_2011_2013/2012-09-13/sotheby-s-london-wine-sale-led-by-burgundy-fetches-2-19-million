Sotheby’s (BID)  sold 1.36 million pounds
($2.19 million) of wine at a London auction yesterday in which
eight of the top 10 lots were from Burgundy and all buyers of
those wines were Asian, it said in an e-mail today.  The top lot was a case of Echezeaux 1985 Henri Jayer, which
sold for 49,350 pounds, beating its presale estimate, while a
case of the same producer’s 1983 vintage fetched 28,200 pounds,
Sotheby’s said. The most expensive Bordeaux in the sale was a
case of Chateau Palmer 1961, which went for 18,800 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
