Naphtha stockpiles held in
independent storage fell to the lowest in three months in
 Europe ’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub, according
to PJK International BV.  Supplies decreased 18 percent to 108,000 metric tons in the
week to today, the least since May 24, according to data from
the researcher based in Breda, the Netherlands. Inventories
dropped as refiners used more of the feedstock to make gasoline,
Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said today by phone.  “A lot of  naphtha  went into the gasoline pool and not into
the petrochemical industry,” Kulsen said.  Gasoline stockpiles fell 6.7 percent to 688,000 tons as
cargoes were exported countries including to  China ,  Mexico  and
 Nigeria , the data showed. European traders are destocking summer
grade and building inventories of winter blend, he said.  Gasoil supplies slumped 6.3 percent to 2.32 million tons,
the data showed.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and  jet fuel 
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporters on this story:
