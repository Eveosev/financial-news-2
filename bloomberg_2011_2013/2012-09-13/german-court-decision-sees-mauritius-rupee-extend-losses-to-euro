Mauritius’s rupee weakened for a
seventh day against the euro, its longest losing streak in eight
years, after a German supreme court approved a 500 billion-euro
($645 billion) rescue plan for the trade area.  The currency headed for the longest sequence of declines
since Oct. 25, 2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
weakened as much as 0.7 percent, and was trading 0.2 percent
lower at 39.1758 a euro at 3:18 p.m., in Port Louis, the
capital, lowest since Dec. 1. Against the dollar, the rupee was
at 30.35, the first decline in three days.  The weaker rupee is the “outcome of positive news from the
 euro zone , our main market,” Alvin Jeeawock, an analyst at
Anglo-Mauritius Financial Services Ltd., said in a phone
interview today, referring to the German court endorsement.  The Indian Ocean island nation is a net importer of food
and fuel. The euro accounts for about 41 percent of income,
mainly from tourism and exports of manufactured goods, according
to Bank of Mauritius data, while 67 percent of imports are
invoiced in dollars.  The euro rallied for a third day against the dollar to
$1.2909 at 3:19 p.m., the highest since May 11, on speculation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will buy bonds as part of a
program of quantitative easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
