Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl (CPB) , the
island’s second-biggest lender, received temporary European
Union approval to receive a 1.8 billion-euro ($2.3 billion)
recapitalization from the Cyprus government.  The European Commission said Cypriot authorities have
promised to submit a restructuring plan within six months. The
EU will then take a final decision on the aid. The Brussels-
based regulator can require banks to sell assets or change
behavior after they receive large amounts of state help.  Cyprus Popular Bank last month posted a first-half net loss
of 1.3 billion euros. The government became the lender’s
majority shareholder earlier this year after it bought shares
issued by the bank to help it meet  capital requirements  set by
the European Banking Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
