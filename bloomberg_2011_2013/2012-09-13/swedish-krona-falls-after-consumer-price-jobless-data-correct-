(Corrects to say CPI was less than forecast in first
paragraph.)  The Swedish krona weakened after
government reports showed consumer-price inflation was slower
than economists forecast in August and the  unemployment rate 
increased.  The currency dropped 0.4 percent to 6.5898 per dollar at
8:34 a.m. in London. The krona fell 0.5 percent to 8.5177 versus
the euro.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
