Spain  plans to sell 8 billion euros
($10.3 billion) of bonds in a private placement to banks as part
of its efforts to fund a bailout facility for its cash-strapped
regions.  In the first stage starting on Sept. 21, it will sell 3
billion euros of a new floating-rate note maturing in 2016 as
well as existing securities maturing in 2015 to 2017. The
Treasury has “secured commitments by a group of banks” for the
deal, it said.  It will raise the remaining 5 billion euros around the
middle of October, the  Economy Ministry  said in a statement in
 Madrid  today. A ministry spokesman declined to comment on
whether the agreement with banks had been signed.  Spain created the mechanism in July to allow regions that
have lost access to  capital markets  meet redemptions and other
payments. The facility won’t be ready until early October,
Deputy Economy Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said yesterday,
even as regions including Catalonia said they need the cash
sooner.  The facility is due to have a total of 18 billion euros,
with the state-owned lottery providing a 6 billion-euro loan.
The rest will come from the Treasury’s cash reserves.  The Treasury is using a private placement as it wanted to
finance the facility without changing its debt issuance calendar
for this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
