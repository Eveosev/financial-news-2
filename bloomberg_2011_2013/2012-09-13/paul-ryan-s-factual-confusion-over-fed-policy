We inky wretches in the press get criticized all the time anyway for picking on politicians over their gaffes on the campaign trail. So when I saw this from Representative  Paul Ryan ,  Mitt Romney 's running mate, I figured I might as well pile on. Ryan was talking about the Federal Reserve's plans, announced today, to pursue another round of quantitative easing, which is a fancy term for printing money to buy financial assets. At a campaign event in Wisconsin yesterday,  Ryan said  the central bank is “trying to bail out the fact that the president hasn’t led, that the Senate hasn’t passed a budget, that we have a horrible economic policy coming from our regulations and from our tax policy.” Just one question: How do you bail out a fact?
