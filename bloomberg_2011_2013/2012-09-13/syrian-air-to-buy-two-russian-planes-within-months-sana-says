Syrian Air  plans to buy two Russian
planes in the next two months to make up for shortages in its
fleet, state-run Sana news agency said.  Syrian Air has been able to buy only two  ATR  aircraft since
2003 because of U.S. sanctions, Sana said, citing Ghaydaa Abd-
al-Latif, the company’s director general. She said the planes
operate domestically and fly to nearby countries while the
company’s Airbus aircraft have stopped flights to  Europe  because
of EU sanctions.  Abd-al-Latif spoke after a meeting that Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi headed at Syrian Air’s headquarters in Damascus
yesterday to discuss the financial difficulties the company is
facing because of aircraft shortages and the closure of routes
and stations due to the sanctions. The measures were imposed
following the government’s crackdown on an uprising against
President Bashar al-Assad’s rule that began in March 2011.  Al-Halqi said the two planes were part of 15 the company
plans to buy by 2015. Transport Minister Mahmoud Saeed said he
expected the purchase of the two aircraft to be finalized within
two months.  A decision was taken to restructure the company and
establish a center for the maintenance of Syrian aircraft with
help from “some friendly countries” that were not identified,
Sana said.  The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights  says
that more than 26,400 people have been killed in the unrest,
which has also hurt all sectors of the economy, including
tourism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
