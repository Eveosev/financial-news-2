The southeastern Bulgarian city of
Yambol won European Union approval to build a 93.4 million-lev
($62 million) wastewater treatment plant and sewage system.  Most of the funding, or 72 million lev, for the Kargon
district project will come from the EUâ€™s regional development
aid program and the rest from the state, Yambol authorities said
on its website. The project will serve about 74,000 people.  Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007 and stands to receive about
11 billion euros by 2013 to improve roads, rails and communal
services in the countryside.  To contact the reporter on this story:
