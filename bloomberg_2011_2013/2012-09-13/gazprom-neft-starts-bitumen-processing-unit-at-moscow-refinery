OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of
 Russia ’s state-run natural-gas producer, started operating a 3.2
billion-ruble ($100 million) bitumen processer at its Moscow
refinery this month as it seeks to reduce pollution.  The reconstructed unit has annual capacity to process 1.7
million metric tons a year, producing higher quality bitumen,
the refinery’s Executive Director Vladimir Galkin told reporters
today at the plant. A filtration system was also added to reduce
airborne emissions and water pollution, at a cost of 3.6 billion
rubles, he said.  Gazprom Neft is working on a $5.2 billion overhaul of the
oil refinery, the only one within the Russian capital’s limits,
to cut pollution, boost fuel quality and raise capacity. Moscow
Mayor  Sergei Sobyanin  toured the plant today. The  oil company 
allocated 14 billion rubles to invest in environmental measures
at the plant from 2012 to 2014.  The Moscow plant plans to raise capacity from 10.5 million
tons a year, or 210,000 barrels a day, to 12 million tons a year
by 2017, Galkin said.  From May or June 2013, all motor fuels produced at the
plant will meet Euro-5 standards, Arkady Egizaryan, the
refinery’s head, told reporters. Euro-5 fuel has a maximum
sulfur content of 10 parts per million, making it less polluting
than other grades.  Gazprom Neft is also in talks with  Total SA (FP)  about the joint
construction of a bitumen unit at the refinery with a capacity
of 60,000 tons a year by 2014, which may cost $10 million,
according to Egizaryan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
