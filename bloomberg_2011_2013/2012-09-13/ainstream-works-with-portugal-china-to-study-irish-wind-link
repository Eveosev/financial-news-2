Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd. , a
Dublin-based renewable-energy developer, will team up with
utilities from  Portugal  and China to study building a 5,000-
megawatt link to export wind power from Ireland to the U.K.  The Irish company struck a preliminary deal with Portugal’s
REN-Redes Energeticas Nacionais SA, part-held by China State
Grid Corp., that may result in a joint venture to finance and
build the  Energy Bridge  link, Mainstream said today. Britain’s
 National Grid Plc (NG/)  would also be involved in any partnership.  The Energy Bridge venture has already secured an offer for
5,000 megawatts of grid connection to the U.K., Mainstream said
in a  statement . The transmission line, which would transport
power from Irish wind parks under the sea, is slated to deliver
electricity in an initial 1,200-megawatt phase by 2017.  The companies will complete feasibility studies and a
business plan for the development and financing of the project.
China State Grid is the largest shareholder in Portugal’s REN,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
