What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
speculation that dry weather threatening production in Australia
and  Russia  will increase demand for U.S. supplies, Jacquie Voeks, a senior market adviser for West Bend, Wisconsin-based
Stewart Peterson Group, said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher on signs that demand for the grain to make livestock feed
will climb, Voeks said.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
speculation that hot, dry weather for the next two weeks in
 Brazil  will delay planting and supplies, Voeks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
