Abengoa SA (ABG) , whose operations range
from generating power from the sun to producing biofuels and
desalinating seawater, has agreed to acquire 55 percent of the
South Korean company Hankook R&M.  The deal through its Befesa waste division with Hankook,
which specializes in recycling steel dust, is valued at 60
million euros ($78 million), the Seville-based company said.
Abengoa has an option to buy 25 percent more of Hankook after a
year and the remainder from the third to fifth years, it said.  The engineering and renewable-energy company, the biggest
recipient of subsidies for solar-thermal power in Spain, among
other ventures started a desalination plant in Chennai,  India ,
two years ago.  Expanding into  South Korea  is “an excellent business
opportunity” as the country is the world’s fourth-largest
producer of steel dusts, Abengoa said in yesterday’s statement.
Abengoa shares have declined 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
