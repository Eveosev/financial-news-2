United Co. Rusal (486) , a Moscow-based
aluminum producer, said Russian demand for the metal may double
within seven years as the car and construction industries drive
consumption growth.  Russia and countries in the Commonwealth of Independent
States will consume about 900,000 metric tons of the light metal
this year, Sergey Belski, the company’s head of domestic sales,
said today in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
