Most  Indian (SENSEX)  stocks advanced, with
the benchmark index completing its longest stretch of gains in
about 18 months, amid expectation the U.S. Federal Reserve will
unveil measures to boost economic growth.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 0.1 percent
to 18,014.18, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai. Six stocks gained for every two that fell on the
30-member index. The gauge has risen 4.1 percent in seven days
through today, the longest winning run since March 31, 2011. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index was little changed at 5,430.50.  Bajaj Auto
Ltd. (BJAUT) , the second-largest motorcycle maker, climbed for the third
day this week.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the biggest power-
equipment maker, rose the most in a week.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  ends a two-day meeting
today amid speculation it will introduce a third round of asset
purchases amid slowing economic growth. Data may show tomorrow
that Indian inflation  accelerated  to 7.05 percent last month
from 6.87 percent in July, according to the median estimate of
34 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The  Reserve Bank  of India
meets for its next policy review on Sept. 17.  “If the Fed does something tonight then the market could
push on to 5,600-5,700” on the Nifty, Andrew Holland, chief
executive officer of investment advisory at Ambit Capital Pvt.
in Mumbai, told Bloomberg TV India today.  India’s benchmark  wholesale price index  has stayed above 5
percent since December 2009. RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said
Aug. 28 policy makers must reduce the inflation rate to “more
acceptable levels” of 5 percent or less. Consumer  prices  rose
9.86 percent in July, faster than the 1.8 percent in China, 5.2
percent in Brazil and 5.6 percent in Russia, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The Sensex has climbed 17 percent this year, helped by the
highest foreign fund inflows among the 10 Asian markets outside
China tracked by Bloomberg. Overseas funds bought a net $100
million of shares yesterday, taking investments this year to
$12.7 billion, data from the markets regulator show. The Sensex
trades at 14.3 times  estimated earnings , compared with the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) ’s 11 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
