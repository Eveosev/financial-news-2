The number of  France ’s 96 mainland
departments subject to limits on water use after dry weather
increased by four from the start of the week to 50, the
 Environment Ministry  reported.  The departments had at least one local limit or ban on
water use in place as of midnight, according to an online  report 
by the ministry today.  Restrictions were at “crisis” level in 29 departments,
meaning authorities implemented the most severe level of curbs,
including a ban on water use for agriculture, three more than
earlier this week, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
