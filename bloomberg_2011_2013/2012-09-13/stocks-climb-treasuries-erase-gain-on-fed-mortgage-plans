U.S.  stocks  climbed and Treasuries
erased their advance as the  Federal Reserve  said it will buy
mortgage securities and keep  interest rates  “exceptionally
low” through the middle of 2015 to bolster the economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.5 percent to
1,443.01 at 12:40 p.m. in New York, its highest level since
January 2008. The index hadn’t risen more than 0.2 percent
before the Fed statement. Ten-year  Treasury yields  increased two
basis points to 1.78 percent after falling as much as five
points earlier. Oil erased gains, decreasing 0.2 percent to
$96.80 a barrel after jumping as much as 1.6 percent.  The Fed said it will expand its holdings of long-term
securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month and hold the federal funds rate near zero “at
least through mid-2015.”  “If the outlook for the labor market does not improve
substantially, the committee will continue its purchases of
agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset
purchases and employ its other policy tools as appropriate,”
the  Federal Open Market Committee  said today in a statement at
the end of a two-day meeting in  Washington .  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  called the U.S. unemployment
rate, stuck above 8 percent since January 2009, a “grave
concern and didn’t rule out further stimulus efforts when he
spoke at a gathering of central bankers in  Wyoming  on Aug. 31.  Previous QE  Previous efforts by the Fed to safeguard the U.S. economic
recovery have helped extend a rally in stocks over the last
three years. The  S&P 500  has rebounded as much as 113 percent
from a bear-market low in March 2009 through the end of last
week.  The Fed fought the financial crisis by keeping the main
interest rate close to zero since December 2008 and through two
rounds of quantitative easing. In the first round starting in
2008, the central bank bought $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed
securities, $175 billion of federal agency debt and $300 billion
of Treasuries. In the second round, announced in November 2010,
the Fed bought $600 billion of Treasuries.  The actions also helped send rates on U.S. government
securities to record lows. The 10-year note’s yield touched an
all-time low of 1.38 percent in July, while 30-year bond rates
sank as low as 2.44 percent the same month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
