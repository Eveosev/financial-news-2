President  Barack Obama  called
Congressional leaders to brief them on embassy security in the
wake of violence in the Middle East that has erupted because of
a film insulting to Islam.  White House press secretary Jay Carner told reporters that
Obama, by telephone today from Air Force One, briefed House
Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican; House Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi, a California Democratic; Senator Majority Leader
 Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat; and Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.  Obama updated the leaders on measures to enhance security
at U.S. embassies and facilities in the region. He also thanked
them and members of Congress for the support theyâ€™ve shown for
the State Department and the diplomatic corps, Carney said.
They also discussed progress on a so-called continuing
resolution before Congress to fund the government, he said.  Anti-U.S. Demonstrations have erupted in Egypt, Libya and
Yemen. Attackers in Yemen fired rockets and set ablaze a U.S.
diplomatic compound, killing the U.S. ambassador and three other
Americans there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
