Southern California  home prices
rose to a four-year high last month, helped by an increase in
transactions involving more-expensive properties and a decline
in  foreclosure  sales, DataQuick reported today.  The median paid for houses and condominiums was $309,000 in
 Los Angeles , Riverside,  San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino and
Orange counties, the highest since August 2008, when the median
was $330,000, the San Diego-based data provider said in a
statement. Prices were up 1 percent from July and almost 11
percent from a year earlier.  Home demand is rising because of “super-low” mortgage
rates and a recovering economy, DataQuick said. A declining
supply of homes on the market, “a substantial increase in mid-
to high-end transactions,” and a drop in the sale of
foreclosures, which tend to sell at a discount, also helped buoy
the median price, the firm said.  The number of Southern California homes that sold last
month for $200,000 to $400,000 rose 11 percent, and those priced
between $300,000 and $800,000 jumped 23 percent, DataQuick said.
Sales of homes priced at more than $800,000 climbed 19 percent
from a year earlier.  “August was the strongest month for home sales so far this
year, and the strongest for an August in six years,” DataQuick
President  John Walsh  said in the statement. “Much of the pick-
up in activity reflects a continuation of trends we’ve seen for
months, like the unleashing of pent-up demand in move-up markets
and high levels of cash and investor buying.”  A total of 22,438 houses and condominiums sold in Southern
California last month, up 9 percent from July and 14 percent
from a year earlier, DataQuick said. The tally was the highest
for the month of August in six years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
