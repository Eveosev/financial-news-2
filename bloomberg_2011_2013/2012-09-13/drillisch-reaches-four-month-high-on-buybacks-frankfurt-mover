Drillisch AG (DRI) , a German provider of
telephone services, rose to the highest price in four months in
 Frankfurt  after announcing a plan to repurchase stock.  The supervisory board approved a proposal to buy back 3.79
million shares, the Maintal, Germany-based company said in a
statement today. Together with 1.53 million treasury shares,
Drillisch will hold about 10 percent of its own capital.  The stock advanced as much as 3 percent to 9.22 euros, the
highest intraday price since May 25, and was up 2.2 percent as
of 3:37 p.m. on the Frankfurt exchange. That increased
Drillisch’s market value to 487 million euros ($628 million).  The phone company competes with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,
 Germany ’s former phone monopoly, as well as operators including
 United Internet AG (UTDI)  and Versatel AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
