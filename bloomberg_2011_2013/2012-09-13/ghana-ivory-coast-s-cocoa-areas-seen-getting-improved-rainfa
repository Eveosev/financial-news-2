Cocoa growing areas in  Ivory Coast 
and Ghana, the world’s largest producers, will get improved
rainfall in the next two weeks, according to  World Weather Inc .  Both countries will get 70 percent to 85 percent of the
normal rain levels, according to  Drew Lerner , an agriculture
meteorologist and president at the Overland Park, Kansas-based
company. Precipitation was 40 percent to 60 percent of the
average in the previous two weeks, he said.  “They will see an increase in rainfall, most definitely,”
Lerner said by phone today. “The first part of the month has
been fairly dry.”  Ivory Coast and Ghana accounted for 69 percent of the
world’s global cocoa supplies last season, according to the
International Cocoa Organization in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
