Paul Williams  said he left  UBS AG (UBSN) 
as co-head of European credit sales after about two years at
Switzerland’s biggest bank.  Williams joined UBS as head of Europe leveraged finance
sales in 2010, before being promoted this June to his final
post, which he held along with Michel Granchi. They replace
Emmanuel Duclos, who left to join Deutsche Bank AG in Paris.  “I want to spend some time with my family before perhaps
returning to the market next year, most likely on the buyside,”
London-based Williams said in an e-mail.  Ollie Gadney, a spokesman for UBS, declined to comment.  Williams started his career in 1992 and spent 10 years at
Deutsche Bank before joining UBS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
