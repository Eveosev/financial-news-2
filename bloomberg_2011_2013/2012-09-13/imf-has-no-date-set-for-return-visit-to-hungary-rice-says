The  International Monetary Fund  has
no date set for a return visit to Hungary to continue financial-
aid talks, according to Gerry Rice, a spokesman for the
Washington-based lender.  The dialogue between the IMF and Hungary “is continuing”
after a visit by fund officials in July, Rice told reporters
today in  Washington .  Hungary requested aid in November as its  credit rating  was
cut to junk. Negotiations for a 15 billion-euro ($19.2 billion)
loan were delayed multiple times because of Premier  Viktor Orban ’s resistance to adhere to legal and economic conditions
set by the IMF and the European Union.  The government may complete a deal by the end of this year,
chief aid negotiator Mihaly Varga said Sept. 11. Hungary had
earlier forecast an agreement by October. Talks may resume after
the IMF’s annual meeting in October, rather than this month,
Varga said.  Orban on Sept. 6 rejected cutting pensions and scrapping an
extraordinary bank tax along with other measures to narrow the
 budget deficit  and boost economic growth, which he said were the
IMF’s conditions. The lender said the next day that the list
contained “significant inaccuracies.” The Cabinet is working
on alternate policy proposals.  Hungary  needs to move away from “ad hoc” taxes to close
budget holes and should create a more “business friendly”
environment to boost growth and make budget financing
sustainable, the IMF said in a July 26 statement after holding
what it called a week of “constructive” talks in Budapest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
