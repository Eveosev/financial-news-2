A group of lawmakers from the Czech
ruling coalition continues to oppose a government plan to raise
the sale taxes to curb the  budget deficit , news website  iDnes.cz 
reported, citing deputy Petr Tluchor.  Six lawmakers from Premier Petr Necas’s  Civic Democratic
Party  joined the opposition last week and voted against a
government bill that included the tax increases. Necas, who said
the plan is key for preparing the 2013 state budget, linked
approval of the bill to a vote of confidence.  Zbynek Stanjura, the head of the Civic Democrats’
parliamentary caucus, will hold more talks with the dissenting
deputies and he still believes that ruling lawmakers will find
an agreement on fiscal measures, iDnes.cz reported, citing
Stanjura.  To contact the reporter on this story:
