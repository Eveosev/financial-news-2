Acciona SA (ANA) , the Spanish company
that plans to build a desalination facility in Chile’s Atacama
desert, said today that it will construct and operate the
biggest wastewater treatment plant in  Costa Rica .  Acciona Agua’s $45 million project will serve at least 1
million people in the Costa Rican capital, or about two-thirds
of San Jose’s population on completion, the company said in a
news release. The Los Tajos plant is part of a $290 million
 government investment  to cut the amount of untreated sewage from
20 percent to about 0.1 percent, Acciona said.  The Alcobendas, Spain-based company also has water
treatment and wind energy projects in Mexico, a drinking water
plant in the Dominican Republic and wastewater and turbine
supply contracts in Brazil.  The shares of Spain’s second-biggest wind farm operator
have declined 38 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
