The franc fell a second day against
the euro before the Swiss central bank announces its decisions
on the nation’s currency limit and benchmark  interest rate .  The  Swiss National Bank  will keep the franc ceiling at 1.20
per euro when policy makers meet for their quarterly assessment,
according to all 10 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The
SNB will also leave the key interest rate at zero, a separate
survey showed.  The central bank introduced the currency ceiling on Sept.
6, 2011, after the franc’s surge to near parity with the euro
raised deflation threats and eroded export competitiveness.
Protecting it has boosted the SNB’s currency reserves to 418
billion francs ($446 billion), about 73 percent of Swiss gross
domestic product.  The franc fell 0.1 percent to 1.2098 per euro at 8:05 a.m.
London time after dropping to 1.2155 on Sept. 7, the weakest
level since Jan. 9. The Swiss currency was little changed at
93.67 centimes per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
