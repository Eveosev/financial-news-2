Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, rose
to the highest level in six weeks, according to a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate climbed 99,000 barrels, or 1 percent, to 9.55 million
in the seven days ended yesterday,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest
level since the week ended Aug. 1.  Middle-distillate inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene increased 503,000 barrels, or 5.6 percent, to 9.48
million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies gained the most in
five weeks.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels  including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen were up 494,000
barrels, or 2.7 percent, at 18.9 million, according to the data.
That’s a five-week high.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
