Iraq  has temporarily stopped
issuing operating licenses for all foreign companies and not
just Turkish firms, in order to create a new registry system,
Turkey’s economy minister said today.  Zafer Caglayan said in an e-mailed statement that Iraq said
the decision applies to all companies making new applications to
operate in Iraq. Turkish companies are a majority of the foreign
firms operating in Iraq. Currently, 366 Turkish firms are
registered with Iraq’s Trade Ministry and aren’t affected by the
decision, Caglayan said.  Fawziyeh Hameed, a Trade Ministry spokeswoman in Baghdad,
said earlier that the ministry “has stopped the registration of
Turkish companies for regulatory and scrutiny purposes.”  Ties between the neighbors have been strained because
 Turkey  is sheltering Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who
was sentenced to death in his homeland on Sept. 9 on charges of
running death squads. Hashimi, from Iraq’s Sunni minority, says
the verdict was politically motivated. Turkey, a mostly Sunni
nation, has said he won’t be extradited.  Turkish exports to Iraq increased 37 percent to $5.97
billion in the first seven months of this year, making the
country the third-biggest market after Iran and  Germany ,
according to government statistics.  Relations also have been strained by Turkey’s growing trade
ties with the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, including the
purchase of crude oil under a deal without approval from
Baghdad.  To contact the reporters on this story:
