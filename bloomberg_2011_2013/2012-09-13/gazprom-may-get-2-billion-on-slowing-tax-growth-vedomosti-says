Russia may compensate OAO Gazprom
about 64 billion rubles ($2 billion) in the next three years by
slowing tax increases after a jump in the levy on mineral
extraction this year,  Vedomosti  said today, citing Deputy Prime
Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich .  The government took as much as 120 percent of the
additional revenue Gazprom is earning from increases in
regulated domestic gas prices, instead of a planned 80 percent,
Dvorkovich said in an interview with the newspaper.  As the government debates how to tax natural-gas producers,
Dvorkovich proposed slowing down increases to compensate the
state-run gas export monopoly for overtaxation this year,
according to the newspaper. The mineral extraction tax for
independent gas producers, such as OAO Novatek, will
“definitely” be lower than the rates proposed by the  Finance
Ministry  in May, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
