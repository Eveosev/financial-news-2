India ’s 10-year government bonds
gained for the first time in three days as concern the economy
is weakening fueled demand for safer assets.  Factory output  climbed 0.1 percent in July from a year
earlier, a government report showed yesterday, missing the
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey for a
0.5 percent gain. Yields near this week’s highest level also
lured investors, according R.S. Chauhan, chief dealer of fixed
income and currencies at  State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur. (SBBJ)   “People are probably preferring the safety offered by
sovereign debt,” Mumbai-based Chauhan said. “That is
supporting bonds.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.18 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.
Benchmark 10-year yields have dropped 39 basis points so far
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.75 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
