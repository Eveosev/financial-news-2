The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars dropped to the lowest level in 15 months,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 18.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:15 a.m.
in  London  from minus 22 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The swap is the cheapest since June 14, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was 25 basis points below Euribor
from minus 26 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held at the lowest since June 2011. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, the
Euribor-OIS spread, is little changed at 17 basis points.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.101
percent yesterday from 0.100 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was little changed at 8.5 basis points.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday, placing 315 billion euros ($407 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based central bank from 330 billion euros the day
before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
