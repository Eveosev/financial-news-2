Denmark’s government estimates that
savers will transfer 13.5 billion kroner ($2.3 billion) from
capital pensions into a new taxation plan next year.  The estimate forms the basis for the 5 billion kroner in
proceeds the government has forecast it will book next year,
Finance Minister Bjarne Corydon said in a reply to parliament,
received yesterday by e-mail.  “Should the amount that is transferred from capital
pensions be larger, the one-time proceeds will exceed the
estimated 5 billion kroner,” Corydon said. “Should 10 times
the amount be transferred, the proceeds will be 50 billion
kroner in 2013.”  The government wants to block Danes from deducting capital
pension contributions from tax, and instead make it tax-free for
savers to draw their funds after retirement. Savers who shift to
the new plan next year will be taxed 37.3 percent, compared with
a 40 percent rate that the government plans to charge in
subsequent years.  Revenue next year from the government’s capital pension tax
could “theoretically exceed the budgeted amount by quite a
substantial margin,” Corydon said in an interview this week.
