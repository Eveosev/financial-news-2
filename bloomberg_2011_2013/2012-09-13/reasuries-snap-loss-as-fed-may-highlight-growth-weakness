Treasuries rose, snapping a two-day
decline, as economists said the  Federal Reserve  will announce
today a third round of bond purchases known as quantitative
easing to spur economic growth.  Benchmark  10-year yields  dropped from almost the highest
level in three weeks before the Federal Open Market Committee
also releases policy makers’ forecasts for unemployment,
inflation and the expected path of the federal-funds  interest
rate  over the next several years. Thirty-year  bonds  advanced
before the Treasury sells $13 billion of the securities today.
Initial jobless claims rose more than forecast, data showed.  “Front and center is the FOMC,” said  Ray Remy , head of
fixed income in  New York  at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc.,
one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “The market
is  expecting something, and it runs the gamut from longer
guidance to a QE3 program. I would view this as one of the most
important FOMC announcements in the last two years.”  The 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 10:18 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the
1.625 percent note due in August 2022 rose 10/32, or $3.13 per
$1,000 face amount, to 99 3/32. The yield climbed to 1.77
percent yesterday, the highest since Aug. 22.  The 30-year  bond yield  decreased three basis points to 2.89
percent.  The U.S. central bank will announce additional bond
purchases, according to almost two-thirds of economists in a
Bloomberg survey, while also extending into 2015 its pledge to
keep interest rates at virtually zero.  Fed Statement  The  Federal Open Market Committee  plans to release a
statement at about 12:30 p.m. in  Washington  after a two-day
meeting. At 2 p.m. the Fed will release policy makers’
forecasts. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke plans to hold a press
conference at about 2:15 p.m.  Global economic growth is poised to decelerate to 2.27
percent this year from 2.87 percent in 2011, based on a
Bloomberg News survey.  Initial claims  for jobless benefits in the U.S. rose to
382,000 in the week ended Sept. 8, from a revised 367,000 the
previous week, the Labor Department reported. The median
forecast of 50 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
rise to 370,000.  The 30-year bonds scheduled for sale today yielded 2.90
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 2.825 percent at
the previous sale on Aug. 9. Investors  bid  for 2.41 times the
amount of debt offered last month, versus 2.70 in July.  The U.S. auctioned $21 billion of 10-year notes yesterday
and $32 billion of three-year debt the day before.  TIPS Sale  The government is also scheduled to announce today the size
of a 10-year sale of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
scheduled for Sept. 20. The auction will be for $13 billion,
according to Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory company in
 Jersey City ,  New Jersey , that specializes in  government finance .  Treasuries fell yesterday as some investors bet Fed efforts
to spur the economy will increase demand for stocks.  Investors in U.S.  government securities  earned 1.7 percent
in 2012 as of yesterday, compared with a 2.1 percent gain from
German bonds, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of shares returned 16
percent, including reinvested dividends, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Pimco Holdings  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund, reduced
holdings of U.S. Treasuries to the lowest since October while
saying that more central bank stimulus will lead to a resurgence
of inflation.  Gross cut the proportion of U.S. government and Treasury
debt in Pacific Investment Management Co.’s $272 billion Total
Return Fund to 21 percent of assets in August, from 33 percent
the previous month, according to a report on the  Newport Beach ,
California-based company’s website yesterday. Mortgage assets
dropped to 50 percent from 51 percent.  Fed asset purchases aim to “reflate” the economy, Gross
wrote on Twitter yesterday.  Ten-year notes have been the best-performing Treasuries
this year, returning 3.1 percent, the Bank of America indexes
show. Thirty-year bonds, those most vulnerable to inflation
because of their long maturity, advanced 1.6 percent.  Producer Prices  Wholesale prices in the U.S. increased last month by the
most in more than three years, reflecting a surge in energy
costs. Producer prices rose 1.7 percent, after advancing 0.3
percent in July, the Labor Department reported. A Bloomberg
survey before the Labor Department report forecast the figure
would increase 1.2 percent.  Excluding food and energy, the index rose 0.2 percent last
month, in line with forecasts. Consumer prices gained 0.6
percent, a separate survey showed before the department issues
the data tomorrow. The number would be the most since 2009.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity TIPS, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer
prices over the life of the debt, widened to 2.41 percentage
points yesterday, the most since March. The spread was 2.39
percentage points today, versus a 2012 average of 2.20.  The extra yield investors demand to buy mortgage bonds
instead of government securities narrowed to the least in five
years this week on speculation the Fed will buy a mix of
Treasury notes and mortgage-backed securities.  A Bloomberg index of yields on Fannie Mae-guaranteed
mortgage bonds shows the spread narrowed to 1.13 percentage
points on Sept. 10, the least since April 2007. The gap was 1.14
percentage points today.  Bond-market yields have “largely priced-in” expectations
for Fed debt purchases, Bank of America said yesterday.  If the Fed holds off this month, it will probably issue a
statement indicating that easing is likely in the future,
according to a report by  Michael Hanson , senior U.S. economist,
and  Priya Misra , head of U.S. rates strategy, in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
