Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) ’s dividend in the
medium term may be at 60 percent to 70 percent of net income,
Chief Executive Officer Henri Bonnet at the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA said in a Hospodarske Noviny interview.  Czech banks have been increasing holdings of local-currency
government bonds because of rising deposits, the country’s
improving credit ratings and capital-adequacy regulations that
encourage investment in sovereign debt, Bonnet told today’s
edition of the Prague-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
