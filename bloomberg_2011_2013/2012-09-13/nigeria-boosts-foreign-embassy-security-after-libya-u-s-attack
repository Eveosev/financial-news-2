Nigeria  boosted security at foreign
diplomatic buildings after a fatal assault on the U.S. Consulate
in  Libya  and protests in  Egypt  over an American movie that was
derogatory of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad.  U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other
officials were killed in an attack on the American consulate
that started on Sept. 11 in Benghazi, Libya, while protesters in
Cairo stormed the U.S. embassy there.  Nigerian police are on “red alert” and ensuring “24-hour
water-tight security in and around all embassies and foreign
missions in Nigeria,” spokesman Frank Mba said today in an e-
mailed statement from Abuja, the capital.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous country of more than 160
million people, is almost evenly split between a largely Muslim
north and a predominantly Christian south. In 2002, more than
100 people died in sectarian riots in the northern Kano and
Kaduna cities after an area newspaper published a report about a
Miss World pageant in Abuja that radical Muslim groups said
insulted the  Prophet Muhammad .  Authorities in Africa’s top oil producer are battling an
Islamic insurgency by Boko Haram in the Muslim north and Abuja
that has seen hundreds killed so far this year. Boko Haram,
whose name means “Western education is a sin,” has claimed
responsibility for dozens of attacks and says it’s campaigning
to establish an Islamic state in Nigeria.  To contact the reporters on this story:
