South Korea’s government bonds
fell, pushing the three-year yield up by the most in almost a
month, as the central bank unexpectedly left  interest rates 
unchanged. The won weakened.  Only one out of 16 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
forecast today’s decision, while 15 predicted the seven-day
 repurchase  rate would be cut by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent.
The benchmark was last lowered by a quarter percentage point in
July in the first reduction since 2009. The Federal Reserve
concludes a two-day meeting today amid speculation it will step
up asset purchases that boost the supply of dollars.  “We’re seeing a reversal of recent bond gains as the
central bank’s decision disappointed investors who had expected
as many as two more cuts within the year, including this
month,” said Yum Sang Hoon, a fixed-income analyst at SK
Securities Co. in Seoul. “I had thought the  Bank of Korea  might
take a wait-and-see stance ahead of the  Federal Reserve  meeting
today, but I expect a cut next month.”  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 climbed eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to a
three-week high of 2.88 percent in Seoul, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. That’s the biggest increase since Aug. 16. Three-
year debt futures slid 0.22 to 105.93 and the one-year interest-
rate swap rose five basis points to 2.90 percent.  The won snapped a five-day gain, falling 0.2 percent to
1,128.43 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, slid 18 basis points to 6.10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
