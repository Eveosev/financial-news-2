German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  signalled he’s willing to serve another term if voters
re-elect Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government in next year’s
federal election.  Schaeuble said in an interview in Berlin today that he
feels well enough and a enjoys a particularly “close
relationship of trust” with Merkel after three years of their
joint battle to save the 17-nation euro. Such personal ties are
“a necessity in these difficult times,” he said.  Schaeuble, who will be 70 on Sept. 18, said he is prepared
to stand again in elections due in the fall of 2013 for the
Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, where he has served as
a member of the Christian Democratic Union party since 1972.  “I told my party friends, if you want I’m prepared to
stand as a candidate for the Bundestag,” Schaeuble said.
“Everything beyond that is up to voters and we’ll see.”  Schaeuble, who played a leading role in crafting the 1990
reunification treaty between East and  West Germany , has been
partially paralyzed and in a wheelchair since he was shot by a
deranged assailant at a campaign rally that year. Appointed
finance minister in 2009 in Merkel’s second-term government, he
was forced to miss international meetings in 2010 after being
repeatedly hospitalized.  “It’s true that two years ago I was very sick,” he said.
“I am very happy to be finance minister and I feel well.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
