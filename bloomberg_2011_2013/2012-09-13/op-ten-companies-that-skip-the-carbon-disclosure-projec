The first step to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is to know where you're
starting from. That's why the Carbon Disclosure Project works on behalf of
investors to push companies to disclose their footprints. This week the CDP
released its  annual report , including a list of best performers and no-
shows. Companies aren't legally required to report emissions data, and there are no
widely accepted standards for which emissions metrics should be reported, and
when. That's why groups like the CDP, which represents investors with assets of
$78 trillion, use surveys to standardize and aggregate the data. More than 4,000
companies participated this year. First, the CDP's list of shame. Here are the world's largest companies that
don't provide the requested emissions data: Apple Inc. 
Berkshire Hathaway 
Royal Bank of Canada 
Caterpillar Inc. 
Amazon.com Inc. 
Comcast Corp. 
America Movil 
Lukoil 
Bank of China 
National Oilwell Varco Inc. And now for the world's top 10 companies, by both emissions disclosure and
performance. It's interesting to note where the top companies are located:
Germany 4, USA 0. Bayer 
Nestle 
BASF 
BMW 
Gas Natural SDG 
Diageo 
Nokia Group 
Allianz Group 
UBS 
Panasonic You can watch the Carbon Disclosure Project's annual online  Global Climate
