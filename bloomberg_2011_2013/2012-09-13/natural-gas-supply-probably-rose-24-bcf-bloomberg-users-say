The U.S. Energy Department’s
natural-gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington , will show that supplies rose 0.7 percent
last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s report will show that inventories gained
24 billion cubic feet in the week ended Sept. 7 to 3.426
trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for October delivery fell 4 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.023 per million British thermal units on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange at 10:26 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
