Rainfall is set to return to sugar-
cane growing areas of  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, in
the second half of October, according to  World Weather Inc .  While September will have drier-than-normal weather, rains
are likely to be about average in October, according to  Drew Lerner , an agriculture meteorologist and president of the
 Overland Park , Kansas-based company. Precipitation in Brazil’s
cane areas will increase to 1.5 times to 2.5 times more than the
normal in November and December, he said.  “As you get into the second half of October rains will
certainly be increasing. The rainy season should kick in
completely by the end of that month,” Lerner said by phone
today. “From the very first day in November through the entire
summer season there will be an abundance of rain.”  Sugar climbed 8.2 percent in June and 7.8 percent in July
after wet weather delayed the crop and shipments from Brazil.
Harvesting accelerated last month because of dry weather, with
sugar-cane processing climbing 14 percent to a record 46.5
million metric tons in the second half of August, data from
industry group Unica showed.  “For the next 10 days there will be very little meaningful
precipitation, so mostly dry conditions,” Lerner said. “In the
last week of September and the first week in October there will
be isolated, scattered showers periodically, but these will not
be the kind of rains that will counter evaporation very well but
it will be symptomatic of the changing season.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
