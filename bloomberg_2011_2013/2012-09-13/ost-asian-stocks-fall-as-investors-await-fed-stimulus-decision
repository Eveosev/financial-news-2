Most Asian  stocks  gained amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will announce another round of
asset purchases at end of its two-day policy meeting today.  James Hardie  Industries SE, a building-materials supplier
that gets 67 percent of sales from the U.S., rose 1.2 percent.
Kyushu Electric Power Co. led Japanese utilities higher on a
report of a possible rate increase. TDK Corp., a battery
supplier to Apple Inc., climbed 3.7 percent in Tokyo after the
iPhone 5 was unveiled. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., Australia’s
third-biggest iron-ore producer, plunged 14 percent in Sydney on
a report it sought a debt waiver from lenders.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added less than 0.1 percent to
120.8 as of 7:31 p.m. in Tokyo, with about 16 shares rising for
every 15 that fell. The measure capped a five-day advance
yesterday, the longest winning streak since July, amid bets
 China  and the U.S. will act to spur growth in the world’s
biggest economies.  “Looks like people are expecting some form of easing, and
the market will wait for that uncertainty to be cleared,” said
Matt Riordan, a portfolio manager who helps manage about $6.5
billion at Paradice Investment Management Pty. in Sydney.
“Ultimately they will do something, but it’s an issue of timing
whether they will do it now or they will wait toward the end of
the year,” he said of the Fed deliberations.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 3 percent this quarter
through yesterday as stimulus expectations outweighed signs of a
global economic slowdown. The Asian benchmark traded at 12.5
times estimated earnings, compared with 13.9 for the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 12.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index (TWSE)  gained 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225
Stock Average rose 0.4 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding
Japan Index fell 0.2 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.5
percent. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.8 percent, while
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.1 percent.  Korean Rates  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index declined 0.1 percent as the
nation’s central bank kept the key  interest rate  unchanged.
South  Korea ’s  Kospi index  was little changed as the  Bank of
Korea  unexpectedly held borrowing costs stable.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent today. The index
added 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday, when the Fed began a
two-day meeting, on bets for added stimulus. The central bank
will probably announce a third round of bond purchases today,
according to almost two thirds of economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  Exporters to the U.S. were mixed. James Hardie added 1.2
percent to A$8.70. Techtronic Industries Co., the Hong Kong-
listed maker of Ryobi power tools, climbed 2.1 percent to
HK$12.68.  Export Stocks  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a carmaker that gets 25 percent of its
sales in  North America , dropped 0.9 percent to 3,170 yen. Man
Wah Holdings Ltd., a sofa maker that gets more than half its
revenue from the U.S., slipped 1.5 percent to HK$3.35.  Utilities gained the most among the 10 industry groups in
the MSCI Asia Pacific gauge after the Yomiuri newspaper reported
without citing anyone that Kansai Electric and Kyushu Electric
are considering rate increases. Kansai Electric advanced 9.3
percent to 543 yen. Kyushu Electric, which said it wasn’t the
source of the report, added 9.5 percent to 509 yen.  Apple Inc. suppliers gained after the iPhone 5 was
unveiled. TDK climbed 3.7 percent to 3,075 yen in Tokyo. Murata
Manufacturing Co., which supplies capacitors for Apple’s
smartphone, added 2.9 percent to 4,145 yen in Osaka.  China Stimulus  In China, massive stimulus measures would be
“detrimental” to sustainable economic growth, the official
Xinhua News Agency wrote in a commentary. That came after
Premier  Wen Jiabao  on Sept. 11 signaled there’s more room for
fiscal and monetary policy to support growth.  Belle International Holdings Ltd., a footwear maker that
gets most of its revenue from China, sank 4 percent to HK$14.02.
 Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. (493) , the nation’s second-
largest electronics retailer, declined 3.5 percent to 84 Hong
Kong cents.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. , the country’s
third-biggest lender, slipped 1.4 percent to HK$2.78.  Leading declines on the Asian equity benchmark,  Fortescue
Metals (FMG)  plunged 14 percent to A$2.99, the biggest drop since
2008. The Australian Financial Review reported it sought a debt
covenant waiver from its lenders for the next 12 months. The
company said in a statement after the market closed in Sydney
that it’s discussing potential waivers in the event that
covenants are put under pressure by extended volatility in the
iron-ore market.  AU Optronics Corp. dropped 4.4 percent to NT$10.8 after
U.S. antitrust authorities said Taiwan’s second-largest maker of
liquid-crystal displays used in video screens should be fined $1
billion for price fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
