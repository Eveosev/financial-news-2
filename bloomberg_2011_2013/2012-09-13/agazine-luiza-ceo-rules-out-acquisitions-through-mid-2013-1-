Magazine Luiza SA (MGLU3) , the biggest
gainer among Brazilian retail stocks in the past 30 days, isn’t
considering acquisitions though mid-2013 as it focuses on
reaching profitability goals after its last two takeovers, Chief
Executive Officer Luiza Helena Trajano said.  The Sao Paulo-based retailer’s same-store sales growth will
probably slow to 15 percent this year from 16.5 percent in 2011,
Trajano, 61, said in an interview in her office in Sao Paulo.
Tax cuts prevented Magazine Luiza from posting a bigger decline
in sales growth this year, she said.  Retailers are benefitting from President Dilma Rousseff’s
stimulus measures. Last month the government extended tax breaks
for goods including furniture, appliances and automobiles in an
effort to prop up demand and revive growth. Brazilian retail
sales increased 1.4 percent in July, the second-fastest month-
on-month pace since January, according to a government report
today.  Magazine Luiza rose 20 percent in the past 30 days in  Sao
Paulo , the most among Brazilian retail stocks, after reporting
its first profit in three quarters. The  shares  gained 2.7
percent to 13.18 reais in Sao Paulo at 4:54 p.m., their seventh-
consecutive rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
