Greece  and the  European Investment
Bank  agreed on the immediate disbursement of 750 million euros
($968 million) in loans to small and medium-sized enterprises
and for transport, energy and education projects.  The businesses, known as SMEs, will absorb about 440
million euros of the loans, according to a  statement  from the
Athens-based  Finance Ministry  today.  The deal “brings real money into the economy at a time
when the lack of liquidity is causing problems that are
suffocating the market,” Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras
said in the statement.  Greece and the EIB, the European Union’s finance arm, said
July 21 that the lender would disburse 1.44 billion euros in
loans to Greek SMEs by the end of 2015 via the country’s banks.  With today’s agreement “we signal to the Greek and European
peoples that the EIB is here to stay and that we will increase
our activities in Greece,” EIB President Werner Hoyer told
reporters in Athens today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
