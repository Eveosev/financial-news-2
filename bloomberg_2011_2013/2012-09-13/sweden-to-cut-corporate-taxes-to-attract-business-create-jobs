Sweden  will cut its corporate tax
rate next year to 22 percent to attract business investment,
create new jobs and prevent companies from leaving the the
Nordic region’s biggest economy.  The government will spend about 16 billion kronor ($2.4
billion) to reduce the tax companies pay on profits, four years
after cutting the rate to 26.3 percent from 28 percent in 2009,
it said today.  “Corporate taxes are probably the most damaging tax of
all,” Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  said at a news
conference in  Stockholm .  The government said last month it will spend about 23
billion kronor on new initiatives next year after criticism from
the Social Democrat-led opposition that it’s not using its
strong fiscal position to stimulate growth and reduce
unemployment in the $500 billion  economy , whose exports to
Europe remain at risk as the region’s debt crisis drags on.  Initiatives so far include increased spending on research
and development, investments in roads and railways, and programs
to reduce youth unemployment to boost the potential of the
economy ahead of elections in 2014. About 8.8 billion kronor of
the cost of the lower company taxes will be financed by reduced
deduction allowances on internal corporate interest rate
payments, the government said. The current average European
Union corporate  tax rate  is 23.4 percent, it said.  Trailing Opposition  The four-party government coalition is trailing the
opposition in polls half way through its current term, even
after reducing Sweden’s debt ratio every year since 2009, to
35.6 percent of gross domestic product this year, the European
Commission estimates. That compares with an average burden of
91.8 percent in the 17-member euro area in 2012, according to
the commission.  Sweden, home to companies such as  Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the biggest
mobile systems maker, and  Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the second-largest truck
maker, will post a 0.3 percent budget deficit this year,
widening to 0.5 percent 2013, the government said last month.
The economy will grow 1.6 percent in 2012 and 2.7 percent in
2013 even as Sweden exports about half of its output. About 70
percent of that goes to  Europe , where governments are cutting
spending to reduce debt.  Today’s proposal also included an individual tax break of
as much as 200,000 kronor for investors in new companies or new
financing of existing companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
