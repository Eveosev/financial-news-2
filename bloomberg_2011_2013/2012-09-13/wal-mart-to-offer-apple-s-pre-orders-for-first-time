Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, will take pre-orders for the new  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
iPhone for the first time and offer discounts on the device.  The iPhone 5, announced yesterday, can be ordered tomorrow
at 8 a.m. at U.S. stores, Sarah Spencer, a spokeswoman for the
Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer, said in an interview. The
newest version of the best-selling smartphone will sell for
$189.97 with a two-year contract, Spencer said. That’s cheaper
than the $199 price announced by Apple, which will also begin
taking orders tomorrow.  Wal-Mart also reduced the prices on older iPhones, Spencer
said. The iPhone 4S was cut to $89.97 from $148 with a two-year
contract. The older iPhone 4 will sell for 97 cents with a two-
year contract, reduced from its previous $48.88 price tag.  The iPhone 5 will become the best-selling consumer
electronics device of all time, according to  Carl Howe , an
analyst at Boston-based  Yankee Group . He’s among analysts
predicting that Apple will sell more than 10 million units by
month’s end, surpassing the record set last year by the 4S
model. The iPhone has sold more than 244 million units since its
debut in 2007.  Pre-orders will be available for pick-up on Sept. 21, the
same day the iPhone 5 hits Wal-Mart and Apple stores.  Wal-Mart  rose  1.4 percent to $75.14 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 26 percent this year.  Target, Best Buy  Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest U.S. discount chain,
couldn’t confirm if it would sell the iPhone 5, Katie Boylan, a
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Best Buy Co. (BBY)  will sell the iPhone 5, Jeff Haydock, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail. Haydock didn’t have any
other details.  RadioShack Corp. (RSH)  will offer the latest iPhone on Sept. 21,
Eric Bruner, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. The electronics
chain will also offer at least $200 to trade in a 4S and a
minimum of $115 for an iPhone 4, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
