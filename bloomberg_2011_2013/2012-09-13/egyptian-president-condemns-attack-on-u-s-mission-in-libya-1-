Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
condemned the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi and
said his government was able to protect foreign embassies on
Egyptian soil.  “What happened is unacceptable, rejected. The  Prophet
Muhammad  taught us to respect human life,” Mursi said in a
speech broadcast live from Brussels today, referring to the
Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in  Libya  in which the
ambassador and three other American staff were killed.  The Islamist leader said he supported peaceful protests,
but that Muslims rejected attacks on people, embassies and other
sites. “The Prophet Muhammad and Islamic sanctities are red
lines for all of us,” he said.  At least 16 people were hurt in  Egypt  on the third day of
unrest sparked by a film that ridiculed the prophet, according
to Ahmed el-Ansari, vice-president of the Egyptian Ambulance
Organization. Police also arrested 12 people.  Protesters set fire to two police vehicles and policemen
were injured in clashes as authorities tried to keep
demonstrators away from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
