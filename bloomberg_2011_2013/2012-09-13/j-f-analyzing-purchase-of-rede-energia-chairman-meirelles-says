J&F Participacoes SA, owner of the
world’s biggest beef producer, is looking into buying the energy
distributor  Rede Energia (REDE4)  SA, according to J&F Chairman  Henrique Meirelles .  “We are analyzing it,” Meirelles, Brazil’s former central
bank president, said in an interview in New York today. “We
have a team of analysts reviewing this possibility.”  Brazil’s state development bank, known as BNDES, doesn’t
oppose the plan, Meirelles said. J&F doesn’t have a timeline for
making a decision regarding Rede Energia, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
