Morgan Stanley (MS)  Chief Financial
Officer Ruth Porat said the drop in the financial industry’s
return on equity is part cyclical and part secular as banks will
be forced to hold more equity capital.  While firms will increase earnings as the global economy
rebounds, they will post lower returns on equity than before the
crisis, Porat, 54, said today at the Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit
in  New York . Lower ROEs will be offset by the benefits of a
safer financial system, she said.  Morgan Stanley posted a 4 percent return on equity for 2011
and 1 percent in the first six months of this year, below the
firm’s cost of capital, which Fiona Swaffield, a Royal Bank of
Canada analyst, estimated last year at 11.5 percent. Porat said
the bank has a sense of “urgency” in improving returns, which
she said can surpass its cost of capital.  “If our returns in the 80’s and 90’s were 20s-plus, and we
now have higher capital and it’s a safer structure, there is
room for lower returns that are still attractive and
meaningfully ahead of your cost of capital,” Porat said.
“Returns have come down, but they need to be in excess of the
cost of capital, or investors won’t stay invested.”  In addition to benefiting from an improving economy, banks
will also be able to boost earnings by reducing costs and
capitalizing as competitors exit certain businesses, Porat said.
European lenders have been pulling back from some regions as
they shore up capital and liquidity, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
