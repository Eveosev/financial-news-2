Chile’s central bank kept its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for an eighth straight month
today as the Andean nation posts  Latin America ’s slowest
inflation and one of the region’s fastest growth rates.  The policy board, led by bank President Rodrigo Vergara,
held the key rate at 5 percent, as forecast by all 19 analysts
 surveyed by Bloomberg . Policy makers last changed borrowing
costs in January, surprising economists with a quarter-point
reduction.  The central bank is facing conflicting pressures as  China ’s
deceleration and  Europe ’s debt crisis threaten to weaken demand
for Chilean exports while domestic growth is pushing up some
components of the  consumer price index . The dual risk of a
global slowdown and inflationary pressures at home gives policy
makers little space to change interest rates, economist Benjamin Sierra said.  “The central bank is in a stalemate as it waits to see
what happens, with no rush to act,” Sierra, an economist with
Scotiabank  Chile , said yesterday by phone from Santiago. “But
another month or two could bring with it data that allows the
central bank to start moving.”  Traders and investors polled every two weeks by the central
bank forecast on Aug. 22 a quarter-point cut in the key rate by
March, before ruling out monetary easing for the next two years
in a Sept. 12 survey. In the two weeks between the two surveys,
the government and central bank raised economic growth estimates
for 2012 while inflation accelerated.  Growth Forecasts  Policy makers in their September monetary policy report
increased their growth forecast for this year to a range of 4.75
percent to 5.25 percent from their June estimate of 4 percent to
5 percent.  Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said in a Sept. 11
interview in  London  that growth would be closer to 5 percent
than the government’s official estimate of 4.7 percent.  At an estimated 4.9 percent increase this year, Chile’s
economic performance will surpass the Latin American average of
3.7 percent growth, according to forecasts by the  United
Nations ’ economic unit for the region in June.  “Our economy will keep growing, will keep generating jobs
as it has done this year, in the face of a very complicated
international situation,” Larrain said.  Consumer prices in the Andean nation rose 0.2 percent last
month, compared with the 0.3 percent median estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices remained unchanged in July and
fell 0.3 percent in June, the National Statistics Institute said
in a Sept. 7 report.  Inflation Pressures  Annual inflation accelerated to 2.6 percent in August from
2.5 percent in July, while a “roughly” 5 percent annual
increase in the price of services points to mid-term risks of
inflationary pressures, Vergara said Sept. 7.  Two-year breakeven inflation, which is derived from the
difference between nominal and inflation-linked yields on swaps,
rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.98
percent yesterday from Aug. 16 when the central bank made its
last rate decision. Policy makers target 3 percent annual
inflation, plus or minus 1 percentage point over 24 months.  “In the short term, inflation could be greater because of
the recent increase in the price of oil and food abroad,”
Vergara said. “Sustained or increased vigor in activity and
internal demand could continue putting pressure on capacity gaps
and cause inflationary pressures.”  Still, Chile has the lowest inflation of any major Latin
American economy tracked by Bloomberg, followed by a 3.11
percent rate in  Colombia  and 3.53 percent in  Peru . At the same
time, Chile has the highest borrowing costs of any rate-setting
central bank in the region behind  Brazil , which has cut rates
for nine straight meetings.  Colombia also has eased monetary policy, reducing rates
below those in Chile as a slowdown in inflation provides space
to stimulate growth. Policy makers in Chile have indicated they
may not follow suit.  “The working supposition is that the monetary policy rate
will remain at current levels in the short term,” Vergara said
Sept. 7. “The monetary policy rate is within ranges considered
to be neutral, which provides flexibility to wait.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
