Tropical Storm Nadine may become a
hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean today as it moves away from the
Lesser Antilles, the National Hurricane Center said.  No coastal watches or warnings are in effect, the center
said in a  statement  at 11 p.m. Atlantic time. Nadine is 820
miles (1,320 kilometers) east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles
and moving northwest at 16 miles per hour with top sustained
winds of 70 mph. That’s 4 mph below a Category One hurricane on
the Saffir-Simpson wind scale.  In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Kristy strengthened as it
moved away from the southwestern coast of Mexico, the center
said. The storm, 200 miles (320 kilometers) southwest of Cabo
Corrientes, Mexico, has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, the
center said in an  advisory  at 8 p.m. Pacific Daylight time.
That’s up from 45 mph earlier. It is moving west-northwest at 9
mph, according to the statement.  The storm is forecast to strengthen during the next two
days as it moves to the south of the southern tip of  Baja
California , it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
