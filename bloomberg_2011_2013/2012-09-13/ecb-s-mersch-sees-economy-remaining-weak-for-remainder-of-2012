European Central Bank council
member  Yves Mersch  said the euro-area economy will remain weak
for the rest of the year and gain strength only slowly in 2013.  “Economic indicators point to a lasting weakness of
economic activity for the rest of 2012 in the context of
increased uncertainty,” Luxembourg’s central bank, which Mersch
heads, said in a quarterly report published today. “Beyond the
short term, economic activity in the  euro zone  should pick up
only very gradually in 2013.”  Europe’s sovereign debt crisis is slowing economic growth
in the 17-member euro area. Gross domestic product fell 0.2
percent in the second quarter from the first. ECB President
 Mario Draghi  last week announced an unlimited bond-purchase
program to regain control of  interest rates  and fight
speculation of a currency breakup.  “The spreads between yields at the heart of the monetary
union have remained at high levels due to persisting concerns
about the sovereign risks faced by some countries,”
Luxembourg’s central bank said in its report. The easing of
tensions has largely “remained on hold, with market operators
waiting for the implementation of new monetary policy measures
by the euro system,” the bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
