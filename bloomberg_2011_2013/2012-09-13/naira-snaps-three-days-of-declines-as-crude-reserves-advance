Nigeria ’s naira climbed against the
dollar, snapping three days of declines as crude prices and the
nation’s foreign exchange reserves, increasing confidence the
central bank can manage its stability.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer rose 0.1
percent to 157.85 a dollar as of 2:32 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has risen 2.8 percent this year,
the best performer in Africa, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Nigerian benchmark Bonny Light crude, which has risen 29
percent from a June low this year, climbed for fifth day rising
0.1 percent to $116.37 per barrel. The country’s  foreign
reserves  rose to a more than two year high of $40.2 billion on
Sept. 11, according to data compiled by the  Central Bank of
Nigeria .  “We expect increased stability in the  interbank market ,”
Lagos-based ARM Securities Ltd. wrote in an e-mailed report.
“Due to factors largely beyond the CBN’s control, the outlook
for the naira has brightened considerably in recent weeks.”  The yield on Nigeria’s 7 percent domestic bonds due October
2019 fell 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 13.24
percent, according to yesterday’s data on the Financial Markets
Dealers Association website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million
of Eurobonds due January 2021 fell less than one basis point to
4.823 percent.  “There are consistent foreign flows into the  bond market 
that have provided support,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets
strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said in an e-
mailed reply to questions today. The naira “should perform well
in coming weeks,” he said.  Ghana’s cedi climbed for a seventh day, increasing 0.2
percent to 1.8927 a dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
