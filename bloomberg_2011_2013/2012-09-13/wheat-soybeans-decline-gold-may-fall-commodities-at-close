The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities climbed 0.3 percent to 678.69 at 4:57 p.m.
 Singapore  time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
gained 0.1 percent to 1,630.0752.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the lowest price in two days in  New York  as
rising crude supplies in the U.S. offset hopes that the Federal
Reserve will renew efforts to stimulate the world’s largest
economy.  Crude for October delivery was at $96.91 a barrel, down 10
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 9:20 a.m.  London  time. The contract yesterday slipped 16
cents to $97.01, the lowest close since Sept. 10. Front-month
prices are down 1.9 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures traded near a six-week high in New York
after rising yesterday on estimates of a smaller-than-normal
gain in inventories after Hurricane Isaac shut production in the
 Gulf of Mexico .  Gas for October delivery was at $3.060 at 2:12 p.m. Tokyo
time after rising 2.4 percent yesterday to its highest closing
price since Aug. 1.  OIL PRODUCTS  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
$1.55 to $111.30 a metric ton at 12:09 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of the profit from making the petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock, was in the longest losing streak since July. Naphtha
swaps for October were down 50 cents at $986 a ton, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude rose 65 cents to $19 a barrel at 10:25 a.m. Singapore
time, according to PVM. The difference, also known as the crack
spread, widened the most since Aug. 27. Gasoil swaps for October
climbed 30 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $131.90 a barrel, PVM said.
That’s the highest since Sept. 4.  BASE METALS  Copper swung between gains and drops in London before the
outcome of a  Federal Reserve  policy meeting that may result in
more asset purchases aimed at fueling growth in the  U.S.
economy , the world’s biggest.  The Fed is likely to announce another round of bond
purchases today, according to almost two-thirds of economists in
a Bloomberg survey. The previous two series of so-called
quantitative easing totaling $2.3 trillion have failed to revive
the labor market. Copper is on course to advance for a fifth
week in six on the London Metal Exchange.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold may drop for a second day in London as investors wait
for the Federal Reserve’s decision on monetary policy.  Gold for immediate delivery dropped less than 0.1 percent
to $1,730.32 an ounce by 10:14 a.m. in London. The futures for
December delivery fell 0.1 percent to $1,732.70 an ounce.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn fell for a fourth day after the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  raised its estimates of U.S. and world inventories
as lower demand offsets losses from the country’s worst drought
in half a century.  Corn for December delivery lost as much as 0.6 percent to
$7.65 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $7.67 at
2:51 p.m. in Singapore. The price dropped after the USDA report
to as low as $7.5925 a bushel yesterday, the cheapest since July
24. Corn reached a record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Soybeans for November delivery declined 0.4 percent to
$17.3875 a bushel after jumping 2.6 percent yesterday. The most-
active price reached a record $17.89 on Sept. 4.  Wheat for December gained 0.5 percent to $8.9425 a bushel.
The price touched $8.6875 yesterday, the lowest since Sept. 6.  Rubber retreated from the highest level in almost eight
weeks before the conclusion of a policy-setting meet of the U.S.
Federal Reserve today that’s expected to announce additional
stimulus to bolster growth.  February-delivery rubber declined as much as 0.6 percent to
241 yen a kilogram ($3,104 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange, before settling at 241.6 yen. The most-active contract
earlier advanced to 246.5 yen, the highest level since July 20.
Futures are heading for a 6.1 percent gain this week.  Palm oil  dropped on speculation that stockpiles in
 Malaysia , the largest producer after  Indonesia , may increase
amid a seasonal gain in output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
