European Union soft-wheat export
licenses climbed 29 percent to the highest level since March as
smaller harvests in the  Black Sea region  prompt importers to
look to the 27-nation bloc for supplies.  The EU granted licenses to export 408,756 metric tons of
soft wheat in the seven days through Sept. 11 from 317,685 tons
the previous week, data published online today showed. That’s
the most since the 439,902 tons in the week ended March 20.  Egypt , the world’s largest wheat importer, bought 60,000
tons of French wheat today as part of a 235,000-ton purchase
that also included grain from Russia and Ukraine. Russia’s wheat
crop may fall to 39 million tons this year from 56.2 million
tons in 2011 on drought damage, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates.  Wheat and barley exports from  France , the EU’s largest
grower, are expected to climb in the 2012-13 season on reduced
competition from Black Sea exporters, crop office FranceAgriMer
said yesterday.  EU barley export licenses more than tripled in the latest
week to the highest in seven weeks, climbing to 205,895 tons
from 62,263 tons the week before, the data showed. That is the
most since the week ended July 24, when the bloc granted
licenses to export 238,800 tons of barley.  Russia’s barley harvest fell to 14 million tons this year
from 16.9 million tons in 2011, while Ukraine’s crop dropped to
6.7 million tons from 9.1 million tons, the USDA estimates. The
EU predicts a barley harvest of 53.9 million tons from 51.5
million tons last year.  Total EU soft wheat export licenses since July 2 are 2.54
million tons, compared with 2.93 million tons at the same time
last year. Barley licenses stand at 1.65 million tons, compared
with about 899,000 tons as of Sept. 13, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
