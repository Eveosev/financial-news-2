Prima AFP,  Peru ’s biggest private
pension provider, won an auction for the rights to 90,000
customers expected to purchase a  retirement plan  between Sept.
24 and Dec. 31, the country’s financial regulator said.  Prima offered a commission of 1.6 percent, lower than the
country’s three other private providers, known as AFPs, the
regulator said in an e-mailed statement. AFP Integra offered a
fee of 1.74 percent, AFP Horizonte 1.89 percent and Profuturo
AFP 2.1 percent. The four providers must apply the rates they
offered at today’s auction to all existing customers.  Peru will invite local and foreign pension providers to bid
for about 700,000 new customers at an auction scheduled for mid-
December as part of an overhaul of the private pension system
designed to lower fees, Daniel Schydlowsky, the country’s chief
financial regulator, said Aug. 28.  Lima-based Prima is a unit of  Credicorp Ltd. (BAP) , Peru’s
largest financial services company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
