Colombia ’s imports rose 9 percent to
$5.165 billion in August compared with the same month last year,
the government statistics agency said today in a report on its
website.  Colombia posted a $305.4 million trade deficit in August.
The trade deficit compares with a median forecast for a $300
million deficit in a Bloomberg survey of seven analysts.  Spending on imports has been boosted by an 7.8 percent
appreciation in the Colombian peso this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
