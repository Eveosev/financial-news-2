Boris Berezovsky  agreed to drop a
four-year-old dispute against the estate of his former business
partner Badri Patarkatsishvili.  The lawsuit was withdrawn and neither side admitted
liability, Christian Collinson, a spokesman for Berezovsky’s law
firm, Addleshaw Goddard LLP, said in an e-mailed statement.
Other terms of the settlement were confidential.  Berezovsky, who filed the suit in 2008, claimed he had
interests in Patarkatsishvili’s assets collectively worth around
$3 billion, lawyers for the 66-year-old former adviser to
Russian President  Boris Yeltsin , said in a separate statement.  “Following the withdrawal of proceedings between Mr.
Berezovsky and the Patarkatsishvili family, Mr. Berezovsky
confirms that he has no claim to any interest in any of the
assets currently managed by Salford Capital Partners,” the  law
firm  said.  Berezovsky last month lost one of the largest civil suits
ever in U.K. courts to  Roman Abramovich , the owner of Chelsea
Football Club.  Patarkatsishvili, originally from Georgia, died in Feb.
2008 age 52 at his U.K. home. Patarkatsishvili ran against
Georgian leader Mikheil Saakashvili in the former Soviet
republic’s presidential election just before his death.  The Patarkatsishvili family’s lawyer, Graham Huntley at
Signature Litigation, couldn’t immediately be reached for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
