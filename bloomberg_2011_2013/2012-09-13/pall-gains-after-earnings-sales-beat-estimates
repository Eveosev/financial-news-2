Pall Corp. (PLL) , a producer of water-
filtration and purification systems, rose the most in more than
a year after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as pharmaceutical and aerospace sales
increased.  The shares climbed 8 percent to $62.80 in New York, the
most since Aug. 9, 2011.  Net income dropped 11 percent to $86.2 million, or 73 cents
a share, in the three months through July, from $97.4 million,
or 82 cents, a year earlier, the  Port Washington , New York-based
company said in a statement yesterday after the close of regular
trading. Earnings excluding discontinued operations and
including a tax-related adjustment were 86 cents a share,
beating the 77-cent average of 10 estimates complied by
Bloomberg.  Revenue from Pall’s biopharmaceutical unit climbed 8.9
percent while aerospace sales advanced 17 percent. The company’s
industrial unit, which includes aerospace, reported a 39 percent
increase in gross profit to $67.6 million. That exceeded
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s estimates of $56.3 million, Jeffrey Zekauskas, an analyst for the bank who has a hold rating on the
shares, said in a note.  “The Americas had strong growth while Europe and  Asia  were
flat,” Pall Chief Executive Officer Larry Kingsley said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
