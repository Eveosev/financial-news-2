Investec Plc (INVP) , which owns a bank and
money manager in  South Africa  and the U.K., said first-half
earnings fell after revenue growth stalled and costs gained.  Adjusted earnings per share in pounds is expected to be
lower than the prior year, the Johannesburg- and London-based
company said in a statement today, without giving figures.
Operating profit for the six months ended September is expected
to be “in line” with the comparable period last year, it said.  Investec, which was founded in Johannesburg in 1974 and
listed its shares in London in 2002, has been hurt by weakness
in the rand, the U.K.’s recession and rising mortgage
impairments in Australia. Having made three all-share
acquisitions in Britain in a decade, Investec’s return on equity
has fallen below South African peers.  Investec, which is scheduled to release first-half results
on Nov. 20, fell as much as 3 percent in  London  trading and
dropped 1.2 percent to 52 rand in Johannesburg, its lowest in
more than a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
