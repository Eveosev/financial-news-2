Investec Plc (INVP) , owner of a bank and
money manager in South Africa and the U.K., said banking analyst
David Kinsey left as the company focuses research on its metals
and company coverage and merges its equities operations.  “The sectors we want more are mining and corporates,”
Investec Chief Executive Officer Stephen Koseff said today in a
telephone interview from Johannesburg. “In banking we’re a
competitor. It’s not really a place for us.”  Investec is consolidating equities units in South Africa as
margins decline. The lender said today its adjusted earnings per
share are expected to drop in the six months through the end of
September after costs rose and the rand declined against the
pound. The South African currency has dropped after labor unrest
in the nation’s mining industry spread and the current account
deficit widened more than forecast.  “If the rand stays at 13.60 to the pound it will have some
impact,” Koseff said. “Up to 60 percent of our income is from
 South Africa  and the rand has already had an impact on us this
year of about 15 percent on average.”  Investec, scheduled to release first-half results on Nov.
20, dropped 0.7 percent to close at 52.30 rand as of 5 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
