Japan’s new ambassador to  China 
fell sick and was hospitalized two days after his appointment in
the middle of an intensifying territorial dispute between the
two countries.  Incoming envoy Shinichi Nishimiya, 60, was sent to the
hospital for an unspecified illness, Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Naoko Saiki said by phone. Nishimiya collapsed and
lost consciousness near his Tokyo home,  Kyodo News  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The news comes as a dispute heats up between Asia’s two
largest economies over rights to uninhabited islands in the  East
China Sea  known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese.
The Japanese government nationalized the islands this week and
China sent two patrol vessels to the area in response, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency said.  Japan announced on Sept. 11 that Nishimiya would replace
Uichiro Niwa, the first private-sector appointee to become
ambassador to China.  Niwa was at the center of growing bilateral tensions after
his car was blocked and the Japanese flag attached to it ripped
off by assailants in Beijing last month. He was cautioned by the
government for saying in June that Tokyo Governor and China
critic Shintaro Ishihara’s plan to purchase the islands would
lead to an “extremely grave crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
