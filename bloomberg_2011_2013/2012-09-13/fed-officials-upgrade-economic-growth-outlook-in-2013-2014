Federal Reserve officials said
economic growth will improve faster than they had earlier
projected as they embarked on a third round of asset purchases
aimed at spurring the expansion.  Federal Open Market Committee  participants upgraded their
estimate for 2013 gross domestic product growth to 2.5 percent
to 3 percent, compared with 2.2 percent to 2.8 percent in June.
Estimates for 2014 are from 3 percent to 3.8 percent, versus 3
percent to 3.5 percent in the previous forecast, according to
the central tendency forecasts, which exclude the three highest
and three lowest of 19  projections .  The Federal Open Market Committee said today the Fed will
expand its holdings of long-term securities with open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month. Economic
growth has been too weak to reduce an  unemployment rate  stuck
above 8 percent for 43 months. Officials forecast today that
 unemployment  will average 7.6 percent to 7.9 percent in the
final three months of next year, compared with 7.5 percent to 8
percent at their June meeting.  “The labor market looks like it has a very long slog back
to normal,” Michael Dueker, a former St. Louis Fed economist
who helps oversee $152 billion as chief economist for Seattle-
based Russell Investments, said before the Fed meeting. “If you
look at the momentum the economy had in the first quarter,
there’s no sign of that returning anytime soon.”  Thirteen of 19 officials said the first interest-rate
increase would be warranted in 2015 or later. The Fed has kept
the benchmark lending rate in a record-low range between zero
and 0.25 percent since December 2008.  Earlier Estimate  In 2014, the unemployment rate will be 6.7 percent to 7.3
percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an earlier estimate
of 7 percent to 7.7 percent.  Fed officials update their economic forecasts four times a
year. Twelve members of the FOMC vote on the policy statement,
while the interest-rate and economic projections reflect the
views of all 19 Fed officials.  Not since February has monthly payroll growth topped the
150,000 to 200,000 level Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  says is needed
to reduce unemployment.  Employers added 96,000 jobs in August, down from 141,000 in
July, the Labor Department said Sept. 7. The 226,000 average
pace of growth in the first quarter of this year plunged to
67,000 in the second quarter.  The unemployment rate declined to 8.1 percent last month
from 8.3 percent as 368,000 Americans left the  labor force . More
than  12.5 million  in the U.S. are out of work, and more than 5
million have been jobless for at least six months.  Key Part  Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  is using
unemployment as a key part of his pitch to voters that President
 Barack Obama  doesn’t deserve a second term. Romney suggested in
 Iowa  last week that Obama is relying on the Fed to spur an
economic recovery his policies failed to create. The jobless
rate has persisted above 8 percent since February 2009, the
president’s first full month in office.  Speculation that central banks would do more to boost
growth is lifting stocks. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose
to 1,437.92 on Sept. 7, the highest close since January 2008 and
within 10 percent of its all-time high in October 2007, after
the  European Central Bank  announced a bond-buying plan.  The  U.S. economy  grew 2 percent in the first quarter of
this year before slowing to 1.7 percent in the following three
months. GDP will expand 1.8 percent in the third quarter and 2.1
percent in the fourth, according to the median of 76 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Depressed Earnings  Weaker economic growth has depressed the earnings outlook
at U.S. companies from  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  to Intel Corp. Memphis,
Tennessee-based FedEx, operator of the world’s largest cargo
airline, said Sept. 4 that declining package volume will reduce
profit for the quarter that ended Aug. 31.  Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, cut its
third-quarter sales forecast Sept. 7 on declining demand for
personal computers from corporate customers in a “challenging
macroeconomic environment,” according to a statement from the
 Santa Clara , California-based company.  “The economy is frustratingly slow,” Steven Blitz, chief
economist at New York-based ITG Investment Research Inc., said
before the projections were released. “In the face of
uncertainty, people just put their hands in their pockets and
stop, and we’re getting a fair bit of that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
