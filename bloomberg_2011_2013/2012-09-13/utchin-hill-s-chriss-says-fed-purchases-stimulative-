Neil Chriss, founder of $1.1
billion hedge fund Hutchin Hill Capital LP, said the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s program to buy mortgage securities is
“maximally stimulative.”  “This is a program that in size is as big as the first
quantitative easing,” Chriss said at the Bloomberg Markets 50
Summit in  New York  today.  The Fed said today it will expand its holdings of long-term
securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month in a third round of quantitative easing as it seeks
to boost growth and reduce unemployment.  Chriss said he was “bearish” on the economy and
“cautious” in positioning his hedge fund. Chriss, a former
portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors LP, started the firm
with $300 million from Renaissance Technologies Corp. founder
 James Simons .  To contact the reporter on this story:
