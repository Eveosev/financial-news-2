Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil company, started pumping oil from its
Chinook field in the  Gulf of Mexico  after more than a year of
delays because of tighter U.S. regulations and faulty equipment.  Petrobras, the world’s biggest oil producer in waters
deeper than 300 meters (984 feet), started on Sept. 6 to produce
crude from the Chinook-4 well, the Rio de Janeiro-based company
said today in a statement. Chinook is located off the coast of
Louisiana at a depth of about 8,000 meters.  Petrobras was relying on output from the 80,000-barrel-a-
day Chinook-Cascade project in the Gulf to avoid its first
annual production drop since 2004 as offshore discoveries fail
to counter aging field declines. The company has encountered
delays of more than a year to get equipment and rigs needed to
develop the Americas’ largest oil discoveries in three decades.  The producer didn’t say how much oil was pumping from
Chinook-4.  Petrobras rose 4.1 percent to close at 22.90 reais in  Sao
Paulo . The shares are gaining 9 percent this week, heading for
their best week since Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
