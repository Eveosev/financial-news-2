Strikes in South African mean
global platinum supplies may fall short of demand this year,
according to OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel ,  Russia ’s nickel and
platinum producer.  “Our estimate is that  South Africa  will lose 350,000 to
400,000 ounces of production this year and that a surplus in the
market would be immaterial if any,” Yuriy Sobolev, director of
sales, said in response to questions by e-mail. The company
initially expected a platinum surplus in 2012, he said.  Platinum futures rallied to the highest in more than five
months yesterday on concern that supplies will be disrupted by
labor unrest in South Africa, the world’s largest producer of
the precious metal. Strikes and pit closures meant mining
companies extracted 380,000 ounces less than they could have
this year, equivalent to about 6 percent of global output,
Deutsche Bank AG estimates.  Platinum has risen 18 percent from the start of the year on
London Metal Exchange. Nickel, which makes up the bulk of
Norilsk’s output, has fallen 10 percent to $16,748 a ton and
copper has advanced 6.5 percent.  Norilsk doesn’t expect a further slump in  commodities
markets  in the near future as metal prices are too low for
production to keep pace with consumption, Sobolev said. “At
$16,000 a ton of nickel, 30 percent of the producers are most
likely making losses.”  Nickel consumption has grown at about 3 percent to 4
percent a year, slightly better than forecast, Sobolev said. It
is likely to grow 4 percent this year “and maybe slightly
better in 2013,” mostly from the stainless steel sector in
China and  India , he said.  “It’s an exaggeration to label it as a depression,” even
with current growth rates in the  steel industry  lower than
average, he said. Nickel demand is 30 percent higher than in
2009, which was “the lowest point,” Sobolev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
