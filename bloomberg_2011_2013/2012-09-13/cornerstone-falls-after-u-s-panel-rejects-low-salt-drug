Cornerstone Therapeutics Inc. (CRTX)  fell
the most in almost four years after regulatory advisers voted
against approval of its experimental drug to treat a lack of
salt in blood.  Cornerstone decreased 21 percent to $5.10 at the close in
 New York , the largest drop since December 2008. The shares have
fallen 8.9 percent this year.  A U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  advisory panel voted
against two uses of the drug lixivaptan to treat the condition
known as hyponatremia. The FDA is scheduled to decide whether to
approve the therapy by Oct. 29 and isn’t required to follow the
panel’s recommendation.  Cornerstone views today “as another step in the process of
bringing lixivaptan to market for patients,” Craig Collard,
chief executive officer of the Cary, North Carolina-based
company, said in a statement.  Hyponatremia affects as many as 6 million people in the
U.S., according to the company. The advisory panel voted 8-0
against using lixivaptan to treat hyponatremia tied to heart
failure and 5-3 against using the medicine to treat the disease
linked to a syndrome in which the body produces excessive levels
of hormones that help the body conserve water.  To contact the reporters on this story:
