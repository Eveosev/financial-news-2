Sajid Javid, the U.K. Treasury
minister responsible for overseeing state-owned  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  said his
instinct was to unwind the government’s holdings.  “Politicians should have nothing to do with running
commercial banks,” Javid, a Conservative lawmaker who was
appointed Economic Secretary earlier this month, told the
 Evening Standard newspaper , in comments confirmed by the
Treasury.  Javid’s role at the Treasury has been extended to include
responsibility for the state-owned banks that were rescued in
2008. His comments are in line with those of Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne , who before the May 2010 election
suggested shares in the banks could be sold to the public at a
discount.  A former managing director at Deutsche Bank AG, Javid urged
bankers to work harder to improve their image with the public.
“Most people would be surprised to learn that the financial
sector is the biggest contributor to  corporation tax , or that it
has more than 2 million employees who between them are the
biggest contributors as a sector to income tax,” he said.
“It’s these taxes that make a significant contribution to
paying for the public services we rely on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
