The U.S. appealed an order
permanently blocking enforcement of a law that opponents claim
may subject them to indefinite military detention for activities
including news reporting and political activism.  Lawyers from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
 Manhattan  today filed papers seeking review of yesterday’s
ruling on the law, which is part of the National Defense
Authorization Act for 2012. In the ruling, U.S. District Judge
Katherine Forrest said the law is unconstitutionally vague.  Forrest extended a preliminary injunction she had entered
in May and said that the statute violates rights guaranteed by
the First, Fifth and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  The suit challenging the law was filed Jan. 13 by a group
including former New York Times reporter Christopher Hedges. The
plaintiffs contend that Section 1021(b)(2) of the law allows for
detention of citizens and permanent residents taken into custody
in the U.S. on “suspicion of providing substantial support” to
groups engaged in hostilities against the U.S. such as al-Qaeda
and the Taliban.  The case is Hedges v. Obama, 12-cv-00331, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
