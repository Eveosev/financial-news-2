Gold topped $1,770 an ounce for the
first time since February after the  Federal Reserve  announced a
third round of round of quantitative easing to boost the  U.S.
economy  and reduce unemployment.  The central bank said today that it will expand its
holdings of long-term securities with open-ended purchases of
$40 billion of mortgage debt a month. Gold jumped 3.1 percent
last week amid speculation that the Fed would announce measures
to stimulate economic growth, increasing demand for the metal as
an inflation hedge.  “Prices are reacting to the Fed’s announcements,” William Rhind, the managing director at ETF Securities in  New York , said
in a telephone interview. “The inflation worries will be back
because of ‘open-ended purchases.’”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 2.2 percent to
settle at $1,772.10 at 1:34 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the
biggest gain since June 29. Earlier, the price reached $1,775,
the highest for a most-active contract since Feb. 29.  “If the outlook for the labor market does not improve
substantially, the committee will continue its purchases of
agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset
purchases and employ its other policy tools as appropriate,”
the  Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement.  Gold surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of quantitative
easing.  The metal may climb to a record this year on demand for a
haven amid concern the global economy will falter, Rhind said.
Gold surged to an all-time high of $1,923.70 on Sept. 6, 2011,
partly because of  Europe ’s debt woes.  Silver Jumps  Silver futures for December delivery jumped 4.5 percent to
$34.778 an ounce, the biggest gain since June 29. Earlier, the
price reached $34.87, the highest since March 5.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery increased 1.8 percent to $1,679.50 an ounce.
