Iraq’s central government must pay
money owed to international  oil companies  working in the
country’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, the territory’s prime
minister said.  The Kurdish region will continue to supply crude to Iraq’s
main export pipeline if the Kurds can reach an accord with the
government in Baghdad about the payments, Nechirvan Barzani said
in a statement posted today on the Kurdistan Regional
Government’s  website . A Kurdish delegation will visit Baghdad
soon to discuss the matter, Barzani said.  Oil producers including Total SA, Exxon Mobil Corp. and
Chevron Corp. have recently agreed to do business with Kurdish
authorities, angering the central government, which is disputing
with the KRG over how to share revenue from oil produced at
Kurdish fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
