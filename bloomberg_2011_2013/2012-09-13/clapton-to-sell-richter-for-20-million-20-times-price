Eric Clapton  is selling a painting by  Gerhard Richter  valued at $20 million -- almost 20 times what he paid for it in 2001.  The 1994 oil-on-canvas “Abstraktes Bild (809-4)” is one of a series of three Richter paintings bought by the U.K.-born rock guitarist for $3.4 million in total at  Sotheby’s (BID)   New York  in November 2001. At the time, this was an auction record for a lot containing abstracts by the German artist.  Executed predominantly in red, dark blue and yellow, the work is being re-offered by Sotheby’s in  London  for its “Frieze Week” auction of contemporary artworks on Oct. 12. It has an estimate of 9 million pounds ($14.5 million) to 12 million pounds, according to a news release issued today.  Richter, 80, who works in Cologne in both figurative and abstract idioms, has become the world’s most bankable living artist, dealers said.  When Clapton bought his painting, the average auction sale price of Richter’s work was $461,910, according to the database  Artnet . This year, his successful lots average $2.6 million, an increase of 44 percent on 2011, said an Artnet Artist Index Report.  The artist’s highly decorative abstractions, often painted with a squeegee, have become particularly sought-after by wealthy international collectors. They have set seven of the 10 highest prices paid for the artist at auction.  Values have been boosted by the critical and popular success of recent retrospectives at Tate Modern, London, and the Pompidou Center, Paris, dealers said.  The auction record for the artist is the $21.8 million paid for the 1993 “Abstraktes Bild (798-3)” at Christie’s International in New York in May.  Together with the other two that Clapton bought, the  painting being sold was worth about a third of the $3.4 million  price which included fees.
