Treasury 30-year bonds gained as
the U.S. sold $13 billion of the securities before the  Federal
Reserve  is forecast to announce a third round of bond buying to
spur economic growth.  The long-bond sale  yielded  2.896 percent, compared with a
forecast of 2.929 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of six of
the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.68, versus an average of 2.62 at the
past 10 sales. Treasuries rose earlier before the Fed issues a
statement at 12:30 p.m. in  Washington  that may include an
extension until 2015 of its vow to keep  interest rates  low.  “The auction was surprisingly good, coming in better than
expected, suggesting there is demand for the sector at these
yield levels,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in  New
York  of government and agency debt trading at R.W. Pressprich &
Co., a fixed-income broker and dealer for institutional
investors. “It’s comforting that we had a solid auction ahead
of the uncertainty of the Fed. The key to the day is the Fed.”  The yield on the benchmark  30-year bond  dropped four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.88 percent in trading in
New York at 12:01 p.m., according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. Ten-year note yields decreased four basis points to 1.72
percent.  The yield at today’s offering compared with 2.825 percent
at last month’s sale of 30-year securities.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 38.7 percent of the bonds today,
compared with 36.7 percent at the last 30-year auction, on Aug.
9. The average for the past 10 offerings is 32.2 percent.  Direct Bidders  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.4 percent,
compared with 7.7 percent of the securities at last month’s
sale, the fewest since January. The average at the past 10
auctions is 15.4 percent.  “It was a strong auction,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of
Treasury trading at Bank of  Nova Scotia  in New York, which as a
primary dealer is required to bid in U.S. debt sales. “We’re
going to chop around until the Fed announcement.”  Today’s offering completed this week’s note and bond
auctions totaling $66 billion. The U.S. sold $21 billion of 10-
year notes yesterday and $32 billion of three-year debt on Sept.
11. The 10-year securities drew a bid-to-cover  ratio  of 2.85.  The government said today it will sell $13 billion in 10-
year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on Sept. 20.  FOMC Statement  Benchmark  10-year yields  dropped earlier from almost the
highest level in three weeks before the  Federal Open Market
Committee  issues its statement. The central bank already bought
$2.3 trillion of assets from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of the
quantitative-easing stimulus strategy.  The Fed also will release policy makers’ forecasts for
unemployment, inflation and the expected path of the federal-
funds interest rate over the next several years. Initial jobless
claims rose more than forecast, data showed.  “Front and center is the FOMC,” said  Ray Remy , head of
fixed income in New York at the primary dealer Daiwa Capital
Markets America Inc. “The market is  expecting something, and it
runs the gamut from longer guidance to a QE3 program. I would
view this as one of the most important FOMC announcements in the
last two years.”  Yield Forecast  The yield on the 10-year note will be little changed at
1.74 percent at the end of 2012, according to the median
forecast of 70 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News from Sept.
7 to 12.  Initial claims for  unemployment benefits  in the U.S.
increased to 382,000 in the week ended Sept. 8, from a revised
367,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported. The
median forecast of 50 economists in a  Bloomberg News  survey was
for a rise to 370,000.  Investors in Treasuries earned 1.7 percent in 2012 as of
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Treasury
Master index. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  of shares
returned 16 percent, including reinvested dividends, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
