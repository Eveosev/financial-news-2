Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) , the oil and
gas producer whose new Chief Executive Officer Hal Kvisle
pledged to “rationalize” the company on Sept. 10, will sell
its non-producing oil assets in  Peru  and is in talks with
potential buyers.  The Calgary-based company didn’t get “competitive bids”
for its entire position in the South American country in a
process that ended on Sept. 11 and began in the spring, and is
now “in discussions with several parties” to sell stakes in
individual blocks, Phoebe Buckland, a company spokeswoman, said
today in a phone interview.  “We’ve been unable to build a material resource position
in Peru,” she said. Talisman made a light oil discovery in the
Block 64 area that the company operates and is exiting Peru to
focus on near-term production of natural gas liquids, Buckland
said.  Kvisle, the Talisman director and former CEO of pipeline
company  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) , said in an interview on Sept. 10, the
day he took over from John Manzoni, that the company had too
many assets and needed to rationalize, continuing to focus on
 North America , the  North Sea  and Southeast Asia.  Talisman is the operator of two blocks in the area and has
non-operated interests in two other blocks in northern Peru,
where it has been exploring since 2004, according to a  statement 
issued in the country and posted on the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
