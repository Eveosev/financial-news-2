Staff at the U.S. consulate in
Berlin were evacuated after a suspicious envelope was
intercepted.  German police and the fire brigade are investigating the
incident at the former U.S. embassy building on Clay Allee in
the west of the German capital, police spokesman Michael Merkle
said by telephone. The consulate, which processes U.S. visa
applications, is in a different location from the embassy
building in downtown Berlin.  A woman employee in the visa section of the consulate
complained of breathing difficulties today as a result of what
Merkle said was a “strange, gassy smell.” That section of the
consulate was evacuated and police experts are now
investigating, he said.  A U.S. diplomat in Berlin, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity, said that a visa applicant had submitted an
envelope with a suspicious smell. Police have no further
information on the source of the incident, Merkle said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
