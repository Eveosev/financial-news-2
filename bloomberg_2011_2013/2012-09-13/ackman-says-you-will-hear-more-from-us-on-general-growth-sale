Bill Ackman , the hedge-fund manager
pushing  General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP)  to put itself up for
sale, isn’t giving up after the mall owner said it plans to
remain independent.  “You can expect you will hear more from us on this
topic,” Ackman, the head of Pershing Square Capital Management
LP, said in a telephone interview today.  Pershing Square, General Growth’s No. 2 shareholder, first
urged the landlord on Aug. 23 to form a committee to consider
selling the company. Ackman said at the time that  Simon Property
Group Inc. (SPG)  was interested in buying its smaller competitor.
General Growth should “initiate negotiations with Simon
promptly,” he said in a letter filed Aug. 27 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  General Growth, the second-largest U.S. mall owner, said on
Sept. 11 that shareholders would be better off if it continued
on its own.  Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A) , which holds more
than 40 percent of the Chicago-based company and is its biggest
investor, also said it didn’t want to sell its stake.  Simon has “no interest in General Growth,” Stephen Sterrett, chief financial officer of the Indianapolis-based
company, said on Sept. 11 at a Barclays Plc conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
