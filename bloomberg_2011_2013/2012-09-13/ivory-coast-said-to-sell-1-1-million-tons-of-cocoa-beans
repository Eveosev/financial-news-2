(Corrects timing of auctions in second paragraph.)  Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest
cocoa grower, has sold about 1.1 million metric tons of beans
this year through auctions where buyers purchase the crop before
the actual harvest, an industry official said.  The twice-daily auctions, organized by the government’s
Coffee and Cocoa Council and introduced in January as part of
industry changes, will continue until the start of the 2012-13
harvesting season on Oct. 1, the official said, declining to be
identified because the information hasn’t been publicly
released.  The next main crop harvest in Ivory Coast, estimated by the
council to be 1 million tons to 1.2 million tons, will be put up
for sale, he said. The country aims to sell at least 80 percent
of the total 2012-13 harvest through the auctions, he said.  Ivory Coast harvests the bulk of its crop during the
October-to-March main season, with a light, or mid, crop that
produces smaller beans running from April to September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
