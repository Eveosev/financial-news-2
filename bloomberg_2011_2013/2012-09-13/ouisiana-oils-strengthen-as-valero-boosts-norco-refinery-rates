Louisiana  crudes gained against
futures as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  returned the St. Charles refinery
in Norco, Louisiana, to scheduled output after a shutdown caused
by Hurricane Isaac last month.  “The St. Charles refinery is operating at planned rates,”
 Bill Day , a San Antonio-based spokesman for the company, said in
an e-mail.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
widened 25 cents a barrel to $18.50 at 2:04 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark added
20 cents to $18.20 a barrel.  Poseidon’s  premium  narrowed 45 cents to $12.75. Mars
Blend’s decreased 50 cents to $12.75 a barrel over WTI and
Southern Green Canyon’s was unchanged at $11.50.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, was unchanged at
$16.75 above WTI.  In Canada, Syncrude’s premium to WTI was steady at $14.25 a
