Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, rose 17 percent
in the latest week as a barley cargo destined for  Iran  more than
made up for a lack of wheat cargoes to North Africa.  Outgoing grain cargoes rose to 90,000 metric tons between
Sept. 6 and Sept. 12 from 76,597 tons a week earlier, the  Seine
River port  wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Shipments in the week included 49,150 tons of wheat, down
from 73,791 tons a week earlier, while barley exports advanced
to 40,850 tons from 2,806 tons. Iran was the largest destination
with 37,700 tons of feed barley, followed by Cameroon with
23,450 tons of wheat.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay, with a
share of 17 percent, and Dunkirk on the  North Sea , at 11 percent
of the total, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
