Florence Mayor Matteo Renzi said
he’ll challenge Pier Luigi Bersani, head of the  Democratic
Party , in the party’s leadership primary before Italian
elections, in a bid to become the country’s next prime minister.  “I am trying to change  Italy , not the Democratic Party,”
Renzi, 37, said today in Verona in a speech broadcast by Sky
TG24 television. Italy, led by Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
unelected government, is due to hold national elections by
April.  The leadership challenge comes as the Democratic Party
leads in most opinion polls. Renzi has a higher approval rating
among all voters than Bersani, 60, though Bersani leads among
members of the PD, a Sept. 10 survey by polling company Demos
said.  Renzi, with an approval rating of 42.5 percent, is Italy’s
second-most popular politician after Monti. Bersani registered a
31.8 percent rating, according to Demos. The same poll showed
that among possible voters in a PD primary, 43.5 percent would
support Bersani, while 27.7 percent would support Renzi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
