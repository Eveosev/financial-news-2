Ethanol futures were unchanged in
 Chicago  after four days of declines amid abundant supplies and a
drop in consumption.  Futures matched yesterday’s two-month low after an Energy
Department report showed that the  amount  of U.S. gasoline that
contained ethanol was the smallest in more than eight months
while  stockpiles  climbed to a six-week high and  imports  surged.  “There is no activity here,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “You’re well-
balanced in terms of always having supply out there and demand
that fluctuates on domestic gasoline consumption.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery was unchanged at
$2.42 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
gained 9.9 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  decreased 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.48 a gallon and in Chicago the
biofuel climbed 0.5 cent to $2.41, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows.  Ethanol on the West Coast was unchanged at $2.56 a gallon
and in the U.S. Gulf the additive lost 0.5 cent to $2.47.  Gasoline  demand  last week slid 5.3 percent, Energy
Department data show, while refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast
restart after shutting for Hurricane Isaac.  Ethanol, made mostly from corn in the U.S., is blended with
the motor fuel to stretch supply and meet federal mandates to
reduce dependence on fossil fuels.  Gasoline Spread  Gasoline for October delivery slid 3.94 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.9622 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  The drop in gasoline narrowed its  premium  to ethanol to
54.22 cents from 58.16 yesterday, making the biofuel less
attractive to blend for refiners, which stand to pocket the
difference between the two.  Corn for December delivery rose 4.25 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $7.7375 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, fell 5.2 percent to 2.75 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. They are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
