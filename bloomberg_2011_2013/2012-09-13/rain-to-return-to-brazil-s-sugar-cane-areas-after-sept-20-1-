Sugar-cane growing areas in  Brazil ,
the world’s largest producer, will get rains again starting
Sept. 20 after dry weather helped accelerate the harvest last
month, according to forecaster Somar Meteorologia.  Sugar-cane processing in the center south, the country’s
main growing region climbed 14 percent to a record 46.5 million
metric tons in the second half of August, according to data from
industry group Unica. In the first 15 days of that month, the
so-called crush advanced 14 percent to 44.2 million tons, the
data showed. Above average rains in May and June delayed the
crop, with cane processing for the season through Aug. 31 down
9.4 percent to 307.6 million tons, Unica estimates.  “It has already rained in Parana and  Sao Paulo  yesterday,
with some isolated showers,” Celso Oliveira, a meteorologist at
Somar, said by phone from Sao Paulo today. “After Sept. 20,
rains will return to most areas in Brazil’s center south.”  Wet weather in October may be 10 to 15 percent above
average, while rainfall in September as a whole will be below
average, Oliveira said. The rain may disrupt the sugar cane
harvest starting in the second half of October, he said.  “In recent years, the harvest has become much mechanized
and machines aren’t as efficient as workers, so we may see some
difficulties,” Oliveira said. The soil is expected to be
“soaked” by Oct. 15 and that would make harvesting
challenging, he said.  Raw sugar traded in  New York  jumped 8.2 percent in June and
7.8 percent in July after rain delayed the harvest and shipment
from Brazil. The country is collecting its 2012-13 crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
