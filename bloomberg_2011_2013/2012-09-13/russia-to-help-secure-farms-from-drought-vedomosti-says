Russia’s government will help
farmers boost the area sown with winter grains this season and
protect their crops from future droughts,  Vedomosti  reported,
citing an interview with Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich .  The government will co-sponsor irrigation systems that help
private farmers deal with droughts, Dvorkovich was cited as
saying. He didn’t specify a target for the winter grains sowing
area.  This year’s drought in the country has caused direct damage
of less than 20 billion rubles ($638 million) and the final
estimate may be further reduced, according to the minister. The
drought has been less harmful than that of 2010 and this
season’s crop will be enough to satisfy “all needs,”
Dvorkovich said. Export curbs are “not expedient,” Vedomosti
cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
