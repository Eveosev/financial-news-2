Italy ’s wine production may slide 8
percent this year after drought and heat damaged grapes,
researcher Istituto di Servizi per il Mercato Agricolo e
Alimentara said.  Output may fall to 39.3 million hectoliters (1.04 billion
gallons) from 42.7 million hectoliters in 2011, the Rome-based
group wrote in an online  report  dated yesterday.  Italy was the world’s second-largest wine producer after
 France  last year, according to figures from the International
Organization of Vine and Wine. French production may slump 16
percent this year to 42.9 million hectoliters after frost, hail
and an August heat wave harmed vines and grapes, the country’s
 Agriculture Ministry  reported Sept. 6.  “Drought and heat carry the real blame for the scarcity of
wine in the Italian cellars,” Ismea wrote. “The quality of the
grapes itself promises to be good to excellent, with a sugar
content that is higher than average.”  Production in Veneto, Italy’s biggest wine-growing region,
may slide 12 percent to 7.67 million hectoliters, while output
in Emilia Romagna is forecast to drop 9.8 percent to 5.82
million hectoliters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
