Neuralstem Inc. (CUR) , a biotechnology
company with no approved products, gained the most ever after
saying its stem cell treatment restored paralyzed rats’ ability
to move in an early study.  Neuralstem  rose  38 percent to $1.38 at the close of trading
in New York, its largest single-day gain since the shares first
started trading in December 2006. The Rockville, Maryland-based
company’s stock has gained 43 percent this year.  Researchers severed the spinal vertebrae of 12 rats, then
gave half of them Neuralstem’s stem cells a week after the
injury, according to the study published today in the journal
 Cell . The rats that received the injections gained “significant
locomotor recovery,” according to a company statement.  The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  placed a hold on
Neuralstem’s proposed human trial to treat spinal cord injury in
October 2010, according to a company filing.  “We think that this paper is the last piece of the puzzle
to get the FDA to take our spinal cord injury trial off hold,”
Richard Garr, chief executive officer, said in an interview.  Neuralstem also is testing its therapy in early human
clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as  Lou
Gehrig ’s disease, and for depression.  To contact the reporter on this story:
