Egypt  will “soon” make an
official decision on resuming cotton imports after a seven-month
ban, an official said.  “We haven’t made an official decision yet,” Magdy Al
Issawi, technical head of the Ministry of Agriculture’s central
administration for agricultural chambers, said by phone. “I
hear it will be resumed,” he said without specifying a date.  Daily newspaper Al Borsa reported today that Egypt had
issued a decision to lift the ban on cotton imports imposed in
February to protect the domestic market, citing the industry and
foreign trade minister, Hatem Saleh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
