Indonesia ’s bonds advanced, pushing
the yield on 10-year notes to the least in four weeks, on bets
the central bank will keep borrowing costs at a record low today
to support growth. The rupiah weakened.  The yield on the nation’s bonds maturing in 2022 dropped
for a sixth day as  global funds  added 1.32 trillion rupiah ($138
million) to their local debt holdings in the first two days of
this week, poised to extend inflows for a second week, Finance
Ministry data show.  Bank Indonesia  will leave its  benchmark
reference rate  at 5.75 percent for a seventh month, according to
all 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The decision is due
around noon in Jakarta.  “We expect Bank Indonesia to keep the main policy rate
unchanged to support investment-related credit,” said  Prakriti
Sofat , an economist at Barclays Plc in  Singapore . “Positive
global risk sentiment has helped the bonds.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent notes due May 2022
declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.94
percent as of 9:01 a.m. local time, the lowest level since Aug.
15, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 9,583 per dollar, the most
since Sept. 5, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, held at 5.85 percent, the lowest
level since May 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
