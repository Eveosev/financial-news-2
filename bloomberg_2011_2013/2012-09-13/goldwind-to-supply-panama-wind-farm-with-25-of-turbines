(Corrects to say Goldwind is  China ’s largest turbine maker
in first paragraph.)  Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. (2208) , China’s largest wind-turbine maker by revenue,
will supply Union Eolica Panamena with a quarter of the
equipment it needs for a wind farm in Panama.  Goldwind will supply and install its 2.5-megawatt turbines
at the Penonome wind farm in Cocle province, the turbine maker’s
U.S. subsidiary said today in an e-mailed statement. The company
didn’t give a price or size of the project, which it said will
be the largest in Central America.  The deal is the fourth in  Latin America  for the Urumqi,
China-based company, which has supplied more than 300 megawatts
of turbines for projects outside China. The wind farm is
expected to begin producing electricity next year.  “The Penonome project serves as an important milestone for
Goldwind’s international growth,” Goldwind Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Wu Gang said in the statement.  Union Eolica Panamena is a unit of Granada, Spain-based
Union Eolica Espanola SL, which is planning to build as much as
350 megawatts of wind farms in the country, Rafael Perez-Pire
Angulo, UEE’s director, said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
