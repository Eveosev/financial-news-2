PetroLogistics LP (PDH) , operator of the
only dedicated U.S. propylene plant, is seeking permission to
double the Houston factory’s output as supplies fall and
competitors including  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  plan similar facilities.  PetroLogistics wants to add six combustion units to the
five currently producing propylene, an ingredient in plastics,
nylon and detergents, the Houston-based company said in an
application to the Environmental Protection Agency.  PetroLogistics hasn’t made a final decision on whether to
invest in the project, Chief Executive Officer Nathan Ticatch
said today in a telephone interview. He declined to say when a
decision could be made.  “We are in fact investigating the opportunity,” Ticatch
said. “Others clearly are also looking at the addition of
propylene production capacity.”  PetroLogistics, which raised $595 million in an initial
public offering on May 3, has been making propylene from
propane, a component of natural gas, in Houston since 2010. Dow
and  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  are among companies planning
to open similar facilities by mid-decade because of relatively
low U.S. gas prices and tighter supplies of propylene.  Annual U.S. propylene output has declined as much as 5
billion pounds since 2005 when ethylene makers began switching
from oil to cheaper gas-based feedstocks that yield less
propylene as a byproduct, Charles Neivert, an analyst at Dahlman
Rose & Co. in  New York , said in a Sept. 10 report. He rates
PetroLogistics a buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
