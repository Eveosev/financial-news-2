FirstMerit Corp. (FMER) , the Akron, Ohio-
based lender, agreed to acquire  Citizens Republic Bancorp Inc. (CRBC) 
for about $952 million in stock to expand into Michigan and
Wisconsin.  Citizens’ investors will receive 1.37 shares of FirstMerit
common stock in exchange for each of their shares, the banks
said today in a statement. The deal values Citizens 18 percent
higher than yesterday’s closing price, or about $23.51 per
share.  FirstMerit expects to repay Flint, Michigan-based
Citizens’s $345 million of Troubled Asset Relief Program
preferred stock, including $45 million of deferred dividends.
Following the transaction, FirstMerit will have $24 billion in
assets, $15 billion in loans and $19 billion in deposits,
according to the statement. The move helps FirstMerit expand
into Wisconsin and Michigan and strengthens its presence in
northeast Ohio, according to the statement.  “With a five-state reach that will extend from western
Pennsylvania to Wisconsin, FirstMerit looks to become the bank
of choice among businesses and individuals across the upper
Midwest,” FirstMerit Chief Executive Officer Paul Greig said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
