Polandâ€™s new gas exchange should
handle at least 50 percent of gas volumes sold in the country,
Andrzej Czerwinski, deputy chairman of the economic
parliamentary committee, told  Puls Biznesu .  The initial government proposal was to set the minimum
required limit to 70 percent, the newspaper reported. The new
gas exchange platform, run by Towarowa Gielda Energii SA, will
start early October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
