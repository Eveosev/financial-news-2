Argentina ’s declining debt
obligations will allow the government to tap fewer central bank
reserves in 2013 than the $5.7 billion planned this year, said
Fernando Yarade, deputy chairman of the Finance Committee in the
lower house.  South America’s second-biggest economy faces about $9
billion in debt payments next year, compared with about $11
billion in 2012, Yarade, a member of the ruling Victory Front
coalition, said in a telephone interview today. Yarade said he
had access to an advanced report of the 2013 budget bill, which
must be sent to Congress by tomorrow night.  “The policy to keep cutting the country’s debt will
continue,” Yarade said. “It’s very probable that there will be
an additional inflow of about $10 billion in  export  revenue this
year that will boost central bank reserves.”  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  has tapped central
bank reserves to pay debt since 2010 as Argentina remains
blocked from international credit markets following its default
on $95 billion of bonds in late 2001. Reserves fell to $45.3
billion yesterday, down from $47.8 billion on April 27 and a
record $52.6 billion in January last year.  Officials at the central bank’s and the Economy Ministry’s
press offices declined to comment on the budget proposal.  The central bank transfered about $6.6 billion from its
savings to the treasury to make payments in 2010, $7.5 billion
in 2011 and is scheduled to send $5.7 billion in 2012. Economy
Minister Hernan Lorenzino will discuss the budget with lawmakers
on Sept. 20, Yarade said.  Growth Forecast  The 2013 budget proposal forecasts  economic expansion  of
4.6 percent, more than double the 2.2 percent growth that the
 World Bank  predicted for Argentina in 2012. A rebound of the
Brazilian economy, the country’s main trade partner, and rising
activity in  China ,  Europe  and the U.S. will help improve demand
for Argentine goods, Yarade said.  “The economy will have better international conditions
than this year and that will have a positive impact,” Yarade
said. “The outlook is good taking in mind that the price of
soybeans, wheat and corn are higher and that a better harvest is
expected.”  Argentina is the world’s biggest exporter of  soybean oil 
and the second biggest of corn. It ranks third in shipments of
soybeans and fifth in wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
