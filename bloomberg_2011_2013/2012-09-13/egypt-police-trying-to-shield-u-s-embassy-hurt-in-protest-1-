Protesters set fire to two police
vehicles and injured officers in clashes as authorities tried to
keep demonstrators away from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.  At least 14 police were hurt on the third day of unrest
sparked by a film that ridiculed the  Prophet Muhammad , the
 Interior Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement. The total
number of injuries increased to 16, said Ahmed El-Ansari, vice-
resident of the Egyptian Ambulance Organization. Police also
arrested 12 people.  The protesters closed off one of the streets near the
embassy, the state-run Nile News reported. Overnight, the crowd
of demonstrators built up to several hundred and authorities
fired tear gas to disperse them.  On Sept. 11, protesters scaled the walls of the embassy and
tore down the U.S. flag, replacing it with an Islamic banner. An
attack on the American mission in Benghazi,  Libya  on the same
day killed the U.S. ambassador and three other staff members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
