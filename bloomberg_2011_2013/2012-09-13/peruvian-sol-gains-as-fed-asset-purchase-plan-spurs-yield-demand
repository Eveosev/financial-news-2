Peru ’s sol rose the most in a month
after the  Federal Reserve  said it will expand holdings of
mortgage securities to bolster the world’s largest economy,
fueling demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.5980 per U.S. dollar
at today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.
The sol is trading below 2.60 for the first time since 1997,
 data  from Peru’s financial regulator show.  The U.S. central bank said it will make open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month in a third
round of quantitative easing. Increased demand for riskier
assets will boost demand for the sol and Peru’s short-maturity
bonds, said Hedmond Rios, an economist at Celfin Capital in
Santiago.  “With abundant liquidity in international markets,
investors will try to take advantage of the rate differential
versus  U.S. Treasuries  and greater appreciation in the sol,”
Rios said. The sol will probably trade at about 2.59 in the
“very short term” before returning to levels above 2.60, Rios
said.  Peru’s central bank bought $60 million in the spot currency
market today to stem gains in the sol. The bank said on its
website it paid an average 2.6024 soles per  U.S. dollar .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 4.42 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price rose 0.08 centimo to 122.49 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
