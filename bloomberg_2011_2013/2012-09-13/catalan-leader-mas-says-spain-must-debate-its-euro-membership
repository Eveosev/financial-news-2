Catalan President Artur Mas said
 Spain  should debate staying in the euro as leaders consider
seeking a European bailout, becoming the most senior Spanish
official to question the nation’s single-currency membership.  “If we want to have a serious debate, the first question
has to be whether we want to be in the euro or not,” Mas said
at a conference in  Madrid  today, adding that Catalonia wants to
remain in the single currency. “If you say yes, you have to
accept the rules of this game. You could say no.”  Catalonia, which accounts for 20 percent of the nation’s
economy and is home to some of the country’s biggest companies,
is battling Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  for greater control
over taxes as austerity measures have undermined voters’
willingness to subsidize poorer regions. Mas raised the stakes
this week, saying if Rajoy doesn’t give his administration in
Barcelona greater autonomy, he’ll push for full independence.  Mas said Catalonia and Spain are “tired of each other”
and said the push for a “nation state” is “coming from the
street.” He estimated 1.5 million people demonstrated for
independence at a protest this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
