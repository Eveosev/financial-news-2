Serbian central bank Governor
Jorgovanka Tabakovic said she wouldn’t mind if former bank chief
Radovan Jelasic was appointed as head of the Governor’s Council.  Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  told Belgrade newspaper
Vecernje Novosti in Sept. 12 interview he would like Jelasic,
the head of Erste Group Bank AG’s Hungarian Unit since May 2011,
to chair the five-member Governor’s Council.  “If there are no legal obstacles, central bank Governor
Jorgovanka Tabakovic has no objections to such a proposal,
taking into account” Jelasic’s experience, the Belgrade-based
Narodna Banka Srbije said in an e-mail today.  Jelasic, who served as the National Bank of  Serbia  governor
from 2004 to 2010, said he had no comment on the reports.  Serbia amended its central bank law, establishing
parliamentary control of the institution for the first time
since the ouster of  Slobodan Milosevic  in 2000. As a result, the
former governor, vice-governor and four of five council members
resigned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
