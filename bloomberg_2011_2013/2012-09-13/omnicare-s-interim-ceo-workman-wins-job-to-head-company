Omnicare (OCR)  Inc., a supplier of drugs
to nursing homes, named John Workman the permanent chief
executive officer after he served as interim chief since June.  Workman took over the role when former CEO John Figueroa
left the company on June 11 after several weeks of conversations
with the board. The company didn’t provide a reason for
Figueroa’s departure other than to say that he had accomplished
the goals of his 18-month tenure.  Robert Kraft  was named as the
company’s new chief financial officer.  “We are pleased to announce that after a thorough search
process, the board has chosen John Workman,” James Shelton,
chairman of Covington, Kentucky-based Omnicare, said today in a
statement.  In May, under Figueroa, Omnicare settled a case with the
 U.S. Department of Justice  for $50 million. The agency called it
the “largest controlled-substance settlement in history,” and
said that Omnicare gave nursing home residents medicines without
a prescription, with missing prescription information, or not
documenting prescriptions.  Workman had been Omnicare’s chief financial officer since
November 2009, according to the company. Omnicare  shares  gained
2.4 percent to $34.90 at the close in New York time. The stock
has gained 4.6 percent since he became interim chief.  To contact the reporter on this story:
