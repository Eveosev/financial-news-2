Tyron Smith of the  Dallas Cowboys 
was fined $15,750 by the National Football League for a horse
collar tackle on  New York  Giants linebacker Michael Boley in the
season-opening game, the Cowboys said on their website.  Smith’s tackle -- in which a defender grabs the inside of
an opponent’s shoulder pads from behind and pulls him down --
prevented Boley from scoring a touchdown after he intercepted a
pass from  Tony Romo  in the second quarter of the Cowboys’ 24-17
win on Sept. 5. The Giants took possession at the Dallas 1-yard
line and were held to a field goal.  “It was a way to help my team out,” Smith, the Cowboys’
6-foot-5, 311-pound left tackle, told the  team’s website . “If
you care about the money that much, you’re playing for the
money. I’m playing because I want to.”  The minimum fine for a horse collar tackle is $15,750.
Smith told the Cowboys’ website that he’ll appeal the fine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
