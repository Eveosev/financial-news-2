Indian exports shrank 9.7 percent
in August from a year earlier, Director General of Foreign Trade
Anup Pujari said, as faltering global growth hurt demand.  Merchandise shipments  declined to $22.3 billion last month,
Pujari said at a briefing in New Delhi today as he released
provisional trade data. Imports slid 5.08 percent to $38
billion, leaving a trade deficit of $15.7 billion, he said.  The debt crisis in  Europe  and elevated U.S. unemployment
have hampered overseas sales by  emerging markets  from  India  to
 China . The South Asian nation has taken steps such as increasing
taxes on gold imports to try and narrow the trade shortfall,
which has pressured the rupee.  The U.S. market is showing signs of stabilization, Commerce
Secretary S.R. Rao said at todayâ€™s briefing.  The rupee, which has plunged 14 percent against the dollar
in the past year, weakened after the report and closed down 0.3
percent at 55.415 per dollar.  The drop in the currency has stoked import costs, with a
report tomorrow set to show that inflation accelerated to 7.1
percent in August, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Indian gross domestic product rose 5.5 percent in the three
months through June from a year earlier, a pace close to the
three-year low of 5.3 percent in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
