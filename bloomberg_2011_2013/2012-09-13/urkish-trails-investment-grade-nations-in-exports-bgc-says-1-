Turkish exports as a proportion of
economic output are less than half the ratio of investment grade
countries,  BGC Partners (BGCP)  said.  Exports were “almost flat” at between 15 percent and 18
percent of GDP over the past decade compared with 40 percent for
nations rated investment grade,  Ozgur Altug , chief economist for
BGC in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed report to clients today.  While the biggest achievement of Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government has been to diversify Turkey’s
exports, the “exports to GDP ratio did not improve much in the
last 10 years,” he said.  Erdogan’s government, which is calling on  ratings agencies 
to upgrade the country’s debt rating to investment from junk, is
selling more goods to neighbors in the Middle East and North
Africa after exports to European countries hurt by the financial
crisis declined. A surge in imports last year widened the
current account deficit to a record 10 percent of GDP.  Turkey  should switch to more value-added products and alter
its “production structure,” Altug said.  A surge in exports to Iran “are a natural outcome of the
successful export diversification,” he said.  The share of intermediate goods in total exports climbed to
54 percent in the first seven months from 50 percent in the same
period of 2011, Altug said in the report. The share of
consumption goods fell to 36 percent from 38 percent and of
capital goods to 9.4 percent from 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
