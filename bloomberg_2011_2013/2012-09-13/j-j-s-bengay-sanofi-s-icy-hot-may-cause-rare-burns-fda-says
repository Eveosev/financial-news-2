Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s Bengay and
 Sanofi (SAN) ’s Icy Hot are among topical pain relievers that have been
associated with a rare risk of serious burns, U.S. regulators
said today.  The over-the-counter pain-relieving creams, lotions and
patches are linked to 43 cases of burns on the application site,
the  Food and Drug Administration  said in a  safety announcement .
The cases were identified in a search of the FDA’s adverse event
reporting system and medical literature.  The majority of second- and third-degree burns occurred
with the use of products containing menthol as the single active
ingredient or having both menthol and methyl salicylate, the FDA
said. Few cases involved a capsaicin-containing product.
Patients who experience pain, swelling or blistering of the skin
should stop using the product, the agency said.  “When applied to the skin, the products produce a local
sensation of warmth or coolness; they should not cause pain or
skin damage,” the FDA said in the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
