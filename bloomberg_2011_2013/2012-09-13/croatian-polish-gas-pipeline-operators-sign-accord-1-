Croatia ’s and Poland’s state-owned
natural-gas pipeline operators said they signed a cooperation
accord today that includes an agreement to connect their
liquefied natural gas terminals.  Economy Minister Radimir Cacic told reporters in Zagreb
that Croatia will build a 1.1 billion-euro ($1.4 billion)
project on the island of Krk in the  Adriatic Sea , including an
LNG terminal, estimated at 600 million euros, and a 500 million-
euro gas thermal-electric plant.  Croatia will seek financing from European Union funds to
account for about a quarter of the estimated price, Cacic said.
The country wants to complete the project by 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
