Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  climbed to its  highest level  since the depths of the 2008
financial crisis after the Federal Reserve said it would embark
on another round of quantitative easing.  Berkshire Class A shares rose 2.1 percent to $132,851 at
4:07 p.m. in New York today, the highest since October 2008.
U.S. stocks rallied after Fed policy makers, led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, said the central bank will expand its holdings of
long-term securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of
mortgage debt a month to boost growth and reduce unemployment.  Buffett, 82, has expanded Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire
in the years since the credit crisis with acquisitions including
the 2010 purchase of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for
$26.5 billion. Berkshire’s chairman and largest shareholder also
added to the company’s investment portfolio, buying more than
$10 billion in  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  stock and
purchasing $5 billion in preferred shares and warrants in Bank
of America Corp.  “They’re more diversified now” than they were four years
ago, said  Tom Lewandowski , an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. who
advises clients to buy the stock. “Anything that you see
positive economically is going to be reflective in Berkshire’s
share price.”  Berkshire has climbed about 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
