Raba Nyrt. (RABA) , the vehicle maker in
which the Hungarian government holds a majority stake, rose the
most in 10 months after its executives said they were  buying  the
company’s shares.  The stock rose 15 percent to 769 forint, the biggest jump
since Nov. 8, by the end of trade in Budapest.  Chief Executive Officer Istvan Pinter and deputy CEO Bela
Balog each purchased shares, Raba said. Raba’s first-half
results and current stock of orders point toward further growth
after achieving the best operating result in 10 years in 2011,
according to an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  “The shares may already start rising in the near future
toward levels which better reflect the company’s real position,
exceeding the 1,000 forint mark,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
