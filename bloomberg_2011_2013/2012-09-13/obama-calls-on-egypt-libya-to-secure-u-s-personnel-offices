President  Barack Obama  called the
leaders of Egypt and Libya to request help in securing American
diplomatic offices after attacks in both countries, the White
House said in e-mailed statements.  In a phone call with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi,
Obama “underscored the importance of Egypt following through on
its commitment to cooperate with the  United States  in securing
U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel,” according to one
statement. “The President said that he rejects efforts to
denigrate Islam, but underscored that there is never any
justification for violence against innocents and acts that
endanger American personnel and facilities.”  In his call with Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf, Obama
“said that the Libyan government must continue to work with us
assure the security of our personnel going forward,” according
to a separate statement. “The President made it clear that we
must work together to do whatever is necessary to identify the
perpetrators of this attack and bring them to justice.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
