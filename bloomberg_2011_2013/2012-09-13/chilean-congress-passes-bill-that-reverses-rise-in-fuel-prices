Chileâ€™s Congress approved
legislation that makes the fuel price stabilization program more
flexible, allowing gasoline prices to fall this weekend rather
than increase as expected earlier this week, acting Finance
Minister Julio Dittborn said in a statement last night.  The Senate yesterday passed the legislation with 13 votes
in favor, two against and seven abstentions, Dittborn said in
the statement e-mailed by his press office. The lower house on
Sept. 11 approved the bill with 52 votes in favor, 21 against
and 23 abstentions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
