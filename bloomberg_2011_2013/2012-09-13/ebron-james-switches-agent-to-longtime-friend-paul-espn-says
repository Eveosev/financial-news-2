LeBron James  left agent Leon Rose
and the Creative Artists Agency and will join a newly created
firm led by his longtime friend Rich Paul,  ESPN reported .  The Miami Heat’s James signed in 2005 with Rose, whose
business was purchased by Creative Artists two years later, the
report said. Rose negotiated James’s last two contracts, an
extension with the  Cleveland Cavaliers  in 2006 and a six-year
deal with the Heat in 2010, ESPN said.  James was a teenager when he met Paul, who has been an
agent for a few years and worked under Rose at Creative Artists,
ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
