The economy of the Group of 20
nations grew in the second quarter at the weakest pace since the
start of 2009, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.  The combined economy of the G-20 area expanded 0.6 percent
in the second quarter from the first, when it grew 0.7 percent,
the Paris-based organization said in a report today.  That was the third consecutive quarter of slowdown and the
softest since the first quarter of 2009, when the economy shrank
1.5 percent from the prior period.  The G-20 combines the worldâ€™s leading industrial and
emerging economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
