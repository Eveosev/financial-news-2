Ecuador ’s credit rating was raised
by Moody’s Investors Service, adding to a bond rally that’s sent
benchmark yields to a four-year low, after $7.27 billion of
loans from China shored up the government’s finances.  Ecuador’s sovereign credit rating was raised one step to
Caa1, seven levels below investment grade, with a stable
outlook, Moody’s said today in a statement. Access to loans from
China shores up government finances while its debt load compares
favorably to higher-rated peers, Moody’s said.  The South American country, which forecasts a $4.23 billion
 budget deficit  this year, has relied on rising oil prices and
tax increases to fund  government spending  that’s more than
doubled since 2007, while drawing on loans from China and
multilateral lenders to cover shortfalls since defaulting on
$3.2 billion of international bonds in 2008 and 2009.  “In spite of its lack of access to international  capital
markets  since 2008, after the government defaulted on its 2012
and 2030 Global Bonds, Ecuador has managed to secure significant
amounts of external financing from China,” Moody’s analyst
Sarah Glendon said in the statement. Concerns remain “about the
government’s willingness to pay, particularly in light of its
2008 strategic default, ongoing high levels of social spending,
dependence of government revenues on oil, and limited access to
external financing.”  The yield on Ecuador’s benchmark dollar bonds due in 2015
fell 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 8.32 percent
as of 5 p.m. in Quito, its lowest level since June 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The security’s price
rose 0.43 cent to 102.92 cents on the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
