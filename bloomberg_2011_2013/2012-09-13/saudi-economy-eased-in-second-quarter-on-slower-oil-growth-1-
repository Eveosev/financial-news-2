Saudi Arabia ’s economy expanded 5.5
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the slowest
pace since at least 2010, as  oil prices  declined.  Growth  eased from 5.9 percent in the January-March period,
the nation’s statistics department in the capital,  Riyadh , said
on its website today. The increase in oil and natural gas
earnings slowed to 6 percent from 7.7 percent.  Saudi Arabia’s economy grew 7.1 percent last year, buoyed
by higher oil prices and a government spending spree aimed at
preventing the kind of political unrest that spread across most
Arab countries. Crude plunged 18 percent in the second quarter
of this year, contributing to decline in the Saudi growth rate
even as oil output hit a three-decade high.  Production in the kingdom, which holds the world’s largest
conventional reserves, increased to 9.9 million barrels a day in
May, the highest since 1980, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has maintained production close to that level
every month since.  The petroleum industry accounts for about 45 percent of
Saudi economic output, 75 percent of budget revenue and 90
percent of export earnings, according to the  Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries .  Construction expanded 9.3 percent in the quarter from a
year earlier, the statistics office said. The rate was above 12
percent in the three periods after the outbreak of Arab revolts
in January 2011.  King Abdullah  announced about $60 billion of
additional spending on housing and other social programs last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
