AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, said its wireless division reached a tentative
agreement with the Communications Workers of America in benefit
negotiations for more than 40,000 employees nationwide.  The accord will be submitted to the CWA’s membership for a
ratification vote, Dallas-based AT&T said in a statement today.
The deal is focused on benefits including health care. Wages,
pension and work rules are negotiated under separate contracts.  If ratified, the four-year agreement will take effect Jan.
1 and it covers topics such as health-care premiums and
deductibles.  AT&T and competitors such as  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 
regularly negotiate with unions over new contracts as rising
network investment costs weigh on profit margins. More than half
of AT&T’s employees are represented by CWA, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers or other unions, according to
the company’s  annual report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
