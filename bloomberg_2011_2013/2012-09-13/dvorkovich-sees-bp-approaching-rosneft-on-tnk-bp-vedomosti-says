Russian Deputy Prime Minister
 Arkady Dvorkovich  said  BP Plc (BP/)  may have approached state-run OAO
Rosneft about buying out the British company’s half of the TNK-
BP venture,  Vedomosti  reported today.  Rosneft may have the money and resources for the deal,
Dvorkovich said in an interview with the newspaper. The
government hasn’t held formal discussions with management yet,
and the oil producer hasn’t provided any estimates on the
transaction, which may be worth $30 billion, Vedomosti reported,
citing the deputy prime minister.  Dvorkovich said it’s not advisable for state-run companies
to expand their role in the economy, and government approval is
needed for any deal to go ahead, according to the interview.  Vladimir Buyanov, a spokesman for BP in Moscow, declined to
comment on Dvorkovich’s remarks. He referred to BP’s June 1
statement about pursuing “unsolicited approaches” about its
TNK-BP stake and Rosneft’s July 24 statement that it had begun
talks. Rustam Kazharov, a spokesman for Rosneft, didn’t respond
when Bloomberg called his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
