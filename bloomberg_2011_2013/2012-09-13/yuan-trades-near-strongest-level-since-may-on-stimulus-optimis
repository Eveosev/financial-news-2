China ’s  yuan  traded near the
highest level since May on speculation the government will
implement more stimulus measures to shore up growth in the
world’s second-largest economy.  Domestic banks have been asked by regulators to increase
lending to railways, roads and other construction projects to
support growth, China Securities Journal reported today, citing
an unidentified banker. The People’s Bank of China set the
reference rate 0.03 percent stronger at 6.3338 per dollar,
raising it for a second day. The local currency gained 0.2
percent this week and 0.3 percent since Aug. 31.  “The  renminbi  is back on a slowly appreciating path as
policy makers carry out more stimulus measures,” said  Daniel
Chan , executive vice president at Glory Sky Global Markets Ltd.
in Hong Kong. Still, “policy makers are in a dilemma in terms
of currency policy as a weaker currency supports exporters yet
may stoke inflation.”  The yuan traded at 6.3296 per dollar in Shanghai, compared
with yesterday’s close of 6.3264, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.3225 yesterday, the highest
since May 22. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the  daily fixing .  China should take measures to prevent the economic
conditions of 2010 when inflation reached 6.5 percent, Bank of
China Ltd. Chairman Xiao Gang wrote in a commentary in the  China
Daily . Massive stimulus measures would be “detrimental” to
sustainable economic growth, the official Xinhua News Agency
wrote in an editorial yesterday.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.12 percent
today to 6.4240 per dollar in Hong Kong, a 1.5 percent discount
to the spot rate in Shanghai, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell two basis points to 1.3
percent. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan declined 0.06
percent to 6.3340, snapping a five-day advance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
