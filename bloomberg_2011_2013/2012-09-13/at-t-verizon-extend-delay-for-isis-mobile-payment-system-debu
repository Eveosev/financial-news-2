Isis, the mobile-payment joint
venture backed by  AT&T Inc. (T) ,  Verizon Wireless  and T-Mobile USA
Inc., won’t debut by the end of September as planned, extending
delays for a service once expected to start by the end of June.  Isis will provide an update in October on the revised
timeline to introduce service in two markets,  Salt Lake City  and
Austin, Texas, said Jaymee Johnson, head of marketing for the
venture.  VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  Chief Executive Officer Doug Bergeron said in August that the project, which his company is
participating in, was on track for a September start.  Isis, which will let users pay for items at stores using
their mobile phones, had previously planned to roll out the
service in the first half of 2012. The joint venture tweaked its
strategy last year, opting to use credit-card companies to
handle transactions rather than the carriers themselves, and
it’s taken time to ensure that payments can be made securely.  To contact the reporter on this story:
