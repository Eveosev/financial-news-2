Wayne Rooney ’s overhead kick in last
year’s Manchester derby was voted as the best goal of the
Premier League’s 20 seasons in a public poll.  The Manchester United striker’s acrobatic volley in
February 2011 beat nine other nominated goals with 26 percent of
the 300,000 votes, the  Premier League said  after conducting a
global poll to celebrate the competition’s two decades.  “I grew up watching the Premier League, so to
be voted the best goal in the history of the Premier League is
a great feeling,” Rooney, 26, said on the league’s website.  Dennis Bergkamp’s 2002 goal against Newcastle, where the
Dutchman flicked the ball and spun past a defender in one
movement before placing a shot past the goalkeeper, polled 19
percent ahead of former Arsenal teammate  Thierry Henry ’s flick
and volley against  Manchester United  in 2000.     Awards will also be given for the best match, save, goal
celebration and fantasy team of the league’s 20 seasons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
