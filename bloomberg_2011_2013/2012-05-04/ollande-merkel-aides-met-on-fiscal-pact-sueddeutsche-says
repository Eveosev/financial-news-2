Francois Hollande plans to work
closely with  Chancellor Angela Merkel  if he wins the French
presidency, ending a spat over debt-crisis budget policy, the
German newspaper  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing
discussions between officials.  Minutes taken during talks between Hollande’s advisers and
German officials show that the French presidential front-runner
wants to augment the as-yet unratified fiscal compact treaty
with clauses to spur economic growth rather than water down the
plan, the newspaper said. The amendments might be agreed at a
European Union summit in Brussels at the end of June, it said.  Hollande seeks a “pragmatic solution” to ending the row
over the blueprint, the main aim of which is to commit EU
signatories to cutting their structural deficits in the medium
term to 0.5 percent of gross domestic product. Hollande’s aides
said “unanimously” that his comments on the compact were made
in the context of the presidential campaign, the newspaper said.  Hollande will “definitely adhere” to a goal to cut the
French deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in 2013, the advisers
were cited as saying. “Hollande and his team acknowledged their
commitment to Franco-German cooperation,” it said, citing the
minutes. The newspaper did not say when or where the meeting or
meetings took place.  Related News and Information:
