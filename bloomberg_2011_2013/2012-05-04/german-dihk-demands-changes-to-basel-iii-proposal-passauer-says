A requirement for banks to set aside
more capital for loans to medium-sized companies under proposed
Basel III rules has to be corrected,  Germany ’s DIHK chambers of
industry and trade said,  Passauer Neue Presse  reported.  The requirement is “an unjustified burden” that doesn’t
reflect the comparatively lower risk of loans to medium-sized
companies, DIHK President Hans Heinrich Driftmann wrote in a
letter to German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , the
newspaper reported today.  Driftmann asked Schaeuble to push for changes in
negotiations among the 27  European Union members  later this
month, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
