Outfielder Bobby Abreu has signed with
the  Los Angeles Dodgers  one week after he was released by the
Los Angeles Angels.  The 38-year-old Abreu agreed to a one-year contract,
Dodgers General Manager Ned Colletti said today in an e-mailed
statement. Financial terms of the contract were not disclosed.  A two-time All-Star, Abreu has hit .293 with 284 home runs,
1,330 runs batted in and 393 stolen bases in a 17-year career
with the Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies,  New York  Yankees
and Angels. He was hitting .208 with five RBIs and no home runs
when he was released April 27 after being with the Angels since
2009.  Abreu is the only active player with more than 500 doubles,
250 home runs and 350 steals in his career, according to the
Dodgers. The only others players to reach each of those
milestones in a Major League Baseball career are  Barry Bonds ,
Rickey Henderson and Craig Biggio.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
