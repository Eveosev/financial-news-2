U.S.  states hired  workers for a fourth
straight month in April, while further cuts by  school districts 
pushed local government payrolls to the lowest since late 2005,
the U.S. Labor Department reported today.  States added 1,000 workers to their payrolls last month,
marking the longest stretch of increases since 2008, according
to data released today by the Labor Department thatâ€™s adjusted
to account for seasonal hiring patterns. Local governments,
meanwhile,  eliminated  12,000 jobs.  The employment figures show the differing pace of financial
recovery for state and local governments. While state tax
collections have risen for the past two years, many local
governments are still struggling with budget shortfalls, in part
because of a decline in  home prices  that results in smaller
property tax payments.  The public sector job cuts are a drag on the economic
recovery from the recession that officially ended three years
ago. Overall, employers last month added 115,000 workers to
their payrolls, the smallest gain in six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
