The  International Monetary Fund 
Executive Board released a report today recommending easing
controls on capital flows and calling on  China  and  India  to
speed such financial “liberalization.”  “The IMF staff paper is a further building block in
formulating a comprehensive, flexible, and balanced approach for
the management of capital flows,” the fund said today in a news
release.  The Washington-based IMF said that officials should manage
capital flows during a crisis only as a supplement to
adjustments of government policy.  The G-20 requested that the IMF study capital flows. The
report is the fourth in a series developed by the fund on the
issue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
