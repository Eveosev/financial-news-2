Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the Finnish mobile-phone
maker, was sued by an investor who accused the company of
overstating the benefit of introducing Windows-based
smartphones.  The company led investors to believe that its shift last
year to Microsoft Corp.’s  Windows Phone  would halt a decline in
market share, Robert Chmielinski, the shareholder, said in a May
3 complaint in U.S. District Court in New York. The market share
declined further and Nokia reported worse-than-expected results,
he said in the complaint.  “Nokia’s migration to a Windows platform was not going as
well as represented,” Chmielinski said in the complaint, filed
by attorneys at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP of Melville,
New York.  Chmielinski asked that the case be given class-action, or
group, status to add other plaintiffs who bought shares
from Oct. 26 to April 10. He asked for unspecified damages
plus costs.  Nokia’s shares began trading without the rights to their
dividends today. Excluding the dividend, the stock dropped 3.2
percent to 2.39 euros in Helsinki. Nokia shares have declined 37
percent this year.  “Nokia is reviewing the allegations contained in the
complaint and believes that they are without merit,” the
company said today in a statement. “Nokia will defend itself
against the complaint.”  The case is Chmielinski v. Nokia Corp., 1:12-cv-03511, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
