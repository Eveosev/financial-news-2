California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  weakened against futures for the first time in seven
days on thin trading and after  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  said the
Bakersfield refinery will start this month.  The hydrocracker at the 70,000-barrel-a-day Bakersfield
refinery, idled in December for work and then kept out of
service due to poor refinery cracks, will start this month,
Dallas-based Alon said in a statement late yesterday. The
company said operations at the Paramount refinery in  Long Beach 
resumed last month.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in Los Angeles
dropped 13 cents to 28 cents a gallon above futures traded on
the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:53 p.m. New York time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuelâ€™s premium rose
yesterday to the highest level since Feb. 24 on speculation that
maintenance was forcing refiners to buy fuel off the  spot
market .  Phillips 66 (PSX-W) ,  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)  are
performing maintenance on units at their Northern California
refineries.  San Francisco  Carbob also dropped 13 cents to 38 cents
above gasoline futures.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco slipped
0.5 cent to an 18-cent-a-gallon premium versus Nymex heating oil
futures. The same fuel in Los Angeles also fell 0.5 cent to a
9.25-cent premium.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon , rose
3 cents to 36 cents above gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel
 there  strengthened 4 cents to a premium of 29 cents a gallon
above heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
