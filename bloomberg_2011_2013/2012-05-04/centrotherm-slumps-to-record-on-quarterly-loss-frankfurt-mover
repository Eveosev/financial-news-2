Centrotherm Photovoltaics AG (CTN)  fell to a
record in  Frankfurt  after the German maker of machines for the
solar industry posted a quarterly loss and said it sees no
improvement in the first half.  Centrotherm dropped 18 percent to 5.994 euros at the 5:30
p.m. close, after posting a 42.9 million-euro ($56.3 million)
loss before interest and tax in the first three months of 2012,
compared with a profit of 17.7 million euros a year ago. Sales
fell by half to 82.5 million euros, it said in a statement.  “The numbers are extremely weak and disappointing, and
that’s reflected in the share movement,” Erkan Aycicek, an
analyst with Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, said by phone today.  Solar-cell and panel makers, Centrotherm’s clients, are
under pressure after governments in  Europe  and the U.S. trimmed
subsidies, worsening a glut of the devices that’s already
slashed margins at the top five manufacturers.  Centrotherm booked 255.4 million worth of orders in the
first quarter, including one totaling 227.1 million euros from
Sonelgaz to construct a solar module factory in  Algeria , the
Blaubeuren, Germany-based company said.  “We are not assuming a significant improvement to the
current situation in the first half of 2012,” Chief Financial
Officer Thomas Riegler said. Centrotherm views pricing pressures
in the solar industry as “an opportunity because our customers
are focusing on highly efficient technologies and production
systems that deliver competitive advantages,” Rieger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
