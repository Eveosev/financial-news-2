The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 3 basis points to 166.5 basis
points as of 8:23 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. The gauge is set for its highest close since
April 27, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose 1 basis point to 157
basis points as of 10:26 a.m. in Sydney, National Australia Bank
Ltd. prices show. The index is also headed for its highest close
since April 27, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  Japanâ€™s markets are closed today for a national holiday.
The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index jumped 28.3 basis points to 182.4
in April, the biggest monthly increase since November, CMA
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
