Andritz AG (ANDR)  soared in Vienna trading
after the the world’s second biggest hydropower-turbine maker
beat profit and sales estimates in the first quarter.  Shares rose 3.5 percent to 40 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close
in the Austrian capital, after rising to 41.045 euros earlier in
the day, Andritz’s highest level ever. The company has advanced
25 percent this year, giving it a market valuation of 4.16
billion euros ($5.45 billion).  Andritz said today that net income rose 37 percent to 50.5
million euros after sales jumped 28 percent to 1.19 billion
euros.  Analysts had forecast  net income of 45.3 million euros on
1.05 billion euros revenue, according to estimates collected by
