Thailand’s baht had the biggest weekly
loss this year on speculation importers are stepping up
purchases of the dollar to take advantage of a more favorable
 exchange rate . Bonds dropped.  The currency touched a five-week high of 30.68 per dollar
on May 2 before losing 0.5 percent that day. Imports climbed
25.6 percent in March, the most since September, as companies
replaced machinery damaged in last year’s floods, customs data
showed last week. That contributed to a record $4.59 billion
 trade deficit . The baht has traded between 30.68 and 31.07
against the greenback since March 28.  “With the baht reaching the top of its recent trading
range, importers wanted to buy dollars but exporters seem to be
on the sidelines waiting for the 31 level,” said Kozo Hasegawa,
a Bangkok-based trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
“Declines in the baht were limited as we were seeing some fund
inflows.”  The baht dropped 0.6 percent this week and 0.1 percent
today to 30.96 per dollar as of 3:14 p.m. in Bangkok, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It may trade between 30.75 and
31.05 next week, Hasegawa said. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of foreign-exchange swings used to price options, was
unchanged today and this week at 4.52 percent.  Global funds bought $54 million more local shares than they
sold this week through yesterday and a net $859 million of
government debt, according to data from the stock exchange and
the Thai Bond Market Association.  No More Cut  The yield on  Thailand ’s 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.58 percent
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate
advanced one basis point this week.  Thailand will refrain from further  interest-rate  reductions
the economy is recovering from the floods faster than the
central bank anticipated, Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said.
The central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 3
percent for a second straight meeting on May 2, after two
reductions.  Southeast Asia ’s second-largest economy will probably
expand 6 percent this year, up from a previous estimate of 5.7
percent and a 0.1 percent expansion in 2011, Prasarn said in an
interview with Bloomberg News in  Manila  today, where he is
attending Asian Development Bank meetings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
