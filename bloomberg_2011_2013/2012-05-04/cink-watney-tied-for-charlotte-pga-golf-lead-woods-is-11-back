Stewart Cink  and  Nick Watney  are tied
for the lead during today’s second round of golf’s Wells Fargo
Championship at 11-under par, while  Tiger Woods  is in danger of
missing the 36-hole cut for weekend play.  Cink, the 2009 British Open champion, is 4-under today
through 13 holes, while Watney is 7-under through 12 holes of
his second round at the Quail Hollow Club in  Charlotte , North
Carolina.  Woods, making his first start on the U.S. PGA Tour since
last month’s Masters Tournament, is 1-over par through 11 holes
today after an opening-round 1-under 71. The tournament’s 2007
winner and 14-time major champion had three bogeys and two
birdies through his opening nine holes today.  Ryan Moore, Webb Simpson and Ben Crane trail Cink and
Watney by one shot.  Phil Mickelson , who will be inducted into the  World Golf
Hall of Fame  next week, ended his first round tied with Woods at
1 under. He will begin his second round this afternoon. The 41-
year-old left-hander had four birdies, a bogey and a triple-
bogey over his final nine holes after playing the opening nine
holes in 1 under.  Rory McIlroy, the U.S. Open champion who along with Woods
and Mickelson is playing for the first time since the Masters,
is 4-under for the tournament after three birdies and a bogey
through his opening nine holes today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
