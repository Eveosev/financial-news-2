A majority of Germans support
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s austerity policies for Europe,  Die
Welt  reported today, citing a poll by Infratest Dimap.  Some 55 percent of the population in Germany are in favor
of “stern austerity” in Europe rather than growth programs
financed with new credit, the German newspaper said, citing the
Infratest Dimap poll of 1,004 people taken between April 30 and
May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
