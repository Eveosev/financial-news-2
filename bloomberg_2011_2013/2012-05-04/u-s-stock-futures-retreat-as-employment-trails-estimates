U.S. stock futures retreated after
government data showed employers added fewer jobs than forecast
last month, damping optimism in the economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index expiring next
month fell 0.2 percent to 1,383.3 at 8:46 a.m. in New York.
Before resuming declines, the contract briefly reversed losses
after sliding as much as 0.6 percent immediately after the
report.  Payrolls climbed 115,000, the smallest gain in six months,
after a revised 154,000 rise in March that was more than
initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate of 85 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 160,000 advance. The jobless rate
fell to a three-year low of 8.1 percent and earnings stagnated.  Stocks fell yesterday, sending the S&P 500 down 0.8
percent, as a gauge of  service industries  slid more than
economists had predicted. The S&P 500 has lost 0.8 percent so
far this week, following  two weeks  of gains.  The S&P 500 has rallied 11 percent so far in 2012 and is
trading about 1.9 percent below an almost four-year high reached
on April 2.  The retreat since April 2 has spurred bears to predict the
gauge will mirror retreats of at least 15 percent from April
peaks in 2010 and 2011 as economic growth slows. Birinyi
Associates Inc., Northern Trust Corp. and Wells Capital
Management say increasing investor anxiety is a contrarian sign
that will give way to a rally after record profits left shares
10 percent cheaper than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
