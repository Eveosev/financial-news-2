U.S. stocks slumped, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its biggest weekly retreat this
year, as data on the American and European labor markets boosted
concern the global economy is weakening.  All 10 industry groups in the  S&P 500  fell except for phone
stocks. Gauges for  commodity producers  tumbled more than 3.3
percent as  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  missed earnings estimates and
crude dropped below $100 a barrel for the first time since
February. An  S&P 500 index (SPX)  of technology shares slid 3.8 percent
amid  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s biggest decline since October and  JDS Uniphase
Corp. (JDSU) ’s sales projection that trailed estimates. Sunoco Inc.
surged 23 percent after agreeing to be bought for $5.3 billion.  The S&P 500 fell 2.4 percent to 1,369.10, snapping a two-
week rally and trimming its gain for the year to 8.9 percent.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slipped 190.04 points, or 1.4
percent, to 13,038.27, after the 30-stock gauge climbed on May 1
to its highest level since 2007.  “We’ve been steadily raising cash,”  Frank Ingarra , who
helps manage $1.5 billion at Greenwich, Connecticut-based
NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said in a telephone interview.
“We’ve had a really nice rally. Slower growth in the U.S., as
characterized by the worse-than-expected labor reports, kind of
put a little water on the fire.”  Stocks rose May 1 as manufacturing expanded in April at the
fastest pace in 10 months. Equities retreated during the next
three days as optimism over global growth faded amid more data
that disappointed investors. U.S. employers added fewer jobs
than forecast, the American service sector slowed and euro-
region unemployment rose to a 15-year high. The jobs report on
the final day of the week sent the S&P 500 tumbling 1.6 percent.  Turning Negative  The benchmark index has dropped 3.5 percent from a four-
year high on April 2 amid concern weaker economic reports would
help spur a repeat of losses that began in May during the last
two years. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S., a
gauge of how much reports differ from economists’ estimates in
Bloomberg surveys, turned negative on April 25 and fell May 3 to
the lowest level since September. Last year, the gauge sank
below zero for the first time in five months on May 2, the day
when the S&P 500 began a 19 percent drop.  Jim Paulsen , chief investment strategist for Wells Capital
Management, said he doesn’t expect the market to mirror retreats
of 2010 and 2011.  “There is no doubt that the reports have weakened a little
bit compared to where they have been,” Paulsen, who helps
oversee about $333 billion from Minneapolis, said in a May 3
phone interview. “But I don’t really look at the reports as
telling me that we’re failing again.” He sees the S&P 500
advancing to 1,500 this year, a 9.6 percent rise from its
current level.  Earnings Season  The benchmark index has more than doubled from a 12-year
low in March 2009 as the  Federal Reserve  announced measures to
stimulate the economy and  corporate earnings  beat estimates.
About 70 percent of S&P 500 companies that reported results
since the start of the earnings season have topped projections,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Energy shares in the S&P 500 slumped 3.3 percent for the
week as crude prices fell. Marathon Oil tumbled 9.8 percent to
$26.80. The oil producer reported first-quarter earnings
excluding some items of 67 cents a share, trailing the average
analyst estimate by 23 percent, the most since 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  slipped 9 percent to $14.45.
The second-largest U.S. coal miner cut its forecasts for full-
year shipments and capital expenditures after posting a second
straight quarterly loss as demand and prices slumped.  Sealed Air, Apple  Sealed Air Corp. (SEE)  led raw-materials companies in the S&P 500
to a 3.5 percent loss. The packaging manufacturer sank 8.1
percent to $17.69 after earnings missed analysts’ estimates for
a third straight quarter.  Apple slumped 6.3 percent to $565.25. The world’s most
valuable company has  retreated  11 percent from its record high
on April 9. It is still up 40 percent for the year.  JDS Uniphase dropped 11 percent to $11.09. The maker of
fiber-optic testing equipment forecast fiscal fourth-quarter
sales of $435 million at most, trailing the average analyst
estimate of $458 million in a Bloomberg survey.  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  tumbled 14 percent,  the most  in
the S&P 500, to $52.89. The second-biggest U.S. life insurer
posted a first-quarter loss as the value of the company’s
derivative contracts fell.  Losses in Europe  General Motors Co. (GM)  slid 5 percent to $22.36. The world’s
largest automaker said first-quarter profit slid 61 percent on
widening losses in  Europe .  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)  plunged 48 percent, the
most ever, to $25.10. The company said profit this year will be
less than it previously expected amid the slowest sales growth
in five years. It’s seeing more competition from private-label
capsules that fit into Keurig machines and from Starbucks Corp.,
which plans to sell its own single-serve brewer later this year.  Sunoco (SUN)  jumped 23 percent to $50.23 for the biggest advance
since October 2008. The Philadelphia-based refiner agreed to be
acquired for $25 in cash and 0.5245 common units of Energy
Transfer Partners LP.  -- Editors:  Jeff Sutherland , Nick Baker  To contact the reporter on this story:
