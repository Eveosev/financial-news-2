Lonza Group AG (LONN) , the Swiss maker of
pharmaceutical ingredients which acquired Arch Chemicals Inc.
for $1.2 billion in October, has begun process of selling Arch’s
performance chemicals business, which had sales of about $150
million in 2011.  “The process has started, but we do not disclose at what
stage we are,” Chairman Rolf Soiron said on a conference call.
Soiron could not disclose the exact timing for the divestment.
“Ideally it would be yesterday,” he said. “It takes two to
tango. We would like to have three to tango,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
