(Corrects currency in the headline)  Christian Baha, the founder of
Superfund Asset Management GmbH, said assets inside of of his
managed future funds fell to $820 million, Vienna’s Format
magazine reported, citing an interview.  Twenty-one of the Baha’s 22 funds lost money last year,
Format reported. Superfund had managed as much as $2 billion of
investments in its funds, according to the magazine.  “Times for trend-following funds are definitely very
difficult at the moment,” Baha said in the interview.
Intervention by Swiss and Japanese officials in  currency markets 
damaged Superfund’s profitability, he said.  Baha, an Austrian who splits time between  Los Angeles ,  New
York  and  Monaco , is preparing to move into a 50 hectare (124
acre) Swiss farm in Thurgau after it is renovated in three
years, according to Format. He is investing in precious metals,
and has bought a cattle ranch in  Uruguay , along with farmland in
Romania and  Serbia , he told the magazine.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
