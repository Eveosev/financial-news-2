South Korea ’s won fell for a second
day and  government bonds  advanced as a report showed  service
industries  in the U.S. expanded less than projected, dimming the
outlook for exports to the world’s largest economy.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management said yesterday its
non-manufacturing index fell to a four-month low of 53.5 in
April, while data today may show payrolls climbed by 160,000
after a 120,000 gain in March, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey. The Bank of  Korea  will probably keep
its  benchmark   interest rate  at 3.25 percent for an 11th month at
a review next week, a separate survey showed. The Kospi Index of
shares dropped for a second day.  “With weak data from the U.S., the won is halting its
recent appreciation,” said Yun Se Min, a Seoul-based currency
trader at Busan Bank. “Investors may clear their short
positions on the dollar ahead of the U.S. jobs data today.” A
short position is a bet an asset will decline.  The won weakened 0.2 percent to 1,131.50 per dollar at the
close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the
week, it advanced 0.3 percent. One-month implied volatility for
the won, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, climbed 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to
7.30 percent today.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 dropped two basis points to 3.42 percent, Korea Exchange
Inc. prices show. That’s the lowest rate since Feb. 28. For the
week, the rate fell five basis points. Three-year debt futures
climbed 0.07 today to 104.35 and the one-year interest-rate swap
slid one basis point to 3.47 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
