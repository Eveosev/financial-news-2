Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO) , the fourth-
largest supplier of seaborne  iron ore , is “working on a number
of opportunities” in West Africa to add new sources of revenue
to its main mine.  Kumba would reconsider involvement in the Faleme project in
Senegal, which it exited in 2007 after the government awarded it
to  ArcelorMittal (MT) , should the asset become available, Chief
Executive Officer Chris Griffith said in an interview today in
Centurion, north of Johannesburg.  Senegal last year started arbitration proceedings at the
International Chamber of Commerce against ArcelorMittal, the
world’s largest steelmaker, claiming slow progress in developing
Faleme. Kumba, which produced 94 percent of its ore at Sishen in
South Africa last year, targets as much as 20 million metric
tons of annual output from West Africa by 2020.  Kumba is looking for iron ore in West Africa in a joint
venture with its majority shareholder  Anglo American Plc. (AAL)   The iron-ore market is expected to be stronger in the
second half of the year than the first, with iron-ore prices
remaining steady in the quarter ending June, Griffith said.  Kumba declined 3.5 percent to 528 rand at the 5 p.m. close
in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
