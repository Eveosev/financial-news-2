Soccer club Uniao de Leiria said it
will have to quit  Portugal’s top division  after 13 players
submitted resignation letters over late salary payments.  The resignations will force last-place Leiria to withdraw
from the 16-team championship, the club said on its  Facebook 
page. A club official confirmed the comments.  Uniao de Leiria  would face automatic relegation and a fine
if it doesn’t take the field for a game at Benfica scheduled to
start at 8:30 p.m. tomorrow.  Only eight Leiria players showed up for its last game on
April 29, a 4-0 loss against Feirense.  Leiria may sue some players for “very grave sports and
financial damages,” according to its Facebook page.  Editors: Alex Duff, Bob Bensch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
