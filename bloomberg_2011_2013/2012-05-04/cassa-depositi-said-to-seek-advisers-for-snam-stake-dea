Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA,  Italy ’s
state-owned lender, is seeking bids from investment banks to
advise it on  Eni SpA (ENI) ’s sale of a stake in gas distributor  Snam  (SRG) 
SpA, according to two people familiar with the transaction.  Investment banks must submit proposals to the Rome-based
lender, which is Eni’s biggest shareholder, by midday May 7,
said one of the people, who declined to be identified because
the talks are private. Cassa Depositi may seek a direct stake in
Snam, the people said. A spokeswoman for Cassa Depositi declined
to comment on the matter.  Cassa Depositi’s Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Gorno Tempini said April 18 that the bank is studying Snam as a
potential investment.  Eni is preparing to sell its 6.5 billion-euro ($8.5
billion) holding in Snam after Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
government earlier this year ordered the spinoff to increase
competition and reduce consumer prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
