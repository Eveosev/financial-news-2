Equal Energy Ltd. (EQU) , an oil and natural-
gas producer with assets in  Canada  and the U.S., gained the most
in seven months after saying it’s considering options including
a sale of the company.  Equal Energy rose 11 percent to C$3.34 at 10:30 a.m. in
Toronto. The Calgary-based company earlier  gained  more than 14
percent, the most intraday since Sept. 27. The shares had fallen
59 percent in the last year through yesterday.  Equal Energy has formed a special committee of directors,
and options include a sale of the company, divesting assets, a
merger or acquisitions, it said in a statement yesterday after
the close of regular trading.  “The board of directors believes that the company’s shares
trade at a significant discount to the value of the underlying
assets,” it said. The process wasn’t a result of any particular
offer, Equal Energy said.  The special committee has hired  Bank of Nova Scotia  to
advise it. It hasn’t set a definite schedule to complete the
process, the company said.  Equal Energy’s shares have been trading at a “significant
discount” to its net asset value, Kevin Shaw, a Calgary-based
analyst at Casimir Capital Ltd., said in a telephone interview.  “I don’t disagree with what the Equal board is doing,” he
said. “It’s a sizeable company, they’ve got some decent cash
flows and, their gas-assets aside, their oil assets are worth
considerably more than their current trading price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
