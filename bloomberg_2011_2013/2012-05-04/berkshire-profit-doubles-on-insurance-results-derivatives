Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  said first-
quarter profit doubled as insurance units and Chairman  Warren Buffett ’s derivative bets posted better results.  Net income climbed to $3.25 billion, or $1,966 a share,
from $1.51 billion, or $917, a year earlier, when the company
faced claims from an earthquake and tsunami in  Japan , Berkshire
said today in a statement.  Buffett increases the volatility of results by guarding
companies against losses from the largest natural disasters, a
 risk  he’s willing to take because insurance units gives him
funds to invest, especially when catastrophes are less severe.
Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s profits also fluctuate based
on the performance of stock indexes including the  Standard &
Poor’s 500  after Buffett used derivatives to bet on equities.  There weren’t “any catastrophe losses that were of note,
outside of some tornado activity” in the first quarter,  Tom Lewandowski , an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis ,
said in a phone interview before results were announced.
Worldwide, claims from natural disasters were “nothing like we
had last year with Japan,” he said.  Stock Purchases  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose in
the quarter to $176 billion from $164.9 billion at the end of
2011. Berkshire’s Class A shares have risen 6.3 percent this
year in New York, trailing the 8.9 percent gain in the S&P 500.  The value of the equity portfolio climbed to $89.1 billion
from  $77 billion  on Dec. 31 as American Express Co.,  Wells Fargo
& Co ., International Business Machines Corp. and  Munich Re 
rallied. Berkshire spent $3.4 billion on equities and sold $820
million in the quarter. The company bought fixed-maturity
securities for $2.1 billion and sold $1.1 billion of the assets.  The insurance segment posted an underwriting profit of $54
million compared with a loss of $821 million a year earlier,
Berkshire said. The company had “no significant losses” from
catastrophes in the three months ended March 31, compared with
$1.1 billion after tax a year earlier, according to a regulatory
filing today.  The gain from equity-index puts rose to $689 million in the
three months ended March 31 from $223 million a year earlier.
Gains from credit-default contracts, in which Buffett, 81, bets
on the ability of borrowers to repay debt, increased to $340
million from $70 million.  Derivative Bets  Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman, chief executive officer and
largest  shareholder , sold equity derivatives to undisclosed
buyers for $4.9 billion in 2006 and 2007, when markets were near
their peaks. Liabilities on the bullish bets narrow when four
equity benchmarks rise. The  S&P 500   climbed 12 percent  in the
three months ended March 31 while another benchmark covered by
the contracts, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, surged 19 percent.  First-quarter results include a $337 million impairment
related to bonds of Texas Competitive Electric Holdings, a unit
of Energy Future Holdings Corp. Berkshire wrote down holdings
tied to Energy Future by $390 million last year and $1 billion
in 2010 and may record further losses, Buffett said in February.  Operating earnings, which exclude some investment results,
were $1,615 a share, missing the average $1,780  estimate  of
three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Burlington Northern  Santa Fe  contributed $701 million to
quarterly earnings, compared with $607 million a year earlier,
as shipments of  consumer goods  and industrial products rose. The
railroad said in a separate filing today that it will pay a $750
million distribution to its parent this month.  Cash Hoard  Berkshire paid $26.5 billion in 2010 for the 77.5 percent
of the railroad it didn’t already own. Buffett is “on the
prowl” for large acquisitions after record earnings at
Berkshire’s railroad and energy units helped boost the company’s
 cash hoard  to $37.3 billion at the end of 2011, the billionaire
investor said in a letter to shareholders in February. The cash
pile climbed to $37.8 billion as of March 31.  Utility unit MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. added $338
million to Berkshire’s earnings compared with $301 million a
year earlier. Pretax earnings from Marmon Holdings, a
manufacturer of construction materials, increased to $269
million from $222 million.  The Berkshire segment with other manufacturers posted $815
million in profit, compared with $444 million, after Buffett’s
purchase last year of Lubrizol, the maker of engine additives.
Without Lubrizol, the division’s earnings would have climbed by
$72 million, Berkshire said.  Annual Meeting  Buffett, under pressure to demonstrate Berkshire is
prepared for a transition, told investors in the letter that the
company’s board had picked his eventual successor as CEO. He
didn’t identify who it was or a timeline for the switch. He also
said there are “two superb back-up candidates.”  The CEO said April 17 that he has stage 1 prostate cancer
that is “not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in
any meaningful way.” Buffett plans to begin a two-month
treatment of daily radiation in July. The regimen will restrict
his travel during the period and not otherwise change his daily
routine, said Buffett. The company’s annual meeting is scheduled
for tomorrow in Omaha.  To contact the reporters on this story:
