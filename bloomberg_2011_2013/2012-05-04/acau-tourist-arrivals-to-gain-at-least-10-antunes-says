Macau’s  tourist arrivals  will increase
at least 10 percent this year from 2011’s 28 million, led by
visitors from mainland  China , said João Manuel Costa Antunes,
director of the city government’s tourism office.  Tourist visits from  Europe  will gain more slowly than the
average due to the continent’s economic woes, Antunes said in an
interview in  New York  yesterday. Total arrivals gained 12% last
year, according to the Chinese city’s statistics agency.  The growth forecast projects a faster increase than in
March, when visits gained 7.3 percent on year to 2.35 million,
with tourist numbers from China rising 15 percent to 1.44
million. April revenue from casinos in the city, the only place
in China where they are legal, jumped by 22 percent to 25
billion patacas ($3.1 billion), according to the government.  Antunes said he expects the number of hotel rooms in the
city to increase to about 50,000 in five years from 23,000 now,
based on the number of projects in the pipeline he expects to be
completed. He declined to comment on individual developments.  Macau needs the added rooms because its hotel occupancy
rate averages about 85 percent and it can be difficult to find
vacancies during the weekends, Antunes said.  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , a unit of billionaire  Steve Wynn ’s Las
Vegas  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) , this week won a land grant for its
second Macau resort, obtaining a 51-acre site on the Cotai strip
where it has said it plans to build a casino and about 2,000
hotel suites.  The company’s existing casino on the Macau peninsula opened
in September 2006.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) ,  Sands China
Ltd. (1928)  and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  also plan Cotai projects
or expansions to draw more Chinese tourists.  Gambling companies are investing in resorts that combine
shopping centers, entertainment shows and hotel rooms to draw
Chinese visitors to Cotai. The strip of reclaimed land is
envisioned by casino operators to be the Asian equivalent of the
 Las Vegas Strip .  To contact the reporter on this story:
