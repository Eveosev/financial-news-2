JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s second-largest
poultry producer, is leasing Brazilian plants from France’s
Groupe Doux to increase chicken-processing capacity 15 percent
as it seeks to diversify from beef.  JBS, based in Sao Paulo, said it won’t assume any debt
under the accord with Chateaulin, France-based Doux, according
to a regulatory filing today. It didn’t disclose the value of
the deal.  JBS only trails  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  in poultry production
after buying control of  Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC)  in the U.S. for $800
million in 2009. It became the world’s largest beef producer
after acquiring Swift & Co. in 2007 and two  Smithfield Foods
Inc. (SFD)  units in 2008.  In February, JBS leased four slaughterhouses in Brazil from
Guapore Carnes. Last month it acquired two beef plants in
northern Brazil for an undisclosed amount and said it was
offering to buy some assets or a controlling stake in Cajamar,
Brazil-based Independencia SA for 268 million reais.  JBS shares rose 0.7 percent to 7.48 reais at 11:02 a.m. in
 Sao Paulo . The Bovespa stock index fell 0.5 percent.  The company is creating a unit to run its poultry business
in Brazil and named James Cleary as the division’s chief
executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
