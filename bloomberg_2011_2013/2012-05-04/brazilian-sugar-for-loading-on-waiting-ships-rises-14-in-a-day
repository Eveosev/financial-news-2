The amount of sugar to be loaded on
ships waiting at main ports in  Brazil , the world’s largest
producer, rose 14 percent in a day as rains continued to disrupt
operations, according to SA Commodities.  Vessels were waiting to load 815,000 metric tons as of
yesterday, the Santos, Brazil-based consultancy said in an e-
mailed report, a 100,000-ton gain from May 2. Rains at the end
of last month are seen reducing the amount of sugar cane crushed
in April’s second half and cutting sucrose levels for cane to be
processed in this month’s first half, Antonio de Padua Rodrigues, technical director of industry group Unica, said in a
statement yesterday.  “Sugar operations at the port of Santos remain alternating
on and off according to the weather,” Luiz Carlos dos Santos
Jr., head of sugar brokerage and operations at SA Commodities,
said in the report. He cited “rains still present all over the
coast and jeopardizing loading.”  Santos is the biggest port in Brazil, which also is the
leading global exporter of sugar.  Mills in center south, which produces about 90 percent of
the country’s sugar and ethanol, processed 4.74 million tons of
cane from the 2012-13 season in April’s first half, down from 7
million a year ago, Unica said yesterday. About 70 mills were
operating by April 15, against 113 a year earlier, according to
the group.  The number of mills already crushing cane from the new
season came to 126 by May 1, down from 212 last year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
