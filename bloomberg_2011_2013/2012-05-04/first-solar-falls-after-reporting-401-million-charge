First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest
maker of thin-film solar panels, fell to a record low after
reporting a $401 million restructuring charge yesterday related
to firing 30 percent of its workforce.  First Solar  fell  6.3 percent to $16.94 at the close in New
York, the lowest since going public in November 2006. The shares
have declined 50 percent this year. The Tempe, Arizona-based
company reported yesterday a first-quarter net loss of $449.4
million, or $5.20 a share.  A global glut of solar panels combined with cuts to
government subsidies in the U.S. and  Europe  have driven down
 prices  for solar panels 48 percent in the past year. The company
announced March 17 it would would fire 2,000 employees worldwide
and close a plant in  Germany .  First Solar raised its 2012 earnings-per-share forecast
yesterday, to a range from $4.00 to $4.50 a share, from an
earlier forecast of $3.75 to $4.25.  That boost is due mostly to one-time cost savings from the
restructuring, according to Aaron Chew, an analyst with Maxim
Group LLC in  New York .  While the increase “may spark hope a recovery is at hold,
this owed solely to the $50 million to $60 million in expected
2012 restructuring savings,” he said in a research note today.
With panel pricing continuing to slide, earnings “guidance may
still be at risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
