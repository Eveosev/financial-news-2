French Socialist presidential
candidate  Francois Hollande â€™s lead over President  Nicolas Sarkozy  narrowed following a televised debate, two polls showed.  Hollande now has the support of 53.5 percent of voters,
down from 55 percent in an April 24-25 poll, while Sarkozy has
the backing of 46.5 percent, up from 45 percent, according to a
TNS Sofres poll conducted for i-Tele television channel.  An Ipsos survey showed a lead of 52.5 percent to 47.5
percent for the Socialist, with Hollande ceding half a point to
Sarkozy in a week.  Both polls were conducted yesterday after Sarkozy and
Hollande conducted a 170-minute televised debate the previous
evening.  TNS Sofres interviewed of 1,000 voters, giving it a margin
of error of 3.1 percent. Ipsos interviewed 1,018 voters. No
