Federal Reserve policy isn’t designed
to prop up U.S. stock prices as many people believe, according
to  David Einhorn , president of Greenlight Capital LLC.  “The real Fed put is under the  bond market ,” the hedge-
fund manager wrote in a commentary yesterday on the Huffington
Post website. He was referring to a  put option , which sets an
asset’s minimum price for a later sale.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, stocks and bonds have often
moved in opposite directions during the past three months. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a Treasury note and bond index,
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies, were used in the comparison.  “The Fed has all but guaranteed that it will do what it
takes to stop bond prices from falling” by promising to keep
its target interest rate near zero through 2014, according to
Einhorn, based in  New York .  The Bloomberg/EFFAS index was 0.2 percent higher for the
year through yesterday after rebounding from losses in February
and March. Those declines followed gains in January that lifted
the indicator to a record.  Central bankers don’t understand investor psychology,
Einhorn wrote. “If you want to get people to sell bonds and buy
stocks, the best way to do that is to show them that bond prices
can, and do, fall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
