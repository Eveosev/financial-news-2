European stocks  declined, extending
their weekly drop, as a government report showed U.S. employers
added fewer jobs than forecast in April.  Hays Plc (HAS)  and  Randstad Holding NV (RAND)  led losses in recruitment
companies, sinking more than 5 percent.  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , the
world’s second-biggest maker of solar-grade silicon, slumped 6.1
percent after net income dropped.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , a U.K.
homebuilder, slid 7.7 percent as the nation’s  house prices  fell
the most in 1 1/2 years.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Rio Tinto  Group
led mining companies lower.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  retreated 1.8 percent to 253 at
the close of trading, the lowest level since April 23. The
benchmark gauge tumbled 2.4 percent this week, trimming its 2012
advance to 3.5 percent, as  Spain  entered a recession and reports
on U.S. business activity and services-industry growth trailed
economists’ forecasts.  “The U.S. labor-market report will further erode investor
confidence,” said Markus Allenspach, head of bond research at
Julius Baer Group Ltd. in Zurich. “The financial market can
digest one or two negative surprises, but if the negative
surprises become the rule and not the exemption, as it is the
case now, investors are fast in reducing their positions.”  Thirteen companies in the Stoxx 600 were trading without
the right to the latest dividend payment today, dragging the
index 0.38 points lower, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The volume of shares changing hands was 3.2 percent
greater than the 30-day average.  U.S. Payrolls  U.S. payrolls climbed by 115,000 last month, the smallest
gain in six months, after a revised 154,000 increase in March
that was more than initially estimated, Labor Department figures
showed today. The median estimate of 85 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 160,000 advance.  The jobless rate fell to a three-year low of 8.1 percent as
people left the  labor force .  In Europe, four elections this weekend have the potential
to reshape the region’s political map and show how the response
to the financial crisis remains hostage to the whims of voters
on both sides of the region’s economic divide.  Recession-weary Greeks will pick a new government and polls
show the French will probably elect the first Socialist
president since 1995. Local elections will test Italy’s
political pulse, and voters in a northern German state may deal
a symbolic blow to Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition.  ‘More Uncertainty’  “Elections in Europe will not bring support to the markets
in our view as their outcomes will probably carry more
uncertainty,” said Jean-Paul Jeckelmann , chief investment
officer at Banque Bonhote & Cie. in Neuchatel,  Switzerland .
“The news flow in  Europe  has been poor in the last few weeks.
That gives market participants the opportunity to take some
chips from the table and stay on the sidelines until we get a
clearer view on what’s really going on.”  Euro-region services and manufacturing output contracted
more than initially estimated in April, adding to signs the
economy is struggling to regain strength. A  composite index 
based on a survey of purchasing managers in both industries
dropped to 46.7 from 49.1 in March, London-based Markit
Economics said today. That’s less than an estimate of 47.4
published on April 23. Readings below 50 indicates contraction.  Hays slid 8.4 percent to 83.35 pence in  London , the biggest
drop since 2008, and Randstad lost 5.2 percent to 24.28 euros in
Amsterdam.  Michael Page International Plc (MPI)  retreated 5.4 percent
to 385 pence.  Wacker Chemie  Wacker Chemie tumbled 6.1 percent to 59.80 euros, the
largest decline in two months. First-quarter net income dropped
to 40 million euros from 168 million euros a year ago. The
company said it sees its 2012 earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization “markedly” below its 2011 level.  Taylor Wimpey, the U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by
volume, dropped 7.7 percent to 47.69 pence, the steepest fall
since August.  Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) , the biggest, sank 7.5
percent to 124.3 pence.  U.K.  house prices  dropped the most in 1 1/2 years in April
as a stamp-duty exemption for first-time buyers ended and the
economy fell into its first double-dip recession since the
1970s, according to Halifax. Prices declined 2.4 percent from
March, the mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc said.  BHP Billiton , the world’s biggest mining company, decreased
3.9 percent to 1,918 pence and Rio Tinto fell 4.4 percent to
3,214.5 pence as a gauge of basic-resources companies was the
worst performer among the 19  industry groups  in the Stoxx 600
today.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  slid 3.1 percent to 1,131.5 pence.  Debenhams Declines  Debenhams Plc (DEB) , the U.K.’s second-biggest department-store
company, lost 5.9 percent to 80.4 pence, its first retreat in
eight days, as Liberum Capital Ltd. downgraded the shares to
sell.  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME) , the owner of the Argos and Homebase
chains, slipped 2.5 percent to 81.25 pence. The stock plunged 24
percent this week, the biggest drop since the company was split
off from GUS Plc in 2006, after saying on May 2 that it won’t
pay a final dividend.  Belgacom SA (BELG) ,  Belgium ’s largest telephone company, advanced
1.3 percent to 21.76 euros after first-quarter profit of 199
million euros beat the average 194 million-euro analyst
estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
