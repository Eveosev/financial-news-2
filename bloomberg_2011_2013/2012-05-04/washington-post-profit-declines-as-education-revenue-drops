Washington Post Co. (WPO) , the publishing,
television and college-preparation company, fell the most in six
months after shrinking enrollment at its education business
dragged down first-quarter profit.  The shares dropped 4.9 percent to $357.62 at the close in
New York, the biggest one-day decline since Oct. 31. The shares
have fallen 19 percent in the past 12 months.  First-quarter income from continuing operations fell 40
percent to $10.8 million, or $1.37 a share, from $17.9 million,
or $2.21, a year earlier, the Washington-based company said
today in a statement. The drop was partly attributed to the sale
of Kaplan’s EduNeering unit in April, the company said. Revenue
fell 6.7 percent to $972.5 million.  The Kaplan business, which accounted for  59 percent  of
annual revenue last year, has come under government scrutiny --
along with the rest of the for-profit education industry.
Enrollment at Kaplan University and higher-education campuses
fell 18 percent from a year earlier.  Washington Post newspaper’s ad revenue dropped 17 percent
to $52.7 million from a year earlier as the broader newspaper
industry continues to suffer declines in print advertising. The
newspaper’s average weekday circulation fell 9.8 percent to
492,600. Washington Post’s website and its Slate property didn’t
stave off those print losses, with revenue sliding 7.7 percent
to $24.2 million in the period.  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the company’s
largest outside shareholder, with 27 percent of outstanding
shares, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
