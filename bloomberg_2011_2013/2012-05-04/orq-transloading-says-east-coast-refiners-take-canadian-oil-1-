Torq Transloading , a Calgary-based
company that loads oil onto trains in  Alberta  and Saskatchewan,
says East Coast Canadian and U.S. refiners are investing in
infrastructure to receive oil by rail.  “East Coast refiners have made the largest investment in
rail cars and rail car offload capacity,” Chief Executive
Officer Jarrett Zielinski said in a telephone interview. Torq,
which loads 18,000 to 24,000 barrels a day of oil onto trains
for shipment to refining centers in the U.S. and  Canada , expects
the amount to double this year.  About 65 percent of the shipments are undiluted bitumen,
Zielinski said. “The balance would be some light sweet.”  Torq has loading terminals in Dollard, Unity and
Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, and in Tilley, Alberta. Three more
will be added within 60 days, including one in Whitecourt,
Alberta, and one in the Tribune, Saskatchewan-area, according to
Zielinski. He declined to disclose the location of the third.  Crude is sent to refiners in Texas City, Texas, on the U.S.
Gulf Coast, to the U.S. Northeast and to Saint John,  New
Brunswick , he said. Irving Oil Corp. operates a 298,000-barrel-
a-day  refinery  in Saint John.  NuStar Energy LP (NS)  may more than triple rail shipments of oil
to its 74,000-barrel-a-day Paulsboro asphalt refinery in New
Jersey within a year, Chief Executive Officer Curtis Anastasio
said in an interview May 2. The amount may rise to 30,000
barrels a day from 7,500 now, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
