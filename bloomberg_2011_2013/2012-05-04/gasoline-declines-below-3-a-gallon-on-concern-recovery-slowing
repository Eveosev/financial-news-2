Gasoline slid below $3 a gallon for
the first time since February as slower-than-estimated U.S. job
growth and signs of contraction in  Europe  raised concern that
global fuel demand will decline.  Futures sank to a 12-week low and crossed a key technical
indicator as U.S. employers added fewer workers than forecast in
April and the jobless rate fell as people left the labor force.
Euro-region services and manufacturing output contracted more
than initially estimated in April, indicating a deepening
economic slump.  “The jobless rate improved a little bit because of lack of
people participating,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in Chicago. “But there’s concerns about the
slowdown everywhere and it is making the supply side look very
heavy.”  Gasoline for June delivery declined 7.42 cents, or 2.4
percent, to settle at $2.9758 a gallon on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since Feb. 10.
Gasoline lost 7.2 percent this week. It’s the biggest weekly
loss since September and follows a 6.1 percent decline in April.  The front-month contract slipped below the 100-day moving
average for the first time since Jan. 3.  “That has been considered the big trend changer when it
falls below the 100-day,” said  Michael Smith , president of T&K
Futures & Options in Port Saint Lucie,  Florida . “Gasoline has
peaked for the year and will probably come back down to $2.50
levels.”  Gasoline last settled below $2.50 on Dec. 19. The price has
retreated 13 percent since reaching $3.4166 on March 26.  Payroll Gain  Payrolls climbed 115,000, the smallest gain in six months,
after a revised 154,000 rise in March that was more than
initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed. The median
estimate of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
a 160,000 advance.  The jobless rate fell to a three-year low of 8.1 percent
and earnings stagnated. The participation rate, which indicates
the share of working-age people in the  labor force , fell to 63.6
percent, the lowest since December 1981, from 63.8 percent.  “The less-than-expected growth rate and more people
leaving the work force is indicative of the potential for
continued stagnant demand for petroleum products,” ’’ said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  U.S. gasoline demand over the four weeks ended April 27 was
4.7 percent below a year earlier, according to an Energy
Department  report  released May 2.  Index Declines  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries dropped to 46.7 from 49.1 in March,
London-based Markit Economics said today. That’s the fastest
rate of decline since October and below an estimate of 47.4
published on April 23. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Gasoline also fell on speculation that supplies will be
ample for the summer driving season as a refinery on the East
Coast and several in Europe get new owners with plans to keep
them in operation.  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  subsidiary Monroe Energy LLC said
April 30 that it agreed to buy the  ConocoPhillips (COP)  operation in
Trainer,  Pennsylvania . Conoco planned to shut the 185,000-
barrel-a-day plant unless a buyer surfaced by the end of May.
Delta plans to add capacity.  ‘Off Table’  A Vitol Group venture agreed yesterday to buy  Petroplus
Holdings AG (PPHN) ’s refinery in Switzerland as Gunvor Group Ltd.
prepared to start operations at its Antwerp plant in Belgium
that’s newly acquired from cash-strapped Petroplus. European
refiners are the largest source of gasoline imports into New
York Harbor.  “The supply risk is off the table now,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in New York. “On the demand side, everything is suggesting the
global economy is continuing to weaken.”  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.1
cent to $3.802 a gallon yesterday, the lowest level since March
14, according to AAA. Prices have dropped 13.4 cents since
reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4. Prices peaked in 2011
at $3.985 on May 5.  “AAA is comfortable saying that we hit our peak for the
first half of the year on April 5, a full month before and at 5
cents cheaper than last year’s peak,”  Michael Green , a
spokesman for AAA in  Washington , said in an e-mail.  June-delivery heating oil fell 7.81 cents, or 2.5 percent,
to settle at $3.0088 a gallon on the exchange, a 15-week low.
Prices lost 5.4 percent this week, the largest weekly retreat
since Sept. 23.  -- With assistance from Nidaa Bakhsh in  London , Mario Parker in
