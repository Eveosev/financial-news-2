Economy Minister Luis de Guindos
didn’t discuss seeking European aid for Spanish banks with
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn , a
spokeswoman for the ministry said, denying a report on website
El Confidencial.  The two also didn’t talk about a vehicle for getting bad
loans off the balance sheets of Spanish lenders, said the
spokeswoman who declined to be identified in line with
government policy.  De Guindos met with Rehn as well as other policymakers who
had gathered yesterday for a meeting of the  European Central
