China  increased its crude imports in
the first quarter to fill stockpiles and not because of growth
in domestic demand, according to a report in China National
Petroleum Corp.’s online newsletter.  China’s crude-processing capacity expanded by 3 percent in
the first quarter, much slower than the annual growth rate of as
much as 12 percent from 2006 to 2010, CNPC  said  today in the
newsletter. The nation boosted oil imports amid geopolitical
tension to ensure long-term  energy security , it said.  “It shows that China is concerned about the instable
global oil market,” according to the report. “China will have
more crude-storage facilities coming online later this year and
early next year. Crude imports in the first quarter were
probably just the tip of iceberg.”  China, the world’s second-biggest oil consumer, imported
70.6 million metric tons of crude in the first three months, up
11 percent from a year earlier, according to customs data. The
nation’s diesel-consumption growth this year will be lower than
output growth, the report also said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
