JBS SA (JBSS3) , which became the world’s
largest beef producer through more than 10  acquisitions  in the
past five years, said it wants to make more purchases as it bets
on increased profit margins in the beef sector.  “We are looking into small, opportunistic acquisitions in
 Brazil ,” Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista, 42, said today
in a telephone interview from  Porto Alegre , Brazil. “Beef
margins are expected to improve and we want to be ready for the
new cycle.” He didn’t disclose the amount to be spent.  Beef margins are expected to rise because of declining
cattle prices in Brazil, he said. Acquisitions should be
financed with cash, said Batista, who took over as CEO at the
Sao Paulo-based company in February 2011.  JBS agreed today to lease Frangosul poultry plants in
Brazil from Groupe Doux for an undisclosed amount. Last month,
it bought two beef plants in the north of the country and
offered to buy bankrupt Brazilian meat packer Independencia SA
for 268 million reais ($139 million). In February, JBS leased
four slaughterhouses from Guapore Carnes.  JBS shares fell 1.2 percent to 7.34 reais at the close in
 Sao Paulo . The  Bovespa (IBOV)  stock index slumped 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
