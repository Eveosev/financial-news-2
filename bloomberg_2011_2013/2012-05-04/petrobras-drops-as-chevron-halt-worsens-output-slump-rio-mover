Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, fell to the lowest in more than
six months after a production halt by its partner  Chevron Corp. (CVX) 
contributed the lowest domestic output since August.  Petrobras fell 5.1 percent to 20.31 reais at 3:54 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo . Earlier it fell to 20.20 reais, the lowest since Oct.
26. Petrobras is down 3.5 percent for the year, compared with a
7.9 percent gain in the benchmark stock index. Oil fell below
$100 today in New York for the first time since February.  Oil production in Brazil fell to 1.99 million barrels a day
in March, the lowest level in eight months, after Petrobras shut
three production platforms for maintenance and Chevron suspended
output at the Frade field to study recent oil leaks, Petrobras
said in an e-mailed statement today. Petrobras’s output rose at
the slowest pace since 2007 last year on equipment delays.  Petrobras has a 30 percent stake in Frade, which was
producing about 60,000 barrels a day before the halt on March
18. Chevron is studying the geology of the Frade field in deep
waters of the Campos Basin to determine the causes of two oil
spills since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
