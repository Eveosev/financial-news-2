U.K. rapeseed prices will probably
come under pressure around harvest time as production outpaces
domestic demand, U.K. grain cooperative Openfield said.  The U.K. may have an exportable surplus of rapeseed of more
than 600,000 metric tons, the trader wrote in a weekly  market
report  on its website. The country’s growers historically sell
40 percent or more of their rapeseed crop at harvest, it said.  “This will likely lead to harvest price pressure as there
are insufficient homes to cope with the tonnage,” Colsterworth,
England-based Openfield wrote.  Long-term price prospects are positive because European
Union rapeseed production is expected to fall by more than 1.1
million tons, meaning the bloc will be the world’s largest
importer of the oilseed for a third year, Openfield said.  “This puts heavy reliance on imports from the Ukraine and
 Australia ,” the trader wrote. “This, coupled with the lack of
South American soybeans, should see vegetable-oil prices
supported long-term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
