Kit Digital Inc. (KITD)  fell to a record in
Prague trading after the online video software maker missed its
quarterly sales estimates and said its full-year guidance was
too “high.”  The stock plunged 12 koruna, or 13 percent, to 83.7 koruna
at 3:49 p.m., its lowest level since the company listed in
Prague in January 2010. After a detailed review of earnings the
management concluded its guidance was too “high”, Chief
Executive Officer Barak Bar Cohen said in a statement yesterday.
The company plans to publish revised guidance on May 15,
together with first-quarter results, he said.  “The news is clearly negative and shows that management
has not been honest with investors over the earnings performance
and development,” J&T Banka AS’ analyst team, led by Milan Vanicek, wrote in a note to clients today.  The company reiterated on March 15 that it expects 2012
revenue to be between $320 million and $330 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
