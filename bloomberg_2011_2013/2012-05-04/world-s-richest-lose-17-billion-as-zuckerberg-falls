The world’s 40 richest people lost a
combined $17 billion this week as concerns about American jobs
and European manufacturing drove global equities to their
biggest weekly loss of the year.  Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson’s fortune fell by $775 million
during the week as shares of his Nevada-based  Las Vegas Sands
Corp. (LVS)  dropped 3.11 percent through May 4. The 78-year-old is the
11th richest person in the world, with a net worth of $24.8
billion, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  “There’s renewed economic concern in light of the
continuing slowdown in Europe, political uncertainty due to the
upcoming elections in France, and the possibility of reopening
discussions on debt rescue packages,” John Carey, who helps
oversee about $220 billion at Pioneer Investment Management
Inc., said in a telephone interview from his Boston office.  Global markets retreated this week after U.S. employers
added fewer jobs than forecast and services and manufacturing
output in the euro region shrank more than estimated. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 2.44 percent to 1,369.10, its
worst weekly decline of the year. The STOXX Europe 600 lost 2.36
percent to close at 253.00.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  co-founder Mark Zuckerberg’s estimated
fortune dropped $2.9 billion after the company said it planned
to sell 337.4 million shares for $28 to $35 each in an initial
public offering May 17. At the upper end of that range,
Zuckerberg’s stake would be $17.6 billion.  Crystallizing Zuckerberg  Zuckerberg’s cut of Facebook, the world’s most popular
social-networking site, had been valued at $20.5 billion based
on trading of the company’s stock in private markets.  The 27-year-old will sell 30.2 million shares in the public
offering, according to a regulatory filing. Most of the proceeds
will be used to pay taxes associated with the exercising of 60
million Facebook options. He ranks 36th on the index.  “However the IPO plays out, it will crystallize
Zuckerberg’s personal net worth,” Jack Ablin, chief investment
officer of Chicago-based Harris Private Bank, said in a
telephone interview. “He’s now set to become Silicon Valley’s
next big billionaire.”  Three candy heirs joined the index this week. Forrest E.
Mars Jr., John Mars and Jacqueline Mars each own one-third of
Mars Inc., the world’s second-largest confectionery, which they
inherited from their father, Forrest Mars Sr. Each is worth
$19.6 billion.  Fontbona, Bezos  Iris Fontbona, the matriarch of Chile’s richest family,
lost $1.6 billion during the week after shares of copper
producer  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the family’s most valuable holding,
fell 11 percent.  The company announced May 3 it experienced a 13 percent
drop in first-quarter output from the previous three months
because of a disruption at its Esperanza mine in northern Chile.
Fontbona is worth $17.3 billion.  Jeff Bezos , founder of Amazon.com, the largest web
retailer, lost $277 million during the week as shares of the
world’s largest online retailer fell 1.26 percent in New York.
The 48-year-old overtook  Google Inc. (GOOG)  founders  Larry Page , 39,
and  Sergey Brin , 38, to become the third-richest technology
billionaire after Google shares dropped 2.93 percent.  Larry Ellison , 67, chief executive officer of Redwood City,
California-based  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , lost $969 million as the
company’s shares fell 2.84 percent in  New York  trading. He is
worth $36.1 billion.  Four Richest  Carlos Slim , 72, remains the world’s richest man with a net
worth of $73.8 billion. He was the week’s biggest gainer, adding
$818 million to his fortune as shares of his mobile-phone
company America Movil SAB rose 4.77 percent as the company
struck a deal with Mexico’s Federal Competition Commission to
avoid paying a fine of almost $1 billion. The company agreed to
cut wireless fees and offer calls to competitors for no extra
change.  Bill Gates , 56, ranks second on the list with a net worth
of $62.2 billion. Behind him is  Warren Buffett , 81, who is worth
$45.4 billion, up $369 million during the week. The Berkshire
Hathaway chairman is preparing for the company’s annual
shareholder’s meeting in Omaha, Nebraska this weekend.  Ingvar Kamprad , the 85-year-old founder of the Ikea retail
empire, is Europe’s richest man with an estimated net worth of
$41.7 billion. Kamprad maintains control over the business
through a network of holding companies and legal entities
established more than 30 years ago.  World’s Tallest Tower  Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s fortune has increased
18.2 percent, or $3.2 billion, this year, as shares of his
 Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , a diversified investment group that is
planning to build the world’s tallest tower, rose 36.2 percent
year-to-date. The 57-year-old ranks 25th on the index with a net
worth of $20.5 billion.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
