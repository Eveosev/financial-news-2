Dangote Flour Mills Plc (DANGFLOU) , a Nigerian
producer, headed to the highest in more than a month on
speculation the company will sell a stake to foreign investors.  The stock rose 4.9 percent to 4.74 naira as of 1:35 p.m. in
Lagos trading, matching yesterday’s gain and set for the
strongest close since March 28.  “The stock is rising because of news that Dangote plans to
sell 80 percent of its food business to foreign investors,”
Adedoyin Adelakun, a Lagos-based analyst at Vetiva Capital
Management, said by phone today, without naming the potential
investors.  Dangote Flour expects a 78 percent increase in profit
during the fourth quarter of its 2011 fiscal year, it said on
Jan. 5. Net income will be 4.84 billion naira (30.1 million) for
the three months through December, up from 2.72 billion naira a
year earlier, the Lagos-based company said in a statement.  Calls today to Antony Chiejina, a spokesman for Dangote,
weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
