The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
declined for a second day, dropping 0.4 percent to 34,235.19 by
10:26 a.m. in Johannesburg. The index has retreated less than
0.1 percent this week.  The following were among the most active equities in the
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  , the South African bank controlled
by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , gained for a second day, adding 1.4 percent to
163.37 rand, a record. The bank hired Kennedy Bungane, formerly
head of Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s corporate and investment
banking unit, to run its African operations and those of
Barclays.       AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , the world’s third-largest
producer of the metal, slid for a fourth day, dropping 0.9
percent to 255.80 rand. Gold declined after the  European Central
Bank  refrained from providing more stimulus, curbing demand for
the metal as an alternative asset.  Astral Foods Ltd. (ARL)  , a chicken producer, fell the
most in more than three months, sliding 3 percent to 121 rand.
Profit fell as much as 19 percent in the first half through
March, the company said in a trading statement today.  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  , the country’s fourth-largest
lender, advanced to the highest on record, rising 0.9 percent to
174.03 rand. Net interest income increased 12 percent to 4.77
billion rand ($616 million) in the three months through March
compared with a year earlier, the company said in a quarterly
trading update today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
