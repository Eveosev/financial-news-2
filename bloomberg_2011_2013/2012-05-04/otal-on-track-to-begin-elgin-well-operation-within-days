Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-largest oil
producer, said it’s “on track” to begin a well intervention
operation to plug a North Sea gas leak in the coming days.  The monthlong gas leak has shut production at the Elgin and
Franklin fields and cost the company 50,000 barrels of oil a
day. Total’s three platforms at the Elgin and Franklin fields
are about 240 kilometers (150 miles) east of Aberdeen,  Scotland .  The West Phoenix semi-submersible drilling rig has moved
within the exclusion zone at the Elgin gas field alongside the
platform. It will be used to pump heavy mud into the well to
stop the leak.  The start of the operation will be subject to continuing
favorable weather conditions, Paris-based Total said today in a
statement.  Total is also drilling two relief wells, which will
intercept the well and make it possible to pump more heavy mud
into the formation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
