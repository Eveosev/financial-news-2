Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
Britainâ€™s biggest taxpayer-assisted lender, said first-quarter
profit rose about 4 percent, beating analyst estimates as losses
at its legacy-asset division fell.  Group operating profit rose to 1.18 billion pounds ($1.91
billion) from 1.13 billion pounds a year earlier, the 82 percent
government-owned bank said today in a statement. Analysts
predicted a profit of 917 million pounds, according to the
median estimate of six surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
