Russia ’s  inflation  rate fell to a
post-Soviet low in April as prices for grains and vegetables
fell from a month earlier.  Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent in April from a year
earlier, compared with the previous record of 3.7 percent in the
previous two months, the Moscow-based Federal Statistics Service
said in an e-mailed statement today. The median forecast of 15
economists in a Bloomberg  survey  was 3.7 percent. Prices rose
0.3 percent from March.  The decrease puts Russia, the world’s largest energy
exporter, closer to its target of keeping inflation between 5
percent and 6 percent following a record-low 6.1 percent last
year. While delayed increases to utility prices and a strong
harvest are still restraining prices, monetary policy is also
playing a role, according to  Ivan Tchakarov , chief economist at
 Renaissance Capital  in Moscow.  “The central bank, unfortunately in my view, is giving
much more weight to inflation concerns rather than to growth
concerns,” he said.  Core inflation , which strips out some volatile items, was
0.4 percent in the month, the statistics service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
