China said  Chen Guangcheng  could apply
to study abroad, hours after the blind rights activist appealed
to President  Barack Obama  and Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
for help to visit the U.S.  “Chen Guangcheng at present is in a hospital getting
treatment,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said
according to a statement. “If he wants to study abroad, he can
like any Chinese citizen go through proper channels and relevant
departments and procedures according to law.”  Liu’s comments were posted on the website of China’s
Foreign Ministry as an increasing number of Chinese government,
police and military vehicles, as well as the car of U.S. Deputy
Chief of Mission Robert Wang, showed up today at the Beijing
hospital where Chen was admitted May 2 after a six-day stay at
the U.S. embassy.  After agreeing to a deal in which he would stay in  China ,
Chen later expressed fears for his family’s safety, saying he
wanted to leave China to rest “for a little while.”  “What it looks like is the Chinese central government is
making at the very least symbolic moves to attempt to address
U.S. government concerns about the fears of Chen Guangcheng
about his and his family’s safety,” Phelim Kine, senior Asia
researcher for New York-based Human Rights Watch, said in a
phone interview.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
