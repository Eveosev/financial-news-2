Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.13 percent to 0.17 percent,
within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.08 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.15 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.
ICAP’s monthly average is 0.155 percent.  The central bank will sell Treasuries maturing from August
2012 to February 2013. The sales are part of the Fed’s program
to replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs
further and counter rising risks of a recession.  The central bank plans to sell from $8 billion to $8.75
billion of securities today, according to the  New York  Fed’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
