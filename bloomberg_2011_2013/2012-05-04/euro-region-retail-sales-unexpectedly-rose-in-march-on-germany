European  retail sales  unexpectedly
increased in March as consumers in  Germany  and France helped
offset slumping demand in the region’s periphery nations.  Sales rose 0.3 percent from February, when they slipped 0.2
percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. Economists had forecast unchanged sales, according
to the median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. From a
year earlier,  sales  fell 0.2 percent.  Germany has helped bolster Europe’s economy as falling
unemployment encourages consumer demand. While governments from
Spain to Italy are toughening spending cuts to plug their budget
gaps, European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
yesterday that he sees a “gradual” economic recovery in 2012.  German retail sales advanced 0.8 percent in March from the
previous month, when they fell 0.9 percent, today’s report
showed. France and Austria reported monthly gains of 0.9 percent
and 1.9 percent, respectively. In Spain, sales fell 0.5 percent
from February, with Portugal’s decreasing 2.2 percent.  The statistics office didn’t release data for  Greece .  To contact the reporter on this story:
