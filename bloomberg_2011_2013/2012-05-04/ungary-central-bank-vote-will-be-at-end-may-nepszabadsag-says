Hungary’s parliament will vote on
amendments to the central bank law , a condition for starting
bailout talks, at the end of May, meaning negotiations won’t
start until June,  Nepszabadsag  reported, citing an unidentified

the European Union on a  credit line  won’t be reached before the
autumn, the newspaper cited the official as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
