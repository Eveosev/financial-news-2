Believe You Can with jockey Rosie
Napravnik aboard won the $1 million  Kentucky  Oaks at Churchill
Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.  Napravnik today became the first female jockey to win the 1
1/8-mile Oaks for fillies, the featured race on the day before
the running of the 138th Kentucky Derby.  “It’s unbelievable,” said Napravnik, who lost her Derby
mount when Mark Valeski was withdrawn this week. “I can’t even
tell you what I’m feeling right now. This is what it feels like
when your dreams come true.”  Believe You Can, a 13-1 bet in the 14-horse field, paid
$29.60, $11.80 and $6.40. Broadway’s Alibi returned $6 and
$4.20, and favorite Grace Hall paid $3.20 to show. The 3-year-
old covered the distance in one minute, 49.50 seconds.  Trainer Larry Jones got his first Oaks win since 2008, when
Proud Spell crossed the finish line first. The following day,
his  Kentucky Derby  entry, Eight Belles, broke down after running
second and was euthanized.  “I’m not going to bring up a lot of things in the past,”
Jones told reporters. “We celebrated for 24 hours. At that
point, we kind of forgot we had won the Oaks. We’re going to
enjoy this one.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
