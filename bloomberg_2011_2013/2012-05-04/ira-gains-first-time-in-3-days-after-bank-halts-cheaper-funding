The lira strengthened for the first
time in three days and bond yields climbed after the Turkish
central bank withheld funding at its lowest rate for the first
time since April 17.  The currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 1.7551 per dollar
at 4:41 p.m. in Istanbul, pushing gains in the week to 0.3
percent. The  yield  on two-year benchmark debt rose 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 9.44 percent, the biggest
advance since April 10. The bank today sold 3 billion liras
($1.7 billion) in its one-week repo auction at 10.7 percent and
2.4 billion liras in overnight repo auction at 11 percent.  The central bank’s move to refrain from lending at the
lower rate comes a day after a government report showed
 inflation  accelerated to 11.1 percent in April from 10.4 percent
in the previous month, the highest yearly rise in 3 1/2 years,
on account of higher food and energy costs. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of seven economists was for an advance to
11 percent.  “The central bank declared today as an exceptional day to
minimize the more-than-expected April inflation’s impact on
pricing behavior,” Ali Cakiroglu, a strategist at  HSBC Private
Bank  in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed comment.  Turkey ’s central bank varies its funding rate on a daily
basis, maintaining borrowing costs within a 5.75 percent to 11.5
percent interest-rate corridor introduced last year. Days when
the bank does not lend at the 5.75 percent rate are considered
“exceptional days.”  “The lira interest rates are really attractive,” Tufan Comert, a strategist at Garanti Securities in Istanbul, said in
an e-mailed comment. The lira can advance to 1.7 against the
dollar this summer, he said.  The inflation rate this month is of “critical importance”
and it will chart a “volatile course” in the coming months
before beginning a narrowing trend, the Ankara-based central
bank said today in a statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
