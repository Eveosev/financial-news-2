Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN) , the biggest
natural-gas producer in Arkansas’ Fayetteville Shale, fell the
most in more than three months after results from a new oil
project didn’t meet some expectations.  Southwestern, based in Houston,  dropped  7.2 percent to
$28.73 at the close in  New York , the biggest decline since Jan.
11.  The company provided an update after yesterday’s market
close on its work in the Lower Smackover Brown Dense formation
of Arkansas and Louisiana. Southwestern said its second well in
the area had a top 24-hour producing rate of 301 barrels of oil
a day and 1.7 million cubic feet of gas a day.  “It’s not up to market expectations of what it could have
been,” said  Scott Hanold , an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in
Minneapolis, who has an outperform, or buy, rating on
Southwestern shares and owns none.  It’s too early to say if the project has economic
viability, Hanold said. Well results show potential, he said,
while more work needs to be done.  Southwestern is exploring for oil in the Brown Dense and in
the Denver-Julesburg Basin in  Colorado  as gas futures have
touched 10-year lows this year. The company’s goal is to
understand the potential at Brown Dense and in Colorado by the
end of the year, Chief Executive Officer Steve Mueller said on a
conference call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
