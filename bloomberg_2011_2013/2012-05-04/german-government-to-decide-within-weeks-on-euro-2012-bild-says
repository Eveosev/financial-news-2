German officials will decide in the
coming weeks whether to attend the European soccer championship
in Ukraine as jailed ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is on a
hunger strike over claims of abuse, Bild am Sonntag reported,
citing an interview with Interior Minister  Hans-Peter Friedrich .  The decision will depend on the evolution of the situation
there, Friedrich told Bild. Threats of economic consequences
against Germany if it boycotts the European  soccer tournament 
shouldnâ€™t be overestimated, the German newspaper cited Friedrich
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
