Mariano Rivera ,  Major League
Baseball ’s saves leader, suffered a potentially career-ending
torn ligament in his right knee before the  New York Yankees ’ 4-3
loss at the  Kansas City Royals  last night.  Rivera was injured while catching fly balls in center field
during batting practice at Kauffman Stadium. The 42-year-old was
driven from the field on a cart before being taken to a hospital
for a scan, which revealed a torn anterior cruciate ligament,
manager  Joe Girardi  told reporters.  “If that’s what it is, I’ve never seen anyone come back,”
Girardi said. “This is bad, there’s no question about it.”  Rivera hinted during spring training that he may end his
18-year major league career when his $30 million, two-year
contract expires at the end of this season. He told reporters
then that he’d made his decision about his future with the
Yankees, although he didn’t disclose it. He declined to say last
night if the injury might force his retirement.  “At this point I don’t know,” the 12-time All-Star said.
“It all depends on how the rehab is going to happen, and from
there, we’ll see.”  Rivera will return to  New York  to be examined by Yankees
doctors. Girardi said he hadn’t decided on who would fill the
closer’s role.  “I haven’t really thought that far out,” he told
reporters. “I’ll sleep on that and decide what I’m going to
do.”  David Robertson  is the probable replacement, according to
the Yankees website. The right-hander has yet to allow a run in
11 games out of the bullpen this season, striking out 18 in 11
innings.  ‘Freak Thing’  As Rivera rolled on the ground in pain holding his knee
last night, teammate  Alex Rodriguez  was seen on television
saying, “Oh my God.” Girardi then ran across the outfield to
the relief pitcher and helped him onto the cart.  “It seems like a freak thing,” Yankees shortstop  Derek Jeter  said in a televised interview. “I’m no doctor, but I
wouldn’t be surprised to see him back this year.”  Rivera got his record-setting 602nd save in a 6-4 win
against the  Minnesota Twins  on Sept. 19. During his career,
spent entirely with the Yankees, he has a 76-58 record with 608
saves and a 2.21 earned run average.  Only Rivera and  Trevor Hoffman  have more than 500 saves and
the closest active player, 36-year-old Francisco Cordero of the
 Toronto Blue Jays , is 279 behind Rivera.  Rivera, who trots into games at Yankee Stadium to
Metallica’s “Enter Sandman,” has had no prior significant
injuries.  Gift From God  The foundation of his success is a cut fastball that can
break bats, a pitch he’s called a gift from God.  Rivera has shown little sign of decline as he ages. He had
ERAs of 1.40, 1.76, 1.80 and 1.91 from 2008-11, and is 1-1 with
five saves and a 2.16 ERA in nine games this season.  Rivera, who also holds first place among active players in
games played with 1,051, has had eight seasons with at least 40
saves, while he and Eric Gagne are the only relievers with two
50-save campaigns.  In helping the Yankees win five  World Series  titles, Rivera
has totaled a record 42 postseason saves, more than twice as
many as any other pitcher. He has an 8-1 record and 0.71 ERA in
a record 96 career playoff appearances.  Rivera was named World Series Most Valuable Player in 1999
and American League Championship Series MVP in 2003.  Rivera is a member of the “Core Four” along with  Andy Pettitte ,  Jorge Posada  and Jeter, who steered the Yankees to
four World Series championships from 1996-2000.  First to Join  The son of a Panamanian fisherman, Rivera was the first of
the quartet to join the Yankees, on Feb. 17, 1990. The others
followed within a two-year span.  Pettitte, who went to Houston from 2004-06, announced his
retirement in February 2011. The pitcher, who had a 240-138
record over 16 years, returned to sign a minor-league contract
with the Yankees this year.  Catcher Posada retired at the end of last season with a
.273 career batting average, 275 home runs and 1,065 runs batted
in.  Jeter, who hasn’t mentioned retirement, leads active
players with 3,128 hits, placing him 19th on the career list. He
has an American League-best 40 hits this season.  In last night’s game,  Kansas City  (8-16) took the lead in
the second inning on a Mike Moustakas home run. The Yankees (13-
12) tied it in the next inning on a double by  Mark Teixeira 
before the Royals regained the lead in the bottom of the third
on a run-scoring single from Eric Hosmer.  Moustakas added a two-run single in the fifth before the
Yankees got their last two runs on sacrifice flies from Eduardo Nunez and Teixeira in the sixth and seventh innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
