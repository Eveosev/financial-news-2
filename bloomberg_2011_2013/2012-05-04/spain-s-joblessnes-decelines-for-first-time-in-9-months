Registered unemployment in  Spain , home
to a third of the euro region’s jobless, fell in April for the
first time in nine months on hiring for the Easter holiday
period.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits
dropped by 6,632 to 4.74 million after an increase of 38,769 a
month earlier, the Labor Ministry in Madrid said in an e-mailed
statement today. Of the three economists in a Bloomberg  survey ,
one predicted an increase of 6,000, while the others forecast a
decline of 15,000 or 60,000.  Spain’s  unemployment rate , the highest in the European
Union, rose to 24.4 percent in the first quarter as the economy
entered its second recession since 2009. Joblessness threatens
to derail efforts to rein in the deficit and quell the region’s
debt crisis, keeping 10-year bond yields close to 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
