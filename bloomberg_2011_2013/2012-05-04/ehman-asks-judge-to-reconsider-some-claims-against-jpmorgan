Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. asked a
judge to reconsider his dismissal of some claims in an
$8.6 billion lawsuit against  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , saying
“hundreds of millions of dollars” might be gained for the
defunct firm’s creditors if it had the right to pursue the
funds, according to a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
