Markus Brunnermeier, a professor of
economics at  Princeton University , said governments will have to
agree on some form of common euro-area bonds to solve the debt
crisis, die Welt reported, citing an interview.  “The fiscal compact can’t break the vicious cycle driving
the  European debt crisis ,” Brunnermeier told the newspaper.
“Euro bonds will come in one form or another, even though
politicians don’t want to admit that yet.”  Together with eight European economists, Brunnermeier
proposes that a European debt agency, financed by bonds
guaranteed by euro-area members, could buy a share of euro-area
countries’ debt, die Welt said.  This would end capital flight from distressed countries,
Brunnermeier said. At the same time, governments would still
have to sell new debt at market rates so that incentives to
manage their finances prudently remain in place, he told die
Welt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
