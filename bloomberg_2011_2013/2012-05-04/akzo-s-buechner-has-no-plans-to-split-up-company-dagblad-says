Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA)  Chief Executive Officer
Ton Buechner has no plans to split up the company, separating
its coatings and specialty chemicals businesses, he said in an
interview in Het Financieele Dagblad.  Akzo has ’’good, strong’’ positions in both markets,
Buechner, who became CEO April 23, said, according to the
newspaper. The company hasn’t made a decision on the future of
its unprofitable U.S. Decorative Paints unit, the newspaper
added, citing Buechner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
