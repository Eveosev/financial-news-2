The U.S. plans to charge additional
defendants in an alleged $1 billion pension disability scheme
among retired  New York  commuter railway workers, an attorney for
the government said.  Ten new defendants will be added to those charged last
year, Danya Perry, a lawyer with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in
Manhattan, said in court today. The government plans to file a
superseding indictment and the investigation is continuing, she
said.  The U.S. in October  charged  11 people, including two
doctors, with participating in a scheme that went back to 1998
in which Long Island Rail Road workers claimed to be disabled
upon early retirement so they could collect extra pension
benefits they weren’t entitled to.  Former railroad employees who claimed to be unable to work
because they couldn’t stand, bend or grip objects without pain,
among other symptoms, were seen playing golf, shoveling snow and
taking a 400-mile bike ride, according to the complaint. The two
doctors charged allegedly helped hundreds of people collect
bogus disability benefits.  The case is U.S. v. Ajemian, 11-2748, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  Editors: Fred Strasser,  Andrew Dunn   To contact the reporter on this story:
