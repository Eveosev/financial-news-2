Germany ’s bonds advanced, with five-,
10- and 30-year yields dropping to record lows, as signs the
global economy is losing momentum spurred demand for the euro
area’s safest assets.  Benchmark 10-year bunds gained for a third week after a
European report showed services and manufacturing output shrank
in April, and the U.S. Labor Department said payrolls rose less
than economists forecast. French bonds advanced for a third day
before the nation votes in a presidential ballot this weekend.
Greece will hold parliamentary elections. Italian and Spanish
bonds gained.  “The latest employment report suggests U.S. labor-market
conditions have softened in the early part of the second
quarter, lifting bunds,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in
Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets Ltd., a broker for banks.
“Uncertainty ahead of the weekend elections in  Greece  and
 France  is also a supportive factor.”  The German 30-year yield dropped three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 2.3 percent at 4:13 p.m.  London  time
after falling to an all-time low 2.294 percent. The 2.5 percent
bond maturing in July 2044 gained 0.775, or 7.75 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,312) face amount, to 104.41.  The 10-year yield declined three basis points to 1.59
percent after sliding to a record 1.58 percent. The yield fell
11 basis points this week. Five-year yields dropped as much as
four basis points to an all-time low 0.546 percent.  The benchmark 10-year yield is poised to decline toward 1.5
percent, RIA Capital’s Stamenkovic said.  Manufacturing, Services  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing industries dropped to
46.7 from 49.1 in March, London-based Markit Economics said.
That’s below an initial estimate of 47.4 on April 23. A reading
of less than 50 indicates contraction.  U.S. employers added 115,000 workers in April, the least in
six months, after hiring 154,000 in March, the Labor Department
said in  Washington . Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
forecast an increase of 160,000.  “The data just reinforces the current risk-averse mood
that continues to support core bonds,” said  Orlando Green , a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London.  French Bonds  French bonds gained as five polls showed socialist
candidate  Francois Hollande  leading before the May 6 vote.
Hollande has called for a re-negotiation of the budget pact
agreed by European leaders in March, saying it needs to place
more emphasis on growth.  France’s 10-year yield dropped seven basis points to 2.84
percent after falling to 2.8 percent, the lowest level since
March 5.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of similar-maturity German bunds shrank four basis
points to 126 basis points. The spread expanded to 149 basis
points on April 20, the widest since Jan. 9  “A Hollande victory is largely priced in and it is
probably limited to what extent he can reverse policy,” said
 Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in London.
“We are seeing more interest in buying at the wider levels,”
she said, referring to the difference in yield between French
and German bonds.  Spanish 10-year yields declined three basis points to 5.75
percent, and similar-maturity  Italian yields  dropped four basis
points to 5.46 percent.  Greek bonds due February 2023 fell for a fourth day before
the country holds parliamentary elections on May 6. The yield
climbed 10 basis points to 20.58 percent.  German debt has returned 1.6 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. French bonds gained 2.6 percent,
and Spanish securities fell 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
