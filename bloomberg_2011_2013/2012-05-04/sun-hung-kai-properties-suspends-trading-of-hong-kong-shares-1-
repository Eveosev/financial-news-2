Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) ,  Hong
Kong ’s biggest developer, halted trading of its shares today
pending a price-sensitive announcement.  Hong Kong’s anti-corruption commission arrested Thomas and
 Raymond Kwok , the billionaire co-chairmen of Sun Hung Kai, and
Rafael Hui, formerly the city’s No. 2 official, in March in one
of the highest-level investigations in the body’s 38-year
history. Thomas Chan, an executive director of the company, had
been arrested earlier. As of yesterday, no charges had been
laid by the  Independent Commission Against Corruption , known as
the ICAC.  The probe has increased public concern about real estate
policies implemented by the government as property price gains
made Hong Kong the world’s most expensive place to own a home.
Thomas and Raymond Kwok were arrested in connection with a probe
into offenses suspected to have been committed under the
Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, the company said March 29.  Sun Hung Kai’s spokeswoman Brenda Wong declined to comment
on today’s suspension, as did Valentina Chan, a spokeswoman for
the ICAC.  Sun Hung Kai shares have fallen 15 percent in Hong Kong
trading since the March 29 arrests, compared with a 1 percent
decline in the Hang Seng Property Index.  Raymond Kwok denied any wrongdoing at an April 4 press
conference at the company’s headquarters, his first and only
comments since the arrest.  SUNeVision Holdings Ltd. (8008) , a unit of Sun Hung Kai, also
suspended trading in its shares today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
