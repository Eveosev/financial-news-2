Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  will begin selling two
new varieties of K-Cup portion packs for  Green Mountain Coffee
Roasters Inc. (GMCR) ’s Keurig brewers after strong sales.  “Starbucks K-Cups continue to see robust gains,”
Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said in an e-
mail to employees yesterday, after Green Mountain shares plunged
48 percent on second-quarter revenue that trailed analysts’
estimates.  “I cannot analyze or comment on the company’s  performance ,
which disappointed the Street, but I did want to share with you
that Starbucks relationship with Green Mountain remains as
strong as ever,” he said in the e-mail obtained by Bloomberg
News. Seattle-based Starbucks has shipped more than 230 million
K-Cups since it began selling the pods at supermarkets and
retailers last year, he said.  Starbucks will begin selling branded K-Cups in its cafes
and two new varieties in grocery stores “in the coming
months,” he said, without describing the varieties. Schultz
also said that the company’s  Europe , Middle East and Africa
business “is in the early days” of a turnaround and that sales
of lattes are “up significantly” in the  region .  Starbucks fell 1.9 percent to $55.56 at the close in  New
York . Waterbury, Vermont-based Green Mountain  dropped  3 percent
to $25.10, after advancing as much as 8.2 percent earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
