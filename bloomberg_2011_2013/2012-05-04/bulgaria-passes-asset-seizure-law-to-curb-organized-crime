Bulgaria  passed a law allowing it to
seize assets from criminals which will help it meet European
Union demands to fight organized crime.  Law-enforcement authorities will be able to seize assets
worth more than 250,000 lev ($168,000) if it is proven they were
illegally acquired, Justice Minister Diana Kovacheva told
reporters in Sofia today. A special committee will probe the
assets of people investigated for alleged crimes as far back as
15 years. The law will take effect in six months.  The EU has repeatedly criticized Bulgaria for failing to
curb crime and corruption since the former communist country
joined the bloc in 2007 on condition the government accepts
monitoring to ensure it will complete legal changes and continue
to receive EU aid. Bulgaria, with 7.5 million people, may draw
11 billion euros, of which it has used 24 percent.  The European Commission, the EUâ€™s executive arm in
Brussels, recommended to speed up the process of criminal assets
forfeiture in its Feb. 8 report, as one of the steps to punish
crime. The next assessment report will be released in July. EU
warnings have prompted probes of Cabinet ministers, business
leaders and lawmakers, though convictions have been rare except
for minor corruption cases involving mayors and police officers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
