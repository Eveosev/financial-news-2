Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA)  Chief Executive Officer
Ton Buechner, who took the helm on April 23, won’t split up the
specialty chemical and coatings maker and new targets have been
handed to managers of the U.S. decorative paint business that’s
under review.  A decision on the strategic future of the U.S. operation,
which makes the Glidden brand of household paint, has yet to be
taken, Buechner said in an interview with Het Financieele
Dagblad. Comments from the CEO of the Amsterdam-based company
were confirmed by spokeswoman Dieuwertje ten Feld.  “It is about how we are dealing with the business and when
we want to have something done,” Ten Feld said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
