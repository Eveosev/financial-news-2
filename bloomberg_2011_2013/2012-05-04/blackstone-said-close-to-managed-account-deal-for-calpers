Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world’s
largest private-equity firm, is close to signing a deal with the
California Public Employees’ Retirement System for a separately
managed account, according to a person with knowledge of the
plans.  Blackstone and the pension, known as Calpers, are in the
final stages of negotiating the deal and may announce an
agreement as early as next week, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the discussions are private.  Peter Rose , a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone,
declined to comment. Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for Calpers, said
he couldn’t immediately comment.  Separately managed accounts offer cheaper fees and more
control for investors, who in turn agree to commit large sums
for a decade or more. Firms have been using these custom
arrangements to attract investors as they compete for a
shrinking pool of investor dollars. In November, the Teacher
Retirement System of Texas committed $3 billion each to  KKR &
Co. (KKR)  and  Apollo Global Management LLC. (APO)   Blackstone a month later won as much as $1.5 billion from
the New Jersey State Investment Council, to be placed into four
custom funds. The deal will save the state about $120 million in
fees over the life of the agreement, the council said at the
time.  Blackstone’s discussions with Calpers were reported earlier
today by Fortune magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
