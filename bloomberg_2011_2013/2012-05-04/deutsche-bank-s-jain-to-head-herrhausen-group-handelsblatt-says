Anshu Jain, the future co-chief
executive officer of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , will become chairman of
the lender’s Alfred Herrhausen Society,  Handelsblatt  reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  Jain will replace Deutsche Bank CEO  Josef Ackermann  as head
of the independent, not-for-profit organization that arranges
business and political forums, Handelsblatt said.  The society is named after former Deutsche Bank CEO
Herrhausen, who was assassinated in 1989, and is the so-called
international forum of Deutsche Bank, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
