The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of 24
commodities declined 0.4 percent to 666.44 at 4:46 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
dropped 0.1 percent to 1,554.237.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell to its lowest level in more than three weeks in
New York and headed for a weekly decline as worse-than-forecast
U.S. economic data and  Europe ’s outlook stoked speculation fuel
demand may drop.  Crude for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
fell as much as 99 cents to $101.55 a barrel, the lowest since
April 11, and was at $101.57 at 8:58 a.m. London time. Prices
are 3.2 percent lower this week and poised for the first weekly
decline in three.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas headed for a second weekly advance in  New York ,
the longest run of gains in five months, after a government
report showed supplies increased by less than the seasonal
average.  Gas was little changed at $2.341 per million British
thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:49 p.m.
Singapore time. Prices rose 3.9 percent to $2.34 yesterday after
the Energy Department said U.S. stockpiles  expanded by 28
billion cubic feet last week, below the five-year average gain
for the week of 79 billion. Analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg showed an expected increase of 29 billion.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude, a benchmark price for
 Asia , dropped 10 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $16.98 a barrel at
10:03 a.m.  Singapore  time, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a broker. The spread  has widened 0.5 percent
this week and is poised for the longest weekly rising streak
since February 2011. Singapore gasoil swaps for June fell $1.58,
or 1.2 percent, to $129.67 a barrel, the lowest price since Feb.
6.  Naphtha swaps for June fell $16.25, or 1.7 percent, to $956
a metric ton today, the lowest price since Jan. 26, PVM data
showed. Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell to $80.62 a ton today from $97.70 yesterday. The
spread has narrowed 13 percent this week, the third weekly
decline.  High-sulfur fuel-oil swaps for June fell $8, or 1.1
percent, to $704.50 a metric ton, PVM data showed. Prices have
fallen 3.2 percent so far this week.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold is set to decline for a fourth day after the  European
Central Bank  refrained from providing more stimulus, curbing
demand for the metal as an alternative asset. Silver headed for
the biggest weekly drop in seven weeks.  Gold for immediate delivery was little changed at $1,634.34
an ounce at 2:57 p.m. in Singapore, down 1.7 percent this week.
Spot silver was little changed at $30.0775 an ounce after
gaining 0.3 percent. Prices are set to drop 3.8 percent this
week, the biggest decline since the five days ended March 16.  BASE METALS  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans advanced for the first time in four days as U.S.
export sales increased, draining inventories in the world’s
largest grower. Corn and wheat rose.  July-delivery soybeans gained 0.4 percent to $14.7875 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 3:31 p.m. Singapore
time, trimming the first weekly loss since March to 1 percent.  Corn for July delivery gained 0.4 percent to $6.1675 a
bushel, set for a 1.4 percent loss this week. Wheat for delivery
in the same month gained 0.6 percent to $6.19 a bushel, trimming
the weekly loss to 4.8 percent.  Palm oil  gained, trimming the biggest weekly decline this
year, on speculation that demand for cooking oils will climb as
dry weather in South America lowers soybean supplies and global
inventories.  The July-delivery contract gained as much as 0.5 percent to
3,395 ringgit ($1,118) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and ended the morning session at 3,386 ringgit in  Kuala
Lumpur . Futures are down 3.4 percent this week, the biggest
five-day loss since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
