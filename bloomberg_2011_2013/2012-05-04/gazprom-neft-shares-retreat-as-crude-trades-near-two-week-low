OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of
 Russia ’s natural gas export monopoly, sank to its lowest level
in more than five months as oil dropped the most since December.  The shares retreated 4.5 percent to 132.81 rubles by the
close in Moscow, their weakest price since Nov. 21.  Oil fell after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
said yesterday the region’s economic prospects had downside
risks, while reports showed service industries in the U.S. grew
less than projected and consumer confidence weakened. Oil may
decrease next week as economic growth and fuel demand slows,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Crude for June delivery slid 4.4 percent to $98.02 in New
York, heading for the biggest fall since Dec. 14 after a report
showed U.S. employers added fewer workers than forecast last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
