Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a fourth
day this week as the central bank sold less securities than
investors demanded at its repurchase auction.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.1 percent to close at 83.15 to the dollar in Nairobi trading
after slipping as much as 0.4 percent to 83.40.  Kenya accepted 5 billion shillings ($60 million) of bids
for seven-day repurchase agreements at a weighted average rate
of 17.75 percent, after receiving offers totalling 7.5 billion
shillings and offering 5 billion shillings of the securities,
Godfrey Putunoi, an official in the bank’s money market
department, said in a phone interview today. The bank has
accepted a total of 11 billion shillings this week from
 repurchase agreements , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The average  interbank rate  decreasing to 15.74 percent
during the week from 19.31 percent in the previous week
reflecting improved liquidity in the money market, with the bank
sterilizing the excess liquidity from the market by mopping
excess liquidity,” the central bank said in its weekly bulletin
e-mailed today.  Tanzania’s shilling strengthened for the second day,
climbing 0.6 percent to close at 1,581 per dollar, the highest
since Jan 13.  The Ugandan shilling weakened first for the first time in
four days, closing down 0.1 percent to 2,460 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
