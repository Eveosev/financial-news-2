Oil options volatility jumped to the
highest level in almost three weeks as concern that the pace of
the economic recovery was slowing sent underlying futures
tumbling below $100 a barrel for the first time since February.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27 percent at 4:20 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest level since April 16. It was up
from 24.9 percent yesterday. Volatility was at a 12-month low of
20.7 percent a week ago.  “We’re seeing a lot of angst about Europe’s economy again,
we’ve got the U.S. slowing and we’ve got a lot of liquidation on
the way down,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude oil for June delivery fell $4.05, or 3.9 percent, to
settle at $98.49 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices dropped 6.1
percent this week, the biggest weekly loss since September.  Futures declined as lower-than-expected U.S. job gains in
April and a slowdown in  Europe ’s service and manufacturing
sectors raised concern about fuel demand.  Before today’s loss, crude had traded in a range of $100.68
to $105.07 since April 4.  “We broke $100 and finally broke out of this range,”
Rigolini said. “There was a lot of demand for puts.”  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were June $95 puts, which rose 55 cents to 85 cents a barrel at

second-most active with 7,510 lots changing hands. They gained
