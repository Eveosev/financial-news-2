The pound was set for a third weekly
gain versus the euro as  France  and  Greece  prepare to hold
elections this weekend amid uncertainty about the region’s
commitment to austerity measures.  Gilts extended a second weekly advance as a report showed
U.S. employers added fewer workers than forecast last month. A
euro-area report showed services and manufacturing output shrank
in April, adding to concern the region’s debt crisis will
worsen. The U.K. currency headed for a weekly decline against
the dollar after British  house prices  dropped in April.  “You don’t want to be too long euros, but nobody is,”
said Adrian Schmidt, a foreign-exchange strategist at Lloyds
Banking Group Plc in London. “There’s more uncertainty about
the Greek situation. Sterling remains resilient to bad news. The
house price data showed a reversal of last month’s gain.”  The pound appreciated 0.1 percent to 81.27 pence per euro
at 2:06 p.m.  London  time, extending this week’s gain to 0.3
percent. The currency rose to 81.03 pence yesterday, the
strongest since June 2010. Sterling was little changed at
$1.6178, having dropped 0.5 percent this week.  France and Greece both hold elections on May 6, with French
voters casting ballots in the final round of the country’s
presidential race and Greeks set to decide on a new parliament.  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing dropped to 46.7 from 49.1
in March, London-based Markit Economics said. That’s the fastest
rate of decline since October and below an estimate of 47.4
published on April 23. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. payrolls climbed 115,000, the smallest gain in six
months, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington . The
median estimate of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was
for a 160,000 increase.  The pound pared gains versus the dollar after Halifax said
its U.K. house price  index  dropped 2.4 percent from March, the
largest monthly decline since September 2010. Prices had
increased 2.2 percent in March.  Sterling has strengthened 3.6 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 0.9 percent, and the euro climbed 1 percent.  DMO Auction  The 10-year gilt yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2 percent, having dropped 13 basis points
this week. The 4 percent bond due March 2022 rose 0.39, or 3.90
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount to 117.795.  The Debt Management Office auctioned 3 billion pounds of
bills maturing in 28, 91 and 181 days. The debt office sold 1.5
billion pounds of the six-month bills at a yield of 0.434
percent. That compares with 0.437 percent at the previous sale
of the maturity on April 27.  The 10-year  yield  is heading toward the April 10 low of
2.01 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A break
below that level may target a move toward the Feb. 28 low at
1.98 percent, the data show.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 0.8 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Treasuries
returned 0.2 percent, and German bunds gained 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
