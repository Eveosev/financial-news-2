Gold gained for the first time this
week after a government report showed U.S. employers added fewer
workers than forecast in April, raising speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will add stimulus measures to boost growth.  Payrolls climbed 115,000, the smallest gain in six months,
the Labor Department said. The median estimate of 85 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 160,000 advance. Bullion
surged about 70 percent from the end of December 2008 through
June as the Fed held borrowing costs at a record low and bought
$2.3 trillion in housing and government debt during two rounds
of so-called quantitative easing.  “People are investing in gold for two reasons: One,
because they are worried about the economy so this is a safe
bet, and also should any kind of monetary of fiscal stimulus be
announced, gold will be a good hedge,” Pratik Sharma, a  fund
manager  at  Boca Raton , Florida-based Atyant Capital Management
Ltd., said in a telephone interview  Gold futures for June delivery gained 0.1 percent to $1,637
an ounce at 9:25 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices fell 1.8
percent in the previous four days.  “Some people will be looking at gold as a flight-to-
quality as the job numbers are lighter than expected,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a market strategist at Archer Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “People are
tilting towards the camp that expects some kind of easing.”  Silver futures for July delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$30.095 an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
