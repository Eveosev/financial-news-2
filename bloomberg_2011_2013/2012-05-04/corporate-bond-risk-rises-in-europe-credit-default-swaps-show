The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt rose for a third day, heading for the
first weekly increase in three weeks, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings advanced four
basis points to 648 at 10 a.m. in London, and were up from 644
April 27. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of
 credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose two basis points to 143, compared
with 138 last week.  The cost of insuring financial debt is heading for the
first weekly increase in two, with the Markit iTraxx Financial
Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks and insurers up four
basis points today at 243 and the subordinated index two higher
at 397.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
