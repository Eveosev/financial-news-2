DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private coal
and power producer, is seeking further acquisitions in the power
production and distribution segment, said Chief Operating
Officer Yuriy Ryzhenkov.  DTEK is “looking for further opportunities in power
distribution segment,” Ryzhenkov said during a conference call
with investors today.  The company today bought a 45 percent stake in power
producer Krymenergo, following the acquisition of holdings in
five more power producing and distributing companies since
December.  -- Editor: Tim Farrand  To contact the reporters on this story:
