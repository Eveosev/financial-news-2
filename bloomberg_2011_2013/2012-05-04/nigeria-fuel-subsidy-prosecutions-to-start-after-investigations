Prosecutions in Nigeria, where a
parliamentary probe found illegal payments were made for
gasoline subsidies, will take place after anti-graft agencies
conduct investigations, said Justice Minister Mohammed Bello Adoke.  The report, written by a House of Representatives committee
and approved by lawmakers in  Africa ’s biggest oil producer on
April 25, will be looked into by “the relevant  law enforcement 
and anti-corruption agencies” in order to file any criminal
charges, he said in a statement e-mailed today in Abuja, the
capital.  The lawmakers’ probe found as much as 1.1 trillion naira
($7 billion) was paid illegally to gasoline importers. Trade
unions and labor groups have called for Petroleum Minister
Diezani Alison-Madueke to be fired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
