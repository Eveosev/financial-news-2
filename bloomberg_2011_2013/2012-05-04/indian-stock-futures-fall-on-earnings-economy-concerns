Indian stocks dropped for the third
day as the rupee weakened, spurring concern the government may
find it hard to cool inflation and curb the fiscal deficit.  State Bank of India , the nation’s biggest lender, lost 1.5
percent.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the largest developer, declined 2.1 percent.
The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, lost 0.4 percent to
17,082.22 at 9:21 a.m. in Mumbai.  The rupee slid as low as 53.705 per dollar, the weakest
since Dec. 14. A weak rupee lifts the cost of imported oil and
other raw materials, fueling inflation and reducing the central
bank’s scope to pare rates. India imports about 80 percent of
its oil needs.  The Sensex has risen 11 percent this year amid speculation
the central bank will ease monetary policy to boost growth. The
gauge trades at 13.3 times future earnings,  compared with  the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.6 times.  Indian stocks tracked regional peers lower as  Australia ’s
central bank cut its economic growth forecast and U.S. service
industries rose less than forecast, sparking concern the global
recovery may be faltering. The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan
Index dropped 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
