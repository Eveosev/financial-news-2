Palm oil  posted the biggest weekly
decline this year on speculation that production in Malaysia
probably gained for a second month in April, boosting global
cooking-oil supplies.  The July-delivery contract declined 0.6 percent to 3,358
ringgit ($1,104) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange in Kuala Lumpur. Futures lost 4.2 percent this week,
the biggest five-day loss since November.  Palm oil output gained 2.1 percent to 1.21 million tons in
March from 1.19 million tons in February, the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board said on April 10. The board is scheduled to release
official data for April on May 10.  “Earlier people had anticipated palm oil production to be
unchanged, and now they are predicting an 8 percent to 9 percent
rise,” Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at LT International
Futures (M) Sdn., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur . “Soybean
planting in the U.S. was also started earlier than anticipated
this year and weather is also favorable.”  About 12 percent of the U.S. soybean crop was planted as of
April 29, compared with the previous five-year average of 5
percent, a Department of Agriculture report showed April 30.
 Soybean oil  competes with palm oil for use in food and fuels.  Soybeans for July delivery gained 0.4 percent to $14.79 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for the same
month gained 0.3 percent to 54.30 cents per pound.  Palm oil for September delivery climbed 0.2 percent to end
at 8,650 yuan ($1,373) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while soybean oil for the same month closed little changed at
9,772  yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
