Nigeria ’s naira made a weekly gain
against the dollar as demand for foreign currency weakened.  The currency of Africa’s largest oil producer gained 0.3
percent in the past five days to 157.2 against the dollar,
compared with a decline of the same margin a week earlier. In
today’s trading, the currency declined less than 0.1 percent as
of 4:07 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  this week sold $270 million to
lenders at its foreign-currency auctions, where demand has
declined this year while dollar inflows are rising, according to
Samir Gadio, an  emerging markets  strategist at Standard Bank
Group Ltd. in London. The naira “is very well supported” by
foreign-currency investments in high-yielding debt sales
including Treasury bills and bonds, Gadio said by phone today.  “Seasonal month-end sales of U.S. dollars by major oil
exporters on the  interbank market  should provide ample support
to the naira over the next week,” Celeste Fauconnier and Nema
Ramkhelawan-Bhana, Africa strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, wrote in a report April 30  Ghana’s cedi gained 0.3 percent to 1.863 per dollar today
in Accra, the capital. The currency weakened 0.4 percent this
week compared with a decline of 1.6 percent last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
