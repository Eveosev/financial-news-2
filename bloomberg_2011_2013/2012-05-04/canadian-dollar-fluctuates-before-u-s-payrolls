Canada ’s dollar oscillated against its
U.S. counterpart, trading close to a seven-month high, before an
American jobs report that economists predict will show
acceleration in hiring last month.  The currency is headed for a 0.8 percent loss this week
versus the greenback on speculation that bets the nation’s
central bank will raise borrowing costs this year are overdone.
Two-year government bond yields have  climbed  37 basis points
this year to 1.31 percent on the nation’s growth prospects
relative to other Group of Seven countries.  “I do like the Canadian dollar,” said Jane Foley, a
senior currency strategist at Rabobank International, by phone
from London. “The fundamentals are very good. Because it has
come away off the best levels it stands to gain again if we get
a better-than-expected report.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, was little changed
at 98.80 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 7:52 a.m. in Toronto. It
touched 98 cents on April 27, the strongest since September. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0121.  To contact the reporter on this story:
