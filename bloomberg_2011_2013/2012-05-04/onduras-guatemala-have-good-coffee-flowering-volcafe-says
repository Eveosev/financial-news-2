Honduras  and  Guatemala , Central
America’s largest coffee growers, are having “good” flowering
before the start of the next crop, according to Volcafe Ltd.  Producers in Guatemala are reporting the progress in all
regions, Volcafe, the coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man
Holdings Ltd., said in a report e-mailed today. In Honduras, the
flowerings are “nice” and can be seen in the low and medium
altitude areas, according to the report.  “One more round of flowering will take place during the
next few weeks” in Guatemala, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based
trader said. Flowering in the higher-growing regions in Honduras
will take place later in the month.  The extent of flowering in coffee trees usually gives an
indication about the size of the upcoming crops. The 2012-13
harvest will start in October in both countries.  Beans from Honduras for May and June shipments were at a
discount of 6 cents a pound to the price on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York , unchanged from last week, Volcafe data show.  Arabica coffee for July delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1.754
a pound by 10:03 a.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
