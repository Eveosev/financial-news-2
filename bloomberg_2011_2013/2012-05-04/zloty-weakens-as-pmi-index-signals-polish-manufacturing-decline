The zloty weakened against the euro
for the third day as weaker-than-expected manufacturing data
signalled Polish production is stagnating.  Poland’s currency retreated 0.1 percent to 4.1832 per euro
as of 1:00 p.m. in Warsaw. The yield on the nation’s five-year
bonds lost two basis points to 4.8 percent, according to generic
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The country’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index
decreased to 49.2 in April from 50.1 in March, HSBC Holdings Plc
said in an e-mail on May 2 summarizing a survey by  Markit
Economics . The median estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg
survey was 49.5. The index fell below 50, a level showing a
contraction, for the third time in the past six months,
following uninterrupted gains from November 2010 to October last
year.  “We think data confirm expected slowdown in Polish economy
and should join arguments against monetary tightening at the
nearest Monetary Policy Council meeting,” analysts at Bank
Zachodni WBK SA led by Warsaw-based Maciej Reluga wrote in a
research note sent to clients today.  Poland’s central bank will meet next week to set the level
for the benchmark rate, which has been kept at 4.5 percent for
10 months.  Economic growth will slow to 2.5 percent this year,
the government forecasts, from 4.3 percent in 2011 amid a
recession in the euro region, where the nation sells two thirds
of its exports.  Poland ’s markets were closed on May 1 and May 3 for public
holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
