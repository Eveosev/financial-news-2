Serbian authorities arrested eight
people in a mostly ethnic Albanian-populated southern area,
including five sought for alleged crimes against civilians
during an insurgency a decade ago.  The eight were held in a morning raid in two villages close
to the border with  Kosovo , the province which unilaterally
declared independence in 2008, the government said in a
statement. Some of those detained were arrested on suspicion of
illegal possession of weapons and obstructing justice, Interior
Minister Ivica Dacic told state-run television.  The arrests came two days before Serbian elections in which
Dacic is running for president and his Socialist Party is
expected to rank third in the parliamentary vote, according to
recent polls.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization force in Kosovo,
known as KFOR, said last week it would add 700 soldiers, mostly
from Germany and  Austria , to the existing 6,220 troops as a
precaution during the Serbian elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
