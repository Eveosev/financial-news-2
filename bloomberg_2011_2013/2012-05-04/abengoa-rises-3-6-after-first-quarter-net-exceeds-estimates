Abengoa SA (ABG) , an engineering firm that
builds solar thermal generators and ethanol distilleries, rose
as much as 6.5 percent to a one-month high in Madrid trading
after first-quarter earnings exceeded analysts’ expectations.  The stock was 2.5 percent higher at 12.47 euros at 10:55
a.m. local time. The Seville-based company said profit jumped 57
percent from a year earlier to 88.6 million euros ($116.4
million) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization were 284.7 million euros. Analysts forecast Ebitda
of 277 million euros.  Abengoa is ramping up investment in the Americas as the
sovereign debt crisis crushes growth in Spain. The engineering
and construction division provided the largest portion of sales,
with revenue increasing 19 percent as it built two solar thermal
plants in the U.S. and power transmission lines in Brazil and
Peru.  “The results are ahead of the consensus,” said Rupesh Madlani, a clean technology analyst at  Barclays Capital  in
 London . “Focus will grow on the order backlog however.”  The company’s order book was 7.1 billion euros at the end
of March compared with 8.7 billion euros a year earlier.  The U.S. and  Latin America  provided 46 percent of sales.
Revenue from Abengoa’s solar generators more than tripled to 51
million euros as the company switched on plants in Spain and
Algeria.  To contact the reporters on this story:
