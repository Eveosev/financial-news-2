Belgacom SA (BELG) , the largest telephone
company in  Belgium , reported first-quarter profit that  beat 
analyst estimates as price increases slowed voice-revenue
erosion and modem rentals are no longer included in costs.  Net income in the three months through March increased to
199 million euros ($262 million) from 194 million euros a year
earlier, the Brussels-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts projected a decline to 179 million euros, the average
of 11  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 0.3 percent to
1.59 billion euros, also surpassing analyst estimates.  Belgacom raised prices of most services by 3.4 percent at
the start of this year, passing on inflation to customers and
reversing a revenue decline in the consumer division that had
worsened in the second half of last year. The phone company also
began capitalizing modems rented to new broadband customers,
with the associated costs no longer showing up in the income
statement. Amortization charges also fell as Belgacom lost the
exclusive rights to broadcast Belgian soccer matches and finance
costs declined after being inflated by a bond buyback in 2011.  “Once again we were able to gain many new customers,
growing our customer base for most products,” Chief Executive
Officer Didier Bellens said in the statement. “We are pleased
to start the year with solid revenue and Ebitda on track to meet
our full-year guidance.”  New Customers  Belgacom added 15,000 broadband customers in the quarter,
surpassing analyst estimates of 8,000 net additions, and began
offering free access to its mobile network for clients on
broadband Internet subscriptions last month.  An additional 37,000 households signed up for its TV
offering, less than the 45,000 net additions Telenet Group
Holding NV reported for the quarter, and Belgacom also added
5,000 mobile-phone customers. It lost an additional 37,000
fixed-voice lines, little changed from 35,000 in the preceding
quarter.  The phone company, which is  majority owned  by the Belgian
state, generated 179 million euros of cash not required for
reinvestment in the quarter, a 25 percent drop from the same
period a year earlier.  Capital spending  rose by 7.5 percent to
186 million euros, mainly reflecting the accounting shift in
modem rentals.  Belgacom needs to generate about 685 million euros of free
 cash flow  this year to cover a  stable dividend  of 2.18 euros a
share over 2012 earnings, to which it already committed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
