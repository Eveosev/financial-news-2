Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rose, pushing the yield to the lowest level in two and a half
years, on speculation banks increased purchases on surplus cash.
The dong weakened.  The securities advanced for a 13th day, the longest winning
streak since July 2006, and had their best weekly advance since
October 2009. Local lenders had about 12 trillion dong ($575
million) of surplus funds as of April 17, Thoi Bao Kinh Te
newspaper reported today, citing the National Financial
Supervisory Commission.  “Demand is high now since banks have lots of idle cash,”
said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-based bond trader at Bank for
Investment & Development of Vietnam. “Compared with current
overnight lending interest rates of as low as 3 percent in the
 interbank market , bond yields have become quite attractive.”  The  yield  on the five-year notes fell 26 basis points to
10.24 percent, according to a daily fixing rate from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. That was the biggest one-day drop in two
months and the lowest level since November 2009. The yield
dropped 41 basis points, or 0.41 percentage point, this week.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  at which banks lend to
one another, a gauge of liquidity in the financial system,
dropped 24 basis points to 4.30 percent today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate tumbled from 11.81 percent at
the end of 2011.  The dong weakened 0.4 percent to 20,853 per dollar as of
5:04 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency strengthened 0.2 percent this week. The  State Bank  of
Vietnam set the currency’s reference rate at 20,828, unchanged
since Dec. 26, according to its website. The dong is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Anil Varma  To contact the reporters on this story:
