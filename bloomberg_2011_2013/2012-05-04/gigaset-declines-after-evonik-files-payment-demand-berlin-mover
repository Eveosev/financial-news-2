Gigaset AG (GGS) , the Munich-based maker of
cordless telephones, fell to the lowest since November 2010
after Evonik Degussa GmbH filed proceedings against it at the
German Institution of Arbitration.  Gigaset fell as much as 9.2 percent and traded down 6.8
percent at 1.88 euros as of 11:11 a.m. in  Frankfurt .  Evonik is demanding a penalty payment of 12 million euros
($15.8 million) on the basis of a contract entered into in 2006,
Gigaset said in a statement yesterday.  Gigaset said it rejected Evonik’s “allegations and
claims.” The company said it has “adequate provision for risk
of loss in the 2011 financial statements.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
