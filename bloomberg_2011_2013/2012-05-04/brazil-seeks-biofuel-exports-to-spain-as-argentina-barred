Brazilian biodiesel producers are
seeking export agreements with Spanish oil companies after the
European country moved to cut off imports of the renewable fuel
from Argentina.  Erasmo Carlos Battistella, president of the biofuel trade
group  Associacao dos Produtores de Biodiesel do Brasil , will
discuss the issue at a meeting today with Spain’s ambassador in
Brasilia.  Spain is cutting trade ties with Argentina after the South
American country said it would seize control of  YPF SA (YPFD)  from the
Spanish energy company  Repsol YPF SA. (REP)  That’s creating a market
for Brazil’s biofuels industry, Battistella said.  “It’s opened up a major export opportunity” for Brazilian
producers, he said in a telephone interview today. “Argentina
was a big supplier there.” He expects trade contracts to be
signed within three months.  Spain revised an incentive program last month to exclude
biofuels produced outside  Europe  from meeting government
requirements for using renewable fuel. That effectively blocked
imports from Argentina and other nations in the region.
Battistella will ask that Brazil be included on the list of
approved suppliers.  Brazil’s biodiesel plants have annual production capacity
of 6.94 billion liters (1.83 billion gallons). Of that, 15
factories with 4.59 billion liters of capacity have been
approved for exports, Battistella said. Spain purchased 1.87
billion liters of biodiesel from Argentina in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
