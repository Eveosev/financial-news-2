European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said  Portugal  is doing a good job at carrying out
structural reforms and reducing its budget deficit to overcome
an “enormous challenge” after seeking a bailout last year.  “What Portugal has done so far, it has done well,”
Barroso, a former premier of the Iberian nation, said today at a
conference in Cascais, Portugal. The country “can count on the
solidarity of its European partners.”  EU countries that show the most determination in responding
to the debt crisis will receive the greatest support from the
European Union, said Barroso. “Nothing can replace the effort
of each country in response to its own difficulties,” he said.  Barroso’s comments came before elections in France and
 Greece  that may challenge the euro area’s push to revive
economic confidence by cutting budget deficits as the region’s
economy slides toward its second recession in three years.
Germany’s regional election is also next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
