CBS Corp. (CBS) , the most-watched TV
network, entered into a supplemental agreement with Chief
Executive Officer  Leslie Moonves , offering him incentives to
become a producer after his contract expires in February 2015.  CBS would invest as much as $3 million a year to establish
staffing and infrastructure for projects that Moonves, 62, may
develop, according to a regulatory  filing  today.  The New York-based company is also willing to pay Moonves
$1.5 million for his services as a producer, with that sum
reduced by any producing fees the executive receives for shows
that get ordered, according to the filing.  CBS fell 2.5 percent to $33.22 at the close in New York
today. The stock has gained 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
