Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG) , the sports
and entertainment company that owns the  New York Knicks , rose
the most in more than five months after third-quarter profit
topped analysts’ estimates.  The sports division delivered its most profitable quarter
since MSG was spun off from  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)  two years
ago. Ticket and merchandise sales from the National Basketball
Association’s Knicks, helped by point guard Jeremy Lin’s
success, fueled a 37 percent increase in sales to $216.1
million. The unit’s operating income rose to $25.4 million.  MSG shares increased 3.9 percent to $37.94 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 32 percent this year.  Total third-quarter  net income  climbed 63 percent to $31.1
million, or 40 cents a share, from $19.1 million, or 25 cents, a
year earlier. Analysts had estimated 18 cents on average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 21 percent
to $400.5 million in the period, which ended March 31.  At MSG Media, which includes cable networks, revenue rose
13 percent to $166.2 million. MSG Entertainment, a division that
runs nonsporting events, saw sales fall 20 percent to $34.3
million. There weren’t as many entertainment events at Madison
Square Garden because an NBA labor dispute condensed the Knicks’
schedule, leaving fewer free nights.  MSG owns a range of assets, including the Madison Square
Garden venue, Radio City  Music Hall , the National Hockey
League’s  New York  Rangers, and cable networks MSG and Fuse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
