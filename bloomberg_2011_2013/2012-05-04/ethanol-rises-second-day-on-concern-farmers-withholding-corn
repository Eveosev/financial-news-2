Ethanol futures rose for a second day
in  Chicago  on speculation farmers are withholding corn sales in
an effort to increase price.  Futures followed corn higher on bets that farmers are
holding onto supply as prices for the grain are 10 percent lower
than a year ago, based on the most active contract. One bushel
of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol and producers are
losing 22.7 cents on every gallon, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Ethanol basically at this point is in a really low-margin
environment that’s tracking pretty heavily to its input side,”
said  Chris Wilson , an analyst at First Capitol Risk Management
in Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for June delivery climbed 0.4 cent to
settle at $2.204 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price was 2.3 cents higher than yesterday’s May contract
expiration. Ethanol has fallen 16 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago dropped 3 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $2.145 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive decreased 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.215,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slumped 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.225 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slipped 1.5
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.29.  Corn for July delivery, the most active contract, advanced
5.75 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $6.2025 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
