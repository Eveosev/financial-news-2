University of Kentucky  men’s
basketball coach  John Calipari  had incentives of almost $4
million added to his contract after the Wildcats’ national
championship last month.  The 53-year-old coach signed an eight-year deal last June
that will pay him at least $36.5 million should he stay through
the 2018-19 season. His new agreement, announced yesterday on
the school’s  athletics website , provides a $400,000 annual
increase in compensation from media rights and endorsements,
which amounts to $2.8 million total over the remaining seven
years of the agreement.  The school also added a $1 million retention bonus should
Calipari still be with the team on July 31, 2015, and extended
multiyear contracts totaling $1.2 million before bonuses to
assistants Orlando Antigua, Kenny Payne and John Robic.  “It’s rare, in this day and age, to be able to keep a
staff together that has helped produce a national championship
and back-to-back Final Four runs,”  Kentucky  Athletic Director
Mitch Barnhart said on the website.  The Wildcats are 102-14 in their last three seasons,
including a 51-0 record at Rupp Arena in Lexington. In April,
the team defeated the  University of Kansas  67-59 to win its
eighth National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament
title, and first since 1998.  Nine Wildcats have been selected in the National Basketball
Association draft in the past two years. Last month, the team’s
entire starting lineup, all underclassmen, said they would enter
the league’s annual player selection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
