The ruble depreciated against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket for a second day,
sliding to its weakest close in more than two months after a
report showed U.S. employers added fewer workers than forecast
last month.  The  ruble  lost 0.6 percent to 33.8926 against the basket,
the biggest drop since March 28. Yields on Russian local ruble-
denominated debt due 2027 rose two basis points to 8.27 percent.  Crude futures declined 4.2 percent to $98.26 per barrel in
 New York  after Labor Department figures showed U.S. payrolls
climbed 115,000, the smallest gain in six months. The median
estimate of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
160,000 advance.  The jobs data “added to the depreciation of the ruble,”
Peter Neimyshev, head of foreign exchange at Otkritie Bank in
Moscow, said by e-mail. “We’ll watch the developments on the
oil market.”  Exporters converting revenue from abroad into rubles may
help offset the depreciation in the Russian currency, Neimyshev
said. “There’s no shortage of dollar funds in the market” for
investors selling rubles, he said.  Forwards  The ruble lost 0.8 percent to 29.7301 per dollar and 0.4
percent to 38.98 per euro. Investors increased bets on the
currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the
ruble at 30.1675 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 29.91 per dollar yesterday.  Russia ’s dollar debt due 2015 was little changed with the
yield at 2.076 percent. Similar-maturity Eurobonds issued by OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, yielded eight basis points
less than yesterday at 3.234 percent, while the yield on 2015
dollar notes from state gas monopoly OAO Gazprom dropped three
basis points to 3.298 percent.  The cost of insuring Russian debt against nonpayment over
five years with credit default swaps rose three basis points to
189 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
