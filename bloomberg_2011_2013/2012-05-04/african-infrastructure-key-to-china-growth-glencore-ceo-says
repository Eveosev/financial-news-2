Investing in the development of
Africa’s commodities infrastructure is key to China’s long-term
growth, Glencore International Plc Chief Executive Officer Ivan
Glasenberg said.  “They are not investing in mines in Africa, but they are
investing in infrastructure,” Glasenberg said today at a
symposium in  St. Gallen , Switzerland. “The Chinese are saying:
‘We can get the infrastructure developed in Africa, and that
enables us to feed commodities into our country.’”  To contact the reporter on this story:
