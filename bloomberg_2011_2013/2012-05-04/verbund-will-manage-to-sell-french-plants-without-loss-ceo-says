Verbund AG (VER) , Austria’s biggest utility,
will manage to sell its French power plants without a loss,
according to Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Anzengruber.  Verbund owns a gas-fed power plant in Pont-sur-Sambre,
which is in production, and in one Toul, which is under
construction. France’s  Poweo (ALPWO)  SA has an option to buy the plants
by mid 2013.  “We will sell them in any case,” Anzengruber told
reporters in Vienna today. “There are interested parties.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
