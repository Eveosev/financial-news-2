  CF Industries Holdings Ltd. (CF) , the
largest U.S. producer of nitrogen-based fertilizers, dropped the
most in five months on speculation the company’s quarterly
earnings may be at a peak.  CF fell 6.9 percent to $183.91 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest percentage decline since Nov. 17.  The company yesterday after the close of regular trading
that first-quarter profit excluding a mark-to-market loss on gas
derivatives was $6.06 a share, topping the $4.95 average of 14
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted profit will be $7.69
in the second quarter and $5.05 in the third quarter, according
to estimates.  Factory outages, delayed imports and early crop planting
have helped to drive nitrogen-fertilizer prices higher, Charles Neivert, a New York-based analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. who
recommends holding the stock, said today in a note to clients.
Those market conditions “will be hard to exceed or even
replicate in the near future.”  The current quarter may “may represent a peak for earnings
for CF in this cycle,” he said.  U.S. farmers are expected to increase corn sowing by 4.3
percent to 95.864 million acres this year, the most since 1937,
the Department of Agriculture said on March 30, after surveying
growers. About 53 percent of the U.S. corn crop was planted as
of April 29, compared with an average of 27 percent in the past
five years, the USDA said April 30 in a  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
