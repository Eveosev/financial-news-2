The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development approved an 11 million-euro ($14.4 million) loan
to the city of  Subotica , northern  Serbia , to expand and upgrade
water supplies for some 12,000 people.  The 12-year, state-backed loan with a three-year grace
period will help improve environmental policies in the Balkan
country, which aspires to join the European Union, the London-
based lender said in an e-mailed statement today. Aligning
Serbiaâ€™s water infrastructure to EU standards would require
total investments of some 5.5 billion euros, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
