Declining corporate earnings and a
downgrade to Turkey’s credit outlook by  Standard & Poor’s  drove
Turkish stocks to their worst week in almost two months.  The benchmark ISE National 100 Index fell 2.6 percent in
the week to 59,015.69 at the close in Istanbul, its biggest 5-
day loss since March 9. Small and medium-sized companies led
losses, with fertilizer maker  Ege Gubre Sanayii (EGGUB)  dropping 16
percent, tire producer  Goodyear Lastikleri Turk AS (GOODY)  slumping 10
percent and clothing retailer  Boyner Buyuk Magazacilik AS (BOYNR) 
sinking 9.6 percent.  “Mid- and small-caps suffer from the slowdown of the
economy most,” Istanbul-based Tera Brokers said in an e-mailed
report to clients today. Earnings at Turkish companies with
market values of below $3 billion have contracted by 10 percent
this year, according to a tally of results reported so far, Tera
said.  The government predicts economic growth will slow to 4
percent this year from 8.5 percent last year as it tackles
record growth in lending and attempts to reduce the world’s
second-biggest  current account deficit .  S&P downgraded Turkey’s long-term foreign and local
currency ratings outlook to stable from positive May 1, citing
less-buoyant external demand and deteriorating terms of trade.
The drop this week pares the  ISE National 100 index (XU100) ’s rise this
year to 15 percent, following a 22 percent retreat in 2011. Of
all the companies in the gauge, 31 have reported first quarter
results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
