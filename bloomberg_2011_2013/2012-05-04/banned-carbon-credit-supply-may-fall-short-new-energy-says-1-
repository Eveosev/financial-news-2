Supply of soon-to-be banned emission
credits in the European Union’s carbon market may fall short of
expectations, boosting this year’s prices relative to 2013,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The EU has banned the use of United Nations credits from
some hydrofluorocarbon 23-producing chemical factories and
adipic-acid manufacturers from its trading system from next May,
saying these credits generate excessive profits. Those credits
make up more than half of supply in the Clean Development
Mechanism, the world’s biggest offsetting market.  Many of these credits are held by sovereign governments,
which may use them for compliance with targets through this year
under the 1997  Kyoto Protocol , said Richard Chatterton, an
analyst for New Energy Finance in London. He forecast use of
banned credits in 2012, the final year they’re allowed, will
fall 24 percent to 135 million tons.  “It’s becoming clearer that previous fears of a flood of
HFC credits may have been overdone,” Chatterton said today by
phone.  The premium for UN emission offsets for December 2013 over
those for 2012 narrowed to the least ever. The spread shrank 20
percent to 33 euro cents (43 U.S. cents) a metric ton on the ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange in London as of 4:12 p.m. local time.
That would be its narrowest-ever close. Credits for December
2013 dropped 3.9 percent to a record 3.92 euros a ton.  Compliance Costs  ArcelorMittal (MT)  and  Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest steel and
cement makers respectively, used the most UN offsets to cover EU
carbon-dioxide emissions last year, according to  data  on the
European Commission website published May 2.  Factories and power stations used 254.6 million offsets in
the bloc’s cap-and-trade program, the data show. Offsets may be
used to cut compliance costs with Europe’s carbon trading
system.  Emitters may use 277 million tons of credits next year, 8.6
percent more than last year, Chatterton forecast. That’s less
than the 300 million tons forecast by Deutsche Bank AG and 400
million tons by Barclays Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
