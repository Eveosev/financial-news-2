Commodities fell to the lowest level
in more than three months as oil tumbled below $100 a barrel on
weaker-than-expected U.S. employment data.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
dropped 2.4 percent, led down by West Texas Intermediate, after
the Labor Department in  Washington  said payrolls climbed by the
smallest amount in six months. WTI, which fell 3.9 percent,
accounts for 30.25 percent of the  index , the largest share.  “The jobs data is just another negative factor and all the
markets, crude, gasoline, just washed out,” said  Tom Bentz , a
director with BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage Inc. “There is no
clear sign of a bottom.”  The GSCI index declined to 653.60, the lowest level since
Jan. 20. Oil for June delivery fell $4.05 to $98.49 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement level
since Feb. 7.  April’s payroll growth was less than the 160,000 increase
forecast by economists polled by Bloomberg. The jobless rate
fell to a three-year low of 8.1 percent, and earnings stagnated.
The participation rate, which indicates the share of working-age
people in the  labor force , fell to 63.6 percent, the lowest
level since December 1981, from 63.8 percent.  Euro-region services and manufacturing output contracted
more than initially estimated in April. A euro-area composite
index based on a survey of purchasing managers in both
industries dropped to 46.7 from 49.1 in March, London-based
Markit Economics said today. That’s the steepest decline since
October and below an estimate of 47.4 published on April 23.  ‘Looking Oversupplied’  “Oil was already looking oversupplied before today’s
jobless number,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst at futures
brokerage PFGBest in  Chicago . “With  Europe  in recession and the
U.S. economy slowing, it’s getting harder to justify the long
side. The same goes for all the energies.”  Crude  supplies  rose 2.84 million barrels to 375.9 million
last week, the most since September 1990, the government said
May 2. U.S. domestic  output  increased 8,000 barrels a day to
6.12 million, the highest level since November 1999.  Nickel and silver were the biggest gainers in the GSCI
index. Nickel’s three-month rolling forward contract on the
London Metal Exchange rose 1.7 percent to $17,575 a metric ton.
Silver for July delivery, the most active contract, rose 1.4
percent to settle at $30.432 an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
