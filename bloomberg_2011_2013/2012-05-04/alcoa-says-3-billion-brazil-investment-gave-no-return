Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, said returns on $3 billion of investments in Brazil
“have not yet come” because of “unbelievably high” energy
costs.  “We’ve invested $3 billion there and frankly the returns
have not yet come,” Alcoa Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld said today in Pittsburgh, speaking at the company’s
annual shareholders’ meeting. Losses in the South American
country are “partly due to the unbelievably high energy
costs,” he said.  Alcoa, the second-largest aluminum producer in Brazil, said
March 31 it’s considering curtailing output at its Pocos de
Caldas and Sao Luis smelters in the country. In January, it
asked the government for assistance in lowering energy costs.  “We really have to change how we operate in Brazil,”
Kleinfeld said.  Alcoa  dropped  2.2 percent to $9.37 at the close in New
York. The shares have declined 46 percent in the past year, the
largest drop on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  To contact the reporters on this story:
