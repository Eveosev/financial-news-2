Germany  may fund more solar-energy
research to soften the impact of subsidy cuts this year,

Minister Katherina Reiche.  The government is considering investing in projects to
improve the integration of solar power into the countryâ€™s energy
mix, the newspaper cited Reiche as saying.  Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen will next week
present the plan to governors who are set to vote on the subsidy
cuts on May 11 in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament,
