“Marvel’s The Avengers,”  Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) ’s new superhero movie, took in $18.7 million in midnight
sales at U.S. and Canadian theaters.  The debut was the eighth-best among top films for midnight
openings, Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The movie, featuring Marvel superheros, including “Iron
Man,” “Thor” and “ Captain America ,” “The Avengers,” is
forecast to generate as much as $170 million in weekend sales, a
figure that would break the record of $169.2 million set last
year by the final “Harry Potter” movie. The film already has
taken in $304 million outside the U.S. and Canada, Disney said
in an e-mailed statement.  The midnight sales include $1.31 million from sold-out
performances on 273 Imax screens, Paul Pflug, a Principal
Communications Group spokesman for  Imax Corp. (IMAX) , said in an e-
mail.  In the film, the superheros unite to battle an army led by
the evil Norse god Loki. The movie is benefiting from the
popularity of previous films based on the characters, including
Robert Downey Jr.’s two “ Iron Man ” movies and last year’s
“Thor,” which also featured Loki.  To contact the reporter on this story:
