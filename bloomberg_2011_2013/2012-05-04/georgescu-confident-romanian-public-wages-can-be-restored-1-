Romania ’s designated Finance Minister
Florin Georgescu said he is confident the new government will be
able to restore public wages after they were cut as part of the
previous administration’s austerity measures.  The move won’t break the parameters of the Balkan nation’s
loan agreement with the  International Monetary Fund  and the
European Union, he told reporters in Bucharest today.  “There will be no postponements and we will not exceed the
parameters that assure the country’s stability,” Georgescu
said when asked whether the new government plans to delay a
share-sale program in state-owned assets. “The IMF loan
memorandum will be updated because some of the terms were
respected while others weren’t.”  Previous governments had pledged to sell 15 percent stakes
in state-owned Transgaz SA and Romgaz SA and 10 percent stakes
in hydro-power operator Hidroelectrica SA and nuclear-power
generator Nuclearelectrica SA this year on the Bucharest Stock
Exchange.  President Traian Basescu asked Victor Ponta to form a new
government after the three-month-old Cabinet of Mihai-Razvan
Ungureanu was ousted on April 27 in a no-confidence motion.
Ponta will be backed by his  Social Democrats  and the Liberals,
the parties that initiated the vote against the previous
administration. Lawmakers will hold a confidence vote in Ponta’s
Cabinet on May 7.  Ungureanu’s ouster took place as the IMF and the EU were
reviewing the country’s progress under a 5 billion-euro ($6.6
billion) precautionary-loan accord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
