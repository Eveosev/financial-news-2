Asian currencies fell this week by the
most in more than a month as worse-than-projected data from the
U.S. heightened concern the global recovery is stalling, damping
the outlook for the region’s exports.  India’s rupee reached the lowest since December, while
Indonesia’s rupiah dropped to a level last seen in June 2010 as
regional stocks fell to a one-week low. Reports this week showed
the euro-area jobless rate rose to 10.9 percent in March, the
highest since April 1997, and the services industry in the U.S.
grew slower than economists predicted in April as  consumer
confidence  waned. Australia’s central bank cut its growth
forecast today, citing weaker job and housing markets.  “The currency market is driven by data which has been
mixed and not pointing to a sharp recovery,” said Jackit Wong,
a regional economist at Natixis Asia Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “It
will disappoint people looking to the U.S. to compensate for a
recession in  Europe  or a slowdown in China.”  The rupee slumped 2.4 percent to 53.8350 per dollar as of
2:02 p.m. in Mumbai from a week ago, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Thailand ’s baht lost 0.7 percent to 30.98 for its
worst five-days of 2012 and the rupiah dropped 0.7 percent to
9,247 after trading as low as 9,266.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell 0.32 percent
this week, the most since a 0.33 percent drop in the period
ended March 23. Its 60-day historical volatility declined to
2.72 percent from 2.79 percent on April 27.  Job Report  The rupee’s plunge “reflects the weakening of  India ’s
fundamentals caused by the continued wide deficit in trade of
goods, and simultaneous outflows of foreign funds,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB,
wrote in a report today. “It will take either regulatory
measures or heavy central bank intervention to change the
trend.”  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management said yesterday its
non-manufacturing index fell to a four-month low of 53.5 in
April. Three Federal Reserve presidents said they don’t see the
need for a new round of bond-buying, denting prospects for
further fund inflows into emerging-market assets. The  Reserve
Bank  of Australia forecast economic growth of 3 percent for 2012,
compared with a 3.5 percent estimate in February, in its
quarterly policy statement.  China ’s yuan gained 0.06 percent to 6.3062 per dollar from
a week ago, as the U.S.-China strategic economic dialogue
continued in Beijing. Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  said
yesterday the nation will post a trade surplus of more than $10
billion in April, compared with the $9.9 billion median estimate
of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before the data due on
May 10.  China Talks  “It’s almost like a habit for China to ease tensions at
high-level meetings with the U.S. by strengthening the yuan,”
said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based currency analyst at Bank of
East Asia Ltd. “The trade surplus estimate is a surprise to the
market, providing some short-term upside to the  yuan .”  The baht fell for a third day after the Bank of Thailand
kept its benchmark  interest rate  at 3 percent on May 2. An
official report on April 30 showed the nation’s exports fell 6.8
percent in March, compared with a 1.2 percent gain the previous
month.  South  Korea ’s won closed 0.2 percent weaker today at
1,131.50 per dollar in Seoul, trimming this week’s advance to
0.3 percent. The Bank of Korea will keep its benchmark interest
rate at 3.25 percent for an 11th month at a review on May 10,
according to all nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “With weak data from the U.S., the won is halting its
recent appreciation,” said Yun Se Min, a currency trader at
Busan Bank in  Seoul .  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent this
week to NT$29.28 against its U.S. counterpart and the Philippine
peso climbed 0.1 percent to 42.32. Malaysia’s ringgit dropped
0.3 percent to 3.0412, while Vietnam’s dong advanced 0.2 percent
to 20,853.  To contact the reporters on this story:
