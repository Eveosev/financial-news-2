A PlanetSolar SA catamaran covered
with 38,000 solar cells completed the first round-the world
voyage fueled only by the sun, the expedition team said.  The MS Turanor PlanetSolar vessel pulled into Monte Carlo,
Monaco, at 2:12 p.m. local time today after a 60,006-kilometer
(37,294-mile) journey taking in 28 countries over 585 days,
PlanetSolar said in an  e-mail . The catamaran’s roof is covered
with  SunPower Corp. (SPWR)  panels that extend like wings over its
hulls, powering six blocks of  lithium-ion batteries .  The voyage demonstrates there are fossil fuel-free
alternatives other than sails to power ships across the sea as
governments try to fight  climate change  by lowering  carbon
emissions . Shipping accounts for about 3 percent of all
 greenhouse gases , according to the WWF and Oxfam groups.  “We have shown that we have the technologies as well as
the knowledge to become sustainable and safeguard our blue
planet,” expedition leader Raphael Domjan, from Switzerland,
said in the statement.  Monaco’s Prince Albert II is scheduled to board the vessel
tomorrow during three days of celebrations including a solar
light show powered by the boats’ batteries, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
