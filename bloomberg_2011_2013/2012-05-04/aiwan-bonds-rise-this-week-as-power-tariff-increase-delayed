Taiwan ’s government bonds were poised
for a third weekly gain as the government delayed an increase in
electricity prices. The local dollar strengthened for a fourth
consecutive week.  Power tariffs will climb from June 10, later than the
originally scheduled May 15, and changes will be phased in over
a period of more than six months, the government said this week.
The currency is set to conclude its longest stretch of weekly
appreciation since February after statistics bureau data showed
on April 30 the island’s economy expanded 0.36 percent in the
first quarter, compared with 1.89 percent in the last three
months of 2011.  “People are less worried about inflation now,” said  James
Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “The
economic outlook is still looking uncertain, both overseas and
in Taiwan. That’s going to support a bond rally.”  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.98
percent this week, according to Gretai Securities Market. It was
little changed today, and could test 0.95 percent this month,
according to Wang.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent this week and 0.1
percent today to NT$29.24 against its U.S. counterpart,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.08 on
May 2, the strongest level in almost eight months.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings traders use to price options, rose 66 basis points during
the five-day period to 4.29 percent. It rose four basis points
today.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  slipped one basis
point today to 0.501 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.511
percent yesterday, the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
