Magna International Inc. (MG) , a Canadian
supplier of automotive systems, was sued by a retirement fund
that accused it of misleading investors about quality control
shortcomings in its European operations and causing the stock to
fall.  The company also failed to inform investors that it had
entered into discounted contracts with European customers,
according to the complaint in the proposed class-action suit
filed today in federal in Manhattan.  Magna shares fell more than 10 percent after an August 2011
conference call with investors in which it disclosed that weak
quarterly results were the result of the European operations,
according to the suit. Magna reported quarterly net income of
$282 million, “significantly less” than Wall Street analysts
forecast, according to the complaint.  Tracy Fuerst, a Magna spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to phone and e-mail messages seeking comment on the
suit.  The case is City of Taylor General Employees Retirement
System v. Magna International, 12-3553, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  Editors:  Charles Carter , Michael Hytha  To contact the reporter on this story:
