BASF SE (BAS)  will further reduce its net
debt, which amounted to 9.4 billion euros ($12.3 billion) at the
end of the first quarter, Boersen-Zeitung reported, citing Chief
Financial Officer Hans-Ulrich Engel.  Engel said the recent authorization from shareholders for
BASF to repurchase shares is “another arrow in the quiver” to
improve the company’s cost of capital, Boersen-Zeitung reported.
BASF held almost 29 percent of its outstanding shares between
1999 and 2008, the German newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
