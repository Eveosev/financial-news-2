Oil fell below $100 a barrel for the
first time since February as U.S. employers added fewer workers
than forecast, stoking concern that demand won’t be enough to
reduce inventories from their highest level in 21 years.  Futures declined 3.9 percent after Labor Department figures
showed payrolls rose 115,000, the smallest gain in six months.
An advance of 160,000 was projected, according to the median of
85 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. Euro-region
services and manufacturing output contracted more than initially
estimated in April.  “The oil market remains focused on the economy,” said
 David Greely , head of energy research at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. in  New York . “The economic news from Europe and the U.S.
has been a little disappointing. It looks like the U.S. is
growing a little slower than we expected.”  Crude oil for June delivery tumbled $4.05 to $98.49 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Feb. 7. It was the biggest one-day drop since
Dec. 14 and capped a 6.1 percent decline for the week, the most
since September.  Brent oil for June settlement fell $2.90, or 2.5 percent,
to end the session at $113.18 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest close since Feb. 2.
The European benchmark contract’s  premium  to New York futures
widened to $14.69 from $13.54 yesterday.  The jobless rate fell to a three-year low of 8.1 percent.
The participation rate, which indicates the share of working-age
people in the  labor force , slipped to 63.6 percent, the lowest
level since December 1981.  Labor Participation  “The only reason that the jobless rate went down was that
the labor participation rate fell to the lowest level since
1981,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics
LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. “This is going
to weigh on the crude market and especially on equities.”  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries dropped to 46.7 from 49.1 in March,
London-based Markit Economics said today. That’s below an
estimate of 47.4 published on April 23.  Elections in  France ,  Greece ,  Italy  and  Germany  this weekend
may determine how the region’s governments respond to  Europe ’s
financial crisis.  French voters go to the polls May 6 in a final runoff
between President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and Socialist challenger
 Francois Hollande  and Greeks will pick a new government in a
national election the same day. There will be local elections in
Germany and Italy.  ‘Show Cracks’  “The European situation continues to be a drag on the
market,” said  Tom Bentz , a director with BNP Paribas Prime
Brokerage Inc. in New York. “There are elections this weekend
that could have a major impact on policy. The U.S., which had
been holding up pretty well, is starting to show cracks.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1.6 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell 2.4 percent,
led by crude.  Oil in New York climbed to a five-week high of $106.43 in
intraday trading May 1 after a report showed that U.S.
manufacturing increased at the fastest pace in 10 months.  “Volatility has returned to the market,” Greely said.
“We’re going to remain in a choppy range through the second
quarter and then move higher in the second half of the year as
the U.S. and Chinese economies improve.”  The fall in prices accelerated after crude broke through
technical support along its 100-day moving average, at $102.36 a
barrel today, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Buy and sell
orders tend to be clustered near chart-support levels. Futures
settled below the average for only the second time since Oct.
21. They were a penny under the indicator on April 4.  Oil Supply  U.S.  crude stockpiles  increased 2.84 million barrels to
375.9 million in the seven days ended April 27, the most since
September 1990, according to an Energy Department report May 2.
Domestic  output  gained 8,000 barrels a day to 6.12 million, the
highest level since November 1999.  Gasoline consumption  fell 0.3 percent to an average 8.66
million barrels a day in the four weeks ended April 27, leaving
demand 4.7 percent lower than a year earlier.  “We’re now focused on weak demand and high inventory
levels,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “Sobriety has
returned to the market with  Iran  tension easing. Oil above $100
is not sustainable with the economy in this condition.”  Oil in New York has fallen 11 percent from a March 1
intraday peak of $110.55 a barrel as tensions have eased between
Iran and Western nations over the country’s nuclear program.  ‘Psychological Number’  “Falling below $100 will have a major impact on  consumer
confidence  as it signals some relief from high prices,” said
 John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based
hedge fund that focuses on energy. “This is the biggest
psychological number on the board for both investors and
consumers,”  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 7.42 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.9758 a gallon in New York, the lowest settlement
since Feb. 10.  The national average retail price of unleaded regular
gasoline in the U.S. fell 0.1 cent to $3.802 a gallon yesterday,
according to a daily survey by AAA, the country’s largest
motoring organization. That’s down from $3.936 on April 4.  Electronic trading volume of crude oil on the Nymex was
825,823 contracts as of 4:13 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled
678,769 contracts yesterday, 9.4 percent below the three-month
average. Open interest was 1.61 million, the highest level since
May 16, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
