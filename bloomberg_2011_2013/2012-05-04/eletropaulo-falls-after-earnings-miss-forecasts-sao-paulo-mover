Eletropaulo Metropolitana Eletricidade
de Sao Paulo SA, the Brazilian utility unit of  AES Corp. (AES) , had
the biggest drop in two weeks after earnings fell more than
analysts forecast.  Eletropaulo  fell  4.2 percent to 28.47 reais in Sao Paulo
trading, the most since April 17. The Bovespa benchmark index
 fell  2.1 percent.  The Sao Paulo-based electricity company posted net income
of 110.2 million reais ($57.4 million) in the first quarter,
down 61 percent from 281.9 million reais a year earlier,
according to a regulatory filing yesterday. The result missed
the 199 million reais average forecast of seven analysts
 surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Eletropaulo also said it may record expenses of 212 million
reais per quarter in coming periods due to tariff parameters
released by Aneel, the country’s energy regulator.  Aneel proposed on April 10 that Eletropaulo lower its
tariffs by 8.81 percent. The change is subject to a public
hearing.  “The company’s results were weaker than our (and
consensus) forecasts,” Santander analysts Marcio Prado, Danilo Vitti and Carolina Carneiro wrote in a report to clients. “We
maintain our negative view on the name, as we foresee a
significant negative impact on Ebitda following the tariff
revision and downside risk relative to our estimates.”  The analysts rate the stock the equivalent of sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
