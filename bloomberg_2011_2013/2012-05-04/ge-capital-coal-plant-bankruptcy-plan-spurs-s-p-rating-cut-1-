GE Capital  Corp. is weighing a
prepackaged bankruptcy for the debt issuer on a coal-fired power
plant being taken back from Edison Mission Energy, spurring
 Standard & Poor’s  to cut the rating on $640 million of notes.  Debt issued by Homer City Funding LLC for the  Pennsylvania 
plant was reduced by two levels to CC, S&P said in a statement
today. That rating, 10 grades below investment quality, means
bonds are “currently highly vulnerable” to default, according
to S&P’s definitions.  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s GE Capital plans to exchange the
debt for new bonds that allow for interest payments to be made
in cash or additional debt from Oct. 1, 2012, to April 1, 2014,
according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
yesterday.  Homer City Funding would be the entity involved in any
prepackaged bankruptcy, according to the  SEC filing .  The plant in Homer City, Pennsylvania, is owned by GE
Capital and was leased by Edison Mission Energy. The companies
agreed March 29 to transfer control to GE Capital and estimated
that upgrades needed to meet new environmental regulations may
cost as much as $750 million.  Discussions began after Edison Mission failed to find
outside financing for the improvements. GE Capital hired a unit
of Kiewit Corp. to oversee the work and spent $50 million
through May 1, with as much as $40 million of monthly costs
projected for the rest of 2012, according to the SEC filing.  The $466 million of 8.734 percent notes due in October 2026
fell 0.875 cent to 99.75 cents on the dollar at 4:47 p.m. in  New
York , according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The yield was 8.763
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
