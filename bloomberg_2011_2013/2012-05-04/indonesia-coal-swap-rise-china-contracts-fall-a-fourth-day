Swaps contracts gained for lower-
quality coal from  Indonesia , according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte Ltd. Contracts for  China  deliveries fell for the
fourth day.  The June 2012 contract for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal
with a heating value of 4,900 kilocalories per kilogram rose 20
cents yesterday to $75.60 a metric ton, according to data from
Ginga, an energy broker. The swap for the third quarter of 2012
increased 45 cents to $75.30. Indonesia is the world’s biggest
exporter of thermal coal.  Swaps contracts for China coal fell yesterday. Coal with a
heating value of 5,500 kilocalories per kilogram delivered to
South China for June dropped 95 cents to $100.25 a ton, Ginga
said. The swap for the third quarter declined $1.55, or 1.4
percent, to $99.75 a ton.  Coal for  Asia ’s power stations is unlikely to get a boost
from warmer weather this year in China as the nation’s slowing
economy eases the strain on its generators and curbs imports of
the fuel. Thermal coal price at the Australian port of Newcastle
fell below $100 a ton last week for the first time since October
2010.  Newcastle coal price may drop to $95 a ton in June and July
on ample supply,  Bob Kamandanu , chairman of the Indonesian Coal
Mining Association, said yesterday in Jakarta.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating, or spot price, is exchanged for a fixed rate over a
specified contract period.  Sub-bituminous coal has higher moisture levels and lower
carbon content, reducing the heating value compared with grades
with a higher value, such as the 6,700 kilocalories-per-kilogram
grade from Newcastle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
