IG Metall ,  Germany ’s biggest
manufacturing-industry union, reported a 69 percent jump in the
number of workers taking part in short strikes to pressure
employers to increase pay and hiring.  More than 270,000 workers have participated in temporary
walkouts in the German electronics and metal industries from the
start of protests on April 30 until mid-afternoon today,
Frankfurt-based IG Metall said in a statement today. That
compares with 160,000 who took part as of yesterday.  The protests started in the southwestern German state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, where companies such as  Daimler AG (DAI) , Porsche
SE and  Robert Bosch GmbH  are based and where the union is
focusing on talks with the metal-industry employers association
as the benchmark region for contracts nationwide. Walkouts and
rallies took place today in most states,  IG Metall  said.  IG Metall is demanding a wage increase of 6.5 percent, more
say over temporary employment and guarantees of permanent
contracts for young people who complete apprenticeships.
 Suedwestmetall , the Baden-Wuerttemberg employers’ group, is
offering a 3 percent raise. Talks are scheduled to resume on May
8 and may continue on May 15, according to the union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
