U.K. stocks  tumbled the most in more
than four weeks after a U.S. jobs report missed forecasts and as
investors awaited elections in Europe this weekend.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  led a selloff in mining shares, falling 3.3
percent.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  lost 5.7 percent as crude oil tumbled
and partner Kosmos Energy Ltd. abandoned a well off the coast of
Ghana. Shares of builders declined as  house prices  fell the most
in 1 1/2 years.  The FTSE 100 Index declined 1.9 percent to 5,655.06 at the
close in London, its biggest drop since April 10. That extended
the benchmark measure’s loss this week to 2.1 percent. The FTSE
All-Share Index fell 2.1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index sank 2.8 percent.  U.K. stocks extended losses after a Labor Department report
showed that employers in the U.S. added fewer workers in April
than forecast, underscoring concern that the world’s largest
economy may be slowing.  “The immediate market reaction was to shy away from shares
and risk asset classes,” said Joshua Raymond, a market
strategist at  City Index . The data “strengthens concerns that
jobs growth may have topped out earlier in the year.”  U.S. payrolls climbed 115,000, their smallest gain in six
months. They increased a revised 154,000 in March, more than the
Labor Department initially estimated. The median economist
estimate surveyed by Bloomberg News had called for a 160,000
advance last month.  Elections in Europe  Elsewhere, four elections this weekend have the potential
to reshape Europe’s political map. Greece will pick a new
government, while polls show the French will probably install
Francois Hollande as the country’s first Socialist president
since  Francois Mitterrand  in 1995. Italy and Germany will hold
local elections.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  has lost 5.2 percent since reaching its 2012
high on March 16 amid renewed concern that the euro area’s
policy makers have yet to contain the debt crisis.  Antofagasta dropped 3.3 percent to 1,072 pence, extending
its  slump this week  to 11 percent. The copper producer yesterday
reported a 13 percent decline in first-quarter output.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  retreated 3.9 percent to 1,918 pence as
copper fell after the U.S. payrolls report.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) 
tumbled 6.2 percent to 774 pence and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  slipped 3.1
percent to 1,131.5 pence.  Oil tumbled 4 percent in  New York  to below $100 a barrel.
 BG Group Plc (BG/)  slid 4.3 percent to 1,364 pence. Royal Dutch Shell
Group Plc,  Europe’s largest oil producer , lost 2 percent to
2,142 pence, while  BP Plc (BP/)  lost 3.1 percent to 422.15 pence.  Tullow Declines  Tullow Oil dropped 5.7 percent to 1,469 pence after Kosmos
said it will plug and abandon the Teak-4A appraisal well off
Ghana’s coast. The well “encountered thin, non-commercial
reservoirs,” the U.S. oil explorer said.  In November, Kosmos said the Teak prospect extended farther
than it had thought. Kosmos, with a 30.9 percent interest,
operates the West Cape Three Points Block, which includes Teak-
4A. Other partners include Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Sabre Oil &
Gas Holdings Ltd. and Ghana National Petroleum Corp.  Builders also declined after a Halifax report showed U.K.
 house prices  fell 2.4 percent in April.  Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) 
tumbled 7.5 percent to 124.3 pence,  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  slid 5.8
percent to 589.5 pence and  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  sank 7.7 percent to
47.69 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
