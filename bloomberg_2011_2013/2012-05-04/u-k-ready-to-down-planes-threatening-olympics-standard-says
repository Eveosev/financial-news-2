Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said
U.K. ministers are prepared to order the shooting-down of a
hijacked airliner if it presents a Sept. 11-style terror threat
to the  London  Olympics, the Evening Standard newspaper reported.  “The decision to engage would be made at the highest
levels of government,” Hammond told the newspaper in an
interview published today. “I’m certainly prepared to make
decisions.”  Britain’s armed forces have been mounting exercises around
London this week to rehearse security for the games, which open
on July 27. Anti-aircraft missile batteries will be located
around London, while Typhoon jets have flown practice sorties
from a Royal Air Force base in northwest London.  “Anyone who is thinking malign thoughts should be aware
that there will be the latest and most sophisticated military
hardware ready and able to defend the games,” the Standard
cited Hammond as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
