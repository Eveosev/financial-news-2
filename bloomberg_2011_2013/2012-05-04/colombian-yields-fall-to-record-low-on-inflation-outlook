Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds held
at a record low ahead of a report tomorrow forecast to show
inflation remains in check.  The yield on Colombia’s 11.25 percent peso-denominated debt
due in October 2018 held at 6.59 percent, according to the
central bank. That’s the lowest level on a closing basis since
the debt was issued in 2008.  “Inflation expectations have dropped significantly and
people are betting inflation will remain low,” said Camilo Contreras, an analyst at Ultrabursatiles SA brokerage in Bogota.  Annual inflation quickened to 3.45 percent in April, within
the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target, from 3.40
percent in March, according to the median estimate of 24
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The national statistics agency
will release the monthly report tomorrow at noon local time.  The gap between yields on government inflation-indexed
bonds due 2013 and similar-maturity fixed-rate debt, a gauge of
annual consumer price increase expectations, fell to a record
low of 2.47 percentage points on April 26, from 4.07 on Feb. 17.
It stood at 2.61 percentage points today.  Colombia’s peso weakened 0.1 percent to 1,758.70 per  U.S.
dollar , from 1,756.45 yesterday. It posted a third weekly gain,
rising 0.3 percent in the past five days. The peso has rallied
10.2 percent this year, the second-best performance after the
Hungarian forint among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Dollar Purchases  In a bid to ease the local currency’s rally, the central
bank said on April 30 it will buy a minimum of $20 million daily
in the  spot market  until at least Nov. 2, extending the program
by three months.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in an interview
on April 13 that Colombia should use a “diverse set of
instruments” to halt the peso’s gains to protect jobs.  Echeverry’s comments “are making it difficult” for the
peso to strengthen beyond 1,750, said Contreras.  “Foreign investment continues to flow in,” Contreras
said. “The fundamentals point to a stronger peso, but investors
are wary we may see further intervention” to ease the local
currency’s rally, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
