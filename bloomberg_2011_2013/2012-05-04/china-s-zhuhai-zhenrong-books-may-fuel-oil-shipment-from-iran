Zhuhai Zhenrong Co., the Chinese
company censured by the U.S. in January for trading with Iran,
provisionally hired an oil tanker to carry  fuel oil  from the
 Persian Gulf  nation, shipping data showed.  Tianbao, a unit of state-owned Zhuhai Zhenrong, chartered
the Khorfakkan to load 80,000 metric tons on May 15 from the
Iranian port of Bandar Mahshahr, according to three shipbrokers
including Poten & Partners Inc. in  New York . The Liberia-flagged
vessel is under way in the Persian Gulf, transmissions captured
by  IHS Inc. (IHS)  on Bloomberg show.  Fuel oil is a residual product of refining used for power
generation and as shipping fuel. Two phone calls to Zhuhai
Zhenrong’s office in Beijing weren’t answered. Provisional
fixtures are subject to changes or cancellation.  China is the largest importer of Iran’s oil, buying 22
percent of the nation’s crude exports in the first half of 2011,
according to the latest available data from the U.S.  Energy
Department .  Iran  faces a European Union embargo on the
transportation, purchase, financing and insurance of its oil
starting July 1 because of its nuclear program.  Zhuhai Zhenrong was one of three companies  sanctioned  on
Jan. 12 by the State Department for selling gasoline to Iran. It
was barred from receiving U.S. export licenses or loans of more
than $10 million from U.S. financial institutions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
