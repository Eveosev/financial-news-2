Iran is poised to lose at least
192,000 barrels a day of crude-supply contracts, or about 9.5
percent of its global exports, as Asian buyers curb purchases
amid western sanctions targeting the nation’s oil trade.  Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL)  and Essar Oil
Ltd.,  India ’s biggest buyers of Iranian crude, and  China 
International United Petroleum & Chemical Co. have reduced or
plan to cut purchases from the Islamic Republic by as much as 15
percent. China and India are Iran’s largest customers.  In  Japan , the only Asian country to get an exemption from
U.S. sanctions after it demonstrated reductions in purchases,
Cosmo Oil Co. plans to cut imports by 25 percent, while JX
Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. suspended talks with the Persian Gulf
nation over a 10,000 barrel-a-day contract.  The international measures are an attempt to compel the
Middle East producer to curtail its nuclear program that the
U.S. and the European Union say is a cover for making atomic
weapons.  Iran  says it’s for civilian use.  The sanctions, aimed at reducing Iran’s oil revenue, have
made it difficult for Asian buyers to make payments in foreign
currencies, find banks willing to route transactions, and secure
insurance cover for crude shipments.  Iran exported an average of 2 million barrels a day of oil
in the first six months of 2011, according to figures from the
 Joint Organizations Data Initiative . Asian nations purchased
about 62 percent of Iranian supplies during the period,
according to  data  from the U.S. government.  The following is a summary of Iranian crude supplies to
Asian refiners and traders in 2011 and the status of 2012 supply
contracts, based on government statements, customs data, press
reports, and interviews with company officials. The contracts
are subject to revisions that may not be announced by the
companies.  CHINA (Imports from Iran in 2011: 557,000 barrels a day)  China is the world’s largest buyer of Iranian crude and
opposes trade restrictions on Iran. The Ministry of  Foreign
Affairs  said sanctions on its oil exports aren’t
“constructive,” Xinhua News Agency reported Jan. 26.  Iran’s oil shipments to China fell for a fourth month in
March to the lowest in 22 months after delays in signing term
supply contracts. Imports fell 6.2 percent to 1.08 million
metric tons, or about 254,000 barrels a day, according data from
the Beijing-based General Administration of Customs.  China International United Petroleum & Chemical, or Unipec,
delayed signing a new term contract for this year because of
payment issues. The company cut 2012 term contract purchases by
15 percent from the 265,000 to 280,000 barrels a day it bought
in 2011.  INDIA (Imports from Iran in 2011: 350,000 barrels a day)  India will continue to buy Iranian oil, according to Oil
Minister S. Jaipal Reddy, Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  and
Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai.  The second-biggest importer of Iran’s crude has set up a
rupee account at a state-owned bank to settle as much as much as
45 percent of its oil bill with Iran, and is considering
bartering some commodities for supplies, according to Indian
officials.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  may impose sanctions on India
if it doesn’t reduce purchases of Iranian oil, U.S.
administration officials said March 14. While India hasn’t asked
its refiners to stop purchasing Iranian crude, the government
has told processors to seek alternative supplies and gradually
reduce dependence on the Persian Gulf state, three Indian
officials with direct knowledge of the situation said March 15.  Mangalore Refinery, which has renewed its contract to buy
from Iran, plans to cut contract volumes for the 12 months
ending March 2013 to 120,000 barrels a day, down from 143,000
barrels a day the previous year, a person with knowledge of the
contract said in March.  Essar Oil Ltd. (ESOIL) , which has a contract to buy about 100,000
barrels a day of Iranian oil, will purchase about 85 percent to
90 percent of the agreed volumes, two people with knowledge of
the plan said May 2.  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. renewed its 60,000 barrel-a-day
contract with Iran, according to a company official who declined
to be identified because the information is confidential.  Indian Oil Corp. was planning to renew its 30,000 barrel-a-
day contract, P.K. Goyal, director of finance, said Feb. 13. The
company has been hiring ships to transport crude from Iran.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. has a contract to buy 20,000 barrels
a day. It may end the imports and buy crude from other sources
if it becomes difficult to obtain shipping insurance after July,
a company official said.  JAPAN (Imports from Iran in 2011: 313,000 barrels a day)  Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry asked
refiners on March 21 to make reductions as business allows,
according to a ministry official who declined to be identified
because of internal policy. METI didn’t and won’t ask for
specific volumes to be cut, the official said.  The country’s imports from Iran surged to the highest level
in a year in March. Shipments climbed 42 percent to 1.8 million
kiloliters, or about 355,000 barrels a day, compared with 1.2
million kiloliters in February, according to data from the
Ministry of Finance on April 26. Imports were 6.3 percent below
purchases in March 2011.  JX Energy, which has a January-to-December contract for
83,000 barrels a day, suspended talks to renew an additional

April, a company official who declined to be identified because
of internal policy said on April 9.  Cosmo Oil Co. (5007)  will cut Iranian crude imports by 25 percent
this year, a company official said Feb. 8. The Japanese refiner,
partly owned by the government of  Abu Dhabi , signed an annual

day, Katsuhisa Maeda, a Tokyo-based spokesman, said. That’s down
from 40,000 barrels a day last year.  Showa Shell Sekiyu was finishing talks on reducing its
contract for about 100,000 barrels a day for the fiscal year
started April 1, Satoshi Yoshida, a company spokesman, said

to comment on negotiations April 9.  Toyota Tsusho Corp. (8015)  hasn’t renewed a contract with Iran for
the supply of 5,000 barrels a day of crude, said two people with
knowledge of the company’s purchases.  The contract was for supplies from April to March 2013,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
the information is confidential. The trader still has another
contract running from January to December for almost 40,000
barrels a day, according to one of the people.  SOUTH KOREA  (Imports from Iran in 2011: 239,000 barrels a day)  The government said it will make a decision on cutting
Iranian crude imports by the end of June. A South Korean
delegation visited the U.S. from Feb. 21 to Feb. 24 to discuss
Iran sanctions.  Iranian imports fell 22 percent to 17.7 million barrels in
the first three months of this year from the same period last
year, according to data from state-run Korea National Oil Corp.  SK Innovation Co. and  Hyundai Oilbank  are the only South
Korean refiners that purchase Iranian crude.  SK Innovation, South Korea’s biggest refiner, is consulting
with the South Korean government on the reduction of purchases
while it hasn’t been determined how much is to be cut, Jo Eun
Kee, the head of the corporate planning office at SK, said April
27. Iranian crude accounts for 10 percent to 15 percent of the
Seoul-based refiner’s monthly purchasing volumes, Jo said.  Hyundai Oilbank bought 70,000 barrels a day from Iran in
2011, about one-sixth of its total purchases. Crude imports from
the country accounted for about 20 percent of Hyundai’s total
March imports, compared with 30 percent in 2011, the Seoul
Economic Daily reported March 19, citing a company document.  MALAYSIA (Petronas’ Engen unit imports from Iran before
suspension: 65,000 barrels a day)  Petronas’ Engen unit in  South Africa  suspended purchases.
Engen operates the country’s second-biggest refinery, which is

its dependence on Iran, Susil Premajayantha, its oil minister,
said April 24.  The island nation, which imports 13 of its 14 annual crude

It would like to double purchases from  Saudi Arabia  to 2 lots,
and obtain 2 consignments from Oman, the minister said.  TAIWAN (Imports from Iran in 2011: 30,000 barrels a day)  Taiwan buys less than 4 percent of its crude from Iran,

December. The company will continue taking delivery until July,
Lin said.  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  has renewed its 2012 term
