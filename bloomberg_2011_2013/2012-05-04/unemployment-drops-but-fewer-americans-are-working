By one measure,  today's jobs report  is particularly disappointing: It marks the second month in a row that the employed share of the  U.S. population  has fallen. The Labor Department  reported  that as of April, 58.4 percent of the U.S. population was gainfully employed. That's down from 58.6 percent in February, and exactly where the employment-to-population ratio stood a year ago. The decline reflects the fact that job gains aren't keeping up with  population growth . It also demonstrates the illusory nature of April's reduction in the unemployment rate, to 8.1 percent from 8.2 percent in March. The Labor Department, in its monthly household survey, counts people as unemployed only if they're in the  labor force , meaning they're actively looking for work. In April, the estimated number of people in the labor force fell by 342,000. So the  unemployment rate  fell, too, even though the survey counted 169,000 fewer people with jobs. What can U.S. policy makers do about the weak labor market? Congress isn't likely to provide more fiscal stimulus, as Bloomberg View editors  point out today . That leaves the Fed to at least protect what meager gains we've made. (Mark Whitehouse is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
