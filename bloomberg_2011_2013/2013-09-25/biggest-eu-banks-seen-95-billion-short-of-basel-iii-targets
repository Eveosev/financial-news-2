The largest European banks would
have had a shortfall of 70.4 billion euros ($95 billion) at the
end of 2012 if Basel III rules had been implemented, the
European Union’s top banking regulator said.  The EU’s 42 biggest banks would have had to raise the
amount to reach a capital ratio of 7 percent of assets weighted
for risk, the minimum level allowed for larger banks under Basel
rules scheduled to be implemented globally by 2019.  The banks have boosted their capital levels by 29 billion
euros since June 2012, the  European Banking Authority , set up in
2011 to harmonize banking rules across the trading bloc, said in
a report published on its website today.  “Given these results, an additional effort by banks to
fulfill the risk-based  capital requirements  is expected,
although part of the initial shortfall has already been covered
since the last reporting date,” the EBA said in the study.  Global banks have raised about $500 billion in capital in
the aftermath of the financial crisis and fall of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. five years ago and are moving closer to
complying with global capital rules known as Basel III,  Mark Carney , chairman of the  Financial Stability Board  and governor
of the  Bank of England , said in a speech last month.  The 42 EU banks had an average  leverage ratio , the level of
debt funding to equity, of 2.9 percent, the EBA said. The
lenders who haven’t reached the Basel minimum level of 3 percent
will need to raise 106 billion euros by 2018.  Large international banks, including those outside of the
EU, had core capital reserves averaging about 9 percent of their
risk-weighted assets at the end of 2012, more than the 7 percent
required under the updated standards, the  Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision  said in a report earlier this year.  European lenders will have to hold an extra 225 billion
euros of easy-to-sell assets to meet internationally agreed
liquidity standards, according to the EBA. Under Basel rules,
banks must have a buffer of assets to fund them through a 30-day
credit crunch.
