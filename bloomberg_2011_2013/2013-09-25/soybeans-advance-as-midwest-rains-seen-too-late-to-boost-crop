Wheat futures jumped to a four-week
high on speculation that  China , the world’s biggest consumer,
will increase imports to curb record domestic prices. Corn and
soybeans also rose.  China may sell grain from stockpiles and ask state-owned
companies to import more to curb rising  prices , Shi Wei, an
analyst for Shanghai JC Intelligence Co., said today. Wheat in
central  Henan province  rose 3.4 percent this month to a record
2,760  yuan  ($451) a metric ton,  data  from China National Grain &
Oils Information Center show. China may triple imports this
year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said Sept. 12.  “Record prices in China may increase demand” for U.S.
wheat exports,  Jason Britt , the president of Central States
Commodities Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri, said in a telephone
interview. “It looks like China may become more aggressive
importing wheat.”  Wheat futures for delivery in December jumped 1.9 percent
to close at $6.705 a bushel at 1:15 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since Aug. 26. Earlier, the most-active
contract touched $6.75, the highest since Aug. 26.  Prices gained for a third day on speculation that a USDA
report this month will show Sept. 1 inventories fell 7.6 percent
from a year earlier. Traders surveyed by Bloomberg said supplies
totaled 1.945 billion bushels, on average, down from 2.105
billion a year earlier.  “Demand is sneaking up, and supplies are getting a little
smaller,” Britt said.  Corn futures for December delivery added 1.3 percent to
$4.5475 a bushel in Chicago. The most-active contract yesterday
dropped to $4.48, the lowest since Aug. 14.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$13.2175 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
