John Hallacy, who stepped down as
 Bank of America  Merrill Lynch’s head of municipal research this
year, will join bond insurer  Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO)  as a managing
director of public finance, the company said.  “This is an exciting time to join  Assured Guaranty ,”
Hallacy, 58, said in a statement from Hamilton, Bermuda-based
Assured. “The benefits of bond insurance are clearer than ever,
and its new muni-only bond insurer, Municipal Assurance Corp.,
is positioned to expand the market.”  Assured was the only company left insuring munis after  MBIA
Inc. (MBI)  and Ambac Assurance Corp. had their ratings cut during the
financial crisis amid losses on guarantees of subprime-mortgage-backed debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
