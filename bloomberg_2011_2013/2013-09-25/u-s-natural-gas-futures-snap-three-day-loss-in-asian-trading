Natural gas futures were little
changed in  New York  on speculation that a supply gain last week
may match year-earlier levels, and as traders closed out of
October futures positions before expiration tomorrow.  Gas was less than 1 percent higher before a government
report tomorrow that may show U.S. inventories rose by 79
billion cubic feet, based on the median of 16  analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Temperatures will be seasonally mild in
eastern states from Oct. 5 through Oct. 9, Commodity Weather
Group LLC said. October gas options expire today.  “The gas market has to trade through some fairly large
expected inventory builds the next three weeks,” said Brison Bickerton, head of strategy at Freepoint Commodities LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Cold-weather maps would trump those
builds, but unless those maps show up, I could see us
consolidating prices here for a while.”  Natural gas for October delivery gained 0.1 cent to settle
at $3.493 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 14 percent below the
100-day average at 3:35 p.m. Gas yesterday closed at $3.492, the
lowest level since Aug. 23. Prices are up 4.2 percent this year
and slid 2.5 percent this month.  The more active November contracts fell 1.3 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.546. The discount of November to January futures
narrowed 0.3 cent to 26.9 cents.  Gas Options  October $3.50 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 2.3 cents lower at 0.7 cent per
million Btu on volume of 1,051 at 3:38 p.m. Puts accounted for
47 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for November
at-the-money options was 30.22 percent at 3 p.m., compared with
30.23 percent yesterday.  Gas dropped below the 50-day moving average yesterday.  “It was just getting drilled so hard over the last couple
of days, there is some support here from people covering some
shorts,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York.  Inventory estimates compiled by Bloomberg ranged from gains
of 61 billion to 85 billion cubic feet. The five-year average
increase for the week ended Sept. 20 is 75 billion, data show
from the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm
of the Energy Department. Gas stockpiles totaled 3.299 trillion
cubic feet as of Sept. 13, 0.5 percent above the five-year
average.  Weekly Gains  Temperatures from the Midwest to the East Coast may be
above normal from Sept. 30 through Oct. 4 before returning to
seasonal norms in the following five days, according to
Commodity Weather Group.  “This is a bearish demand situation” because of a lack of
early-season heating demand,  Matt Rogers , president of the
Bethesda, Maryland-based forecaster, said in a note to clients
today.  The high in  Chicago  on Oct. 3 may be 66 degrees Fahrenheit
(19 Celsius), 2 below normal, said AccuWeather Inc. in  State
College ,  Pennsylvania . Atlanta’s high on Oct. 9 may be 65
degrees, 10 lower than usual.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm. About 50 percent of U.S.
households use gas for heating.  Natural gas production may rise 1.1 percent this year to a
record 69.91 billion cubic feet a day, the EIA said Sept. 10 in
its  Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The agency increased its forecast
from 69.89 billion last month.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first six months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
