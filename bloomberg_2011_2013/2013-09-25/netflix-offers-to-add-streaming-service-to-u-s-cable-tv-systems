Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  seeks to put its
streaming-video service on more cable set-top boxes, Chief
Financial Officer  David Wells  said.  The company’s service is being offered in the U.K. through
cable-TV operator Virgin Media. Netflix, based in Los Gatos,
California, has had an “open offer” to U.S. cable operators
for two years, Wells said today in an interview at an investor
conference in New York.  Netflix is “still willing” to forge more partnerships,
Wells said onstage at the event, which was sponsored by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
