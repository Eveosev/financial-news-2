Gasoline gained on speculation U.S.
inventories fell as refineries shut units for seasonal
maintenance and unplanned repairs.  Futures rose as Energy Information Administration will
probably report today that gasoline  stockpiles  declined 750,000
barrels, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg. Refinery rates fell 0.9 percentage point to
91.6 percent, the survey showed. Gasoline is down 11 percent
this month as driving season ended and refiners switch to making
winter-grade fuel, which uses cheaper blending components.  “It’s the time of year when we look for refinery
utilization to be in the low 80s, not the low 90s,” said
 Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market has sold off hard
and technically overdone to the downside so it’s not surprising
to see a little bit of firming.”  Gasoline for October delivery rose 2.39 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.6831 a gallon at 10:01 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange on trading volume that was 40 percent above
the 100-day average. Prices are down 4.6 percent this year and
2.5 percent in the third quarter.  The EIA is scheduled to report inventories at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington . Supplies of distillate fuel, including heating oil
and diesel, dropped 925,000 barrels and crude stockpiles fell 1
million barrels, according to the survey.  API Report  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported
yesterday that gasoline inventories rose 341,000 barrels and
distillate supplies increased 485,000 barrels.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened 58 cents to $8.62 a barrel, down from
$13.73 on Aug 30. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent rose 27 cents to
$2.80.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 1.4 cents to $3.447
a gallon, 36.3 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based
