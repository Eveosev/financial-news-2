BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, said rising supply will continue to
weigh on commodity prices in the short term.  Increased supply has “exerted downward pressure on many
commodity markets more recently and we expect this trend to
continue over the short term,” Jac Nasser, chairman of the
Melbourne-based company, said today in its annual report.  Mining companies are cutting costs and shedding workers
after a decade-long boom in prices, driven by the biggest
importer  China , has waned. BHP Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie cut capital spending this fiscal year as investors
including BlackRock Inc. pressure mining companies to defer
expansions and acquisitions.  “We maintain a positive outlook over the long-term as the
fundamentals of wealth creation, demographics and urbanization
continue to create demand for commodities across  Asia  and other
markets,” Nasser said, according to the report.  BHP rose 0.4 percent to A$36.02 at 10:48 a.m. in Sydney
trading. The shares have declined 3 percent since the start of
the year.  Lower prices have weighed on income, with BHP’s profit,
excluding one-time items, declining 6.9 percent to $6.8 billion
in the six months to June, while the London Metal Exchange Index
fell 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
