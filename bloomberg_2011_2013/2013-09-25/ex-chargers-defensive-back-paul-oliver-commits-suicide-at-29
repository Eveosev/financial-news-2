Former San Diego Chargers defensive
back Paul Oliver was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot
wound, police said. He was 29.  Oliver played all four of his National Football League
seasons in San Diego, with his final game in 2011. His death
comes 16 months after former Chargers linebacker Junior Seau
also committed suicide.  “Everyone in the Chargers family is sad today after
hearing the news about Paul,” the Chargers said yesterday in a
statement. “At just 29 years old, he still had a lifetime in
front of him. Right now all of our thoughts and prayers are with
his family during this most difficult time.”  Oliver’s body was found two days ago at his home in
Marietta,  Georgia , according to a Cobb County Police Department
report. Police said the Cobb County medical examiner’s office
confirmed the cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  Oliver, who played collegiately at the University of
Georgia, was selected by the Chargers with a fourth-round pick
in the 2007 supplemental draft. He appeared in 57 games, with 12
starts, from 2008 through 2011 and had four interceptions and
one fumble return for a touchdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
