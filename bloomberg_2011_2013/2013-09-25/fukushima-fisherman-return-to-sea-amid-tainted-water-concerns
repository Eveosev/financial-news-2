A fleet of more than 20 boats set
out today from north of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power
plant after fishermen lifted a suspension imposed in late August
amid concerns about contaminated water.  Fishery cooperative leaders reached the decision for test
fishing at a meeting yesterday in Fukushima, Tadaaki Sawada, an
official at the Fukushima Prefectural Federation of Fisheries
Co-operative  Association , said by phone. The decision came after
no radioactive materials were found in sea water in tests
conducted by the Fukushima prefecture, according to the
official.  Fishermen in the Soma Futaba area have restarted fishing,
Sawada said. Two other cooperatives from Iwaki and Onahama will
start fishing on a test basis on Oct. 3, the first time since
the March 2011 earthquake, according to Sawada.  The catch will be limited to 16 types of marine life,
including squid and octopus.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , the utility responsible for the
Fukushima nuclear plant, is working to stem the leak of
contaminated groundwater into the  Pacific Ocean , which the
government has estimated at about 300 metric tons per day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
