Former  VeriFone (PAY)  Systems Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Douglas Bergeron has partnered with private-equity firm  GTCR  to invest as much as $500 million to buy
financial-industry assets and companies.  The partnership, called Opus Global Holdings LLC, plans to
use acquisitions to build a company focused on payments, risk-and-compliance services and trading systems, Bergeron said in an
interview. Opus plans to buy assets from financial institutions
and may also consider assets from VeriFone, a maker of credit-card and debit-card terminals, he said.  “Anything is possible, if they had a business we thought
was interesting,” said Bergeron, 52, who will serve as Opus’s
chairman and CEO in  Palo Alto ,  California . “In the future, if
VeriFone stumbles further, I don’t want to exclude VeriFone,
either.”  GTCR plans to put as much as $450 million in Opus, Bergeron
said, adding that he will invest as much as $50 million in the
venture. Opus, which has discussed joining forces with other
private-equity firms, could target companies worth as much as
several billion dollars, he said.  VeriFone has lost about  half  its value since April 2012
because of product delays, among other reasons. Some analysts
have said VeriFone is an acquisition target for private equity.  Andy Payment, a spokesman at VeriFone, declined to comment.  VeriFone’s Path  Bergeron grew VeriFone after helping Gores Technology Group
acquire the unit from  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  Bergeron was CEO of
VeriFone from 2001 until earlier this year, when the board
dismissed him after the  San Jose , California-based company
missed estimates for second-quarter profit. He is VeriFone’s
largest individual shareholder with a 0.75 percent stake,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bergeron has worked with GTCR before, notably in 2002 when
he received backing from GTCR Golder Rauner LLC to expand
VeriFone. GTCR, a Chicago-based private-equity firm, manages
more than $8 billion. Since 1980, it has invested more than $10
billion in more than 200 companies, according to its website.  Bergeron is also a co-investor and board member of  Fundtech
Inc. , a New York-based transaction-banking systems company that
was acquired by GTCR in 2011.  Opus plans to take advantage of increased fragmentation of
the financial industry, and large corporate clients’ desire to
work with service providers with a variety of offerings,
Bergeron said.  “It’s a fundamentally great business,” Bergeron said.
“It might look like a checkered collection of assets, but the
idea is to become the next great financial technology
business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
