U.K. retail sales  rose at the
fastest pace in 15 months in September, boosted by grocery and
furniture stores, according to an index by the  Confederation of
British Industry .  A gauge of annual sales growth increased to 34, the highest
since June 2012, from 27 in August, the London-based lobby said
today. Economists had forecast a drop to 23, according to the
median of nine estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Retailers
expect sales to maintain their momentum next month.  “It’s encouraging to see the high street on the road to
recovery,” said Barry Williams, chief merchandising officer for
food at  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Asda unit and chairman of the CBI
retail panel. “But the retail sector is not out of the woods
yet with  consumer confidence  still fragile.”  A gauge of the volume of orders placed with suppliers
climbed to 14 in September from 10 in August and a measure of
sales volumes for the time of year rose to 12 from 10. A three-month moving average of sales jumped to 26 from 15.  The CBI’s survey of 61 retailers was conducted between Aug.
28 and Sept. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
