Gulf Navigation Holding (GULFNAV)  surged to
the highest in almost three years after Dubai’s only publicly
traded oil-vessel owner said it plans to sell a supertanker.  The  shares  soared 13 percent to 43.9 fils at the close in
Dubai, the strongest level since January 2011. The stock has
climbed 47 percent since Sept. 22, when Gulf Navigation said its
board recommended a capital increase as well as the sale of a
very large crude carrier. The company also recommended raising
foreign ownership limits.  The share price has been supported by Gulf Navigation’s
plans to exit the oil shipping industry, where rates have
declined to the point that “they don’t cover the operating
costs anymore,” said Alaa Ghanem, lead analyst at Beirut-based
Audi Saradar Investment Bank. “Investors took the news as a
positive sign as the company remains in the petrochemicals
shipping sector, which is very profitable.”  The company said Sept. 16 that its supertanker Gulf Sheba
was detained at Port Rotterdam because of a “default in
repayment of interest and principal toward end of July 2013.”
Gulf Navigation also said it has been discussing proposals from
prospective buyers for the sale of the vessel.  More than 300 million Gulf Navigation shares were traded
today, almost six times the three-month daily average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock was the  third-biggest 
gainer on the benchmark DFM General Index, which rose 0.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
