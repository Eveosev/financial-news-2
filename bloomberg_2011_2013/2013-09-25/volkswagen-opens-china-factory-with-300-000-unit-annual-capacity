Volkswagen (VOW)  AG, Europe’s largest
automaker, opened a new factory today in the southern Chinese
province of Guangdong as it seeks to overtake  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) 
to become the industry’s biggest company by deliveries.  The plant, set up with Chinese partner FAW CAR Co. in the
city of Foshan, has an initial capacity to produce 300,000 units
a year, Volkswagen said in an e-mailed statement. Capacity will
double in the factory’s second phase, it said.  Volkswagen said in March it planed to increase its
production in  China  60 percent by 2018. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based company’s sales in China surged by almost half last year
and boosted its share of the country’s passenger vehicle market
this year by 3 percentage points to 22 percent by the end of
August.  The Foshan plant, which will produce new Golf model cars,
will create 6,500 jobs in its first phase, according to the
statement. Volkswagen delivered 2.05 million vehicles in China
during the first eight months, 17.9 percent more than a year
earlier, the company said.  The carmaker announced in April that it plans to expand its
model line-up in China by 29 percent by 2015. Volkswagen aims to
offer 90 cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and heavy trucks in
the world’s biggest vehicle market compared with about 70 models
now. VW is targeting at least 3 million deliveries in China this
year,  Jochem Heizmann , head of the carmaker’s Chinese
operations, said in April.  China, already VW’s biggest national market, may expand to
account for 37 percent of the German carmaker’s global volume in
2015 from 28 percent in 2010, according to LMC Automotive
research company.  VW’s 9.8 billion-euro project to build factories and
develop models in China by 2018 will be the country’s largest-ever automotive-investment program, Chief Executive Officer
Martin Winterkorn said in April. The company will expand its
workforce by 33 percent to more than 100,000 employees in the
period, according to the carmaker.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
