BHP Billiton , the world’s biggest
mining company, raised $5 billion in its first sale of U.S.
dollar-denominated bonds in 19 months.  The coal and iron ore producer’s finance unit issued $500
million each of three-year, floating-rate notes to yield 25
basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered
rate and 2.05 percent, five-year debentures to yield 70 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It also sold $1.5 billion of 3.85
percent, 10-year debt at a relative yield of 125 basis points
and $2.5 billion of 5 percent, 30-year securities at a 130
basis-point spread.  The miner last sold dollar debt in February 2012 with a
$5.25 billion issue in five parts, Bloomberg data show. Its $1
billion of 2.875 percent securities due February 2022 traded on
Sept. 20 at 94.37 cents on the dollar to yield 3.66 percent,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The debt is expected to be rated A1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction
who asked not to be identified citing lack of authorization to
speak publicly. Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the offering for the  dual listed 
company, which has its global headquarters in  Melbourne .  To contact the reporter on this story:
