Copper advanced for the first time
in four days on speculation that demand in  China , the world’s
biggest consumer, will recover after next week’s holidays.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 0.6 percent to $7,192.75 a metric ton
and traded at $7,172 by 11:23 a.m. in  Tokyo . Copper increased 1
percent this month and added 6.3 percent this quarter, the first
such gain in a year.  A report on Sept. 23 from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics showed manufacturing strengthened more than estimated
in China this month, mirroring an increase in August in a
similar government-produced index. Data earlier this month
showed industrial output grew in August at a faster pace.  “Prices are supported by expectations on China’s demand
outlook after several positive indicators” including
manufacturing data, said Fang Junfeng, an analyst at Shanghai
CIFCO Futures Co. “Prices will keep gaining as demand will pick
up in the fourth quarter.”  The final reading of the Chinese manufacturing PMI from
HSBC and Markit will be released Sept. 30. The National Bureau
of Statistics releases the government’s  manufacturing PMI , with
a bigger sample size, on Oct. 1.  Futures for delivery in December rose 0.2 percent to $3.262
a pound on the Comex in  New York . Metal for delivery in December
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.2 percent to 51,650  yuan 
($8,437) a ton. Markets in China are closed from Oct. 1 to Oct.
7 for National Day holidays.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc and lead also advanced, as tin
declined and nickel was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
