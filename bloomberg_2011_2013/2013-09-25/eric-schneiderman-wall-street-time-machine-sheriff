If you are an ambitious candidate for Sheriff of Wall Street, a problem you face is that, on the one hand, you need to tell everyone about how you are going after evil guys in order to level the playing field for ordinary investors, but, on the other hand, that is a very very tired metaphor. New York Attorney General and high-speed-trading data crusader Eric Schneiderman is  up to the challenge :  I but what? Why? Part of the difficulty is that everything everyone does in the financial markets is about getting some advantage over their competitors, but the misbehavior he's going after -- high-speed leaks of economic data -- confers that advantage for only a couple of milliseconds. "To put it in terms of a race, these guys are starting the race five one-thousandths of a second before the gun goes off" doesn't exactly inspire terror.* "To put it in terms of a race, these guys are supergluing their competitors' feet to the starting blocks, then sawing their legs off and hopping in a Ferrari to drive to the finish line." I don't know, embellish his metaphor at your leisure, he will. I don't want to trivialize this advantage too much: High frequency traders really can make bazillions of dollars with an advantage of a few milliseconds. On the other hand this is basically bunk: One way you can tell it's bunk is umm there are markets and they are not essentially equal. This is a true story: Many banks employ analysts who write detailed research reports that include recommendations on whether you should Buy or Sell a stock, and they give those research reports to their paying clients and  not to anyone else . Those clients are paying for an unfair advantage!** But it's not just banks. The Wall Street Journal employs journalists who find news and then make that news available only to paying subscribers. Bloomberg employs journalists who find news and then make that news available to anyone on the Internet, shortly  after  making it available only to paying Bloomberg terminal users.  The "essential equity of the markets" is bunk because the essence of the markets is inequity. You trade because you have, or think you have, better information than someone else. If everyone had the same information,  and believed that they had the same information , there would be no markets. That aside though! The five millisecond thing. Schneiderman's focus is not information asymmetries generally, but millisecond-level high-speed trading asymmetries specifically. These really are bad, in the sense that many of them seem to come from illegal leaks (and/or  time machines ), and in the sense that those who benefit from the leaks can profit rather substantially. But you gotta profit  from  someone. The mechanics are like: What lesson do you draw from this? Eric Schneiderman seems to believe that the intuitive lesson is, "you are all dumb money, never invest," so he needs to stamp it out so there can be investing:*** But this is a weird lesson to draw! The lesson is not that you are dumb for buying or selling Thing X at 1pm or 3pm or 10am, when there's no market moving data about. The lesson is that you are dumb for trying to buy or sell Thing X at 2:00:00.00whatever. Who is doing that? Mostly high frequency traders with slower time machines, one presumes.**** Humans take 300 milliseconds to blink, as  the financial press will now tell you , so all you have to do to avoid being picked off by high frequency traders with illicit access to news is  blink once  before trading. There you go! The danger has passed.  The thing is that no matter what Schneiderman does, some high frequency trading firms will be faster than others: Even if they all get the information at the same time, some will have better computers and algorithms and connections, because that's how they compete. Telling "ordinary investors," on pretty much any definition of "ordinary investors," that they should be able to compete in a fair race for milliseconds of trading profits seems irresponsible. Telling them to give up that dream and invest for the long term -- longer than a few seconds anyway! -- seems right. These high frequency front-runners are, at least, conveying that correct information. * Also how long is the race? I mean markets move fast. But they also, like, go on forever. I don't know, call it a 4x400 relay, this is not actually an interesting question.  ** Schneiderman: Oh sure! But then when they're officially released to clients the clients can front run the non-clients, who cares. *** Unlike other quotes here (which are from  that Journal article ), this is from the transcript of Schneiderman's talk at the Bloomberg summit yesterday. **** From pseudonymous finance blogger  Kid Dynamite , a while back: Possibly a bit harsh? But basically right.
