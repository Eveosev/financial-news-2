Gunvor Group Ltd., the oil trader
controlled by billionaire founders Torbjorn Tornqvist and
 Gennady Timchenko , said first-half profit rose 4.4 percent as
better margins and gains on investments offset lower revenue.  Net income climbed to $162.6 million from $155.7 million a
year earlier, Gunvor said today in a filing to the Singapore
Stock Exchange. Revenue fell 6 percent to $44.8 billion.  Closely held Gunvor is the fifth-largest independent
commodity trader, based on its 2012 full-year revenue of $93
billion. The firm, based in Cyprus and with its major trading
business run out of Geneva, handles mostly oil and oil products
and was founded in 2000 as a buyer and seller of Russian crude.  First-half operating profit rose 25 percent to $197.3
million, it said today. Gunvor sources crude oil from more than
35 countries, trading about 2.5 million barrels a day, according
to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
