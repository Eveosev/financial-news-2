The  New York Giants  signed former
New York Jets fullback John Conner as they seek a replacement
for Henry Hynoski in the National Football League’s worst
rushing offense.  The 5-foot-11, 240-pound Conner spent the preseason with
the  Cincinnati Bengals  before being released. In the season
finale of HBO Sports’ “Hard Knocks” reality show covering the
Bengals’ training camp, Conner said he was “shocked” about
being cut.  Hynoski, the Giants’ starting fullback, was placed on
season-ending injured reserve with a broken left shoulder, the
team said in an e-mailed statement. The Giants are 0-3 and
averaging 44.3 rushing yards a game, the fewest among the NFL’s
32 teams.  Conner was a fifth-round pick of the Jets in the 2010 draft
and appeared in every game for the team over his first two
seasons. Slowed by a knee sprain and a hamstring injury last
season, he was waived by the Jets in October 2012 after reaching
an injury settlement with the team. Conner later joined the
Bengals and appeared in two games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
