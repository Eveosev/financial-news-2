Canada’s dollar touched a one-week
low as the discount for crude oil sold by Canadian companies
compared with market benchmarks reached its largest since
February, limiting the economic boost from the country’s biggest
export.  The currency fell for a second day versus its U.S. peer as
politicians in  Washington  continued a standoff over legislation
to fund the government and avoid a shutdown. Americans are
losing faith in the nation’s economic recovery, according to a
Bloomberg National Poll. Consumer purchases account for about 70
percent of economic activity in the U.S., Canada’s largest
trading partner.  “For the Canadian economy it’s negative to see that spread
widen,”  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS) , said by phone from Toronto. “There’s a lot of
uncertainty right now between different proposals in Canada in
terms of how to transport oil, and that’s led to some volatility
in that spread. I don’t think those issues are resolved in the
next couple of days.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 0.1 percent to
C$1.0314 per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto after touching
C$1.0319, weakest since Sept. 17. One loonie buys 96.96 U.S.
cents.  The Canadian dollar is up 2 percent this quarter, trimming
its year-to-date drop to 3.8 percent.  Crude Discount  The  discount   Canada ’s benchmark crude oil-grade, Western
Canada Select, faced to West Texas Intermediate, its U.S. peer,
was at $30 per barrel for a second day, the most since Feb. 4.  Futures on WTI fell 0.8 percent to $102.36 per barrel after
rising as much as 0.8 percent.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government  bond  rose, with
yields falling three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
2.57 percent, the lowest point in almost a month. The 1.5
percent security maturing in June 2023 gained 21 cents to
C$90.88.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of  U.S. stocks  fell 0.3
percent.  The  U.S. Senate  unanimously advanced a stopgap spending
measure to avoid a shutdown following a 21-hour floor speech by
Senator  Ted Cruz , R-Texas, in opposition to President  Barack
Obama ’s health-care law. Republicans who control the  House of
Representatives  have promised to craft a longer-term funding
bill that will undo parts of the law. Obama has sworn to veto
any such legislation.  Market ‘Nervousness’  “The news out of the U.S. political situation is again
ramping up and causing some nervousness, and I don’t think
people necessarily know how to assess all that’s going on in the
 United States ,” said  David Watt , chief economist at the
Canadian unit of HSBC Holdings Plc. “That’s keeping markets
pretty close to home. No one really wants to get caught off
guard.”  Fewer Americans anticipate improvement in the economy’s
strength over the next year than in the last Bloomberg National
Poll in June, with 27 percent saying the expansion will be more
robust, down from 39 percent. Forty-four percent of poll
respondents say they expect the economy, which has expanded for
nine consecutive quarters, to remain about the same, while 28
percent see it weakening.  Canada’s currency rose earlier as the U.S. market for new
homes capped its weakest two-month period this year, bolstering
the case for the  Federal Reserve  to maintain monetary stimulus.  Fed policy makers last week refrained from reducing the $85
billion pace of monthly bond buying, saying the tightening of
financial conditions, if sustained, could slow the pace of
improvement in the economy. The bond-buying is thought to weaken
the U.S. currency.  The loonie is little changed this month against nine
developed nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg Correlation
Weighted Index. The Australian dollar has climbed 2.1 percent
while the  New Zealand dollar  has had the biggest increase at 3.4
percent. The U.S. dollar has dropped 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
