Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB,
 Mexico ’s third-biggest bank, plans to let its storm-afflicted
clients delay loan payments after twin hurricanes struck the
Latin American nation.  Mortgages and credit-card payments are among the products
that may qualify for pushed-back payments, Banorte’s Chief
Executive Officer Alejandro Valenzuela said today in remarks
broadcast on Radio Formula.  At least 130 people were killed by twin hurricanes that
battered Mexico on both coasts this month and caused landslides,
Interior Minister Miguel Osorio Chong said yesterday on Radio
Formula.  UBS AG (UBSN)  is donating Mexico stock brokerage commissions today
to the storm recovery effort through the charity Save the
Children, Damian Fraser, the head of the bank’s Mexico business,
said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
