Copper futures rose in  New York  for
the first time in four sessions as sales of new U.S. homes
rebounded last month, adding to signs of increasing demand for
the metal used in pipes and wiring.  Sales increased 7.9 percent to a 421,000 annualized pace,
topping analyst estimates, government figures showed today.
Global demand for refined copper exceeded production in June by
132,000 metric tons, amid signs that use in  China  climbed to the
highest since December 2011, the International Copper Study
Group said yesterday in a  report . The Asian country is the
world’s top metals consumer, followed by the U.S.  “We’re seeing copper getting a bit of a bounce off of the
new-home sales numbers,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “People
have been worried whether housing sales would go down with
rising interest rates, and any sign that demand is holding up is
a positive for copper.”  Copper futures for delivery in December rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $3.272 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The metal slipped 2.7 percent in the previous three sessions.
Prices have climbed 7 percent since June, on track for the first
quarterly gain in a year.  House prices  in 20 U.S. cities gained the most in more than
seven years in the 12 months through July, a private report
showed yesterday. Construction generates about 40 percent of
demand for the metal, according to the Copper Development
Association.  Supplies will exceed demand this year by about 150,000
tons, with the surplus widening to 620,000 tons in 2014, Societe
Generale SA said this month.  “When you look at the micro fundamentals for copper, there
is more to worry about,”  Gayle Berry , an analyst at Barclays
Plc in  London , said by telephone today. “You are looking at a
market moving into surplus toward the end of the year.”  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months added 0.7 percent to $7,197.50 a ton ($3.26 a pound).  Aluminum, lead, tin, nickel and zinc gained in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
