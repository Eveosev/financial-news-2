Germany ’s Tony Martin beat Olympic
champion Bradley Wiggins by almost a minute to win his third
consecutive time-trial title at the road world cycling
championships in Italy.  Martin finished the 58-kilometer (36-mile) ride into
Florence in a time of 1 hour, 5 minutes and 36.65 seconds. It’s
the 28-year-old’s second gold medal of the championships, after
he helped Omega Pharma-Quick Step to the team time-trial title.  Britain’s Wiggins finished runner-up, 46.09 seconds behind
Martin. The 2012 Tour de France champion used a late charge to
overtake four-time champion Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland,
who was third.  Wiggins, 33, pulled out of the Giro d’Italia earlier this
year and missed the Tour de France with a knee injury. He came
back to win the Tour of Britain three days ago.  Vasil Kiryienka of Belarus was fourth and Taylor Phinney
was the top American, finishing more than two minutes back of
Martin in fifth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
