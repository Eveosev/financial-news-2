Investors face losses from fixed-income securities “for the next couple of years,” according to
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest money manager.  “Overall returns of the market will continue to be
negative as monetary policy shifts,” Scott Thiel, deputy chief
investment officer for fundamental fixed income, said at a media
briefing in London today.  U.S. Treasuries, the benchmark for everything from
mortgages to corporate bonds, lost 2.5 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes, amid
concern the  Federal Reserve  is moving closer to ending its
monetary-stimulus program. The Fed last week unexpectedly
refrained from trimming its monthly asset-purchases.  BlackRock still sees opportunities in fixed-income assets,
Thiel said. He is “overweight” Portuguese, Irish and Slovenian
government bonds, meaning the company has increased its holdings
relative to the benchmark it uses to gauge performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
