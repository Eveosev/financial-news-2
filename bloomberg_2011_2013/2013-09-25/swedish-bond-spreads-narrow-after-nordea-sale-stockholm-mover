Swedish bond yields eased the most
relative to German bunds in more than three weeks in  Stockholm 
trading after the government raised 21.6 billion kronor ($3.4
billion) by selling its remaining stake in  Nordea (NDA)  Bank AB.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Swedish 10-year
bonds over similar-maturity German bunds narrowed to 62 basis
points today, the smallest gap since Sept. 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The spread narrowed for a fourth day.  “There are reasons to lower national debt to be better
prepared for future crises,” Financial Markets Minister Peter
Norman told reporters in Stockholm today. “The focus of the
government has therefore been to sell the state’s shares in
Nordea.”  The narrowing of the spread helped erase some of the losses
investors in Swedish bonds have endured in 2013. The country’s
AAA rated debt slumped earlier in the year after a recovery in
the euro area reduced demand for haven assets. Sweden’s economic
revival also drove its yields higher.  The 10-year spread to  Germany  widened earlier this month to
71 basis points, the most since August 1999. Swedish bonds with
a maturity of more than 10 years have slumped 9.4 percent this
year, according to Bloomberg/EFFAS indexes. That’s the worst
performance among the 26 indexes tracked by Bloomberg. In 2011,
Swedish longer maturity bonds surged 31 percent, and they were
little changed last year.  The government sold a 7 percent stake in Stockholm-based
Nordea, the Nordic region’s largest bank, as part of a broader
plan to divest state assets and reduce debt. Some 284 million
shares were sold to domestic and international institutional
investors at 76 kronor per share.  Krona Reverses  While the krona initially strengthened on the share sale as
traders anticipated inflows, it sold off after a report showed
consumer and manufacturing confidence weakened this month.  The  consumer confidence  index fell to 98 from 98.8 in
August, the National Institute of  Economic Research  said. The
index was seen rising to 100.2 in a Bloomberg survey of eight
analysts. A manufacturing confidence index fell to 94.2 from
100.7, missing the estimate of 100.6.  The krona fell the most against the euro since Sept. 5,
losing as much as 0.79 percent to 8.691. Against the  U.S.
dollar , the krona weakened as much as 0.6 percent to 6.4403.  To contact the reporter on this story:
