“Satisfries.” The best part of Burger King Worldwide Inc.’s greasy (but not  too  greasy) creation  may well  be the name. According  to Burger King , Satisfries, which premiered in North America yesterday, have 40 percent less fat and 30 percent fewer calories than McDonald’s fries. That’s due to a coating that  is supposed  to be less porous, resulting in decreased oil absorption. So, a 70-gram serving of Burger King’s newest creation has 150.5 calories versus the 226.8 in the same size portion from McDonald’s. And a small order of the crinkle-cut Satisfries has  70 fewer calories  (270 vs. 340) than Burger King’s regular fries. The technical brilliance behind these fries may be their commercial downfall. When fast-food restaurants add  healthier items  to their menus, not that many people  order them . That’s why, according to  Burger King's North American chief marketing officer , the company opted against adding another healthy option to the menu and instead decided to re-jigger a popular fatty food. The fries are also an effort to snatch back  wayward customers  thinking about bidding goodbye to greasy friends and turning to the dark --  kale-colored  -- side. Burger King isn’t saying these new fries are healthy, just that they’re less unhealthy than the regular kind (and the kind at that place with the golden arches). Satisfries will be offered  right alongside  traditional fries, which more than half of Burger King's customers order. It will be just as easy for consumers to skip the lower-cal fries option as it is for them to pass over a salad for the bulging burger  combo meal . If you really want to eat healthy -- or at least healthier – you probably shouldn’t go to Burger King in the first place. Of course, people don’t eat fast food only because it’s soaked in grease. It’s also cheap .  So Burger King isn’t doing any favors by suggesting that franchisees make Satisfries 20 to 30 cents more expensive than regular fries (although on children's meals, they'll be the same price). The slight premium seems especially unfair given that the  company has said  it will be saving money on oil. Then again, one imagines that two years of work with McCain Foods to engineer the Satisfries came at no small cost. Previous attempts to introduce low-fat fries haven't  turned out so well . But those fries weren't named Satisfries. The ultimate fate of Burger King's latest offering may rest in how utterly awesome -- or  completely humiliating  -- it is to order your burger with a side of Satisfries.
