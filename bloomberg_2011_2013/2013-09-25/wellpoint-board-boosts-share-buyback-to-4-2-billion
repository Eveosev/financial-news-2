WellPoint Inc. (WLP) , the second-biggest
U.S. health insurer, increased its authorization to buy back
shares to about $4.2 billion.  WellPoint raised its share repurchase amount by $3.5
billion and intends to buy the stock “over a multi-year period,
subject to market and industry conditions,” the Indianapolis-based company said today in a regulatory filing. It is the
insurer’s first new buyback  authorization  since a $5 billion
plan announced in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While WellPoint’s shares have fallen 6.1 percent since
Sept. 13 amid reports that large employers are shifting away
from traditional health-insurance plans, the stock has increased
37 percent for the year, as lower-than-projected medical claims
have helped boost profit. WellPoint closed at $83.63 today in
New York.  The company is gearing up to start sales next week on new
insurance markets created by the U.S. Affordable Care Act.
 UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , based in  Minnetonka , Minnesota, is the
biggest health insurer by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
