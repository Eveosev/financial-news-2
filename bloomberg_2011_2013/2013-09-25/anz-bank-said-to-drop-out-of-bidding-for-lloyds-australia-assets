Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  dropped out of bidding for  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s
Australian assets, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  ANZ decided against submitting a final binding offer as it
judged a purchase wouldn’t add significant clients, one of the
people said. The two people asked not to be named as the
transaction is confidential. Final bids are due Sept. 30.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Macquarie Group Ltd. and Pepper
Australia Pty are among other bidders for Lloyds’ A$9 billion
($8.5 billion) in assets, which include a leasing and loan
portfolio, people with knowledge of the matter said Sept. 20.  Britain’s biggest mortgage lender is off-loading operations
it no longer considers essential as it shrinks its balance sheet
after a government bailout in 2008. The U.K. last week started
to sell its 39 percent stake in the London-based lender as part
of a move to full private ownership.  Stephen Ries, a spokesman for Melbourne-based ANZ, declined
to comment on the transaction.  The Wall Street Journal reported the Australian bank’s
withdrawal earlier today. The newspaper said initial offers
valued Lloyds’s commercial-lending and asset-finance units at
more than $A1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
