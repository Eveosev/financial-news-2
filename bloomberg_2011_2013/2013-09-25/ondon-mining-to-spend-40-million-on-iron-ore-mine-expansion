  London Mining Plc (LOND) , the second-largest iron ore producer in  Sierra Leone , said it will boost
spending to raise output to 6 million metric tons a year.  The company, which produced 1.5 million tons of the steel-making ingredient in the first six months of the year, will
spend $40 million in 2014 to expand output, it said in a
statement today. London Mining will spend another $240 million
in 2015 and 2016 to extend the life of its Marampa mine.  “Overall the project economics are better than we (and we
think consensus) expected and this announcement builds on the
positive operational momentum seen over the past year,” Credit
Suisse Group AG said in a note to investors today.  London Mining has focused on developing the Marampa mine
after selling a Brazilian  iron-ore  project to ArcelorMittal for
$810 million in 2008. The company said today that the mine had
reserves to operate for more than 40 years and produce iron ore
at $42 to $45 a ton.  London Mining rose as much as 14 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since Aug. 22, and advanced 8.2 percent to 122
pence by 9:08 a.m. in London.  African Minerals Ltd. (AMI)  is the biggest iron-ore miner in
Sierra Leone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
