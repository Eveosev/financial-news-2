French jobless claims dropped for
the first time in more than two years, providing a boost to
President  Francois Hollande , who’d promised to reverse the trend
before year-end.  The  number of people actively looking for work  fell by
50,000, or 1.5 percent, to 3.24 million in August, the labor
ministry said today in an e-mailed statement.  The first decline since April 2011 reflects Hollande’s
effort to bolster growth and employment by slowing the pace of
 deficit reduction  and sponsoring youth-employment initiatives.
The Socialist president has repeatedly vowed to stop the rise in
unemployment this year.  “We’re very close to turning the unemployment curve,”
Hollande  said on TF1 television  on Sept. 15. “Growth is
beginning to return.”  Hollande’s government today said it expects a budget
deficit of 4.1 percent of gross domestic product this year and
3.6 percent next year.  To be sure, jobless claims remain close to the record 3.29
million set in August and are up 7.3 percent from a year
earlier. Hollande’s approval rating dropped 5 points this month
to a record low of 23 percent, according to an Ifop poll
published earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
