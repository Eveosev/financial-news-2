The ruble weakened for a second day
as investors speculated a rally in the run-up to last week’s
decision by the  Federal Reserve  to maintain stimulus measures
was overdone.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 36.9846
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket by 1:23
p.m. in Moscow. The yield on 10-year ruble bonds rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.26 percent.  The ruble strengthened 4.5 percent in the 10 days through
Sept. 19, its longest rally on record. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  unexpectedly left the central bank’s bond-buying
program in place on Sept. 18, boosting appetite for riskier
assets. An index of 20 emerging-market currencies, compiled by
Bloomberg, retreated for a fourth day today, losing 0.1 percent
to 94.07.  “The ruble recently got such a boost that it has become
attractive to take profits and switch into dollars and euros,”
Vladimir Miklashevsky, trading desk strategist at  Danske Bank
A/S (DANSKE)  in Helsinki, said in e-mailed comments. “Expectations of
the Fed’s tapering have not fully disappeared from the
markets.”  The Federal Reserve will take the first step reducing $85
billion in monthly bond purchases in December, according to 59
percent of 41 economists in a Sept. 18-19 survey, compiled by
Bloomberg.  Russia-dedicated bond funds saw their 17th consecutive week
of outflows in the seven days ended Sept. 18, losing $44
million, OAO Gazprombank said Sept. 20, citing EPFR Global data.
That pared the cumulative inflow into Russian funds since the
beginning of the year to $55 million, Gazprombank said.  Bond Auctions  Russia ’s currency weakened 0.5 percent against the euro to
43.1595 and declined 0.2 percent to 31.9520 against the dollar.  The  Finance Ministry  sold 2.96 billion rubles ($93 million)
of 2019 bonds at an average yield of 6.95 percent out of 16
billion rubles offered, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The ministry will offer 7.6 billion rubles of three-year bonds
at 6.37 percent to 6.42 percent at an auction later today,
according to a website statement.  Oil, Russia’s main export earner, gained 0.8 percent to
$109.52 per barrel in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
