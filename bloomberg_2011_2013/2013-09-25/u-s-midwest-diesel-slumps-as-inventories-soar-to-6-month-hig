Diesel fuel in the U.S. Midwest
slipped relative to futures in New York as area inventories
climbed to a six-month high.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in Group 3, the region from Tulsa,
 Oklahoma , north to  Minnesota  and North Dakota, fell 0.38 cent to
1.75 cents  above futures  at 2:35 p.m., the smallest premium
since Sept. 6. The same fuel in Chicago dropped 1.5 cents to a
0.75 cent premium.  The differentials weakened after a government report showed
area inventories of  distillate fuel  added 632,000 barrels to
 30.9 million  in the week ended Sept. 20, the most since March
15. Refiners in the region processed  3.49 million barrels  of
crude and other feedstock, little changed from the week before,
Energy Information Administration data show.  “We’re just not seeing the demand we’d like to be seeing
this time of year,” said Steve Mosby, vice president of Admo
Energy LLC in Kansas City, Missouri.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Group 3, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, added 65 cents to $11.24
a barrel, the highest level in a week. The  same spread  in
 Chicago  dropped 40 cents to $11.18 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Diesel in Chicago traded 4.18 cents above the same fuel on
the Gulf Coast, a 5.9 percent increase, while Group 3 was at a
premium of 5.71 cents, up 1.8 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the Gulf Coast was
unchanged at 3.63 cents under ULSD futures in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
