Australia  hired former England
batsman Graeme Hick as high-performance coach at its cricket
academy, where he will also be used as a batting mentor.  Hick, 47, fills the role at  Cricket Australia ’s Centre of
Excellence vacated when Stuart Law took over as coach of the
Queensland state team following Darren Lehmann’s appointment as
Australia’s head coach in June.  Hick, who scored six centuries in 65 Tests during a 10-year
England career, will work with Australia’s second-string ‘A’
team, under-19 squad and players in its pathway system, said Pat Howard, Cricket Australia’s general manager of team performance.  “He will also provide a dedicated batting resource to all
state players and Australian players who come through the Centre
of Excellence at any time,” Howard said in a statement.
“Graeme knows what it takes to compete at the top level and has
had many years’ experience playing in different conditions,
which will be vital to the development of our young batters.”  Hick played for Zimbabwe from 1983-1985 before moving to
 England  to pursue a professional cricket career. The right-hander amassed 41,112 first-class runs, including 136 centuries,
at an average of 52.23 before retiring in 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
