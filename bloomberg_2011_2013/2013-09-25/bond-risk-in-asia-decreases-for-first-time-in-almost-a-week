The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 3 basis points to 151 basis
points as of 8:35 a.m. in Hong Kong,  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  prices show. The benchmark last declined on
Sept. 19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 1 basis point to 118
as of 10:22 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia Bank
Ltd. prices. The gauge is set to snap three consecutive days of
increases, according to data from CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 1 basis point to
90.75 basis points as of 9:37 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The measure is also poised for its first
decline since Sept. 19, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
