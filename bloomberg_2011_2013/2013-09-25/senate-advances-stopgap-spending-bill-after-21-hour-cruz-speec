The  U.S. Senate  advanced a stopgap
spending measure after Republican Ted Cruz defied party leaders
by staging an extended speech that lasted more than 21 hours.  By a vote of 100-0, with 60 votes required, the Senate
advanced the House bill passed Sept. 20 for further debate.
Cruz killed time by reading from Dr. Seuss’s “Green Eggs
and Ham” and referencing the reality TV show “Duck Dynasty.”  Before sending the measure back to the House,  Senate
Democrats  plan to strip language from the House measure that
would choke off funding for the 2010 health-care law.  Unless an agreement is reached to expedite Senate
consideration of the measure, a vote on passage could occur as
late as Sept. 29. That would give the House just one full
workday to act before spending authority expires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
