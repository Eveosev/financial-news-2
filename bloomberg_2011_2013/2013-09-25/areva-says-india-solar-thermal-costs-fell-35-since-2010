Areva SA (AREVA)  says the cost of building
a solar-thermal power plant in  India  has fallen by about a third
since 2010 thanks to local manufacturing.  The French company is building a 21-billion-rupee ($336
million), 100-megawatt plant for  Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  awarded in
a December 2010 auction.  “Today, when I look at future projects, there is a 30 to
35 percent” reduction in how much it would cost to build a
similar project, Siddhartha Ghoshal, managing director of
Areva’s local solar unit, told a conference in New Delhi today.
“That’s mainly due to the localization of materials.”  All 10 of India’s proposed solar-thermal plants, comprising
500 megawatts of capacity, missed deadlines to start operating
earlier this year, hobbled by escalating costs and difficulties
importing equipment. Only one has been finished so far,  Godawari
Power (GODPI)  & Ispat Ltd.’s 50-megawatt plant, completed in June after
a lack of local parts drove the project 20 percent over budget.  Solar-thermal plants use mirrors to focus sunlight on
liquids to produce steam for turbines. Areva sourced 60 percent
of the equipment for Reliance’s plant in India, though it had to
import the mirrors, Ghoshal said. If Indian mirrors had been
available, 90 percent of the project’s equipment would have been
local and the savings even greater, he said.  Areva said this week that it expects the Reliance plant to
start operation by the end of December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
