Russia  deployed 1,780 emergency-service workers to clear floods in the Sochi region as the Black
Sea resort prepares to hosts the Winter Olympics.  The  task force  pumped out water from waterlogged homes and
reinforced roads and river banks in low-lying areas, according
to a government statement. The subtropical city will host
Russia’s first winter games  from Feb. 7-23 .  Delegates from the  International Olympic Committee  are
 visiting Sochi this week  to make a final check that preparations
for the games are on track. An IOC official said by phone the
visit hasn’t been affected by the flooding. The rain had
decreased and stopped in some areas overnight, the Russian
government said in a statement.  Russia has spent more than $50 billion to prepare the
region, including constructing roads and train service to
connect the coastal hub to be used for the opening ceremony and
ice skating events and the mountains that will host the skiing
and downhill competitions.  In February, President  Vladimir Putin  dismissed Akhmed
Bilalov as an Olympic committee vice president and head of North
Caucasus Resorts, which is developing the ski areas. Putin
criticized an almost sevenfold increase in costs to 8 billion
rubles ($249 million) and a more than two-year delay on the
project by Bilalov’s Krasnaya Polyana.  Russia has also been criticized because of an anti-gay law
that was passed in July that would ban “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” among minors. Individuals who
violate the law could be fined 5,000 rubles and non-Russian may
be jailed for 15 days and deported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
