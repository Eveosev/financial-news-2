Rubber fell for a third day after
private surveys showed U.S.  consumer confidence  slumped in
September and  China’s economy  slowed this quarter.  The contract for February delivery on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange lost as much as 1.9 percent to 271.2 yen a kilogram
($2,750 a metric ton), the lowest level since Sept. 17, and was
at 273 yen at 12:27 p.m. Futures climbed 1.5 percent this month.  The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index declined
to 79.7, the weakest since May, from 81.8 a month earlier, the
New York-based private research group said yesterday. China’s
economy slowed this quarter as growth in manufacturing and
transportation weakened in contrast with official signs of an
expansion pickup, a survey from New York-based China Beige Book
International said yesterday.  “The market mood isn’t very good after the weak surveys,”
Gu Jiong, an analyst at broker Yutaka Shoji Co., said by phone
from Tokyo. “Investors also adjusted their positions before
long holidays in China.”  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 0.2 percent to 20,590  yuan  ($3,363) a ton.
Chinese markets will be closed during Oct. 1-7 for National Day.  Thai rubber  free-on-board remained unchanged at 82.50 baht
($2.63) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
