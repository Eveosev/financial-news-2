Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
 Topix (TPX)  index retreating for a second day, as property and
machinery stocks led losses among the gauge’s 33 groups.  The Topix fell 0.1 percent to 1,214.11 as of 9:05 a.m. in
 Tokyo . The Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.1 percent to
14,715.23.  The Topix has advanced 9.8 percent in September after
falling for four months and was up 7.1 percent this quarter
through yesterday. The gauge has surged 41 percent for the year,
making Japanese equities the best performers among developed
markets.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent
today. The measure fell 0.3 percent yesterday amid concerns over
budget talks aimed at avoiding a government shutdown next week
and as the Conference Board’s index of  consumer confidence 
slumped in September to a four-month low.  The Topix  traded  at 1.27 times book value yesterday,
compared with 2.50 for the S&P 500 and 1.76 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. The Japanese measure’s 30-day historic  volatility  was
at 19.73 yesterday, compared with its five-year median of 19.42.  To contact the reporter on this story:
