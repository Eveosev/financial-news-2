Peru’s state-owned water utility
Sedapal will invest 456 million soles ($165 million) on water
supply and sanitation projects in the Lima and Callao area.  The project’s plans include 490 kilometers (305 miles) of
pipeline, 17 reservoirs and a sewage plant capable of treating
900 liters (237 gallons) of wastewater a second, Sedapal said on
its website.  The project that will benefit more than 72,000 people in
Lurigancho Chosica and San Antonio de Huarochiri will be
partially financed by the German development bank KfW and the
 Inter-American Development Bank , the utility said in a Sept. 19
statement. Sedapal is officially known as Servicio de Agua
Potable y Alcantarillado de Lima.  To contact the reporter on this story:
