The U.K. government challenged
European Union caps on banker bonuses at the bloc’s highest
court.  The challenge was filed at the EU Court of Justice in
Luxembourg, the U.K. Treasury said in a statement.  The EU brokered a deal in February to outlaw banker bonuses
that are more than twice fixed pay, a move lawmakers said would
prevent excessive payouts and curb irresponsible risk-taking.
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  opposed the
curbs, saying they would harm the competitiveness of the
nation’s finance industry.  About 35,000 employees at banks around the world may be
caught by the European Union caps, more than 20 times the
current number of people affected by the pay rules, the  British
Bankers’ Association  said in a report last month.  Sky News  reported the legal challenge earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
