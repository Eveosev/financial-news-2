The Treasury Department’s $35
billion sale of five-year notes may draw a  yield  of 1.422
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in September 2018, yielded
1.435 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New
York  time. Last month’s sale of the securities yielded 1.624
percent, the most since May 2011. The size of today’s offering
is the same as the past 36 sales of five-year notes after
peaking at $42 billion from November 2009 through April 2010.  The Aug. 28 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.38. The average at the past 10 auctions was 2.7.  Indirect bidders , a class of investor that includes foreign
central banks, bought 40.3 percent of the notes at the August
sale. The average at the past 10 auctions was 44 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.7 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 15.6
percent at the past 10.  Five-year notes have lost 1.9 percent this year, versus a
loss of 2.6 percent by Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year securities returned
2.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the second of three note auctions this
week totaling $97 billion. The government sold $33 billion in
two-year debt yesterday at a yield of 0.348 percent, and will
sell $29 billion in seven-year securities tomorrow.  The sales this week, along with last week’s $13 billion 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities auction, will raise
$47.7 billion of new cash, as maturing securities held by the
public total $62.3 billion, according to the Treasury.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
