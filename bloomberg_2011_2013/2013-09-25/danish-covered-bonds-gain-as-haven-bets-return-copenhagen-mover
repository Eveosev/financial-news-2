Danish mortgage bonds gained and
yields extended declines in Copenhagen trading as investors
sought refuge in  Europe ’s second-largest mortgage-backed covered
bond market following signs of a slowdown in the euro area.  The yield on Nykredit A/S’s 3.5 percent callable bond
maturing 2044 fell to 3.73 percent, its lowest since Aug. 20,
according to SEB Merchant Banking data compiled by Bloomberg. A
similar-maturity Realkredit Danmark bond yielded 3.73 percent,
also its lowest since Aug. 20.  “The haven play is still relevant,” Lise Bergmann, a
housing economist at Nykredit, said by phone. “Disappointing”
data from  Germany  and signals from the  European Central Bank  it
may need to do more to support the euro area are driving down
yields particularly in the long end, Bergmann said.  German business confidence rose less than expected earlier
this week, and ECB President  Mario Draghi  said he will “use any
instrument,” including another long-term refinancing operation,
to curb excessive rises in money market rates.  Until this month, Denmark’s mortgage bonds had been losing
ground. The Nykredit index fell to a year-low of 399.46 on Sept.
5. Since then, the index has risen to 402.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
