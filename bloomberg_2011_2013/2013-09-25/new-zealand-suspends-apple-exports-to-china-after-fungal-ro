New Zealand ’s government said
domestic apple growers suspended exports to China after a fungal
rot discovery, less than two months after the nation’s biggest
exporter was hurt by a contamination scare.  The fungus, while not a threat to  food safety , is
considered in China to be harmful to plants, New Zealand’s
Ministry for Primary Industries said in a statement today.
Chinese authorities traced the three affected consignments of
apples to Hawke’s Bay, the nation’s largest growing region, on
the east of the  North Island , the ministry said.  Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the world’s
biggest dairy exporter, said early last month a dirty pipe may
have contaminated a whey protein used in baby formula,
triggering recalls in China by Coca-Cola Co. and Danone SA.
While testing subsequently found there was no food safety risk,
Fonterra undertook a review of its handling of the scare, which
jeopardized New Zealand’s trade links with China.  “Industry has informed us that in response to the rot
being detected -- and considering this apple export season is
almost over -- it has voluntarily suspended all apple exports to
China for the remainder of the season,” the ministry said in
its statement today.  New Zealand currently exports about NZ$15 million of apples
to China a year, according to a Radio New Zealand  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
