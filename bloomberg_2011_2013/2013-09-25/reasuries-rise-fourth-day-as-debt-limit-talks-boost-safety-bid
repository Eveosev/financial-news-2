Treasury 10-year notes rose,
pushing yields to the lowest level in six weeks, on speculation
U.S. budget talks may lead to a government shutdown.  U.S. government debt  remained higher as the Treasury sold
$35 billion in five-year notes to the most demand in four
months. Benchmark 10-year notes gained earlier after Treasury
Secretary Jacob J. Lew said investor confidence a deal can be
struck to raise the debt limit is “a bit greater than it should
be” and the government will probably have less than $50 billion
in cash by mid-October. The U.S. will sell $29 billion of seven-year debt tomorrow.  “We continue to see a market being driven by what’s going
on in  Washington ,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in
New York of government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co.
“That angst in the marketplace is driving Treasury prices
higher. The auction seemed to be a decent, but not a blowout.”  The benchmark U.S.  10-year yield  dropped three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.63 percent at 5 p.m.  New
York  time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched
2.61 percent, the lowest since Aug. 12. The price of the 2.5
percent security due in August 2023 added 7/32, or $2.19 per
$1,000 face amount, to 98 7/8.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index rose for the first time in 11 days,
increasing 0.6 percent to 75.3, above the 2013 average of 71.86.
It climbed on Sept. 5 to 114.19, a two-month high.  Volume Gains  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, rose 3.8 percent to $320
billion, from $308 billion yesterday. Volume surged to $459.9
billion on Sept. 18, when the Fed unexpectedly maintained the
pace of its bond-buying program known as quantitative easing.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY)  has fallen less than
0.1 percent since the end of June, heading for a fourth
quarterly decline. It gained 0.8 percent in September, leaving
it down 2.5 percent for 2013.  “The market has had a good tone, and nothing’s changed out
of Washington,” said  David Ader , U.S. government bond-strategy
head at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We’re
being held hostage to the debt-ceiling debate, timing and
outcome. We will get through it. There won’t be a default, but
potentially we could see the government shut down.”  The notes sold today drew a  yield  of 1.436 percent,
compared with a forecast of 1.422 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. The
 bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids
with the amount of debt offered, was 2.67, the highest since the
May auction.  The debt sold today will be classified as an additional
issue of the outstanding seven-year notes sold on Sept. 30,
2011, the Treasury said, as the coupon rate was set at 1.375
percent, matching the level for the notes sold two years ago.  Bidder Participation  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 44.9 percent of the notes sold today,
compared with an average of 44 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 11.8 percent of
the notes, compared with an average of 15.6 percent at the past
10 offerings.  Five-year notes have lost 1.9 percent this year. This
week’s three auctions total $97 billion. The U.S. sold $33
billion in two-year debt yesterday at a yield of 0.348 percent.  The sales this week, along with last week’s $13 billion 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities auction, will raise
$47.7 billion of new cash, as maturing securities held by the
public total $62.3 billion, according to the Treasury.  Auction Bidding  Investors bid $2.88 for each dollar of the $1.589 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  The  U.S. Senate  advanced a stopgap spending measure by a
vote of 100-0, with 60 votes required. The bill was initially
passed Sept. 20 by the  House of Representatives  to cover federal
spending through Dec. 15.  Before sending the measure back to the House,  Senate
Democrats  plan to strip language from the House measure that
would choke off funding for the 2010 health-care law.  House
Republicans  are demanding the defunding of President  Barack
Obama ’s health-care law as the price for a temporary measure to
keep the government open.  ‘Statistical Drag’  “It’s one more reason why the Fed won’t be able to do
anything in the short term because they may not have any data,”
said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading
in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “There’s the potential
of that creating a statistical drag through omission.”  The deadline for action is Sept. 30, when the federal
fiscal year ends. Obama has said he won’t accept the condition,
setting up the possibility of a government shutdown if the issue
isn’t resolved on time.  Republicans also are imposing a series of conditions,
including concessions on government spending levels and a revamp
of the  tax code , to raise the nation’s $16.7 trillion debt
limit, which U.S. Treasury officials say they expect to exhaust
as soon as mid-October.  Treasury bills maturing close to the deadline for raising
the borrowing ceiling were little changed. Rates on bills due on
Oct. 24 were 0.015 percent, compared with 0.005 percent two
weeks ago. The rate on bills due Oct. 31 has held within two
basis points of zero during the period.  The Fed buys $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a
month to support the economy by putting downward pressure on
borrowing costs. It purchased $3.16 billion in Treasuries today
maturing between November 2020 and August 2023. It refrained
from tapering the buying after its Sept. 17-18 meeting, saying
it needs more evidence of lasting improvement in the economy.  Twenty-four of 41 economists surveyed by Bloomberg on Sept.
18-19 said the Fed won’t take the first step in slowing its bond
purchases until December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
