Cia. Minera Autlan SAB (AUTLANB) ,  North
America ’s largest manganese producer, is rallying the most in
nine years amid growing speculation that the company is
preparing a move into the more profitable precious-metals
business.  The shares jumped 14.6 percent to 10:50 a.m. in Mexico City
trading, the most since May 16 on a closing basis. That’s
pushing the seven-day rally to the highest level since December
2004 after El Financiero cited Chairman Jose Antonio Rivero Larrea in a Sept. 17 article as saying that the company was
 evaluating  the purchase of projects from Canadian gold and
silver miners. The IRT Small Capitalization  index , of which
Autlan is a part, fell 0.1 percent in the period.  The report has been reviving interest in Autlan, whose
shares fell to a six-year low on Aug. 29, according to Rodrigo Heredia, an analyst at Grupo Financiero Ve Por Mas SA. The rally
accelerated after Heredia’s firm sent an e-mailed research note
Sept. 20 saying the company has the cash to undertake such
projects and the news is “positive.” Manganese is used in
steelmaking.  “This shows they have a better alternative than just being
in the steel sector, which is complicated these days,” Heredia
said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. “It could also
put them in the spotlight.”  An Autlan official said the company had no immediate
comment on the El Financiero story.  To contact the reporter on this story:
