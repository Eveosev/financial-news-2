Publicis Groupe SA’s merger with
 Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC)  would involve cooperation between European
Union and U.S. merger-review authorities,  Joaquin Almunia , the
EU’s competition commissioner, said today.  Almunia said he expects EU-U.S. dialog on merger cases to
continue in “the near future” on the transaction between New
York-based Omnicom and Paris-based Publicis, “a deal that would
create the world’s biggest advertising group.” The transaction
hasn’t been notified yet to the EU authorities.  Chief executives of both companies said in July that they
didn’t expect to face regulatory hurdles. If approved, the union
of Publicis and Omnicom will overtake market leader  WPP Plc (WPP) ,
creating an advertising powerhouse with $35 billion in market
value and about 41 percent of total spending by the top 10 media
agencies in the world, according to data compiled by Advertising
Age.  To contact the reporter on this story:
