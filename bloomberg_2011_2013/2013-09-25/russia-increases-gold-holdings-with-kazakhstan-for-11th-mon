Russia and  Kazakhstan  expanded
their  gold reserves  for an 11th straight month in August as
bullion prices rallied. Mexico reduced its holdings.  Russian assets gained 12.7 metric tons to 1,015.5 tons,
International Monetary Fund data showed today. Kazakhstan’s
reserves rose 2.5 tons to 134.5 tons and  Turkey  added 23.4 tons
to 487.4 tons, the data showed.  Gold advanced 5.3 percent in August, the second straight
monthly gain and longest rally since September last year, as
lower prices boosted demand amid mounting concern about military
action against  Syria . Investors  sold  16.8 tons from gold-backed
exchange-traded products in August, the smallest outflow this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Central banks are “long-term holders of gold, with a long-term view and prices at the moment are pretty attractive for a
long-term buyer,” said Victor Thianpiriya, an analyst at
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in  Singapore . “The
fact that they’re doing it in smaller volumes is consistent with
the fact that sentiment towards gold is getting a bit more
negative.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,326.79
an ounce at 2:48 p.m. in Singapore. Prices are set to gain 7.5
percent this quarter, the first advance in a year.  Annual Drop  The metal is heading for the first annual drop in 13 years
as signs of a U.S. recovery and speculation the  Federal Reserve 
may curb stimulus hurt gold demand while stocks and the dollar
climb. Gold’s 21 percent slump compares with a 2.9 percent
advance in the  dollar  and 13 percent gain in equities.  Bullion rose 70 percent from December 2008 to June 2011 as
the U.S. Federal Reserve pumped more than $2 trillion into the
financial system by purchasing debt, increasing investors’
concern about currency debasement and accelerating inflation.
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said there is no fixed schedule for
tapering after the central bank unexpectedly maintained $85
billion a month in asset purchases this month.  While that decision may help gold prices in the short-term,
bullion may drop below $1,250 before the end of the year,
Citigroup Inc. said this week. Central bank purchases may total
370 tons in 2013, 30 percent less than a year earlier, it said.
Nations added 534.6 tons to reserves last year, the most since
1964, according to the World Gold Council.  Azerbaijan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Ukraine also added to
reserves in August, the IMF data show. Mexico reduced its
holdings for a 16th month to 123.6 tons and the  Czech Republic 
also sold, according to the data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
