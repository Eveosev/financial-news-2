SoftBank Corp. (9984)  sold the most  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones in Japan during the first three days of sales for
the new 5s and 5c models, beating NTT DoCoMo Inc. and  KDDI Corp. (9433)   SoftBank accounted for 44.7 percent of Japanese sales of
the two models which were released Sept. 20, while DoCoMo took a
27.8 percent market share and KDDI controlled 27.5 percent,
according to estimates from researcher BCN Inc. Sales of the
iPhone 5s with fingerprint-sensor were about five-fold of the
cheaper 5c model, BCN, which compiles data from retail outlets,
said yesterday on its website.  Competition among Japan’s three major carriers is building
as DoCoMo, the nation’s largest mobile carrier, began carrying
the  iPhone  this month in an attempt to reverse market-share
losses. DoCoMo’s share of mobile users slumped to 46 percent in
August, compared with 52 percent in 2008, as first SoftBank and
then KDDI won Japanese users with the Apple handset.  SoftBank’s boosted iPhone sales through catchy
advertisements and marketing campaigns, BCN  said  in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
