Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
will add 700 employees this year in Colombia as it opens 47 new
offices, said Oscar Cabrera, the bank’s local unit president.  The hires will increase staff at BBVA Colombia, the
country’s fourth-largest lender, to 5,500 by the end of the
year, Cabrera told reporters in Bogota. The bank plans to spend
$445 million to expand in Colombia and add 2,000 workers through
2016, he said.  “It has the objective of significantly improving our
market share and presence in Colombia,” Cabrera said. “Our
operations here have powerful profit generation and capital
generation, and we’re going to be able to eat our cake without
having to ask for additional capital from our parent.”  BBVA Colombia, the Andean nation’s largest international
bank, with about 10 percent of loans, is looking to add 3
percentage points to its market share, Cabrera said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
