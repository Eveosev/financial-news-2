Aston Villa striker Christian
Benteke may miss as long as six weeks of the soccer season after
injuring his hip.  The 22-year-old Belgian won’t need an operation for the
muscle injury, manager  Paul Lambert  said yesterday. He’s likely
to miss some of his country’s qualifying matches for the 2014
 World Cup  in Brazil.  “It’s not as bad as we feared,” Lambert said in comments
on Villa’s website. “It’s maybe four, five, six weeks or so.”  He scored 19 goals for Villa last season after joining from
Genk.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
