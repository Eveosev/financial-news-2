San Francisco  gasoline weakened to
the lowest level since in almost four weeks after  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  reported that its Martinez refinery was operating
normally after maintenance.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in San Francisco
weakened by 1.5 cents to a premium of 4 cents a gallon over
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the smallest premium since Aug. 29.  The 165,000-barrel-a-day Shell refinery in Northern
California started maintenance on Sept. 11 to “optimize
operations,” Houston-based spokeswoman Destin Singleton said at
the time. The refinery is now operating normally, Singleton said
today.  Carbob in Los Angeles strengthened by 1.25 cents to a
premium of 13.25 cents a gallon. Conventional, 84-octane
gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon , weakened by 2 cents to a premium
of 8 cents a gallon.  California-blend diesel in San Francisco weakened by 0.25
cent to a discount of 2.5 cents a gallon to ultra-low-sulfur
diesel futures on the Nymex. The fuel in  Los Angeles  weakened by
0.5 cent to a premium of 0.25 cent.  Low-sulfur diesel  in
Portland weakened by 2.25 cents to a discount of 4.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
