The U.S. House plans to vote next
week on a measure that would undo a Dodd-Frank Act requirement
that banks move their derivatives business out to affiliates.  The bill, included on a schedule released by Republican
House leaders, would alter the 2010 law’s pushout provision by
allowing trading of almost all types of derivatives by units of
banks with access to deposit insurance and discount borrowing.
The provision was put in Dodd-Frank as a way to reduce risk by
banks such as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Citigroup Inc. that
benefit from U.S. backstops.  The revision, which has broad support in the House, hasn’t
gained traction in the Senate. A companion bill introduced by
Senator  Kay Hagan , a North Carolina Democrat, hasn’t seen
movement.  The House Financial Services Committee approved a bill
sponsored by Representative Randy Hultgren, an Illinois
Republican and Representative James Himes, a Connecticut
Democrat, by a 53-6 vote in May after the House Agriculture
Committee advanced it by a 31-14 vote in March.  The  Federal Reserve  has granted certain banks two-year
extensions to comply with the Dodd-Frank requirement to separate
derivative trading from U.S. units that get federal backing. The
central bank has said in letters to banks that the companies
must determine whether to halt the swaps activity or move it to
properly capitalized affiliates.  The House bill is H.R. 992.  To contact the reporters on this story:
