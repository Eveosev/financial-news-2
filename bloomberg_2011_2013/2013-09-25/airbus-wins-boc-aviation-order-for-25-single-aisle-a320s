Airbus SAS (EAD)  won an order for 25
A320s from BOC Aviation Ltd. as the lessor expands its portfolio
amid a surge in travel across the Asia-Pacific region.  BOC Aviation, a unit of  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) , will make an
announcement on the engines later, the Singapore-based lessor
said in an e-mail statement today. The order comprises A320 and
A321 variants and deliveries are from 2015 to 2019, according to
the statement.  Airbus yesterday predicted airlines globally will buy
planes valued at $4.4 trillion in the next two decades, driven
by demand in India and China and global growth among low-fare
carriers. Economic growth in Malaysia, Indonesia and other
Southeast Asian nations is boosting travel across the region,
prompting  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) ,  AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA)  and PT Lion
Mentari Airlines to place orders.  Including this purchase agreement, BOC Aviation’s
cumulative orders for new Airbus aircraft reached a total of
212, of which 125 have already been delivered with 41 airlines
and another 11 committed to lease, the lessor said.  BOC Aviation has a portfolio of 229 owned and managed
aircraft operated by airlines worldwide and another 108 planes
on firm order, according to the statement. The company’s fleet
has an average age of less than four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
