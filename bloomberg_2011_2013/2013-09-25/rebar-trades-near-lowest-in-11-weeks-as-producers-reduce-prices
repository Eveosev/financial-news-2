Steel reinforcement-bar futures
traded near the lowest level in 11 weeks after some Chinese
steel producers cut prices, increasing concern that inventories
are rising as supply outpaces demand.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.3 percent to 3,617  yuan  ($591) a
metric ton and traded at 3,619 yuan at 10:45 a.m. The most-active contract declined to 3,612 yuan on Sept. 23, the lowest
since July 10. Futures have lost 3.6 percent this month.  Anyang Iron & Steel Group Co. cut its rebar price by 100
yuan a ton yesterday, according to Steelcn.com. Jiangsu Shagang
Co., the biggest producer, cut its price by 80 yuan this week,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co.
Inventory rose 1.9 percent to 6.08 million tons last week from a
week earlier, according to a report by Beijing Cifco Futures Co.  “Major steelmakers cutting ex-factory prices and rising
inventory are adding pressure to prices,” Dang Man, an analyst
at Maike Futures Co., said from Xi’an.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose 0.2
percent to $132.70 yesterday, according to a  price index 
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The average spot price of rebar
fell 0.1 percent to 3,512 yuan on the same day, according to
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
