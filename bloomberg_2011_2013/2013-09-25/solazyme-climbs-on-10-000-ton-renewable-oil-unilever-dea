Solazyme Inc. (SZYM) , a U.S. producer of
renewable oil from algae, climbed the most in more than six
weeks after signing a supply deal with  Unilever NV. (UNA)   The company gained 7.4 percent to $11.51 at the close in
 New York , the most since Aug. 8.  Solazyme will deliver at least 10,000 metric tons of
specialty oils to the Dutch producer of household products, the
South San Francisco-based company said today in a statement.
Delivery will start early next year and will be complete within
18 months. Terms weren’t disclosed.  “This is about being able to demonstrate that we can be a
reliable, large-scale supplier,” Chief Executive Officer
Jonathan Wolfson said in a telephone interview.  This is the company’s first supply deal with Unilever, the
largest supplier of household products by market value after
Procter & Gamble Co.  Solazyme will produce the oil at a Moema, Brazil, plant
that’s a joint venture with the agricultural company  Bunge Ltd. (BG) 
The facility also may serve additional customers after it begins
commercial production later this year, Wolfson said.  Solazyme makes oils from sugar-consuming algae that are
processed into renewable fuel and specialty chemicals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
