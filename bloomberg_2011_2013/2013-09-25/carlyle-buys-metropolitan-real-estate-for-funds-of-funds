Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s
second-biggest manager of alternative assets such as private
equity and property, agreed to buy Metropolitan Real Estate
Equity Management LLC to expand its fund-of-funds business.  Carlyle, which will finance the purchase from its balance
sheet, didn’t disclose a price, according to a statement today
from the Washington-based private-equity manager. The deal is
scheduled to be completed in November, subject to the consent of
Metropolitan’s investors.  Metropolitan will become part of Carlyle’s solutions
business, which also includes AlpInvest, the $48 billion
private-equity fund-of-funds operation. Started in 2002 and
based in  New York , Metropolitan has raised more than $2.6
billion across 16 funds of funds with investments in more than
80 managers. The firm has 40 employees with five offices in the
U.S.,  Europe  and Asia.  Metropolitan’s management team, led by David Sherman, will
stay and Sherman will become head of real estate within the
solutions business, in addition to his role of co-chief
investment officer of Metropolitan, Carlyle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
