Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY) , the U.K.’s
largest construction group, won a 125 million-pound ($200
million) contract to develop student housing on the main campus
of the  Texas  A&M University System.  The development in College Station, Texas, will incorporate
about 4,000 beds in apartments and residence halls and will
house dining services and other amenities, the London-based
company said in a statement today. Details of the contract will
be finalized in the coming months.  “We have identified student accommodation as a key growth
area for us and we are excited about the opportunities in this
growing market, both in the U.K. and U.S.,” Chief Executive
Officer Andrew McNaughton said in the statement.  The company, which has about 50,000 employees and generates
half of its revenue in the U.K., is seeing an increase in
orders, particularly in the U.S., as construction picks up amid
an improving economy. Today’s contract is the company’s sixth
student-accommodation project in the U.S. and 10th globally.  The shares rose 0.1 percent to 284.30 pence at 10:15 a.m.
in  London , giving the company a market value of 1.96 billion
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
