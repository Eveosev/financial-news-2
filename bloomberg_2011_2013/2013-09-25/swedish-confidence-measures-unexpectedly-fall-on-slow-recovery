Sweden ’s  confidence  measures
unexpectedly fell this month as the largest Nordic economy
struggles to gain moment amid slack demand from abroad.  The  consumer confidence  index fell to 98 from 98.8 the
prior month, the Stockholm-based National  Institute of  Economic
Research  said today. The index was seen rising to 100.2 in a
Bloomberg  survey  of eight analysts. A  manufacturing confidence 
index fell to 94.2 from 100.7, missing the estimate of 100.6.  “The decrease was due to a more pessimistic view of
personal finances, with the Micro Index falling more than 3
points,” the NIER said. “Consumers are more upbeat about the
Swedish economy, however, with the Macro Index gaining almost 2
points.”  Sweden’s central bank this month said it will keep  interest
rates  unchanged at 1 percent for another year to support a
recovery as demand from abroad picks up. The Nordic country’s
four-party coalition government last week said it will cut
income taxes for a fifth time since coming to power in 2006.  Sweden’s $540 billion  economy  contracted 0.2 percent last
quarter, according to figures from  Statistics Sweden  published
this month.  Unemployment (SWUERATE)  will rise to 8.2 percent this year from
8 percent in 2012 and decline to 8.1 percent next year, the
government predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
