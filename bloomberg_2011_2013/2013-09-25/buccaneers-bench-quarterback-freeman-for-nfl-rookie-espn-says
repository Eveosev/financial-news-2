Josh Freeman has been benched as
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ starting quarterback in favor of
rookie Mike Glennon, ESPN reported, citing people familiar with
the situation that it didn’t identify.  Freeman, 25, had been the Buccaneers’ starter since his
rookie year, when he was selected in the first round of the 2009
draft from Kansas State. He’s completed a National Football
League-low 45.7 percent of his passes during the team’s 0-3
start.  Second-year head coach Greg Schiano had said in his news
conferences this week that Freeman would remain the team’s
starter. The Buccaneers, who have the second-fewest passing
yards and points-scored among the NFL’s 32 teams, said Schiano
would address the issue after today’s practice. Tampa Bay hosts
the  Arizona  Cardinals this week.  Freeman helped the Buccaneers to a 10-6 record in his
second NFL season, completing about 61 percent of his passes
with 25 touchdowns and six interceptions. He threw 22
interceptions the following season as Tampa Bay went 4-12, and
last year his completion percentage dropped to 54.8 with 17
interceptions as the Buccaneers had a 7-9 record.  Glennon was taken in the third round of the draft out of
North Carolina State.  To contact the reporter on this story:
