U.K.  consumer confidence  rose in
September as the recovery strengthened and households became
less concerned about job security, the Centre for Economics and
Business Research said.  The group’s gauge of sentiment increased to 108.1 from
106.7 in August, it and  YouGov Plc (YOU)  said in a report in London
today. Its measure of job security was at 91.1, up from 87.3 
at the start of the year.  The CEBR said the improvement in the index indicates the
economy is now in a sustained recovery. The statistics office
will publish its third estimate of  second-quarter gross domestic
product  later today, which is forecast to confirm a 0.7 percent
expansion. The report will also include data on consumers’
disposable income and the savings ratio.  “The present recovery is now broader based than the false
dawn we saw in 2010,” said CEBR Chairman Douglas McWilliams.
“Given this continued momentum, we would expect growth next
year to be its strongest since 2007 -- before the financial
crisis crippled the real economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
