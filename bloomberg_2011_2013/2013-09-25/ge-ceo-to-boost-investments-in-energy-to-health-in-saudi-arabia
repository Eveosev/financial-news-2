General Electric Co. (GE)  plans to add
more local manufacturing facilities, training and research
centers in  Saudi Arabia  as part of its $1 billion commitment to
the country, Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  said.  The new plants and centers will support the oil and gas,
power, and health sectors -- areas where GE expects to see its
business expand, Immelt said today by phone from Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., GE and  Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) 
yesterday introduced the first all-female business process
services center in Riyadh. The center, which will initially
serve Saudi Aramco and GE as clients, will be staffed by Saudi
females with Tata and GE owning 76 percent and 24 percent of the
venture, GE said in a statement.  The business-service center is part of a GE global strategy
under which it opened six centers worldwide, Immelt said.  GE announced yesterday the opening of a training facility,
in the Kingdom’s petrochemical hub city of Jubail. The GE
Technical Academy demonstrates the company’s commitment to the
government’s plans to create more jobs for its youth, especially
in technology-related and energy sectors, Immelt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
