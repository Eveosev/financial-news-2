Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd. (OUE) ,
which is buying California’s tallest building, is considering
setting up a commercial real estate investment trust to be
listed on the main board of  Singapore Exchange , the company said.  The proposed REIT may include OUE Bayfront in  Singapore  and
commercial properties owned by  Lippo China Resources Ltd. (156) , the
company said in a filing to the exchange.  OUE Hospitality Trust (OUEHT) , which owns a downtown hotel and
shopping mall in Singapore, was listed in July, raising S$600
million in the initial public offering.  OUE is controlled by Executive Chairman Stephen Riady, a
son of Mochtar Riady, who controls Indonesia’s Lippo Group.
Lippo’s businesses include real estate, financial services and
food across  Asia . The company said earlier this year it’s buying
the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles, the tallest in the West
Coast state, for $367.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
