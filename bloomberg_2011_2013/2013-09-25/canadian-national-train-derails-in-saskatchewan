(Corrects full company name in first paragraph.)  A  Canadian National Railway Co. (CNR) 
train derailed in Saskatchewan and one of the cars leaked oil,
police said.  Sixteen cars derailed in the incident that occurred west of
the town of Landis, the  Royal Canadian Mounted Police  said in an
e-mailed statement. The size of the leak is unknown at this
time, police said.  Mark Hallman, a spokesman for CN Rail, didnâ€™t immediately
respond to e-mail and voice mail messages seeking comment on the
derailment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
