West Texas Intermediate rebounded
from four days of losses before U.S. data that’s forecast to
show stockpiles dropped in the world’s largest oil consumer.  Futures rose as much as 0.7 percent before the government
report today that may show crude inventories slid 1 million
barrels to an 18-month low last week. WTI dropped to the lowest
close in eight weeks yesterday on speculation that U.S.-Iranian
relations are thawing. Citigroup Inc. still raised its 2014
Brent forecast today, citing an increase in geopolitical risk,
according to an e-mailed report today.  “U.S. inventory figures will be one of the highlights
today, especially as we’re moving out of driving season,” said
Thina Saltvedt, an analyst at Nordea Bank AG in Oslo. “Things
are calming down in  Libya  with production coming back.  Iran  is
back to negotiating, but there are still some doubts there.”  WTI crude for November delivery advanced as much as 73
cents to $103.86 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $103.71 as of 1:03 p.m. in London. Futures slid 2.7
percent over the previous four sessions. The volume of all
futures traded was 17 percent below the 100-day average. Prices
are up 7.1 percent this quarter and 12 percent in 2013.  Supply Forecast  Brent for November settlement gained 98 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $109.73 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark traded at a premium of
$5.98 to WTI, compared with $5.93 yesterday, the widest since
Sept. 6.  U.S. crude inventories fell 0.3 percent to 354.6 million
barrels as of Sept. 20, according to the median of 10 analyst
estimates surveyed before the Energy Information Administration
report. Supplies probably dropped as refineries operated at more
than 90 percent of capacity and oil imports slipped.  The EIA, the U.S. Energy Department’s statistical arm, is
scheduled to release its inventory report at 10:30 a.m. today in
 Washington . The data will show stockpiles of gasoline slid
750,000 barrels and middle distillates, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, lost 925,000 barrels last week,
according to the Bloomberg survey.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  said
yesterday crude supplies fell 54,000 barrels. Distillate
inventories rose 485,000 barrels, while gasoline stockpiles
increased 341,000 barrels, it said. The API collects information
on a voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk
terminals and pipelines. The government requires that reports be
filed with the EIA for its weekly survey.  Refinery Runs  Supplies slipped in 10 of the past 12 EIA reports as
refineries  operated  near the highest rates of the year. Plants
have slowed fuel output in the third quarter of each year since
1999 as they implemented maintenance programs. Crude imports
decreased during September in four of the past five years.  Refineries probably ran at 91.6 percent of capacity on
Sept. 20, down 0.9 percentage point from a week earlier, the
survey showed. Units are often idled in September and October
for maintenance as attention shifts away from gasoline and
before heating-oil demand peaks.  Oil rose to a two-year high on Aug. 28 amid concern that a
U.S.-led assault would widen the Syrian conflict and disrupt
Middle East shipments. The  United Nations Security Council  is
set to negotiate a Syria resolution.  U.S. President  Barack Obama   yesterday welcomed overtures
from Iran as a chance to resolve diplomatically the
confrontation over the Persian Gulf nation’s nuclear program,
even as Iranian officials told the U.S. that the time isn’t
right for direct contact between the two countries’ leaders.  There has been a “big jump on the bullish geopolitics
side,” Seth Kleinman, an analyst at Citigroup in  New York , said
in the report. The bank raised its 2014 Brent forecast to $108 a
barrel from $99.  Deutsche Bank AG also increased its forecasts for WTI and
Brent this year after prices rose in the third quarter. The bank
raised its outlook for WTI by 5 percent to $99.88 barrel and
Brent by 1.8 percent to $109, according to a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
