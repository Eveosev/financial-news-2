Russian stocks fell for a fourth
day as the  World Bank  and the International Monetary Fund cut
their growth forecasts for the world’s biggest energy exporter.  The Micex slid 0.2 percent to 1,462.13 by 1:19 p.m. in
Moscow. Polymetal International Plc, a Russian gold and silver
miner, tumbled 2.4 percent to 338.33 rubles. OAO Pharmstandard,
the country’s biggest drugmaker, declined 1.1 percent to
1,633.10 rubles. OAO Moscow Exchange traded down 2.9 percent to
61.36 rubles.  The World Bank cut its forecast for  Russia ’s economic
growth to 1.8 percent from 2.3 percent in 2013 and reduced it to
3.1 percent from 3.6 percent next year, according to a report
today. Russia should avoid higher budget spending in the coming
years and refrain from easing monetary policy to keep inflation
under control, the  International Monetary Fund  said in a report
yesterday, reducing its prediction for the pace of expansion in
2013 to 1.5 percent from 2.5 percent.  “Russia is trying to stick its finger into one hole and
the others start leaking,” Alexei Yazikov, head of research at
Aton Capital LLC, said by phone from Moscow. “It’s impossible
to diversify Russia’s economy quickly, it would take years.
Cutting rates is useless, it’s like offering help to a dead
man.”  Russia should focus on supporting startup companies instead
of small and medium-sized businesses to diversify the economy,
the World Bank said. The comments feed into a government debate
over how to steer the $2 trillion economy out of its sharpest
slowdown since 2009, with the central bank spurning calls by
senior officials for lower borrowing costs by holding its main
lending rates for a year.  Economic Woes  The  Micex (INDEXCF)  sank 0.7 percent on Sept. 13 as Russia’s central
bank kept the  refinancing rate  unchanged at 8.25 percent,
matching the forecast of 14 out of 22 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The nation’s economy expanded 1.2 percent in the second
quarter, the Federal Statistics Service reported on Aug. 9,
missing the median estimate for 2 percent growth.  Gross domestic product will rise 1.8 percent this year, the
 Economy Ministry  said last month, trimming its April forecast
for a 2.4 percent advance.  Crude added 0.3 percent to $103.44 in  New York , the first
gain in five days. Russia receives about half of its budget
revenue from the oil and natural-gas industries.  Average trading volume on the Micex was about 46 percent
below the 30-day average today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Ten-day price swings fell to 16.172. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index dropped 0.3 percent to 1,442.81.  The country’s stocks jumped last week after the U.S.
Federal Reserve unexpectedly decided against reducing monetary
stimulus.  Even after last week’s 2.5 percent rally, Russian equities
have the cheapest  valuations  among 21 emerging economies tracked
by Bloomberg. The Micex Index’s 12-month estimated price-to-earnings ratio was at 4.3 today, compared with a multiple of
10.6 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
