Wheat yields in  England  probably
jumped 16 percent from last year, when crops were hurt by excess
rain, according to a National Farmers’ Union survey.  This year’s harvest averaged 7.8 metric tons a hectare
(2.47 acres), up from 6.7 tons last season and above the five-year average of 7.7 tons, the Stoneleigh Park, England-based
group said today in an e-mailed statement. Production still will
be “much lower” than last year’s 13 million tons because
excess rains that cut yields last summer persisted into
September and October, preventing farmers from planting some
winter crops.  “Many arable farmers are still working under the shadow of
2012’s appalling weather and the knock-on impact,” Andrew
Watts, NFU combinable crops board chairman, said in the
statement. “We have seen some very good yields coming from what
wheat was left after the winter.”  Wheat covered 1.51 million hectares in England, 19 percent
less than 1.86 million hectares a year earlier and 17 percent
below the five-year average, according to the report. The
Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs is set to
release figures for the U.K. on Oct. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
