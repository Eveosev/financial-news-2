ICAP Plc (IAP)  Chief Executive Officer
 Michael Spencer  said the behavior of three former brokers
charged by U.S. prosecutors for manipulating Libor is
“profoundly regrettable.”  “I share with you your horror and disgust,” Spencer, 58,
said on a call with journalists today. “I regret this whole
episode very deeply and very profoundly. A small number of
people have let us down very, very badly.”  ICAP was today fined $88 million by U.S. and U.K.
regulators for its role in the rigging of the yen London
interbank offered rate. The three brokers were charged with two
counts of  wire fraud  and one count of conspiracy to commit wire
fraud for allegedly colluding with traders at  UBS AG (UBSN)  to
manipulate the benchmark  interest rate .  Of the 10 employees identified by regulators as involved in
the wrongdoing, the “three people at the center of this were
dismissed a while ago, others have gone as well and a tiny
number” are still with company after being disciplined, Spencer
said. The company is now spending about 17 million pounds ($27
million) a year on compliance, he added.  London-based ICAP, the world’s largest broker of
transactions between banks, was fined $65 million by the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and 14 million pounds by
the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.  “I don’t think we’ll lose clients,” Spencer said. “At
the end of the day, rogue conduct is something that any company
is vulnerable to.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
