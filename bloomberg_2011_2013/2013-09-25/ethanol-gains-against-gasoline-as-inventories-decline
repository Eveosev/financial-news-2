Ethanol advanced, narrowing its
discount to gasoline, after a government report showed
inventories near the lowest level this year.  The spread tightened 5.63 cents to 77.49 cents a gallon
after the Energy Information Administration said ethanol
 inventories  fell 3.5 percent to 15.6 million barrels last week,
the smallest since June 28, when they were at a record low.  “Stocks are down near the lows of this year and
production’s down,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler
Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “We’re working through
a tight market.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery added 7 cents, or
3.8 percent, to $1.898 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have declined 13 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery gained 1.37 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.6729 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  fell 0.7 percent to 832,000 barrels a
day last week, a three-week low, data from the Energy
Department’s statistical arm show.  Imports jumped to 48,000 barrels a day from 3,000 the
previous week. That’s the most since Aug. 2.  Babler said most ethanol plants are relying on corn from
last year’s harvest until the new supplies arrive. One bushel of
the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel.  Corn Gains  Corn for December delivery rose 6 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$4.5475 a bushel in  Chicago . The December crush spread of corn
to ethanol was minus 2 cents, versus minus 3 cents yesterday.
All crush spreads through July 2016 were negative.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago jumped 9.5 cents
to $2.47 a gallon; in New York prices increased 7.5 cents to
$2.275; in the U.S. Gulf it held at $2.325; and on the West
Coast the biofuel slipped 1.5 cents to $2.26, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Chicago’s premium to New York grew 2 cents to 19.5 cents
while the West Coast’s discount to the Gulf deepened 1.5 cents
to 6.5 cents.  Ethanol  blender inputs , a measure of demand, last week
jumped 1.2 percent to the highest in three weeks, today’s EIA
report showed.  Refiner compliance with federal mandates to use the biofuel
are tracked by Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
attached to each batch of ethanol. The certificates can be kept
by refiners or traded.  Corn-based-ethanol RINS rose 1 cent to 51 cents. Advanced
RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, increased 1 cent to 59 cents.  Prices for the credits have surged this year. Senator
Charles Grassley, a Republican from  Iowa , the largest U.S.
ethanol producer, sent a letter to the Environmental Protection
Agency today asking for more transparency in RINs trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
