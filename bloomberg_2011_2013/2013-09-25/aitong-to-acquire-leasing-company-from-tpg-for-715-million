Haitong Securities Co. (6837) , China’s
second-largest brokerage by market value, said it plans to buy
Shanghai-based leasing company UT Capital Group Co. from U.S.
private-equity firm TPG for $715 million.  Haitong will buy 100 percent of UT Capital, the Shanghai-based brokerage said in a filing to the city’s stock exchange
yesterday. Haitong will pay cash for UT Capital, which TPG
bought in 2008, TPG said in a separate e-mailed statement.  UT Capital’s main operating unit is UniTrust Finance &
Leasing Corp., which provides financial leasing services to more
than 3,000 customers in China in industries including health
care, education, printing, textiles,  machine tools , electronics
and injection molding, TPG said.  In April, TPG was seeking $800 million for UniTrust,
Reuters reported at the time, citing unidentified people with
knowledge of the matter. Morgan Stanley and UBS AG were handling
the deal, the  news agency  said.  UT Capital’s total assets increased to 10.5 billion  yuan 
($1.72 billion) in 2012 from 4.4 billion yuan in 2010, TPG said
in its statement yesterday. The company’s net income was 199
million yuan in the first half of 2013, TPG said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
