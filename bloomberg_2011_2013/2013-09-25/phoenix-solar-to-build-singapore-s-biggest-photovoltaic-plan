Phoenix Solar AG (PS4)  won a contract to
build  Singapore ’s biggest solar photovoltaic plant as demand for
larger units grows in the city state.  The company’s Singapore unit will design and build a 1.2-megawatt plant for CMM Marketing Management Pte., a unit of
 Sheng Siong Group Ltd (SSG) , the Sulzemoos, Germany-based company said
today in a statement. The plant, to be built on the roof of
CMM’s head office, is expected to start up by the year-end.  Demand for bigger solar plants is growing in Singapore due
to falling costs for photovoltaic modules, Phoenix Solar said.  “Thanks to the attractive returns on investment, we expect
the installed PV capacity of Singapore to more than double in
2013, reaching at least 20 megawatts by December,” Managing
Director Christophe Inglin said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
