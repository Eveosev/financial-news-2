Argentina  lost a bid to throw out a
suit in which holders of the nation’s defaulted bonds are
seeking a court order to help them seize assets held by the
country’s central bank.  U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa today denied Argentina’s
request that he dismiss a suit by NML Capital Ltd. and EM Ltd.
asking for a declaration that the Banco Central de la Republica
Argentina is an “alter ego” of the country, and therefore
liable to pay them almost $2.6 billion.  “I think there is a very legitimate claim by the
plaintiffs here that, for certain purposes, BCRA is the alter
ego of the Republic,” Griesa said at a hearing today in
 Manhattan  federal court.  Argentina in 2001 defaulted on a record $95 billion of
foreign debt. Holders of about 91 percent of the bonds agreed to
take new exchange bonds in 2005 and 2010, at a deep discount.
Some holdout investors have won court judgments against
Argentina from the  New York  court and are trying to find assets
they can seize to enforce them.  The case is EM Ltd. v. Banco Central de la Republica
Argentina, 06-cv-07792, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
