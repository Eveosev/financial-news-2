Gulf Finance House (GFH) , the Manama,
Bahrain-based investment bank, said it isn’t able to explain a
10-fold jump in trading activity and surge in its share price.  Gulf Finance surged as much as 12 percent today while Abu
Dhabi-based  Waha Capital PJSC (WAHA)  gained as much as 10 percent. Waha
said earlier this week that it wasn’t aware of any information
that could explain the rise in its stock after it also gained 27
percent on Sept. 23.  “No additional major event has taken place other than
GFH’s improved credit rating to BBB and the effects of market
rebounding due to an improvement in regional political
situation,” Gulf Finance House said today in a statement posted
on the website of the Dubai stock market.  Gulf Finance gained 3 percent to 55.7 fils in Dubai, the
highest since June 20. Volumes were about 10 times the three-month daily average at 639 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
