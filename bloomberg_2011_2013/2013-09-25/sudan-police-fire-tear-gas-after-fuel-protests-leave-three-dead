Sudanese police fired tear gas to
disperse hundreds of protesters in the capital Khartoum today
after two days of demonstrations sparked by the lifting of fuel
subsidies left at least three people dead.  Ahmed Al-Gazouli, a 17-year-old student, died after being
shot in the chest at a rally yesterday in the city of Omdurman,
near Khartoum, his cousin Hamad Al-Tayeb said by phone from the
capital. His funeral will be held today. State media reported
the deaths of two more people in Wad Madani, the capital of
Gezira state in the southeast, and said many have been arrested.  Sudan ’s cabinet on Sept. 23 approved measures including
increases to fuel and transportation prices, and a depreciation
of the Sudanese pound. That lifted the price of gasoline to 14
pounds ($3.17) per gallon from 8 pounds, while public transport
costs jumped 26 percent.  President Umar al-Bashir said on Sept. 23 that state
subsidies for fuel had reached a dangerous level, causing damage
to the economy that poses a bigger threat to public welfare than
the removal of the subsidies.  Protesters in Khartoum’s Aviation Street chanted “the
people want the fall of the regime,” echoing the slogan of the
Arab uprisings of 2011. Demonstrations also erupted in other
areas in the capital, according to witnesses. Police spokesman
al-Ser Ahmed Omar in Khartoum didn’t immediately answer phone
calls seeking comment.  Schools in the capital will be closed until Sept. 30 amid
the violence, the official Sudan Media Center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
