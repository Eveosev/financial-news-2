Stanford Asia Holding Co., a unit
of Dubai-based oil and gas services company Stanford Marine
Group, raised a $300 million loan to replace existing debt.  The five-year syndicated facility was arranged by  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) ,  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , Mubadala GE Capital PJSC and
Noor Islamic Bank PJSC, according to an e-mailed statement from
 Standard Chartered  in Dubai today. The facility was
oversubscribed with  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) , Barwa Bank,
 Mashreqbank PSC (MASQ)  also joining as arrangers.  Buyout firm Abraaj Group, which owns 51 percent of Stanford
Marine, plans an initial public offering of the company in
 London , a person familiar with the plan said Sept. 15. The share
sale of the company, which charters, builds and repairs offshore
support vessels for the oil and gas industry, will probably take
place in the first quarter, the person said.  Syndicated loans in the  Middle East  and North Africa have
dropped 7.7 percent this year from the same period a year ago to
$28.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Standard Chartered have been the biggest
arrangers of loans this year, the data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
