Country Garden Holdings Co. (2007) , a
Chinese developer, and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. are
marketing U.S. dollar-denominated bonds as  default risk  in  Asia 
falls for the first time in almost a week.  Issuers in Asia outside  Japan  have sold $9.9 billion of
notes in September, already the busiest month since May, when
$17.6 billion was borrowed. Country Garden, controlled by
 China ’s richest woman, is offering 2021 debentures at a yield of
about 7.75 percent, a person familiar with the matter said.
Korea Hydro is marketing five-year debt at an about 170 basis-point spread over Treasuries, another person said.  Borrowers are returning to the debt-capital markets after
the quietest August since 2011 following news the  Federal
Reserve  will refrain from cutting its $85 billion-a-month in
asset purchases. Asian dollar bond yields averaged  5.35 percent 
yesterday, close to a six-week low of 5.29 percent reached on
Sept. 19, the day after the Fed’s decision, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
indexes show. Yields fell 22 basis points that day, the most
since March 2009.  “Syndicate bankers will be pushing to get as many deals
out as possible while the markets are stable,” said Shankar Narayanaswamy, the Singapore-based global head of credit
strategy at Standard Chartered Plc. “The Fed’s decision last
week caused Treasuries to dip, making it a good time for issuers
to price deals at low all-in yields.”  Korea Hydro  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 3 basis points to 151 basis
points as of 8:35 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  prices show. The benchmark last declined on
Sept. 19, according to data provider CMA.  U.S. government notes were poised to snap a three-day rally
today. Benchmark 10-year  yields  were little changed at 2.66
percent as of 11:55 a.m. in  Tokyo , based on Bloomberg Bond
Trader data.  Korea Hydro, a unit of  Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760) , the
state-run power monopoly distributor, last sold securities in
the U.S. currency in September last year. Those $750 million of
3 percent notes due 2022 were yielding 4.02 percent as of 12:40
p.m. in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg prices.  Country Garden last visited the market in January, when it
raised $750 million selling 10-year 7.5 percent debt, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Risk  Woori Bank Co. sold $500 million of 2.875 percent 2018
bonds yesterday while  Bangkok Bank Pcl (BBL)  raised $500 million
selling similar-maturity 3.3 percent notes, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. investors bought 28 percent of
Woori’s deal, while European accounts took 17 percent, a person
familiar with the matter said today.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 1 basis point to 118
as of 10:22 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia Bank
Ltd. prices. The gauge is set to snap three consecutive days of
increases, according to data from CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 1 basis point to
90.75 basis points as of 9:37 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The measure is also poised for its first
decline since Sept. 19, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default. Traders use them to speculate on  credit
quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
