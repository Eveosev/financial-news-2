Canadian  stocks  fell, after a two-day advance, as declines among telephone and consumer-staples
companies offset a rally among raw-material shares amid the
first gain in commodities prices in five days.  Torex Gold Resources Inc. and Yamana Gold Inc. gained at
least 3 percent as the price of the metal snapped three days of
losses.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) ,  Canada ’s largest diversified miner,
rose 1.4 percent as base metals prices advanced. Telus Corp. and
BCE Inc. fell more than 1 percent as phone stocks retreated for
the first time in nine days.  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  slumped 5.8 percent
as investors continued to digest a potential $4.7 billion
takeover by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 12.18
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,836.71 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark Canadian equity gauge has surged 5.8 percent this
quarter and is up 3.2 percent in 2013.  “Today, the market has gold going for it,” said  Keith Richards ,  fund manager  with ValueTrend Wealth Management in
Barrie, Ontario. His firm manages about C$110 million ($107
million). “The banks have supported the TSX, but they’re maybe
a bit overbought, so it’s time to take a pause. I don’t see what
else could really drive the TSX. It needs a catalyst and there
isn’t one right now.”  Commodities Prices  Raw-materials stocks gained 1.4 percent as a group, the
only increase among 10 industries in the S&P/TSX. Trading volume
was 2.8 percent lower than the 30-day average.  “From time to time you see rebounds there in commodities,
but the prices are stuck in a range,” said Stephen Gauthier,
chief investment officer with Fin-XO Securities Inc. in
 Montreal . His firm manages about C$550 million. “What you need
to see that change is stronger growth worldwide. That’s what
people are waiting for.”  Alongside improvements in Europe and  China , economic data
in the U.S. will need to show signs beyond growth in real
estate, Gauthier said. A report today showed U.S. new home sales
in August climbed 7.9 percent compared with a revised 14 percent
plunge in July.  Alacer Gold Corp. surged 9.6 percent to C$3.42. The gold
producer, which is selling mines in  Australia , said yesterday it
expects to decide on an expansion at its Copler operation in
 Turkey  by the end of 2014.  Torex Gold added 4.3 percent to C$1.46 and Yamana Gold rose
3 percent to C$11.01. Gold for December delivery increased 1.5
percent to $1,336.20 an ounce in  New York . The price had
declined 3.9 percent in the past three sessions.  Endeavour Silver Corp. climbed 6.6 percent to C$4.71 as
silver futures rose 1.4 percent, snapping a three-day, 7.3
percent slide.  Base Metals  Teck Resources rose 1.4 percent to C$28.58 and First
Quantum Minerals Ltd. rallied 1 percent to C$19.27 as base
metals including copper, aluminum, zinc, tin and lead advanced.
Stockpiles of copper monitored by the London Metal Exchange fell
for a 15th session.  Telus lost 2.2 percent to C$34.78 and BCE Inc. fell 1
percent to C$44.13 as telephone stocks slumped 1.1 percent, the
first decline since Sept. 12. Telus, BCE and Rogers
Communications Inc. have signaled their intent to bid in a
wireless spectrum auction that didn’t include any submissions
from major foreign companies.  CGI Group Inc. (GIB/A)  rose 0.3 percent to C$36.85, a record high,
after the technology services company said it has signed an
eight-year deal worth 75 million British pounds ($121 million)
with Smart DCC Ltd. to develop and operate a system to link gas
and electricity meters for  utility companies .  BlackBerry Slumps  BlackBerry, the smartphone maker, slumped 5.8 percent to
C$8.27, the lowest close since November 2012.  On Sept. 23, BlackBerry said it had agreed to a tentative
deal to sell itself to a group led by Fairfax, the largest
company shareholder. The sale, for $9 a share in cash, is still
subject to several conditions including securing financing and
due diligence.  BlackBerry has plunged 24 percent in the past four days,
since announcing on Sept. 20 worse-than-estimated  earnings  and
smartphone sales for its second quarter and plans to fire 4,500
employees.  Consumer-staples shares slid 0.7 percent. Maple Leaf Foods
Inc., the Canadian food processor, retreated 2.3 percent to C$13
for its fifth straight loss. Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., the
largest public convenience-store operator in  North America ,
tumbled 2.4 percent to C$63.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
