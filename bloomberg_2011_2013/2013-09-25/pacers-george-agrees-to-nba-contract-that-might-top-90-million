All-Star forward  Paul George  signed
a multiyear contract extension with the  Indiana Pacers  that can
be worth more than $90 million.  George averaged 17.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 4.1 assists and
1.8 steals a game for the Pacers last season, his third in the
 National Basketball Association . He won the NBA’s Most Improved
Player Award, was selected as an All-Star for the first time and
helped Indiana reach the conference finals.  The Pacers didn’t disclose terms of George’s contract in a
news release. ESPN reported this week that the two sides
completed a five-year extension at the NBA’s maximum, giving
George, 23, about $80 million in guaranteed money. The value of
the contract would increase to more than $90 million if he makes
an All-NBA team or wins a Most Valuable Player award after the
2013-14 season, ESPN reported.  “I want to thank the Pacers for believing in me when they
drafted me,” said George, who was the NBA’s 10th pick in 2010
out of Fresno State. “To continue my career with the Pacers was
a very easy decision.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
