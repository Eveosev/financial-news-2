Europe is at risk of a re-introduction of polio, more than a decade after the region was
declared free of the disease, after the disfiguring virus was
found in sewage in  Israel , according to a European Union report.  Poliovirus was identified in 91 sewage samples in Israel
between February and August, and in the feces of 42 people in
the same area, the  European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control  wrote in a report today. No cases of polio disease have
been reported, the Stockholm-based ECDC said.  Frequent travel between Israel and Europe has created “a
likelihood that poliovirus may be imported and re-established”
in the European Union and the European Economic Area, the ECDC
said. While the risk of infection is “very low” among people
who’ve received the oral polio vaccine, it’s high among those
who haven’t been vaccinated, according to the  report .  “Israel is a popular destination for EU travelers and vice
versa,” the ECDC said. “Orthodox religious groups, among whom
low vaccination coverage is often reported, are likely to be at
increased risk.”  Israeli authorities have acted to prevent the spread of the
virus, and European nations should make an effort to identify
and target people who aren’t adequately protected by vaccine,
the ECDC said.  “If wild-type poliovirus can re-emerge in Israel, with a
comparable health-care system and polio vaccination coverage to
much of the EU, then we must accept that there is risk that it
could re-emerge” in  Europe , ECDC Director Marc Sprenger said in
a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
