Infotech Enterprises Ltd. (INFTC) , an
Indian software services provider to aerospace and automotive
industries, plans to acquire at least one company in the U.S.
this year to expand in its biggest market.  The firm, backed by  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , will use part of its
6 billion rupees ($96 million) cash for the purchase, Chairman
and Managing Director B.V.R. Mohan Reddy said in an interview
yesterday. The Hyderabad, India-based company has acquired nine
rivals in the U.S. and  Europe  since 1997, according to the
company’s website.  Infotech plans to utilize its record  cash  pile to expand
and revive profit after net income dropped for two straight
quarters. The company may spend about $25 million on the
acquisition, Reddy said, without identifying a target.  The company’s cash reserves “in the best of times, is not
giving more than 9 percent return,” Reddy said. “So,
understandably, we are very keen that we should go toward
acquisitions.”  Infotech’s  shares , which have gained 6 percent this year,
rose 2.1 percent to 190 rupees at 2:44 p.m. in Mumbai, the
highest since Dec. 19. First Carlyle Ventures Mauritius owns 9.9
percent in the company as on June 30, according to exchange
filings.  North America   accounts  for more than half of Infotech’s
revenue, while it generates about 27 percent of sales in Europe,
according to Reddy. The company’s sales rose 6 percent to 4.8
billion rupees in the three months ended June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
