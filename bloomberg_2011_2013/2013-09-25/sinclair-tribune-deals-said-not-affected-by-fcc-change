A change in U.S. rules to restrict
the growth of television-station groups wouldn’t affect pending
acquisitions such as those proposed by  Sinclair Broadcast Group
Inc. (SBGI)  and  Tribune Co. (TRBAA) , people familiar with the matter said.  A rule being written at the Federal Communications
Commission wouldn’t apply to existing or pending combinations of
TV stations, said two agency officials who asked not to be
identified because the matter hasn’t been made public.  The FCC is to vote tomorrow on the rule proposed by the
agency’s acting chairwoman, Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat. The
agency would then take public comments until a final vote that
would probably take place under Tom Wheeler, who awaits Senate
confirmation as FCC chairman.  Justin Cole, an FCC spokesman, in an e-mail declined to
comment.  Clyburn wants to do away with a regulatory discount that
calculates audience reach of some TV stations at 50 percent of
others when assessing compliance with ownership limits. Congress
set a limit for a company’s reach at 39 percent of the national
TV audience.  To contact the reporter on this story:
