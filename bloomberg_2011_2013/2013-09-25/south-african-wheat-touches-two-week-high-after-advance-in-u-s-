Wheat futures traded in South
 Africa  reached a two-week high after the grain advanced in the
U.S. market yesterday.  Wheat for delivery in December, the most active contract,
rose 0.4 percent to 3,370 rand ($340) a metric ton by the noon
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg.
That was the highest price since Sept. 11. Wheat for the same
delivery month gained for a fifth session in six yesterday on
the Chicago Board of Trade.  “Our wheat is up today due to the U.S. crop that went
up,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by phone
from Perth,  Australia .  South Africa, a net importer of wheat, is sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia  and the
region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan , according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  White corn for delivery in December was little changed at
2,310.60 rand a ton, while the yellow variety for the same
delivery month dropped 0.4 percent to 2,140 rand a ton.  South Africa is the continent’s largest corn producer. A
meal made from the white variety is one of the nation’s staple
foods and yellow corn is mostly fed to animals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
