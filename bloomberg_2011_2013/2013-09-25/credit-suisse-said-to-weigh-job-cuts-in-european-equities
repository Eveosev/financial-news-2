Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s second-largest bank, may trim jobs at the Europe,
Middle East and Africa equities business, three people familiar
with the plan said.  An e-mail was sent to staff in the region last week
informing them of the start of consultations that may include
cutbacks, two of the people said, asking not to be identified as
the plan is private. The process will start in coming weeks, the
people said. A Credit Suisse official declined to comment.  Investment banks operating in Europe, from  Barclays Plc (BARC)  to
UniCredit SpA and  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , have cut their equities
businesses amid a decline in trading volumes and profitability.
Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, is in the midst of a cost-reduction plan that seeks to save 4.4 billion Swiss francs ($4.8
billion) by the end of 2015.  Trading commissions in  Europe  have declined since peaking
in 2009 and brokers aren’t planning for a rebound, consulting
firm Greenwich Associates said in a report last month.  “The answer to the question ‘is there any relief in sight’
is simply ‘no,’” Greenwich Associates consultant Jay Bennett
said in a statement accompanying the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
