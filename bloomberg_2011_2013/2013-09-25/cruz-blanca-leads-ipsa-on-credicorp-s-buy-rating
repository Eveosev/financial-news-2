Cruz Blanca Salud SA (CRUZBLAN) ,  Chile ’s
third-largest health insurer and medical-services provider, was
the best performer on the benchmark IPSA stock index after
Credicorp Capital recommended buying the shares.  The shares climbed 4.3 percent to 386 pesos at 2:01 p.m. in
Santiago, the highest on a closing basis since Sept. 10. The
IPSA retreated 0.7 percent.  Credicorp Capital reinstated coverage of Cruz Blanca with a
buy rating, saying in an e-mailed research note to clients today
that the stock is a way to tap into Chile’s economic growth as
life expectancy increases. The bank set a price target of 460
pesos for the Santiago-based company.  “We continue to believe in the positive perspectives of
the company for the long term,” analysts Javier Gunther and
Francisca Manuschevich wrote in the note. “Current prices
provide an attractive entry point.”  Cruz Blanca pared its decline this year to 36 percent, the
fifth-worst performance among  IPSA (IPSA)  companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
