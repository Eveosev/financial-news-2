Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the
insurer that delayed an initial public offering of its  Australia 
mortgage guarantor in 2012, said yesterday that the IPO will
probably come in 2014 rather than this year.  There is “more likelihood maybe we push it into 2014,
versus now” Chief Executive Officer Tom McInerney said at a
conference sponsored by KBW LLC. “I think there will be
regulatory uncertainty into 2014.”  Former CEO Michael Fraizer resigned in May 2012 after
delaying the IPO the previous month following a loss at the
unit. McInerney said in July that Genworth was targeting an
offering in the final three months of this year or later,
depending on Australia’s equity markets.  The Australian economy faces risks tied to its reliance on
commodities, including exports to  China , McInerney said
yesterday. He also said it is unclear how new rules on bank
capital will affect lenders’ use of home-loan guaranties.
Mortgage insurance covers losses when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  Growth in the Australian economy is expected to slow to 2.5
percent this year from 3.7 percent in 2012, according to the
median of 35 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Australia’s
 S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  has climbed 13 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with the 19 percent rally of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index in the U.S.  Genworth rose 3.9 percent to $12.73 at the close yesterday
in New York, extending gains for The Richmond, Virginia-based
company to 70 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
