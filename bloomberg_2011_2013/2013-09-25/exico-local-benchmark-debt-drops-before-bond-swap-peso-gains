Mexico’s benchmark bonds fell,
pushing yields to a one-week high, before a debt swap in which
the government will offer more of the debt maturing in 2024 to
extend maturities.  Yields on the securities climbed three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.98 percent at 10:14 a.m. in Mexico
City, the highest level on a closing basis since Sept. 17. The
currency climbed less than 0.1 percent to 12.9383 per dollar.  “In a market still sensitive to duration, the exchange
places some pressure” on the maturities, though it should be
short-lived, Alejandro Urbina, who helps oversee $800 million at
Silva Capital Management LLC, including Mexican  government
bonds , said in an e-mailed response to questions. “The pressure
is on the belly, where the supply will be.”  Mexico plans to issue as much as 20 billion pesos in
securities due from 2017 to 2024 today in exchange for shorter-term bonds maturing from 2014 to 2016. The auction will be held
from 12:30 p.m. to 1 p.m. local time.  Yields on the 2024 bonds tumbled 30 basis points last week
in the biggest decline since June 2012 after the U.S. Federal
Reserve said it wasn’t reducing the pace of a monetary stimulus
program that has supported emerging-market securities. The
yields are still up 56 basis points in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
