The pound strengthened toward an
eight-month high against the dollar after a gauge of U.K. retail
sales unexpectedly increased in September, adding to signs the
U.K. economy is improving.  Sterling rose versus all of its 16 major counterparts
before a report tomorrow that analysts said will confirm the
U.K. economy expanded last quarter. The pound has been the best
performer in the past six months, appreciating 5.8 percent
against the dollar. U.K. government bonds rose after  Bank of
England  policy maker  David Miles  said it would be misguided to
expect an early interest-rate increase.  “Retail sales are a massive part of the recovery so the
number was in focus,” said Eimear Daly, a London-based
currency-market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. “That’s why it had
such a big impact on the pound. In the short term, it looks like
there is more momentum behind sterling-dollar however I would be
cautious holding the pound as we head into the fourth quarter.”  The pound advanced 0.4 percent to $1.6070 at 4:33 p.m.
London time after rising to $1.6163 on Sept. 18, the highest
level since Jan. 11. The U.K. currency was little changed at
84.22 pence per euro after appreciating to 83.53 pence on Sept.
18, the strongest since Jan. 17.  A gauge of annual retail sales growth rose to 34, the most
since June 2012, from 27 in August, the  Confederation of British
Industry  said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a drop
to 23. Gross domestic product expanded 0.7 percent in the second
quarter, a separate survey showed before the  Office for National
Statistics  releases the data tomorrow.  Economic Slack  The pound has risen 1.4 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar strengthened 2.7 percent
and the euro gained 5.7 percent.  Ten-year gilts rose for a third day after Miles wrote in
the Evening Standard newspaper that sustained growth was needed
to remove slack from the economy and it’s mistaken to think an
early increase in  interest rates  is needed.  The Bank of England led by Governor  Mark Carney  introduced
interest-rate guidance last month, pledging to keep borrowing
costs low until the  unemployment rate  falls to 7 percent. It was
7.7 percent in the three months through July.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.76 percent after declining to 2.75
percent, the lowest level since Aug. 30. The 2.25 percent bond
due in September 2023 rose 0.33, or 3.30 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 95.635.  ‘Very Nervous’  The 10-year yield dropped 12 basis points yesterday, the
most since August, as Bank of England Deputy Governor  Paul Tucker  said the central bank was in “no rush” to withdraw
monetary stimulus.  “It’s dawning on people that central banks are still very
nervous about the recovery,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Corp. in London. “The market is
paring back on the extent it was disagreeing with the Bank of
England’s forecasts.”  Gilts lost 3.7 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bunds dropped
1.9 percent and Treasuries fell 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
