Malaysia  will sell 30-year bonds
for the first time in its longest-maturity offering to set a
benchmark for companies raising funds under Prime Minister Najib
Razak’s $444 billion development program.  The government will sell 2.5 billion ringgit ($776 million)
of 2043 notes tomorrow, according to the central bank’s website.
Pre-market trading showed bid to offer yields were 4.35 percent
to 4.75 percent today, said  Michael Chang , head of fixed income
at MCIS Zurich Insurance Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. Similar-maturity
 U.S. Treasuries  were paying 3.67 percent and 30-year Thai debt
4.6 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The maturity extension will add more depth to the region’s
biggest bond market given that  Thailand  and  Indonesia  already
have debt maturing in 30 years or beyond, Chang said. Highway
operator PLUS Bhd. is only the second Malaysian company to have
issued securities due in more than 25 years, along with
sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd., as Najib
embarks on a 10-year spending spree to build roads, railways and
power plants.  “The offering will help facilitate  project financing ,”
Soo Seohan, head of debt capital markets at AmInvestment Bank
Bhd., Malaysia’s second-biggest bond arranger this year, said in
an interview in  Kuala Lumpur  yesterday. “Demand will be there
given that insurance companies and pension funds need to match
their assets with liabilities.”  Chang said he’s keen to buy the debt because it’s an
inaugural issue.  Inflation Risk  Yields on 20-year notes, currently the longest government
maturity in Malaysia, are falling three times as fast as rates
on three-year debt this month. Long-term securities are more
sensitive to expectations for  consumer prices , which rose 1.9
percent in August, compared with 2 percent in July and 1.2
percent in December when the 30-year bond plan was announced.  The  extra  yield investors demand to hold the 20-year
government notes over those due in three years narrowed 24 basis
points to 78 in September, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s down from 2013’s high of 120 on Sept. 4.  “Given that inflation is expected to rise further, we
would only be interested in the 30-year bonds if the yields are
above 5 percent,” Lam Chee Mun, a Kuala Lumpur-based fund
manager at TA Investment Management Bhd., which oversees around
650 million ringgit, said in an interview yesterday. “At the
moment, we feel that other asset classes give better returns.”  Longer-term bonds are more viable for countries building
infrastructure because you get a maturity mismatch if your
fundraising is in the short end, Iwan Azis, head of the  Asian
Development Bank ’s regional economic integration office in
 Manila , said in a Sept. 23 phone interview.  “If Malaysia is doing successfully, then I’m pretty sure
other neighboring countries will follow suit,” Azis said.  Currency Rebound  Malaysia’s currency rebounded in September following four
straight months of losses. The ringgit appreciated 1.8 percent
from Aug. 30 to 3.2253 per dollar as of 10:30 a.m. in Kuala
Lumpur today. Still, it’s the third-worst performing exchange
rate in Southeast Asia this year with a 5.2 percent loss after
Indonesia’s rupiah and the Philippine peso.  Thailand sold 50-year debt, Southeast Asia’s longest-maturity sovereign notes, in December 2010. The maximum
government debt duration in the  Philippines  is 25 years and 15
in  Vietnam , data compiled by Bloomberg show. In  Singapore , it’s
30 years. Those bonds yielded 3.16 percent yesterday, compared
with 3.51 percent at the end of August.  Malaysia had $314 billion of debt outstanding as of June 30,
compared with $286 billion in Thailand, $118 billion in
Indonesia and $95 billion in the Philippines, according to
 report  from the Asian Development Bank this week.  Insurance Drops  The government’s development spending helped contribute to
one of the highest levels of debt in  Southeast Asia  at 53.3
percent of gross domestic product, compared with 23 percent in
Indonesia, 51.5 percent in the Philippines and 44.5 percent in
Thailand, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Malaysia and Singapore spent 2.3 percent of their GDP on
infrastructure in 2011, compared with 1.5 percent in Thailand
and 1.6 percent in the Philippines, the ADB report said.  The cost to insure Malaysian  government bonds  for five
years dropped 28 basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, to 122
this month, CMA default prices show. That’s down from the 2013
high of 157 on Aug. 27.  Issuance of bonds in the nation dropped 60 percent to 37.8
billion ringgit this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales reached a record 117.8 billion ringgit in 2012
as companies raised funds to help finance projects under the
government’s economic transformation initiative.  “Malaysia’s 30-year bond will extend the yield curve and
deepen the local market,”  Jason Chong , who oversees $1 billion
as chief investment officer at Manulife Asset Management
Services Bhd., said in a Sept. 23 interview in Kuala Lumpur.  To contact the reporter on this story:
