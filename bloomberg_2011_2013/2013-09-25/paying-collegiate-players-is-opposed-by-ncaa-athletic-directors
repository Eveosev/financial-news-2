Athletic directors at the biggest
college football schools closed their annual meeting by taking a
stand against paying athletes and supporting an overhaul of how
college sports is managed.  The decision came as the  National Collegiate Athletic
Association  is discussing reorganization, reviewing its policies
on rules enforcement and considering whether it should give
schools the option to spend for items like player stipends.  The debate reached football fields last weekend when 28
players, including Georgia Tech quarterback Vad Lee and
Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter, wrote the words “All
Players United,” or “APU” on their uniforms in a call for
NCAA reform, the  New York  Times reported.  “Pay for play has no part in the amateur setting,” Morgan
Burke, president of the Division 1A Athletic Directors
Association and athletic director at  Purdue University , said in
a news release.  Burke said the value of a full scholarship and support
services for Purdue athletes is worth more than $250,000, and
that student-athletes with full scholarships have no loan to pay
back.  What’s more, integrity issues need to be handled
effectively in the enforcement system, which is currently under
review, she said.  “Institutions must clearly understand the meaning of
institutional control and must reinforce integrity as a core
value,” Burke said.  The player protest was organized by the  National College
Players Association . In a release on its website, the
association listed some of its goals as: minimizing brain trauma
risks, raising the scholarship amount, preventing players from
being stuck with medical bills, eliminating restrictions on
legitimate employment and allowing players to benefit from
commercial opportunities, and guaranteeing athletes’ release if
they want to transfer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
