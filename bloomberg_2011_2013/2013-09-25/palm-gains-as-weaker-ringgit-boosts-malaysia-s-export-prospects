Palm oil climbed after data showed
exports from  Malaysia  are heading for a fourth month of advance,
aided by a weakening currency that boosts the appeal of ringgit-denominated futures.  Palm for December delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent to
2,316 ringgit ($716) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives and was at 2,306 ringgit by the midday break in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures lost 4.1 percent this month after
advancing the most in almost three years in August. Palm for
physical delivery in October was at 2,330 ringgit yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Shipments from the world’s second-largest producer rose 6.5
percent to 1.24 million tons in the first 25 days of September
from the same period a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said
today. Exports in August climbed 7.4 percent, the biggest gain
since March, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. The
ringgit fell against the dollar for a fourth day.  “A weaker ringgit makes palm oil cheaper for overseas
buyers and refiners, hence likely to boost export demand,” said
Say Hwa, head of investment at Phillip Futures Pte in  Singapore .  Soybeans for delivery in November rose 0.3 percent to
$13.17 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
December delivery gained 0.3 percent to 42.20 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery was little changed at
5,416  yuan  ($885) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil fell 0.2 percent to 7,070 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
