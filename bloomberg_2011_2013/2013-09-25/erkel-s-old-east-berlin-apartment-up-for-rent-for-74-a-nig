Angela Merkel , who just won a third
term as German Chancellor, lived in a small apartment in East
Berlin when the Wall fell. For less than $75, you can now spend
a night there.  The 55-square-meter (592-square-foot) apartment in the
Prenzlauer Berg district is available for 55 euros a night,
according to a  listing  at online rental agency Airbnb Inc.  “Our chancellor has lived within these walls,” the person
who’s offering the home, identified only as Lene, writes in the
listing. An e-mail seeking comment from her wasn’t immediately
returned.  Merkel was renting the second-floor apartment when the
 Berlin Wall  fell in 1989, giving potential guests a taste of
history,  Bild  newspaper reported today. The property has a
bedroom, living room and a kitchen with a checkered-tiled floor,
equipped with a coffee machine and a microwave oven, according
to the listing.  Merkel moved into the apartment at Schoenhauser Allee 104
after squatting in an abandoned apartment on nearby Templiner
Strasse, the Chancellor told Spiesser magazine earlier this
month. When the Wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989, Merkel, then 35,
didn’t initially cross the border. First she went to the sauna
with friends and only later ventured across the Bornholmer
Bridge to what was then West Berlin, according to Bild.  A government spokesman confirmed that Merkel lived in the
building, though he couldn’t say whether she lived in the same
apartment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
