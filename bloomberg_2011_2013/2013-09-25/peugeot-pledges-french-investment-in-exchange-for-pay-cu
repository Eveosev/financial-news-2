PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  pledged to
increase French production and investments over the next three
years in exchange for concessions from unions such as a salary
freeze and reduced overtime pay.  Europe ’s second-largest carmaker will spend 1.5 billion
euros ($2 billion) to upgrade French factories through 2016 as
part of plan to raise output 7.5 percent to at least 1 million
autos, the Paris-based company said in a statement today.
Peugeot also vowed to build at least one new model in each of
its five French assembly plants in the coming three years,
helping to maintain work at components plants and foundries.  Peugeot, which reported a first-half operating loss of 510
million euros in its automotive division, started talks with
unions in May after agreeing on a cost-reduction plan that
includes the elimination of 11,200 jobs by 2015 and the closing
of a factory on the outskirts of Paris. Peugeot is offering not
to shut any additional French plants in the next three years as
part of the latest negotiations.  “This is the minimum we were asking for,” said Anne Valleron, one of two employee representatives on the company’s
board. “But this is not sufficient. We still need to discuss
all the details of these very broad proposals and see what will
be their actual impacts on jobs in each factory.”  Shares Rise  The shares  gained  as much as 10.5 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
12.70 euros and were up 0.3 percent as of 5:02 p.m. in Paris
trading. The stock has more than doubled this year, valuing the
auto manufacturer at 4.48 billion euros.  The talks between Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin
and labor leaders are aimed at improving the competitiveness of
the automaker’s French factories and bring their utilization
rate to 100 percent in 2016 from 61 percent in the first half.
The manufacturer agreed to maintain 75 percent of research and
development in the country through 2016 if a deal is reached.  Today’s meeting was the 12th between the two sides over
topics spanning from working conditions to overtime pay and
salaries. Peugeot is asking unions to cut additional overtime
pay by 20 percent to 25 percent and to freeze salaries in 2014.  Peugeot  employed  76,136 people in its automotive division
in  France  at end of 2012, representing 65 percent of its
automotive workforce. The carmaker aims to sell more than 50
percent of its vehicles outside Europe by 2015 and has added
production in  China ,  Russia  and  Latin America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
