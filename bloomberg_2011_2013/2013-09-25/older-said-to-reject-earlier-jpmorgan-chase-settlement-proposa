U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
told government negotiators working on a possible settlement
with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  that the companyâ€™s initial proposal
fell far short of an acceptable payment amount, according to a
person with knowledge of the case.  At the early stages of the negotiations this week, the
company was proposing a settlement of between $3 billion and $4
billion, a separate person with knowledge of the negotiations
said. Those numbers were rejected by the government, said the
person.  Subsequent proposals have reached higher dollar amounts,
according to the person, who said that the numbers, as well as
how the settlement money may be disbursed, are still subject to
change. Both people requested anonymity to describe private
negotiations.  JPMorgan is seeking to negotiate an accord resolving
mortgage-bond investigations being conducted by federal and
state authorities, according to one of the people.  Adora Andy Jenkins, a Justice Department spokeswoman,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
