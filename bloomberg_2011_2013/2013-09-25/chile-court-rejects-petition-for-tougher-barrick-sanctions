Chile’s  Supreme Court  turned down
an indigenous community request to place additional measures
against  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ’s stalled Pascua-Lama project.  In a unanimous ruling, Chile’s highest court rejected a
petition filed by the Diaguitas indigenous community seeking to
rescind the project’s environment license, the Judiciary said on
its website today. The Supreme Court upheld a regional tribunal
ruling in July ordering Barrick to complete water resource
mitigation work before a work suspension can be lifted.  Construction on the Chilean side of Pascua-Lama, the gold
and silver project on the border with  Argentina , has been halted
since April when a court granted an injunction filed by the
Diaguitas concerned that Barrick would contaminate local water
supplies.  Chile ’s environment agency later ordered work to
improve protections before the project can restart.  Barrick said June 28 it will reschedule work so that the
project’s processing plant in Argentina is completed at the same
time as the first ore is ready from the mining operations, most
of which are located in Chile. The company said at the time that
first production from Pascua-Lama is expected in mid-2016,
compared with a previous target of the second half of 2014.  Barrick raised the cost estimate for the mine twice in
2012, to as much as $8.5 billion, and said last month it expects
to provide an increased estimate later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
