Spain’s anti-corruption prosecutor
accused 61 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP partners of committing tax
crimes, saying they failed to declare a total of 21 million
euros ($28.4 million) in bonus payments.  The  PwC  partners categorized the 2002 bonus payments as
part of the price of the sale of a consulting division to IBM
that carried a lower tax rate, the prosecutor said in an e-mailed statement today. The agency presented a written
accusation requesting a criminal trial, according to the
statement.  “The partners omitted to establish in their tax returns
that the sums were payments from work,” the prosecutor said.  PwC “roundly denies” the accusations against its partners
and is convinced that the case will be thrown out once the truth
is recognized, the firm’s Madrid office said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “There has been no concealment or fraud,” PwC said. “All
the operations and amounts have been declared and formulated
with all the legal requirements.”  Spain is clamping down on tax evasion as part of its drive
to tackle a budget deficit that risks slipping from its target.
The budget shortfall, excluding municipalities, was 5.27 percent
of gross domestic product in the first seven months of the year,
compared with a full-year target of 6.5 percent.  The prosecutor is seeking jail terms of as much as 14 years
and 10 months and fines of more than 102 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
