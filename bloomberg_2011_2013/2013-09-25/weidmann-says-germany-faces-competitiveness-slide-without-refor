Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said  Germany ’s aging society faces a slow decline in its
competitive position that could harm  Europe  unless its enacts a
range of economic reforms.  “An economic advantage can go to waste,” Weidmann said
during a speech in Dusseldorf today. “The demographic burden,
as well as the catching-up process of other countries could lead
to a creeping erosion of the competitiveness of the German
economy. Germany is the anchor of stability in the euro area,
without whom efforts to stabilize the region would have no
credibility.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democrats won
the largest share of the vote in a federal election on Sept. 22
and she may now face a protracted process of coalition building
before a policy agenda can be completed. Weidmann said there’s a
“particular need for action” in labor-market policy,
immigration, education, infrastructure as well as reform of the
federal fiscal transfer structure.  “Flexibility and innovation in the economy have to be
increased, sustainable state finances and the system of social
security have to be secured,” he said. “To mitigate the aging-induced slowing of the economy, extra drivers of growth have to
be mobilized.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
