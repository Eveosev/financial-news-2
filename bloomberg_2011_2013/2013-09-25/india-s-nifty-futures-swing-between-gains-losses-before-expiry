Most Indian stocks gained, led by
industrials and utilities.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT)  rose for a second day as the nation’s
top engineering company is said to be considering a Singapore
listing for its toll-road projects that could raise about $700
million. Power generator NTPC Ltd. gained for a second day.  Two stocks rose for one that fell on the S&P BSE  Sensex (SENSEX) ,
which gained 0.1 percent to 19,933.40 at 9:47 a.m. in Mumbai,
after changing direction at least six times. The 30-stock index
has  veered  between a one-year low and a 34-month high the past
four weeks. The gauge tumbled as the rupee weakened to a record
low last month and rallied after central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan announced plans to boost the financial industry and shore
up the rupee, and the  Federal Reserve  maintained stimulus.  Overseas funds  sold a net $4.2 million of domestic shares
on Sept. 23, data from the regulator showed yesterday. That cut
this year’s net inflow to $13.4 billion, the second-highest
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. They pulled $3.7
billion from local equities in the three months to Aug. 31 as
capital fled  emerging markets  amid prospects of the Federal
Reserve paring its record stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
