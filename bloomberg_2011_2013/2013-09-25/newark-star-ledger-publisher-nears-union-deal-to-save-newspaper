The  Newark Star-Ledger ,  New
Jersey ’s largest newspaper, is nearing an agreement with its
unions that could save the publication from a shutdown.  “The negotiations have been cooperative, and we’re making
progress,” Richard Vezza, the newspaper’s publisher, said in an
interview. Even so, a deal isn’t yet imminent, he said.  Earlier this month, the publisher told the unions that the
company would close the newspaper by the end of the year if the
unions didn’t give up $9 million in concessions by Sept. 27.
Vezza said today that he’s left it up to the unions to decide
where the cost savings will come from.  Ed Shown, who represents a coalition of unions serving the
paper’s staff, didn’t respond to requests for comment.  The Star-Ledger, owned by billionaire Si Newhouse and his
family, has been operating in the red for at least the past two
years, according to Vezza. The loss exceeded $19 million last
year and the company will likely see a similar deficit this
year, he said.  The paper’s parent company, Advance Publications Inc.,
has been cutting back on staff and circulation at its other
publications amid an industrywide slump. Advertisers and readers
are increasingly switching to the Internet, where ad rates are
cheaper and the content is largely free.  The Star-Ledger is the 15th-largest newspaper in the U.S.
with an average weekday circulation of 340,778, according to  
figures  from the Alliance for Audited Media.  The  New York  Post  reported  earlier that the two sides were
closing in on an agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
