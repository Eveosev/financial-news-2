West Texas Intermediate rebounded
from four days of losses before U.S. data that’s forecast to
show stockpiles dropped in the world’s largest oil consumer.  Futures rose as much as 0.6 percent before a government
report today that may show crude inventories slid 1 million
barrels to an 18-month low last week. The industry-funded
 American Petroleum Institute  said supplies fell 54,000 barrels.
WTI dropped to the lowest close in eight weeks yesterday on
speculation that U.S.-Iranian relations are thawing and as the
threat of an American military strike on  Syria  receded.  “U.S. inventory figures will be one of the highlights
today, especially as we’re moving out of driving season,” said
Thina Saltvedt, an analyst at Nordea Bank AG in Oslo. “We’ll
see how close WTI and Brent get, as things are calming down in
 Libya  with production coming back.  Iran  is back to negotiating,
but there are still some doubts there.”  WTI crude for November delivery advanced as much as 61
cents to $103.74 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $103.32 as of 9:51 a.m. in London. Futures slid 4.6
percent over the previous four sessions. The volume of all
futures traded was 6 percent below the 100-day average. Prices
are up 6.9 percent this quarter and 12.4 percent higher in 2013.  Supply Forecast  Brent for November settlement gained 67 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $109.31 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark traded at a premium of
$6.03 to WTI. The spread was at $5.51 yesterday, the widest
since Sept. 6.  U.S. crude inventories fell 0.3 percent to 354.6 million
barrels as of Sept. 20, according to the median of 10 analyst
estimates surveyed before the Energy Information Administration
report. Supplies probably dropped as refineries operated at more
than 90 percent of capacity and oil imports slipped.  The EIA, the U.S. Energy Department’s statistical arm, is
scheduled to release its inventory report at 10:30 a.m. today in
 Washington . The data will show stockpiles of gasoline slid
750,000 barrels and middle distillates, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, lost 925,000 barrels last week,
according to the Bloomberg survey.  API Report  The API’s weekly report yesterday showed distillate
inventories rose 485,000 while gasoline stockpiles increased
341,000 barrels. API collects information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA for its
weekly survey.  Supplies slipped in 10 of the past 12 EIA reports as
refineries  operated  near the highest rates of the year. Plants
have slowed fuel output in the third quarter of each year since
1999 as they implemented maintenance programs. Crude imports
decreased during September in four of the past five years.  Refineries probably ran at 91.6 percent of capacity on
Sept. 20, down 0.9 percentage point from a week earlier, the
survey showed. Units are often idled in September and October
for maintenance as attention shifts away from gasoline and
before heating-oil demand peaks.  Oil rose to a two-year high on Aug. 28 amid concern that a
U.S.-led assault would widen the Syrian conflict and disrupt
Middle East shipments.  The  United Nations Security Council  is set to negotiate a
Syria resolution. The U.S., the U.K. and  France  have accused
government forces of carrying out a chemical attack on Aug. 21
that killed 1,400 people near Damascus. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has blamed rebel groups.  Separately, U.S. President  Barack Obama  welcomed overtures
from Iran as a chance to resolve diplomatically the
confrontation over the Persian Gulf nation’s nuclear program,
even as Iranian officials told the U.S. that the time isn’t
right for direct contact between the two countries’ leaders.  Deutsche Bank AG increased its forecasts for WTI and Brent
crudes this year after prices rose in the third quarter. The
bank raised its outlook for WTI by 5 percent to $99.88 barrel
and Brent by 1.8 percent to $109, report e-mailed today showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
