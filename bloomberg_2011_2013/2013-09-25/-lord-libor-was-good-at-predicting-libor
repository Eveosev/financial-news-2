By this point regulators have brought a bunch of cases against banks and people who manipulated the London interbank offered rate and have learned some lessons from those cases. Perhaps the most important lesson is that these cases are sort of boring, but they are enlivened by just bushels of dumb e-mails and instant messages.  Everyone  just  pays attention  to the dumb e-mails and IMs. So today the U.S.  Department of Justice , U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission , and U.K.  Financial Conduct Authority  brought Libor charges against ICAP Plc, an interdealer broker, and some of its employees, and the CFTC was smart enough to put all the dumb stuff in one place, a document labeled  "Examples of Misconduct From Written Communications."  They're fun. In my book the two champions are this one: And this one:* By the way, that "Lord Bailiff" is not a one-off. "Cash Broker 1 referred to himself and was called by others by such monikers as 'Mr. LIBOR,' 'Lord LIBOR,' 'Lord Bailiff' and 'Mâ€™Lord.' " Of course he did. Beyond the general stupidity, the case is weirdly fascinating; it's like a  Keynesian beauty contest  in reverse. The story is that Tom Hayes was a swaps trader at UBS who made a lot of money trading Yen Libor swaps, and funneled a certain amount of that money into commissions paid to his interdealer swaps brokers at ICAP, Daniel Wilkinson and Darrell Read. One way that Hayes made a lot of money was by convincing Libor submitters at UBS and elsewhere to submit the Libors he wanted. (Background: Libor for any currency and tenor is, or  was anyway , set by the British Bankers Association polling a bunch of Libor submitters -- basically, cash traders at banks responsible for short-term borrowing -- and asking them "what rate do you pay to borrow [currency] for [tenor]?" The BBA would throw away the top and bottom few submissions and average the rest. So to move Libor you'd want to get at least a couple of banks to join you to actually push the trimmed average up.) Hayes convinced Libor submitters at UBS to submit the Libors he wanted in  the usual ways : rank, friendship, cajoling, bribes and general sitting-next-to-them. He convinced Libor submitters at other banks to submit the Libors he wanted through ICAP. He'd ask Wilkinson and Read to push Libor up or down, and since he was a big client, they tried to oblige.  The way they obliged was mainly by asking Colin Goodman, aka Cash Broker 1, aka Mr. LIBOR, aka Lord LIBOR, aka Lord Bailiff, aka M'Lord, to adjust his "suggested Libors." From the CFTC complaint:** The gist of the CFTC order, FCA final notice, and DOJ complaint is that these suggested Libors were fraudulent. How could they be fraudulent? Well, they would be fraudulent if they differed from Goodman's honest prediction of where Libor would set. What would be the harm of the fraud? Well, it would move Libor from Goodman's honest prediction of where Libor would set towards his dishonest suggested Libor. See the problem? The problem is that since Goodman's suggested Libors were influential -- since he was Lord Libor -- and since Libor is basically a made-up number representing banks' guesses at what rate they'd pay to borrow in markets where they don't actually borrow, his "false" predictions often ended up being more correct than his honest predictions. Because, y'know, they were self-fulfilling.*** From the DOJ complaint: Sic  throughout of course. Japanese Yen 1-month Libor fixed at 1.00375 percent that day. His honest prediction -- below 1 percent -- was wrong. Because he made it wrong. His fraudulent prediction -- 1.01 percent -- was closer to being right.**** Because he made it right. The exaggerated schematic is: Oh, I mean he did it anyway: The e-mails are just chock full of fraud. Fraud fraud fraud fraud fraud. But it's a weird sort of fraud: The dishonesty is plain enough in intention, yet metaphysically impossible. If your predictions just always come true how can they be dishonest? The CFTC has a theory, incidentally, but it's nuts: "Implicitly," here, means "not." When Viscount Libor sent an e-mail of suggested Libors, what he was doing was suggesting some Libors. You can tell because the heading was "SUGGESTED LIBORS." He would have been very surprised to hear that he was representing that those suggested Libors reflected his third-party unbiased assessment of borrowing costs and market pricing based on objective, observable data. You can tell from the rest of his e-mails. This is not unique to ICAP, though it's particularly acute here. The thing about Libor is that it was all about making up numbers: At the peak of the Libor scandal, banks didn't really borrow unsecured in most of the currencies and tenors in which they submitted Libors, so every number was made up. Nobody submitted a Libor that represented what it was supposed to represent -- their own cost of unsecured borrowing. The only question is one of intent: Were they trying to get Libor right, whatever that meant, or were they trying to fool people and make money on swaps? The behavior -- making up a number -- was the same either way.  ICAP is the second derivative of that: They weren't making up numbers, with evil in their hearts or otherwise. They were suggesting numbers for other people to make up.  Like the banks, ICAP more or less had to settle -- for $87ish million all in,  a chunky sum  for a small broker -- because the e-mails are so obviously terrible. These guys sure thought they were committing fraud, so it's hard for ICAP to fight. The three traders, who  supposedly  "face as long as 30 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charges," have rather more incentive to fight.  * From the CFTC complaint, but weirdly not in the highlights reel. Another stellar one from the complaint: NOTHING LIKE AN ALL-CAPS E-MAIL SAYING YOU SHOULD STOP DOING CRIMINAL STUFF OVER E-MAIL HUH? ** Just before that: *** As the DOJ complaint succinctly-ish puts it, nicely capturing the circularity: The CFTC is more emphatic about how much banks relied on the brokers: **** I guess that's debatable, maybe his honest prediction in his heart of hearts was like .99875. For what it's worth 1-month Yen Libor had fixed at 0.65625 percent the previous day, and fixed at .99625 percent the next day. There are other examples in the complaints; e.g. on August 9, 2007, Goodman sent out a run-thru with a 6-month suggested Libor of 0.93 percent. Later Hayes asked Read to ask him to move it higher. Goodman obliged, sending out an email titled "REVISED LIBORS" with a 6-month rate of 0.96 percent. The fixing was 0.9525 percent. Again, the dishonest prediction was more accurate than the honest one. ***** Not quite true; the DOJ complaint quotes an e-mail from Read to Hayes saying "like Colin said to me last night, he can try and tweak it by a point or 2 when its flying but if he marks too far from the truth the banks tend to ignore him."
