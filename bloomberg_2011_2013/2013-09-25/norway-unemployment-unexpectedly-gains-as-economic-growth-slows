Norway ’s unemployment rate
unexpectedly rose in July as growth slows in western Europe’s
largest crude exporter.  Unemployment increased to 3.6 percent from a revised 3.4
percent in June, Oslo-based  Statistics Norway  said on its
website today. Unemployment was seen at 3.3 percent, according
to the median estimate of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Norway’s central bank last week left its main interest rate
unchanged for a ninth meeting and signaled faster tightening as
 house prices  and consumer debt hover at record levels and the
krone has weakened. Mainland gross domestic product, which
excludes oil and gas production, will grow 1.75 percent this
year, after expanding 3.4 percent in 2012, the bank forecast  The $500 billion economy is struggling with a slowing
expansion just as the rest of  Europe  surfaces. The central bank
said last week that most areas of enterprise in the country,
including oil suppliers, have lowered growth estimates since the
start of the year and predicted “moderate growth” over the
next six months.  Norway’s oil wealth and investments in its offshore
industry has shielded the nation from a recession in the euro
area. While unemployment is up from 2012 levels, it remains
below the 11 percent rate in the European Union.  Norges Bank estimates unemployment will average 3.5 percent
this year and next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
