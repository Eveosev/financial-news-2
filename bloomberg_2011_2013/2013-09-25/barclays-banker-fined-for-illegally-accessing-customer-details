A  Barclays Plc (BARC)  employee was fined
3,360 pounds ($5,400) for illegally accessing a customer’s
account to pass on personal details to a friend, the U.K.
authority in charge of data privacy said in a statement.  Jennifer Addo, 27, found out how many children the customer
had and gave details to his then partner, the Information
Commissioner’s Office said. Addo appeared at Croydon Magistrates
Court today charged with 23 offenses under the data protection
act.  She was fired by Barclays after the complaint was made,
according to the ICO statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
