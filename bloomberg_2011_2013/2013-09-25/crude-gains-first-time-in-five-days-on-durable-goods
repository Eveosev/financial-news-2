West Texas Intermediate crude fell
to a 12-week low as inventories unexpectedly rose last week and
demand slipped.  Prices slid for a fifth day after the Energy Information
Administration reported stockpiles  increased  2.64 million
barrels. Analysts had forecast a 1 million-barrel decrease.
Gasoline consumption declined 2 percent to 8.85 million barrels
a day. WTI also followed losses in equities on concern that
lawmakers won’t reach a deal to avoid a government shutdown.  “The build in crude is surprising and demand is coming
down,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund
manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. “It’s a very bearish report.
I wouldn’t be surprised to see prices get down to $100 by the
end of the week.”  WTI crude for November delivery slipped 47 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $102.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest settlement since July 3. Futures have
retreated 5 percent in the past five days, the longest run of
declines since Dec. 10. The volume of all futures traded was 13
percent below the 100-day average at 3:37 p.m. Prices are up 6.3
percent this quarter and 12 percent in 2013.  Brent for November settlement fell 32 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $108.32 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume was 25 percent above the 100-day
average. The European benchmark’s premium to WTI grew 15 cents
to $5.66, the widest level since Sept. 5.  U.S. Inventories  Crude supplies climbed for the first time in four weeks,
according to data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm. They rebounded to 358.3 million barrels from
355.6 million the prior week, the least since March 2012.  Total petroleum demand fell 2.8 percent to 19.3 million
barrels a day. Refineries reduced their utilization rate to 90.3
percent, the lowest level since Aug. 9.  “The big story is the big drop in refinery utilization,”
said Jacob Correll, a Louisville, Kentucky-based commodity
analyst at energy management firm Schneider Electric
Professional Services. “If utilization had been higher, we
would have seen big draws.”  Crude inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , WTI’s delivery
point, slipped 412,000 barrels to 32.8 million on Sept. 20, the
lowest level since February 2012, the report showed. Supplies
have tumbled 34 percent since June 28 and dropped for 12 weeks.  Budget Talks  WTI also fell as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped
for a fifth day. The Senate, by unanimous vote today, advanced a
House stopgap spending measure as a federal government shutdown
looms. Before sending the bill back to the House, Senate
Democrats plan to strip language from the House version that
would choke off funding for the 2010 health-care law.  Unless an agreement is reached to expedite Senate
consideration of the measure, a vote on passage could occur as
late as Sept. 29. That would give the House just one full
workday to act before spending authority expires.  Brent, the European benchmark, declined less than WTI as
 Iran ’s President Hassan Rohani rebuffed President  Barack Obama ’s
attempt at direct engagement in the United Nations yesterday.  “The Iranian president was not as conciliatory as people
had expected,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “The
build is making WTI weaker than Brent.”  Iran Overtures  Obama told world leaders yesterday in New York that he
welcomed overtures from Rohani and the prospect of resolving a
decades-long confrontation. Iranian officials told their U.S.
counterparts that the time wasn’t yet right for even a handshake
between the two leaders.  Rohani offered softer rhetoric yesterday in his speech at
the UN without conceding his country’s right to nuclear power.  Iran has the world’s fourth-largest proven oil reserves
after  Venezuela , Saudi Arabia and  Canada , according to the BP
statistical review. Sanctions aimed at stopping the Islamic
republic’s nuclear program have hindered its oil exports.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
November was 21.2 percent, little changed from yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 480,624
contracts as of 3:37 p.m. It totaled 552,340 contracts
yesterday, 12 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.88 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
