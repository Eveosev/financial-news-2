Indonesia  will probably refrain
from fully banning mineral ore exports in 2014 as the move would
spur unemployment in the producing regions, said Jim Lennon,
commodities consultant to Macquarie Group Ltd.  “I don’t expect Indonesia will fully ban ore exports next
year,” said Lennon at the Metal Bulletin Asian Nickel
Conference in Jakarta today. “They will have to work out a
political compromise.”  Indonesia is seeking to increase the value of commodity
exports and strengthen control over pricing. While the country
plans to ban exports of ores, including nickel and bauxite, the
government is studying some exemptions for mining companies that
already have smelters or are planning to build them. The chances
that Indonesia will ban ore sales are 50-50, according to
Glencore Xstrata Plc.  “Ahead of elections in April 2014, it’s hard to imagine
the government creating mass unemployment in Sulawesi and
Kalimantan,” Lennon said, referring to the country’s top
producers of nickel and bauxite.  Nickel, used in stainless steel, has slumped 19 percent
this year as stockpiles rose to an all-time high because of
rising supplies and weak demand. Inventories in warehouses
monitored by the London Metal Exchange rose 4.7 percent to
222,012 tons this month, bourse data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
