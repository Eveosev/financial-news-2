Robusta coffee fell in London to
the lowest since January as bearish technical indicators added
to speculation supplies are ample in  Vietnam , the world’s
biggest grower of the variety, and  Indonesia . Sugar rose.  The 2013-14 harvest in Indonesia, the third-ranking robusta
grower, started this month and will rise to 11 million 60-
kilogram (132-pound) bags, according to estimates by  Andrea Thompson , the Belfast, Northern Ireland-based head of research
and analysis at CoffeeNetwork, a unit of broker INTL FCStone
Inc. That compares with 10 million bags a year earlier.  “Recent losses were primarily a technical move, purely
because we have been confined in the $2,000 to $2,100-a-metric-
ton range, but the market was unable to break up through the
top,” Thompson said by phone today. “Fundamentally, what has
been limiting the upside is ample supply.”  Robusta futures for delivery in July retreated 0.5 percent
to $1,975 a ton by 11:20 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Prices
touched $1,973, the lowest since Jan. 31. Arabica coffee futures
for the same delivery month gained 0.1 percent to $1.3755 a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  “Robusta fundamentals have turned more bearish recently,”
ADM Investor Services International said in a report dated April
19 and posted on its website yesterday. Rains arrived in
Vietnam, which had faced dry conditions, and “opinions have
changed dramatically with some analysts now believing production
could be a record.”  Vietnam’s crop will be 25 million to 26 million bags in the
2012-13 season begun in October, according to CoffeeNetwork.
That is down from 27 million bags a year earlier, Thompson said.
The estimate might be revised depending on exports in the next
few months, she said. Volcafe, a unit of commodities trader ED&F
Man Holdings Ltd., in February estimated Vietnam’s crop at 26.5
million bags.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August added 0.6
percent to $501.50 a ton in  London . Raw sugar for delivery in
July rose 0.3 percent to 17.44 cents a pound in New York.  Cocoa for delivery in July declined 0.6 percent to 1,546
pounds ($2,388) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for the same delivery
month slid 0.3 percent to $2,354 a ton on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
