Rubber was poised for a weekly
advance after oil jumped to a two-week high, raising speculation
prices may increase for rival synthetic products used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in October advanced as much as 2.6
percent to 265.8 yen a kilogram ($2,679 a metric ton), the
highest level for a most-active contract since April 15. Futures
traded at 263 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:54 a.m.
and gained 3.9 percent this week, the first in two weeks.  West Texas Intermediate crude traded at $93.39 a barrel
after surging 2.4 percent yesterday to the highest settlement
since April 10. Speculation grew that the European Central Bank
will cut its key interest rate to a record low, increasing
investor appetite for riskier assets, said  Kazuhiko Saito ,
analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  “Rubber chased a rally in oil and other industrial
commodities amid speculation that monetary easing from  Japan  to
 Europe  will support a global recovery,” he said today by phone.  Banks including Nomura International Plc, UBS AG and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc are forecasting that the ECB will
drop its main refinancing rate to 0.5 percent at a meeting on
May 2 after gauges of European manufacturing and services for
April showed weakness. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan
and the Bank of England have also purchased bonds and cut rates
to stimulate growth.  Rubber for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 2.3 percent to 19,565  yuan  ($3,171) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained for a fourth day yesterday, rising
0.9 percent to 82.55 baht ($2.81) a kilogram, according to
Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
