E.CL SA (ECL) , northern Chile’s largest
power generator, rose the most in 19 months after its first-
quarter profit beat some analysts’ estimates.  E.CL advanced 4 percent to 970 pesos at 3:36 p.m. in
Santiago after gaining 5.1 percent, the biggest intraday
increase since September 2011. The Ipsa index fell 0.6 percent.  The power generator, a unit of  France ’s  GDF Suez (GSZ) , reported
yesterday after the close of markets earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of $66.8 million, down from
$88 million a year earlier. Banco Santander SA had a forecast of
$60.9 million while Larrain Vial SA projected $63.1 million.  “Without a doubt the figures were a surprise,” Rodolfo Tapia, an analyst at Banco Penta, said in a telephone interview
from Santiago. “It beat estimates even with the suspension in
the quarter of two of its most efficient power plants.”  E.CL temporarily halted in January operations at two of its
plants because of technical malfunctions: Central Termoelectrica
Andina and Central Termoelectrica Hornitos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
