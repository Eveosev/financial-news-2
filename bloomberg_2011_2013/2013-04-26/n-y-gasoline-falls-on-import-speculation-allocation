New York  gasoline weakened versus
futures as the flow of imports from  Europe  was expected to climb
and as Colonial Pipeline Co. allocated shipments on its main
gasoline line.  Traders will charter a total of 34 Medium Range tankers to
transport gasoline for loading by May 7, according to the median
in a survey of seven shipbrokers and traders. That’s up from 18
vessels, each normally carrying 37,000 metric tons of cargo, in
the previous survey.  Colonial allocated shipments on the 1.5 million-barrel-a-
day Line 01, which carries gasoline from Houston to Greensboro,
 North Carolina . Colonial allocates shipments when the line’s
maximum capacity is exceeded.  The  premium  for reformulated, 91-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in New York Harbor narrowed 0.25 cent to 17.75 cents a gallon
versus futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:14 p.m.
Conventional, 87-octane gasoline slid 0.87 cents to a discount
of 9.50 cents a gallon below futures.  An increase in imports from Europe, along with the maximum
amount of barrels being sent from the  Gulf Coast  to the U.S.
East Coast, may lead to a boost in area supplies already
hovering at a 14-year seasonal high.  East Coast stockpiles  gained 570,000 barrels to 60.6
million in the week ended April 19, according to U.S. Energy
Information Administration data. Imports to the area rose 11,000
barrels to 592,000 last week.  “Imports have been up and are going to continue to go
up,” Tom Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group Ltd., said
in a phone interview from Jupiter,  Florida . “We’ll probably see
them rise by about 50,000 or 60,000 barrels next week based on
the shipping survey.”  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York Harbor rose 32 cents to
$16.44, the highest level since November, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
