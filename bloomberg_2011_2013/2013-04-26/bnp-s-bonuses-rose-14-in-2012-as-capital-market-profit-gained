BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ,  France ’s largest
bank, increased its bonus pool by 14 percent last year after
profit from the capital-markets business rose.  BNP Paribas paid 559 million euros ($729 million) in
bonuses to 3,252 employees in 2012, mostly to professionals at
its corporate and investment bank, the Paris-based company said
in a  report  on its website. The cash bonus pool was 188 million
euros, 41 percent higher than a year earlier, according to data
on the website.  Operating profit at BNP’s advisory and capital-market
business, home of its trading activity, rose 18 percent in 2012
from a year before, the firm reiterated. The total bonus pool
for 2012 remains 45 percent below its 2010 level, the bank said.  The average 2012 bonus for BNP’s corporate- and investment-
banking professionals, whose activity can have an impact on the
company’s “risk profile,” was about 166,800 euros, compared
with 136,000 euros a year earlier, according to calculations
based on the lender’s data.
