Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  failed to
block a U.K. Competition Commission investigation into its 30
percent stake in  Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL)  after Britain’s highest
court refused to hear an appeal.  The U.K. Supreme Court in  London  refused to review a lower
court’s decision to allow the investigation to go ahead because
it would not “raise an arguable point of law of general public
importance,” the court said in an e-mailed statement today.  Ryanair has been fighting with regulators since acquiring
the Aer Lingus shares in 2006 as part of an earlier takeover bid
that the European Union ultimately blocked on competition
grounds. The European Commission blocked a bid for a second time
this year after regulators decided it would increase fares and
reduce choice on flights from Ireland.  “The European legal principle is clear, and its
application fact-specific,” the  supreme court  said.  Ryanair lost a bid to block the U.K. competition review of
its Aer Lingus stake in the court of appeal in December.  Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said the company doesn’t
comment on pending litigation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
