Stanbic IBTC Holding Co. (STANBIC) , the
Nigerian unit of  South Africa ’s  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , plans
to raise $150 million in new capital this year, Chief Executive
Officer Sola David-Borha said.  The bank plans to use the Tier 2 capital for investments in
infrastructure and lending, David-Borha said on a conference
call today from Lagos, the commercial capital, without giving
further details.  “Loans and advances are planned to grow by 15 percent by
end-2013, from 6 percent in 2012,” she said.  Nigerian banks are returning to profitability after Central
Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi fired the CEOs of eight
of the country’s 24 banks in 2009 and gave them a 620 billion-
naira ($3.9 billion) bailout after lending to equity speculators
and fuel importers pushed the industry near collapse. The
government then set up the Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria  to
buy bad debts from the banks.  Stanbic’s net income for the three months through March
rose to 3.6 billion naira from 2.5 billion naira a year earlier,
it said April 19. Revenue climbed to 26.6 billion naira from
20.4 billion naira. The lender is seeking to boost its deposit
base by 25 percent this year, David-Borha said.  The bank’s shares rose for a fifth day climbing by 0.8
percent to 13.36 naira at the close in Lagos. The stock has
advanced 21 percent this year, compared with a 14 percent gain
in the Bloomberg Nigerian Stock Exchange Banking 10 Index, which
tracks the country’s largest lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
