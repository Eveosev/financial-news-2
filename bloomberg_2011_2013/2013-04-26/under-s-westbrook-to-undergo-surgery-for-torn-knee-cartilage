Oklahoma City Thunder guard  Russell
Westbrook  will undergo surgery after tearing cartilage in his
right knee during a playoff game two days ago.  Westbrook, the sixth leading scorer in the National
Baskerball Association with a 23.2 points per game average, tore
his lateral meniscus in the second quarter of the game against
the Houston Rockets. The Thunder in a statement didn’t disclose
how much time Westbrook would miss.  Oklahoma City leads the best-of-seven series two games to
none. Game three is tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
