Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the largest
independent merger-advisory firm, reported first-quarter profit
that missed analysts’ estimates as revenue declined.  Net income fell 40 percent to $15.4 million, or 12 cents a
share, from $25.6 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier, the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said today in a statement.
Adjusted earnings, which exclude some items, were 28 cents a
share, compared with the 31-cent  average estimate  of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The firm boosted its quarterly dividend
25 percent to 25 cents per share.  Lazard Chief Executive Officer Ken Jacobs, 54, told
investors in February that the next few months will determine
whether a shift in corporate sentiment leads to an upturn in
dealmaking amid improving valuations and available financing.
Global merger-and-acquisition volume declined 1.5 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier, following a year in which
total dollar volume dropped for the first time since 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Advisory had a soft quarter,” Jacobs said in a phone
interview following the results. “It’s reflective of the
volatility in the markets six to nine months ago because there’s
a lag between announcements and closings.”  Financial-advisory revenue fell 39 percent to $168 million
from a year earlier, according to the statement. That was partly
because some transactions closed in the fourth quarter, when
global M&A volume was the highest since the third period of
2008, instead of in the first quarter, Jacobs said.  Cost Cutting  “We had an acceleration of closings into the fourth
quarter in middle market and probably a few more than we
expected in some of the large stuff,” he said.  Rising equity markets boosted first-quarter asset
management revenue, which increased 14 percent to $240 million,
Jacobs said. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained 10 percent
in the period.  Lazard’s operating revenue declined 17 percent to $414
million from a year earlier, according to the statement. The
company set aside $248 million, or 60 percent of revenue, for
compensation in the period, compared with $313 million, or 63
percent, a year earlier.  Last year, Lazard announced a cost-cutting plan targeting
$125 million in annual savings. That led to about $26 million in
implementation expenses in the first quarter, according to the
statement. The “bulk” of the initiatives are complete, Chief
Operating Officer Alex Stern said today in an interview.  As Lazard implemented those cost reductions, the company
found another $10 million to $20 million to cut as well, Stern
said.  Lazard rose 14 cents, or 0.4 percent, to close at $33.30 in
New York. The shares have climbed 12 percent this year, compared
with the 13 percent gain of the Russell 1000 Financial Services
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
