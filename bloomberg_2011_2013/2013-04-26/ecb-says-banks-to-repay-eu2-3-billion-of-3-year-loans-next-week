The  European Central Bank  said
banks will repay 2.3 billion euros ($3 billion) of three-year
loans next week.  Five banks will return 1.7 billion euros borrowed in the
first of the so-called Longer Term Refinancing Operations, and
six will repay 615 million euros of the second tender, the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today. That takes the
total amount of money repaid early to 276.8 billion euros, or 27
percent of the amount lent.  The ECB flooded financial markets with three-year loans
totaling more than 1 trillion euros a year ago after banks
stopped lending to each other because of  Europe ’s debt crisis.
Banks have the option of repaying the funds, which were offered
at the average of the ECB’s benchmark rate over their duration,
after a year.  With doubts growing about an economic recovery later this
year, ECB policy makers have signaled they are looking at a
range of measures to boost growth, including an interest-rate
cut and more long-term loans.  “So far we haven’t seen any improvement in the situation”
since the last rate decision on April 4, ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on April 19. The Frankfurt-based central bank in
March cut its forecasts and now predicts the 17-nation euro
economy will shrink 0.5 percent this year before growing 1
percent in 2014.  The ECB still allows banks to borrow as much money as they
want against eligible collateral for periods of one week, one
month and three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
