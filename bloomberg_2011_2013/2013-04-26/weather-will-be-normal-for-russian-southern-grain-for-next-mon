Weather in southern  Russia  will be
about normal next week, signaling a low risk for crop
development at the start of May, a critical period for grain
growth, according to the country’s weather service.  In May, winter wheat begins flowering in  southern Russia
and North-Caucasus , according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service.  The Southern and North-Caucasus federal districts will have
a normal amount of rain from today until May 5, according to a
preliminary forecast, Anna Strashnaya, head of the agriculture
forecasts department of Russia’s weather service, said by phone
in Moscow today. Temperatures will range from 16 degrees Celsius
(61 degrees Fahrenheit) to 19 degrees Celsius in the areas,
which is above average but not enough to damage the plants, she
said.  Temperatures will be 1 degree Celsius to 4 degrees Celsius
above the norm in the Southern district and 2 degrees Celsius to
4 degrees Celsius above the norm in the North-Caucasus district,
she said.  The two districts accounted for about 35 percent of the
national crop after about 24.6 million metric tons was harvested
in the season that ends June 30, according to the Federal State
Statistics data.  It’s important for the grain to have normal weather and
moisture in May to boost growth, Oleg Sukhanov, grain analyst at
the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies, said by phone
today.  “If there are no rains in May crops will weaken, and any
precipitation in June won’t improve the situation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
