Natural gas futures may drop next
week as moderating weather reduces demand for the heating and
power-plant fuel, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Eleven of 15 analysts, or 73 percent, forecast that futures
will decline on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through May 3
26. Three, or 20 percent, said gas will advance and one
predicted prices will stay the same. Last week, 64 percent of
participants said gas would fall.  Temperatures will be seasonal across most of the East Coast
and the Midwest next week with a streak of below-normal readings
in  Texas  and other central states, according to MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Gas this week is heading for
its first decline in 10 weeks on milder weather, after an
unusually cold start to spring buoyed fuel demand.  “Traders are seeing the writing on the wall and can see
spring weather on the horizon,” Aaron Calder, senior market
analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston, said in a note to
clients yesterday.  Natural gas futures for May delivery fell 24.1 cents, or
5.5 percent, to $4.167 per million Btu during the first four
days of this week in New York. Prices have climbed 24 percent
this year.  The low in  New York City  on April 30 will be 52 degrees
Fahrenheit (11 Celsius), 3 above normal, after dropping to 6
lower than average on April 23 at 41 degrees, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in
 Chicago  on April 30 will be 10 above normal at 57 degrees.  Supply Report  Gas stockpiles  rose 30 billion cubic feet to 1.734 trillion
cubic feet in the week ended April 19, below the five-year
average gain of 50 billion, the Energy Information
Administration reported yesterday.  Analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg showed an expected increase of 33 billion.  A  supply deficit  versus the historic norm widened to 5.1
percent from 4.2 percent in the seven days ended April 12, the
most February 2011, EIA data show.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 50 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  3      11     1  To contact the reporter on this story:
