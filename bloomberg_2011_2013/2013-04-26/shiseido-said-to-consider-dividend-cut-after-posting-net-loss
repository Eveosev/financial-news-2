Shiseido Co. (4911) ,  Asia ’s biggest
cosmetics maker, reduced its planned dividend 60 percent and
pledged cost cuts to recover from the first annual loss in eight
years. Its shares slid the most in two years.  The dividend will probably be 20 yen a share for the year
ending March 2014, from 50 yen in the previous period, the
Tokyo-based company said in a statement today. It’s the first
dividend cut since Shiseido listed, Chief Financial Officer
Yoshinori Nishimura said at a briefing.  Shiseido pledged to reduce  spending  including cuts in
executive pay after its push into the U.S. with the $1.7 billion
purchase of Bare Escentuals in 2010 left it with a 28.6 billion
yen ($290 million) loss on goodwill last fiscal year. The maker
of women’s cosmetics and toiletries had sought growth outside
 Japan , where a shrinking  population  and stagnant wages have
sapped demand.  “It’s understandable and makes sense that they cut
dividend for growth  investment , but they should have done it
earlier -- what’s negative is that they had to do it this
late,” said Wakako Sato, analyst at Mizuho Securities Co. The
company’s payout ratio “was not sustainable,” said Sato, who
has a neutral rating on the stock.  Margin Narrows  Shiseido  fell  8.3 percent to 1,390 yen, the most since
March 15, 2011, after earlier heading for the biggest decline in
more than four years.  Sales fell 0.7 percent to 677.7 billion yen in the year
ended in March, the company reported today. The drop is the
third annual decline over five years.  Net  loss  was 14.7 billion yen in the year ended March 2013,
the first deficit since 2005, the company reported April 24 on a
preliminary basis.  Shiseido had planned for Bare Escentuals, maker of the
bareMinerals brand, to be the “base for future growth” and
widen its operating profit margin to about 9 percent. It has
instead narrowed to 3.84 percent, from 7.26 percent in 2010.  Bare Escentuals’ “sales have remained lower than
expected,” Shiseido said in an April 24 preliminary earnings
 statement . “Bare Escentuals has taken longer than initially
envisioned to grow its retail business,” the company said.
“The gap between its sales budget and sales performance has
been widening during recent months.”  Shiseido last year announced a reorganization of the U.S.
business, which included merging back office functions between
its subsidiaries and Bare Escentuals.  Bloomberg News  reported earlier today that Shiseido was
considering cutting the payment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
