Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer, hired  Standard Life Plc (SL/)  Chief Financial Officer Jackie Hunt to run its U.K. and Europe division.  Hunt, 44, replaces Rob Devey, who will leave the company in
October, Prudential said today in a statement. She could earn
more than 3 million pounds ($4.6 million) in salary, bonus and
long-term incentives, Prudential said. Standard Life, Scotland’s
biggest insurer, is yet to appoint a replacement for Hunt, the
Edinburgh-based company said in a separate statement.  “Jackie joins Prudential with a proven track record of
delivery in the highly competitive U.K. insurance market,”
Prudential Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam said in the
statement. “I am delighted that a person of her talent and
experience is joining the group.”  London-based Prudential earned about 24 percent of its
operating profit from the U.K.  last year , while the bulk of its
income comes from  Asia . Thiam was reprimanded by the Financial
Services Authority last month for failing to notify the
regulator of his planned bid for Asian insurer  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  in
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
