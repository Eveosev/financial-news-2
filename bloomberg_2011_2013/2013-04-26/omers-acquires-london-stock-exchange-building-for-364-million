Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System’s real estate unit bought the London Stock
Exchange’s headquarters from  Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802)  for 235
million pounds ($364 million).  The price paid by Omers’ Oxford Properties for the building
at 10 Paternoster Square reflects an initial yield of 5.3
percent, Toronto-based Oxford said in a statement today. The
London Stock Exchange’s lease for the property in the city’s
main financial district runs out in 2028, according to the
statement. Other tenants include  Portugal ’s Grupo Banco Espirito
Santo and Numis Securities.  “The prime City core location of Paternoster Square,
coupled with the strength of LSE’s lease covenant, will deliver
secure risk-adjusted returns,” Oxford Senior Managing Director
Paul Brundage said in the statement.  Foreign investors accounted for 88 percent of the property
deals completed in the City of  London  and Canary Wharf banking
districts in the first quarter, according to data compiled by
broker Cushman & Wakefield Inc., as pension and sovereign wealth
funds seek out long-term secure income.  The property at Paternoster Square has 246,000 square feet
(22,850 square meters) of space, Oxford said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
