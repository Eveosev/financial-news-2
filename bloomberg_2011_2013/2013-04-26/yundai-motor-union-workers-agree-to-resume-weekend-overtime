Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  union workers in
 South Korea  agreed to restart weekend shifts, ending a seven-
week dispute that the company estimates cost 950 billion won
($854 million) in lost production.  Hyundai Motor Workers Union  and the automaker have agreed
to restart weekend overtime from next weekend, South Korea’s
largest carmaker said in an e-mail. Union employees, demanding
higher compensation, had refused to work overtime on weekends
since March and the company estimates that cost lost production
of 48,000 units, it said.  The agreement helps ease headwinds at the automaker, which
is struggling with the won’s 25 percent gain against the yen in
the past year. Hyundai yesterday reported first-quarter profit
fell 15 percent to 2.09 trillion.  The Seoul-based company will pay 225,000 won on average per
employee who works the weekend shifts that run for eight hours
and nine hours, respectively, the company said. The new shifts,
which are three hours longer than in the previous system, will
increase productivity by 46 percent to build 6,900 units per
day, according to Hyundai.  Hyundai and its union will make up the lost production with
the new weekend shifts, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
