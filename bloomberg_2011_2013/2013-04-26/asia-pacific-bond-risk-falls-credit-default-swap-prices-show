The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 1.5 basis points to
109.5 basis points as of 10:59 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The gauge is on course for its lowest
close since March 19, according to data provider CMA. Markets in
Australia were closed yesterday for a public holiday.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  retreated 1 to 111 as of 8:25 a.m. in
 Hong Kong ,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  prices show. The
benchmark is also set for its lowest close since March 19,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 86
basis points as of 9:36 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The last time the measure closed lower was in April 2010,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
