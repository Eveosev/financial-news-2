The shekel strengthened to an 18-
month high versus the dollar prompting speculation that the  Bank
of Israel  will step up dollar purchases to weaken the currency.  The shekel appreciated less than 0.1 percent to 3.6048 per
dollar, the highest level since October 2011. The Bank of Israel
said in a statement April 8, when the shekel rallied to as much
as 3.5898 per dollar, that it had “acted” in the  currency
market .  Israel’s currency has been strengthening on prospects
production of natural gas off the nation’s coast and government
reforms will stoke economic growth. The shekel has climbed 3.6
percent against the greenback this year, the biggest advance
among 13 Middle eastern currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
intervention April 8 was the first time the central bank had
bought dollars to arrest shekel gains since July 2011.  “The shekel was at new lows back in early April before the
central bank intervention drove it down,”  Win Thin , global head
of  emerging markets  strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in
 New York , said by e-mail. “Now that we are testing those level
again, I would expect more intervention.”  Israel’s economy will expand 3.4 percent this year after
growing 3.2 percent in 2012, according to the median of 14
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The shekel is the
best performer over the past six months of a basket of 31 major
currencies compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
