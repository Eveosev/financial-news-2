The collection of Judaica assembled
over the past three decade by philanthropist and former hedge-fund manager Michael Steinhardt and his wife, Judy, is heading
to the auction block next week in New York.  “I am not trying to get rich from the sale,” said
Steinhardt, 72, in a telephone interview. “I keep getting
second thoughts. Why am I doing this? The truth is I’ve
collected in three or four areas, at least. The Judaica
collection was in my office and no one in my family was
particularly interested in it. It was isolated from the rest of
my life.”  The sale’s 386 lots encompass seven centuries of domestic,
ceremonial and religious aspects of Jewish culture and come from
all over the globe. The auction is expected to bring more than
$11 million on April 29 at Sotheby’s.  The items are on view through Sunday. There are brass
charity boxes that started the Steinhardt collection in the
early 1980s, embroidered textiles, medieval manuscripts, silver
Sabbath lamps and even a small blue-velvet-and-sable-tail hat,
large enough for a Hasidic boy. Many items are estimated at less
than $10,000.  Here are some highlights:  Mishneh Torah  The most valuable piece is a 15th-century, illustrated
volume of Mishneh Torah, the code of Jewish law assembled by
Maimonides. The first volume of this work is in the Vatican
collection. It’s estimated at $4.5 million to $6 million.  A scarlet, 1861 Torah ark curtain from Calcutta with a
silver dedicatory plaque has a $5,000 to $7,000 estimate.  A piece by Odessa master Israel Rouchomovsky has a
perfectly articulated 3-inch gold skeleton on a silver-gilt
coffin. He smuggled it in his pocket to the Salon Exhibition of
Decorative Arts in Paris in 1903, winning a gold medal. The
estimate: $150,000 to $250,000.  An 1804 gouache depicting a bustling Jewish market in
 Prague  by George Emanuel Opiz is estimated at $30,000 to
$50,000.  An elaborate 1716 marriage contract, or Ketubbah, from
 Venice  could fetch $50,000 to $70,000. The ornate document
features the two families’ coats of arms, 12 zodiac signs and
figures of Aaron and Moses.  An 18th-century parcel-gilt and silver Torah shield from
 Poland  has images of cranes, monkeys and squirrels and is dotted
with colorful gems. The estimate: $40,000 to $60,000.  Abraham bar Jacob, the creator of engravings in the 1695
Amsterdam Haggadah, is represented by a work depicting Adam and
Eve in the Garden of Eden. It is estimated at $8,000 to $12,000.  Muse highlights include Lewis Lapham’s  podcast  and Jeremy
