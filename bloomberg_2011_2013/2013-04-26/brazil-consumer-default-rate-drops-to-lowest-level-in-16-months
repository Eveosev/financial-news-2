Brazil’s consumer-loan default rate
fell to the lowest level since November 2011 on near-record low
borrowing costs.  The consumer default rate fell for a third consecutive
month to 7.6 percent from 7.7 percent in February, the central
bank said in a report distributed today in Brasilia. The company
loan default rate fell to 3.6% from 3.7 percent.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has lowered
 reserve requirements  and pressured commercial banks to reduce
 interest rates  as a means to boost lending and aid economic
recovery in the world’s largest emerging market after  China .
After March inflation climbed above the upper limit of the
government’s target range, the central bank raised its key rate
to 7.5 percent from a record low 7.25 percent, where it had
remained since October.  Brazil’s average rate on loans fell to 26.1 percent in
March from 26.5 percent in February. Average rate on consumer
loans fell to 34.5 percent from 35.1 percent a month earlier.  Outstanding credit rose 1.8 percent in March from February
to 2.43 trillion reais ($1.2 trillion), the central bank said
today.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose 2 basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 7.95 percent at 10:40 a.m. local time. The
real rose 0.04 percent to 2.0004 per  U.S. dollar .  Brazil’s inflation accelerated for nine straight months
through March, reaching 6.59 percent. A week after the
government’s statistics institute reported the data, the central
bank’s monetary policy committee, known as Copom,  raised its
benchmark rate for the first time since July 2011. The
government targets annual inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points.  “I have a growing conviction that the Copom may be
prompted to reflect on the possibility of intensifying the use
of its monetary policy tool, the Selic rate,” Carlos Hamilton,
the bank’s director of monetary policy, said yesterday at an
event in Sao Paulo. Swap rates rose after his comments.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand by 3 percent
this year, according to the latest central bank survey of about
100 economists.  Latin America ’s largest economy grew by 0.9
percent last year, its second-worst performance in 13 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
