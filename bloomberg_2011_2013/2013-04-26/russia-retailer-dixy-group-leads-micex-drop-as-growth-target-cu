OAO Dixy Group,  Russia ’s third-
largest food retailer, led declines on the benchmark stock index
after profit missed analyst estimates and the company cut its
2013 expansion plan.  Dixy fell as much as 5.2 percent, the most in a week, and
traded down 3.1 percent at 390.50 rubles at 3:45 p.m. in Moscow.
Russian benchmark Micex index slipped 0.1 percent.  Billionaire Igor Kesaev’s Dixy  reported  a 1.4 percent
decline in fourth-quarter earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to 2.22 billion rubles ($71
million), while its Ebitda margin slid to 5.5 percent from 6.6
percent a year earlier. Dixy will open 380 new stores this year
compared with an earlier target of 400 and may boost sales 25
percent versus a range of 25 percent to 28 percent guided
previously, according to the company’s press service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
