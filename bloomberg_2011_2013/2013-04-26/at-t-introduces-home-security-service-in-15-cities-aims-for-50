AT&T Inc. (T)  is starting its home
monitoring and security service today in 15 cities, one of the
biggest attempts yet by the largest U.S. telephone company to
find growth outside its slowing wireless and landline business.  AT&T’s Digital Life service starts at $29.99 a month for
basic sensor and alarm security, plus $149.99 for installation.
Higher-priced packages include remote camera monitoring,
thermostat and lighting control, as well as door locking.  The Dallas-based company joins  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 
and Comcast Corp. in entering the so-called smart-home market,
where wireless sensors and cameras can be managed through
Internet-connected devices. The service will be sold through
AT&T Wireless stores in as many as 50 cities by year-end and
takes aim at home security leader  ADT Corp. (ADT)   “We’re jumping ahead of the competition by years in terms
of technology at a competitive price,” said  Glenn Lurie , AT&T
president of emerging devices.  AT&T announced Digital Life home security a year ago and
has been conducting trials of it with employees. The challenge
for AT&T will be to offer the service without sacrificing profit
margins. Two days ago, AT&T shares dropped 5 percent after the
company reported disappointing sales and continued challenges as
it tries to catch up with Verizon Wireless in subscriber growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
