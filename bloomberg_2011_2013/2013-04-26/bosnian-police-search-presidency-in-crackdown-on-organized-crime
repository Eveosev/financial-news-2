Bosnia’s state security agency
questioned top government officials and searched their offices
today in simultaneous probes of alleged corruption, drug
smuggling and organized crime, the authorities said.  The  Prosecutor’s Office  of Bosnia-Herzegovina  said  it
authorized the  State Investigation and Protection Agency , or
SIPA, to carry out “investigative activities” at the offices
of Bosnia’s Presidency in the capital, Sarajevo, and at the seat
of the Muslim-Croat Federation in Mostar. Bosnia-Herzegovina
consists of the Federation and a Serb entity, known as Republika
Srpska.  The investigation focused on Federation President Zivko
Budimir and his alleged role in “cash-for-pardon” cases, state
broadcaster  BHRT1  reported. Budimir’s office declined to
comment.  SIPA  said  it was focusing on “tens of persons” involved
in corruption, abuse of office, drug trafficking and organized
crime and that “searches are ongoing at many locations.”  “The aim of these investigative activities is to discover
corruption offenses whose perpetrators are the highest
officials,” the prosecutor’s office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
