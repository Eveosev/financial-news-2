Embraer SA (EMBR3)  fell to a one-week low
after Citigroup Inc. advised selling the Brazilian planemaker’s
stock on the potential for margins and revenue to trail
analysts’ estimates.  The shares slumped 3.5 percent to 16.31 reais at 1:05 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo , set for the lowest closing level since April 17.
It was the worst performer on the MSCI  Brazil /Industrials Index,
which fell 1.4 percent.  Citigroup analysts including Stephen Trent cut their rating
on Embraer to sell from the equivalent of hold, citing the
planemaker’s high valuation versus global aerospace peers as its
backlog of orders declines. The Sao Jose dos Campos-based
company’s firm order backlogs totaled 211 planes in the first
quarter, below the 240 planes of a year earlier.  “Embraer is the only member of the group that has seen
large, multi-year backlog declines and is alone in guiding
towards lower 2013 commercial aircraft deliveries,” the
analysts wrote in a research note. “While commercial jet,
KC-390 and other order flow is likely, providing short-term
trading opportunities, margins and revenue generation could
disappoint as backlog quality declines.”  The planemaker has gained 13 percent this year, while
Brazil’s Ibovespa stock benchmark fell 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
