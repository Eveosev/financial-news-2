Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. (2318) ,
 China ’s second-biggest insurer, said first-quarter profit rose
22 percent on higher investment returns and increased revenue
from banking operations.  Net income  climbed to 7.39 billion  yuan  ($1.2 billion) from
6.06 billion yuan a year earlier, the company said in a Hong
Kong stock exchange filing yesterday. Net premiums earned rose
14 percent to 77.3 billion yuan and investment income, mainly
interest and dividends, “grew steadily,” Shenzhen-based Ping
An said.  Ping An joins bigger  China Life (2628)  Insurance Co. in reporting
higher profits on improved performance of investments after
absorbing losses last year amid weak equity markets. Ping An
Bank Co., a unit, reported a 4.7 percent increase in profit.  “Ping An’s profit expansion this year should look fairly
good after last year’s impairment losses,” said Xie Jiyong, a
Shanghai-based analyst at  Capital Securities Corp. (6005)  “Banking
profit growth would probably slow down” as last year’s
interest-rate cuts erode margins.  Ping An’s investment losses jumped almost 10-fold to 9.5
billion yuan last year and impairment losses more than doubled,
the company said last month.  China Life reported on April 25 a 79 percent jump in profit
for the first quarter as investment returns increased and
impairments dropped 89 percent. Smaller China Pacific Insurance
Group Co. on April 24 reported a 241 percent jump in net income
for the same period.  Ping An rose 0.9 percent to close at HK$60.15 in Hong Kong
trading yesterday, before publishing earnings, trimming this
year’s decline to 7.3 percent. China Life gained 1.5 percent to
HK$20.90.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
