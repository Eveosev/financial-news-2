The National Football League, whose
Super Bowl championship game will be played in New Jersey next
year, will provide $2 million to rebuild youth playgrounds and
gyms damaged by  Hurricane Sandy , to help fight obesity in kids.  Governor Chris Christie, a New Jersey Republican
campaigning for re-election this year, and NFL Commissioner
Roger Goodell announced the plan yesterday at a Boys and Girls
Club in Hoboken that Sandy damaged last year. A new wooden gym
floor, financed by the league, displays logos for the NFL Play
60 youth-activity program as well as the next Super Bowl.  Christie said no decisions have been made on where to
direct the money.  “I will certainly make suggestions,” the governor told
reporters as he signed autographs and posed for pictures with
children. “There will be enough money to go around and help a
lot of worthy causes. That’s one of the great things about the
Super Bowl.”  The funds will be distributed by the league’s Snowflake
Youth Foundation, according to the NFL. Christie and Goodell
were joined by  New York  Jets owner Woody Johnson and John Mara,
the New York Giants chief executive officer, as well as a number
of players and league officials.  The Play 60 program encourages children to engage in an
hour of play each day to combat obesity.  Sandy crashed ashore in New Jersey on Oct. 29, knocking out
power to 2.7 million customers, devastating coastal towns and
crippling mass transit. Christie, 50, has said it will cost
$36.9 billion to rebuild and prevent future devastation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
