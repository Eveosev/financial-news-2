LivingSocial Inc., a daily deal coupons site, said that more than 50 million customers may have been affected by a cyberattack, and the company is working with law enforcement to investigate the matter.  LivingSocial is communicating with customers whose data may have been breached, the Washington-based company said in an e- mailed statement today. That includes clients in every country where LivingSocial operates, except South Korea,  Thailand ,  Indonesia  and the  Philippines , which use different systems, the company said.  Chief Executive Officer Tim O’Shaughnessy sent an e-mail to LivingSocial employees informing them of that attack on its computer systems, which resulted in customer data being compromised. While data that was accessed includes names, e-mail addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, credit-card information was not accessed, O’Shaughnessy wrote.  In the e-mail to customers, LivingSocial is recommending that affected users create a new password, and if they use the same password on other sites, to change it accordingly.
