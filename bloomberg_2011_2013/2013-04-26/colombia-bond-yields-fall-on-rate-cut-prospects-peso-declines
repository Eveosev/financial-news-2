Colombia ’s peso bond yields dropped
on speculation the central bank will lower borrowing costs today
for a sixth consecutive month.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark bonds due in July 2024
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.84 percent
at 9:38 a.m. in Bogota, according to the central bank. The
bond’s price rose 0.101 centavo to 143.905 centavos per peso.
Three-month swap rates were little changed at 3.01 percent after
trading at a record low 3 percent for the past four days.  “All eyes are on today’s central bank meeting, so we’ll
probably have little volume as the market awaits the decision,”
Camila Estrada, the head analyst at Helm Bank SA in Bogota, said
in a telephone interview.  Banco de la Republica will lower the target lending  rate  by
a quarter-percentage point to 3 percent, according to 12 of 31
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest forecast that the
central bank will hold the benchmark at 3.25 percent. Policy
makers have lowered the target rate 2 percentage points since
the cycle of cuts began in July to revive economic growth.  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 1,832.36 per  U.S. dollar ,
extending its decline this year to 3.5 percent as the central
bank and the government increased dollar purchases to ease the
local currency’s rally. The peso surged 9.7 percent in 2012.  Banco de la Republica said Jan. 28 it will buy a minimum of
$30 million a day, increasing purchases in the currency  market
to at least $3 billion from February to May. Central bankers
will extend the bank’s dollar-purchase program at today’s
meeting to September, Estrada predicts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
