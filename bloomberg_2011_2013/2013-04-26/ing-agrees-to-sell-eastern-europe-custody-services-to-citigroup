ING Groep NV (INGA) , the biggest Dutch
financial-services company, agreed to sell custody services in
seven countries in central and eastern Europe to  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
as it scales back commercial banking operations.  ING will transfer 130 jobs as part of the deal, in which
Citigroup takes over custody services in Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine, it
said in a statement today. The Amsterdam-based company didn’t
disclose financial details and said the sale won’t have a
material impact on its results.  The Dutch company in November announced plans to cut 1,000
jobs in its commercial banking unit by 2015 to trim costs by
about 260 million euros ($339 million) amid stricter regulatory
requirements and “challenging operating conditions.” ING is
unwinding its lease business in 11 countries and has cut back
its equity capital markets operations.  ING announced last year it would eliminate about 130 jobs
as it reduced central and eastern European equities operations
to focus on  Belgium , the Netherlands and  Poland . The bank will
also continue to offer custody services in Poland, it said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
