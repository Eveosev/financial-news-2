Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM) , a gold
miner with operations in  Mexico ,  Canada  and  Finland , said it’s
“realistic” to expect prices of the precious metal will rise
to as much as $1,800 an ounce within the next 12 months.  Gold prices have probably bottomed and will increase
because the fundamentals in the market haven’t changed, Sean Boyd, chief executive officer of the Toronto-based company, said
in a telephone interview yesterday. Central-bank purchases and
continued economic stimulus programs by governments will support
gold, Boyd said.  Gold futures in  New York  have declined 12 percent this year
after 12 consecutive annual increases in which the metal rose
more than sixfold. Prices slipped into a  bear market  last week
after falling more than 20 percent from a record closing price
of $1,891.90 an ounce in August 2011. Gold reached a two-year
intraday low of $1,321.50 on April 16.  The drop was an “overreaction,” Boyd said in the
interview.  “We see this as a speculative move where traders quite
smartly and astutely took advantage of an opportunity and used
the paper market to make a great trade,” he said. “Within the
next 12 months we could see ourselves back in that $1,700 to
$1,800 range, I think that’s very realistic.”  Boyd said the company is considering further investments in
exploration and development companies and would look at a bigger
deal if it found something attractive. Lower metals prices and
weak equity valuations have left so-called junior companies
starved of capital, he said.  ‘Opportune Time’  Agnico-Eagle said this month it agreed to buy 10 percent in
both Vancouver-based  Kootenay Silver Inc. (KTN)  and Toronto-based
Sulliden Gold Corp., as well as warrants that entitle it to
increase its holdings. Agnico-Eagle is looking at similar
transactions now, Boyd said.  “It’s an opportune time, it’s a receptive group, they are
more open to ideas,” he said. “We see this as a time of
opportunity, we’re not going to sit on our hands.”  Agnico-Eagle yesterday reported first-quarter net income
fell to $23.9 million, or 14 cents a share, from $78.6 million,
or 46 cents, a year earlier. Earnings excluding a stock-option
expense and other one-time items were 31 cents a share, matching
the average of 18  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company said it still forecasts production of 970,000
to 1.01 million ounces of gold this year. The forecast for so-
called cash costs was increased to $735 to $785 an ounce, from a
Feb. 13 range of $700 to $750.  Agnico-Eagle fell 2.4 percent to C$32.83 at 10:40 a.m. in
Toronto.  The shares  have declined 37 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
