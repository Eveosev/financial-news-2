     April 26 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the largest U.S. maker
of smartphones, won a court ruling that it doesn’t infringe
patent claims brought by intellectual property licensing firm
 Golden Bridge Technology Inc.   U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Wilmington, Delaware,
also canceled a  jury trial  that was scheduled to begin April 29
over two patents for 3-G network communications held by Long
Branch, New Jersey-based Golden Bridge.  “The record evidence remains consistent with the finding
of non-infringement,” Robinson wrote in an order yesterday
affirming earlier decisions on the patent descriptions.  Golden Bridge sued Apple in 2010 over patents for boosting
connections in mobile networks.  “We respect the judge greatly, but justice wasn’t done and
of course, we will appeal,” Michael P. Kelly, a lawyer
representing Golden Bridge, said in a phone interview.  Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based
Apple, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on
the ruling.  The case is Golden Bridge Technology Inc. v. AT&T Inc., 10-
00428, U.S. District Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
