Purdue Pharma LP settled a patent-
infringement lawsuit against  Actavis (ACT)  Inc. over the pain
medication OxyContin.  Purdue will grant Actavis a license to sell “defined
quantities” of a generic version of the drug as early as next
year, the companies said in a statement today. Actavis, based in
Morristown, New Jersey, said it had infringed the Purdue
patents.  “Today’s agreement will promote competition and allow for
availability of generic formulations of reformulated
OxyContin,” according to the statement. “This resolution
relieves us of the risks, distractions and costs of continued
litigation.”  The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  said this month that
generic drug companies will be barred from making older versions
of OxyContin that aren’t resistant to tampering.  Purdue, based in  Stamford , Connecticut, replaced an older
version of OxyContin with a tamper-resistant formulation. The
drug, obtained illegally on the black market, has been abused by
addicts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
