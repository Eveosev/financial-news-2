China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) ,
the nation’s biggest wind-farm developer, reported a 13 percent
gain in first-quarter earnings as wind-power generation rose.  Net income climbed to 624 million  yuan  ($101 million) from
551 million yuan a year earlier, the company said in a filing to
the Hong Kong stock exchange. A 33 percent jump in wind-power
output drove sales up 8.9 percent to 4.42 billion yuan.  Longyuan has benefited from  China ’s decision to tighten
approval of new wind projects to ease grid congestion. The move
to slow development in the worst-affected areas has allowed
existing wind farms to operate closer to their installed
capacity. The company’s higher wind-power production countered a
decline in output at its other renewable-energy and coal plants.  Utilization rates recovered in China in the first quarter,
when wind-power generation grew more than 45 percent from a year
earlier, Karl Liu, a Hong Kong-based analyst at ICBC
International Research Ltd., wrote in an April 19 report. “We
expect that the sector is likely to outperform this year on
improved fundamentals.”  The National Energy Administration excluded the Jilin,
 Inner Mongolia  and Heilongjiang provinces from new wind-farm
permits in March because of overloaded grids in the regions. The
NEA said it will work to improve network connections.  China Datang Corp. Renewable Power Co., a state-owned
competitor of Beijing-based Longyuan, yesterday reported a 79
percent surge in quarterly earnings to 155 million yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
