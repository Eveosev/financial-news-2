Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the biggest U.S.
aluminum producer, had its credit rating outlook revised by
 Standard & Poor’s  Ratings Services to negative after a slump in
the price of the metal.  At current aluminum prices, Alcoa’s cashflow and debt are
“well outside our expectations” for the company’s BBB-
corporate credit rating, Standard & Poor’s said in a statement
today. The rating is the lowest investment-grade level.  “We expect the company to continue to post lower-than-
anticipated credit measures because of continuing weak aluminum
prices,” S&P said in the statement. “The company’s credit
measures will remain weak at least through 2013, reflecting
current weak prices, sluggish European demand, and slower-than-
expected growth in  China  thus far this year.”  Moody’s Investors Service Inc. said in December it was
putting Alcoa’s $8.6 billion of debt on review for downgrade.  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange has dropped 10 percent in the last 12 months as a
global oversupply of the lightweight metal and slowing growth in
China, the biggest consumer of the metal, weighs on prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
