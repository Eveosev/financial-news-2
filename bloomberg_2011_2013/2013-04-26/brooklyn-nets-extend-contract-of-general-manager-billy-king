The Brooklyn Nets extended the
contract of General Manager Billy King after the National
Basketball Association team qualified for the playoffs for the
first time in six seasons.  King was named general manager of the New Jersey Nets in
2010. He reconstructed the teamâ€™s roster before it moved to
Brooklyn, acquiring  Deron Williams  and Joe Johnson.  The Nets trail the Chicago Bulls in their best-of-seven
first-round playoff series two games to one. They play tomorrow
in Chicago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
