Hog futures extended a climb to a
three-week high on speculation that U.S. demand for pork will
increase as higher temperatures send people outdoors for
barbeques. Cattle fell.  Yesterday, wholesale  pork  climbed to a six-month high, and
spot  hogs  jumped 3.6 percent, the most since September, the
latest U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Most of the
Midwest will have drier, warmer weather through early next week,
Telvent DTN in Omaha,  Nebraska , said yesterday.  “There’s no doubt that the forecast for good weather
across the Midwest has got the market expecting better weekend
clearance of pork,” Doug Houghton, a commodity analyst at Brock
Associates in  Milwaukee , said in a telephone interview. “At the
same time, we’ve got hog supplies that should be tightening
seasonally.”  Hog futures for June settlement advanced 0.4 percent to
92.225 cents a pound at 10:25 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 92.55 cents, the highest
for a most-active contract since April 4.  The June price headed for the biggest weekly gain since
July. Yesterday, wholesale pork climbed 1 percent to 87.33 cents
a pound, the highest since Oct. 23, and spot hogs jumped 3.6
percent to 79.93 cents a pound, the biggest gain since Sept. 26.  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1.227
a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined 0.5
percent to $1.5135 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
