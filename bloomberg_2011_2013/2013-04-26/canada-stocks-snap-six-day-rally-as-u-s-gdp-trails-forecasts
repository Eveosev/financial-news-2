Canadian  stocks  fell for the first
time in seven days, paring a weekly gain, after data showed the
U.S. economy grew at a slower pace than forecast.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  dropped 1.3 percent after the pipeline
builder said delays in getting a U.S. presidential permit for
the Keystone XL oil conduit will push back its start until the
second half of 2015. Suncor Energy Inc.,  Canada ’s largest energy
producer, lost 1.1 percent as crude retreated for the first time
in seven days.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 109.31
points, or 0.9 percent, to 12,220.20 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark equity gauge gained 1.3 percent this week, trimming
its loss for the year to 1.7 percent.  “The U.S. numbers are definitely weaker than expected,”
Andrew Pyle, a fund manager with ScotiaMcLeod Inc., said on the
phone from Peterborough, Ontario. He manages C$210 million ($206
million). “That number has had an impact on oil. It was not a
disastrous number, but when people are looking for a 3 percent
handle on GDP, 2.5 percent takes some of the wind out of oil.”  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annual
rate, lower than forecast, after a 0.4 percent fourth-quarter
advance, Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median estimate of 86 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a 3 percent gain. Consumer spending, the biggest part
of the economy, climbed by the most since the fourth quarter of
2010.  Oil Stocks  Raw-materials and energy stocks  contributed  most to losses
in the S&P/TSX as eight of 10 industries retreated. Trading
volume was 13 percent lower than the 30-day average at this time
of the day.  TransCanada, Canada’s second-largest pipeline company,
decreased 1.3 percent to C$49.14. The company said its $5.3
billion cost estimate for the Keystone project will increase
depending on the timeline of the permit.  TransCanada has spent $1.8 billion on the project as of the
end of last month, which was originally targeted for a startup
in late 2014 or early 2015.  The Calgary-based company also  reported  first-quarter
earnings of 52 Canadian cents a share, short of the average
estimate of 54 cents according to a Bloomberg survey of 13
analysts.  Energy Shares  Suncor lost 1.1 percent to C$29.28 and Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd. dropped 2.1 percent to C$29.58. Crude for June
delivery declined 0.7 percent to settle at $93 a barrel in New
York to trim the biggest weekly advance since June. Prices rose
5.7 percent this week.  Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN)  dropped 5.8 percent to C$3.93 and First
Quantum Minerals Ltd. fell 7.4 percent to C$16.67 as copper fell
for the first time in three days. Stockpiles of the metal are
expanding ahead of a holiday that will close markets in  China ,
the world’s biggest consumer.  Royal Bank of Canada, the nation’s largest lender, lost 0.8
percent to C$60.02 and Toronto-Dominion Bank decreased 0.3
percent to C$81.10 as  financial  stocks fell for the first time
in four days.  Gabriel Resources Ltd. (GBU)  surged 29 percent to C$1.72, the
biggest gain since October 2008. Mediafax, a Romanian media
company, said the government plans to create a company called
Minvest Rosia Montana to take over the 19.3 percent stake held
by the state in Gabriel’s mine project, according to an
unpublished official document.  Gabriel’s Rosia  Montana  project has reported resources of
17.1 million ounces of gold and 81.1 million ounces of silver,
according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
