Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose, paring a weekly loss as spot demand climbed and
as some short-sellers closed their positions before three days
of public holidays next week.  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange advanced as much as 1 percent to 3,683  yuan  ($598) a
metric ton and was at 3,653 at 9:39 a.m. local time. That pared
a weekly decline to 0.9 percent.  Trading companies and some end-users step up purchases in
the  spot market  ahead of a holiday, supporting futures, Yu Yang,
an analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo Futures Co., said in a report
today. The SHFE usually raises margin requirements before
national holidays as a risk-control policy, Jiang Yuying, an
analyst at Chengdu Brilliant Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai today. Investors who don’t want to top up margins
usually close their positions, she said.  “Some short-sellers had substantial gains in the past two
weeks so it’s time to pocket gains,” Jiang said. Futures
touched 3,578 yuan on April 24, the lowest level since Dec. 5.  The average  spot price  for rebar was little changed at
3,568 yuan a ton yesterday, according to the Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port fell 0.4 percent to $134.60 a
dry ton yesterday, Steel Index Ltd. data show. The China Iron
and Steel Association will release its output estimate today for
the mid-April period. Production should have risen, Dang Man, an
analyst at Maike Futures Co., said from Xi’an yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
