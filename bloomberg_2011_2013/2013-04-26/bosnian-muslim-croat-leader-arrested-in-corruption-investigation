Zivko Budimir, president of one of
the two entities that make up Bosnia-Herzegovina, was arrested
along with 18 other people in a probe of alleged corruption, a
spokesman for the country’s  Prosecutor’s Office  said.  Petar Barisic, an adviser to Budimir, and Hidajet
Halilovic, head of the committee for pardons in the Muslim-Croat
Federation, based in Mostar, were among those arrested, the
spokesman, Boris Grubesic, said by phone.  Bosnia’s state security agency today questioned top
government officials and searched their offices in simultaneous
probes. The Prosecutor’s Office  said  it authorized the  State
Investigation and Protection Agency , or SIPA, to search the
offices of Bosnia’s Presidency in the capital, Sarajevo, and at
the headquarters of the Muslim-Croat Federation. Bosnia-
Herzegovina consists of the Federation and a Serb entity, known
as Republika Srpska.  The investigation focused on Budimir and his alleged role
in “cash-for-pardon” cases, state broadcaster  BHRT1  reported.
No one at Budimir’s office was immediately available to comment
on his arrest.  SIPA  said  it was focusing on “tens of persons” involved
in corruption, abuse of office, drug trafficking and organized
crime and that “searches are ongoing at many locations.”  “The aim of these investigative activities is to discover
corruption offenses whose perpetrators are the highest
officials,” the prosecutor’s office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
