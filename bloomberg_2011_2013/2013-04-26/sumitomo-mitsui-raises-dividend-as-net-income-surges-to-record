Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest bank by market value, said profit
surged 52 percent to a record and raised its annual dividend as
the value of its stockholdings climbed and bad-loan costs fell.  Net income  rose to 790 billion yen ($8 billion) in the year
ended March 31 from 518.5 billion yen a year earlier, the Tokyo-
based lender said in a preliminary earnings statement today. It
raised its annual  dividend  20 percent to 120 yen.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to end more than a
decade of deflation fueled a 35 percent increase in the
benchmark  Topix Index (TPX)  this year. Lenders’ revenue may grow if
the Bank of Japan’s monetary easing succeeds in reviving the
economy, boosting lending,  Standard & Poor’s  said this week.  Credit costs at lending unit  Sumitomo Mitsui  Banking Corp.
were 60 billion yen lower compared with its earlier projection,
according to the statement. Valuation profit from the bank’s
stockholdings more than tripled to 770 billion yen as of March
31 from 228.5 billion yen a year earlier, the bank said.  Sumitomo Mitsui is scheduled to announce its final earnings
on May 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
