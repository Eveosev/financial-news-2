India ’s rupee completed its first
weekly loss in three on speculation importers stepped up dollar
buying to pay month-end bills.  While these purchases pressured the rupee today, according
to  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , Morgan Stanley predicted in a research note
dated yesterday that the currency will be among the main
beneficiaries of a drop in gold and oil prices. Brent crude
dropped 6.5 percent this month to $103 per barrel and gold
prices fell 8.4 percent to $1,463.50 an ounce, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. India ships in 80 percent of its oil and is the
world’s top bullion importer.  “We see an increasingly compelling case to add long
exposure to the rupee,” analysts at Morgan Stanley, including
London-based Hans-Guenter Redeker, wrote in the report. Risks to
the currency, including those stemming from political volatility
before elections next year, “are well accounted for in the
recent underperformance,” they wrote.  The rupee declined 0.8 percent this week to 54.3750 per
dollar in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
lost 0.3 percent today. One-month implied volatility in the
rupee, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange rate used to
price options, fell 40 basis points, or 0.40 percentage point,
this week to 8.18 percent. It fell seven basis points today.  The central bank will lower its  repurchase rate  to 7.25
percent from 7.5 percent on May 3, according to 21 of 25
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Three see no change and one
forecasts a cut to 7 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.38 per
dollar, compared with 55.18 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.14 versus 54.95. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
