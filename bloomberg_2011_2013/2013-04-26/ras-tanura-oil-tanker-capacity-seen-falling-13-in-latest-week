The combined carrying capacity of
 oil tankers  calling at  Saudi Arabia ’s Ras Tanura fell 13 percent
in the week ended April 20, vessel-tracking data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The implied capacity of vessels calling at the world’s
largest crude-export complex slid to the equivalent of 7.66
million barrels a day from 8.80 million barrels for the prior
week, according to signals gathered by IHS Fairplay, a Redhill,
England-based maritime research company. The data may be
incomplete because not all transmissions are captured.  The Ras Tanura complex, including Ras al-Ju’aymah, is the
biggest global crude terminal, according to the website of Saudi
Arabian Oil Co., known as  Saudi Aramco . Tankers hauling crude
from the  Persian Gulf  may call at other loading ports before or
after  Ras Tanura , indicating they might have collected partial
cargoes elsewhere.  The table below lists the destination countries of tankers
calling at Ras Tanura in the latest week as of about 10 a.m.
London time today. The percentages represent the share of the
total number of ships loading at the terminal that each country
is due to receive. Very large crude carriers are assumed to
carry 2 million barrels apiece, twice as much as Suezmax
tankers. The tally excludes vessels smaller than Aframaxes, each
holding about 650,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
