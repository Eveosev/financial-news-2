The U.S. Treasury Department froze
some 2013 pay for top executives at  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)  and
 General Motors Co. (GM) , two firms yet to repay money received under
special bailout terms during the financial crisis.  Compensation for the chief executive officers of the two
firms is frozen, and cash compensation also won’t rise this
year, according to documents released today by Patricia Geoghegan, acting special master for compensation under the
Troubled Asset Relief Program. More than 80 percent of pay for
the top 25 highest-paid executives at the two Detroit-based
firms is stock and thus tied to performance, the agency said.  Ally CEO Michael Carpenter received $9.56 million in
compensation last year, including $9.5 million in deferred stock
units, according to a March 1 filing. Carpenter, 66, didn’t
receive a cash salary last year. The pay mix for GM CEO Dan Akerson, 64, was changed in 2012 to accommodate the possibility
he may retire before his long-term restricted stock vests in
three years, the company said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
