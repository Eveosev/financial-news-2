Norwegian phone company  Telenor ASA (TEL) 
and French bank  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  will expand in Serbia by
acquiring the equity and assets of  KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s subsidiary in
the former Yugoslav republic.  Telenor’s Serbian unit will take over all of KBC Banka AD’s
equity as it seeks to start a mobile banking business in Serbia,
while  Societe Generale ’s subsidiary is taking over 81,000
private clients and a portfolio of 209 million euros ($271.8
million) in loans and 142 million euros in deposits, the two
companies said in e-mailed statements in Belgrade today.  Serbia, which is working to start formal talks this year to
join the European Union, is trying to lure new cash to the
Balkan nation and persuade long-time investors that the nation
is stamping down on political instability.  “This acquisition only confirms our commitment to further
development and  Serbia ’s economic growth, as well as our
contribution to the stability of the banking sector in Serbia,”
SocGen’s Serbian Chief Executive Officer Frederic Coin said in
the statement.  KBC’s shares were down 0.7 percent at 29.685 euros by 1:17
p.m. in Brussels, while Telenor’s shares fell 2 percent to 127.9
krone in Oslo and SocGen was trading at 26.615 euros, 1.3
percent lower from the previous day in Paris, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The transaction is expected to reduce KBC’s earnings by an
estimated 47 million euros, including 17 million euros in the
first quarter of 2013.  Global Expansion  Telenor, the world’s sixth-largest mobile operator, is
pursuing a global expansion to the banking business with a
worldwide revenue target of $1 billion through 2016.  The acquisition was the “fastest way to enter the
market,” the company said in a statement, citing Ove Fredheim,
the head of Telenor’s Serbian unit. The transaction in Serbia
needs approval from the central bank and the competition
watchdog.  Telenor’s local revenue rose 7.8 percent to 10.06 billion
dinars ($117 million) in the first half of 2013, it said.  KBC Banka accumulated a 2.24 billion-dinar loss in 2012.
Its assets stood at 29 billion dinars and capital was worth 3.4
billion dinars, according its 2012 financial report published by
the National Bank of Serbia.  Taking over KBC’s clients will not affect the ranking of
the French bank and it will remain the fourth-biggest lender in
Serbia by assets, central bank figures show. SocGen’s assets in
Serbia stood at 202.9 billion dinars at the end of 2012 and the
bank had a pretax profit of 116 million dinars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
