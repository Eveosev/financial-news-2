Puerto Rico , which has a  credit
rating  lower than any U.S. state, sold $335 million of short-
term debt backed by sales-tax revenue this week, the first
borrowing by a commonwealth issuer since November, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corp. sold the notes in a
private placement with Barclays Capital Inc. as underwriter,
Bloomberg data show. Payment is due Sept. 30, 2014, with an
interest rate of 1.95 percent. All three major credit-rating
companies grade Puerto Rico’s general-obligation debt one step
above non-investment grade, with a negative outlook. Moody’s
Investors Service rates the subordinated sales-tax bonds at A3,
three steps above its general-obligation Baa3.  Municipal debt sold in Puerto Rico is tax-exempt in all
U.S. states. Javier Ferrer, president of the Government
Development Bank for Puerto Rico, the island’s fiscal agent,
wasn’t immediately available to comment on the sale, Betsy
Nazario, a spokeswoman for the bank, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
