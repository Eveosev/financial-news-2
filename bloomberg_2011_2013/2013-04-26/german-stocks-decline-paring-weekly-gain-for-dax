German stocks  declined, paring the
biggest weekly rally in five months for the benchmark DAX Index,
as bank shares slid.  Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG, Germany’s largest
lenders, each fell at least 1.5 percent. Puma SE retreated for a
third day after sales at the maker of sports footwear dropped in
the first quarter.  BASF SE (BAS)  advanced to a one-month high as the
world’s biggest chemical company posted quarterly profit
increased more that analysts had predicted.  The DAX lost 0.2 percent to 7,816.79 at 9:56 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The gauge has still gained 4.8 percent as data showed
the U.K. avoided a triple-dip recession and investors speculated
the  European Central Bank  will cut  interest rates . The broader
HDAX Index also slipped 0.3 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the DAX was 34 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., a report may show gross domestic product rose
at a 3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter after
expanding at a 0.4 percent pace in the final three months of
2012, according to the median forecast of 86 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The Commerce Department will release the
figures at at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
