South Korea’s won led gains in
Asian currencies this week after economic growth exceeded
forecasts. The  Thai baht  completed its worst five days in seven
years amid speculation of currency control measures.  The won advanced to a four-week high as South Korea’s gross
domestic product increased 0.9 percent last quarter, beating the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a rise of 0.7 percent.
Reports showed the U.K. economy avoided a triple-dip recession
and U.S. jobless claims fell last week, raising optimism about
the strength of a global recovery. China’s  yuan  reached a 19-
year high on signs capital inflows are rising.  “Some of the  risk premium  in the won is being unwound,
plus the good data yesterday that was a surprise,” said Leo Chan, head of regional foreign-exchange and interest-rate
trading in  Hong Kong  at ABN Amro Bank NV. “We are also seeing
people offering a lot of dollars with the stronger yuan fix.”  The won strengthened 0.4 percent to 1,112.01 per dollar in
 Seoul  from April 19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The yuan gained 0.2 percent to 6.1650, capping a nine-week rally.
Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.5 percent to NT$29.705. The baht lost
2.6 percent to 29.42, its worst week since December 2006, and
India’s rupee weakened 0.7 percent to 54.355.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, was little
changed from April 19. It gained 0.6 percent in the previous two
weeks.  Yuan Appreciation  The yuan touched 6.1616 per dollar today, the strongest
level since the government unified the official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993, after the People’s Bank of
China raised its fixing by 0.15 percent to 6.2208. The nation’s
financial and capital-account surplus was $101.8 billion in the
first quarter, the most since 2010 and almost double the $56.1
billion for the same period of 2012, official data showed
yesterday.  “Pressure for yuan appreciation is growing as China’s
surplus jumped,” said  Daniel Chan , a Hong Kong-based executive
vice president at Glory Sky Global Markets Ltd. “Fund inflows
have been strong and that’s boosting the  exchange rate .”  Baht Plunge  The baht slumped after  Permanent Secretary  for Finance
Areepong Bhoocha-oom said in Bangkok the ministry may “adjust
conditions on the purchase of  government bonds ,” without
providing details. Foreign investors were net buyers of $12
billion of Thai sovereign debt this year, fanning the currency’s
rally to a 16-year high on April 19.  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra called a meeting on the
baht, the Thai language Krungthep Turakij newspaper reported
today, without saying where it got the information.  “Because of the rhetoric, the market is on the lookout for
possible controls” on capital flows, said Sim Moh Siong, a
currency strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “If anything,
those will be mild measures aimed to slow inflows rather than to
stem the inflows altogether.”  Elsewhere in Asia this week, the  Philippine peso  lost 0.4
percent to 41.222 per dollar after the central bank cut the rate
it pays on special-deposit accounts yesterday for the third time
in 2013. Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 9,722, while
Vietnam’s dong slipped 0.2 percent to 20,930.  To contact the reporter on this story:
