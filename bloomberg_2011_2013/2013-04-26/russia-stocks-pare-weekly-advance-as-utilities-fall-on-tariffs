Russian  equities  dropped, paring
their gain for the week as power stocks retreated on concern the
government will slow tariff increases.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  lost 0.6 percent to 1,364.18 by 11:16 a.m.
in Moscow, poised for a 1.9 percent advance in the week.
Utilities led the declines among nine industry groups, trading
down 2.3 percent on average. OAO RusHydro, Russia’s biggest
renewable energy producer, sank 2.9 percent to 50.09 kopeks,
while Federal Grid Co. fell 3.3 percent to 11 kopeks and OAO
Russian Grids, formerly known as MRSK Holding, retreated 2.8
percent to 1.143 rubles.  The government is searching for “compromise options” as
it reviews planned increases in tariffs for gas, transport and
electricity, Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  told
reporters today. The Economy Ministry is seeking a 6 percent
increase in power tariffs for grid companies for 2014-2015
compared with 9 percent to 10 percent planned earlier, Interfax
reported yesterday, citing an unidentified ministry official.  “RusHydro and distribution companies stand to lose the
most,” UralSib Capital analysts including Matvey Taits in
Moscow wrote in an e-mailed note. “Limiting distribution and
transmission tariff growth to 6 percent creates significant
risks” for power companies and “will delay the return on
capital,” he said.  OAO Gazprom, Russia’s biggest natural gas producer, tumbled
0.9 percent to 121.83 rubles. The Economy Ministry is seeking a
5 percent increase in  gas prices  for industrial users for
2014-2015 compared with 15 percent earlier, Interfax reported.
Gazprom has the second-biggest weighting on the Micex at 15
percent.  Surgut Earnings  Crude oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, retreated 0.7
percent to $92.96 a barrel in  New York , the first drop in six
days.  OAO Surgutneftegas, an oil producer, surged as much as 2.5
percent, trading up 0.9 percent at 28.10 rubles. The company
will report earnings based on international accounting standards
for the first time since 2001 on April 30, it said on April 24.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The measure trades at 5.1
times its 12-month estimated earnings and has lost 7.8 percent
this year, compared with a 10.3 multiple for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index, which has dropped 2.9 percent in the period.  The number of shares traded on the Micex was 1.3 times
above its 30-day average, while the gauge’s 10-day price swings
subsided to 18.438.  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
 stock futures , added 0.6 percent to 21.55, the first advance in
four days. The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, jumped 0.4 percent to 26.37
yesterday, while the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index added 0.7
percent to 93.55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
