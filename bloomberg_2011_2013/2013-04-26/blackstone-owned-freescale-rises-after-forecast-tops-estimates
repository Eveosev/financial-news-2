Freescale Semiconductor Ltd. (FSL) , the
chipmaker mostly owned by a private-equity group including
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and TPG Capital, rose after predicting
second-quarter sales that may exceed some analysts’ estimates.  Second-quarter revenue will be $1 billion to $1.04 billion,
the Austin, Texas-based company said yesterday in a statement.
Analysts on average had estimated sales of $1.01 billion,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Freescale is a supplier of analog chips, microcontrollers
and network processors competing with companies such as  Texas
Instruments Inc. (TXN)  It supplies chips used in cars, phone systems
and consumer electronics.  The company’s first-quarter net loss was $48 million, or 19
cents a share, compared with a loss of $9 million, or 4 cents a
share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales rose 3.3 percent
to $981 million, topping analysts’ average $966.3 million
estimate. Interest payments of $121 million on  debt  created when
the company was taken private contributed to the loss.  Freescale’s  shares  rose 8 percent to $15.71 at the close in
New York. The stock has advanced 43 percent this year, compared
with a 13 percent gain by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
