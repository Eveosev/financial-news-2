Shipments of rolled-aluminum
products by Japanese fabricators to domestic and overseas
markets decreased at a slower pace in March, supported by demand
from beverage-can makers, according to an industry group.  Volume fell 1.5 percent to 171,163 metric tons last month
from a year earlier, the  Japan  Aluminium Association said in a
report today. The pace of decline slowed from February’s 8.2
percent rate.  The decrease was led by the auto sector as vehicle sales in
Japan declined 11.3 percent in March because of an end to
subsidy payments by the government to buyers of fuel-efficient
models. The weakness was partially offset by 4.9 percent growth
in demand for flat-rolled products from beverage-can makers.  The association expects shipments for the year through
March will expand 3.2 percent to 2.02 million tons, the highest
level in three years, as a weak yen boosts exports, while
Japan’s fiscal and monetary stimulus boosts demand from builders.  Members of the association include Furukawa-Sky Aluminum
Corp., Kobe Steel Ltd. and Nippon Light Metal Co. Details of
output, shipments and inventories for February are as follows:
