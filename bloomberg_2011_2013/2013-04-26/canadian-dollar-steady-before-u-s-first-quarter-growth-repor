The Canadian dollar was little
changed versus its U.S. counterpart ahead of U.S. gross domestic
product figures expected to show growth picked up in  Canada ’s
largest trading partner in the first quarter.  The Canadian dollar was headed for a weekly gain on the
greenback before a report that will show the  U.S. economy 
expanded 3 percent in the first three months of the year from
0.4 percent growth the previous period, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 86 economists. A report next week will show Canada’s
economic growth stagnated in February at 0.2 percent, matching
the previous month’s pace, according to the median estimate of a
Bloomberg survey of seven economists.  “GDP data are expected to be good, expected to reflect
that there was a strong start to the year in the U.S., but I
think traders have moved on,” said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International, by phone from  London .
“What we’ve seen in the last few weeks is a lot of softer data
so we have this risk that we’re entering a spring slump in the
U.S. and if that is the case that will be the third consecutive
year. Are we seeing another slump? If we are it probably means
the dollar won’t be able to take much sustained encouragement
from the GDP data.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the water fowl on the C$1 coin, was little changed at
C$1.0203 per  U.S. dollar  at 8:04 a.m. in Toronto. One loonie
buys 98.01 U.S. cents. The loonie has gained 0.6 percent this
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
