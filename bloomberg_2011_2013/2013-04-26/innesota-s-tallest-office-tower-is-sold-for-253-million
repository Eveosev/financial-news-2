(Corrects broker’s name in fourth paragraph of story
published April 26.)  Inland American Real Estate Trust
Inc. sold the 57-story IDS Center, the tallest building in
 Minnesota , for $253 million to a joint venture of Beacon
Investment Properties LLC and two Israeli companies.  Beacon, based in Hallandale Beach, Florida, bought the
property with Tel Aviv-based  Harel Insurance Investments &
Financial Services Ltd. (HARL)  and Menora Mivtahim Insurance Ltd., the
companies said today in a statement.  Inland, a nontraded real estate investment trust, had
pulled the tower off the market just four months ago. The  Oak
Brook , Illinois-based REIT has been shifting its focus to
retail, lodging and student-housing holdings. It bought the IDS
Center in 2006 for about $277 million.  “It is the centerpiece of downtown Minneapolis,” Jaime
Fink, a broker with  HFF Inc. (HF) , which represented Inland, said in
the statement. “There was very strong interest in the property
from international and national investors.”  Demand is rising for office space in Minneapolis. The
 vacancy rate  fell to 18.2 percent in the fourth quarter from
18.8 percent a year earlier, according to data from  Reis Inc. (REIS) , a
New York-based research firm. Rents rose to $16.97 a square foot
from $16.70 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
