Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , the
largest U.S. mall owner, reported an increase in first-quarter
funds from operations and raised its FFO forecast for the year
as retailers sought more space in regional shopping centers.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, climbed to $741.9 million, or $2.05 a share, from $648.7
million, or $1.82, a year earlier, the Indianapolis-based real
estate investment trust said today in a statement. That compares
with a $2.01-a-share  average  of 21 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Demand for mall space is rising, helping increase revenue
at Simon. Vacancies at major malls fell to 8.3 percent in the
first quarter from 9 percent a year earlier, and rents rose to
$39.46 a square foot from $39, New York-based research firm  Reis
Inc. (REIS)  said earlier this month. Simon is the biggest U.S. owner of
both regional malls and outlet centers, where retailers sell at
a discount.  “There’s more demand for good quality mall space than
there is supply,” John Sheehan, an analyst at  Edward Jones  in
 St. Louis , said by telephone before the results were announced.
“If the whole group is improving, that should bode well for the
largest mall landlord in America.”  Revenue increased 8.6 percent from a year earlier to $1.22
billion. Occupancies at Simon’s U.S. properties climbed to 94.7
percent from 93.6 percent. The base minimum rent in the first
quarter was $41.05 a square foot, up from $39.87. Tenant sales
rose 5.3 percent to $575 a square foot.  The company raised its estimate of FFO for the year to
$8.50 to $8.60 a share, up from a February forecast of $8.40 to
$8.50 a share. The average of 22 analyst estimates is $8.59.  First-quarter results were announced before the start of
regular U.S. trading. Simon fell 0.5 percent to $176.01
yesterday. The shares have advanced 15 percent in 12 months,
compared with a 14 percent gain for the Bloomberg REIT Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
