The U.S. must be “really careful”
in determining its response to evidence from intelligence
agencies that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime may have
used chemical weapons, said U.S. Senator Angus King of  Maine .  “We got to be sure that it really is the regime and not
the opposition that is planting evidence in order to draw us
in,” King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said in
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital With
 Al Hunt ” airing this weekend. “These are very serious
consequences.”  King’s comments followed an April 25 classified briefing
for senators in which Secretary of State  John Kerry  detailed
developments in  Syria . President  Barack Obama  is under renewed
pressure to intervene from lawmakers including Senator  John McCain , an  Arizona  Republican who has advocated arming Syrian
rebels.  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel stressed on April 25 that the
new intelligence assessment isn’t a sufficient basis for
military intervention.  Based on the briefing, King said it was “hard to tell
exactly” whether sarin nerve gas had been used, adding that
“it appears at a minor level” rather than “a large usage.”  King, a member of the Intelligence and Armed Services
committees, drew a parallel to the U.S. military effort in
Afghanistan to explain his concern about arming opposition
forces.  Arming Opposition  “We’ve already had the experience in  Afghanistan  of arming
the opposition and then having those arms used against us five
or 10 years later,” he said. “What I’m hearing is that the
opposition is armed and they’re getting arms from other people.
They don’t necessarily have to get arms from us.”  Obama had “better be sure” that the “red line” his
administration has drawn regarding the Syrian government’s use
of chemical weapons has actually been crossed before “doing
anything significant,” King said.  Still, ensuring that any chemical weapons have been secured
in the event that “the opposition wins and the country
fragments” could be a challenge as well, he said.  Obama said yesterday the U.S. will seek confirmation along
with the  United Nations  that Assad’s regime used chemical
weapons.  “There are a range of questions around how, when, where
these weapons may have been used,” Obama said yesterday before
meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House. “All
of us -- not just in the United States, but around the world --
recognize how we cannot stand by and permit the systematic use
weapons like chemical weapons on civilian populations,” he said
in his first public remarks on Syria since the U.S. disclosed it
had evidence of use of chemical weapons. He didn’t specify what
action the U.S. might take.  Budget Standoff  Elected in November, King also sits on the Budget Committee
and said the odds were 50-50 that Republican and Democratic
lawmakers may reach a  deficit-reduction  accord that would raise
 tax revenue  while cutting rates.  “The House -- the Ryan budget, interestingly, raises a lot
of new revenues, but it turns around and gives it all back in
the form of very large tax cuts,” he said, referring to House
Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan  of  Wisconsin .  ‘Deal Maker’  “The Senate raises revenues, not as much, from tax
expenditures, loopholes and deductions,” King said. “They put
it all toward deficit reduction. To me, as an old deal maker,
the deal is, OK, let’s compromise between those two.”  During his first four months in Congress, King said he’s
been surprised to see that his colleagues “want to be a little
more cooperative and work together, particularly at the
committee level.”  “You hear all the stuff about the poisonous atmosphere and
the partisanship,” he said. “What I’ve observed is the Senate
is very partisan institutionally, but personally it isn’t. It
isn’t a poisonous atmosphere personally. There are a lot of
relationships.”  By using armed drones to kill suspected terrorists
overseas, the U.S. runs the risk of generating more terrorists,
King said.  “That’s the dilemma,” he said. “I saw a story last night
of a guy from  Yemen  who basically said the drones radicalized
his village, and they were always pro-American. That’s a tough
call because the drone program has been very effective in
essentially decimating al-Qaeda.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
