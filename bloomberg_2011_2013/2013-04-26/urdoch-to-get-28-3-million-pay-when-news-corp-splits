Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire
founder of  News Corp. (NWSA) , is eligible for $28.3 million in combined
compensation next year, up 15 percent from 2013, as his media
empire breaks up into two businesses.  Murdoch’s base pay in 2014 will amount to $8.1 million,
with a bonus target of $12.5 million and a potential $7.7
million long-term incentive, the company said today in  a filing .
The figures include compensation from the new 21st Century Fox
entertainment business of $7.1 million in base pay, a $10.5
million bonus and $5.7 million in long-term incentives.  Murdoch’s target compensation will rise from a total $24.6
million for fiscal 2013, which ends in June, the New York-based
company said. His new pay package leans more heavily toward
bonus incentives, while his base salary remains the same at $8.1
million. He will serve as chief executive officer and chairman
of 21st Century Fox, while remaining chairman of the new News
Corp.  Murdoch, who began building News Corp. more than a half-
century ago with newspapers, gave in to shareholder pressure
last year to separate the declining publishing division from his
more profitable television and film businesses. The
entertainment spinoff will include cable and broadcast networks,
as well as the Twentieth Century Fox studio.  The publishing side of News Corp., which includes the Wall
Street Journal and the  New York  Post, will retain that name.
That business will have $2.6 billion in cash and no debt, News
Corp. said in March.  Losing Money  The new publishing company reported a pro forma net loss of
$1.89 billion in the fiscal year that ended on June 30, with
sales of $9.14 billion. The loss included $2.6 billion in
writedowns, mostly reductions in the value of newspapers,
highlighting the challenges facing Robert Thomson, who will
become CEO of the new company after serving as managing editor
of the Wall Street Journal.  Still, the company may use its cash to pursue additional
newspapers. Murdoch, 82, is considering a bid for the Los
Angeles Times, according to people familiar with the company’s
plans.  Tribune Co. (TRBAA) , which owns the Times as well as seven other
dailies, would prefer selling its newspaper group in a single
transaction, people said in March.  News Corp. shares  rose 0.3 percent to $31.20 yesterday. The
stock has climbed 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
