Aluminum may rise for a third week
next week in  London , though gains are likely to be capped at
about $2,000 a metric ton, according to technical analysis by
Barclays Plc.  The attached chart shows prices yesterday climbed above
$1,928 a ton, the top of the range that starts with the April 16
session. The 50 percent retracement of the drop from Feb. 15 to
April 15, a level singled out in so-called Fibonacci analysis,
and the 200-day moving average lie ahead, forming resistance,
said Lynnden Branigan, a technical analyst at Barclays.  “Given the corrective upticks in the base complex,
aluminum could be dragged higher over the next week,” Branigan
said in an e-mail yesterday. “The break above $1,928 is
expected to be capped in the $2,000 area.”  The lightweight metal, used in products from soda cans to
aircraft, touched the lowest price since October 2009 on April
15 at $1,818 a ton. Aluminum for delivery in three months traded
at $1,931.75 at 6:55 a.m. today on the London Metal Exchange,
down 6.8 percent this year.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is
based on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain
percentages after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
