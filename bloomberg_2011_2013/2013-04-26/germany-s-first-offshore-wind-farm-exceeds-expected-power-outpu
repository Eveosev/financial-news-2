Germany ’s first offshore wind farm
generated more power than expected because of steady winds last
year, operators of the Alpha Ventus park including EON SE said.  Alpha Ventus’s 12 turbines last year fed 267.8 gigawatt-
hours of electricity into the German grid at a yield 15.3
percent higher than originally forecast, EON, Vattenfall Europe
AG and EWE AG said today in an e-mailed statement.  The 5-megawatt machines, supplied by Areva SA and  Suzlon
Energy Ltd. (SUEL)  unit REpower Systems SE, achieved 4,463 full load
hours, matching the level in 2011, they said. The availability
in 2013 of Alpha Ventus will decrease from last year’s 96.5
percent because of maintenance work, the operators said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
