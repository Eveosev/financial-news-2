Canadian heavy oil strengthened on
the  spot market  in light trading outside of the index period.  Western Canada Select heavy oil for June delivery gained 75
cents against U.S. West Texas Intermediate oil to trade at a
$16.50 discount, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc.
The company showed one trade booked as of 12:43 p.m.  New York 
time.  The  index period  begins on the first of the month and sets
the price averages for grades to be delivered to buyers the
following month. The majority of Canadian spot oil trading
occurs during the index period, which ended for May delivery on
April 17 and begins for June delivery on May 1.  There was no trading in Syncrude, a synthetic light oil
produced from Canadian bitumen, and the price was unchanged at a
$3 per-barrel premium to WTI, Net Energy said.  WCS and Syncrude have declined after reaching six-month
highs in early April. Demand is down as several refineries in
the U.S. Midwest conduct planned maintenance.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) â€™s Joliet, Illinois refinery shut down
mid-April for about five weeks. Northern Tier Energy planned to
shut its St. Paul Park refinery down this month for 25 days of
work, the company said on a March 14 conference call. Calumet
Specialty Products Partners LP shut the Superior, Wisconsin
plant April 15 through May 20 for a turnaround.  To contact the reporter on this story:
