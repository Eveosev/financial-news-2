A consortium led by a subsidiary of
 Brazil ’s  CCR SA (CCRO3) ,  Latin America ’s biggest highway manager by
market value, won the tender for the light  rail  train that forms
part of Brazilian government’s plan to transform Rio de
Janeiro’s historic center and port area in time for the 2016
summer Olympic games.  The consortium was the sole bidder, offering 1.6 billion
reais ($800 million), Luiz Carlos de Souza Lobo, director of
operations of Rio de Janeiro’s port development company, said by
telephone. Other consortium members include Odebrecht TransPort,
Invepar, RioPar, RATP’s local subsidiary, and Benito Roggio e
Hijos SA.  The federal government will provide 500 million reais for
the project, known as VLT, through its Growth Acceleration
Program (PAC), and the remainder will be financed through a
public-private partnership. The VLT will have six lines and 42
stations, according to CDURP’s website. While the city plans for
the works to be complete in time for the games, no sporting
events will take place in the downtown area.  The VLT is an urban transport solution that could have been
applied more broadly in Rio, Chris Gaffney, visiting professor
at the Graduate School of Architecture and Urbanism at Brazil’s
Universidade Federal Fluminense, said by telephone from Rio.  “It is the first VLT being done, and I hope it is the
first in a series,” said Jorge Luiz de Souza Arraes, Rio’s
deputy secretary of strategic projects and public/private
partnerships. “The area needs some means of transport
integrated with other means, and no other area of the city has
such good characteristics for this project.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
