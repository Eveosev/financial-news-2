China  Development Bank Corp. will
sell $500 million of five-year dollar-denominated bonds on April
28, the first such onshore issue in almost three years,
according to a statement posted on ChinaBond’s website yesterday.  The biggest policy lender in China will offer the
securities at a yield of 125 basis points more than the three-
month London interbank offered rate, according to  ChinaBond , the
nation’s largest debt-clearing house. Libor was set at 0.276
percent yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the company’s existing offshore five-year
bonds, sold in December 2012, dropped one basis point to 1.62
percent yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It last sold
dollar-denominated notes domestically in July 2010, pricing $400
million of three-year securities at 90 basis points more than
six-month  Libor. (US0003M)   One-year dollar borrowing costs in the interbank market
climbed 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, this year to
1.95 percent, according to data provided by ICAP Plc. Similar-
maturity Libor dropped 13 basis points to 0.71 percent.  The lead underwriters for the new issue are Agricultural
Bank of China Ltd., China Merchants Bank Co., Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp.,
Bank of Communication Co. and Industrial Bank Co.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Simon Harvey, Anil Varma  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
