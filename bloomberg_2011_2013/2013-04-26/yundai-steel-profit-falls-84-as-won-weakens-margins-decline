Hyundai Steel Co. (004020) ,  South Korea ’s
second-biggest steelmaker, reported a 84 percent drop in first-
quarter profit as a fall in demand narrowed margins and a weaker
won caused foreign exchange losses.  Net income  fell to 24.8 billion won ($22.3 million) in the
three months ended March 31., compared with 156 billion won a
year earlier, the Incheon-based company said in a regulatory
filing today. That missed the average profit of 53.2 billion
won, according to 16  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit margins have narrowed at South Korea’s steelmakers
as prices were forced lower due to slowing growth in  China , the
world’s biggest producer and consumer of the alloy.  Europe ’s
debt crisis also reduced demand.  The Korean won weakened 4.4 percent against the dollar in
the first quarter and the company booked 99 billion won in
exchange losses related to its foreign-currency denominated
debt, Hyundai said.  Earnings may recover in the second quarter from expansion
at a hot-rolled coil line and a seasonal pick-up in demand for
construction steel, according to analyst Bang Min Jin at HI
Investment & Securities Co. Net income may climb to 205.6
billion won in the second quarter, according to the mean of 16
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares in Hyundai Steel, an affiliate of the  Hyundai Motor (005380) 
Group, fell 0.4 percent to close at 72,700 won in Seoul trading
today, bringing this year’s loss to 17 percent. The benchmark
 Kospi (KOSPI)  index has fallen 2.6 percent and bigger rival Posco has
lost 9.5 percent this year. The earnings were announced after
the market closed.  Operating profit fell 13 percent to 140.2 billion won in
the first quarter, higher than the 128.2 billion won average of
17 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 21
percent to 2.98 trillion won. The operating profit  margin  was
4.4 percent in the quarter, compared with 4.3 percent a year ago
and 4.9 percent in the previous quarter, Hyundai said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
