Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
most popular search engine, spent $291 million on acquisitions
and assets during the first quarter as the company looked to
bolster revenue and user growth.  Among the eight deals last quarter, $150 million was for
patents and developed technology, the company said in a filing
yesterday. In February, the company announced it agreed to buy
Channel Intelligence Inc. for $125 million, adding online-
marketing tools used by retailers to bolster  Internet sales .  Google is stepping up purchases of companies and technology
to expand beyond its core search-based advertising business.
Last year, the company completed its largest acquisition, buying
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. for $12.5 billion, adding
patents and a smartphone and tablet business.  “These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and
depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional
areas, our technologies, and our product offerings,” the
 Mountain View , California-based company said in the filing.  Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency has closed
an investigation into the alleged release of refrigerant at one
of its data-center facilities, as well as the accuracy of
related statements and records, the company said in the filing.  In January, the company was informed by the  U.S. Department
of Justice  that the EPA investigation, which the company learned
of in 2009, had concluded, according to the filing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
