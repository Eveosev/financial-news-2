Azerbaijan’s credit rating was
affirmed by  Fitch Ratings , which cited strong state finances,
cash from energy sales and low debt.  The long-term foreign and local currency ratings were left
at BBB-, the lowest investment grade and on par with  Romania ,
Croatia, Bulgaria and  Turkey . Fitch kept the outlook on its
assessment at stable.  The rating “weighs a strong government balance sheet, the
product of windfall oil revenue and low indebtedness, against
high oil dependence and poor governance,” Fitch analyst Charles Seville said today in an e-mailed statement from London.
“Azerbaijan’s sovereign balance sheet is one of the strongest
among rated sovereigns and mitigates the budget’s high
dependence on oil revenues.”  Azerbaijan’s economy grew 3.1 percent from a year earlier
in the first quarter as surging non-energy output outweighed a
decline in energy production.  Government spending  has grown “rapidly” in recent years
and will reach 40 percent of gross domestic product in 2013,
according to Fitch, which said that maintaining a similar pace
would undermine public finances and erode Azerbaijan’s net asset
position in the medium term.  Fitch said the country’s oil production has peaked and
output will fall “relatively steeply” in the next decade,
curbing the government’s ability to save energy revenue for the
future and invest to promote non-oil activity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
