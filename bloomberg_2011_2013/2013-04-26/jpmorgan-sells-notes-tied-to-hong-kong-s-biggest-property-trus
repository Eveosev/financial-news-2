JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  sold the first
structured notes tied to Hong Kong’s largest property trust in
more than 15 months, as rising rents in the city fuel gains in
real estate investments.  The bank on April 3 sold HK$4.5 million ($580,000) of
securities tied to The  Link (823)  Real Estate Investment Trust, Hong
Kong’s biggest REIT, and Wharf Holdings Ltd., the owner of the
Times Square and Harbour City malls, according to an e-mail from
the lender’s staff handling structured products in the city. The
product pays monthly coupons for days when the prices of the two
underlying assets remain in certain ranges, according to the e-
mailed response to queries.  The Link REIT, which owns and manages shopping centers and
parking spaces, and  Wharf (4)  both rose to all-time highs this
month. Average Hong Kong rents for prime shopping locations may
rise 8 percent this year, according to property broker CBRE
Group Inc.  Polly Leung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment on why the bank chose to link the notes to
the property investments.  HSBC Holdings Plc had last issued notes tied to the Link
REIT, along with other stocks, in December 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
