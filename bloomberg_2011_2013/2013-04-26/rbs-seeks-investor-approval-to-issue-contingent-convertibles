Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, will ask investors to
let it issue bonds that would become equity in a crisis, the
third U.K. bank to say it will seek approval for such plans.  The so-called equity convertible notes would convert into
RBS shares if the lender’s capital level fell below a preset
amount, the Edinburgh-based company said in a statement today.
The bank didn’t detail any immediate plans to issue the notes.  Because converting the securities into equity would dilute
existing shareholders, RBS is asking shareholders for powers to
issue shares with a nominal value of 1.5 billion pounds ($2.3
billion), about 4.4 billion pounds at today’s market price.
Investors will vote on the proposals at a May 14 meeting.  RBS follows  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  in
seeking investor backing to issue contingent convertible
securities as regulators press British banks to bolster capital.
The securities have drawn criticism from shareholder advisory
groups, which focus on the risk CoCos will deny existing
stockholders the right of first refusal on any new equity
created if the securities convert into stock.  RBS fell as much as 3.5 percent and was down 2.3 percent at
293.8 pence as of 3:18 p.m. in London trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
