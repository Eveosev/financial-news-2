Equatorial Guinea  plans to keep
exports of its Ceiba crude in June unchanged from May at two
cargoes, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  shows.  The country will ship three consignments of its Zafiro
blend, a schedule on April 17 showed. The plan for Aseng, the
nation’s third export grade, wasn’t yet available.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
