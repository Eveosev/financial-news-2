Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund, known
as Sofaz, will look past the biggest drop in  gold prices  since
1983 and continue investing in the precious metal, Executive
Secretary Shahmar Movsumov said.  “Investing in gold was a strategic decision to diversify
holdings,” Movsumov told reporters today in Baku, the Azeri
capital. “We have no plans to profit by selling it.”  Gold, which rallied for the past 12 years in the longest
gain in at least nine decades, plunged into a  bear market  on
April 12 on speculation central banks in  Europe  may sell
holdings to raise funds and as investors sold bullion-backed
exchange-traded products. With $34.3 billion in assets on April
1, equivalent to almost 50 percent of the Azeri economy, Sofaz
targets keeping 5 percent of the stockpile in the precious metal
to diversify its portfolio.  Sofaz, established in 1999 to manage the Caspian Sea
nation’s income from the sale of oil and natural gas, started
investing in gold in February 2012. The fund bought 18.4 metric
tons by the end of the first quarter and said it plans to
increase the holdings to 30 tons by the year-end. Sofaz’s assets
grew 0.6 percent in the first quarter from the end of last year.  Gold for immediate delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
$1,461.38 an ounce by 10:06 a.m. in  London . Bullion for delivery
in June fell 0.1 percent to $1,460.70 on the Comex in  New York .
Investors cut assets in gold-backed exchange-traded products to
2,294.5 metric tons yesterday, the lowest level since October
2011, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Property Investments  Sofaz is also planning to invest $1 billion in real estate
this year, with a focus on Asian markets, Movsumov said.  “While the economic decline still continues around the
world,  Asia  is the only place that’s growing,” he said.  The fund started investing in real estate in December as it
bought an office complex in London’s West End for 177 million
pounds ($273 million). It also bought a retail property in Paris
for 135 million euros ($176 million) and a shopping and business
center in Moscow for $133 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
