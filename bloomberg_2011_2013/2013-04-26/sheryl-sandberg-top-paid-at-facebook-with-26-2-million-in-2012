Facebook Inc. (FB)  Chief Operating
Officer Sheryl Sandberg received $26.2 million in compensation
last year, making her the highest paid executive at the world’s
largest social-networking service for a second straight year.  Sandberg’s compensation includes $25.6 million in stock
awards, salary of $321,128 and a $276,730 bonus, according to a
regulatory  filing  yesterday. Sandberg also topped the list for
2011, when her total compensation was about $40 million.  Facebook  shares  lost more than half their value from the
time of the May initial public offering through early September
amid concern that the company would struggle to make money from
the growing number of people who access the site from handheld
devices. The stock began rebounding as management reassured
investors that mobile-advertising efforts would pay off.  Total compensation for Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  was $1.99 million, though much of his wealth derives
from owning 425.6 million shares of Facebook, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Zuckerberg ranks No. 70 on the  Bloomberg
Billionaires Index .  Zuckerberg realized a gain of $2.28 billion when he
exercised a previously disclosed option to receive 60 million in
shares last year, according to the filing. He also sold just
over half of those shares in the IPO to cover related taxes.  Facebook rose 2.7 percent to $26.85 at the close yesterday.
The stock has climbed less than 1 percent this year.  ‘Monetization’ Progress  Zuckerberg received a bigger bonus in the second half of
the year. That “reflected his impact on our overall performance
in the period, including the growth of our user base and our
significant progress in mobile product development and
monetization,” according to the filing.  Sandberg’s bonus increased in the second half as well. That
“reflected her leadership in growing our revenue year over year
and her strategic guidance in various business matters,” the
company said.  Facebook also disclosed commercial agreements with
companies affiliated with its directors.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , whose CEO
Reed Hastings sits on the board, purchased $2.9 million in ads
from Facebook in the first quarter, compared with $7.9 million
in 2012, according to the filing.  Washington Post Co., run by Facebook director Don Graham,
bought $900,000 in ads in the period through March and $3.1
million last year, according to the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
