Aon Plc (AON) , the insurance broker that
moved its headquarters to  London  from  Chicago , declined the most
since May after a measure of revenue growth slowed.  Aon  slid  $2.29 or 3.7 percent, to $59 at 4:04 p.m. in New
York, the biggest drop on the 81-company Standard & Poor’s 500
Financials Index. The shares are up 6.1 percent this year.  Organic revenue growth, a measure of sales that excludes
acquisitions and currency fluctuations, was 2 percent in the
period, compared with 4 percent a year earlier, Aon said today
in a statement. Total revenue of $2.92 billion fell short of the
average estimate of $2.94 billion in a survey of analysts by
Bloomberg.  “We do not find the organic growth numbers particularly
encouraging,” Charles Sebaski, an analyst at BMO Capital
Markets, wrote today in a research note. “We would expect the
shares to trade flat to down.”  Aon is the second-largest insurance broker by market value.
No. 1 Marsh & McLennan Cos., based in  New York , slipped 0.7
percent to $37.33.  To contact the reporter on this story:
