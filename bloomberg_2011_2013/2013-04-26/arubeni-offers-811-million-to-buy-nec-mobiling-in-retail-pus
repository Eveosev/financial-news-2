Marubeni Corp. (8002)  offered to buy all
of  NEC Mobiling Ltd. (9430) , a mobile phone retailer, for 80.1 billion
yen ($811 million) as  Japan ’s biggest trader of grains and food
products expands outside commodities.  Marubeni will pay 5,510 yen for each of the 14.5 million
shares of NEC Mobiling, a company 51 percent controlled by
electronics maker  NEC Corp. (6701) , the Tokyo-based trading company
said today in an e-mailed statement. The offer opens on April 30
and closes on June 12, Marubeni said.  The addition will further ease Marubeni’s reliance on
metals and energy resources, which made up 49 percent of the
trader’s 172 billion yen in net income in the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2012. Commodity prices hit a nine-month low on April
18, according to the GSCI benchmark index. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. this week cut its near-term outlook on the asset class to
neutral from overweight.  NEC is reorganizing its operations to focus on corporate
services and selling assets as it plans to use loans to
strengthen its finances and make strategic investments. The
maker of La Vie computers has cut about 10,000 jobs and sold
assets including a stake in  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  last year.  NEC Mobiling runs 237 stores and 4 service centers, mainly
in Japan, and earned 5.89 billion yen in profit in the year to
March 31, up 20 percent on the previous 12 months, according its
website.  The outlook for Japan’s smartphone market is one of rapid
growth, according to Tokyo-based MM Research Institute Ltd. The
number of smartphone subscribers surged to 37 percent of all
contracts as of March 31 from 3 percent three years earlier, and
may jump to 58 percent in March 2015, the researcher said.  Global smartphone sales will probably rise 28 percent this
year to 836 million units, according to  IHS Inc. (IHS) ’s iSuppli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
