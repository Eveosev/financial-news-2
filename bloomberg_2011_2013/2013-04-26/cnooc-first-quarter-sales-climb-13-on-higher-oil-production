Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest
offshore energy explorer, posted a 13 percent gain in first-
quarter sales as higher output helped counter a slump in the
price of oil.  Sales rose to 55.3 billion  yuan  ($8.97 billion) in the
three months ended March 31, the Beijing-based company said in a
statement today. Output rose 17 percent from a year earlier to
93.6 million barrels of oil equivalent. Cnooc, which gets most
of its income from oil and gas production, didn’t report first-
quarter profit.  The company’s average realized oil price was $110.29, down
8.7 percent from the same period last year.  Cnooc has forecast a production increase of as much as 1.6
percent this year, down from 3.2 percent in 2012. Cnooc, which
completed the purchase of Nexen Inc. earlier this year, expects
the Canadian company to add 69.3 million barrels of oil
equivalent to its output this year.  The Chinese explorer’s shares have fallen 12 percent in
 Hong Kong  trading in the past year. That compares to a 8.4
percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index . Cnooc  fell  0.3
percent to close at HK$14.40 today. The earnings were announced
after the close of markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
