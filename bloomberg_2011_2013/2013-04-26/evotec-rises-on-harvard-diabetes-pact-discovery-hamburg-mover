Evotec AG (EVT)  rose for a third day as
researchers in its CureBeta pact said they discovered a hormone
that holds promise as a novel diabetes treatment.  Evotec  rose  as much as 7.2 percent and was trading 5.3
percent higher at 2.38 euros at 10:30 a.m. in  Frankfurt  today,
giving the Hamburg-based company a market value of 282 million
euros ($368 million). Evotec helps biotechnology companies and
drugmakers develop treatments.  Harvard University scientists discovered a hormone called
betatrophin that spurs the growth of beta cells, the body’s
insulin factories, according to research led by Douglas Melton,
co-director of the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative
Biology at Harvard in Cambridge,  Massachusetts . An almost-
identical hormone in humans seems to serve the same function,
Melton and his colleagues said yesterday in the journal  Cell .  “Thus, betatrophin treatment could augment or replace
insulin injections,” the researchers said in an abstract of
their research, possibly benefiting type 1 and type 2 diabetics.  Melton is part of the CureBeta initiative, set up in early
2011 by Evotec, Harvard and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
In July 2012,  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s Janssen unit licensed the
molecule.  Evotec has shifted its business focus to very early-stage
development, shuttling prospective treatments from academic
research to pharmaceutical companies, as well as offering drug-
development services, and no longer wants to find and market its
own products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
