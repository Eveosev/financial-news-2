Cortright McMeel , who drew on his work experience in commodities to craft a well-received novel about energy traders angling to make fortunes on terrorism fears and  weather forecasts , has died. He was 41.  He died on April 19 in Denver, his home since 2008, according to his wife, Sharon McMeel. She declined to give a cause.  A 1993 graduate of  Johns Hopkins University , McMeel was a senior energy trader in the Denver office of Rainbow Energy Marketing Corp., according to his Linkedin.com page. Rainbow Energy, based in Bismarck,  North Dakota , manages power and natural gas assets for clients in the U.S. and  Canada , and is a division of United Energy Corp., according to the unit’s  website .  His previous jobs included electricity trader for Constellation Energy Group in Baltimore.  In his darkly comic novel “Short,” published in 2010 by Thomas Dunne Books, McMeel conjured a fictional Boston firm, Allied Power, where energy traders place their bets around “a Formica gray tablet of Biblical proportion,” weighing such issues as “hurricanes, weather, gas draws, nuke plants coming online, nukes coming offline, coal barges and rail transport disruptions, transmission lines that caused price congestion between the hubs, and then again with the weather.”  “Predicting gas, oil and electricity futures was an easy job when you happened to be right,” he  wrote . “It was also easy when you were wrong: You got fired.”  Like ‘Goldfinger’  Though the novel was driven by the cast of characters and the lengths they were willing to go to influence events, McMeel included a glossary of trading terms as well as an explanatory note on what traders and brokers do.  The idea for the book “came while reading  Ian Fleming ’s ‘Goldfinger,’ a spy novel about a bad guy trying to corner another commodity market, gold,” the online publication New West quoted McMeel saying in a 2011  interview . “I was like, I could do this but with electricity trading.”  In a review for  Bloomberg News , James Pressley wrote: “McMeel sketches his crowd of misfits -- including a loudmouthed pig of a New York Mercantile Exchange broker wearing a Stetson -- in bold strokes and a harsh satirical light.” He said the author’s writing “crackles with authentic dialogue and noir humor.”  Unlike some of the whizzes in his book, “I am no genius trader,” New West quoted him saying. “In real life I’m like the shortstop who bats .260 and manages to hang in the big leagues.”  ‘Literary Sensibilities’  A true bibliophile, McMeel maintained a library of about 3,000 books and taught at Denver’s  Lighthouse Writers Workshop .  “He had a passion for so many things, it was hard to keep up with,” his wife said yesterday in an interview. “He was one of the most unique, brilliant, loving, giving people I’ve ever known.”  In 2006, McMeel founded  Murdaland , a journal featuring crime-fiction short stories. It was “a dark crime magazine with literary sensibilities,” he said, according to New West. Though only two issues were published, “Murdaland is something I’m very proud of,” he said. “This is the only good idea I ever came up with while sitting at a bar.” Baltimore’s City Paper called it the area’s best literary journal in 2007.  “Not all fiction exists to make you feel good,” McMeel said in 2007, according to  Johns Hopkins Magazine . “These stories are all about the outlaws, criminals, outcasts and life’s losers, and their struggles.”  No Journalist  Wallace Cortright Wetherill McMeel was born on May 14, 1971, in  Boston , the only child of J. Wallace McMeel, an ophthalmologist, and the former Elizabeth Wetherill.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in English from  Johns Hopkins  in Baltimore in 1993 and a master’s of fine arts in creative writing from  Columbia University  in New York in 1995.  “After Columbia I was too lazy to be a waiter and had too flimsy a grasp of the truth to be a journalist,” he told New West. So, he took a job in advertising, a “perfect fit,” he said.  From 1997 to 1999 he worked as an energy broker and trader with Cargill Inc., first in  New York  and then in  Minnesota , Sharon McMeel said. He was at  Constellation  from 1999 to 2008, and for Rainbow Energy since 2009.  His short stories were published in magazines including Mississippi Review, the Gettysburg Review, Chicago Quarterly Review and the New Guard Literary Review.  A boxer and rugby player who followed mixed martial arts, McMeel was finishing his next novel, “Cagefighter.” His wife said she will try to get it published.  McMeel had a son, Connor, and a daughter, Marlowe, with his wife, the former Sharon Zanoni, whose father, Ronald, served for 18 years as managing director at Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York.
