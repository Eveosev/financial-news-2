LeBron James scored 22 points and
the Miami Heat used a 30-8 second-half run to take control in a
104-91 win tonight at the  Milwaukee  Bucks that gave the
defending champions a three-games-to-none playoff series lead.  Miami can complete a first-round sweep in Game 4 of the
best-of-seven National Basketball Association series on April 28
in Milwaukee.  Ray Allen had 23 points for Miami, including five 3-
pointers -- setting an NBA postseason record with 322 shots made
beyond the 3-point line. The old record of 320 was held by
Reggie Miller.  The Heat trailed by two points at halftime and were behind
61-55 midway through the third period before going on their
decisive run, which lasted until early in the fourth quarter.  The Brooklyn Nets are playing tonight at the Chicago Bulls
with that series tied 1-1. The Los Angeles Clippers are seeking
a 3-0 advantage at the Memphis Grizzlies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
