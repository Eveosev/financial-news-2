U.S. stocks  rose for the week, with
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rebounding from the biggest drop
since November, as companies beat earnings estimates amid
speculation central bank stimulus will continue.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  fell on the final day as data showed the U.S.
economy grew less than forecast in the first quarter. United
Parcel Service Inc. and  Boeing (BA)  Co. climbed more than 3.2 percent
for the week after posting results. Apple Inc. rose 6.8 percent
after boosting its dividend and share-buyback plan. DuPont Co.
and Halliburton Co. jumped at least 7.5 percent, driving
commodity shares to the biggest gain among 10 S&P 500  groups .  The S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent to 1,582.24 over the five
days, after tumbling 2.1 percent in the previous week. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average increased 165.04 points, or 1.1
percent, to 14,712.55. The S&P 500 is up 0.8 percent in April,
poised for a sixth straight monthly gain, the longest stretch
since September 2009.  “We see a big pivot in markets to go from safe to
cyclical,” John Augustine, who helps manage $27 billion as
chief market strategist at Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp,
said by phone. “Earnings were OK. Now market attention is
focusing on stimulus, which they believe is coming in  Europe .”  Global stocks rallied during the week as speculation
mounted that the European Central Bank will cut rates when it
meets on May 2. U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.5
percent rate in the first quarter, below economists’ estimates
for a 3 percent gain. The economy’s inability to sustain faster
growth means Federal Reserve policy makers will probably affirm
a pledge to keep buying bonds after their May 1 meeting.  Economic Reports  Other economic reports in the week showed demand for
durable goods slumped by the most in seven months while
applications for unemployment benefits fell to a six-week low.  The  bull market  in U.S. equities has entered its fifth year
as the S&P 500 surged 134 percent from a 12-year low in 2009,
driven by better-than-estimated corporate earnings and three
rounds of monetary stimulus from the Fed.  Analysts are turning more bullish on corporate earnings.
Profit at S&P 500 companies gained 1.1 percent in the first
three months of the year, according to analysts’ projections
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a week earlier
projection for a decline of 1.1 percent.  Of the 270 companies in the benchmark index that have
reported so far in this earnings season, 74 percent have
 exceeded  analysts’ predictions on profits while 54 percent
trailed on sales, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Top Line  “It’s the trend we’ve seen for a while, which is,
companies seem to beat on earnings, but struggle on the top
line,” Rob Edel, chief investment officer with Nicola Wealth
Management, in a phone interview from  Vancouver . His firm
manages about C$2 billion ($1.97 billion). “It’s a question of
how much it is cost-saving driven versus real growth.”  The markets experienced two disruptions in separate
incidents during the week. The S&P 500 erased almost all of a 1
percent rally on April 23 following a post on an Associated
Press Twitter account that said there were explosions at the
White House. Stocks recovered as the AP said it had been hacked
and there were no explosions.  A software malfunction shut the Chicago Board Options
Exchange for three-and-a-half hours on April 25, preventing
traders from trading on options based on the S&P 500 and the so-
called VIX gauge of equity volatility.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index dropped
9.1 percent to 13.61 for the week. The gauge has lost 24 percent
for the year.  Commodities Rally  Companies whose earnings are most tied to economic swings
led gains for the week. Commodity, technology and financial
companies  rose the most  among 10 S&P 500 groups, rallying at
least 2.6 percent. The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities jumped
2.4 percent as gold rallied the most in 15 months and crude
capped its biggest increase since June.  The Dow Jones  Transportation Average (TRAN)  climbed 1.4 percent.
UPS advanced 3.3 percent to $85.71. First-quarter earnings beat
estimates as the world’s largest package-delivery company
carried more purchases to online shoppers.  Boeing jumped 5.6 percent to $92.85, the highest level in
more than five years. The company increased deliveries for 777-
and 737-model jets, making up for the halt in buyers picking up
Dreamliners while that plane was grounded and helping quarterly
profit exceed forecasts.  Apple Profit  Apple rallied 6.8 percent, the most since November, to
$417.21. The company, which this year ceded the title of the
world’s largest company by market value to Exxon Mobil Corp.,
said it will return an additional $55 billion in cash to
shareholders to compensate for a stock that’s been hammered by
signs of slowing growth.  The iPhone maker reported its first profit drop in a decade
and forecast sales this quarter that may miss analysts’
projections.  DuPont (DD)  advanced 7.5 percent to $52.90. The largest U.S.
chemical company by market value posted first-quarter earnings
that exceeded analysts’ estimates as profit from crop seeds and
pesticides hit a record and pigment demand began to recover.  Cost reductions helped quarterly results at Halliburton and
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. Halliburton, the world’s largest
provider of hydraulic-fracturing services, rose 9 percent to
$40.57. Cliffs Natural, the largest U.S. iron-ore producer,
gained 14 percent to $20.17.  Homebuilders Rally  An index of  homebuilders  jumped 14 percent. The Commerce
Department reported April 23 that sales of new U.S. homes
advanced in March as near record-low mortgage rates helped the
industry complete the strongest quarter since 2008.  Profits at D.R. Horton Inc. and PulteGroup Inc. surged amid
the accelerating housing recovery. D.R. Horton, the largest U.S.
homebuilder by volume, rallied 21 percent to $26.66. PulteGroup,
the biggest by revenue, climbed 19 percent to $21.35.  Netflix (NFLX)  Inc. soared 32 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$215.55. The online video service signed up more than 2 million
new U.S. customers and 1 million internationally in the first
quarter, defying skepticism about its growth prospects.  Microsoft (MSFT)  Corp., the world’s largest software maker, jumped
6.8 percent to $31.79 after activist investor ValueAct Holdings
LP amassed about a $1.9 billion stake.  Procter & Gamble Co. declined 5.3 percent to $77.10 for the
biggest retreat since 2009. The maker of Gillette razors and
Tide detergent projected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that
trailed analysts’ estimates because of currency fluctuations and
marketing costs.  AT&T Inc. slipped 3.2 percent to $37.04. The largest U.S.
phone company reported lower first-quarter revenue than analysts
forecast, dragged down by sluggish landline sales and
competition with Verizon Wireless.  Edwards Lifesciences (EW)  Corp. fell the most in the S&P 500,
plunging 23 percent to $64.17. The biggest maker of aortic heart
valves implanted with a catheter cut its 2013 forecast on
slower-than-anticipated sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
