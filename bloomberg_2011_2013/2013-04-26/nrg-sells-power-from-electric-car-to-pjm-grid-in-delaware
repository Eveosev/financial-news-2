  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) , the biggest power
provider to U.S. utilities, has sold power from an electric
vehicle to PJM Interconnection LLC’s grid in a collaboration
with the University of Delaware.  The project provides technology that enables owners of
electric vehicles to sell power back into the grid while
charging their batteries, according to a statement today. The
technology collects power from multiple plugged-in cars to
create a single electrical source rather than smaller individual
ones.  “The partnership between NRG and University of Delaware
perfectly illustrates the potential for research institutions to
spur economic development,” Governor Jack Markell said in the
statement.  The university and NRG began working on the so-called eV2g
project in September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
