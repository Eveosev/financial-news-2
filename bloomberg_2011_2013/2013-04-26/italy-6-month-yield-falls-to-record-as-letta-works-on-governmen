Italian six-month yields declined
to a record low at an auction of 8 billion euros ($10.4 billion)
of bills as Enrico Letta, deputy secretary of  Italy ’s biggest
political party, worked to form a government.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 8 billion euros of bills
maturing in October today at 0.503 percent, down from 0.831
percent at a March 26 auction. Investors bid for 1.4 times the
amount offered, down from 1.64 last month.  Letta met with political parties yesterday as he tried to
form a government backed by a Parliamentary majority able to
pass reforms and respond to the country’s longest recession in
over 20 years. Letta’s Democratic Party lacks enough members of
Parliament to govern alone.  Yields are also being pushed lower by expectations that the
European Central Bank will cut interest rates as European
economies show signs of slowdown.  Germany ’s  Ifo index  of
business confidence fell more than forecast earlier this week
and euro-area gauges of manufacturing and services activity for
April showed weakness in output.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped below 4 percent on April
22 for the first time since November 2010 and was up 4.1 basis
points to 4.1 percent after the sale at 11:16 a.m. in  Rome .  To contact the reporter on this story:
