The  New York  Rangers clinched a
National Hockey League playoff spot with a 4-3 overtime win
tonight at the Carolina Hurricanes after trailing by a goal with
less than three minutes remaining in the game.  Brad Richards scored his 11th goal of the season on a power
play with 2 minutes, 57 seconds left in the third period to tie
the game 3-3. Ryan Callahan scored his 15th goal of the season
2:55 into overtime for the victory.  The win gave the Rangers 54 points, making it impossible
for the ninth-place Winnipeg Jets to catch them for the final
Eastern Conference playoff spot.  The New York Islanders, who lost 2-1 tonight to the
Philadelphia Flyers, also have 54 points, and like the Rangers
have one regular-season game remaining.  The Ottawa Senators have 54 points as well after a 2-1
overtime win tonight at  Washington , and have two regular-season
games remaining.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
