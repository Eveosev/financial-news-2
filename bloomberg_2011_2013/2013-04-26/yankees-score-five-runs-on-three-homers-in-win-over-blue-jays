Vernon Wells, Robinson Cano and
 Francisco Cervelli  hit home runs to rally the New York Yankees
to a 5-3 Major League Baseball win against the Toronto Blue
Jays, whose manager was ejected.  Wells hit a solo home run in the second inning after Edwin Encarnacion smacked a two-run homer for the Blue Jays in the
first and Brett Lawrie added a solo home run in the second last
night to give the Blue Jays a 3-0 lead at Yankee Stadium.  Cano, who has seven home runs this season, hit a three-run
shot in the third and Cervelli homered in the fourth for the
Yankees (12-9).  “I think people who watch baseball are not surprised,”
Gardner said of Cano. “He’s a special hitter. He’s a special
player. He’s fun to play with.”  Hiroki Kuroda (3-1) allowed three runs on six hits in six
innings, while Mariano Rivera got his seventh save by striking
out two in a perfect ninth inning.  Mark Buehrle (1-1) surrendered five runs on seven hits in 5
1/3 innings for the Blue Jays (9-14).  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons was tossed from the game by
second base umpire Jeff Kellogg in the bottom of the seventh
inning for arguing a reversal of a call at first base that gave
New York’s Ben Francisco an infield hit.  Toronto manager John Gibbons was ejected in the seventh
inning after umpires overturned a call at first, giving Ben
Francisco an infield hit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
