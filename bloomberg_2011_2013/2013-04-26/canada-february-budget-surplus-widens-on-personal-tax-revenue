Canada â€™s  federal budget  surplus
widened in February on higher income from personal taxes and
reduced public debt charges.  The surplus increased to C$1.56 billion ($1.53 billion) in
February, from C$1.49 billion a year earlier, the finance
 department  said in a monthly report from Ottawa. The deficit in
the first 11 months of the fiscal year that ended March 31
narrowed to C$11.8 billion from C$12.6 billion a year earlier.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  projected last month the
deficit for the 2012-13 fiscal year will total C$25.9 billion.
Final budget figures are usually reported in the second half of
the year, when adjustments are made to reflect one-time factors
not included in monthly budget figures.  Revenue from personal income taxes rose 11 percent in
February, while employment insurance premiums were up 7.8
percent, helping to fuel a 2.4 percent gain in total revenue
during the month. Eleven-month revenue is up 2.3 percent.  Total expenses rose 2.2 percent, on a 5.5 percent decline
in public debt charges reflecting falling borrowing costs.
Eleven-month expenditures are up 1.8 percent, on a 6.1 percent
drop in debt charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
