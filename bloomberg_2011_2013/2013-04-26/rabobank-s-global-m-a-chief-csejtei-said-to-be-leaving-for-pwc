Rabobank Groep’s global head of
mergers and acquisitions, Istvan Csejtei, is leaving the Dutch
lender to join PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a person with
knowledge of the matter said.  The person asked not to be identified because the
information hasn’t been made public. Roelina Bolding, a
spokeswoman for Utrecht, Netherlands-based Rabobank, confirmed
that Csejtei is leaving while declining to comment on where he
is going. The bank is looking to replace him, she said.  Csejtei couldn’t be reached for comment. Mike Ascolese, a
spokesman for New York-based PricewaterhouseCoopers, declined to
comment.  Rabobank was formed in 1898 as a cooperative lender serving
Dutch farmers and has since become one of the world’s biggest
agricultural lenders. It’s also the Netherlands’ biggest
mortgage bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
