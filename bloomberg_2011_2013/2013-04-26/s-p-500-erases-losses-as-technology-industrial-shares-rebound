The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index
erased losses as technology, consumer-staples and industrial
shares rebounded from an earlier slump sparked by data showing
the economy grew less than economists forecast.  The  S&P 500  fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,584.76 at 3:12
p.m. in New York, after dropping as much as 0.5 percent earlier
in the day. Technology shares rose the most among 10 groups in
the index, with Hewlett-Packard Co. increasing 2.6 percent and
Apple Inc. adding 2.5 percent.  Equities slumped earlier as data showed the  U.S. economy 
grew less than forecast in the first quarter as a drop in
defense outlays undercut the biggest increase in consumer
spending in two years.  The S&P 500 has surged 134 percent from a 12-year low in
2009 as corporate earnings beat analyst estimates and the
Federal Reserve embarked on three rounds of bond purchases to
spur economic growth.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
