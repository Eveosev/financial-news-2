The Australian and New Zealand
dollars rose for a third day against the greenback on bets that
stimulus by the world’s major central banks will push money into
the South Pacific nations’ higher-yielding assets.  New Zealand’s kiwi dollar held a weekly gain against the
yen after the Bank of  Japan  reiterated its pledge to double the
monetary base in two years to end 15 years of deflation, without
announcing further steps. New Zealand’s currency gained for a
third day against its Australian counterpart after data showed
exports in the smaller nation rose more than forecast.
Australia’s bonds rose for the first time in three days.  “With the Bank of Japan, the Fed, the ECB to a degree, and
the Bank of England as well, all looking to step up easing
measures, it makes Australia and New Zealand quite attractive,”
said Janu Chan, a Sydney-based economist at St. George Bank
Ltd., referring to the Federal Reserve and European Central
Bank. “Money needs to go somewhere.”  The so-called Aussie rose 0.3 percent to $1.0321 as of 4:34
p.m. in Sydney, adding to a 0.3 percent gain over the past two
days. It dropped 0.3 percent to 101.89 yen.  The New Zealand dollar advanced 0.4 percent to 85.30 U.S.
cents after a 1.2 percent rise in the previous two sessions. It
declined 0.2 percent to 84.21 yen.  For the week,  Australia ’s currency has risen 0.4 percent
against the dollar and fallen 0.4 percent against the yen. The
kiwi has gained 1.3 percent versus the greenback and 0.5 percent
against the yen.  BOJ Meeting  The BOJ’s board met today for the first time since
announcing unprecedented monetary easing on April 4. It forecast
a so-called core inflation of 1.9 percent in fiscal 2015,
excluding sales tax effects.  The benchmark interest rate is as low as zero in Japan,
matching the U.S. That compares with 3 percent in Australia and
2.5 percent in New Zealand.  The New Zealand dollar has gained 6 percent over the past
six months, the best performer among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
Its Australian counterpart has risen 1.3 percent. The U.S.
dollar strengthened 1.9 percent. The yen has tumbled 20 percent,
the biggest drop on the indexes.  The kiwi rose for a third day against the Aussie as New
Zealand’s quarterly exports to  China  surpassed those to
Australia for the first time.  The total  value of shipments  rose to NZ$4.4 billion ($3.8
billion) in March from NZ$3.9 billion the previous month, the
statistics bureau reported today. Overseas sales to China jumped
32 percent, while those to Australia fell to a five-year low.  The  trade surplus  widened to NZ$718 million, compared with
the median economist estimate of a NZ$470 million surplus in a
Bloomberg News survey. New Zealand’s currency gained 0.2 percent
to NZ$1.2092 per Australian dollar, taking its advance this week
to 0.9 percent.  The yield on Australia’s 10-year government bond slid four
basis points to 3.16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
