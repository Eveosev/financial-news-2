NEC Corp. (6701) , a Japanese maker of
wireless base stations, will get 130 billion yen ($1.3 billion)
of financial support from lenders and sell its stake in a mobile
phone sales unit to  Marubeni Corp. (8002)   The financial support includes subordinated loans from
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., Development Bank of Japan Inc.
and three other lenders, it said in a  statement  today. The
company will sell its stake in  NEC Mobiling Ltd. (9430)  to Marubeni for
40.8 billion yen, it said.  NEC is reorganizing its operations to focus on corporate
services and selling assets as it plans to use todayâ€™s loans to
strengthen its finances and make strategic investments. The
maker of La Vie computers has cut about 10,000 jobs and sold
assets including a stake in  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  last year.  The company also said earnings would fall this year, with
net income to drop to 20 billion yen in the 12 months ending
March from 30.4 billion yen a year earlier. That compares
with the 53.2 billion-yen average of nine  analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of NEC fell 7.5 percent to 271 yen at the close of
trade in Tokyo, before the announcement was released. The stock
has gained 50 percent this year, compared with a 34 percent
advance for Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Chief Financial Officer Isamu Kawashima said the company is
experiencing little impact from a weaker yen.  Each one yen move against the  U.S. dollar  and euro affects
annual operating earnings by 300 million yen, he said.  In July, NEC built a common network system at  Asahi Group
Holdings Ltd. (2502) , maker of Super Dry beer, and in December it
formed a partnership with Interpol on cyber security. The
company teamed with Gutermann AG, a Swiss developer of leak-
detection technologies, to jointly develop water management for
cities, the two companies said Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
