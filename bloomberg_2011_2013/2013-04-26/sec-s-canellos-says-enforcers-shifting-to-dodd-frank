George Canellos, co-chief of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement division,
said investigators are turning their focus to enforcing new
regulations from the 2010 Dodd Frank Act.  “You’ll see a lot of our cases geared toward showing that
when new regulations are written that people must comply with
them,” said Canellos, who was speaking today on a panel at a
Practising Law Institute event in  New York . Enforcers play a
“critically important” role in shaping new rules, he said.  Canellos, who highlighted new regulations aimed to bring
transparency to the  derivatives market , said investigators are
pursuing issues such as the role of fiduciaries who are
responsible for setting up internal safeguards against fraud and
improper risk taking. The shift in focus comes as the agency
wraps up cases linked to the credit market turmoil of 2008, he
said.  Investigators are also trying to harness technology to
drive more data-driven cases, Canellos said. The agency is
looking for evidence of companies distorting their earnings
reports by comparing past performance records against analyst
estimates. A consistently close correlation could indicate
fraud, he said.  Canellos also said the agency will take “less of a one-
size-fits-all” approach to its cases, highlighting the “rich
variety of misconduct” that probes reveal.  “We shouldn’t be applying formulaic approaches to cases
that obscure critical differences that exist,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
