Petroleos Mexicanos , the world’s
fourth-largest oil producer, posted a first-quarter loss after
higher costs on employee benefits that are prompting pension
renegotiations with the union.  The net loss of 4.39 billion pesos ($361 million) for the
period compared with a 40.4 billion-peso profit a year earlier,
Mexico City-based Pemex, as the state-owned company is known,
said today in a  statement  to the Mexican Stock Exchange.  Chief Executive Officer Emilio Lozoya said April 16 Pemex
is negotiating with the union a revised pension system as the
reserve for employee benefits has surged more than 50 percent
since 2011 to 1.3 billion pesos this quarter under new
accounting standards from Mexican regulators.  Quarterly sales fell 3.7 percent to 396 billion pesos from
411 billion pesos a year earlier, while expenses climbed 8.4
percent to 203 billion pesos.  Pemex is in talks with the union to create a pension system
that is compatible with the nation’s regulated system known as
Afores, Chief Financial Officer Mario Beauregard said today on a
quarterly call with analysts. Management is proposing a system
of individual accounts that would be optional for workers and
apply to new employees, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
