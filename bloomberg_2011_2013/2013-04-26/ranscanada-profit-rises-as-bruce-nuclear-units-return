TransCanada Corp. (TRP) , builder of the
Keystone XL oil pipeline, said first-quarter profit increased as
the Bruce nuclear power plant units returned to service.  Net income rose to C$446 million ($437 million), or 52
cents a share, from C$352 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement on Marketwired
today. Excluding one-time items, per-share profit was below the
54-cent average of 13  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher output from Bruce Power in Ontario, the world’s
largest operating nuclear plant, is the “major driver” of
bigger profit expectations in the first quarter, Steven Paget, a
Calgary-based analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp., said in an
April 19 phone interview.  TransCanada owns 57,000 kilometers (35,000 miles) of
pipelines and more than 10,800 megawatts of power generation in
 North America . The company got 66 percent of its sales from
moving gas and oil along its pipeline systems last year, up from
54 percent in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company is awaiting a U.S. ruling it expects by mid-
year on the $5.3 billion northern leg of its Keystone XL line
proposed to bring crude from  Alberta ’s oil sands to the U.S.
Gulf Coast, Alex Pourbaix, president of energy and oil
pipelines, said last month.  The earnings were released before the start of regular
trading on North American markets. TransCanada, which has one
sell, seven buy and nine hold recommendations from  analysts ,
fell 0.3 percent to C$49.77 in Toronto yesterday. The shares
have declined 5.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
