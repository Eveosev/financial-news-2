J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY) , the U.K.’s third-
largest supermarket chain, said harvesting rainwater and fixing
leaks helped curb water use at its stores by half, the
equivalent of 393 Olympic-sized swimming pools a year.  Installing rain-harvesting containers and low-flush toilets
at stores and smart meters to identify water leaks to repair
helped Sainsbury save “hundreds of thousands” of pounds, Paul
Crewe, the London-based retailer’s head of sustainability,
energy and environment, said today in a website  statement.   A leak found and repaired at a Sainsbury store in Wigan
saved enough water a year to fill 21 Olympic pools. The company
said such measures cut operational water use by 50 percent since
2005.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  is the U.K.’s largest retailer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
