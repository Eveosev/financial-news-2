Max Clifford , a celebrity publicist
who has represented O.J. Simpson,  David Beckham  and Simon Cowell, was charged by U.K. prosecutors with committing 11
“indecent assaults” from 1966 to 1985.  The charges, which involve women and girls as young as 14,
stem from a police probe into historical claims of pedophilia
and sexual assault in the entertainment industry, the Crown
Prosecution Service said in a statement today. Clifford is
scheduled to appear in a London criminal court on May 28.  “There is sufficient evidence and it is in the public
interest for Mr. Clifford to be charged,” Alison Saunders, the
chief crown prosecutor for CPS, said in the statement.  Clifford was arrested in December by officers probing the
abuse of hundreds of children over almost 50 years by people
including the late British Broadcasting Corp. television star
Jimmy Savile, whose alleged actions triggered a scandal at the
world’s biggest broadcaster.  Clifford’s lawyer,  Charlotte Harris  of Mishcon de Reya in
London, didn’t immediately return a call for comment.  The probe was opened in October after broadcaster  ITV Plc (ITV) 
aired a story about Savile almost a year after his death at the
age of 84. Savile and the other suspects were involved in sexual
abuse on an “unprecedented scale,” police said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
