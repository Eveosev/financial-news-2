Gasoline slipped along with crude
as the  U.S. economy  grew less than expected in the first quarter
and traders cashed in on prices rising 3.4 percent in the past
two days. Crack spreads widened.  Futures fell as much as 0.9 percent. The fuel’s  premium 
over June West Texas Intermediate increased 5 cents to $24.46 a
barrel, while the  spread  versus Brent gained 9 cents to $14.73.
The Commerce Department reported gross domestic product rose 2.5
percent in the first quarter, below the 3 percent gain predicted
by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “There’s a little bit of profit-taking going on here, and
a little bit of concern over the GDP,” said Carl Larry,
president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “People
are trying to take profits and extend their weekends as the
weather’s getting warmer. Spring fever’s getting hot, everyone
wants to get out of the office.”  Gasoline for May delivery fell 0.55 cent to $2.8063 a
gallon at 10:01 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on
volume that was 46 percent above the 100-day average for the
time of day.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.7 cent to
$3.505 a gallon, AAA said on its website today. It’s the lowest
price since Feb. 1.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery gained 1.37 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $2.9154 a gallon on the Nymex. Trading volume
was 33 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus June West Texas Intermediate
crude gained 14 cents to $27.45 a barrel. The  spread  versus
Brent increased 20 cents to $17.74.  To contact the reporter on this story:
