The Federal Reserve said it will
conduct fixed-rate offerings of term deposits with a full
allotment of tenders under the central bank’s Term Deposit
Facility.  The program is part the small-value offerings announced on
Sept. 8, 2010, the Fed said in a  statement  today in  Washington .
The Fed Board had previously announced that it would consider
different formats for the facility.  “These small-value operations are designed to ensure the
operational readiness of the TDF and to provide eligible
institutions with an opportunity to gain familiarity with term
deposit procedures,” the Fed said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
