Idea Cellular Ltd. (IDEA) ,  India ’s second-
biggest mobile-phone operator by market value, climbed to the
highest level in more than five years in Mumbai trading after
reporting quarterly profit that beat analyst estimates.  Shares rose as much as 11 percent to 128.70 rupees, headed
for the highest price since January 2008. They traded at 125.25
rupees, or up 7.6 percent, as of 11:08 a.m. in Mumbai. The stock
had the second-biggest percentage gain today on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index. The key S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.4 percent.  Net income  rose 29 percent to 3.08 billion rupees ($56.8
million) in the fourth quarter ended March, the mobile-phone
operator said yesterday. That’s the highest profit it has posted
since the quarter ended June 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It also exceeded the 2.67 billion-rupee median of 26
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The earnings show that “market consolidation and
competitive improvement is happening rapidly,” Sunil Tirumalai
and Chunky Shah, analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a
note today and raised their rating to outperform from neutral.

result in revenue per minute upticks in coming quarters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
