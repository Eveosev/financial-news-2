Slovenia’s  economy , which is
grappling with a banking crisis, will probably shrink for a
second year in 2013 before returning to growth in 2014.  Gross domestic product will fall 1.9 percent this year,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of seven
economists, matching government and central bank forecasts. It
will rise 0.4 percent in 2014 and 1.5 percent in 2015, separate
surveys showed.  “Slovenia is in a difficult economic situation,” Prime
Minister Alenka Bratusek’s government said in an April 24
document on the parliament’s website. Banks need 900 million
euros ($1.2 billion) of fresh capital by July 31 and may require
more depending on how the economy fares, according to the
document.  The Adriatic nation, mired in its second recession since
2009, is preparing to sell benchmark bonds to recapitalize
lenders such as state-owned Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and
finance the budget. The export-driven economy shrank 2.3 percent
last year as demand for its goods in  Europe  ebbed and
consumption dropped because of government austerity.  Slovenia, which Moody’s Investors Service rates at Baa2, on
par with  Italy , is seeking to gauge U.S. investor interest in
its bonds after selling $2.25 billion of 10-year notes on the
American market in October with a 5.5 percent coupon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
