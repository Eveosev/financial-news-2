The  United Nations  delivered the
last set of Certified Emission Reduction credits eligible for
use in the so-called second phase of  Europe ’s carbon trading
market, the world’s largest.  The UN Clean Development Mechanism has supplied CERs
covering emissions totalling  1.3 billion metric tons  of carbon
dioxide equivalent since 2005, according to its website. The
next scheduled issuance is for May 1, the day after the deadline
for factories and power stations in the European Union to
surrender credits and EU permits matching their verified
emissions in 2012.  The European Commission, the bloc’s regulator, set a 1.4
billion-ton cap on the use of UN offsets to meet emissions
targets in the five years through 2012, known as Phase 2, and a
limit of almost 1.8 billion tons from 2008 through 2020.  The CERs, plus the  793 million tons  of so-called emission
reduction units issued under the UN’s Joint Implementation
offset program, means the supply of eligible credits today
exceeds the EU’s five-year limit by 57 percent, UN data show.
The surplus, along with an oversupply of permits issued by EU
member states, pushed prices for CERs to as low as  1 euro cent
($0.013) a metric ton  on April 24 on ICE Futures Europe
exchange. They were at 4 cents as of 1:18 p.m. in  London  today.  CERs and ERUs may also be purchased and used by governments
in developed countries that have to meet limits on their
emissions under the  Kyoto Protocol .  To contact the reporter on this story:
