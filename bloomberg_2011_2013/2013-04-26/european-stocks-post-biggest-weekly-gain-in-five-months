European stocks  posted the biggest
weekly gain in five months as investors speculated the region’s
central bank will cut rates and as companies from BASF SE to
 Standard Life (SL/)  Plc reported better-than-expected results.  BASF jumped 11 percent as the world’s biggest chemical
company posted first-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates.
Standard Life surged 16 percent. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA
climbed 9.8 percent after full-year profit beat forecasts. Royal
KPN NV slid 8 percent after it canceled its dividend for the
next two years and said it will sell new shares at a discount.  The benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose 3.7 percent to
295.89 this week, its biggest weekly advance since November. The
measure has rallied 5.8 percent so far this year as U.S.
lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget and optimism grew that
the world’s biggest economy is recovering.  “This week,  market psychology  has firmly bought into the
prospect of policy escalation,” said Graham Bishop, senior
equity strategist at Exane BNP Paribas in London. “Poor
economic data is simply reinforcing such expectations. We
maintain our view that liquidity strength trumps growth
weakness.”  Stocks climbed as investors speculated the  European Central
Bank  will cut its  interest rates  because of weakening economic
data in the euro area. The ECB holds its next interest-rate
setting meeting on May 2. Forty-three of 69 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey predicted that the central bank will lower
its benchmark rate to 0.5 percent from 0.75 percent.  Euro-Area Economy  A report on April 23 showed euro-area services and
manufacturing output shrank for a 15th month. The Markit
Economics purchasing-managers index was unchanged at 46.5 in
April from a month earlier. Numbers below 50 signal contraction.  German business confidence  fell for a second month in
April, a report showed this week. The Ifo institute in Munich
said April 24 its business climate index, based on a survey of
7,000 executives, dropped to 104.4 from 106.7 in March. The
median economist forecast in a Bloomberg News survey forecast a
decline to 106.2.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report on April 26
showed that the world’s biggest economy grew at a slower pace in
the first quarter than estimated. Gross domestic product rose at
a 2.5 percent annualized rate, compared with the 3 percent
economists had forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Chinese manufacturing expanded at a slower pace this month
than predicted, according to a release on April 23. The
preliminary PMI for April released by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit stood at 50.5, compared with a final 51.6 in March. That
was less than the average economist estimate of 51.5 in a
Bloomberg survey.  National Indexes  National benchmark indexes advanced in all the 18 western-
European markets this week. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 2.2
percent.  France ’s CAC 40 increased 4.3 percent and  Germany ’s  DAX
Index (DAX)  gained 4.8 percent.  Italy ’s FTSEMIB Index rallied 5.1 percent this week as
Giorgio Napolitano was elected as president for a second term.
Napolitano on April 24 named Enrico Letta as prime-minister
designate, following Italy’s inconclusive elections in February.  BASF jumped 11 percent after it reported first-quarter
earnings before interest, tax and one-time items increased 10
percent to 2.21 billion euros ($2.88 billion) as better-than-
predicted orders for herbicides and fungicides cushioned lower
demand for paper and pigment additives. The average estimate of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for 2.09 billion euros.  Standard Life  Standard Life rose 16 percent to the highest price since
 Scotland ’s biggest insurer became a listed company after it said
April 24 that long-term savings sales rose to 6.27 billion
pounds ($9.7 billion) in the first quarter, beating the 5.36
billion-pound average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Richemont gained 9.8 percent as the maker of Cartier
jewelry said in an unscheduled statement on April 23 that full-
year net income rose about 30 percent, beating the 25 percent
projected by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  climbed 17 percent. Europe’s second-
largest automaker reported first-quarter revenue fell 6.5
percent to 13 billion euros, beating the 12.7 billion-euro
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey, as delivery
growth in  China  and  Latin America  limited the decline.  The carmaker can proceed with the elimination of 11,200
jobs and a factory closing after a French court on April 26
threw out a legal challenge from two unions to the plan.  ARM Beats  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  surged 12 percent after the designer of
chips for Apple Inc.’s iPhone said April 23 that  first-quarter
revenue  rose 29 percent to 170.3 million pounds. That beat the
160 million-pound average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Royal KPN slid 8 percent after saying April 25 that it will
sell 2.84 billion new shares for 1.06 euros each in a rights
offer, a 62 percent discount to the previous day’s closing
price. The Dutch phone operator on April 23 canceled dividends
planned for 2013 and 2014.  Commerzbank AG tumbled 11 percent as the lender announced
