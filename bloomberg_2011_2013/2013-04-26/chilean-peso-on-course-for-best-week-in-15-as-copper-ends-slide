Chile’s peso headed for its biggest
weekly gain in three months, rebounding from the lowest level
this year as prices recovered for copper, the country’s biggest
export.  The currency has climbed 1.2 percent this week, the most
since the week ended Jan. 4. Today the peso gained for a fourth
straight day, appreciating 0.1 percent to 471.64 per dollar as
of 10:39 a.m. in Santiago. Copper futures prices in  New York 
have increased 1.7 percent this week.  The peso had fallen to 479.36 per dollar on April 23 amid
concern the central bank would intervene to weaken the currency
and as copper prices fell to an 18-month low. Peso volatility
fell 2.1 percent in the last three months, faster than any other
currency tracked by Bloomberg.  “Foreign banks have stopped selling pesos and the local
market is buying,” said Eugenio Cortes, the head of currency
forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago.
“The rise of the dollar was clearly on fear about the sharp
drop in copper prices and where it could end. As we got to 480
the market started shedding that fear.”  The dollar’s value in pesos on April 23 rose above the
upper 20-day Bollinger Band, a statistical indicator that the
peso’s value had fallen too far.  Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had a
$5.9 billion net bet against the peso on April 24, little
changed from April 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
