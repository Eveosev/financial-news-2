The number of gas rigs in the U.S.
fell for the first time in three weeks, declining by 13 to 366,
according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  increased by 10 to 1,381, data posted on Baker
Hughes’ website show.  Total energy rigs  slipped by four to
1,754, the Houston-based field-services company said.  The U.S.  gas rig count  has dropped to less than a fourth of
its peak of 1,606 in 2008 as energy producers abandoned natural-
gas plays to drill for more lucrative crude and natural-gas
liquids. The boom in tight-oil production helped the U.S. meet
84 percent of its energy needs last year, the most since 1991,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical unit.  ConocoPhillips (COP) , the largest independent U.S. oil and
natural gas producer, has no plans to start “redirecting any
capital toward gas assets until it’s significantly north of
current prices,” Matthew Fox, an executive vice president at
the Houston-based company, said in a conference call with
investors yesterday.  The company’s fuel production in  Texas ’ Eagle Ford shale
formation is about 60 percent oil, 20 percent natural gas
liquids and 20 percent dry gas, Jeff Sheets, Conoco’s chief
financial officer, said during the call. Its wells in  North
Dakota ’s Bakken formation produce mostly oil, he said.  Gas Stockpiles  U.S.  gas stockpiles  increased by 30 billion cubic feet to
1.734 trillion in the week ended April 19, the EIA said
yesterday. Supplies were 31.8 percent below a year earlier and
5.1 percent below the five-year average, down from a deficit of
4.2 percent the previous week.  Natural gas for May delivery fell 5.6 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $4.111 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:11 p.m. Futures have more than
doubled in the past year and have been trading above $4 for
three straight weeks.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  remains focused on liquids-rich drilling
and has “the flexibility and optionality” to ramp up gas
output should prices keep rising,  David Rosenthal , vice
president of  investor relations  for the Irving, Texas-based
company, said in a conference call with investors yesterday.  “We don’t tend to take the last two data points and draw a
trend line and react in that manner,” he said. “We tend to
have longer-term approaches to the development of all of our
resources.”  U.S.  oil output  reached 7.33 million barrels a day last
week, a two-decade high, EIA data show. Stockpiles climbed to
388.6 million, near a 22-year high.  Crude for June delivery on the Nymex fell 66 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $92.98 a barrel. Prices have decreased 11 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
