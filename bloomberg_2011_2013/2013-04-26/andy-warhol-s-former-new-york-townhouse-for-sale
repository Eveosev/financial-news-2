Looking for an artist's studio? Andy Warhol's former townhome doesn't exactly fit the starving artist profile. The home, located at  1342 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128  is priced at $5.795 million. However, for the Warhol admirer, the place may be the ultimate collector's item. According to the NY Times , the artist bought the home in 1959 for $60,000 and lived there for 15 years, sharing the  Carnegie Hill-area home  with his mother. It was during that time period that Warhol created some of his most iconic work, including the colorful renditions of Campbell's soup cans, dollar bills and comic strips. He used the main floor as his painting studio. Warhol leased the home to his business manager Frederick W. Hughes in 1974. In 1989, Hughes bought the home for $593,000 from the Warhol estate. The home has passed through two owners since then and underwent a small-scale renovation, which included new interior finishes, updated fixtures and a brand-new garden-level kitchen. The 3,072-square-foot  Manhattan townhouse  was originally built in 1889 and has 4 bedrooms — each with wood-burning fireplaces — 4.5 baths and a wood-paneled dining room.
