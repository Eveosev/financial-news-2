A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk held at a six-week low before a report on first-quarter
growth in the worldâ€™s largest economy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, was
unchanged at a mid-price of 79.1 basis points at 7:56 a.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The measure
yesterday fell to the lowest level since March 15.  U.S. gross domestic product probably rose at a 3 percent
annualized rate in the first three months of the year after
expanding at a 0.4 percent pace in the final quarter of 2012,
according to the median forecast of 86 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before an 8:30 a.m. report from the Commerce
Department. Signs of an improving economy may ease investor
concern that companies will struggle to repay their debts.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
