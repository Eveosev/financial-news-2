Gold may resume declines as soon as
next week, triggering a drop to about $1,150 an ounce, according
to technical analysis by Auerbach Grayson & Co.  The attached chart shows that gold has broken below its
trend line from the 2008 low and its 50-week moving average, and
went beneath the 200-week moving average for the first time in
11 years. A price rebound that saw it climb 12 percent since it
dropped to a two-year low of $1,321.95 in  London  on April 16
will probably end in a few days or weeks and selling should
resume, according to Richard Ross, global technical strategist
at the New York-based brokerage firm.  “Ultimately we see a decline down to $1,150,” Ross said
yesterday by e-mail. The target is near a 61.8 percent
retracement of the metal’s rise from the Sept. 12, 2008 close to
the Nov. 11, 2011 close, one of the levels singled out in so-
called Fibonacci analysis, he said. “Importantly, we must
consider further selling down to the magical round number at
$1,000.”  Gold entered a bear market on April 12, when it closed at
$1,483 as optimism that a U.S. recovery will curb the need for
stimulus cut demand for a protection of wealth. Gold traded at
$1,475.28 by 7:55 a.m. today in London, down 12 percent this
year.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is
based on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain
percentages after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
