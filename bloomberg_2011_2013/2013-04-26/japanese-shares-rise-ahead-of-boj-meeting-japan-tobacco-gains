Japanese shares fell, with the
 Topix Index (TPX)  retreating from a 4 1/2 year high, as earnings
reports from Shiseido Co. and  Advantest Corp. (6857)  disappointed
investors. The gauge extended declines after the  Bank of Japan 
repeated its pledge to double the monetary base in two years.  Shiseido Co.,  Japan ’s biggest cosmetics maker, tumbled the
most on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average after cutting its dividend
for the first time since listing. Advantest dropped 7.9 percent
after the maker of chip testers posted an unexpected loss on
falling computer demand.  Japan Tobacco (2914)  Inc.,  Asia ’s No.1 listed
cigarette maker, gained 2.7 percent after saying profit will
rise to a record this year on a weaker yen.  “We didn’t get anything new from the BOJ and that’s
exactly what was expected,” said Ichiro Yamada, who helps
oversee about 300 billion yen ($3 billion) in stocks as general
manager at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance in Tokyo. “Earnings so
far haven’t been quite as good as share prices would warrant
because best-case scenarios have been built in.”  The Topix Index lost 1 percent to close at 1,161.19 in
Tokyo. The gauge advanced 62 percent since mid-November through
yesterday, when it closed at its highest since September 2008,
as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and BOJ Governor  Haruhiko Kuroda 
pledged to beat deflation, and the central bank this month said
it would double bond purchases. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
lost 0.3 percent to 13,884.13 today.  Deflation Fight  Shares on the Topix trade at 1.3 times  book value  compared
with 2.3 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.7 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The BOJ kept its pledge to expand the monetary base and
predicted inflation will almost match its 2 percent target in
two years even after a report earlier highlighted deflation’s
grip. Consumer prices excluding fresh food slid 0.5 percent in
March from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said today.  Of the companies that have reported earnings so far this
month and for which Bloomberg has estimates, 98 companies have
beaten analyst projections and 87 have fallen short, according
to Bloomberg data.  Shiseido, Advantest and NEC Corp. posted the biggest
declines on the Nikkei 225 today. All but three of the 33 Topix
industry groups declined, with more than four stocks falling for
each that rose on the 1,698-member index.  Shiseido, the maker of toiletries and owner of U.S.
cosmetics brand Bare Escentuals, slumped 8.3 percent to 1,390
yen after reducing its planned dividend by 60 percent following
its first annual loss in eight years.  Advantest tumbled 7.9 percent to 1,412 yen, its biggest
drop since July last year, after posting a net loss of 3.8
billion yen versus a 333 million yen profit estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  NEC Corp. dropped 7.5 percent to 271, its sharpest drop
since May, after the Nikkei newspaper said operating profit at
the maker of  mainframe computers  will fall this year.  Cigarette Sales  Among stocks that rose, Japan Tobacco gained 2.7 percent to
3,595 yen to reach its highest ever. The cigarette maker
forecast 415 billion yen in net income this fiscal year, beating
the 412 billion yen average of 18 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg and its highest on record. The weaker yen is boosting
the value of overseas revenue, which accounted for about 48
percent of the company’s total in the last fiscal year.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 0.3 percent
to 25.72 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.4
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on
the gauge was 14 percent below its intraday 30-day average.  Markets will be closed on April 29 for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
