The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  fell 0.5 percent to settle at 622.29
at 3:41 p.m.  New York  time, led by industrial metals.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  gauge  of 26 prices declined 0.9
percent to 1,468.08.  BASE METALS  Copper dropped the most in a week on concern that growth in
the U.S. is slowing and stockpiles continued to expand before a
holiday that will close markets in  China , the world’s biggest
consumer.  Inventories tracked by the London Metal Exchange swelled
for a 13th week. Chinese markets will shut for three days
through May 1. Manufacturing gauges for the Asian nation and the
 euro zone  released this week were weaker than estimated by
analysts, while the U.S. economy grew at 2.5 percent, lower than
forecast, the government said today.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for July delivery
slid 1.7 percent to $3.186 a pound, the biggest drop for a most-
active contract since April 19, paring the weekly gain to 0.7
percent.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months retreated 2.1 percent to $7,030 a metric ton ($3.19 a
pound). Aluminum, tin, lead, nickel and zinc dropped.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures fell, trimming the biggest weekly gain in 15
months, as the U.S. economy expanded less than forecast, driving
commodities lower and crimping demand for the precious metal as
a hedge against inflation.  On the Comex, gold futures for June delivery declined 0.6
percent to $1,453.60 an ounce. Prices earlier rose as much as
1.6 percent, mainly on increased physical demand.  Silver futures for July delivery fell 1.6 percent to
$23.788 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery climbed 0.8 percent to $1,476.50 an ounce.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$681.95 an ounce.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil fell, trimming the biggest weekly increase since
June, as the  U.S. economy  grew less than expected in the first
quarter.  On the Nymex, oil futures dropped 0.7 percent to $93 a
barrel, paring the weekly gain to 5.7 percent, the biggest since
Jun 29.  Brent oil for June settlement slid 0.2 percent to $103.16 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Statoil ASA failed to sell North Sea Oseberg crude for a
second day. There were no bids or offers for Forties and Russian
Urals blend.  Nigeria will ship no cargoes of Bonny Light crude in June,
leaving a gap in its loading plans that will reduce the
country’s exports to the lowest in three years, people with
knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified as the
information is confidential.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline rebounded from an early drop, extending the first
weekly gain since March.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for May delivery climbed 0.8
percent to $2.8349 a gallon after falling as much as 0.9
percent.  Ultra low-sulfur diesel futures for May delivery slipped
less than 0.1 percent to $2.9012 a gallon.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas fell, capping the first weekly decline since
February, on speculation that fuel demand will slump after a
shot of unusually cold weather next week.  On the Nymex, gas futures for May delivery slid 0.4 percent
to $4.152 per million British thermal units.  U.K. gas for next month dropped 1.3 percent to 64.65 pence
a therm at 4:39 p.m. in London, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Orange juice  fell the most in five weeks on speculation
that rain in  Florida , the world’s second-biggest citrus grower,
will ease dry conditions.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, orange juice for July
delivery slid 3.1 percent to $1.3875 a pound, the biggest drop
since March 20.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery declined 2.5
percent to $1.3395 a pound.  Cocoa futures for July delivery advanced 0.2 percent to

cents a pound.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery gained 0.2 percent to

to plant a record crop amid forecasts for drier weather in the
Midwest.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for July
delivery dropped 0.8 percent to $6.1975 a bushel. Prices fell

percent.  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 1.6 percent to $6.925
a bushel.  Soybean futures climbed 0.6 percent to $13.81 a bushel.  LIVESTOCK  Hogs climbed to a three-week high on speculation that U.S.
demand for pork will increase as warmer weather sends people
outdoors for barbecues.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for June
settlement advanced 0.8 percent to 92.525 cents a pound, after
touching 92.55 cents, the highest for a most-active contract
since April 4.  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1.226
