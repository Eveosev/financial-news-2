Quintiles Transnational Holdings
Inc., the biggest provider of testing services to drugmakers,
filed to raise about $790 million in a U.S. initial public
offering.  The company and its shareholders, including TPG Capital and
Bain Capital LLC, are offering 19.7 million shares, equivalent
to about a 15 percent stake, for $36 to $40 apiece, according to
a regulatory filing today.  At the midpoint of the range, Quintiles would have a market
value of about $4.9 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It joins companies including ING U.S. Inc. that are
selling shares in the coming weeks after U.S. stocks have risen
to record levels and volatility in share prices has subsided.  The IPO would give Quintiles an enterprise value of about
$6.3 billion, or about 13 times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization in the 12 months through December,
according to filings and data compiled by Bloomberg. Private-
equity firms led by TPG and Bain bought Quintiles in 2008 in a
deal that valued the company at $3.8 billion, including debt, a
person familiar with the terms said in September.  Durham, North Carolina-based Quintiles was founded more
than three decades ago by Dennis B. Gillings, who serves as
executive chairman. Gillings and his affiliates are trimming
their stake to 20 percent from about 24 percent, the filing
shows. TPG and Bain each plan to offer 1.42 million shares,
reducing their holdings to 19 percent each, while  Singapore ’s
state-owned asset manager, Temasek Holdings Pte, is selling
about 600,000 shares and will own 8.2 percent of the company.  Repaying Debt  Quintiles itself is selling 13.8 million shares in the IPO,
while shareholders are offering 5.9 million. The company expects
about $489.8 million in proceeds from the IPO, which it will use
partly to repay borrowings, filings show, leaving about $2
billion of long-term debt.  Quintiles generated $4.87 billion of revenue in 2012, 12
percent more than in the previous year, and conducted business
in about 100 countries, filings show. Net income last year fell
27 percent to $176.6 million.  The biggest IPO in the U.S. so far this year was that of
Zoetis Inc., the animal-health company spun off by Pfizer Inc.
The company raised $2.57 billion including the overallotment
option. ING U.S., the American insurance unit of ING Groep NV,
is seeking to raise as much as $1.54 billion in an initial
offering on May 1, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Quintiles’s offering is scheduled for May 9, and the
company plans to list on the  New York  Stock Exchange under the
symbol Q. Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
are leading the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
