Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
note yields down the most in two weeks, as a report showing the
economy expanded less than forecast in the first quarter
sustained the refuge appeal of the world’s safest assets.  The benchmark  yields  fell toward the lowest level in more
than four months as another report showed  consumer confidence 
fell in April, a sign the economic slowdown extends into the
second quarter. Treasury  volatility  as measured by options rose
from a record low reached yesterday. The  Federal Reserve  meets
next week amid speculation it may taper its $85 billion monthly
asset purchase program.  “You need to see the economy really starting to do well
before you really start getting comfortable,” said Douglas Swanson, co-manager of a $29 billion fund at JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s J.P. Morgan Asset Management. As for the Fed, “even
though there’s been a lot of talk about tapering, you still feel
that’s not going to happen too early. With the economic numbers
that have come out more recently, that’s a lot less likely to
happen this year.”  Ten-year  yields  declined five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.66 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data, the biggest drop on a
closing basis since April 12. The yield reached 1.64 percent on
April 23, the lowest since Dec. 12. The price of the 2 percent
note due February 2023 rose 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face
amount, to 103 1/32.  Yields on the  30-year bond  fell four basis points to 2.86
percent.  Futures Traders  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  reversed 
from a net-short position to a net-long position in 30-year bond
futures in the week ending April 23, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 1,337 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the most in 2013. Last week, traders were net-
short 8,968 contracts.  In 10-year  note futures , speculative long positions
outnumbered short positions by 120,640 contracts, according to
CFTC data. Net-long positions fell by 14,732 contracts, or 11
percent, from a week earlier, according to the data.  ‘Aggressive Bernanke’  The Fed purchased $3.38 billion of debt maturing between
August 2020 and February 2023 today to support the economy by
putting downward pressure on borrowing costs, a policy known as
quantitative easing.  The current 10-year note accounted for 46 percent of
today’s Fed purchase in the seven- to 10-year sector, with its
purchase of $1.551 billion of the securities, according to Fed
data.  In the previous 14 operations in the sector since the
central bank’s third round of quantitative easing began Jan. 3,
the Fed has purchased the current 10-year note in six, taking $1
million to $3 million, according to Fed data.  Policy makers including Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  have said
they will maintain their $85 billion of monthly Treasury and
mortgage debt buying until the labor market improves
“significantly.” They meet for a two-day session ending May 1.  “Bernanke has been pretty consistent and he’s being more
aggressive than the market anticipates,” said Swanson, who
manages the  JPMorgan Core Bond Fund. (WOBDX)   GDP, Confidence  Gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annual rate,
lower than forecast, after a 0.4 percent fourth-quarter advance,
Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington . The
median estimate of 86 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a 3 percent gain.  “Investors aren’t convinced there’s any reason to
meaningfully sell off Treasuries at the moment,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at the broker-dealer BTIG LLC
in New York. “Growth remains less than desirable.”  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final April
index of  consumer sentiment  declined to 76.4 from 78.6 in March.
Economists projected 73.5 for the gauge after a preliminary
April reading of 72.3, according to another survey.  Treasury volatility as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE index  rose to 50.24 basis points, up from a record
low of 49.39 basis points reached yesterday, the fourth in as
many days as the Fed supports the market with asset buying. The
data, which measures price swings, stretches back to 1988.  Auction Demand  Demand picked up this week as the U.S. auctioned $99
billion in notes, including $29 billion in seven-year notes
yesterday that attracted the highest demand this year. The notes
were sold at a  yield  of 1.155 percent, compared with a forecast
of 1.163 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine of the Fed’s
primary dealers.  Even with the recent pickup, bidding at Treasury auctions
this year has slowed versus 2012, with the $721 billion in debt
sales attracting an average of $3.01 in orders to buy per dollar
of debt sold, compared with a record $3.15 the previous year,
data released by the Treasury and compiled by Bloomberg show.  The sales this week raise $59.05 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $57.95 billion,
according to the  U.S. Treasury .  To contact the reporter on this story:
