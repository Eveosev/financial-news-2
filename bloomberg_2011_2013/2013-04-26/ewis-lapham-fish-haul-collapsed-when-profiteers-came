In the middle of the 19th century,
with the whaling industry in decline, small, bony menhaden leapt
into prominence.  (To listen to the podcast, click here.)  The  fish oil  could be used to dress leather, mix into
paint, light lamps, and soon technological advances, such as
purse seines and steam extraction, attracted investors. By 1876,
factories in  Maine  were processing 709,000 barrels of menhaden
annually, at 200 fish to the barrel.  Locals protested the destruction of their livelihoods
through industrial overfishing by outsiders. The large, well-organized companies countered that there was an inexhaustible
supply of menhaden, and exploiting them added to the wealth of
the country.  In 1879, the abundant menhaden schools failed to appear in
the Gulf of Maine, and only 20,000 pounds were caught, compared
to the million pounds of the previous year.  According to W. Jeffrey Bolster, author of “The Mortal
Sea: Fishing the Atlantic in the Age of Sail,” we’ve been
having the same conversation between ocean harvesters and
conservators ever since.  We spoke on the following topics:  1. Bountiful Waters  2. Man’s Early Impact  3. Collapse of Fishing Grounds  4. Small Fish, Big Fish  5.
