The U.K. government asked courts to
punish two men who used Twitter Inc. and  Facebook Inc. (FB)  to
publish photographs of the killers of Liverpool toddler James
Bulger.  Dean Liddle and Neil Harkins posted photographs claiming to
identify Jon Venables and  Robert Thompson  on the social media
sites, which were “shared hundreds if not thousands of times,”
breaching an order in effect since 2001, lawyers representing
the U.K. Attorney General Dominic Grieve, said in court
documents filed in London.  The murder of Bulger in 1993 was one of the most notorious
in British history as Venables and Thompson were 10 when they
abducted and killed the two-year-old. The pair were released
from jail in 2001. The case triggered public protests and their
identities were changed to protect them from reprisals.  “The level of animosity towards Thompson and Venables has
not diminished,” Melanie Cumberland, a lawyer for the
government, said in court today. Grieve is looking into bringing
further prosecutions against other individuals, she said.  Lawyers for Liddle and Harkins said in court their clients
admitted posting the material. The maximum penalty for contempt
of court is two years in prison, lawyers for the government
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
