The automatic federal spending cuts
known as sequestration won’t force the State Department to
furlough any employees this year.  The State Department is notifying its staff today that new
projections show “furloughs are not required” during the year
that ends Sept. 30 “due to cost-cutting measures implemented
early in the  fiscal year  and a reduction in the sequester cut”
identified by the Office of Management and Budget, the
department said today in response to an inquiry.  Sequestration reduces all accounts across-the-board, and 80
percent of the cuts in foreign assistance will be borne by
programs to support foreign military financing, global health,
and economic and humanitarian assistance, according to the
department.  Additional funding that Congress provided in the full-year
continuing resolution for some programs, such as humanitarian
assistance, will reduce, though not eliminate, the effects of
sequestration.  “We are still assessing the specific impacts,” according
to the department’s response. “It will mean that we will be
able to do less than we would have if we did not face this
across-the-board cut.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
