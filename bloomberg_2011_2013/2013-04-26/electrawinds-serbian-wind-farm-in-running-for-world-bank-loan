Electrawinds SE (EWI) ’s Serbian wind farm
is being considered by the World Bank’s International Finance
Corp. for an award of 59.2 million euros ($77 million) of loans
to help the nation curb power shortages and reliance on coal.  The Belgian renewable energy company is working on Alibunar
in Vojvodina province, northeast  Serbia , according to documents
on Washington-based IFC’s website. The 42-megawatt plant will
cost 80 million euros and use 21 turbines, they showed.  Serbia, relying on coal for  62 percent  of its power, plans
to stop energy shortages that pushed up generation costs. The
Balkan nation, which doesn’t have any operating wind energy, in
February revised clean power incentives to spur 1,092 megawatts
of renewables including wind, hydro and biomass by 2020.  IFC’s proposed investment comprises a 16 million-euro loan,
a syndicated 39.2 million-euro loan and 4 million-euro non-
convertible subordinated loan, according to the lender.  Electrawinds will supply 20.8 million euros of equity and a
commercial bank will provide a so-called VAT facility, the IFC
said. The investment is pending an IFC board review on May 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
