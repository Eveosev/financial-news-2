SunPower Corp. (SPWR)  and MidAmerican
Energy Holdings Co. began construction in January on a 579-
megawatt solar development in California.  The two Antelope Valley solar farms, in  Los Angeles  and
Kern counties, are expected to be complete by the end of 2015,
MidAmerican said today in a statement. They will provide enough
power for 400,000 California homes and will sell electricity to
 Edison International (EIX) â€™s Southern California Edison utility under
long-term contracts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
