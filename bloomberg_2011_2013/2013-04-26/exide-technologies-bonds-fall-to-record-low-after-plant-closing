Bonds of  Exide Technologies (XIDE) , a
lead-acid battery producer, plunged to the lowest level ever
after California regulators ordered it to close a recycling unit
because of health risks.  The company’s $674.2 million of 8.625 percent, first-lien
notes due February 2018 dropped 4 cents on the dollar to 65
cents to yield 20.5 percent at 2:43 p.m. in New York, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities have fallen 14.3
cents since April 23.  The California Department of Toxic Substances and Control
ordered the company to suspend operations at its Vernon,
California, plant on April 24, alleging that the facility isn’t
in compliance with the state’s health risk standards, the
company said yesterday in a regulatory filing.  Exide hired  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  to advise it on financing
alternatives and restructuring activities, the Milton, Georgia-
based company said in an April 4 statement.  The company has $730 million of debt, including a $56
million convertible due Sept. 18, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It had $80 million in  cash  and cash equivalents on
Dec. 31 and paid $71.8 million in interest expense last year,
when it reported net income of $56.7 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
