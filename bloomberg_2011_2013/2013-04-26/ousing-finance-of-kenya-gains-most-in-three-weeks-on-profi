Housing Finance Ltd.,  Kenya ’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, gained the most in more than
three weeks after saying profit jumped in the first quarter.  The shares advanced as much as 7.2 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since April 2, before trading 3.1 percent
stronger at 25 shillings by 1:57 p.m. in Nairobi, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. About 2.7 times the three-month
daily average of shares were traded.  Net income rose to 195 million shillings ($2.3 million)
from 133 million shillings a year earlier, Housing Finance said
yesterday. Net interest income, the money earned from interest
charges on loans, rose to 665 million shillings from 456 million
shillings.  The company “may seek additional funding in the fourth
quarter of the year to further capitalize Kenya Building
Society,” Managing Director Frank Ireri said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. The society, a Housing Finance unit,
constructs homes in  East Africa ’s biggest economy. “Following
recent peaceful national elections, we expect sustained growth
during the year,” Ireri said.  Uhuru Kenyatta withstood a court challenge from  Raila
Odinga  of his March 4 presidential election victory and was
sworn into office earlier this month. A disputed vote in 2007
left at least 1,100 people dead and displaced 350,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
