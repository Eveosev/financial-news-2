Switzerland ’s  KOF economic
indicator  rose in April after five months of declines,
suggesting the economic momentum may pick up.  The monthly gauge, which aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months ahead, rose to 1.02 from a revised
1.00 in March, the KOF Swiss Economic Institute in Zurich said
in an e-mailed statement today. Economists forecast a reading of
0.98, the  median  of 14 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Switzerland’s economy may growth as much as 1.5 percent
this year, the  Swiss National Bank  said in its most recent
forecast. The franc remains highly valued and a further rise in
the currency would have severe consequences for the economy, SNB
Board Member Fritz Zurbruegg said last week. The SNB set a cap
of 1.20 per euro on the franc in September 2011 to shield it
from the economic turmoil in the euro area.  The April data “confirms the initial stabilization,”
which already was indicated the previous month, KOF said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
