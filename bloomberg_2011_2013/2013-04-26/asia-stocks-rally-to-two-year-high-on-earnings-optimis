Asian  stocks  rose this week, with
the regional benchmark index heading for the biggest monthly
gain this year, as companies including  BYD Co. (1211)  and Kobe Steel
Ltd. forecast profit increases.  BYD, the Chinese automaker partially owned by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., jumped 16 percent in  Hong
Kong  after saying first-half earnings will surge. Kobe Steel
Ltd.,  Japan ’s third-biggest steelmaker, rose 17 percent in  Tokyo 
trading after it forecast its first profit in three years.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd.,  Australia ’s second-largest oil producer,
added 13 percent after announcing plans to return cash to
shareholders.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index added 4 percent to 140.33 this
week, touching its highest level since May 2011 on Thursday. The
index is headed for a 4.6 percent gain in April, its largest
monthly jump this year. The Topix Index added 3.1 percent in
Tokyo as the  Bank of Japan  reiterated a pledge to double the
country’s monetary base in two years.  “My feeling is that Asia may start looking healthier going
forward, and profit results look OK,” said  Shane Oliver ,
Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which has $126 billion under management.
“Investors are giving Japan the benefit of the doubt. If it’s a
good profit or economic figure, investors say it’s good. And if
it’s a bad one, they say it doesn’t matter because the BOJ is
doing stimulus.”  Policy Optimism  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 8.5 percent this year
through April 26 amid optimism Japan will deploy more measures
to beat deflation and that policy makers in the U.S. and  China 
remain on standby to support growth. The Asian benchmark traded
at 14.18 times estimated earnings, compared with 14.35 times for
the S&P 500 and 12.84 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 4.3 percent, rising
to its highest level since June 20, 2008. The BOJ on April 26
reiterated its commitment to double the country’s monetary base
in two years, adding as much as 70 trillion yen ($710 billion) a
year to the amount of money circulating in the economy.  Consumer prices, excluding the impact of a sales-tax
increase and volatile fresh food costs, will rise 1.9 percent in
the fiscal year starting in April 2015, according to the median
estimate of BOJ board members published yesterday.  Australia Gains  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index, which was closed for a
public holiday on Thursday, rallied 3.4 percent this week, the
most since Dec. 2, 2011.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index gained 2
percent. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  added 2.4 percent. Taiwan’s
Taiex Index advanced 1.2 percent.  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 3 percent on concern
slowing growth will hurt earnings, dragging the benchmark index
to a third straight monthly loss. Mainland markets will be
closed through May 1.  Of the 883 companies on the Asia-Pacific gauge that have
reported  quarterly earnings  this month, and for which Bloomberg
has estimates, more than half have missed projections.  Every  group  on the gauge increased during the week, led by
consumer discretionary companies and materials producers.  BYD gained 16 percent this week to HK$28.15, the biggest
jump since November, after the maker of the E6 electric car said
it may earn first-half net income of 400 million  yuan  ($65
million) to 500 million yuan, up from 16.3 million yuan a year
earlier, according to a filing to Shenzhen’s stock exchange
April 25. First-quarter profit soared 316 percent to 112.4
million yuan as sales increased 9.8 percent to 12.9 billion yuan.  Kobe Steel Surges  Kobe Steel surged 17 percent to 131 yen this week, its
biggest weekly gain since Dec. 21, after it forecast a profit of
35 billion yen ($357 million) in the year started April 1,
beating the 8 billion yen average estimate of 15 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg news. Cost cuts, combined with demand for
automotive steel in  North America  and China will help support
earnings growth, according to a statement filed yesterday by the
company.  Woodside Petroleum jumped 13 percent to A$38.45 this week,
its highest level since July 22, 2011. The company announced it
will return about $520 million to investors in dividends after
dropping plans to build a liquefied natural gas project
estimated to cost $45 billion.  Nippon Paper Industries Co. gained the most in the regional
benchmark index this week, surging 21 percent to a record high
of 1,478 yen this week after boosting its net income outlook for
the year ended March 31 by 75 percent to 10.5 billion yen.  Among stocks that fell,  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , owner of
the reactors at the center of the 2011 Japanese nuclear disaster,
dropped 11 percent this week, the most in almost a year. TBS
News reported it may post a pretax full year loss of 380 billion
yen, citing an unnamed person on April 26. The company will
report earnings April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
