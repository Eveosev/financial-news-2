Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) ’s
talks with South Africa about a restructure that could result in
as many as 14,000 job cuts are taking place in a “difficult
environment,” Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith said.  “This is a very, very tough time for everyone, to try to
make a profit in this kind of environment and then it’s a
difficult time for governments to keep economies turning over
and to keep people employed,” he said in an interview in
Johannesburg today.  Producers in South Africa, which has the world’s largest
known reserves of platinum, are struggling with higher costs
after strikes led to above-inflation wage gains, while demand
wanes. Amplats, as the company is known, in January said it
proposed to cut 400,000 ounces of platinum production annually,
or 7 percent of global output, to help return to profitability.  Amplats put the plans on hold for 60 days for talks after
the government criticized its handling of the matter and
threatened to revoke some mining licenses.  Griffith declined to elaborate on the status of the
negotiations, which are due to end on April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
