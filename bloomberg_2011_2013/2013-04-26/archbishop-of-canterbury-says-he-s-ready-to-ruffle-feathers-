The Archbishop of Canterbury,
Justin Welby, said he is prepared to “ruffle feathers” in his
new role, days after saying the U.K. was in a depression and
calling for the break-up of at least one large bank.  In an  interview  with BBC Radio 4’s “The Week in
Westminster,” Welby said that while he hadn’t had any
complaints from the government about his April 23 comments,
“they probably would have preferred it not said.”  “Do I mind ruffling feathers?” he said. “I think I do
mind ruffling feathers, I don’t like ruffling feathers. But
sometimes feathers get ruffled. I mean, that’s life.”  Even as data published on April 25 indicated  U.K. economic
activity  rose more than expected in the first quarter, Welby
said “we are still significantly  below where we were  in 2007.”  Welby, a former oil executive inaugurated as head of the
Anglican church on March 21, said Britain’s finance industry was
“so important and so full of very gifted people” that “how
that behaves in relation to the common good is very key.”  The archbishop called for oversight of the banking industry
by a professional body and an exam system for people who wish to
work in it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
