Senator Angus King, a Maine
independent who caucuses with Democrats, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,”
airing this weekend, that the U.S. must be “really careful” in
determining its response to evidence from intelligence agencies
that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime may have used
chemical weapons.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

Maine. Thank you for being here today, Senator.  SENATOR ANGUS KING: Al, what a pleasure.  HUNT: Senator, you gave your maiden speech in the Senate
this week. You quoted Lincoln and Madison, even Billy Mays, but
it really talked about the - the trade-off between the
desirability of checks and balances versus the perils of
gridlock. It looks to most in  Washington  like the latter is
dominant, yet you told the Bangor Daily News a few weeks ago
you’re optimistic. Why?  KING: Well, there are little - little sort of green shoots.
I must say, my optimism rises and falls. Right now I’m at a bit
of a low ebb because this past week we’ve had this thing with
the - with the Marketplace Fairness Act where a very small group
of senators has held things up for - for quite a bit of time.
But immigration, bipartisan, eight senators. Now it remains to
be seen whether we’re going to be able to pull it off -  HUNT: But that looks promising. Anything else?  KING: Well, we lost on the - on the background checks, but
 Pat Toomey  stepped up. We just didn’t get enough Republican
votes on that. But there - there are some discussions. And what
I’m finding, it’s very interesting, Al. Because I came down
there. You hear all the stuff about the poisonous atmosphere and
the partisanship. What I’ve observed is the Senate is very
partisan institutionally, but personally it isn’t. It isn’t a
poisonous atmosphere personally. There are a lot of
relationships. And I get the feeling that people want to be a
little more cooperative and work together, particularly at the
committee level. But the institution is always pulling us apart.  HUNT: Well, let’s talk about some of the issues that you
care about. You’re on the Budget Committee. The president
submitted his budget a few weeks ago. Did it go far enough on
entitlements?  KING: I think we’re going to - that remains to be seen. I
think it’s - it’s going to be - it’s a question of whether the
Republicans will say yes. They - the - the question I have is
are they really interested in debts and deficit or are they - or
is the agenda really just to shrink government?  HUNT: Well, you’re an independent who caucuses with the
Democrats, but you have those personal relationships already
with some Republicans. Do any of them tell you that they might
be willing to go along with taxes if - if the - if entitlements
are on the table?  KING: What I’ve heard informally is if there are - it would
be a marriage of the Senate budget and the House budget. The
House - the Ryan budget, interestingly, raises a lot of new
revenues, but it turns around and gives it all back in the form
of very large tax cuts. The Senate raises revenues, not as much,
from tax expenditures, loopholes and deductions. They put it all
toward deficit reduction. To me, as an old deal maker, the deal
is, OK, let’s compromise between those two. Have - have some tax
reduction and some deficit reduction from new -  (CROSSTALK)  KING: I think it’s possible.  HUNT: You do? Better than 50/50?  KING: I don’t know if I’d put it - I’d put it at 50/50. So
much - so much depends on who’s in the room. And - and again, it
depends on what their real motivation is going into the room. If
the motivation is to make political points and long term, then
we’re not going to get it.  HUNT: Let’s talk about a shorter-term issue, the
sequestration which almost no one likes. You’ve talked about the
bad effects it has on some domestic programs and military
programs.  KING: And military.  HUNT: Big clamor now. Let’s do something about the FAA and
air traffic controllers. That inconveniences people. That’s part
of it, but should you carve that out and not do something at the
same time about military, at-risk kids and all the other things
affected by sequestration?  KING: I don’t think so. I think - I think the sequestration
is terrible. It was designed to be stupid and it is. And yet
here we are and everybody’s wringing their hands about it but
nobody really wants to step forward. The Senate put forward a
proposal. The House put forward a proposal, but neither went
anywhere. But the idea - the idea of carving out and saying we
can’t do air traffic controllers but it’s OK to lay off - to
quit doing Meals on Wheels or lay off Head Start workers, or
four out of six air squadrons in  Europe  are grounded. There -
there are some very serious consequences going on. And to just
fix the air traffic controllers it seems to me is just - it
doesn’t - it makes it even less sensible.  HUNT: Senator, I can see what a bargaining chip you had
back in January by looking at the committees you’re on. As well
as budget, you’re also on intelligence and armed services.  KING: Putting me on intelligence was  Harry Reid ’s idea of a
sense of humor I think.  HUNT: Well, let me ask you about that. From what you’ve
been told, are there any - do you have any concerns about the
way the U.S. agencies handled the treatment of that suspected
 Boston  Marathon -  KING: I only have one question, and that is when and how
was the decision made to - to Miranda him. They were
interrogating him. The FBI interrogated him for 16 hours. They -
they got information. The magistrate came in. They gave him his
Miranda rights, and my understanding is he’s not talking
anymore. Now I don’t think you can hold somebody indefinitely.
They were doing it under the public-safety exception that says
they wanted to find out if there were other conspirators. This
guy’s an American citizen. Fifth Amendment, due process means
something. And these people that are saying, well let’s call him
an enemy combatant and just put him away forever, I - I - as a
person that believes in the Constitution, I have a real problem
with that.  HUNT: On the Intelligence Committee, are you convinced that
 Syria  used chemical weapons and there’s persuasive evidence of
that?  KING: Convinced is too strong a word. The - I think the -
we heard today from  John Kerry  there is some evidence that it
was used. It’s hard to tell exactly. It appears at a minor
level, not - not a lot, not a large usage. And we got to be
really careful with this. We got to be sure that it really is
the regime and not the opposition that is planting evidence in
order to draw us in. This is - these are very serious
consequences.  HUNT: If we do find that there was chemical weapons used,
the administration has said that’s a red line. They’ve drawn a
red line there. What should be the U.S. response?  KING: Well, that - that’s - there are so many different
options, and there is no - I can tell you there’s no good
option, at least that I’ve seen. This is -  HUNT: Do you worry about arming the opposition?  KING: I do, because we don’t know who they are. We’ve
already had the experience in  Afghanistan  of arming the
opposition and then having those arms used against us five or 10
years later. So I think that’s a - and what I’m hearing is that
the opposition is armed and they’re getting arms from other
people. They don’t necessarily have to get arms from us. But I
think, frankly, one of the most important things we could do is
humanitarian aid. But this’ll amaze you, Al. The fourth largest
city in  Jordan  today is the refugee camp. And that’s a
tinderbox. We’ve got to help them with that.  HUNT: Is there an equal danger of drawing a red line and
then not doing anything?  KING: Of course there is. And - and - but I think if you’re
going to draw a red line, you’d better be sure it’s crossed
before you start doing anything significant. But the other
problem is the opposition wins. We all want Assad out. The
opposition wins and the country fragments. Then who’s going to
get control of those chemical weapons? The - ideally if we can
say, OK, we’re going to drop in the paratroopers, we’re going to
secure the chemical weapons, but every military person I’ve
talked to says there’s no such thing as a surgical strike.  HUNT: Let me ask you, from what you - you’ve looked at
another issue in your committees, drones. Are - is the U.S.
drone policy killing more terrorists or is it creating more
terrorists?  KING: That’s a - that’s - that’s the dilemma. I saw a story
last night of a guy from  Yemen  who basically said the drones
radicalized his village, and they were always pro-American.
That’s a tough call because the drone program has been very
effective in essentially decimating al-Qaeda. And I got in
trouble on television a couple of months ago by saying it was a
more civilized form of - of combat than shelling a whole city.
You can look at the pictures of Atlanta after Sherman and there
was nothing left. If you can take out that - that enemy
combatant who’s planning these attacks against the US, that’s
OK.  I’ll tell you, Al, I think the bigger issue with drones is
coming, and it’s going to be local. Every police force in
America is going to want drones for surveillance.  HUNT: Not armed drones.  KING: Not armed, but for surveillance.  HUNT: Well let me stay on armed drones for a second.  KING: They now have drones that looks like hummingbirds.
They hang right outside your kitchen window.  HUNT: But has the Obama administration, I’m talked about
armed drones now, the killing drones, have they been
sufficiently open, transparent with Congress and the public?  KING: Well, I - I don’t think they’ve been fully
transparent with the public because parts of it are classified.  HUNT: How about with Congress?  KING: I think they’ve been pretty forthcoming with
Congress. Not the entire Congress perhaps, but the intelligence
committees, the leadership. And - and to their credit, they have
gone pretty far in developing what amounts to a playbook about
what’s the checklist before you can do this. And it’s - it’s a -
basically this is uncharted territory. This is a new weapon. And
- and I don’t think we can say we’re never going to - everybody
gets the creeps from drones. There’s just something about it
that we just don’t like. But on the other hand, it can be a very
effective weapon if deployed. And I think there’s no question
it’s had a lot to do with the very strong taking out of the
leadership of al-Qaeda.  Now here’s the problem. I asked one of the witnesses in the
hearing, I said, you must feel like you’re dealing with the
hydra. Remember the hydra? Cut off the head, two grow back.
That’s the problem that we have. And I think we got to talk
about what is causing these people to be radicalized and how do
we - how do we deal with that. Because this -this organization
and these terrorist organizations are just metastasizing. And
two guys in Boston pop up. That’s - that’s a real concern.  HUNT: Senator Angus King of  Maine , thank you so much for
being with us.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
