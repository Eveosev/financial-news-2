ZTE Corp. (763) ,  China ’s second-biggest
maker of mobile-phone equipment, returned to profit in the first
three months of this year because of an asset sale, after
posting two straight quarterly losses.  Net income  rose 36 percent to 205 million  yuan  ($33
million) from 150.9 million yuan a year earlier, the company
said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange yesterday.
That compared with estimates of 25 million yuan, 52 million yuan
and 200 million yuan, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
three analysts conducted by e-mail.  ZTE reported a loss of 2.84 billion yuan for 2012 that was
triggered by delays in contracts and international projects in
the third and fourth quarters. The company on Jan. 20 projected
it would return to profit in the first quarter of this year
after selling a stake in Shenzhen ZNV Technology Co. that would
produce investment income of more than 820 million yuan in the
first quarter.  Sales in the first quarter fell by 2.8 percent to 18.1
billion yuan, from 18.6 billion.  ZTE fell 0.5 percent to close at HK$12.40 in Hong Kong
trading, before the earnings announcement. The  shares  have
dropped 5.1 percent this year, compared with a 0.5 percent
decline for the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Unlisted Huawei Technologies Co. is China’s largest maker
of mobile-phone equipment.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
