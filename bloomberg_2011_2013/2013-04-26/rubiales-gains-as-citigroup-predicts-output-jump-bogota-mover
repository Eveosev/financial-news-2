Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC) , the
operator of  Colombia ’s largest oil field, rose for a fifth day
as  Citigroup Inc. (C)  forecast the company would report “strong”
first-quarter production gains.  The shares rallied 7.3 percent to 37,560 pesos this week in
Bogota, the second-best performance on Colombia’s benchmark
Colcap index, which rose 0.2 percent. Pacific Rubiales gained
1.5 percent at 12:40 p.m today.  First quarter results “should highlight strong production
growth,” Citigroup analysts Pedro Medeiros and Fernando Valle
wrote in a report today. This could help “enhance investors’
confidence.” Pacific Rubiales is scheduled to report first-
quarter profit on May 8.  Production will average 126,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day in the first quarter, according to Citigroup. For the fourth
quarter, net output averaged 108,149 barrels a day, according to
the company.  The current share price leaves “considerable upside from
exploration and development of its probable reserves,” the
Citigroup analysts wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
