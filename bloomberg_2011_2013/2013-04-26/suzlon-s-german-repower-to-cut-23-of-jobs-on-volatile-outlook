 REpower Systems SE, a German unit
of India’s biggest wind-turbine maker  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , will
cut as many as 750 jobs to reduce costs and prepare the company
for the wind industry’s “volatile” mid-term outlook.  REpower, based in Hamburg, seeks to save about 100 million
euros ($130 million) in the 2013-2014 financial year, it said
today in an e-mailed statement. The manufacturer, with 3,300
employees worldwide, seeks to keep compulsory departures to a
minimum by offering incentives for contract-termination
agreements and letting fixed-term contracts expire, it said.  “We will apply leverage wherever we have recognized need
for action and will be able to realize savings potential for
example in purchasing, production or manufacturing,” REpower
Chief Executive Officer Andreas Nauen said in the statement.  Wind turbine makers led by  General Electric Co (GE) ,  Vestas Wind
Systems A/S (VWS)  and  Siemens AG (SIE)  face narrowing margins after they
reduced prices to compete for orders as European governments cut
clean-energy incentives to curb budget deficits. Cost cuts may
stop the trend. Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co.,
 China ’s biggest maker of  wind turbines , yesterday said its
first-quarter profit increased fivefold as cost reductions
countered a decline in sales.  “Whilst the long-term outlook for the sector remains
strong, the mid-term outlook is expected to remain uncertain and
volatile, and we need to prepare for that,” Nauen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
