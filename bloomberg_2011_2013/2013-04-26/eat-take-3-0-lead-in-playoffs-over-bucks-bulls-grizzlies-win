Ray Allen  scored 23 points and
 LeBron James  added 22 to lead the Miami Heat to a 104-91 win at
the Milwaukee Bucks that gave the defending champions a three-
games-to-none playoff series lead.  In other games last night, the Chicago Bulls beat the
Brooklyn Nets 79-76 for a 2-1 advantage in their best-of-seven
series, and the Memphis Grizzlies won their first game in three
contests with a 94-82 victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.  The New York Knicks seek to extend their lead to 3-0
against the host Boston Celtics tonight. The visiting San
Antonio Spurs are chasing a third straight win against the Los
Angeles Lakers and the Denver Nuggets travel to the  Golden State
Warriors  with their series tied at 1-1.  Allen, who had five 3-pointers last night, set an NBA
postseason career record with 322 shots made beyond the 3-point
line. The old record of 320 was held by Reggie Miller.  The Heat, trailing by two points at halftime, were behind
61-55 midway through the third period before going on a 30-8 run,
which lasted until early in the fourth quarter.  “That’s been our calling card all year, the depth that we
have,” Allen told reporters. “As a team, you’ve got to find a
way to plug in the holes, and every night we find somebody
different.”  The Heat can wrap up the first-round series on April 28 in
Milwaukee.  In Chicago,  Carlos Boozer  had 22 points and 16 rebounds and
Luol Deng had 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Bulls, who
opened a 17-point lead early in the fourth quarter and then
withstood a late Nets rally.  The Nets were led by Brook Lopez with 22 points and seven
blocked shots.  Game 4 in the best-of-seven series is tomorrow at Chicago’s
United Center.  At FedExForum in Memphis,  Zach Randolph  had 27 points and
11 rebounds for the Grizzlies.  Marc Gasol  added 16 points.  Blake Griffin  had 16 points to lead the Clippers.  The Grizzlies host Game 4 tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
