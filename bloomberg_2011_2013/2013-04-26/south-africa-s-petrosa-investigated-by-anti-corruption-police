South Africa ’s anti-corruption
police unit, known as the Hawks, is investigating PetroSA, the
national  oil company .  “The Hawks are investigating PetroSA,” Captain Paul Ramaloko, a spokesman for the elite unit, said today by phone.
He declined to comment further.  Managers at PetroSA ordered irregular payments of 200
million rand ($21.8 million) and risked an additional 800
million rand in potential liabilities, the Johannesburg-based
Mail & Guardian reported, citing interviews, documents and
police affidavits.  The allegations against PetroSA surround the acquisition of
Sabre Oil & Gas Holdings Ltd. for its acreage in  Ghana  and a
plan to buy gas stations in South Africa, according to the
report.  “I am not aware of any investigation by the Hawks at
all,” Kaizer Nyatsumba, PetroSA’s head of corporate affairs,
said in a phone interview. “There has been concerns raised with
the board” regarding procurement matters, he said.  The board has commissioned a review of audits, the company
said in a subsequent statement.  “In the process of increasing PetroSA’s chances of
successfully closing these deals,” some deviations from normal
procurement processes occurred, the company said, referring to
the acquisition of Sabre Oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
