U.K. government bonds rose, with
10-year yields falling the most in three weeks, as a decline in
European and U.S. stocks revived demand for safer assets.  Gilts gained along with Treasuries and German bunds after a
U.S. report showed the world’s biggest economy grew less than
analysts forecast last quarter. U.K. government securities slid
yesterday when data showed Britain’s gross domestic product
expanded in the first three months of the year, enabling the
nation to avoid a recession. The pound strengthened for a third
day against the dollar.  “Gilts are moving in the same direction as German and U.S
bonds as stocks decline,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “The GDP data
yesterday might be a relief but this is still essentially a
story about stagnation and sub-trend growth. Gilt yields are
likely to remain low in this environment.”  The benchmark 10-year gilt  yield  dropped five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.68 percent at 5 p.m. London time,
the biggest drop since April 5. The 1.75 percent bond due in
September 2022 gained 0.45, or 4.50 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,548) face amount, to 100.615.  U.S. GDP grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first
quarter, the Commerce Department said in  Washington , less than
the median estimate of 3 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists.  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index (SPX)  of  shares  fell 0.3 percent and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.4 percent.  Pound Gains  The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.5477, extending this
week’s gain to 1.6 percent. The U.K. currency advanced 0.2
percent to 84.15 pence per euro after appreciating to 83.98
pence, the strongest level since Jan. 24.  Sterling surged versus all of its 16 major counterparts
yesterday when the  Office for National Statistics  said U.K. GDP
expanded 0.3 percent in the first quarter after shrinking 0.3
percent in the prior three months.  The  Bank of England  announces its next decision on May 9
after policy makers were split this month on the need to extend
its 375 billion-pound program of asset purchases known as
quantitative easing.  Short Squeeze  The U.K. “GDP report led to a squeeze of speculative short
positions in the pound,” said  Lee Hardman , a currency
strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London.
“Quantitative easing is off the table for a while. In the near
term the pound could go higher still but that would provide
attractive levels to sell. The economy will struggle to grow
going forward.”  A short squeeze is where traders are forced to buy back a
security whose price is rising after they had earlier sold it
expecting it to decline.  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi predicts the pound will weaken to
$1.45 by year-end, Hardman said.  The pound has advanced 2.3 percent in the past month, the
best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. Sterling has still
weakened 2.6 percent this year.  U.K.  gilts (GUKG10)  returned 1.3 percent in 2013 through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
0.9 percent and Treasuries rose 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
