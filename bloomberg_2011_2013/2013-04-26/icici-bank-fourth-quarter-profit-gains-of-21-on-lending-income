ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) ,  India ’s second-
largest lender by assets, posted a 21 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profit.  Net income  climbed to 23 billion rupees ($424 million), or
19.87 rupees a share, for the three months ended March 31, from
19 billion rupees, or 16.46 rupees, a year earlier, Mumbai-based
ICICI said in an exchange  filing  today. That compared with the
22.9 billion rupee median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Profits are rising on strong loan growth,” Hatim Broachwala, a Mumbai-based analyst at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.,
said ahead of the earnings announcement. “The bank’s renewed
focus on retail is making up for slowing corporate loans and is
driving profit in spite of flat margins.”  Shares of ICICI dropped 3.3 percent to 1,139 rupees as of
2:26 p.m. Mumbai time. The stock has gained 35 percent over the
past year, surpassing the equity benchmark S&P BSE  Sensex (SENSEX) 
index’s 13 percent advance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
