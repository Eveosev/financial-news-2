Sinovel Wind Energy Group Co. (601558) ,
China’s third-biggest maker of wind turbines, forecast a first-
half net loss and reported a bigger-than-expected 2012 loss as
wind-power investment slowed and industry competition increased.  Net loss was 583 million  yuan  in 2012, exceeding the
company’s 490 million yuan loss forecast made in January and a
profit of 598.8 million yuan in 2011, Sinovel said yesterday in
a filing to the Shanghai stock exchange. Sales tumbled 58
percent to 4.02 billion yuan. First-quarter 2013 net loss was
248.5 million yuan against year-earlier net income of 28.6
million yuan, according to a separate filing.  “Drop in growth in emerging markets and developing
countries and global economic slowdown affected investment in
the wind power industry,” the Beijing-based company said in the
full-year earnings statement.  Turbine makers have seen a drop in profits and some have
posted losses amid slower industry growth. Installations of  wind
turbines  in China fell 18 percent to 15.9 gigawatts last year
from 2011, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.  To counter a slump in sales, Urumqi-based Xinjiang Goldwind
Science & Technology Co. and Denmark’s  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) 
have said they are cutting costs.  Sinovel fell 1.6 percent to close at 5.01 yuan in Shanghai
trading yesterday, before earnings were released.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
