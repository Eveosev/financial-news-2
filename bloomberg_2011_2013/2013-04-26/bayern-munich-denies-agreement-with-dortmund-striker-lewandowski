Bayern Munich  denied a German
newspaper report that it’s reached an agreement to sign Borussia
Dortmund striker  Robert Lewandowski .  Bild reported  today on its website that Lewandowski, who’s
scored 34 goals this season, signed a pre-contract to join the
Bundesliga champion either after this season, if the teams can
agree on a fee, or in 2014 when he becomes a free agent.  “Contrary to these media reports, FC Bayern doesn’t have a
contract with Robert Lewandowski,” the club said in a statement
on its website.  Lewandowski scored all four goals two nights ago as
Dortmund beat Real Madrid 4-1 in the opening game of their
Champions League semifinal. The 24-year-old Poland international
is the competition’s second-leading scorer with 10 goals.  Bayern earlier this week agreed to activate the release
clause, reported by Bild to be worth 37 million euros ($48
million), in the contract of Dortmund’s 20-year-old playmaker
Mario Goetze.  Dortmund’s win over Real Madrid came a day after Bayern
routed Barcelona 4-0 to open that semifinal. The Spanish clubs
will host the return matches next week, with the winners
advancing to the May 25 final at Wembley Stadium in  London .
German teams have never met in the title match of Europe’s elite
club competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
