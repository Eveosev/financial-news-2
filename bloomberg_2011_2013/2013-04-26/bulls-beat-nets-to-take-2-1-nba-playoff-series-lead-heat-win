Carlos Boozer  had 22 points and 16
rebounds as the  Chicago Bulls  won 79-76 against the Brooklyn
Nets to take a two-games-to-one lead in their National
Basketball Association first-round playoff series.  The host Bulls opened a 17-point lead early in the fourth
quarter and then withstood a late Nets rally. Game 4 in the
best-of-seven series is April 27 at Chicagoâ€™s United Center.  In Milwaukee,  LeBron James  scored 22 points and
the Miami Heat used a 30-8 second-half run to take control in a
104-91 win against the Bucks that gave the defending champions a
three-games-to-none playoff series lead.  Miami can complete a first-round sweep on April 28
in Milwaukee.  Ray Allen had 23 points for Miami, including five 3-
pointers -- setting an NBA postseason record with 322 shots made  beyond the 3-point line. The old record of 320 was held by
Reggie Miller.  The Heat trailed by two points at halftime and were behind
61-55 midway through the third period before going on their
decisive run, which lasted until early in the fourth quarter.  Also tonight, the  Los Angeles Clippers  are seeking
a 3-0 lead in their series against the host Memphis Grizzlies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
