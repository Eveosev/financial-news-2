TiVo Inc. (TIVO) , the company that
popularized digital video recorders, rose 2.1 percent after a
judge set a trial date in a case against Motorola Mobility.  TiVo, based in Alviso, California, advanced to $11.55 at
the close of trading in New York. The shares have declined 6.2
percent this year.  U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap denied a motion by TiVo
to reschedule the patent trial, now set for June 10, according
to a posted ruling. The shares rose as investors welcomed the
earlier trial date and possible resolution,  Alan Gould , an
analyst with Evercore Partners, said in an e-mail.  TiVo had sought a delay until August. Its lead trial
lawyer, Morgan Chu, is scheduled for an unrelated trial in
Nevada in June, and its expert witness on damages is scheduled
for a June trial in a drug case in  New Jersey , TiVo said in an
April 17 filing with the court. Motorola Mobility, in an April
24 filing, said it was ready to begin and had conflicts during
the time requested by TiVo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
