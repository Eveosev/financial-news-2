Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA , the second-largest Brazilian steelmaker by output, fell the
most among global peers after reporting a quarterly loss that
exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Preferred shares of Usiminas, as the  Belo Horizonte ,
Brazil-based company is known, declined 5 percent to 10.09 reais
at 3:16 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , heading toward its lowest close since
March 25. The drop was the biggest  among  global peers tracked by
Bloomberg.  Usiminas said today first-quarter net loss more than
doubled to 153.6 million reais ($76.9 million), missing the 49.3
million average loss of four  analysts’ estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Lower than expected steel and iron-ore shipments and
higher costs explain the earnings miss, BES Securities analysts
led by Catarina Pedrosa said in a note to clients.  “Results were slightly worse than expected,” the Sao
Paulo-based analysts said today. “Most of the improvement we
expect is already priced in.”  Usiminas will continue seeking to cut its debt levels and
increase productivity, Chief Executive Officer Julian Eguren
said on a quarterly earnings conference call today. The
steelmaker, which increased prices to distributors in  Brazil 
twice in the first quarter, had “some volume losses” to
competitors, Vice President Sergio Leite said during the call.  Gerdau SA is Brazil’s largest steelmaker by output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
