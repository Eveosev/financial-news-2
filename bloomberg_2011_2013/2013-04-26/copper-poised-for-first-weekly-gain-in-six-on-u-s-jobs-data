Copper climbed for a third day in
 London , set for the first weekly advance in six, after data
showed the U.S. economy is improving.  Metal for delivery in three months rose as much as 1.1
percent to $7,258 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,250 by 9:30 a.m. Shanghai time. It has
added 3.7 percent this week, after slumping 5.6 percent in the
five days through April 19. The August contract on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange gained 2.1 percent to 52,370  yuan  ($8,324) a
ton, as the July futures on the Comex in New York rose 1.2
percent to $3.2825 a pound.  Applications for U.S. unemployment benefits fell to a six-
week low, and Bloomberg’s Consumer Comfort Index held close to
the highest level in five years, yesterday’s data showed. First-
quarter gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 3
percent, up from 0.4 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31,
according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before
today’s Commerce Department report.  “Recent U.S. data have shown strength, and it helped the
rebound as some deem the retreat is overdone,” Lu Minsu, an
analyst at New Century Futures Co.  On the LME, nickel and aluminum climbed while lead fell and
zinc was little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
