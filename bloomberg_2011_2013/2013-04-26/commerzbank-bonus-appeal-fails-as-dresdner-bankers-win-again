Commerzbank AG (CBK)  must pay 50 million
euros ($65 million) to 104 bankers at its now-defunct Dresdner
unit after a U.K. appeals court refused to overturn a judge’s
decision that the German lender must honor its promises on
bonuses.  There was overwhelming evidence justifying the conclusion
that the bonus promises made to the bankers were intended to be
legally binding, Justice Patrick Elias said in a ruling in
 London  today.  Commerzbank, which reduced bonuses by 90 percent after
taking over Dresdner in 2009, argued a 6.5 billion-euro loss at
the unit justified the move, even though Dresdner executives
promised employees the previous year money would be set aside
for compensation.  While banks try to combat or avoid European Union proposals
for some of the world’s toughest pay curbs, Commerzbank has
fought legal battles in  Germany , Italy and Japan to defend its
bonus cuts. At the 2012 trial in London, Chief Executive Officer
 Martin Blessing  said he wanted bankers to be motivated by
loyalty not money.  The ruling “is a triumph for common sense and for some
very well-established principles of English contract law,”
Clive Zietman, the lawyer for 83 of the bankers, said in a
written statement. “It is a great pity that the bank saw fit to
contest so vigorously and for so long, a case that could so
easily have been avoided.”  Commerzbank bought Dresdner from  Allianz SE (ALV)  in January
2009, the same year it took an 18.2 billion-euro bailout from
Germany at the height of the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
