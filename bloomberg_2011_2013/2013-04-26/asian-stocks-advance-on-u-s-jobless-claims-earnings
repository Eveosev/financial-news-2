Most Asian  stocks  fell as corporate
earnings showed mixed results and the  Bank of Japan  added
nothing new to its stimulus pledge. The regional benchmark index
remains headed toward its biggest monthly advance since at least
December.  Shiseido Co., Asia’s biggest cosmetics maker, slumped 8.3
percent in Tokyo after reducing its dividend. Advantest dropped
7.9 percent after the maker of chip testers posted an unexpected
loss on falling computer demand. BYD Co., the Chinese automaker
partially owned by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,

will surge.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.1 percent to 139.79 at

2.6 percent advance this week, while having gained 3.1 percent
this month.  “Profit results look OK,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based
head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
has $126 billion under management. “Investors are giving  Japan 
the benefit of the doubt. If it’s a good profit or economic
figure, investors say it’s good. And if it’s a bad one, they say
it doesn’t matter because the BOJ is doing stimulus.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 8.2 percent this year
through yesterday amid optimism Japan will deploy more measures
to beat deflation and that policy makers in the U.S. and China
remain on standby to support growth. Just two of 10 industries

yesterday, compared with 14.4 times for the S&P 500 and 12.9
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japan Stimulus  The BOJ today reiterated its commitment to double the
country’s monetary base in two years, adding as much as 70
trillion yen ($710 billion) a year to the amount of money
circulating in the economy. Consumer prices, excluding the
impact of a sales-tax increase and volatile fresh food costs,
will rise 1.9 percent in the fiscal year starting in April 2015,
according to the median estimate of BOJ board members published
today.  Japan’s Topix Index fell 1 percent as the yen extended
gains following the BOJ’s announcement. South Korea’s  Kospi
Index (KOSPI)  dropped 0.4 percent.  Australia ’s  S&P/ASX 200 (AS51)  Index fell
0.1 percent today, while capping a 3.4 percent gain  this week ,

exchanges, slipped 1 percent.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index (TWSE)  was little
changed. Singapore’s Straits Times Index climbed 0.2 percent.  Earnings Results  Of the 159 companies on the Asia-Pacific gauge that have

pledging cost cuts to recover from the first full-year loss in
eight years.  Advantest tumbled 7.9 percent to 1,412 yen, its steepest
slide since July, after posting a net loss of 3.8 billion yen
versus the 333 million yen profit estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that rose, BYD surged 12 percent to HK$28.15
after saying first-half net income may soar to as much as 500
