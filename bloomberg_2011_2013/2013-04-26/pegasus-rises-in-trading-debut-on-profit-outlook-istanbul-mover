Pegasus Hava Tasimaciligi AS (PGSUS)  rose
in its first day of trading in Istanbul on speculation expansion
by the low-cost Turkish carrier will boost profit this year.  Pegasus, whose passenger count advanced 20 percent in 2012
to 13.6 million,  climbed  1.9 percent to 18.75 liras at the close
in Istanbul. The airline sold a 34.5 percent stake for 649.4
million liras ($360.7 million), valuing it at 1.88 billion
liras, according to the initial public offering prospectus.  Pegasus, which offers flights to 24 destinations in  Turkey 
and 39 cities abroad, posted a net income of 126.3 million liras
in 2012 after a 14.1 million-lira loss the year earlier,
according to the prospectus. Domestic demand for the IPO was 2.2
times the amount offered, while demand from foreign investors,
who bought 70 percent of the 35.3 million shares, was 1.8 times,
according to  Is Yatirim Menkul Degerler AS (ISMEN) , lead manager of the
sale.  “Investors who couldn’t get the shares during book-
building are possibly buying today, while those who got them
aren’t selling, convinced that the price will go further
north,” Burak Isyar, an analyst at Burgan Securities in
Istanbul, said in a phone interview. The brokerage was among 31
handling the IPO.  Pegasus will use the IPO proceeds to expand its network and
finance airplane purchases, while some of the cash will “bring
flexibility” to the balance sheet, the Anatolia news agency
reported today, citing Chairman Ali Sabanci. The Istanbul-based
company purchased 75 planes from Airbus in December with an
option to buy 25 more as it seeks to expand its fleet.  Pegasus is the country’s second carrier to sell shares to
the public after  Turkish Airlines , the biggest, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
