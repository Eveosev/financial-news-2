India’s one-year  interest-rate
swaps  headed for a fifth weekly decline on speculation cooling
inflation will give the central bank room to cut interest rates.  Eighteen of 22 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey predict
the  Reserve Bank  of India will reduce its  repurchase  rate by 25
basis points to 7.25 percent at a review on May 3, while three
forecast no change. One expects a 50 basis point cut.  Wholesale (INFINFY) 
prices rose 5.96 percent in March from a year earlier, the
slowest pace since November 2009, official data show.  “Softening inflation will give the central bank comfort to
cut rates,” said Shubhada Rao, Mumbai-based chief economist at
 Yes Bank Ltd. (YES)  “Moderation in gold and oil prices will further
ease inflation and diminish concerns about the current-account
deficit. That will give the RBI room to follow up with another
rate cut after May 3.”  The one-year swap, a derivative contract used to guard
against fluctuations in funding costs, fell four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, this week to 7.23 percent as of 9:32
a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.
It fell one basis point today. The fixed cost to lock in
 interest rates  for a year touched 7.21 percent on April 23, the
lowest level since January 2011.  Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao cut the repo  rate  by
50 basis points in the first quarter to help revive Asia’s
third-largest economy. The nation’s gross domestic  product  rose
5 percent in the fiscal year ended March 31, the weakest pace
since 2003, the statistics agency estimates.  Oil, Gold  Brent crude oil has declined 6.4 percent this month, while
gold lost almost 8 percent. India is the world’s top bullion
buyer and fourth-largest oil consumer, with imports contributing
to a record $32.6 billion current-account deficit in the last
quarter of 2012.  Easing inflation “increases the probability of a more
accommodative monetary policy,”  Raghuram Rajan , the top adviser
in the  Finance Ministry , said in an April 16 interview.  Government bonds gained this week. The yield on the
benchmark 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two basis points
this week and one basis point today to 7.76 percent, according
to the central bank’s trading system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
