Six bottles of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 sold for 16,100 euros ($20,920) at a Christie’s International Plc wine auction in Amsterdam this week and a case of Chateaux Margaux from the same year sold for 7,475 euros.  Other wines featuring in the top five lots included a single bottle of Romanee-Conti 1986 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy, which fetched 6,900 euros, 12 bottles of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1986 which sold for 6,670 euros and three bottles of Chateau Cheval Blanc 1949, which fetched 6,325 euros.  Demand from investors has revived after a 17-month price slide which started in July 2011, boosting the London-based Liv-ex  Fine Wine 50 Index (LXFW50)  by 10 percent since November. The index fell in the first three weeks of April after posting its fourth straight monthly gain in March.  With investors’ attention focused on the pricing of the new Bordeaux 2012 vintage this month, trading elsewhere on the wine market “has been pretty static,” said William Grey, a manager at the Wine Investment Fund in London. “There’s been a bit of resurgence of interest in 1996” wines and “a little bit of interest in the 2000s,” he said.  The fund, which has about $50 million under management, is focused on top Bordeaux producers and vintages and doesn’t buy in the futures market.  Other leading lots in the Christie’s auction included 12 bottles of Cheval Blanc 1982, which fetched 6,210 euros, separate cases of Lafite 1993 and 1994, which attracted winning bids of 5,750 euros each, and six bottles of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1982, which also sold for 5,750 euros.
