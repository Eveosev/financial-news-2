Most  U.S. stocks  fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index paring a weekly gain, after data showed the world’s largest economy grew less than economists forecast amid disappointing earnings reports.  Equities trimmed steeper losses in the final hours of trading as technology shares  rebounded . Hewlett-Packard Co. and Apple Inc. gained more than 1.9 percent.  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  slid 7.2 percent after saying it may post an operating loss in the second quarter.  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  dropped 0.8 percent as it reported sales that trailed analysts’ estimates. J.C. Penney Co. jumped 12 percent as billionaire investor  George Soros  disclosed a stake in the retailer.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  fell 0.2 percent to 1,582.24 at 4 p.m. in New York, after dropping as much as 0.5 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to 14,712.55. About two stocks fell for every one gaining on U.S. exchanges as 5.7 billion shares traded hands, 11 percent below the three-month average.  “The GDP number does show that the U.S. economy is still in a slow-growth mode, albeit slightly below expectations,” Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in  Minneapolis , said by telephone. His firm manages $110 billion. “I still like the risk reward for equities but it’s a ride the highs, buy the dips market.”  Gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, lower than forecast, after a 0.4 percent fourth-quarter advance, Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median estimate of 86 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 3 percent gain. Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, climbed by the most since the fourth quarter of 2010.  Consumer Confidence  A separate report showed  confidence among consumers  fell in April to a three-month low as Americans grew more pessimistic about the outlook for the economy.

The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent yesterday, extending its gains since April 18 to 2.8 percent, as companies reported earnings that beat estimates. The benchmark equity gauge has surged 134 percent from a 12-year low in 2009 as  corporate earnings  topped forecasts and the Federal Reserve embarked on three rounds of bond purchases to spur economic growth. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent this week, heading for a monthly gain of 0.8 percent.  ‘More Cautious’  “Investors are tiptoeing into the waters and trying to figure out whether it’s too hot or too cold,”  Frederic Dickson , who helps manage $32 billion as chief investment strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego,  Oregon , said by phone. “The GDP number was disappointing, and we approach recent record highs, investors are a little more cautious, but we’re still winding up a fairly good week in equities.”  Fed policy makers have said they will maintain stimulus until the labor market improves “significantly.” The economy’s inability to sustain faster growth means central bankers will probably affirm a pledge to keep buying bonds when they meet next week. The Labor Department releases its monthly jobs report on May 3.  Global stocks rallied this week as speculation mounted the European Central Bank will cut rates on May 2. The majority of 61 economists in a Bloomberg News survey have predicted that the central bank will lower its benchmark rate to 0.5 percent from 0.75 percent.

Expedia Inc. declined 9.9 percent to $58.56 as Chief Financial Officer Mark Okerstrom lowered his 2013 forecast for so-called organic earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by $20 million to $30 million, citing increased competition facing its Hotwire discount-travel website.
