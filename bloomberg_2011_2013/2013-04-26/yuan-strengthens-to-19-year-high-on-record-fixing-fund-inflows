China ’s  yuan  advanced to a 19-year
high after the central bank set a record reference rate for the
currency amid signs capital inflows are gathering pace.  China’s financial and capital account surplus was $101.8
billion in the first quarter, the most since 2010 and almost
double the $56.1 billion reported for the same period of 2012,
official data showed yesterday. The currency was at a 0.91
percent premium to the People’s Bank of China’s  reference rate ,
which was raised by 0.15 percent to 6.2208. The spot rate is
allowed to diverge from the fixing by a maximum 1 percent.  “Pressure for yuan appreciation is growing as China’s
surplus jumped,” said  Daniel Chan , a Hong Kong-based executive
vice president at Glory Sky Global Markets Ltd. “Funds inflow
has been strong and that’s boosting the exchange rate.”  The yuan rose 0.2 percent this week to close at 6.1650 per
dollar in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It gained 0.09 percent today and touched 6.1616,
the strongest level since the government unified the official
and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The yuan appreciated 0.74 percent in April, the best month
since October 2012. China will start a three-day Labour Day
holiday on April 29 and trading will resume on May 2.  The U.S. Treasury is expected to label China a currency
manipulator in its next semi-annual report,  Tim Condon ,
Singapore-based head of Asia research at ING Groep NV wrote in a
report today. French President  Francois Hollande  called on China
to improve market access to narrow its trade surplus with France
after a meeting in Beijing with Chinese President Xi Jinping
yesterday.  Offshore Markets  Hong Kong Monetary Authority will relax yuan capital rules
for local banks by scrapping a limit on net open positions and a
minimum requirement for the lenders’ liquid assets in the
Chinese currency, Chief Executive  Norman Chan  told reporters
yesterday in the city. The move is positive for offshore yuan
and forwards, HSBC Holdings Plc strategists  Paul Mackel  and  Ju Wang  wrote in a note yesterday.  The city had over 38,000 yuan accounts opened by non-
residents at the end of February, bringing total yuan savings by
non-residents to over 7 billion yuan, HKMA said in a briefing
document to legislative council today.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan climbed 0.01
percent today to 6.1665 per dollar, contributing to a 0.21
percent advance this week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched a record 6.1617. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards rose 0.06 percent to 6.2372, trading at a
1.2 percent discount to the spot rate in Shanghai. The contracts
gained 0.14 percent this week.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this week to 1.45
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
