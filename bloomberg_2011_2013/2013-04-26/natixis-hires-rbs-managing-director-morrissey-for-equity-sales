Natixis (KN) , the investment-banking
unit of Franceâ€™s second-largest bank by branches, hired Brian Morrissey as head of equity flow sales.  Morrissey, who joined Natixis on April 22, is based in New
York and reports to Stephane Launay, head of equity markets
Americas and John Kolb, head of equity finance Americas, said
Mitch Karig, a spokesman for Natixis in New York.  Morrissey was most recently a managing director and head of
Delta One sales at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
He reported to Robert Hammer and traded instruments such as
total return swaps to financial institutions. He joined ABN AMRO
Bank NV in July 2008, which was later bought by RBS.  Ed Canaday , a spokesman for RBS, declined to comment on the
move. Morrissey declined to comment when reached by telephone at
his office.  Delta One traders typically help clients speculate on or
hedge the performance of a group of securities. Total-return
swaps are derivative contracts used to exchange the economic
benefit and risk of loans for steady periodic payments.  Groupe BPCE is the parent of Natixis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
