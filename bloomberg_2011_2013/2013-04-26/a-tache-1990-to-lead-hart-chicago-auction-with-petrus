A case of La Tache 1990 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti from Burgundy is among leading lots at a Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. auction in  Chicago  next month, along with a 12-bottle DRC 1978 Assortment and a case of Chateau Petrus 1990.  The La Tache carries an upper estimate of $55,000 while the DRC Assortment is priced at as much as $45,000 and the Petrus may go under the hammer for as much as $38,000, according to an e-mail from the auction house.  Demand from investors for Bordeaux after two price slumps in the past five years has boosted the London-based Liv-ex  Fine Wine 50 Index (LXFW50)  by 10 percent since November, when it touched a 31-month low. The gauge fell in the first three weeks of April after posting four straight monthly gains, as investors focused on the pricing of the new Bordeaux 2012 vintage coming to market and how that will effect older wines already trading.  “The first growths were very reasonable on the 2012s,” said William Grey, a manager at the Wine Investment Fund in London. “When prices are released, people look at back vintages.”  The fund, which has about $50 million under management, is focused on top Bordeaux producers and vintages and doesn’t buy in the futures market.  The Hart sale includes 126 lots of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, 104 lots of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, 75 lots of  Chateau Margaux  and 63 lots of Chateau Haut Brion.  Domaine Ponsot  Other top lots in the Hart sale include 12 bottles of Clos de la Roche Vieilles Vignes Domaine Ponsot 1985 Burgundy, which carries a top estimate of $38,000, a case of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 Pauillac with a $35,000 price tag and two cases of Richebourg DRC 1990 Burgundy being sold separately, one from the 1990 vintage and one from 1966.  Acker Merrall & Condit is holding a sale in  New York  today, where leading Burgundies include a three-bottle lot of Romanee-Conti 1999 DRC estimated at as much as $45,000 and six magnums of La Tache 2001 priced to fetch as much as $35,000, part of a group of lots featuring magnums from the region, according to Acker’s online auction catalog.  Top Bordeaux lots in the Acker sale include six bottles of Petrus 2005 priced to fetch as much as $20,000, a case of Chateau Haut Brion 1982 with an upper estimate of $9,000 and 12 bottles of Chateau Latour 1990 with a top estimate of $8,500.
