Hospitals will get a pay raise from
the U.S. government for treating patients in the nation’s
Medicare program.  The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans
to raise payments 0.8 percent beginning Oct. 1 for services that
elderly and disabled patients receive after being admitted to
hospitals, according to a regulatory  proposal  today. Long-term
care hospitals that treat patients after they’re discharged from
acute-care centers would see a 1.1 percent increase.  The proposed payment changes would raise  government
spending  for hospital care by about $53 million next year,
including programs that aim to discourage hospitals from
readmitting patients soon after they are discharged and to
punish hospitals that too frequently spread infections to
patients. A final rule on the fiscal 2014 payments is scheduled
to be issued by Aug. 1.  “Dedicated professionals are working day and night in
hospitals to provide the care that Medicare beneficiaries
need,”  Marilyn Tavenner , the acting administrator of the agency
that runs Medicare, said in a statement. “The new policies in
this proposed rule support hospitals’ important work and the
people with Medicare who depend on them by promoting safety and
care improvement.”  Acute-care facilities are the most-numerous type of
hospital in the country and include facilities owned by  HCA
Holdings Inc. (HCA) , the largest publicly traded chain, as well as
nonprofits such as  Cleveland Clinic . Medicare, the U.S.
government’s health-care program for the elderly and disabled,
pays more than $100 billion a year to hospitals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
