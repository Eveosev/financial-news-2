A Turkish court canceled the
conviction of  Fazil Say , the classical pianist and composer, on
charges of inciting hatred and insulting Islam, ordering a
retrial, state-run Anatolia news agency says today.
* The court ruled that Say, who was given a suspended sentence
of 10 months in prison on April 15 by a lower court, was not
fully informed of his rights regarding the verdict and there
were procedural errors, Anatolia says
* Today’s decision was taken in response to an appeal by Say’s
lawyer Meltem Akyol, Anatolia says
* NOTE: Say was convicted on April 15 of insulting holy values
“such as hell and paradise” of Islam, Christianity and
Judaism; story: NSN MLAOEK1A74E9 <GO>
* NOTE: The case against Say, who has played with the  New York
Philharmonic  and Berlin Symphony orchestras, was based on about
half a dozen postings on Twitter  To contact the reporter on this story:
