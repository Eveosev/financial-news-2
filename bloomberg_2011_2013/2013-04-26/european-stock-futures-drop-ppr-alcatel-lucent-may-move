European stocks fell, paring their
biggest weekly rally in five months, as companies from  PPR (PP)  SA to
Total SA posted financial results that disappointed investors,
while the U.S. economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace.  PPR slid the most since May 2009 after reporting first-
quarter sales that missed analysts’ estimates as Gucci posted
its weakest quarterly growth in more than three years. Total
lost 1.4 percent after  Europe ’s third-largest oil producer said
earnings fell. BASF SE rose 3.7 percent as the world’s biggest
chemical maker posted profit that beat analysts’ projections.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.3 percent to 295.89 at
the close of trading in  London , paring an earlier retreat of as
much as 0.9 percent. The gauge has still gained 3.7 percent this
week, its biggest rally since November 2012, as investors
speculated that the  European Central Bank  will cut  interest
rates . The equity benchmark has  risen 5.8 percent  this year.  “We’ve seen markets well up this week, so a breather after
such a massive rally is to be expected,” Mark Andersen, who
helps oversee $1.7 trillion as co-head of  asset allocation  at
UBS AG in Zurich, said in a telephone interview. “On the one
hand, the market got excited about a possible rate cut by the
ECB. On the other hand, quarterly results have reminded us that
the European economy is not in a great spot.”  National benchmark indexes retreated in 15 of the 17
western-European markets that opened today. France’s CAC 40
dropped 0.8 percent and  Germany ’s DAX slipped 0.2 percent. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 declined 0.3 percent. Denmark’s equity market
was closed for a national holiday.  U.S. Economy  A Commerce Department report in  Washington  showed that the
 U.S. economy  grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than
estimated. Gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent
annualized rate, compared with the 3 percent economists had
forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The world’s largest economy
expanded 0.4 percent in the final three months of 2012.  The ECB holds its next interest-rate setting meeting on May
2.  Forty three of 69 economists  in a Bloomberg News survey have
predicted that the central bank will lower its benchmark rate to
0.5 percent from 0.75 percent.  PPR slumped 6.7 percent to 166.50 euros after posting
 first-quarter sales  from continuing operations that climbed 1
percent to 2.37 billion euros ($3.1 billion). That missed the
2.41 billion-euro  average analyst estimate  in a Bloomberg
survey. PPR said revenue at its sports and lifestyle businesses
dropped, especially in western Europe.  Total, Ziggo  Total declined 1.4 percent to 37.55 euros as the  oil
company  said earnings slid 7 percent because of losses from a
canceled Canadian oil-sands project and lower output.  Profit (FP) 
excluding changes in inventories fell to 2.9 billion euros in
the first quarter, in line with the 2.92 billion-euro average
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Total made a 3.1
billion-euro profit a year earlier.  Ziggo NV (ZIGGO)  slid 4.1 percent to 26.70 euros. Warburg Pincus
LLC and Cinven Ltd. sold their remaining 17 percent in the Dutch
cable company, according to a statement. The two shareholders
sold the securities for 25.75 euros apiece, which was a 7.5
percent discount to yesterday’s closing price.  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  fell 2.8 percent to 71.90 euros,
contributing the most to the Stoxx 600’s slide. The brewer said
it will shortly start its tender offer for the Grupo Modelo SAB
shares that it does not already own. Separately, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. added the stock to its conviction sell list.  Commodity Producers  A gauge of European mining companies posted the worst
performance on the Stoxx 600. Xstrata Plc and  Glencore (GLEN) 
International Plc dropped 2.5 percent to 979.9 pence and 3.5
percent to 319.35 pence, respectively. Glencore will become the
world’s fourth-biggest mining company when it completes the
acquisition of Xstrata next month.  YIT Oyj (YTY1V)  plunged 8 percent to 15.03 euros, its biggest slump
since October 2011. Finland’s biggest residential developer
posted first-quarter net income of 25.1 million euros, missing
the 39.2 million-euro  average analyst projection .  BASF climbed 3.7 percent to 72.59 euros after first-quarter
earnings before interest, taxes and one-off items increased 10
percent to 2.21 billion euros. That compared with the average
analyst estimate that had called for 2.09 billion euros.  Vinci SA (DG)  added 3.4 percent to 36.71 euros, its largest
advance in seven months, as Goldman Sachs said the company’s
first-quarter results beat expectations and supported upgrades.
Europe’s biggest builder said  sales  rose 3.4 percent to 8.4
billion euros.  DNB Jumps  DNB ASA (DNB)  advanced 5.2 percent to 92.50 kroner after Norway’s
biggest bank said first-quarter  net income  amounted to 3.18
billion kroner ($543 million), exceeding the 2.76 billion kroner
that analysts had estimated.  National Bank of Greece SA surged 8.2 percent to 76.9 euro
cents. The lender plans to raise 12 percent of its
recapitalization needs from private investors, up from a
previous target of 10 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 28 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
