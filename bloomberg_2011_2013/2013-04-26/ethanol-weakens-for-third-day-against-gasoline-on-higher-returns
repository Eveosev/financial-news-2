Ethanol weakened for a third day
against gasoline, the longest streak of losses in a month, as
higher returns for processing corn into the biofuel spurred
companies to lift output.  The spread widened 1.71 cents to 37.59 cents a gallon as
companies including Poet LLC,  Abengoa SA (ABG)  and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
resumed production at idled mills. An April 24 Energy
Information Administration report showed  production  rose to
853,000 barrels a day in the week ended April 19, 1,000 barrels
shy of this year’s high. Renewable Identification Numbers for
corn-based ethanol jumped the most in more than two weeks.  “It’s been picking up with the margin improving,” said
Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in
Galena,  Illinois . “You almost expect that to continue.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 0.6 cent to $2.459
a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Prices have gained 12
percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery advanced 2.31 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.8349 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Manufacturing costs have eased as corn prices have tumbled
on rising inventory estimates and projections that U.S. farmers
would boost planting to the most since 1936.  Corn for May delivery decreased 1.25 cents to $6.44 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread was 12 cents a gallon, up from 11
cents yesterday. That compares to minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Poet, the second-biggest U.S. ethanol producer, said April
23 that it restarted operations at its Macon, Missouri, mill,
two months after shutting the plant down because of a shortage
of corn.  Stockpiles rose 0.5 percent to 17.6 million barrels last
week, data form the Energy Department’s analytical arm show,
down 19 percent from a year earlier.  Corn-based RINs jumped 9.6 percent to 68.5 cents, the
highest price in a week and the biggest one-day gain since April
8, data compiled by Bloomberg show. , which cover biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, were unchanged at 77 cents.  RINs are certificates assigned to each gallon of biofuel to
track compliance with government mandates. Once the fuel is
mixed with petroleum, refiners can keep the certificate or trade
it.  Ethanol Imports  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 93 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, the lowest since March 29 and down
1.1 percent from the previous week, the most recent EIA report
showed.  Imports of the biofuel averaged 39,000 barrels a day last
week, the first time the U.S. has made foreign purchases since
March 29, according to EIA.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  fetched $2.64 a gallon last
week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.48 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf at $2.545, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol in  New York  Harbor gained 7.5
cents to $2.695 a gallon and on the West Coast it climbed 2.5
cents to $2.70.  West Coast ethanol premium over  Gulf Coast  expanded 2.5
cents to 15.5 cents and Chicago’s discount to New York stretched
7.5 cents to 21.5 cents, the widest since Dec. 9, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
