I love Lean. In my eyes, the work Steve Blank, Eric Ries, and others have done to provide a cogent, accessible frame around the academic concepts of emergent strategy is one of the most important contributions to the innovation movement over the past few years.  I have  repeatedly stated   that the next wave of innovation will come from companies that harness the transformational power that too often lies latent inside their organizations. There is a growing sense that so-called lean start-up techniques —  developing a minimal viable product, learning in the marketplace, and pivoting based on market feedback — can help to unleash this potential. Indeed, in this month's  Harvard Business Review   cover story , Blank notes that the development of the lean start-up toolkit comes "just in time" to "help existing companies deal with the forces of continual disruption."  If I had a quibble with lean techniques it is with the extreme perspective that some practitioners take that research and thinking are useless — that learning comes only  from developing prototypes and testing in-market. That's not right. Any initial strategy for a new growth business will be partially wrong, but the thinking that went into it is likely to be partially right, too. Good innovators invest the time to research their opportunities and formulate as robust hypotheses as they can so that they focus the learning from their experiments.  Consider the research Jeff Bezos did before he founded Amazon.com that led him to focus on books rather than music, clothing, or electronic appliances. Studying the book market then led Bezos to locate his company near some of the major book distributors. Sure, he might have gotten there through experimentation, but studying market dynamics helped him to cut a couple of corners. There's no doubt that people inside large companies  over-engineer  business plans, but don't let the pendulum swing too far the other way. Of course, the value of a tool depends on its application. Innosight's  field experience  helping large companies more systematically pursue the creation of disruptive growth businesses suggests that leaders looking to leverage lean should heed three pieces of advice.
