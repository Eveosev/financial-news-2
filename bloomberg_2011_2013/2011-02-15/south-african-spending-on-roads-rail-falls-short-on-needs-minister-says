  South Africa  will spend 22.3 billion
rand on road maintenance over the next three fiscal years, still
short of the 75 billion rand it needs to address an investment
backlog, Transport Minister Sibusiso Ndebele said in a statement
distributed in  Cape Town  today.  The country’s commuter rail services have an investment
backlog of 93 billion rand, he said. France, Germany, China, the
U.S., Canada and South Korea are ready to finance South Africa’s
rail expansion, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
