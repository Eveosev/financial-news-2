U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary
Clinton  has appointed retired diplomat Marc Grossman to replace
Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan
who died in December, according to state department officials.  Clinton is expected to announce the appointment later this
week, according to three officials who spoke yesterday on
condition of anonymity because they werenâ€™t authorized to
comment on the matter.  Grossman retired from the State Department in 2005 after
serving as ambassador to Turkey, assistant secretary for
European affairs and under secretary of State for political
affairs. He is currently a vice president at the  Cohen Group , a
consulting firm founded by former Defense Secretary  William Cohen  that helps companies do business overseas.  Grossman will be moving into the position at a time when
the U.S. and  Pakistan  are in a standoff over the detention of an
American who killed two Pakistanis. The U.S. is insisting he is
a diplomat and therefore deserves immunity.  In Afghanistan, U.S. troops are preparing to start a
gradual withdrawal later this year. State Department staff will
help manage the transition in which Afghan forces are supposed
to assume a greater role in security operations in their country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
