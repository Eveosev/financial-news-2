Finland’s former Prime Minister
Matti Vanhanen may escape being charged and tried in the High
Court of Impeachment, state-owned broadcaster YLE reported
today, citing unidentified sources.
  Finland’s parliament’s constitutional committee may decide not
to prosecute Vanhanen for failing to excuse himself from a
meeting where the government decided to distribute funds to an
organization that had supported Vanhanen’s 2006 presidential
bid, YLE said. 
  The committee is set to decide on the case tomorrow, YLE said
separately.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
