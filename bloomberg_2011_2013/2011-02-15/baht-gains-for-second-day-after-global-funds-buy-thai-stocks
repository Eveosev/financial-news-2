Thailand’s baht rose for a second
day after overseas investors boosted holdings of the nation’s
stocks.  Government bonds  were steady.  Exchange data show global funds bought $65 million more
Thai equities than they sold yesterday, contributing to a 1.8
percent gain in the benchmark  stock index . The currency also
gained on speculation the central bank will tolerate
appreciation to stem inflation. Consumer prices rose 3.03
percent in January from a year earlier, the most in five months,
a government report showed this month.  “There was a rebound in stocks yesterday,” said Ho Woei
Chen, an economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in  Singapore .
“The central bank allowed the baht to appreciate last year to
control inflationary pressures. People are watching how much
more the central bank wants to tolerate” gains in the currency,
she said.  The baht advanced 0.1 percent to 30.71 per dollar as of
3:15 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency increased 11 percent last year, the second-best
performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the
yen.  Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said in
January that policy makers need to raise  interest rates  further
to damp inflation. The central bank’s policy has lifted
borrowing costs four times since the start of July to 2.25
percent.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bonds due December 2015 was
unchanged at 3.46 percent today, according to Bloomberg data.  The one-year onshore interest rate swaps, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, rose one basis points to
2.335 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate
was at the highest level since June 2009.
