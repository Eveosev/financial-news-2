Turkish police detained writer Soner
Yalcin and three other journalists in a morning raid on offices
and homes linked to the Oda TV televsion channel, Hurriyet
newspaper reported.  The raid was ordered by prosecutors working on the trial of
senior generals, academics, journalists and businessmen who are
accused of plotting to destabilize Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip
Erdogan ’s government through armed attacks, the Istanbul-based
newspaper reported.  Kemal Kilicdaroglu, head of the main opposition party, said
the detentions showed that Yalcin’s work as a historian and
writer had upset the ruling party, the newspaper reported.   Police had been tracking the targets at Oda TV for eight
months, Hurriyet said. They took documents, books, and digital
records from Yalcin’s home, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
