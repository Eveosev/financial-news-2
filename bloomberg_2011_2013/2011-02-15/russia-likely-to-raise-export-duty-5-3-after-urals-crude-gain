  Russia  may increase its export duty
on most crude shipments by 16 percent on April 1 to the highest
level since the September 2008 financial crisis.  The standard  tax rate  will probably rise to $423.70 a
metric ton ($57.80 a barrel) from $365 a ton in March, according
to Bloomberg calculations based on Finance Ministry data. The
discounted rate on oil pumped via Russia’s East Siberian-Pacific
Ocean pipeline to  Asia  and from the  Caspian Sea  may climb to
$191 a ton from $150.40.  Brent and Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, have
traded above $100 a barrel during the past month, the highest
since 2008, as unrest in northern  Africa  and the Middle East
disrupted some oil flows. Russia taxed oil exports at $495.90 a
ton in August and September 2008.  Russia sets its export duties based on the average Urals
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th day of the
next. Urals averaged $108.16 during the most recent monitoring
period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance Ministry adviser, said by
phone today.  The export tax on light oil products may be increased to
$283.90 a ton from $244.60 a ton. The duty on heavy products may
rise to $197.90 a ton from $170.40 a ton.  The rate for liquefied petroleum gases including propane
and butane may decline to $91 a ton, compared with $150.20 a ton
in March.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign off on the duties
for them to come into effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
