Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  as corn declined and on speculation demand will
increase as the U.S. approaches spring.  The grain-based additive was steady after an Agriculture
Department report showed the area planted with corn may rise 4.3
percent to 92 million acres, the most since 2007. Ethanol, made
from corn, is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and meet
federal mandates.  “It’s good news that ethanol was flat and corn’s down,”
said Justin Dirico, senior ethanol trader at SCB & Associates
LLC in Chicago. “People are being smart. We’re coming into a
driving season.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery declined 0.3 cents to
$2.444 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures are 43
percent higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf lost 2
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.505 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive slipped 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.42, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  fell 0.5 cent to $2.535 a gallon and on
the West Coast the biofuel slid 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$2.545.  Corn futures for May delivery dropped 5.5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $7.01 a bushel in Chicago. Yesterday, the price
touched $7.21, the highest level since July 9, 2008. Before
today, the most-active futures surged 89 percent in the past
year as bad weather reduced global production and demand rose.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are losing 9 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 6 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
