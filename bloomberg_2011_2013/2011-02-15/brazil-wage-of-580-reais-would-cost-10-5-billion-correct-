(Corrects amount of addition to budget in first paragraph.)  A Brazil minimum monthly wage of 580
reais ($348) in 2010 would add 10.5 billion reais to the
government’s outlays, Deputy Finance Minister Nelson Barbosa
said.  “There is no space for additional costs without
compromising public accounts,” Barbosa said at a meeting with
members of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party in Brasilia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
