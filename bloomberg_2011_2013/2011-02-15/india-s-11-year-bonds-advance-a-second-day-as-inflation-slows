  India ’s 11-year bonds, the most-
traded government debt, gained a second day on speculation
investors will buy debt as slowing inflation may boost demand
for fixed-income securities.  Yields fell to their lowest level in more than two weeks
after the commerce ministry said yesterday the wholesale-price
index rose 8.23 percent from a year earlier after an 8.43
percent jump in December. Average daily borrowings by the
nation’s lenders from the central bank have declined to 716
billion rupees ($16 billion) this month from 913 billion rupees
in January, data from the  Reserve Bank  of India show.  “Debt investors are probably encouraged by the softening
of inflation, which may increase their returns,” said R.S.
Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer at  State Bank  of Bikaner &
Jaipur. “The easing of liquidity is also spurring some
buying.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent note due August 2022 dropped
one basis point to 8.18 percent as of 9:45 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Ten Indian state governments plan to raise a total of 70.88
billion rupees ($1.6 billion) selling 10-year debt at an auction
today, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement on Feb.
