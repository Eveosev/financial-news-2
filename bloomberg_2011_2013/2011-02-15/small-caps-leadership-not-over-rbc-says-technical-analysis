Small companies signaled last month
that they will continue to outpace the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, according to RBC Capital Markets Corp.  The  Russell 2000 Index ’s relative price ratio to the  S&P
500  didn’t fall below an uptrend line that’s been in place since
1999, according to RBC and Bloomberg data. That suggests small-
cap stocks may have the momentum to continue their leadership,
said Robert Sluymer, who studies price charts and trading
patterns at RBC.  Sluymer’s view puts him at odds with analysts including
Oppenheimer & Co.’s Brian Belski who say large companies
represent a better bet because small-cap stocks are too
expensive. Companies in the S&P 500 on average traded at 16
times their earnings, less than half the Russell 2000’s multiple
of 35, Bloomberg data showed.  “Despite many advisors forecasting a rotation to large-
caps, there is very little supporting technical evidence,”
Sluymer wrote in a note dated yesterday. “Small-cap leadership
remains firmly intact despite noise to the contrary.”  The  Russell 2000  has outperformed the S&P 500 since 1999,
with their relative price ratio rising to 0.6301 in December,
the highest since at least 1991, Bloomberg data showed. The
ratio slipped to as low as 0.6025 last month, when the small-cap
index declined 0.3 percent and the S&P 500 rose 2.3 percent.  “A break below the January relative performance lows would
be needed to question the established relative performance
trend,” Sluymer said. “It is premature to conclude a
meaningful rotation to large-caps is underway until lower
relative lows develop.”  The Russell 2000 has surged 141 percent since the S&P 500’s
12-year low in March 2009, exceeding the benchmark’s 97 percent
gain. The small-cap index yesterday closed at 825.90, 2.3
percent below its all-time high of 845.72 on Oct. 9, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Lu Wang  in  New York  at   lwang8@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
