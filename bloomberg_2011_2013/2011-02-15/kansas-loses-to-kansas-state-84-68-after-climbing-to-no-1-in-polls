The  University of Kansas  lost to
rival  Kansas State  University 84-68 on the same day the Jayhawks
climbed to the No. 1 ranking in college basketball’s national
polls.  Senior guard Jacob Pullen scored a career-high 38 points
last night to lead Kansas State to its third win against Kansas
in their past 45 meetings. The crowd in Manhattan, Kansas,
stormed the court in celebration when the final buzzer sounded.  “I really just wanted to be efficient and take good
shots,” Pullen, who was 5-of-6 on 3-point attempts, said in a
televised interview. “Some shots fell and I just got into a
rhythm.”  Kansas State’s win came 16 days after the Wildcats were
routed 90-66 at  Kansas . The Wildcats shot 56 percent yesterday
after hitting 34 percent of their shots in the first meeting.  Kansas fell to 24-2 with the loss, which came less than 12
hours after the Jayhawks moved to No. 1 in the Associated Press
media poll and the  USA Today /ESPN coaches’ poll.  Kansas now has a 9-2 record in the Big 12 Conference, where
Texas remains unbeaten at 10-0 and is 22-3 overall. Texas could
take over as the No. 1 next week -- the Longhorns are ranked
second by the coaches and third by the AP behind Kansas and Ohio
State (24-1).  Kansas State improved to 17-9 overall and 5-6 in the Big
12.  The Wildcats opened a 42-33 halftime lead and pulled away
after withstanding a run by Kansas early in the second half.
Kansas State led by 20 points with about four minutes remaining.  “We knew they were going to make a run, we just wanted to
stay the course,” Pullen said. “We happened to make shots,
which we didn’t do the last time we played.”  Tyrel Reed scored 14 points to lead Kansas, which had been
26-1 in  Manhattan  since 1984. Marcus Morris added 13 points for
the Jayhawks, while twin brother Markieff Morris was limited to
season lows of three points and no rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
