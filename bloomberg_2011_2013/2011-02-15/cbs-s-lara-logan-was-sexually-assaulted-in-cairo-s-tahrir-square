CBS News correspondent Lara Logan
was sexually assaulted and beaten on Feb. 11 at Cairo’s Tahrir
Square, where she was covering Egypt President  Hosni Mubarak ’s
resignation for “60 Minutes,” CBS said on its website.  Logan, who was attacked after she was separated from her
crew, was rescued by a group of women and about 20 Egyptian
soldiers, CBS said. She is back in the U.S., recovering in a
hospital.  CBS said it won’t comment further on the matter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
