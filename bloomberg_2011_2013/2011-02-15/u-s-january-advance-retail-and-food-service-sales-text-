Following is the text of the
monthly retail sales report from the Commerce Department.  Intention to Revise Retail Estimates: Monthly retail
sales
Estimates will be revised based on the results of the 2009
Annual Retail Trade Survey. Revised not adjusted estimates
and
Corresponding adjusted estimates are scheduled for release
on
April 29, 2011.  The U.S. Census
Bureau announced
today that advance
estimates of U.S.
retail and food
services sales for
January, adjusted
for seasonal
variation and
holiday and trading-
day differences, but
not for price
changes, were $381.6
billion, an increase
of 0.3 percent(+/-
0.5%)* from the
previous month, and
7.8 percent (+/-
0.7%) above January
2010. Total sales
for the November
2010 through January
2011 period were up
7.6 percent (+/-
0.5%) from the same
period a year ago.
The November to
December 2010
percent change was
revised from +0.6
percent (+/-0.5%) to
+0.5 percent (+/-
0.3%).  Retail trade
sales were up 0.5
percent (+/-0.5%)*
from December 2010,
and 8.3 percent
(â–’0.7%) above last
year. Auto and other
motor vehicle
dealers sales were
up 16.7 percent (+/-
2.3%) from January
2010 and nonstore
retailers sales were
up 13.5 percent (+/-
3.1%) from last
year.  The advance
estimates are based
on a subsample of
the Census Bureau's
full retail and food
services sample. A
stratified random
sampling method is
used to select
approximately 5,000
retail and food
services firms whose
sales are then
weighted and
benchmarked to
represent the
complete universe of
over three million
retail and food
services firms.
Responding firms
account for
approximately 65% of
the MARTS dollar
volume estimate. For
an explanation of
the measures of
sampling variability
included in this
report, please see
the Reliability of
Estimates section on
the last page of
this publication.  The Advance Monthly
Sales for Retail and
Food Services for
February is
scheduled to be
released March 11,
2011 at 8:30 a.m.
EST.  For information, visit the Census Bureau's Web site at
< http://www.census.gov/retail >.  * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero.
The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical
evidence to conclude
That the actual change is different than zero.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department
