(Corrects story published yesterday to show  credit line  is
replacing existing facility in first paragraph, wording of
quotation in third paragraph.)    Bayer AG ,  Europe ’s largest drug and
chemical maker, named three banks to arrange a 3.5 billion-euro
($4.7 billion) credit line to replace an existing facility a
year ahead of schedule, according to a company spokesman.  BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc are arranging the five-year revolving credit, which
can be extended by as much as two years, said Christian Hartel,
a spokesman for the Leverkusen, Germany-based company.  “The margin is linked to a rating grid,” Hartel said
today in a telephone interview. “According to our current A-
rating, the margin is set in the low-40s basis points.” He
declined to be more specific.  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings rank Bayer’s debt A-.
while Moody’s Investors Service rates it A3.  The company agreed in 2005 to pay interest at 20 basis
points more than the euro interbank offered rate on money drawn
under the revolving credit due in 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Companies keep credit lines to guarantee debt such as
commercial paper for day-to-day operations. They typically don’t
draw on the loans.  To contact the reporters on this story:
