Domino’s Pizza U.K. & Ireland Plc
said full-year profit fell 28 percent after the U.K.’s biggest
pizza-delivery company took a one-off credit of 15 million
pounds the previous year when it bought Domino Leasing Ltd.  Net income for the 52 weeks ended Dec. 26 declined to 24
million pounds ($38 million), or 14.85 pence a share, compared
with 33.5 million pounds, or 20.95 pence a share, a year earlier
the  Milton Keynes , England-based company said in a statement
today.  Group revenue climbed 21 percent to 188 million pounds, and
Domino’s full-year pretax profit rose 27 percent to 38 million
pounds.  Online system sales jumped 63 percent to 128 million pounds
during the period as more Britons stayed home, Domino’s said.
Sales in 553 stores open at least a year rose 11.9 percent as
customers took advantage of meal deals such as ‘Two for
Tuesday.’  “We have had a solid start to 2011, with like-for-like
sales for the first seven weeks up 4.7 percent and are
encouraged by the recent strength in like-for-like sales
growth,” Chief Executive Officer Chris Moore said in the
statement, “This figure comes against the backdrop of
exceptional comparatives from the same period in 2010 and the
current difficult economic climate.”  Domino’s may pass on a 1 percent to 2 percent increase in
food costs to franchises this year, Lee Dale Ginsberg, chief
financial officer, said by phone today. Energy and utility costs
have been locked in for two years, Ginsberg added.  Domino’s sees a 2 percent to 3 percent rise in the market
consensus figure for 2011, Ginsberg said. The 2011 pretax profit
forecast has been raised by 2 percent to 42.5 million pounds,
according to Numis Securities Ltd, the house broker.  The shares slipped 20.5 pence, or 3.9 percent, to 502.5
pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , giving the company a
market value of 808.8 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
