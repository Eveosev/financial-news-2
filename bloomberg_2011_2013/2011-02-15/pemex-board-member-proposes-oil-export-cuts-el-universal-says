  Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned
company, should cut crude exports by 71 percent to 400,000
barrels a day to boost domestic refining, board member Fluvio Ruiz said, according to  El Universal .  Pemex, as the oil producer is known, needs to reduce
exports and pay less tax to invest more in refining capacity,
the Mexico City-based newspaper said today, citing a statement
from Ruiz.  Pemex, the second-largest supplier of oil to the U.S. after  Canada , exported 1.361 million barrels of crude a day in 2010.  Mexico should trim the companyâ€™s taxes by 15 percent to 20
percent over the next decade, Ruiz told El Universal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
