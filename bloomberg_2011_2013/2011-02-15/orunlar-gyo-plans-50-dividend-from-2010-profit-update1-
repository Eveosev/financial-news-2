  Torunlar Gayrimenkul Yatirim
Ortakligi AS , a Turkish real estate investment trust, will pay a
50 percent dividend from 2010 profit and is asking more foreign
institutional investors to buy up its publicly held stock, said
Aziz Torun, chairman of the company.  Torunlar GYO will pay the dividend after a shareholders
meeting in March, Torun said in an interview in Istanbul today.
The company also plans 850 million liras ($533 million) of
investment within three years, he said.  “We are now having a road show with international funds
and other foreign investors to attract more investment to our
company,” Torun said. “When international investors hold about
70 percent of a company’s free float that stock becomes
deeper.”  Torunlar sold a 25 percent stake last year through an
initial public offering. Foreign investors own about 20 percent
of that stake, he said.  Torunlar fell 2 kurus, or 0.3 percent, to 6.56 liras at
4:46 p.m. on the  Istanbul Stock Exchange . It rose as much as 0.6
percent earlier, after Torun spoke.  To contact the reporter on this story:
