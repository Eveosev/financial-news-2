The Muslim Brotherhood,  Egypt ’s
largest political opposition group, said it plans to establish
itself as a formal party in anticipation of legal changes that
may permit it to take part in elections.  The party will be formed “at the nearest possible
opportunity,” the group’s spokesman, Mohamed Morsey, said in a
telephone interview today.  The Muslim Brotherhood waited two days before saying it
would join the protests that led to the fall of President  Hosni Mubarak  on Feb. 11. The group said it shared the goals of the
hundreds of thousands who rallied for 18 days, including seeking
an end to Mubarak’s 30-year rule, a new constitution, an end to
the country’s emergency law, open elections and a new, all-party
government.  The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will run Egypt
during a transition period or until elections can take place, it
said in a statement yesterday. The Muslim Brotherhood said Feb.
12 that it supported the army’s role in the peaceful transfer of
power to a civilian government.  Under Mubarak’s rule, the Brotherhood was banned from
politics in Egypt, and members have had to run for office as
independents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
