More than 14.5 percent of shops in
U.K. high streets are vacant, compared with fewer than 6 percent
two years ago, and there is little prospect of improvement,
according to a survey of 750 town centers by the Local Data
Company, the London-Based Times reported.  Vacancy rates in the South average 12.3 percent, compared
with 16.5 percent in the Midlands and North, and smaller town
centers are doing better than larger ones, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
