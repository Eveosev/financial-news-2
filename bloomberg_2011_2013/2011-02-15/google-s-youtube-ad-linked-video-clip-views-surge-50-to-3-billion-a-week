  YouTube  is running advertisements on
videos more than 3 billion times a week, a 50 percent increase
from May, helping  Google Inc . wring more revenue from its
largest acquisition.  Ad growth for the video-sharing website has also led to a
surge in sales for makers of video clips for the site, said
Shishir Mehrotra, director of product management at YouTube. The
gain in ad-supported video views means that the company is
making money on about one-fifth of its 14 billion weekly views,
he said.  “A lot of it is based on growing ad products as well as
growing inventory,” Mehrotra said in an interview. “Our
partners are starting to see real success on the platform, and
so they’re starting to invest.”  YouTube, which competes with premium-content site Hulu LLC
and rental service  Netflix Inc ., is trying to expand revenue by
keeping viewers on its site longer to woo more advertisers and
create another billion-dollar business for Google, owner of the
No. 1 search engine. YouTube more than doubled sales last year,
beating total U.S. display-based advertising growth of 17
percent, according to researcher EMarketer Inc.  “Independently, it’s not going to be a game-changer, but
it’s part of the non-search growth that investors are looking
for,” said  Aaron Kessler , an analyst at ThinkEquity LLC.
“Longer-term you want to have more branded content or more
professional content to drive growth.” Kessler rates Google
stock a buy and doesn’t own the shares.  Revenue, Margin  YouTube probably brought in about $710 million in revenue
last year, up from $345 million in 2009, according to Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst at Caris & Co. Mountain View, California-
based Google doesn’t break out YouTube’s sales.  Aggarwal also said YouTube likely reached profitability
last year. While the unit’s operating margin may be about 35
percent, it’s still about half of the margin in Google’s core
search business, where the company places ads next to query
results.  Ad-supported video views are a key metric for the financial
health of the company, Mehrotra said. YouTube first reached 3
billion ad-supported views weekly in October after hitting 2
billion in May 2010 and 1 billion in 2009, he said.  Google, mostly due to YouTube, had more than 80 percent of
the U.S. market for Internet-video views in December, making it
the largest viewing site, according to ComScore Inc. No. 2
Yahoo! Inc. had 37 percent as many views as Google.  Comedy Skits, Dance Numbers  Content providers, who as a group upload more than 35 hours
of video per minute to the site, make money from YouTube by
allowing advertising with their videos as they grow in
viewership. YouTube also attracts advertising dollars for its
home page, where visitors often begin their sessions on the
site.  Shay Butler, who posts video clips including comedy skits
and dance numbers from Pocatello,  Idaho , said he could quit his
work in granite-countertop fabrications and installations
because of YouTube. Butler makes money on shared revenue from
YouTube and product placements in his videos. He says he made at
least $100,000 last year thanks to his clips, and his videos
have been viewed more than 250 million times.  “Back when I started, I didn’t know you get paid,” he
said, noting his first check from YouTube was for less than
$500. “YouTube advertising is getting better. People are
starting to see the value.”  Alternative to TV  As part of its push to draw more advertising, YouTube is
trying to position itself as an alternative to television.
That’s a tough sell for a site better known for cat videos and
babies burping, said Paul Verna, an analyst with  EMarketer  in
Kennebunk,  Maine .  “When you say a YouTube video, that means a short, user-
generated clip,” Verna said.  Last year, YouTube hired Robert Kyncl, a former Netflix
executive, to head up YouTube’s TV and film-entertainment
efforts. He’s helping to bring more live-streamed content that
makes the channel feel more like TV.  The company is also forming partnerships with sponsors that
want to offer exclusive content.  American Express Co . has been
working with YouTube for the last four or five years, said
Courtney Kelso, the credit-card issuer’s vice president of media
and sponsorship marketing. The company has sponsored a concert
series on the site featuring such artists as Arcade Fire, John Legend and Sugarland. American Express also has spent money on
advertising on YouTube.  “It helps us capitalize on the viewer migration from
broadcast TV to the more narrowcast-video viewing. We find it
drives online buzz,” Kelso said. “We would definitely be
looking to continue our significant level of investment -- and
even increase when great opportunities arise.”  Sports, Entertainment  The company needs to do more to keep its viewers on the
site for longer than the average daily 15-minute session,
compared with the multiple hours consumers spend in front of
televisions, said Hunter Walk, director of  product management  at
YouTube. That involves efforts such as the Leanback service
unveiled last year, which predicts what YouTube channels users
want to see based on prior views.  “We need to get the point where YouTube is where you go
when you just want to watch video, period,” Walk said.  YouTube has tried to distinguish itself by offering
programming such as sports, including the Indian Cricket League
and showing Major League Baseball games in Japan, where major TV
broadcasters don’t feature the sporting events.  Targeting Users  As YouTube expands its programming, advertisers also are
getting help targeting users based on their interests, through a
program started last year. And in December the company rolled
out a new ad format called TrueView, which only charges
advertisers when users choose to watch an ad. Now, advertisers
can more easily invest in spots that are gaining viewer
attention, Mehrotra said.    Hewlett-Packard Co . has done traditional advertising on the
site and recently sponsored a live-streamed event that featured
a new printer and comedy sketches, said Tariq Hassan, HP’s vice
president of worldwide marketing and communications.  “It’s been an opportunity for us to experiment, obviously,
with the younger digital generation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
