  JPMorgan Chase & Co . racked up a
perfect trading record for the second half of last year, making
money every day after accomplishing the same feat in the first
three months of the year.  Traders at the New York-based bank made an average of
$76 million a day last year, down from $84 million in 2009,
according to an investor presentation today at the bank’s New
York headquarters. The investment bank lost money on eight days
last year, all in the second quarter.  “We don’t expect that to be repeated,” said Jes Staley,
chief executive officer of the investment bank. “I imagine I’ll
be up here next year and you’ll see a number higher than eight,
but I think it underscores how well we’ve been managing our
business.”  By comparison, JPMorgan had 42 days of losses in 2009, 97
in 2008, 46 in 2007, 33 in 2006 and 52 in 2005, according to the
presentation. JPMorgan’s average daily trading revenue was
$21 million in 2008, $39 million in 2007, $47 million in 2006
and $37 million in 2005, according to the data.  Banks have relied on trading profit to make up for weak
earnings or losses tied to consumer banking.  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based Bank of America Corp., which hasn’t reported its
fourth-quarter trading results yet, also posted perfect trading
records in the first and third quarters. Traders at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and  Citigroup Inc . also made money every single
day in the first quarter.  U.S. Role  The perfect trading results are rare and were primarily
driven by the Federal Reserve’s programs buying mortgage bonds
and U.S. Treasury securities. That’s driven trading volumes
higher, boosted asset values and provided backup liquidity in
the markets, analysts say.  “It gives traders a buyer of last resort and confidence
that they have an outlet if some goes wrong,” said  Paul Miller ,
a former examiner for the  Federal Reserve  Bank of Philadelphia
and analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. He
said the strategy keeps bears on the sidelines in the fixed-
income markets. The results are “driven by the Fed, not really
any expertise of any trading desk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
