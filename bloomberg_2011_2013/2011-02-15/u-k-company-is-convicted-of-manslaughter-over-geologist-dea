Cotswold Geotechnical Holdings Ltd.
became the first U.K. company to be convicted of corporate
manslaughter after the death of a junior geologist who died
while working on a project in 2008.  The company was found guilty by a jury in Winchester,  England , the U.K. Crown Prosecution Service said today in a
statement. The geologist, Alexander Wright, 27, was taking soil
samples in an excavated pit when the sides collapsed, crushing
him, according to prosecutors.  “The jury found that their system of work in digging trial
pits was wholly and unnecessarily dangerous,” the prosecutors
said in the statement. “The company ignored well-recognized
industry guidance that prohibited entry into excavations more
than 1.2 meters deep.”  The case is the first corporate manslaughter charge filed
under a 2007 U.K. law, prosecutors said. Cotswold Geotechnical
will be sentenced Feb. 17. A call to the Gloucester, England-
based company wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter for this story:
