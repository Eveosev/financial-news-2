China’s January inflation data to be
released today will reflect a reduced weighting for food in the
consumer-price index, the  China  Securities Journal reported,
citing an unidentified statistics bureau official.  While China makes minor changes to CPI weightings each year,
the latest moves are part of a more thorough adjustment every
five years, the newspaper cited the official as saying.  The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.5 percent
yesterday, the most in two months, on speculation the
inflation number was lower than forecast after the bureau
altered calculation methods. Food has accounted for about a
third of the index and was the main driver of China’s inflation
last year. January’s numbers are due to be released at 10 a.m.
in Beijing.  Consumer prices rose 5.4 percent last month from a year
earlier, the most in 30 months, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
Speculation that the number will be 4.9 percent was cited
yesterday by Central China Securities Co. and Deutsche Bank
AG.  --Li Yanping. Editors: Paul Panckhurst, Peter Hirschberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
