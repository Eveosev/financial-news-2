Bulgaria’s inflation rate remained
unchanged in January, as fuel and food prices in the European
Union’s poorest country were stable.  The annual rate was 4.5 percent, the National Statistics
Institute in Sofia said today in a statement on its website. The
median estimate of three economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a rate of 4.8 percent. Prices rose 0.6 percent in the month.  Bulgaria overshot the government’s 2010 inflation target of
3.2 percent as the country recovered from a recession and rising
global commodity prices pushed up food and transport costs. The
government forecast an average inflation rate of 3.6 percent for
this year. Factory-gate prices advanced an annual 12 percent in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
