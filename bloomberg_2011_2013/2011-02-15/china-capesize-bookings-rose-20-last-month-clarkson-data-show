Bookings for capesize vessels to
deliver cargoes to  China  rose 20 percent last month, according
to figures from a unit of the world’s biggest shipbroker.  Raw-materials producers and traders hired 65 such vessels
to make shipments to China, compared with 54 in December, data
from  Clarkson Research Services Ltd.  showed. Capesizes typically
haul coal and iron ore to make steel. China is the world’s
biggest steel producer.  The data provide a snapshot of single-voyage, or spot,
charters. They exclude long-term freight contracts that
commodity producers and  steel mills  may have in place, and may
be incomplete because brokers and traders are free to leave
shipping deals unreported.  Lease rates for capesizes dived 70 percent in January to
$5,910 a day, according to the  Baltic Exchange  in  London . That
compares with operating costs of about $7,000 as estimated by
Dag Kilen, an analyst at RS Platou Markets AS in Oslo. The ships
are too big to fit through the Panama Canal and must sail around
South America’s Cape Horn or South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope.  Capesizes, the largest vessels tracked by the Baltic Dry
Index of commodity-shipping costs, have a carrying capacity of
at least 100,000 deadweight tons, according to Clarkson Research
Services, a unit of London-based Clarkson Plc.  -- Editor: John Deane  To contact the reporter on this story:
