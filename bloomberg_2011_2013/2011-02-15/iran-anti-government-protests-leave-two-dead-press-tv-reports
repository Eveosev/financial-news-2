Two people were killed and several
injured in anti-government protests in the Iranian capital,
inspired by uprisings in Tunisia and  Egypt ,  Iran ’s Press TV
 reported  today.  Several people were injured in Tehran, including nine
security officers, after security forces opened fire on
protesters, the television station reported, citing Deputy
Police Chief Brigadier General Ahmad Reza Radan. Iran’s
government banned the protests, Press TV said, since “the
Iranian people already expressed their solidarity with the
Egyptians and Tunisians on Feb. 11.”  Supporters of the Iranian government also demonstrated
today against the opposition, Press TV said.  Pro-government legislators today chanted “death to
Mousavi, Karroubi and Khatami,” accusing opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi, Mahdi Karroubi and former reformist President
Mohammad Khatami of organizing the protests, the  Associated
Press  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
