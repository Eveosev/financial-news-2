Jean Baptiste Compaore, the interim
governor of the  Central Bank  of West African States, said more
banks are likely to close in Ivory Coast as the country’s
financial system deteriorates.  Compaore was speaking to reporters late yesterday in
Ouagadougou, the capital of  Burkina Faso , after meeting that
country’s President Blaise Compaore.  BNP Paribas and Citigroup Inc. have closed their branches in
Ivory Coast in the past week, with Paribas’ unit citing security
concerns and legal and regulatory confusion for its decision.
The regional central bank on Feb. 10 demanded banks halt all
transactions with its agencies in Ivory Coast after they were
seized by President Laurent Gbagbo.  “We are no longer able to guarantee our activities in
satisfactory conditions in terms of legal and accounting
security for our clients, nor in terms of physical security for
our employees,” Paribas’ unit, BICICI, said in a letter
published on its website.    Ivory Coast  has been gripped by a political crisis since
the electoral commission named  Alassane Ouattara , 69, the winner
of the Nov. 28 presidential election, and Gbagbo, 65, refused to
concede defeat, alleging voter fraud. The regional central bank
has refused to continue transactions with Gbagbo’s
administration, leading the government to seize their offices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
