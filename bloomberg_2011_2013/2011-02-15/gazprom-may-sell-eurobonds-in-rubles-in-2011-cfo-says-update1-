OAO Gazprom may sell eurobonds in
rubles this year, said Chief Financial Officer Andrei Kruglov.  Moscow-based Gazprom plans to borrow an equivalent of 90
billion rubles ($3.1 billion) in various facilities this year in
line with last year, Kruglov said today in  London .  “We are already present at the  bond market  and will try to
maintain our (borrowing) curve and will probably sell bonds,”
he said. “At the same time syndicated loans sometimes are
cheaper for the borrower than bonds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
