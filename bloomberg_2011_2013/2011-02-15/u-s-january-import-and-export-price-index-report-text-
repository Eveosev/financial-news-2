The following is the text of the
U.S. import and export  price index  report from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.  The price index for U.S. imports increased 1.5 percent in
January, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today,
as higher prices for fuel and nonfuel imports each contributed
to the advance. U.S. export prices rose 1.2 percent in
January, following increases of 1.5 percent in November and
0.6 percent in December.  Imports  All Imports: Import prices advanced 1.5 percent in January,
and for the first time since July 2008 the index advanced at
least 1.0 percent for four consecutive months. Import prices
increased 5.3 percent over the past year, the largest 12-month
advance for the index since an 8.5 percent rise between May
2009 and May 2010. In addition to contributing to the January
price increases, higher fuel and nonfuel prices also both
contributed to the 12 month advance in overall imports.  Fuel Imports: Fuel prices rose 3.9 percent in January, after
rising 14.1 percent over the previous three months. Rising
prices for petroleum and natural gas led the overall increase
in fuel prices in January. Petroleum prices advanced 3.4
percent in January and prices for natural gas surged 13.0
percent, the largest monthly rise for that index since a 17.7
jump in January 2010. Fuel prices advanced 12.4 percent over
the past year, led by a 14.3 percent increase in petroleum
prices. Despite the January rise, natural  gas prices  fell 18.8
percent over the past year.  All Imports Excluding Fuel: The price index for nonfuel
imports increased 0.8 percent in January, with higher prices
for nonfuel industrial supplies and materials, finished goods,
and foods, feeds, and beverages all contributing to the
overall advance. The January increase matched a similar 0.8
percent rise in November, the largest one-month advances for
the index since a 1.1 percent increase in April 2008. Nonfuel
import prices rose 3.4 percent for the year ended in January,
led by a 13.0 percent advance in nonfuel industrial supplies
and materials prices and a 14.8 percent increase in foods,
feeds, and beverages prices.  Exports  All Exports: Export prices increased 1.2 percent in January,
led up by rising prices for both agricultural and

year-over-year advance since a 7.0 percent increase between

supplies and materials.  Import Prices  Nonfuel Industrial Supplies and Materials: Nonfuel industrial
