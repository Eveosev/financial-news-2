Syncrude’s premium weakened after  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd . announced plans to restart two
coker drums at its Horizon oil-sands project in the second
quarter.  The mine and upgrader will operate at about half capacity
until a second set of coker drums resumes operations in the
third quarter, the company said in a statement late yesterday.
The plant halted operations after a fire Jan. 6.  The premium for Syncrude, a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil
derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta, over the benchmark West
Texas Intermediate narrowed 50 cents to $8 at 12:12 p.m. in  New
York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount for
Western Canada Select widened 50 cents to $19.75 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium weakened 25 cents to $19.75
a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 60 cents to
$19.60.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI weakened 10 cents to $13.70 a barrel, while
Poseidon’s premium was unchanged at $14.15 over the benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $12.50.
Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI strengthened 60 cents to $18.90.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 25 cents to $6.75. WTS
is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less influenced
by imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
