  Southern Sudan  will pay the north a
transit fee for the use of a pipeline to carry oil exports,
rather than share oil revenue, when it becomes independent in
July, the secretary-general of the region’s ruling party said.  Northern and Southern Sudan reached the accord during talks
about the secession, Pagan Amum told reporters today in the
regional capital, Juba. The south may also pay the authorities
in Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, a grant to compensate them for
their loss of oil revenue, he said.  “The notion of continuing sharing wealth will not be
there,” Amum said. “There is no continuation, whether 50
percent or anything.”  Northern and Southern Sudan currently split revenue from
oil production in the south, under a 2005  peace agreement  that
ended a two-decade civil war. At independence, Southern Sudan
will assume control of about three quarters of Sudan’s current
oil production of 490,000 barrels a day, pumped mainly by China
National Petroleum Corp. and Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd.  Oil from landlocked Southern Sudan is shipped by pipelines
to  Port Sudan  on the  Red Sea . The oil represents 98 percent of
the southern government’s revenue.  South Sudan also plans to introduce a new currency, called
the pound, Amum said.  Before the south becomes independent on July 9, the two
sides must also reach agreements on international treaties,
debt, border demarcation and the future of the disputed region
of Abyei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
