Siliken SA, the Spanish solar panel
maker that’s preparing for an initial public offering as early
as this year, said it is set to begin producing generators in
Windsor, Ontario, in April to serve the local market.  Siliken has leased a building near Windsor’s airport and is
hiring at least 150 workers as it aims to have four production
lines with 50 megawatts of capacity operating by the end of the
year, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Valencia, Spain-based Siliken already has manufacturing
plants operating in Spain,  Romania  and the U.S. Chairman Carlos Navarro shifted Siliken’s focus to European and North American
markets last year after demand for photovoltaic panels in  Spain 
fell after the government cut subsidies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
