  Ghana ’s currency, the cedi, weakened
against the  U.S. dollar  for the first time in four days as
supplies of the foreign currency by investors outside the
country slowed.  The currency traded at 1.5090 per dollar at 1:30 p.m. in
Accra, from 1.5060 at 9 a.m. this morning, according to data
from Access Bank Ghana Ltd.  “Today there was not much inflow from offshore investors
that want to participate in tomorrow’s auction of three-year
bonds by Bank of Ghana,” Biggles Amponsah, a currency trader at
the lender, said by phone from Accra. Most of the foreign
investors who want to buy into the 400 million cedi ($265.7
million) offer have already transferred their cash, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
