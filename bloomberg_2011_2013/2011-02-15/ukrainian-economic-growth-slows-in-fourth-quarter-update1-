Ukraine’s economic growth
decelerated to the slowest pace in a year, curbed by slower
expansion in western  Europe .  The economy expanded 3 percent in the fourth quarter from
the same period a year earlier, following 3.4 percent annual
growth in the previous three-month period, the Kiev-based
statistics office said on its website today, without providing
any more detailed figures.  Europe’s economy expanded less than economists forecast in
the fourth quarter as cold weather curbed German output and
French growth unexpectedly stalled. Ukraine’s economy expanded
4.2 percent in all of 2010 as prices for metals, a main driver
of exports, rose. That followed a 14.8 percent slump the
previous year, the deepest recession since 1994.  Fourth-quarter gross domestic product increased 1 percent
compared with the previous three months, the statistics office
said. The median estimate of ten economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for 4.1 percent annual growth.  The economy may expand 4 percent to 5 percent this year,
Iryna Akimova, the first deputy chief of President  Viktor
Yanukovych ’s staff, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
