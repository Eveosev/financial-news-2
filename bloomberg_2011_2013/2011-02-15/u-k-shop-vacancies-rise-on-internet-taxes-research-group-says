Shop vacancies in U.K. town centers
increased last year as falling demand and online competition
forced businesses to shut their doors, according to retail
researcher the Local Data Co.  City center vacancies rose to 14.5 percent at the end of
2010 from 12 percent a year earlier, the London-based company
said in a statement. The rate was less than 6 percent in 2008.  A gap between the south of the country and the less-
affluent north is widening, according to the report. Of the top
25 highest-vacancy town centers with more than 400 stores, all
but two are in the Midlands or the North, Local Data said.  Around 10,000 shops will close this year, the company said.
Online retail sales are rising by 20 percent a year and
companies including Arcadia Group Plc and  HMV Group Plc  are
cutting stores and moving to larger units in shopping centers
away from town business districts, Local Data said in the report
said. HMV said on Jan. 5 it will close 60 U.K. stores this year.  “Marked differences in health of towns by location, size
and retailer mix are more apparent than ever,” Matthew
Hopkinson, a Local Data director, said in the report. “These
high streets will never revert back to what they once were.”  U.K. consumer confidence fell by the most since 1994 last
month, a Jan. 28 report by GfK NOP Ltd. showed. Prime Minister  David Cameron  set a goal in October of eliminating 330,000
government jobs and more than three quarters of the record
public deficit by 2015.  Local Data analyses retail data and surveys each store in
800 town centers every six months, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
