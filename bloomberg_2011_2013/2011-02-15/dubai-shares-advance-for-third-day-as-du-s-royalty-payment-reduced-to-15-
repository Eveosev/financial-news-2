Dubai shares rose to the highest in
almost three weeks led by  Emirates Integrated Telecommunications
Co . after the phone company said it will pay lower than expected
royalties to the government.  Emirates Integrated, the United Arab Emirates’ second-
biggest phone company known as Du, increased to the highest
since November 2009. Emirates Telecommunications Corp. climbed
for a second time this week in  Abu Dhabi .  Dubai Islamic Bank
PJSC , the U.A.E.’s biggest Shariah-compliant lender, advanced
3.1 percent. The Dubai Financial Market General Index rose 0.5
percent to 1,615.82, the highest since Jan. 26, at the 2 p.m.
close in the emirate. The  ADX General Index  gained 0.2 percent,  “Telecoms are buoying the U.A.E. markets,” said Shehzad Janab, asset management head at Dubai-based Daman Investments
PSC, which manages more than 5.5 billion dirhams ($1.5 billion).
The government cutting of the Du royalty fee implies a release
of anywhere between 400 million and 500 dirhams and is leading
positive momentum as sell-side analysts factor in the earnings
impact, he said.  The 15 percent of profit royalty payable to the federal
government is effective on Jan. 1, 2010, Du said. “We note that
management had been provisioning for a 50 percent royalty rate
since 2008,”  Shuaa Capital PSC  analysts Simon Simonian and
Rawan Oueidat wrote in a note yesterday. “The announcement
implies the company’s profits prior to 2010 will not be taxed.”  Earnings  Du is expected to announce fourth-quarter results in the
first week of March. Third-quarter profit more than doubled to
163.1 million dirhams, beating estimates, as its client base
grew. The shares rose 3.1 percent to 3.31 dirhams, the highest
since November 2009. They have surged 20 percent over the past
year.  In Abu Dhabi, Emirates Telecommunications, the U.A.E.’s
biggest phone company known as Etisalat, climbed 0.9 percent to
11.20 dirhams. Etisalat comprises 31 percent of the ADX General
Index.  Dubai Islamic increased to 2.35 dirhams, the highest since
Nov. 4.  Oman’s  MSM30 Index  and Kuwait’s SE Price Index decreased
0.1 percent. Qatar’s  QE Index  advanced 0.5 percent while Saudi
Arabia’s measure was little changed at 1:59 p.m. in Riyadh.
