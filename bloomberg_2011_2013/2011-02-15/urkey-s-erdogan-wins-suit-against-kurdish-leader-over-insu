A Turkish court ordered Diyarbakir
Mayor Osman Baydemir to pay 30,000 liras ($18,900) to Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  for offensive language and insults
against him, the state-run Anatolia news agency reported.  Erdogan opened the case in Ankara after Baydemir, mayor of
Turkey’s largest Kurdish-majority city, publicly cursed him in
December 2009, according to press reports at the time. Baydemir
had been arrested along with other Kurdish mayors for suspected
ties to the Kurdistan Workers Party, which  Turkey  considers a
terrorist organization.  Baydemir’s “insults, threats and curses were of such a
degree that they are not protected by the law,” Anatolia quoted
the prosecutor’s complaint as saying. “The defendant’s
expressions and criticisms definitely crossed the lines of
freedom of speech.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
