  Brazil ’s retail sales stalled in
December for the first time since April, as lending slowed on
higher borrowing costs.  Retail sales were flat in December from the previous month,
the national statistics agency said in  Rio de Janeiro .
Economists had expected sales to grow on a seasonally adjusted
basis by 0.4 percent, according to the median forecast from 28
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales increased by 10.1 percent
from a year ago and by 10.9 percent in 2010, the biggest jump
since the series began in 2001.  The yield on the interest-rate future contract due January
2013, the most traded today in Sao Paulo, fell five basis points
to 12.84 percent at 7:20 a.m. New York time, as traders trimmed
bets on interest rate increases. The real strengthened 0.1
percent to 1.6654 per  U.S. dollar .  The slowdown in  consumer spending  may be due to the lagged
effect of three interest rate increases between April and June
last year, when policy makers raised borrowing costs two
percentage points, said  Jankiel Santos , chief economist at
Espirito Santo Investment Bank.  Traders still expect more action from policy makers to curb
inflation, Santos said, speaking by phone from Sao Paulo.  “The market isn’t just going to give up on the need for
further interest rate increases,” Santos said.  Lending Slowdown  State and non-state bank lending expanded 1.6 percent in
December from a month earlier to a 1.7 trillion reais ($1
trillion), the slowest increase since July. Policy makers on
Dec. 3 announced an increase in  reserve requirements  for banks
to slow  consumer lending  and prevent the formation of a credit
bubble.  The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate 0.5
percentage point to 11.25 percent at its January policy meeting.
Policy makers raised the rate to 10.75 percent from 8.75 percent
in 2010, saying the rate increases would take several months to
make their impact felt.  Traders are wagering that the central bank will increase
borrowing costs by 1.5 percentage points to 12.75 percent by
July, to slow inflation that is running at its fastest pace in
more than two years. In the 12 months through January, consumer
prices rose 5.99 percent, the quickest rate since November 2008.
The government targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus
two percentage points.  Supermarket, food and beverage sales fell 0.3 percent in
December, while six of the remaining seven categories posted
growth. It was the first time since April 2010, when sales
declined 3.1 percent, that merchants didn’t sell more than the
previous month.  Vehicle sales jumped 4.7 percent, pushing the broader
retail index up 2.3 percent from November and 14.8 percent from
a year ago.  Inflation Forecast  Analysts raised their 2011 inflation forecast for a 10th
straight week, to 5.75 percent, in a central bank survey of
about 100 economists published yesterday. The economists also
raised their 2012 inflation forecast to 4.7 percent, from 4.61
percent last week.  Unemployment fell to a record low 5.3 percent in December,
after the economy in 2010 grew at 7.3 percent, its fastest pace
in more than 20 years, according to central bank estimates.  Vehicle sales fell to 244,873 in January from a record
381,552 in December, according to the National Vehicle
Manufacturers Association in  Sao Paulo .  To contact the reporters on this story:
