German two-year government notes
dropped as investor confidence increased, the nation’s economy
accelerated and European governments agreed to double the
lending capacity of their rescue fund.  Greek bonds fell for a ninth day after a report showed the
nation’s economy shrank for a 10th consecutive quarter.  Germany ’s gross domestic product grew 4 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, compared with 3.9 percent in the
prior three months, data showed today. Portuguese bonds dropped
as European Union finance ministers said they see no need for
immediate steps to shield the country from the fiscal crisis.  “Higher yields are being supported by the improving
economic fundamentals,” said Rasmus Rousing, a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “In general,
yields have corrected upward and I don’t see anything that could
change that in the near term.”  The yield on the German two-year note rose two basis points
to 1.41 percent at 4:30 p.m. in  London . The 1 percent security
due December 2014 fell 0.025, or 25 euro cents per 1,000-euro
($1,347) face amount, to 99.26. The yield on the 10-year bund,
the euro-region’s benchmark government security, decreased less
than one basis point to 3.29 percent, after climbing to 3.33
percent, the most since Jan. 14, 2010.  German  government bonds  have lost investors 2.1 percent
this year, compared with a 1.2 percent loss for Treasuries,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds returned
4.3 percent, Spanish debt gained 0.8 percent and Irish bonds
earned investors 0.1 percent, the indexes showed.  Aid Mechanism  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in  Mannheim ,
Germany, said its index of investor and analyst expectations,
which aims to predict developments six months in advance, rose
to 15.7 from 15.4 in January. Economists forecast a gain to 20,
according to the median of 38 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Greek 10-year bond yields rose 23 basis points to 11.81
percent. That left the spread versus similar-maturity German
securities at 852 basis points, the most since Jan. 11 based on
closing prices.  The nation’s gross domestic product shrank 1.4 percent in
the fourth quarter from the previous three months, when it
contracted a revised 1.7 percent, the European Union’s
Luxembourg-based statistics office said today.  “The Greek GDP numbers are putting some pressure on Greek
bonds, and adding to the debt worries,” said  Orlando Green ,
assistant director of capital-markets strategy at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment bank in London.  Portuguese Yields  Finance ministers meeting in Brussels late yesterday
decided that the future emergency aid mechanism will be able to
lend 500 billion euros. Germany has opposed stepping up the
rescue effort until governments take fresh measures to bolster
the competitiveness of the 17-nation economy. Germany has put
the focus on getting the full potential out of the temporary
fund, known as the  European Financial Stability Facility .    Portugal ’s 10-year yield increased one basis point to 7.43
percent, leaving the extra yield, or spread, investors demand to
hold the securities instead of similar bunds at 414 basis
points. It reached 438 basis points on Feb. 10, the most since
Nov. 30. Similar-maturity Irish securities yielded 9.22 percent,
seven basis points higher than yesterday.  “The market wants to hear that the EFSF will support the
bonds directly,” Green said. “The absence of an announcement
on the EFSF being used to buy bonds going forward is resulting
in peripherals remaining subdued.”  Spanish Auction  Spanish bonds gained, pushing the 10-year yield down by
three basis points to 5.42 percent. The nation’s borrowing costs
fell at a sale of Treasury bills.  Investors bid for 5.3 times the 1.2 billion euros of 18-
month Spanish bills offered, compared with a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 4.1 at the previous sale in January, according to
Spanish debt office data today. The average yield was 2.938
percent, down from 3.367 percent at the previous sale.  The bid-to-cover ratio on the 5 billion euros of 12-month
bills was 2.1, compared with 2.2 in January, while the average
yield was 2.41 percent versus 2.947 percent.  Belgian 10-year bonds snapped their longest run of declines
since November. The yield fell two basis points to 4.29 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
