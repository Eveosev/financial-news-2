  Canada ’s dollar fluctuated within a
cent of a two-year high against the greenback as crude oil, the
nation’s biggest export, swung between gains and losses.  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, erased gains versus the euro as a
U.S. report showed retail sales rose in January less than
forecast. America is Canada’s biggest trading partner.  “The Canadian dollar is really pushing the limits of
valuation here,” said  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist
at Toronto-Dominion Bank in Toronto. “It can only really trade
significantly higher if we see another significant leg up in  oil
prices .”  The loonie traded at 98.98 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m.
in Toronto, compared with 98.91 cents yesterday, after touching
98.32 cents on Feb. 4, the strongest level since May 2008. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0103.  Crude oil for March delivery decreased 0.5 percent to
$84.38 a barrel in  New York  after earlier gaining 1.4 percent.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent.  The Canadian currency reached its highest level in more
than two years on Feb. 4, when Statistics Canada said employment
increased by 69,200 in January, more than four times the median
forecast of 26 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The  Bank of Canada  has left its benchmark interest rate at
1 percent since boosting it for a third consecutive meeting in
September. BOC Governor  Mark Carney  said in December that
exporters need to regain competitiveness damaged as a
consequence of a rising currency and a global recession by
making new investments to boost productivity.  Trade Surplus    Statistics Canada  reported on Feb. 11 the nation’s first
positive balance of trade in 10 months, a C$3 billion ($3
billion) surplus in December that followed a revised November
deficit of C$115 million.  An index of leading economic indicators for Canada rose 0.4
percent in January after a 0.5 percent increase in the previous
month, according to the median forecast of eight economists
before tomorrow’s report from Statistics Canada.    Government bonds  were little changed today, with the yield
on Canada’s 10-year benchmark down one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.48 percent after touching 3.51 percent,
the highest level since May 18. The 3.50 percent security
maturing in June 2020 gained 5 cents to C$100.18.  The loonie traded at C$1.3349 versus the euro, compared
with C$1.3342, after gaining 0.4 percent. The Canadian currency
traded at 84.62 yen from 84.25 yen, after touching 85.13 yen,
the highest level since Aug. 5.  American Retail  U.S. retail sales rose 0.3 percent last month after a
downwardly revised 0.5 percent advance in December, the Commerce
Department reported. The median forecast of 79 economists was
for a 0.5 percent gain.  “The softer U.S. sales number basically is some sort of
suggestion that it will not be a straight arrow to economic
growth, and that’s obviously hurting the loonie somewhat,” said  Dean Popplewell , an analyst at the online currency trader Oanda
Corp. in Toronto.  To contact the reporter for this story:
