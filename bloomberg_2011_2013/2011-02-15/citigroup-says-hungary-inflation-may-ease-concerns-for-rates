Piotr Kalisz, an economist at
Citigroup Inc. in Budapest, comments on Hungarian inflation,
economic growth and  interest rates .  Inflation slowed to 4 percent in January from 4.7 percent
in December, while economic growth accelerated to an annual 2
percent in the fourth quarter from 1.7 percent in the previous
three-month period, the statistics office in Budapest said
today.  Kalisz made the comments in a note e-mailed to clients
today.  On the inflation outlook  “We expect inflation to moderate in the coming months due
to still negative output gap and favourable base effects.
According to our forecasts the CPI will reach around 3.5 percent
by the end-2011.”  On economic growth:  “Given already published monthly indicators it seems the
second half of 2010 saw significant, albeit still fragile,
recovery in domestic demand. We expect the Hungarian economy to
accelerate in 2011 on the back of fiscal stimulus in the form of
lower personal income taxes. According to our forecasts, GDP
growth could reach 2.7 percent year-on-year in 2011 versus 1.2
percent in 2010.”  On the impact for interest rates”  “Lower inflation in January should help ease concerns of
Hungarian central bankers who were hiking rates in previous
months in an attempt to bring CPI lower. Having said this we
stick to our view that the MPC will leave rates on hold at 6
percent at the February meeting and we expect rates to remain on
hold until the end of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
