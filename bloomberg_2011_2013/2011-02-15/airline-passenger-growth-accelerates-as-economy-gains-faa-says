U.S. airline-passenger numbers will
reach 1 billion in fiscal 2021, two years sooner than projected,
because of improved economic growth, the  Federal Aviation
Administration  said in its annual forecast.  Passenger ranks, which totaled about 713 million in the
year ended in September, will increase at an average annual rate
of 2.8 percent over the next two decades, the FAA said today.
The FAA, which oversees all U.S. civil aviation, conducts the
annual forecast for long-term staffing and equipment planning.  “Only a modernized air transportation system will be able
to keep up with our forecasted demand,” FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in a statement. The FAA has begun an effort dubbed
NextGen to overhaul its ground-based radar system to one that
will rely upon satellites.  The revision marks the first time in more than a decade the
agency moved forward the point at which it predicts 1 billion
passengers. The FAA cited forecasts for an average 2.7 percent
increase in U.S. gross domestic product over 21 years. The FAA
last year estimated GDP growth of 2.6 percent from 2014 to 2030.  Domestic enplanements, or the number of passengers that
board flights within the U.S., will rise 3 percent this year and
then 2.5 percent annually over the next 20 years, the FAA said.
International enplanements will increase 7.8 percent this year
and average 4.3 percent for the remaining forecast period.  Takeoffs and landings will fall 0.6 percent in the current
fiscal year, and then grow at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in
the following 20 years, the FAA projects.  The FAA in 2000 and 2001 predicted the U.S. network would
top 1 billion passengers by 2010. In 2002, the FAA slid that
expected date back to 2013. The FAA in following years moved it
back again -- first to 2015, then to 2016, then to 2021, and
finally, last year, to 2023.  In 2009 the FAA also predicted the 1 billion passenger mark
would be cleared in 2021.  To contact the reporter on this story:
