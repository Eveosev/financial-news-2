Zambia plans to review its minerals
law to make sure companies are environmentally friendly and to
extend the deadline for prospecting licenses, Radio Phoenix
reported, citing Mines and Minerals Minister Maxwell Mwale.  Mining companies will probably be given 10 years for
prospecting rather than 7 years currently, the Blantyre-based
broadcaster cited Mwale as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
