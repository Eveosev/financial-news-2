The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate bonds rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 3 basis
points to 405, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 8 a.m. in
London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1 basis point to 98.75. The cost
of protecting bank bonds from default also increased, with the
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers up 2.5
basis points at 171 and the subordinated index 2 higher at 285.5  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
