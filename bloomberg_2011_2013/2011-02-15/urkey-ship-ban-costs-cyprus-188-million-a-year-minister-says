  Turkey ’s ban on Cypriot-flagged or -
related vessels using its ports is costing the island’s economy
about 138.5 million euros ($188 million) a year, according to
Erato Kozakou-Markoulli, Cyprus’s communications minister.  The Turkish embargo costs the equivalent of 1.3 percent of
Cyprus’s gross domestic product and affects 2,800 vessels, she
said at a conference in Nicosia today, according to a  transcript 
of her speech posted on the government press office website.  These ships are either flagged in Cyprus or are from
elsewhere in the European Union and are managed by companies
based in Cyprus,  Europe ’s largest ship-management center,
Kozakou-Markoulli said.  Cyprus, an EU member since 2004, has been divided for
almost 37 years between its Greek- and Turkish-speaking
communities. Turkey occupied the northern third of the island in
1974 after a coup by supporters of union with  Greece . Since then
Cyprus has been represented by the Greek Cypriot government. The
EU has demanded that Turkey open its ports to Cyprus to be
considered for membership of the bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
