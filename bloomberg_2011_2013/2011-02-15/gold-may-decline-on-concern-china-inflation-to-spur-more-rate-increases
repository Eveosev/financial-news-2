Gold futures climbed to the highest
in almost four weeks as rising consumer prices boosted demand
for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation.  In January,  China ’s inflation accelerated as costs
excluding food rose the most in at least six years, and U.K.
consumer prices rose the most in more than two years.
Billionaire investor  George Soros  increased his SPDR Gold Trust
holdings by 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter, and  John Paulson 
kept his investment unchanged.  “With inflation concerns heating up and the metals
underpinned by a mix of physical and investment demand, it looks
as if further gains are in the pipeline,” James Moore, an
analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London, said in a report.  Gold futures for April delivery rose $9, or 0.7 percent, to
$1,374.10 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price reached $1,377.50, the highest since Jan. 19.
The metal has climbed 26 percent in the past 12 months.  Surging food prices have spurred protests in North Africa
and the Middle East, while Brent crude oil, a global benchmark,
closed yesterday at the highest since September 2008.  “Currency debasement and higher food and energy prices are
leading to an inflation surge in both developed and emerging
markets,” Goldcore Ltd. in Dublin said in a report.  Silver futures for March delivery climbed 16.2 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $30.696 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose $7.10, or 0.9
percent, to $839.90 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Silver and platinum have doubled in the past year.  Platinum futures for April delivery gained $4, or 0.2
percent, to $1,831.60 an ounce on the Nymex. The metal is up 21
percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Nicholas Larkin  in London at
