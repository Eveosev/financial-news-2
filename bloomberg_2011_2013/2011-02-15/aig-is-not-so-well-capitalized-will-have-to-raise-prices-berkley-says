William R. Berkley, chief executive
officer and founder of insurer W.R. Berkley Corp., said bailed-
out rival  American International Group Inc . will have to raise
prices after adding $4.1 billion to reserves for prior claims.  “They were a very aggressive price competitor in the last
few years,” Berkeley said today at an investor conference
hosted by Bank of America Corp. in  New York . “AIG is going to
have to raise prices because they’re not so well capitalized.”  AIG said last week it was adding to reserves, a sign that
it underestimated the cost of claims. Rivals Travelers Cos. and
Chubb Corp. have taken profits after determining they had set
aside more funds than necessary. Reserve additions at AIG,
including $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009, are
weighing on results as Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche 
seeks private capital to repay the $182.3 billion U.S. bailout.  Chubb, based in Warren,  New Jersey , and Liberty Mutual
Holding Co. have said AIG’s government backstop let it sell
policies below competitive rates. AIG’s Pennsylvania regulator
investigated the pricing after the bailout and said in a report
last year that rates were “not out of line” with competitors.  Berkeley’s comments were reported earlier by Dow Jones.
Mark Herr, a spokesman for New York-based AIG, declined to
