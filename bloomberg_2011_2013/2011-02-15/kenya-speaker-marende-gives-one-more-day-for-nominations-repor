Kenya’s Parliamentary Speaker
Kenneth Marende agreed to give a committee of lawmakers another
day to report on whether judicial appointments by President  Mwai Kibaki  were legal.  The justice and legal affairs committee has until 12:30
p.m. tomorrow to produce its report, Marende said in parliament
today in the capital, Nairobi, according to a broadcast on
state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corp.  “We cannot keep the whole country, indeed the house,
waiting eternally,” Marende said. The new deadline is
“absolutely final.”  Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  last month objected to Kibaki’s
nomination of a new chief justice, director of public
prosecution, attorney general and budget controller, citing a
lack of consultation as required by law. The two men agreed to
share power, after violence in East Africa’s largest economy
following a disputed election in December 2007 left 1,500 people
dead.    Kenya ’s committee on finance, planning and trade, which was
considering the appointment of a budget controller, submitted
its report today in parliament, without making it public. The
legal affairs panel is considering the three judicial
nominations.  Ababu Namwamba, chairman of the committee, requested more
time to “consider the question of vetting,” he said in
comments broadcast on state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
