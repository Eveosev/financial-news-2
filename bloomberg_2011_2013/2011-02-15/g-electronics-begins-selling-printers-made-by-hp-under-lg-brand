  LG Electronics Inc . said it began
selling printers made by  Hewlett-Packard Co . under the LG brand
in South Korea to increase sales of computer-related products.  LG has introduced one model since its agreement with HP at
the end of 2010, Sally Lee, a spokeswoman for the Seoul-based
company, said by telephone today. LG was in talks with several
companies, including Palo Alto, California-based HP, the worldâ€™s
biggest maker of printers and computers, Lee said in September.  The Korean company stopped making its own printers in 1998.
It resumed sales of LG-branded printers at the end of 2009 under
a contract with Lexmark International Inc. to make the
equipment, Lee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
