  Citigroup Inc . Chief Executive
Officer Vikram Pandit said emerging markets must prepare for
possible inflation because they’re at “risk of overheating.”  “When you go to the emerging markets, many of them are
operating at or near capacity, and there are risks of
overheating,” Pandit said today at an investor conference in
New York hosted by the brokerage firm ISI Group Inc. “They’re
going to have to deal with inflation.”  Citigroup, the third-largest  U.S. bank  by assets, gets more
than half of its revenue from emerging markets, Pandit, 54,
said. The New York-based company, which had to get a $45 billion
bailout in 2008, is now pursuing a “back-to-basics” strategy
of taking deposits and making loans.  The firm also is targeting the 2.5 billion unbanked people
in the world, one-third of whom have cell phones, Pandit said.
“Reaching those unbanked people will be easier and cheaper
through digital technology.”  Emerging-markets inflation may be “part of the good-news
story” because it’s a sign of growth, Pandit said.  “There are countries where you’ve reached close to the
capacity,” he said. “Their challenge is to figure out how to
increase that capacity.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
