Minori Uchida, senior analyst at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in Tokyo, commented on the
outlook for  China ’s  interest rates , the yuan and  Vietnam ’s dong.  The People’s Bank of China raised its benchmark interest
rates last week for the third time in four months to curb
accelerating inflation. Vietnam devalued the dong by about 7
percent on Feb. 11, the most since at least 1993.  On China:  “With accelerating inflation, China will have to let the
yuan appreciate as intervention to keep the yuan low would cause
too much liquidity. I also expect the central bank to boost
interest rates another three to four times by the end of this
year, by 25 basis points each time. They need both tools to help
curb inflation.  On the dong:  “Unless the trade deficit improves, another devaluation
before year-end is still possible. The deficit may decrease a
bit, but the current level of the dong is not good enough to
turn the deficit into a surplus. The authorities may also let
the dong slide on a daily basis to support exports.”  Forecasts:  The yuan may appreciate to as much as 6.25 per dollar by
the end of this year, Uchida said, a gain of 5.5 percent from
the spot rate of 6.5926 in recent trading. The dong, trading at
20,905 today, may weaken to as low as 23,000 during the same
period, he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
