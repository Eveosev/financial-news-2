OAO Gazprom expects 2011 total
export revenue to top the 2008 record as natural-gas prices
increase and demand for the fuel recovers in Europe.  Gazprom expects total export revenue of $72.4 billion this
year, or $2.5 billion more than the record in 2008, Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Alexander Medvedev said today in  London . That
includes $52.8 billion from exports of natural gas outside the  Commonwealth of Independent States , he said.  Russia’s state-owned Gazprom, which expects European gas
prices to rise 15 percent this year, plans to boost exports to
the region. Sales to Europe are planned at about 152 billion
cubic meters of gas this year, compared with 139 billion cubic
meters last year, according to a presentation to investors
provided to Bloomberg.  “We are already shipping ahead of schedule,” Medvedev
said. Export volumes exceeded planned supplies by 1 billion
cubic meters in January and 500 million cubic meters in the
first 15 days of February, he said. “We are confident.”  Gazprom’s average price for  Europe  will probably rise to
$352 per 1,000 cubic meters this year from $306 last year,
according to the presentation. Gazprom has multi-year contracts
with customers, with prices linked to oil and products and
requirements to take minimal volumes or pay for them. Brent has
risen 42 percent in the past year. Gazprom adapted some of its
contracts last year to allow a portion of gas to be sold at spot
prices and some of the volumes to be delayed.  Take or Pay  Some gas volumes were not taken under the so-called take-
or-pay terms in 2009. The make-up period for this gas will be
between 3 years and 5 years or even longer, Medvedev said.  “There is an insignificant volume of the make-up gas” in
this year’s export plan, he said.  Including liquefied-natural gas swap deals, revenue will
total $72.9 billion this year, Medvedev said.  Gazprom had a 23 percent share of the European gas market
in 2010, where sales accounted for 52 percent of its revenue,
according to the presentation.  Gazprom’s purchases of Central Asian gas this year will be
in line with last year, Medvedev said. Gazprom plans to buy 11
billion cubic meters of gas from  Turkmenistan  this year, about
the same volume as last year.  Gazprom will start filling the Nord Stream pipeline, which
is being built along the  Baltic Sea  to the German coast, in the
summer, Medvedev also said. The first commercial gas will be
supplied to Europe in the fourth quarter. All volumes for the
link have been contracted, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
