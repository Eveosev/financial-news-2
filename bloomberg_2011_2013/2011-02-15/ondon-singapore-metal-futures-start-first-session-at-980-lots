Trading in new copper, zinc and
aluminum reduced-size futures offered by the London Metal
Exchange and  Singapore Exchange Ltd . in the Asian city-state
totaled 980 lots in the first session, an executive said.  “Trade was across-the-board, attracting interest from both
professional traders and end-users,” Chief Executive Officer
Jeremy Ang of the Singapore Commodity Exchange, a unit of  Singapore Exchange , said today by phone.  The new contracts replicate the specifications of so-called
LMEminis, each of which represents 5 metric tons. The first
trading session in Singapore ran from 8 a.m. to 3:20 p.m., and
the second began at 4 p.m. and will end at 2 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
