Sugar fell for a third day in  London 
on speculation supplies from  Brazil , the world’s largest
producer, will increase when the new harvest begins.  Cosan SA Industria & Comercio said yesterday it plans to
boost its capacity for producing sugar and processing cane. It
also said cane output in Center South, Brazil’s main growing
region, may come to as much as 575 million metric tons this
year. Production in the area was 542 million tons in the
previous marketing season, according to figures from the
Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association, or Unica.  “News that Brazil’s Cosan, one of the largest sugar and
ethanol producers in the world, said it would increase sugar
production capacity to 6 million tons from 4 million tons in
five years” pulled prices down, Paul Deane, an economist at  Australia  and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said in a research
note today.  White, or refined, sugar for May delivery fell $11, or 1.5
percent, to $739.50 a ton at 10:08 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
The contract has slid 4.3 percent in three sessions.  Raw sugar for May delivery dropped 0.5 percent to 28.65
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. “Options-related
dealings” contributed to the sweetener’s 2.1 percent retreat
yesterday, Deane said.  Expiring Contracts  “The volatility seen in raw sugar in the last few days
can, at least in part, be attributed to option expiry for the
front month, which occurs today,” Jason Cole, a broker at
Starsupply Renewables SA in Geneva, said by e-mail today.  Center South’s cane production will come to at least 570
million tons this year, said Cosan. It plans to increase sugar
output this year to benefit from higher prices, Chief Executive
Officer Marcos Lutz said. It will raise the portion of cane
turned into sugar above the current 55 percent, he said.  Mills in Center South will produce 33 million tons of sugar
this year, Pedro Mizutani, chief operating officer at Barra
Bonita, Brazil-based Cosan, said yesterday. The region produced
28.6 million tons in 2010-11, Unica data show.  Raw sugar may be poised to fall this month, according to
technical analysis by OptionsXpress Holdings Inc. A lower 14-day
relative-strength index for raw sugar for July delivery and a
gain in the 200-day moving average are a sign that the market is
poised to turn to bearish from bullish, said Mike Zarembski, a
senior commodity analyst at OptionsXpress.  Cocoa for March delivery slipped 0.3 percent to 2,233
pounds ($3,579) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for May delivery fell
0.5 percent to $3,390 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York 
after yesterday reaching $3,444, the highest price for a most-
active contract since January 2010.  Robusta coffee for May delivery gained 0.4 percent to
$2,291 a ton in London. Arabica coffee for May delivery was
little changed at $2.618 a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
