The world’s second-biggest carbon
market is ready to handle a surge in requests for new credits
this year by using regulators more effectively, the new chairman
of the Clean Development Mechanism said.  The program, where rich nations invest in emission-cutting
projects in the developing world in exchange for tradable
credits, will probably receive a 54 percent jump this year in
requests for credits, according to a  presentation published  on
the website of the UN Framework Convention on  Climate Change .  “It’s going to be a mixture” of deploying staffers more
effectively and also drawing on temporary workers who already
helped provide record supply of credits last month, Martin
Hession, the  newly appointed chairman  of the board, said today
in a phone interview from Bonn.  The CDM’s executive board is open to suggestions on how to
improve issuance of credits to renewable-energy projects in
nations that already pay electricity subsidies to windfarms and
hydro plants, Hession said. For instance,  China  may provide new
data at an unspecified time about tariffs it pays in each
region, potentially easing decisions about projects in that
nation, he said.  The board would seek to cut the time it takes to win
approval for new systems that attract credits, known as
 methodologies , Hession said. Some methodologies have been
waiting for more than a year for approval, he said. The board
would seek to cut the time it takes for approval to less than a
year, he said, declining to be more specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
