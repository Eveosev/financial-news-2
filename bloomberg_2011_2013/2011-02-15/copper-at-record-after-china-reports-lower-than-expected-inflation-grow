Copper in London dropped after
reaching a record as  China ’s inflation exceeded the government’s
2011 target for a fourth month, spurring concern the government
may continue tightening, curbing metals demand.  The metal for three-month delivery dropped as much as 1.1
percent to $10,045 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before trading at $10,086.25 at 4:07 p.m. Shanghai time. Earlier
it rose to a record $10,190. Copper for May delivery on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange fell 0.2 percent to close at 76,100
yuan ($11,545) a ton.  “The slide in the afternoon seemed to follow copper in
Shanghai as most China commodities and Shanghai stocks
dropped,” Wang Na, an analyst at Guolian Futures Co., said by
phone from Wuxi. “This could be due to speculation on
tightening policies.”  China’s consumer prices rose 4.9 percent in January from a
year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on its
website today. That compared with a 4.6 percent gain in December
and the median estimate of 5.4 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of 27 economists. China raised borrowing costs and
savings rates on Feb. 8 for the third time since mid-October.  “All these numbers indicate that inflationary pressures
haven’t abated and China has already entered into an era of
structural inflation,” said Liu Li-gang, an Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group economist in  Hong Kong . “This indicates
more monetary policy tightening ahead.”  The statistics bureau reduced the weighting of food in the
index starting from January 2011 amid a drought in the north of
the country. Food previously accounted for a third of the basket
of goods that make up the index and was the main driver of
inflation last year.  China Imports  China’s customs said yesterday inbound shipments of copper
and its products gained 5.7 percent from a month earlier to
364,240 tons in January, while scrap imports fell 16 percent to
360,000 tons last month.  “The copper imports data yesterday was neutral,” Xu said.
“While the arrivals of unwrought copper and copper products
increased, scrap fell, so in terms of copper content it didn’t
vary greatly from a month ago.”  Aluminum in  London  fell 0.5 percent to $2,502 a ton, zinc
declined 0.6 percent to $2,506 a ton, and lead dropped 0.3
percent to $2,633.5 a ton. Nickel lost 0.6 percent to $28,731 a
ton, and tin gave up 0.5 percent to $32,300 a ton.  -  Helen Sun . Editor: Bloomberg News  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
