The  Philadelphia Eagles  placed a
franchise tag on quarterback  Michael Vick  and the  New York Jets 
did the same with linebacker  David Harris , securing the players’
contract rights for the 2011 National Football League season.  The Eagles announced their move on their website, while
Nick Filis, a spokesman for the Jets, confirmed the team’s plans
for Harris in a telephone interview.  Each team in the NFL can apply the franchise tag to one
player whose contract is expiring, preventing them from becoming
free agents. Players designated with the franchise tag receive
one-year contracts equal to the average of the five highest-paid
players at their positions the previous season, under current
rules. The players must accept that contract figure and are
barred from becoming free agents.  Vick would be due $16.4 million and Harris $9.7 million.  It hasn’t been determined whether the franchise tag will be
valid under a new collective bargaining agreement, which is
being negotiated between the NFL and its players union. The
current deal expires March 3.  Vick, 30, threw for 3,018 yards with 21 touchdowns and six
interceptions last season to win the Associated Press Comeback
Player of the Year Award after serving a federal prison sentence
on a dog-fighting conviction.  Harris, 27, led the Jets with 99 tackles and had three
sacks last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
