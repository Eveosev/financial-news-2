U.K. stocks climbed as brokerages
advised buying the shares of  Resolution Ltd ., British Land Plc
and  Land Securities Group Plc , pushing the  FTSE 100 Index  higher
for the first time in three days.  Resolution rallied 6.3 percent as Redburn Partners LLP said
the shares may surge 80 percent. Land Securities and British
Land, the real-estate investment trusts, advanced as HSBC
Holdings Plc upgraded the shares.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index rose 48.19, or 0.8 percent, to
6,085.27 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , near their highest
level since May 2008. The gauge has advanced 3.1 percent this
year, bringing its rally since March 2009 to 73 percent, as
investors bet that a stronger economic recovery will boost
corporate earnings. The  FTSE All-Share Index  advanced 0.7
percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.5 percent.  “If companies continue to hit estimates the market should
be able to push on,” said Rupert Armitage, the head of equities
at Shore Capital Group Ltd., which has about $2.4 billion in
assets. “We don’t see a reason why there should be any weakness
in the market right now.”  The  Bank of England  today forecast that inflation won’t
return to its 2 percent target in two years, saying that higher
commodity prices and an increase in consumer-price expectations
may affect the outlook.  Resolution rallied 6.3 percent to 280.6 pence after Redburn
rated the shares “buy” in new coverage, saying the shares may
rally 80 percent.  British Land Rises  British Land climbed 2.7 percent to 557.5 pence as HSBC
upgraded the shares to “overweight” from “neutral.” Land
Securities gained 3.6 percent to 727 pence as HSBC raised the
shares to “neutral” from “underweight.”  Morgan Crucible Co. rallied 8.1 percent to 299 pence, its
highest price since November 2007. The company that provides
body armor to the U.K. Ministry of Defence said full-year net
income rose to 42.5 million pounds ($68.3 million) from 19
million pounds a year earlier.    Premier Foods Plc  rallied 8.4 percent to 27.9 pence,
leading gains on the FTSE 250 Index, as Credit Suisse Group AG
upgraded the shares of the U.K.’s biggest food manufacturer to
“outperform” from “neutral,” saying the company now has its
“finances under control.”    BHP Billiton Ltd . lost 1.4 percent to 2,464 pence even
after the world’s largest mining company posted a 72 percent
surge in first-half profit and more than doubled its share
buyback program to $10 billion from $4.2 billion in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
