Qatar’s conventional banks want to
merge their Islamic units into a new Islamic bank after the
country’s central bank ordered them to stop offering Shariah-
compliant services by the end of the year,  Al-Sharq said , citing
an unidentified banking official.  Banks that are required to close Islamic units will meet
the Qatar Central Bank in the next two days to discuss the
option, Al-Sharq said. The banks would each own shares in the
new Islamic bank, Al-Sharq said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
