  Centrica Plc , the U.K.’s biggest
energy supplier, is unlikely to be referred to Britain’s  Competition Commission  following a review of price increases,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said.  The company will report 2010 earnings per share around 25.6
pence, a 17 percent increase from 2009, JPMorgan analyst Edmund Reid and Ihor Okhrimenko said in a note to investors today.  Energy regulator Ofgem announced plans in November to
investigate Britain’s energy retail market to ensure customers
are being fairly charged. Margins on an average dual-tariff
energy bill jumped by about 25 pounds to 90 pounds following
price increases in September,  Ofgem said  at the time.  “The Ofgem investigation seems to have created a ‘Catch
22’ in some investors’ minds,” the analysts said today. “The
better Centrica’s financial performance the greater likelihood
of political intervention.”  If a company is found to be violating the Competition Act,
Ofgem has the power to impose financial penalties of up to 10
percent of sales. The regulator plans to finish its review of
the market by the end of next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
