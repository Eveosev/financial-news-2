More than a third of Mauritian
companies expect profits to increase this year, the Mauritius
Employers Federation said.  Of the 94 companies surveyed, 36.1 percent forecast an
increase in earnings, while 26.4 percent expected a decline, the
Ebene-based group said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
survey was conducted between November and January and included
companies with a combined workforce of 30,000 people.  “The outlook for 2011 remains positive,” the federation
said. “45.9 percent of respondents expect higher demand for
their goods and services in the next 12 months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
