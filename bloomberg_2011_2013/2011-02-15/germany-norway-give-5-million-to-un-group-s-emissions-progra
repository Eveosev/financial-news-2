  Germany  and  Norway  together gave $5
million to support the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture
Organization’s program to improve data on greenhouse gas
emissions from agriculture, the  FAO  said.  Norway is contributing $3 million and Germany $2 million to
the mitigation of climate change in agriculture program, the UN
body said today in a statement on its website.  “Having access to improved data will give governments,
development planners, farmers and agribusinesses a tool they can
use to access international funding for mitigation projects and
design and implement policies, programs and practices intended
to reduce agriculture’s GHG emissions,” the FAO said.  Agriculture accounts for around 14 percent of all global
greenhouse gas emissions, according to the FAO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
