U.K. oil company  Soco International
Plc  reported an attack in Block 5 in eastern  Democratic Republic
of Congo  that resulted in one person from a contract security
company being held along with a Congolese soldier.  In a statement on its website, Soco said the security
worker was unharmed and still being held by armed men.  The kidnapping took place yesterday when a convoy of Soco
employees and four Congolese army escorts was attacked near
Virunga National Park, United Nations spokesman Alexandre Essome
said by phone today from Goma, the capital of North Kivu
province where the oil block is located. Other Congolese
soldiers later fought the armed men and freed three troops, he
said.  The park is home to several rebel groups, including members
of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or FDLR,
who are suspected in the attack, Essome said. The park also
overlaps part of Block 5, which Soco is hoping to explore in the
first quarter of this year.  UN peacekeepers found one British national and a Congolese
driver while patrolling the park this morning, Essome said. A
South African national and a Congolese solider are still
missing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
