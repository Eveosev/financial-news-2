SacOil Holdings Ltd. is in talks
with a number of potential investors about its oil block in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and hasn’t yet concluded any
transaction, Chief Executive Officer Robin Vela said.  “Clearly we are in discussions as we are trading under a
cautionary and we will announce to shareholders when there is a
deal,” he said in a mobile phone interview today from
Johannesburg. Vela declined to name any potential investors.  The company wants to develop Block 3 to the same level as
its operations in  Uganda , Vela said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
