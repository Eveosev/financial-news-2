Sugar capped its longest slump in
four months, on signs that supplies may increase in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer. Coffee fell from a 14-year high, and
cocoa also declined.  Cosan SA Industria & Comercio, which shares control of the
largest sugar processor, said yesterday that cane output in
Brazil’s main growing area may be as much as 575 million metric
tons this year. That would mark a 3.4 percent increase from a
year earlier, according to industry data. Today, sugar touched
27.85 cents a pound, the lowest since Dec. 2.  “Any time supply news like this comes out, you’ll see
weakness in the market,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at
Transworld Futures in Tampa.  Raw sugar for May delivery dropped 0.57 cent, or 2 percent,
to settle at 28.21 cents at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . It was the fourth straight decline, the longest slide
since early October. On Feb. 2, the commodity surged to a 30-
year high of 36.08 cents.  In London, refined-sugar futures for May delivery fell
$25.20, or 3.4 percent, to $725.30 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery dropped 0.6 cent,
or 0.2 percent, to $2.611 a pound in New York, after earlier
reaching $2.6675, the highest for a most-active contract since
June 1997.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for May delivery advanced
$12, or 0.5 percent, to $2,295 a ton.  Cocoa futures for May delivery fell $26, or 0.8 percent, to
$3,380 a ton in New York. Yesterday the price reached $3,444,
the highest since Jan. 21, 2010.  In  London , cocoa for March delivery declined 31 pounds, or
1.4 percent, to close at 2,208 pounds ($3,563) a ton, falling
for the first time in six sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
