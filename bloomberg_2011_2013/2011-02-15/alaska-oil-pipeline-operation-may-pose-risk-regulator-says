The Trans  Alaska  Pipeline System may
pose risks to public safety and environment, because a reduced
volume of crude exposes the pipe to corrosion, a U.S. regulator
said in ordering repairs.  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,
part of the Transportation Department, ordered Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co., owner of the network, to take action such as
replacing pipe, according to a  letter  dated Feb. 1.  “The continued operation of the affected pipeline without
corrective measures would pose a pipeline integrity risk,” the
agency said in the letter.  The regulator is investigating the pipeline after a Jan. 8
leak. The oil flowing through the pipe has declined at an
average rate of 6 percent a year to about 650,000 barrels a day
in 2010, according to the letter.  The 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) system, linking  Prudhoe Bay 
on Alaska’s Arctic Ocean coast with the port of Valdez in the
south, began operations in 1977, and carries about 11 percent of
U.S. crude.  “We’re in the process of drafting our response,” Matt Carle, an Alyeska spokesman, said by phone from Anchorage today.  Julia Valentine, a spokeswoman for the agency, didn’t
immediately return phone calls and e-mails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
