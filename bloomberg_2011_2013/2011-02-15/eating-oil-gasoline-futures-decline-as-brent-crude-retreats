Gasoline and heating oil dropped in  New York , following the lead of Brent crude oil in  London  for a
second day as the oil contract declined.  Futures lost as Brent for April delivery fell $1.44 to
settle at $101.64 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange on
speculation it has become overpriced on concern over spreading
political tension in the Middle East. Refineries supplying fuel
to New York Harbor, the delivery point for heating oil and
gasoline futures, use crude oil grades priced relative to Brent.  Traders “view imports to the U.S. of gasoline and exports
of distillate as tied to the European market,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for March delivery dropped 2.86 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $2.4888 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Gasoline rose 2.1 percent yesterday after
Brent increased to $103.08, the highest settlement since
September 2008. Prices have gained 1.5 percent this year.  Heating oil for March delivery declined 2.14 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.729 a gallon, after rising 2 percent
yesterday. The front-month contract is up 7.3 percent this year.  Protests against Bahrain’s government escalated as a second
demonstrator was killed and in Yemen anti-government marchers
clashed with police. Algeria shares many of the same social and
political maladies that led to the ouster of Egypt’s government,
said Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive officer at Pacific
Investment Management Co. Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak 
resigned Feb. 11.  Products ‘Overbought’  “Refinery products are pretty overbought and Brent is
ridiculously overpriced, but there’s still a high level of
concern about events going on in the Middle East,” said  Peter Beutel , president of trading advisory company Cameron Hanover
Inc. in  New Canaan , Connecticut.  Nymex-traded West Texas Intermediate crude oil for March
delivery dropped a third consecutive day, losing 49 cents to
settle at $84.32 in New York, the lowest level since Nov. 30.  Supplies of gasoline probably rose 1.85 million barrels
last week, according to the median estimate of 14 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg News.  Stockpiles of gasoline added 4.66 million barrels to 240.9
million barrels in the week ended Feb. 4, the largest total
since March 1990. Demand, measured by deliveries to wholesalers,
sank to the lowest level since the week ended Feb. 12, 2010.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington . The industry-
funded  American Petroleum Institute  will release its supply data
after the close of floor trading today.  Distillate Inventory  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
probably declined 400,000 barrels, according to the survey. They
rose 288,000 barrels to 164.4 million in the week ended Feb. 4,
according to the department. Demand dropped to a three-week low.  Normal to higher-than-normal temperatures are projected for
much of the eastern U.S. Feb. 20 through Feb. 28, according to
the National Weather Service’s  Climate Prediction Center .  “Supplies in the U.S. are ample and heating oil is
pressured by the fact we’re having this huge warm-up,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, dropped
0.2 cent to $3.124 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
