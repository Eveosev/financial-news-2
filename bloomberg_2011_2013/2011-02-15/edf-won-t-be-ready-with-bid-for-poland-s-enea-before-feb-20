Electricite de France SA, the
European Union’s biggest power producer, won’t be ready by Feb.
20 to place a final bid for  Poland ’s third-largest utility  Enea
SA , valued at $3.36 billion on the Warsaw bourse today.  “We are doing due diligence and we will have a bit of a
delay on the date,” EDF Chief Executive Officer  Henri Proglio 
said at a press conference in Paris today. Warsaw-based Dziennik
Gazeta Prawna  said today  EDF will place the bid by Feb. 20.  Poland picked EDF for exclusive talks to buy a 51 percent
stake in Enea in December and the Treasury Ministry plans to
close the Enea deal by the end of this quarter. The Ministry’s
holding was valued at 4.98 billion zloty at 2:40 p.m. in Warsaw
trading today. The transaction will probably be at least twice
as large after the Ministry said in October it wants a potential
buyer to announce a bid for all of the utility.  EDF wants to strengthen its business in central  Europe ,
Proglio said today.  “We are interested in all the countries of central
Europe,” he said. “It’s an important zone in terms of energy
needs and a zone of strong growth.”  Poland’s Economy Ministry  forecasts  demand for electricity
will rise to 217 terawatt-hours by 2030 as the country catches
up with consumption in western Europe. Last year  consumption
increased  4.2 percent to 155 terawatt-hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
