California Governor  Jerry Brown 
ordered a hiring freeze for the state’s government to help
reduce a $25 billion deficit.  The decision applies to vacant, seasonal, and full and
part-time positions, according to an e-mailed statement released
by his office today.  “We have a $25 billion deficit, and we must do everything
possible to save money and make government leaner and more
efficient,” Brown, 72, a Democrat, said in the statement.  Brown, who became governor last month, has pledged to trim
the size of California’s government to balance the budget of the
most populous and most indebted U.S. state. He proposed an $84.6
billion budget plan last month that relies on a combination of
taxes and spending cuts.  Brown last month ordered state workers to hand in half the
96,000 government-paid mobile phones and said he wants to trim  California ’s fleet of 13,600 vehicles.  The hiring freeze is part of an effort to cut $363 million
in operational costs next fiscal year, according to the
statement.  “The hiring freeze will be in effect until agencies and
departments prove that they can achieve these savings,” Brown
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
