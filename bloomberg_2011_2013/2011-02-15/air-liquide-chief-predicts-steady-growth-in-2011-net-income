  Air Liquide SA , the world’s biggest
producer of industrial gases, forecast “steady growth” in net
income this year after reporting full-year earnings in line with
analysts’ estimates.  Net income climbed 14 percent to 1.4 billion euros ($1.89
billion) in 2010 from 1.23 billion euros, the Paris-based
company said today in a statement. The average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts was 1.38 billion euros.  “Assuming normal conditions, Air Liquide is confident in
its ability to generate steady growth of net profit in 2011,”
Chief Executive Officer Benoit Potier said in the statement.  Potier said in December that annual sales may rise by 8
percent to 10 percent on average through 2015 as the company
boosts investments in  China ,  Russia , the Middle East and other
fast-growing regions. The company aims to meet rising demand for
oxygen, hydrogen and other gases used by the oil-and-gas
industry and makers of steel, cars, flat and solar panels, as
well as hospitals and the home-care industry.  The company may invest 1.8 billion euros to 2 billion euros
in 2011, Chief Financial Officer Fabienne Lecorvaisier told
journalists in Paris today. In 2010, capital expenditure net of
asset sales amounted to 1.7 billion euros, according to today’s
statement.  Fourth-quarter sales rose 9.2 percent, excluding changes in
exchange rates and natural gas prices, the CFO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
