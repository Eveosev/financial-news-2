  Immofinanz AG ,  Austria ’s biggest
property developer, is offering as much as 550 million euros
($744 million) of convertible bonds to fund a partial buyback of
two outstanding securities.  The new notes due March 2018 will be convertible into as
many as 125 million shares, the Vienna-based company said in a
statement yesterday. The funds will be used to redeem
outstanding convertible bonds due 2014 and 2017, which can be
called by next year.  Chief Executive Officer Eduard Zehetner said today the
conversion price may be 30 percent to 40 percent above the
current share price and the coupon may be more than 3 percent.  Immofinanz shareholders will have the first right to
subscribe to the bonds. For every 23 shares they own, they can
buy three bonds convertible into one share each. The
subscription period starts tomorrow and is scheduled to end
March 2. Institutional investors will be offered bonds that
aren’t taken up.  A successful refinancing will complete Immofinanz’s
restructuring following a cash squeeze in 2009. Zehetner has
merged eastern European unit Immoeast AG, put expansion plans on
hold, settled disputes with former affiliates and sold assets to
restore cash reserves. Dividend payments, suspended since 2008,
will be resumed if the refinancing succeeds, and may be 10 cents
a share for 2011, Zehetner said.  The company will also increase investments in eastern  Europe  to 500 million euros to 600 million euros a year,
financed mainly through asset sales of around 500 million euros
a year, Zehetner said.  Strike Price  Immofinanz shares closed little changed at 3.266 euros in
Vienna trading. The company will mainly use treasury shares if
the bond is converted, avoiding a dilution of common shares. A
maximum of 21 million shares, or 2 percent of the outstanding
stock, could be issued if all bonds are converted.  The 2014 and the 2017 convertibles have strike prices of
14.68 euros and 9.26 euros, respectively. That makes it likely
that investors would demand early redemption when they get the
option next year. A third outstanding bond that matures next
year has a strike price of 2 euros.  Immofinanz is offering to pay 99.75 percent of face value
for each 2014 bond and 106 percent of face value for each 2017
bond, according to the statement. The buyback is limited by the
amount raised in the new issue, Immofinanz said. The bonds
reached their lowest point on Nov. 13, 2008, when both traded at
6.6 percent of face value at the height of a liquidity crisis.  Credit Suisse Group AG,  Deutsche Bank AG  and UniCredit Bank
Austria AG are helping manage the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
