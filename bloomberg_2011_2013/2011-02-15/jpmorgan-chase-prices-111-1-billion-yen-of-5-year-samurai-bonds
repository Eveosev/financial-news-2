  JPMorgan Chase & Co . set a coupon of
1.05 percent on a sale of 76.9 billion yen of five-year, fixed-
rate Samurai bonds.  The New York-based bank will also sell 34.2 billion yen of
floating-rate Samurai bonds of the same maturity with a coupon
40 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate for yen. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The terms of the sale were disclosed by a person with
direct knowledge of the transaction who declined to be
identified before an official announcement.  Samurai bonds are yen-denominated debt sold in Japan by
overseas borrowers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
