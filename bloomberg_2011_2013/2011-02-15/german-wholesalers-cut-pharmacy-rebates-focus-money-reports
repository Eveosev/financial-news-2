German drug wholesalers are cutting
pharmacy rebates because of a new law to control the cost of
innovative medicines,  Focus-Money  magazine said, citing Markus
Reitz, head of the pharmacists’ union of the Bonn-Rhein-Sieg
region.  Cuts of up to 1.5 percentage points have been announced,
the magazine said. If the wholesalers, which include  Celesio AG ,
succeed in cutting rebates, it would mean the pharmacies would
shoulder 400 million euros ($539 million), or 10 percent, of the
law’s planned savings, instead of a projected 200 million euros,
the magazine said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
