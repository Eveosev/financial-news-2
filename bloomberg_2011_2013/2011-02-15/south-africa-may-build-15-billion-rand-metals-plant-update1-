  South Africa  is considering building
an integrated metal-processing factory that would require an
investment of 15 billion rand ($2.05 billion) and have the
potential to create 7,000 jobs, Economic Development Minister  Ebrahim Patel  said.  The plant would be capable of processing titanium,
zirconium, vanadium, magnesium and silicone, he said in a speech
to Parliament in Cape Town today. A study into the feasibility
of the project is under way, he said.  Patel, a former labor-union leader, is the driving force
behind a new government growth plan that aims to create 5
million jobs by 2020 and cut the  unemployment rate  to about 15
percent from 24 percent.  “We have compiled a database of potential projects in
green energy, manufacturing, waste-management, eco-tourism,
agriculture and mining,” Patel said. “To address funding
challenges in a new sector, the Industrial Development Corp. has
committed to allocate 25 billion rand to new investments in the
green economy over the next five years.”  On Sept. 2, Patel said the IDC, a state-owned lender, would
invest 11.7 billion rand in clean-energy projects over the next
“few” years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
