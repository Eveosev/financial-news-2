  Danone , the world’s biggest yogurt
maker, forecast improved profitability in 2011 as emerging-
market sales and cost reductions offset higher commodity prices.  The operating margin will widen 0.2 percentage point,
excluding certain items, with all of the improvement likely to
occur in the second half, the maker of Bledina baby foods said
today. Danone also said sales excluding acquisitions and
currency shifts will rise 6 percent to 8 percent this year.  “We enter 2011 with confidence,” Chief Financial Officer
Pierre-Andre Terisse said on a call with reporters after the
company reported an 18 percent increase in 2010 earnings and
fourth-quarter sales growth that beat analysts’ estimates.  Danone rose as much as 4 percent in Paris trading, the most
since Oct. 21. The Activia maker said it now gets about half its
sales from emerging markets after buying a stake in a Russian
business last year, forming the biggest dairy company in that
country. Expenses for raw materials and packaging will rise 6
percent to 9 percent on average this year, Danone also forecast.  “The margin improvement targeted for 2011 is very
reassuring,” wrote Pierre Tegner, an analyst at Oddo in Paris
with a “buy” recommendation on the shares, adding that the
sales target is higher than analysts’ forecasts.  Full-year profit from continuing businesses and excluding
one-time items rose to 1.67 billion euros ($2.3 billion), Danone
said. The median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
was for profit of 1.66 billion euros.  So-called organic sales, which exclude acquisitions and
currency swings, increased 6.9 percent.  Emerging Markets  Fourth-quarter sales rose to 4.3 billion euros from 3.68
billion euros, Danone said, beating the 4.13 billion-euro
average estimate of 32 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Danone plans to expand in emerging markets such as China,  India ,  Indonesia  and  Mexico  as well as the U.S., Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Franck Riboud said at a meeting with
analysts. He said U.S. expansion won’t be through the
acquisition of a “huge” company. Danone is open to form
alliances to expand its water business, Riboud also said.  Asian sales rose 27 percent in 2010, compared with a 5.5
percent gain in  Europe , Danone said. Total revenue increased 14
percent to 17 billion euros.  The shares rose as much as 1.74 euros, or 4 percent, to
45.69 euros in Paris trading. They were at 45.45 euros at 10:40
a.m., giving Danone a market value of about 29 billion euros.  The company also said today it will buy back as much as 500
million euros of stock in the first half after it completes an
existing 500 million-euro share repurchase program.  Danone sold its stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann Dairy & Juice Co.
for $470 million in October. PepsiCo Inc. agreed two months
later to buy a majority stake in the beverage maker for $3.8
billion. Danone also agreed in July to sell its stake in  China 
Huiyuan Juice Group Limited for about 200 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
