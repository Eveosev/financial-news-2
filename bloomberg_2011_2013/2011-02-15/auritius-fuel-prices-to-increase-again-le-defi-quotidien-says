Retail fuel prices in Mauritius are
set to increase for the second time in three weeks, Le Defi
Quotidien reported, citing unidentified officials.  The Petroleum Pricing Committee is due to meet tonight to
determine the size of the increase, which was made necessary by
rising global prices, the  Port-Louis  based newspaper said.  The price of gasoline rose to 48.50 rupees per liter from
44.70 rupees between Oct. 5 and Jan. 21, the State Trading
Corporation said on that date. Diesel prices increased to 39.90
rupees from 35.50 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
