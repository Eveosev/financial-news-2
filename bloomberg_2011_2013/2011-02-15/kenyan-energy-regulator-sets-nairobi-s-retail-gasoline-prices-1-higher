  Kenya â€™s Energy Regulatory Commission
set maximum retail prices for regular gasoline at 98.11
shillings ($1.21) a liter in the capital, Nairobi, up 1 percent
from a month earlier.  The price cap is effective until March 14, the regulator
said in its monthly review of fuel costs published in a
statement on its website yesterday. Nairobi accounts for as much
as 55 percent of total fuel consumption in the East African
country, according to a commission spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
