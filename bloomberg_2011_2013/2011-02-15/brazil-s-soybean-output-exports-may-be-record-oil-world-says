  Brazil ’s soybean production and
exports may climb to records this year as rainfall in Mato
Grosso, Parana and Minas Gerais boosts crop prospects and plants
develop faster than normal, Oil World said.  Brazil’s soybean crop may be 71 million metric tons, up
from last year’s record of 68.7 million tons, and exports may
rise 13 percent to an all-time high of 33 million tons, Oil
World said in a report today. Normal or above-normal rainfall
the past six weeks has improved conditions, the company said.  About 44 percent of soybeans in Mato Grosso do Sul was in
the pod-filling stage, up from 37 percent at the same time a
year ago, Oil World said. Growers will harvest 24.1 million
hectares (59.6 million acres), up from 23.5 million hectares a
year earlier, Oil World said. Yields will total 2.93 tons a
hectare, unchanged from a year earlier, according to the report.  “The Brazilian soybean crop is in excellent shape almost
everywhere and initial harvesting resulted in very high
yields,” Oil World said. “Crop development has been
very good in the past few weeks almost everywhere.”  Brazil’s exportable supplies will be larger in calendar
year 2011 than expected, according to the report. Exports will
jump as high as 33 million tons, up from 29.1 million a year
ago, while crushing will remain steady at 36 million tons, Oil
World said. Domestic soy meal consumption will rise along with
expanding poultry and pork industries, according to Oil World.  Oilseeds Planting  Area planted with oilseeds and grains in Brazil increased
to a record 44.9 million hectares, Oil World said. The amount of
land planted with oilseeds surged while area seeded with corn
declined. Cotton area also increased, reaching an 18-year high
of 1.3 million hectares, up from 840,000 hectares a year
earlier, according to the report.    Argentina ’s biodiesel production increased to 550,000
million tons in October through December, up from 490,000
million in the preceding quarter, Oil World said. Rising exports
and increased domestic consumption boosted demand, spurring
growers to plant more, the company said. Production in Brazil
increased by 46 percent to 2.06 million tons in 2010, Oil World
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
