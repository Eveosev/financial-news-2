  Yell Group Plc , the publisher of the
U.K.’s yellow pages, fell to the lowest in London trading since
listing in July 2003 after saying full-year earnings will be
“slightly below” the range of analysts’ estimates.  The shares fell as much as 8.2 percent and were down 0.54
pence, or 5.5 percent, to 9.37 pence at 11 a.m., extending the
company’s share price decline over the past year to 75 percent
and cutting its market value to 222 million pounds ($356
million).  Yell’s printed directory business is declining as customers
switch to digital media. Chief Executive Officer Mike Pocock,
who took over on Jan. 1, is drawing up a new strategy focusing
more on the Internet, social networks and e-commerce. Pocock
plans to unveil the strategy in the second half of June.  “We are quite excited about the prospects,” Pocock said
in a telephone interview today. “We are going to bring it
together as a single group and focus on the global marketplace.
We will have tremendous efficiency gains.”  Yell operates in the U.S., Spain and Latin America as well
as the U.K.  Fiscal third-quarter net income slumped 93 percent to 1.6
million pounds, or 0.1 pence a share, from 21.8 million pounds,
or 1.1 pence, a year ago, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Revenue from its print business for the nine months ended
Dec. 31 fell 18 percent to 936.6 million pounds, Yell said in a
statement today. Digital media revenue rose 10 percent on a
constant currency basis to 342.2 million pounds and accounts for
25 percent of group revenue.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization for the year ending March 31 is now expected to be
“slightly below” analysts’ estimates, Yell said. Ebitda will
be 533 million pounds for the year, according to the median
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Yell aims to get more revenue from digital sales than print
sales as quickly as it can, Pocock said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
