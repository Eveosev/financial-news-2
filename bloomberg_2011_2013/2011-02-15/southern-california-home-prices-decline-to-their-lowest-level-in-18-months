Southern California home prices last
month fell to the lowest level since 2009 and sales dropped 5.9
percent as high unemployment and tight credit curtailed demand,
according to  MDA DataQuick .  The median price paid in January for houses and
condominiums in  Los Angeles , Riverside, Ventura,  San Diego , San
Bernardino and Orange counties was $270,000, down from $271,500
a year earlier and the lowest level since July 2009, when it was
$268,000. The median fell 6.9 percent from December, the San
Diego-based data company said today in a statement.  “Lots of potential buyers continue to hold back, waiting
for a sign prices have bottomed, that their jobs are safe, or
that loans are easier to get,”  John Walsh , MDA DataQuick’s
president, said in the statement. “Sales were lousy, but many
investors and others looking for bargains stayed active.”  Sales in the region totaled 14,458 homes, down 5.9 percent
from a year earlier and 26 percent from December. It was the
lowest January tally in three years and the second-lowest since
1996, MDA DataQuick said.  About 30 percent of buyers appeared to pay all cash, an
almost record proportion. Buyers in transactions where there was
no corresponding loan paid a median $190,000, said the data
provider, a unit of Richmond, British Columbia-based MacDonald,
Dettwiler & Associates Ltd. The company compiles county records
and supplies real estate data to public agencies, lenders and
title companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
