Fans at  U.S. PGA Tour  events will be
allowed to carry mobile devices and use them in select areas
during tournaments, beginning at next month’s  Honda Classic .  The world’s top professional golf circuit tested the use of
mobile devices by fans at five events late in the 2010 season
and early this year to determine the impact phones and other
hand-held equipment might have on the competition.  Under the new policy, fans will be allowed to carry such
devices on the course with the volume set to silent. Phone calls
can be made or received in designated areas throughout the
course, such as concession stands, according to a Tour  statement .  “We understand that mobile devices are an important part
of everyday life.” said Andy Pazder, the Tour’s chief of
operations. “We anticipate our fans will be respectful of the
policy and as a result the integrity of our competitions will
not be compromised.”  Fans can receive and send data messages while on the course,
provided it’s done away from the playing area. No video
recording will be permitted at any time, and photography won’t
be allowed during official rounds.  The policy will be implemented on a tournament-by-
tournament basis. The Masters Tournament,  U.S. Open ,  British
Open  and  PGA Championship  -- golf’s four major tournaments --are
run by bodies other than the PGA Tour and will have their own
policies. Currently, mobile devices aren’t permitted during the
majors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
