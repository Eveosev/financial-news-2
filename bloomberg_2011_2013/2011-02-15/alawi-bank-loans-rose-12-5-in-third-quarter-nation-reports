Bank lending in Malawi rose 12.5
percent to 222.9 million kwacha ($1.4 billion) in the third
quarter from the previous three months, the Nation said today,
citing  Reserve Bank  of Malawi.  The growth in loans came after the central bank cut its key
interest rate to 13 percent from 15 percent on Aug. 1, the
Blantyre-based newspaper said.  Calls to the central bank for comment were not answered
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
