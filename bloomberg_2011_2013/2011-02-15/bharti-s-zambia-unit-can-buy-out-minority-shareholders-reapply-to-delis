  Bharti Airtel Ltd . said it will
reapply to delist its Zambian unit from the country’s bourse
after the regulator said it can buy out minority shareholders.  The company was working with the Zambian Securities and
Exchange Commission and other authorities to get permission from
the Lusaka Stock Exchange to delist, the New Delhi-based group
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Bharti has the right to buy out the remaining 3 percent of
shareholders who have refused to sell their stakes, Michael
Liwelela, director of the country’s Securities and Exchange
Commission, said by phone today from the capital, Lusaka. “We
are confident that the matter will be resolved satisfactorily,”
Bharti said.  About 2,000 shareholders, owning 3 percent of Celtel Zambia
Ltd., turned down an offer of 710 kwacha a share ($0.15) from
Bharti Airtel, Beatrice Nkanza, chief executive officer of the
exchange, said on Dec. 30. Bharti announced on Dec. 24 it
planned to delist from the exchange after increasing its stake
to 97 percent from 78.9 percent. Trading of the shares was
suspended on Aug. 18 after Bharti bought Zain’s African assets.  “If the minority shareholders are not happy they can
challenge the decision in court,” Liwelela said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
