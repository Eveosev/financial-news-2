Eastern members of the European
Union are “deeply” concerned about the increase in food and
commodity prices and urge the 27-nation bloc to seek a common
method to tackle it, Slovak Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova  said.  The global increase is driven by speculation and individual
countries aren’t able to influence it, Radicova said after
meeting with her Czech, Polish and Hungarian counterparts in the
Slovak capital, Bratislava. The prime ministers of the four
countries are asking the EU to deal with the issue as early as
its March summit, she said.  Price growth has been accelerating across  Europe , driven by
energy and food costs, raising concern the fragile economic
recovery may be damaged should monetary authorities respond by
raising  interest rates . Euro-area inflation, at a preliminary
2.4 percent in January, is already in breach of the  European
Central Bank ’s 2 percent target. Poland said today that the
country’s annual inflation rate reached 3.8 percent in January,
a 21-month high.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI index, used as a benchmark of
movements in commodity prices, has gained almost 22 percent in
the past six months to 4993.8 today. The monthly compiled United
Nations Food and Agriculture World Price Index reached a record
230.8 as of Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
