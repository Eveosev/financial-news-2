  Absa Group Ltd ., the South African
bank controlled by  Barclays Plc , said profit rose 19 percent as
the number of bad loans declined after the central bank dropped
its key interest rate to a 30-year low.  Net income climbed to 8.12 billion rand ($1.1 billion) from
6.84 billion rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based lender
said in a statement today. Earnings per share excluding one-time
items rose to 11.15 rand from 10.72 rand a year ago, Absa said,
beating the 11.13 rand median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Absa, the first of  South Africa ’s four largest banks to
release full-year earnings for 2010, is the country’s biggest
retail lender with more than 11 million customers. Consumers
have started to repay debts, helped by the central bank having
narrowed its benchmark interest rate three times last year, and
a recovery in  Africa ’s largest economy from a 2009 recession.  Absa is the worst-performing banking stock on the six-
member FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index this year, having dropped 6.3
percent to 131.25 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
