Valuations for U.S. technology
stocks have fallen as a gauge of industry growth surges to the
highest levels since the dot-com bubble, a sign the current
expansion may be sustainable.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the San Francisco Federal
Reserve’s Tech Pulse Index, which measures employment,
investment, production, shipments and consumption, climbed to
114.82 in January, the highest since 2001. Technology stocks in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index trade for 17 times reported
earnings, compared with the peak of 76.9 in March 2000.  “After a big downturn in the industry post-2000, the
sector has regained its footing and is recovering at a healthy
pace,” Myles Zyblock, Royal Bank of Canada’s Toronto-based
chief institutional strategist, said in a telephone interview.
“Interestingly, with all the strong activity and earnings,
prices are nowhere near the level they were at that time.”  S&P 500 technology companies have the highest cash-to-asset
ratio of the 10 industries in the index, Zyblock wrote in a Feb.
2 report. Cash accounts for 14 percent of assets in the
industry, more than double the proportion in the benchmark U.S.
equity index, he said.  Technology companies have been using the cash to repurchase
shares, accounting for about 29 percent of the S&P 500’s total
buybacks in the third quarter, Zyblock said. The group has also
been increasing dividend issuance faster than other industries
in the benchmark index, he wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
