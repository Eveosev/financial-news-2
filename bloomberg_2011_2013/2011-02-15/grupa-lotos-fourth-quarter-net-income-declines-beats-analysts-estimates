  Grupa Lotos SA , Poland’s second-
largest oil refiner, said fourth-quarter profit fell 1.8 percent
as non-cash gains on oil inventories offset losses on extraction
and retailing.  Net income declined to 223.1 million zloty ($76 million),
the Gdansk-based company said in a regulatory statement today.
The details “might not be so encouraging,” Tamas Pletser, an
analyst at ING Groep NV in Budapest, wrote in a note.  Earnings before interest and taxes using the last-in first-
out accounting method, or LIFO, which strips out the effect of
rising oil prices on valuation of reserves, fell to 52.1 million
zloty from 324.3 million zloty in the third quarter, which was
the highest figure since at least the first quarter of 2008.  The LIFO figures “cool down the optimism” about Lotos’s
2011 earnings, which had increased after the third-quarter LIFO
Ebit, Kamil Kliszcz, an analyst at BRE Bank SA in Warsaw, said
by phone.  Lotos, which  Poland ’s government plans to sell as early as
2012, has gained 27 percent since those earnings were announced
Nov. 4, and were up 0.3 percent at 11:53 a.m. in Warsaw today.
The benchmark WIG20 Index rose less than 0.1 percent.  The refiner posted an operating loss of 55.1 million zloty
on extraction operations, after a 48.3 million write-off for two
Baltic Sea wells. It also had a 3.8 million-zloty loss from
sales at its gas stations.  ‘Poor’ Figures  The quality of the figures is “poor,” Monika Kalwasinska,
an analyst at PKO Bank Polski SA, wrote in a note today. “The
extraction and retail segments are a negative surprise.”  Ebit from refining and wholesale rose to 263.6 million
zloty from 90.1 million zloty a year earlier. The profit was
boosted by rising crude prices, which increased the value of oil
in Lotos’s tanks and added 177.7 million zloty to Ebit.  The increase was also helped by rising sales, which
advanced 43 percent to 5.74 billion zloty as volume rose
following a refinery upgrade.  Lotos in 2010 started using new capacity at its Gdansk
refinery and is set to complete this year a 5.6 billion-zloty
investment that will boost maximum throughput by 75 percent to
10.5 million tons a year.  PKN Orlen SA is Poland’s biggest oil refiner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
