INA Industrija Nafte d.d.,  Croatia ’s
largest refiner, had its first full-year profit since 2007 as
increased production in the northern Adriatic and Syria pushed
up revenue.  Net income reached 958 million kuna ($174 million) compared
with a loss of 392 million kuna in 2009, the Zagreb-based
company controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt. said today in a
statement. Revenue increased 15.8 percent to 25.8 billion kuna,
up from 22.3 billion kuna in 2009.  INA is the fourth biggest employer and one of the biggest
investors in Croatia, having spent about 17 billion kuna in the
last decade to expand its operations. INA will continue to
modernize its facilities and “revitalize” its retail network
this year as it plans for expansion, company officials said
today.  “We have secured for some years financial reserves for the
company and we are going to complete very significant
investments,”  INA  Chief Executive Officer Zoltan Aldott said at
a press conference in Zagreb.  Investments  In addition to 11 exploration and production plants in
continental Croatia and 19 off-shore platforms in the northern
Adriatic that are jointly owned with  Italy ’s ENI SpA and Edison
SpA, INA has upstream facilities in Syria, Egypt and  Angola .  Mol holds a 47.15 percent stake in INA, while the Croatian
government owns 44.84 percent. INA rose 0.1% to 3,650 kuna per
share as of 2:18 p.m. in Zagreb after the results were
announced.  Aldott said INA is still in talks with the government about
the future of its gas unit, Prirodni plin d.d, which in 2010 had
a “negative impact” on the company’s profit.  The government was obliged to take over by December the
trading business of Prirodni plin. The price of gas is regulated
by the government, and private customers pay less per cubic
meter than the cost of imported gas, making it a money-losing
business.  The company said on Dec. 22 its production of gas and
liquid petroleum gas in Hayan,  Syria , will “significantly
rise” this year and reach maximum capacity in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
