  Chevron Corp . said it shut pipelines
at its  Henry Hub  gas separation station in Texas as a precaution
during a grass fire in the area.  Gas interconnects were “down for just a little while” and
restarted after the fire was out, Mickey Driver, a spokesman for
the company, said in an e-mail. The cause of the blaze is under
investigation.  “The fire did not impact or threaten any CPL equipment and
was extinguished by the Henry Volunteer Fire Department” at
4:30 p.m. local time yesterday, Driver said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
