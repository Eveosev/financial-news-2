  Apple Inc ., whose supplier Foxconn
Technology Group was hit by a series of employee suicides last
year, said a quick response by the Taiwanese assembler helped
prevent further deaths.  Apple commissioned a review by a team of suicide-prevention
experts after the worker deaths, and in August presented its
findings to senior executives from both companies, including
Foxconn founder and Chairman Terry Gou, according to Apple’s
annual Supplier Responsibility report.  “The team commended Foxconn for taking quick action,”
Apple  wrote . “Foxconn had worked openly with many outside
experts and government officials in reacting to the crisis. Most
important, the investigation found that Foxconn’s response had
definitely saved lives.”  Foxconn, which makes Apple’s iPad and also supplies  Hewlett-Packard Co ., Sony Corp., and Dell Inc., installed nets
to deter people from jumping, opened a 24-hour counseling
hotline and hired psychologists after at least 10 China workers
committed suicide. Apple Chief Executive Officer  Steve Jobs  on
June 2 denied Foxconn was a sweatshop, saying his company was
“all over” the supplier to deal with the deaths.  Foxconn, whose flagship Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. is
based in Taipei, is the world’s largest contract manufacturer of
electronics, with more than 1 million workers.  Apple said it audited 127 of its suppliers’ facilities last
year to check compliance with its supplier code of conduct,
which includes labor and human rights, health and safety, ethics
and environmental impact.  To contact the reporter on this story:
