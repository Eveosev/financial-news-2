  Capella Education Co ., a for-profit
online-education company, fell as much as 15 percent in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading after forecasting a 35 percent decline in
new enrollments for the current quarter.  Capella also said it will fire 125 non-faculty employees,
or 8 percent of its workforce, to save as much as $13 million a
year. The job cuts will result in a $2 million charge in the
first quarter, the Minneapolis-based education company said in a
statement today.  For-profit university revenue is being threatened by
proposed regulations from the  U.S. Department of Education  that
are slowing the growth of enrollments. Capella said total
enrollments for the first quarter will grow 4.5 percent to 6.5
percent, less than the 7 percent estimate of Jeff Silber, an
analyst with BMO Capital Markets Corp. in  New York , who rates
the shares “market perform.”  “We are now operating in an uncertain environment,” Kevin Gilligan, chairman and chief executive officer of Capella, said
in the statement. “The current uncertainty is driven by weaker
demand for higher education, regulatory uncertainty and
increased competition.”  Capella fell $9.11, or 14 percent, to $54.23 at 11:02 a.m.
in New York, after dropping to as low as $54. The shares have
fallen 24 percent in the past 12 months.  Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 grew 20
percent to $18 million, or $1.09 a share, Capella said in the
statement. Revenue rose 21 percent to $114.7 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
