Billionaire John Paulson added to
the health-care and energy holdings of his hedge fund in the
fourth quarter, acquiring stakes in companies such as  Medtronic
Inc . and Transocean Ltd.  Paulson & Co., the New York based money-management firm,
reported in a Form 13F filed today that it bought new stakes in
three medical device and pharmaceutical companies during the
period. The holdings, which had a total value of $824 million as
of Dec. 31, included shares in Medtronic Inc.,  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd . and Baxter International Inc.  Medtronic is a Minneapolis-based manufacturer of pacemakers
and defibrillators, while Teva, with headquarters in Petah
Tikva, Israel, is the world’s largest maker of generic drugs.
Baxter, in Deerfield, Illinois, makes products for people with
hemophilia, immune disorders, kidney disease and other medical
conditions.  In the energy sector, Paulson reported buying 7.2 million
Transocean shares with a market value of $500 million as of Dec.
31. Transocean, the world’s largest offshore driller, owned the
Deepwater rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in April.  The hedge fund acquired a $128 million stake in  Walter
Energy Inc ., a Tampa-based coal-mining company, during the
quarter, according to today’s filing. Paulson raised its holding
in The Woodlands, Texas-based  Anadarko Petroleum Corp . to 21.3
million shares from 13.4 million shares as of Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
