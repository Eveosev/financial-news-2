Kuwait is planning a full shutdown
of its Shuaiba refinery for 45 days starting April 3, said
Mohammed Al-Ajmi, a spokesman for the state-run refinery
operator  Kuwait  National Petroleum Co.  The closure will be for scheduled maintenance, Al-Ajmi said
by phone from Ahmadi, Kuwait, adding that the company conducts
the so-called general refinery turnaround every five years.
Shuaiba is the oldest and smallest of Kuwait’s three plants with
a 200,000 barrel-a-day processing capacity.  Middle Eastern oil producers such as Kuwait import refined
products including diesel and gasoline as they lack the domestic
capacity to process enough crude to meet local fuel demand.  Kuwait, the fifth-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, put on hold a plan for what would
be the Persian Gulf country’s fourth refinery in March 2009
after political opposition forced the government to cancel
letters of intent.  The country’s three refineries have a capacity to process
931,000 barrels a day of crude, according to data from BP Plc’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
