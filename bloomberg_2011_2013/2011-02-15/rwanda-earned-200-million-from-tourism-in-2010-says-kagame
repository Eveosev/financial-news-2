  Rwanda  earned $200 million from its
tourism industry last year, with 666,000 tourists visiting the
East African country, President  Paul Kagame  told parliament in
his State-of-the-Nation speech yesterday.  “We have adopted strategies to protect our environment,
natural resources and tourist attraction sites, which have led
to an ever growing number of tourists visiting Rwanda,” Kagame
said, according to an e-mailed copy of the speech from the
president’s office.  Revenue from tourism represented a 14 percent increase from
the year before, according to the Rwanda Development Board. The
country’s main tourist attraction is mountain gorillas, which
are found in the  Volcanoes National Park , the Virunga Park in
the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Mgahinga and Bwindi
parks in  Uganda .  The world’s gorilla population, including those in
captivity, is 786, the development board said in a statement on
Dec. 7.  Rwanda’s economy grew 7.4 percent last year on the back of
an 8.1 percent expansion in service industries, Finance Minister
John Rwangombwa said on Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
