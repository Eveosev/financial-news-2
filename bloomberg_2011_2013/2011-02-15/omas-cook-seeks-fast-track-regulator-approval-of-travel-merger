  Thomas Cook Group Plc , Europe’s
second-biggest tour operator, asked a U.K. antitrust regulator
to “fast-track” an investigation of its planned joint venture
with the Co-operative Group Ltd. and Midlands Co-operative.  The companies asked the  Office of Fair Trading  to
immediately refer the proposed deal to Britain’s  Competition
Commission  instead of waiting as long as three weeks to make a
decision, according to a statement today from  Thomas Cook . They
plan to join their travel and foreign-exchange operations.  “We continue to believe that there is compelling rationale
for clearance,” Manny Fontenla-Novoa, chief executive officer
of London-based Thomas Cook, said in the statement. “We feel
that proceeding straight to the Competition Commission should
provide us with the right answer most quickly.”  The European Commission in January granted the OFT
permission to review the merger after the U.K. regulator
requested jurisdiction over the deal, saying the joint venture
would “significantly” threaten competition in travel services.
If the  Competition Commission  takes over the probe, it would
have six months to approve or reject the deal.  Thomas Cook said when it announced the deal on Oct. 8 that
the combined businesses would create the U.K.’s largest travel
retailer and the second-biggest foreign-exchange provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
