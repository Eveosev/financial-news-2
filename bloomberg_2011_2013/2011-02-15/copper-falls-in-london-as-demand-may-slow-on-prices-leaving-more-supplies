Copper fell the most in three weeks
on speculation that record prices will slow demand, resulting in
increased stockpiles.  Inventories in warehouses monitored by the  London  Metal
Exchange are up 6.6 percent this year. Supplies in Shanghai were
at the highest level since June, figures showed last week.  “Stockpiles are bound to jump at these prices,” said  David Thurtell , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London.  Copper futures for May delivery fell 9.15 cents, or 2
percent, to close at $4.546 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the Comex in
New York, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since
Jan. 25. Earlier, the price reached $4.6575, the highest ever.  Some base metals such as copper “are close to their
cyclical peaks and positioning is generally long and stretched,
making them particularly vulnerable,” Citigroup analysts
including Thurtell said today in a report.    Hedge funds  and money managers boosted their bullish bets
on copper by 14 percent in the week ended Feb. 8, the most in
two months, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
showed last week. Net-long positions were at 36,590 contracts,
just 2,515 contracts below the record level at the end of last
year.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery dropped $149, or 1.5 percent, to $10,011 a metric ton
($4.52 a pound). Earlier, the metal touched a record $10,190.  As much as 1 million tons of unreported refined-copper
stockpiles in  China  could re-enter the market at “handsome”
price levels of above $10,000,  Nick Moore  and Daniel Major,
London-based analysts at RBS Global Banking and Markets, said in
a report on Feb. 11.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the LME rose by 650 tons, or
0.2 percent, to 402,425 tons, daily exchange figures show.
Inventories are at the highest level since Aug. 25.  Aluminum, nickel, zinc and lead all fell in London. Tin
rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
