The Greek government asked for bids
for a contract to create digital services aimed at improving
passenger services on public transit, according to an e-mailed
statement from  Greece â€™s  Ministry of Regional Development and
Competition.   The project, worth 60 million euros ($81 million), includes
developing digital applications to assist passengers at stations
and via mobile phones, to navigate routes and distances on
public transport more efficiently, said the ministry. Tenders
must be submitted between Feb. 21 and March 31.  Eighty percent of the project will be funded by the  European
Regional Development Fund  and 20 percent by the Greek
government, said the ministry today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
