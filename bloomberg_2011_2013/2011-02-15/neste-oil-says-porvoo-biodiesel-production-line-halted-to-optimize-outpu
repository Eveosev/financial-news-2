  Neste Oil Oyj , Finland’s only oil
refiner, said one of the Porvoo NExBTL renewable diesel
production lines was halted for output optimization purposes,
spokesman Osmo Kammonen said by phone today.  Neste Oil is shipping large volumes of diesel from  Singapore , Kammonen said. The diesel line is also due to undergo
normal maintenance, Kammonen said. Neste Oil’s delivery volumes
are not affected by the stoppage, Kammonen said. Neste Oil slid
to its lowest since Jan. 20, falling 1.2 percent to 12.88 euros
at 11:03 a.m. in Helsinki.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
