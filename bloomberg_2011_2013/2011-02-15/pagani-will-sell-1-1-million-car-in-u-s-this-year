Pagani Automobili SpA, the Italian
supercar maker, said it will sell the $1.1 million,
700-horsepower Huayra gull-wing coupe in the U.S. beginning this
year to meet growing demand for pricey cars.  Pagani hopes to sell about 5 cars in the U.S. in 2012 and
maybe as many as 10 in future years, said Francesco Zappacosta,
Pagani’s managing director. While the company hasn’t yet
announced dealers, two locations have been identified, he said.  “In the U.S., in particular, we’ve gotten a lot of
requests for the car,” Zappacosta said in a telephone
interview. “We have about a three-year waiting list as of right
now,” Zappacosta said.  Pagani is entering the U.S. market as high-end luxury auto
brands have increased after the recession. U.S. sales of  Fiat
SpA ’s Maserati rose 48 percent last year compared with 2009 with
the introduction of the GranTurismo Convertible. The brand sold
1,897 vehicles in the U.S. last year.  U.S. sales of Fiat’s Ferrari rose 13 percent to 1,897,
according to researcher Autodata Corp. While  Volkswagen AG ’s
U.S. sales of Bentley brand rose 4.6 percent to 1,430,
Lamborghini’s deliveries fell 16 percent to 290, Autodata said.  “We see this as an unprecedented opportunity to continue
expanding our vision of the future for the supercar industry,”
Horacio Pagani, founder of the San Cesario sul Panaro, Italy-
based company, said in a statement.  Pagani, which has made about 130 cars in the past 10 years,
sold 15 cars last year and had revenue of about 15 million euros
($20 million), Zappacosta said.  “We’re very small,” he said. “It’s always been
profitable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
