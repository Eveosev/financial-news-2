Crude oil in  New York  tumbled to the
lowest price in 11 weeks and gasoline futures dropped on
forecasts U.S. supplies of the motor fuel will increase.  Futures fell 0.6 percent as a Bloomberg News survey showed
gasoline stockpiles rose 1.85 million barrels last week from
240.9 million, the highest level since 1990. Crude oil supplies
at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the biggest U.S. trading hub, rose to the
highest level since at least 2004 in the week ended Jan. 28.
Gasoline and oil were also led lower by Brent crude in  London .  “Gasoline inventories here are very, very robust, and
demand here is still very poor,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of
research for IAF Advisors in Houston. Brent and WTI are
“divorced” because of near-record oil stockpiles at Cushing,
the delivery point for the New York contract, he said.  Oil for March delivery slipped 49 cents to settle at $84.32
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest level
since Nov. 30. Futures have risen 14 percent in the past year.  Prices were little changed from the settlement after the  American Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S.
crude-oil stockpiles decreased 354,000 barrels to 345.6 million.
March oil fell 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $84.35 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:32 p.m.  Gasoline for March delivery dropped 2.86 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.4888 a gallon on the Nymex. Prices have increased
29 percent in the past year.  Total gasoline supplied, a measure of fuel demand,
decreased 0.3 percent to 8.52 million barrels a day in the week
ended Feb. 4, the lowest level since Feb. 12, 2010, according to
a U.S. Energy Department report last week. Consumption has
declined for six consecutive weeks.  Brent Drops    Brent crude  for April settlement dropped $1.44, or 1.4
percent, to $101.64 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London. Yesterday it rose to $103.08, the highest settlement
since September 2008, following the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  last week.  Brent’s gains have outpaced those of New York crude this
year as inventories in Cushing reached 38.3 million barrels, the
highest level since the Energy Department started keeping
records, in the week ended Jan. 28. They fell 927,000 barrels,
or 2.4 percent, to 37.4 million in the week to Feb. 4.  The supply situation has widened the difference between
Brent and New York futures to $14.07 a barrel today. The spread
averaged 76 cents last year.  WTI “continues to feel the pressure of increased stocks
and fundamental bottlenecks in Cushing,” JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analysts led by  Lawrence Eagles  said in a note today.  Oil for April delivery on the Nymex decreased $1.16, or 1.3
percent, to $87.57 a barrel. The March West Texas Intermediate
contract in New York expires on Feb. 22.  U.S. Supplies  Overall U.S. crude inventories probably rose for a fifth
week in the seven days ended Feb. 11 as TransCanada Corp.
completed an extension of a pipeline to Cushing, adding to the
glut at the country’s biggest oil-trading hub, a Bloomberg News
survey showed. TransCanada started deliveries to Cushing on Feb.
8 in the second phase of its Keystone pipeline project.  U.S. supplies advanced 2 million barrels, or 0.6 percent,
last week from 345.1 million a week earlier, according to the
median estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Oil also fell as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined
from a 32-month high after U.S. retail sales grew less than
economists forecast and prices of imported goods climbed.  The  S&P 500  slipped 0.4 percent to 1,327.14, and the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  dropped 55.25 points, or 0.5 percent,
to 12,212.94 at 3:29 p.m. in New York.  U.S. Economy  U.S. retail sales increased 0.3 percent in January, the
smallest gain since a drop in June, Commerce Department figures
showed today in Washington. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 0.5 percent rise.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index rose to 15.4 in February from 11.9 in January. Readings
greater than zero signal expansion.  Earlier, prices surged the most in two weeks as
demonstrators clashed with security forces in Bahrain, Yemen and  Iran , the second-largest OPEC producer, renewing concern that
supplies may be disrupted.  “People are watching with one eye the Middle East and
trying to figure out how does this dovetail with economic
statistics that are patchy or spotty,” said  Peter Beutel ,
president of trading advisory company Cameron Hanover Inc. in  New Canaan ,  Connecticut . “The economic data has not been as
persuasive as the stock market has been.”  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 773,985
contracts as of 3:29 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 897,007
contracts yesterday, 23 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.57 million contracts, the
highest level since Sept. 12, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
