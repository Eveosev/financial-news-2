The number of condominiums offered
for sale in Tokyo and surrounding areas fell for the first time
in a year last month, ending the region’s longest streak of
gains since February 2000 when sales rose for 18 straight months.  The number of new apartments put on the market dropped 14
percent in January from a year earlier, the Real Estate Economic
Research Institute said in a report. The drop is the first since
January 2010.  The percentage of units sold before completion remains
above 70 percent, the level needed for builders to make a profit,
according to the report.  The average apartment price for the Tokyo region, which
includes the surrounding prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and
Kanagawa, rose 2.4 percent to 42.4 million yen ($508,000),
today’s report showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
