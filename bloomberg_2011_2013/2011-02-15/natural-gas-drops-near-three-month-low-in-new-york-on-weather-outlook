Natural gas futures rose for a
second day on revised forecasts showing below-normal
temperatures in the central and eastern U.S. at the end of
February.  Gas rose 1.3 percent as midday updates from forecasters
including MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather predicted
colder-than-normal weather across the Northeast and parts of the
Midwest from Feb. 25 through March 1. Earlier forecasts from the
Rockville, Maryland-based company showed normal or above-normal
temperatures in those regions.  “You can have some cold episodes in February,” said Carl Neill, an energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta.
“Prices may bounce a little, but the market’s still in a
seasonal slide as we get closer to the end of the winter.”  Natural gas for March delivery rose 5.1 cents to settle at
$3.976 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 27 percent from a
year ago.  The low temperature in New York on Feb. 28 may be 24
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4 Celsius), 7 degrees below normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
The low in  Detroit  may be 16 degrees, 7 degrees below normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  “There is a cold front moving to the East in two weeks and
that helped gas,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG
Economics, an energy research firm in  London ,  Arkansas . “There
may be a substantial withdrawal in Thursday’s report and some of
the price changes could be people betting on that report.”  Stockpile Report  The Energy Department may report a larger-than-normal
withdrawal from U.S. gas  inventories  on Feb. 17 because of cold
weather last week.  About 237 billion cubic feet of gas were withdrawn from
storage in the week ended Feb. 11, above the five-year average
decline for the week of 150 billion, according to the median of
10 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. gas stockpiles declined 209 billion cubic feet in the
week ended Feb. 4 to 2.144 trillion, the Energy Department
reported last week.  The storage drop was bigger than the five-year average
decline of 159 billion cubic feet, department data showed. The
storage level was 2.1 percent below the five-year average,
declining to a deficit for the first time since Jan. 15, 2010.  Gulf South Pipeline Co., a unit of  Boardwalk Pipeline
Partners LP , reduced gas flows through a line in  Texas  after a
fire in a compressor station, said Allison McLean, a Boardwalk
spokeswoman in Houston.  Texas Gas  Boardwalk owns and operates more than 14,000 miles (22,526
kilometers) of pipelines in 12 states, according to the
company’s  website .  Scheduled gas delivery to the Texas power plants declined 1
percent to 1.07 million dekatherms (about 1.04 billion cubic
feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Scheduled gas
deliveries to the state’s residents dropped 14 percent to
600,111 dekatherms.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
248,534 as of 3:31 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 303,000. Volume was 297,149 yesterday. Open interest was
940,734 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
805,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
