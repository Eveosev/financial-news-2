The euro may fall to a four-week low
against the dollar after it slid below support at about $1.3494,
according to Okasan Securities Co., citing trading patterns.  The $1.3494 level represented a so-called neckline of a
head-and-shoulders formed by the “left shoulder” on Jan. 27,
the “head” on Feb. 2 and the “right shoulder” on Feb. 9,
said  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency dealer at Okasan. The
breach of the neckline connecting the base of the three peaks,
which signals the reversal of a trend, suggests the euro may
drop to at least $1.3364, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the currency’s rise from its Jan. 10 low, he said.  “The break of the neckline around $1.35 would possibly
lead to a full retracement of the rally since January,” Tokyo-
based Soma said. “The euro’s target would be significantly to
the downside.”  The euro traded at $1.3485 as of 9:21 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.3489 in  New York  yesterday, when it declined to $1.3428, the
lowest level since Jan. 20. The $1.3364 level was last seen on
Jan. 18. The single currency has fallen 2.7 percent since
reaching its Feb. 2 high of $1.3862.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates a currency
may move to the next level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support is where buy orders may be
clustered, while resistance is where there may be sell orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
