The European Union decided to cap
carbon dioxide from commercial vans, going beyond new curbs on
car emissions in the latest crackdown on transport pollution
that contributes to climate change.  The European Parliament voted to limit CO2 from “light
commercial vehicles” made by companies such as  Volkswagen AG ,
PSA Peugeot Citroen and  Fiat SpA . The law, which extends to
foreign producers, will reduce average CO2 emissions from new
vans sold in the EU by 14 percent to 175 grams (6.2 ounces) a
kilometer (0.6 mile) as of 2017 compared with 2007.  The rules are modeled on EU legislation that will cut car
CO2 emissions by a fifth on average in 2015 to 130 grams a
kilometer through varying targets for individual manufacturers,
with those curbs being phased in between 2012 and 2015. EU
governments have signaled support for the van cap, making their
final approval a formality in coming weeks.  “Just as the passenger car sector is making strides toward
reduced emissions, so should the light commercial vehicle
sector,” said Martin Callanan, a U.K. member who steered the
law through the 27-nation EU Parliament today in Strasbourg,  France . The cap, to be backed by financial penalties, will cover
70 percent of the van fleet in 2014, 75 percent in 2015 and 80
percent in 2016 before rising to 100 percent as of 2017.    Climate Change   Wider European curbs on the transport industry’s greenhouse
gases including CO2, the main such pollutant, bolster an EU goal
to cut these emissions by at least 20 percent in 2020 from 1990
levels. The bloc is considering ways to deepen that reduction
target to as much as 30 percent to counter the heat waves,
storms and floods tied to climate change.  In 2008, in addition to approving caps on CO2 from cars, EU
lawmakers decided to limit airline emissions by adding carriers
beginning in 2012 to the European emissions-trading system for
power plants and factories. The bloc may also restrict CO2 from
trucks and is threatening to impose its own emission curbs on
ships should the  United Nations  fail to tackle the maritime
industry’s greenhouse gases on a global level.  Some 1.5 million new vans were sold in the EU in 2010,
representing about one-ninth of the region’s car market,
according to the  European Automobile Manufacturers Association .
These commercial vehicles account for about 1.5 percent of total
EU CO2 emissions, according to the European Commission, the
bloc’s regulatory arm in Brussels.  Price Increases  The average price of vans in the EU may rise about 1,100
euros ($1,354) because of the 2017 cap, says the commission,
which proposed a tougher version of the legislation in 2009.
Manufacturers that exceed their targets would pay penalties to
be phased in from 2014, with the maximum fine reaching 95 euros
for every gram per kilometer above the limits, multiplied by the
number of vehicles sold, as of 2019. That mirrors the penalty
system under the car-cap law.  The commission had proposed fines as high as 120 euros for
every gram per kilometer above the van limits as of 2019. The
commission also wanted the phase-in of the 175-gram-a-kilometer
cap to be completed a year earlier in 2016.  “I would have preferred a more ambitious outcome,” EU
Climate Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard  said. “Nevertheless, this
compromise still represents an important step forward.”  The new law also foresees a 2020 van cap of 147 grams of
CO2 a kilometer -- a limit that will need to be confirmed as
part of a review due in 2013. That cap would probably push up
the price of vans by around 2,000 euros, according the
commission, which had proposed a 2020 cap of 135 grams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
