  Asia  gasoil rose to the highest
level since September 2008 as Winson Oil Trading Pte. sold
cargoes in Singapore at a reduced discount. Royal Dutch Shell
Plc bought fuel oil and jet fuel.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan gained 1.9

delivery in the 12 months starting April at the same price as
the contract a year earlier, two people with knowledge of the
talks said.  The company offered supplies of Full-Range naphtha from
April through March 2012 at a premium of $22 a ton to Middle
Eastern benchmark prices of the fuel, the people said,
requesting anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.
Company officials are in price discussions with buyers in  Singapore , they said.  Middle Distillates  Benchmark gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur
increased $1.90, or 1.7 percent, to $116.75 a barrel, according
to Bloomberg data. Jet fuel climbed $2.15, or 1.8 percent, to
$118.90. Each product rose to the highest since September 2008.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude dropped 56 cents to $17.87

cents a barrel over quotes, traders said. That’s the first

mainly used as marine fuel, gained 2.5 percent to $602.75.  Shell bought 40,000 tons of 380-centistoke  fuel oil  from
