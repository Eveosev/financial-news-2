  Repsol YPF SA  started a gasoil
desulfurization plant at its Petronor refinery in Bilbao,  Spain ,
following planned maintenance that began last month.  “The sequence to start the G4 gasoil desulfurization unit
has begun,” the Madrid-based company said in a statement on the
Petronor website yesterday. The plant was shut on Jan. 14 for 44
days, it said last week.  The refinery has the capacity to process 220,000 barrels
of crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
