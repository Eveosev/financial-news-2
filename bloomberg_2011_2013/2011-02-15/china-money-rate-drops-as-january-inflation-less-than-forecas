  China ’s benchmark money-market rate
fell to the lowest level in a month on speculation the central
bank may pursue less aggressive monetary tightening after
inflation in January was less than what economists predicted.  Consumer prices rose 4.9 percent in January from a year
earlier, compared with the median forecast of 5.4 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “We may see less aggressive tightening in the short term
as a result of the below-5 percent CPI,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based economist at Credit Agricole CIB.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of liquidity in the
financial system, fell eight basis points to 2.64 percent, the
lowest level since 2.58 percent on Jan. 17, according to a daily
fixing published by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, which is tied to the repo rate,
dropped one basis point to 3.76 percent as of 11:15 a.m. in  Shanghai .  The yield on the government’s 3.77 percent bond due
December 2020 slipped three basis points to 4.04 percent,
according to Chinabond. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The People’s Bank of China said today it sold one-year
bills at a yield of 2.9972 percent, 27.5 basis points higher
than at a sale on Jan. 11. The People’s Bank raised the yield on
three-month bills by 36.5 basis points to 2.6242 percent at an
auction on Feb. 10.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
