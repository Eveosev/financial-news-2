Ukraine aims to attract private
investment in government-run coal mines to increase production,
Deputy Coal and Energy Minister Ihor Popovych said.  The government has drawn up investment plans for state
mines in 2011 envisaging 5.5 billion hryvnia ($691 million) of
spending, Popovych said in an interview published today by
official government newspaper Uryadovyi Kurier.  Of the total amount, 1.6 billion hryvnia would consist of
bank loans, mines would provide 1.1 billion hryvnia and 800
million hryvnia would come from other sources, according to
Popovych. He also said 2 billion hryvnia would come from finance
leasing, without being more specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
