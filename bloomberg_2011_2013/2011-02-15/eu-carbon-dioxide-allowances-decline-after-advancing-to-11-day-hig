European Union carbon allowances for
December fell as 2012 German power declined, reducing the
incentive to sell electricity in forward markets.  EU carbon permits dropped as much as 0.6 percent to 14.80
euros ($20.04) a metric ton and were at 14.83 euros a ton as of
9:24 a.m. on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . German
power for next year declined 0.2 percent to 52 euros a megawatt
hour, according to prices from brokers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
