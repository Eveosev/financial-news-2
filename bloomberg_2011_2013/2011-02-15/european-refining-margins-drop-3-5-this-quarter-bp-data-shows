Refining profits in northwest  Europe 
have fallen 3.5 percent so far in the first quarter compared
with the final three months of 2010, trailing  Asia  and the U.S.
west coast.  Earnings from refining in the region averaged $10.89 a
barrel, down from $11.29 in the fourth quarter, according to
London-based  BP Plc ’s  website .  Under new methodology used to calculate margins, Asian
refiners were the most profitable at $14.14 a barrel, BP data
showed. Under the old method, Asia was the least profitable of
the six regions surveyed by BP.  The U.S. west coast was the second-highest earner in the
period with $12.51 a barrel, according to BP. Refiners along the
U.S. Gulf Coast theoretically earned $10.63 a barrel.  Margins for refiners in the Mediterranean averaged $9.97 a
barrel, followed by the U.S. Midwest at $3.63 a barrel,
according to BP.  BP’s Refining Marker Margin, a broad measure of global
refining profitability, averaged $10.23 a barrel from $9.98 in
the previous quarter. The measure is a generic number derived
from third-party data, using typical regional crudes and product
yields, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
