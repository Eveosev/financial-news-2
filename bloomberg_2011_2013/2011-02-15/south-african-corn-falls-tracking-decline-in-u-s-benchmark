the South African Futures Exchange, dropped 68.20 rand, or 3.9
percent, to end trade at 1,677.80 rand ($230) a metric ton. Meal
made from the grain is the country’s staple food.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 10.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $7.065 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade

biggest growers, intend to expand acreage this year after prices
surged. The contract was little changed in electronic trading
today.  In South Africa, yellow corn for July delivery declined 61
rand, or 3.4 percent, to 1,726 rand a ton. The country mainly

3,410 rand a ton.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
