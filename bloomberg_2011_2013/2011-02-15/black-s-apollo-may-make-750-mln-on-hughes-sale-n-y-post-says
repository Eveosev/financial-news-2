  Leon Black ’s Apollo Capital
Management LLC will make an estimated $750 million from  EchoStar
Corp .’s $2.1 billion acquisition of  Hughes Communications Inc .,
the New York Post reported, citing people familiar with the
matter.  In 2004 Apollo’s affiliate SkyTerra paid about $50 million
for a 50 percent stake in Hughes, and since then Apollo has
built its holding to 57 percent; the deal is still subject to
regulatory approval, the newspaper said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
