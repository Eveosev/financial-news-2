A Spanish consular official was
detained for four hours in Tehran yesterday, prompting protests
from  Spain ’s government.  The incident was “very grave” and “unacceptable,”
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez told reporters in  Madrid  today
in televised comments. Ignacio Perez Cambra, the embassy
official responsible for consular affairs, was detained and
released without charges, said a ministry official who declined
to be named in line with policy.  Spain summoned the Iranian ambassador in Madrid and has
sent a note of verbal protest to the Iranian authorities, the
official said. High-level visits between the two countries have
been frozen, Jimenez told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
