CVC Capital Partners Ltd, the
private equity firm that owns motor racing’s Formula One Group,
and the board of Formula One’s holding company, Delta Topco,
have appointed Ernst & Young LLP and law firm Freshfields,
Bruckhaus and Deringer to investigate the circumstances
surrounding the Formula One takeover in 2006, Sky News City
Editor Mark Kleinman  reported , without saying where he got the
information.  The probe follows the arrest by Munich prosecutors of
former Bayerische Landesbank chief risk officer Gerhard
Gribkowsky on charges related to the sale of the bank’s stake in
Formula One to CVC Capital in 2006, Kleinman said.  CVC Capital and Formula One declined to comment, Kleinman
said. James Olley, a spokesman for CVC, declined to comment when
