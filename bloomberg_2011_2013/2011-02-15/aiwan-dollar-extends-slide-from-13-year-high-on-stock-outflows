  Taiwan ’s dollar fell for a fourth
day, its longest losing streak since October, as some investors
judged excessive the rally that drove the currency to a 13-year
high last week.  Global funds sold $2 billion more Taiwanese shares than
they bought in the last four days, more than one-fifth of their
total net purchases in 2010. The currency has strengthened 8.6
percent in the past six months, the best performance among
Asia’s 10 most-used currencies.  “We’d been seeing pretty much endless appreciation of the  Taiwan dollar  before the slump began; it is difficult to predict
when this wave of declines will stop,” said  Henry Lin , a
foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank in
Taipei. “Traders thought there would be a support level at
NT$29.5, but it fell past that yesterday. I guess NT$29.8 is the
next one.”  Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.3 percent to NT$29.404 against its
U.S. counterpart as of 12:54 p.m. local time, after sliding 0.8
percent in the last three days, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
It reached NT$28.755 on Feb. 9, the strongest level since
October 1997.  The local dollar’s rise fanned concern about the island’s
“export competitiveness and earnings risk,” Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. analysts led by Kinger Lau wrote in a report today.
Overseas sales climbed 17 percent from a year earlier in January,
the slowest growth since October 2009, the government reported
Feb. 11.  Concern shipments may cool was heightened last week after  China , Taiwan’s biggest overseas market, raised  interest rates 
for the third time in four months to help tame inflation.
Chinese consumer prices rose 4.9 percent from a year earlier in
January, after a 4.6 percent gain in December, according to
government data released today.  Taiwan’s benchmark five-year bonds were little changed. The
yield on the 1 percent note due January 2016 was 1.118 percent,
from 1.119 percent yesterday, according to Gretai Securities
Market, the island’s biggest debt exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
