Cocoa growers in  Ivory Coast  who
support  Laurent Gbagbo , a claimant to the presidency, are
seeking new buyers in Russia and  China  as European Union
sanctions hinder exports of the chocolate ingredient.  “We are in pursuit of new partners,” said Sansan Kouao,
vice president of Conseil National des Sages, a group of cocoa
farmers appointed by Gbagbo in 2007. The growers will soon make
a trip to the countries “to find markets,” he said during a
meeting of the group in Abidjan, the commercial capital, today.  The EU’s trade and travel bans against Gbagbo, his
associates and institutions that support him include the main
cocoa-exporting ports at Abidjan and San Pedro. Gbagbo refuses
to cede power to  Alassane Ouattara , the internationally
recognized winner of a Nov. 28 presidential election.  Ouattara called on exporters to halt shipments of cocoa and
coffee for one month until Feb. 23. May-delivery cocoa declined
$21, or 0.6 percent, to $3,385 per metric ton by 1:53 p.m. on
the ICE Futures exchange in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
