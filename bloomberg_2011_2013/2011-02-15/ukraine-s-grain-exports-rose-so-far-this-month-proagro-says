Ukraine’s grain exports climbed 72
percent in the first 10 days this month from the same period a
month earlier, researcher ProAgro said, citing ports data.  Outbound shipments of wheat, barley and corn were 144,100
metric tons in Feb. 1 to Feb. 10, compared with 83,700 tons in
the same period in January, Kiev-based researcher ProAgro said
in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Wheat exports advanced to 21,100 tons from 6,800 tons, the
researcher said. Barley shipments increased to 46,500 tons from
2,500 tons and corn exports climbed to 76,500 tons from 74,400
tons, ProAgro said.  Ukraine imposed curbs on grain exports last year, limiting
shipments through the end of this March. The total limit for
corn, barley and wheat is currently at 4.2 million tons.  Sunflower oil exports also increased in the period, to
60,200 tons from 37,800 tons a month earlier, according to the
researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
