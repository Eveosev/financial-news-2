  Arcade Fire , Mumford & Sons and
Tinie Tempah were winners at the Brit music awards in 
London tonight.  Arcade Fire’s “The Suburbs” was the best international
album, following the Canadian group’s similar success at this
year’s Grammy awards.  Take That, which reunited with former member Robbie 
Williams last year, was named best British group.  Tinie Tempah was named the winner of best British
breakthrough artist and his song “Pass Out” won best U.K.
single.  Rihanna was best international female solo artist. Mumford
& Sons took the prize for the best U.K. album with “Sigh No
More.”  A win may add as much as 5 million pounds ($8 million) to
an album’s sales, a certain boon for record-company bosses at
the O2 event. Winners also receive a Brit statuette.  The  Brits  are the  British Phonographic Industry’s  annual
pop-music awards and presented in one form or another since
1977. They have been sponsored by  Mastercard Inc . for the last
13 years.  (Mark Beech writes for Bloomberg News. The opinions
