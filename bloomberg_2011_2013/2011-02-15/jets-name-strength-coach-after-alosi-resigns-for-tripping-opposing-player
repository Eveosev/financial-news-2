The  New York Jets  named Bill Hughan
strength and conditioning coach to succeed Sal Alosi, who
resigned after tripping an opposing player during a game.  Hughan was the assistant strength and conditioning coach
for the Atlanta Falcons the past three seasons and served in the
same capacity with the Oakland Raiders for the previous four
years.  Alosi quit on Jan. 31, seven weeks after he tripped Nolan Carroll of the  Miami Dolphins  as the rookie cornerback ran along
the Jets’ sideline on punt coverage. Alosi was fined $25,000 and
indefinitely suspended.  Bryan Dermody will remain the National Football League
team’s assistant strength and conditioning coach, the Jets said
in a news release. Financial terms of Hughan’s hiring weren’t
disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
