A surplus of supertankers competing
for 2 million-barrel cargoes of Middle East oil shrank, nearing
parity with likely cargoes as demand to collect the region’s
crude strengthens.  There are 7 percent more very large crude carriers, or
VLCCs, for hire over the next 30 days than there are likely
cargoes, according to the median estimate of six shipbrokers and
two owners surveyed today. That’s down from a 15 percent excess
on Feb. 9.  Daily rental income from the industry’s benchmark Saudi
Arabia-to-Japan trade route has jumped more than sixfold so far
this month, advancing 4.5 percent to $48,333 a day today,
according to the London-based  Baltic Exchange .  “It’s been a busy month and the list of ships wasn’t that
long,” said Ben Goggin, a freight derivatives broker at SSY
Futures Ltd., a unit of the world’s second-largest shipbroker.  The current return exceeds the $31,300 that Frontline Ltd.,
the world’s biggest VLCC operator, needs to break even on the
ships. It’s above the $12,777 that Drewry Shipping Consultants
Ltd. estimates the vessels need to pay crew, repairs and other
running costs.  Charter rates as measured in industry standard Worldscale
terms rose 2.8 percent to 82 points today, according to the
Baltic Exchange.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a wider measure of crude oil
transportation costs, added 3.1 percent to 736 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
