European stocks rose for a third
day, sending the Stoxx Europe 600 Index to its highest level
since September 2008, as companies from  Barclays Plc  to Danone
posted results that beat analysts’ estimates.  Barclays, Britain’s third-largest bank, climbed 5.8
percent. UniCredit SpA led Italian stocks higher. Danone, the
world’s biggest yogurt maker, advanced 3.3 percent.  Deutsche
Boerse AG  fell as the exchange operator agreed to combine with
NYSE Euronext.  Rio Tinto  Group, the third-largest mining
company, paced mining stocks lower.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.1 percent to 289.44 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London . The measure has gained 83 percent from the 12-
year low that it reached in March 2009 as investors bet the
strengthening global economic recovery will help boost corporate
profits. About 56 percent of the companies in the index that
have reported annual profit since Jan. 10 have topped analysts’
estimates for per-share profit, Bloomberg data show.  “For the moment, the motor is the transfer of money into
stocks and that’s confirmed by 2010 earnings,” said Yves Maillot, head of investments at Robeco Gestion in Paris, which
oversees $5.41 billion. “Earnings have been the wind carrying
the market. In the short term, we may have a correction. For the
past month, investors have been looking at all of the positive
points. We could have new questions on the situation as a
whole.”  The rally in the Stoxx 600 has pushed the measure to about
15.5 times the reported earnings of its companies, near the
highest level in nine months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  More Bullish  Money managers are more bullish on global stocks this month
than at any time in the past decade, according to a BofA Merrill
Lynch Global Research survey. A net 67 percent of respondents,
who together manage $569 billion, had an “overweight” position
on global equities, the highest level since the survey first
asked the question in April 2001.  In the U.S., a report showed January retail sales rose 0.3
percent, less than the forecast for a 0.5 percent increase in a
survey of economists.  Elsewhere, a gauge of investor confidence in  Germany 
increased for a fourth month in February and U.K. inflation
accelerated to the fastest pace in more than two years in
January. In  China , where the central bank last week raised  interest rates , inflation climbed in January 4.9 percent,
exceeding the government’s 2011 for a fourth month.  Benchmark gauges in Italy, Portugal and  Spain  rose the most
out of 18 western European markets. The region’s governments
agreed to double the lending capacity of the rescue fund for
debt-laden countries in 2013, while seeing no need for immediate
steps to shield  Portugal  from the fiscal crisis.  Emergency Aid  Finance ministers decided that the future emergency aid
mechanism will be able to lend 500 billion euros ($675 billion),
twice the size of the fund set up in the wake of  Greece ’s near-
default last year.  National benchmark indexes rose in 10 of the 18 western
European markets. France’s CAC 40 climbed 0.3 percent and
Germany’s DAX rose 0.1 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 0.4
percent.  Barclays gained 5.8 percent to 328.75 pence. The bank said
full-year net income was 3.6 billion pounds ($5.77 billion),
beating a forecast of 3.2 billion pounds in a survey of
analysts, as investment-banking profit almost doubled and
writedowns shrank.  UniCredit, Italy’s largest bank, increased 3.3 percent to
1.91 euros. The stock was raised to “buy” from “sell” at
Societe Generale SA.  Water Sales    Danone , the world’s biggest yogurt maker, advanced 3.3
percent to 45.42 euros. The company said full-year profit rose
18 percent on sales of Aqua bottled water and Dumex infant
formula in  Asia .  Profit from continuing businesses and excluding one-time
items rose to 1.67 billion euros from 1.41 billion euros a year
ago, the company said. The median estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News was for profit at that level of 1.66 billion
euros.  Deutsche Boerse AG lost 2.4 percent to 59.85 euros. The
operator of the Frankfurt bourse and NYSE Euronext said they
will combine, creating the world’s largest owner of equities and
derivatives markets.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc , which last
week agreed to buy Canada’s TMX Group Inc., slid 3.2 percent to
900 pence.  Mining Stocks  Rio Tinto fell 2.8 percent to 4,550 pence. Kazakhmys Plc,
Kazakhstan’s biggest copper miner, lost 2.6 percent to 1,538
pence. A gauge of basic-resource companies on the Stoxx 600
slipped 1.8 percent, the worst performance out of 19 industry
groups.    Anglo American Plc , which controls the world’s largest
producer of platinum, slipped 3.8 percent to 3,306.5 pence. The
stock was cut to “hold” from “buy” at Citigroup.    Imtech NV  fell 1.5 percent to 27.82 euros. The largest
Dutch technical-services company said full-year net income rose
to 140 million euros from 126 million euros a year earlier. That
compares to a forecast for 141 million euros in a survey of
analysts.    Trelleborg AB , the world’s biggest maker of vibration-
dampening gear, tumbled 10 percent to 62.85 kronor after
reporting quarterly earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Micro Focus Plc sank 26 percent to 291 pence, the biggest
drop since August, after the  software company  said revenue and
adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization in the three months ended Jan. 31 were below
management forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
