  Australia  and New Zealand agreed to
clear the way for greater investment by raising the thresholds
at which regulators need to review the proposal.  Australian investors will be able to invest as much as
NZ$477 million ($359 million) in New Zealand without regulatory
approval, while New Zealanders can invest about A$1 billion
($997 million). The agreement was signed by Australian Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  and her New Zealand counterpart John Key
in Wellington today.  Australia and New Zealand want to create a single economic
market by harmonizing regulations and removing barriers to
investment, building on the Closer Economic Relationship, a
free-trade agreement that has been in place since 1983. Gillard
is ending a two-day official visit to  New Zealand , and earlier
today became the first foreign leader to speak in parliament’s
debating chamber.  The investment protocol “will make investment simpler and
cheaper, creating employment and opportunity on both side of the
Tasman,” Gillard told lawmakers, referring to the  Tasman Sea 
that separates the two nations.  “For New Zealand, this agreement provides the most
liberalized access to the Australian investment market,” she
said. “For Australia, it makes CER our most liberal and
comprehensive trade agreement.”  Previously, Australian investors needed clearance to spend
more than NZ$100 million in New Zealand, and New Zealanders had
to seek approval for purchases exceeding A$231 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
