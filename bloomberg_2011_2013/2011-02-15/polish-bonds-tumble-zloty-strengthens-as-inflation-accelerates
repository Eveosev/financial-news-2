Polish bonds fell the most in more
than a month and the zloty gained after a report showed Polish
inflation accelerated more than expected, prompting speculation
the Narodowy Bank Polski will raise  interest rates  next month.  The bond sell-off pushed the yield on zero-coupon notes up
11 basis points, the biggest jump since Jan. 5, to 5.145 percent
by 3:25 p.m. in Warsaw. The zloty rallied 0.6 percent against
the euro, the most among more than 20 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, to 3.9201 per euro.  Investors in interest-rate derivatives raised bets the
central bank will increase rates at a meeting on March 2 after
Poland said January consumer prices rose an annual 3.8 percent
after a 3.1 percent pace in December. The median estimate by 25
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 3.4 percent.  “We expect another hike from the NBP in early March,”
Anders Svendsen, Copenhagen-based chief analyst at Nordea Bank
AB, wrote in a report to clients after the data was published.
“The hawks may start calling for 50 basis-point rate hikes.”  Forward-rate agreements fixing interest costs a month from
today rose to 4.2232 percent, the highest in more than a month,
from 4.2116 percent yesterday. The one-month FRA contract is
trading 10 basis points above the three-month Warsaw Interbank
Offered Rate to which it settles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
