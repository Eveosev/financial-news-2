Cyprus’s direct-tax revenue fell an
annual 5 percent in January to 217.5 million euros ($293.6
million), mainly because of a drop in the defense levy, the east
Mediterranean island’s  Inland Revenue Department  said.  The  defense tax , applied to dividends, interest, rents and
taxable income of public corporate bodies to help pay for the
country’s armed forces, fell 11 percent to 109.2 million euros,
the IRD said in a  statement  on its website today. Corporate
taxation fell 6 percent to 40.4 million euros.  The combined drop was partly offset by a 15 percent
increase in income tax paid by employees to 48.8 million euros,
according to the statement.  The budget deficit of the euro area’s third-smallest
economy is expected to narrow this year to below 4 percent of
economic output from 5.5 percent in 2010, Finance Minister
Charilaos Stavrakis said Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
