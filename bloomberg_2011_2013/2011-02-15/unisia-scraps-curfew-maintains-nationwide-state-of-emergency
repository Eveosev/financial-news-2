  Tunisia ’s Interior Ministry extended
state-of-emergency measures and lifted a nationwide curfew that
has been in place since Jan. 13 to counter protests that led to
the ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.  “To maintain calm and avoid violence and in order to
protect the country’s people and public and private buildings,
we maintain the state of emergency indefinitely,” the ministry
said in a statement posted on its website today.  The Tunis-based ministry asked security forces to be
vigilant and to counteract any attempt aimed at destroying
confidence between the police and the national army.  To contact the reporter on this story:
