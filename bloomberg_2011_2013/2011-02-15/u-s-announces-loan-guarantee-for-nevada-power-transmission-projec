The U.S. Department of Energy has
approved a $343 million loan guarantee for a transmission line
project being developed in Nevada by Las Vegas-based utility
holding company  NV Energy Inc . and an affiliate of New York-
based power infrastructure company LS Power Group.  The One Nevada Transmission Line will connect power grids
in northern and southern Nevada, and would be the first
transmission project to receive a loan guarantee from the Energy
Department, the agency said today in a statement.  The ON Line project, as it is called, is expected to cost
about $500 million, Energy Secretary Steven Chu said today in a
conference call. The department has issued loan guarantees or
offers for loan guarantees totaling more than $17.5 billion to
support 18 clean energy projects, according to the statement.  The transmission line will help develop renewable energy
projects “that would be land-locked without this project,”
Michal Segal, chief executive officer of LS Power, said during
the call.  ON Line will run 235 miles (378 kilometers) from Ely,  Nevada , to just north of  Las Vegas . It is the first phase of a
 larger project  that will carry about 2 gigawatts of power
between Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada and  California .  Basin Electric Power Cooperative Inc. received Feb. 9 a
$204 million U.S. Department of Agriculture  loan guarantee  for
its 151.5-megawatt  Crow Lake  wind farm in  South Dakota . The $340
million project is expected to go into commercial operation at
the end of February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
