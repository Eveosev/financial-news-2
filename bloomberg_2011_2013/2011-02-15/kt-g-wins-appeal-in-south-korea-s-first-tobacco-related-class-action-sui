  KT&G Corp .,  South Korea ’s biggest
tobacco company, won an appeal affirming the dismissal of the
country’s first tobacco-related lawsuit, filed by lung cancer
patients and their families.  The Seoul High Court today rejected the appeal of a 2007
lower court judgment that said the plaintiffs failed to prove a
link between their diseases and smoking, Seong Kee Moon, judge
in charge of media relations at the Seoul High Court, said
