  China  has “abundant” grain
reserves to meet demand and the current drought won’t affect
international food prices, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ma Zhaoxu
told reporters in Beijing today.  “The recent drought may have some impact on the winter
wheat production,” Ma said. “But authorities are taking active
measures to minimize the impact.”  China is almost self-sufficient in food, importing only
about 5 percent of its needs, so the country has little impact
on global prices, Ma said.  Wheat futures climbed to a record in China yesterday,
gaining 3.5 percent to 3,104 yuan ($471) a ton, on speculation
the drought will cut China’s production and boost its imports of
the grain. Food prices in China rose 10.3 percent in January
from a year earlier, higher than December’s 9.6 percent
increase, the National Bureau of Statistics reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
