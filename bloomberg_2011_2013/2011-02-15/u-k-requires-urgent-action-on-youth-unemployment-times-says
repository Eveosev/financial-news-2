Hundreds of thousands of young
people in the U.K. face the prospect of poor employment
prospects throughout their lives unless the government takes
“immediate and urgent” action, according to Jonathan Portes,
the new head of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research, the London-based Times reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Portes, who has just
stepped down as chief economist at the Cabinet Office, said
youth unemployment, at close to a million, is the highest since
records began in 1992.  He said research shows that being without work early in
life commonly leads to poorer employment prospects and lower pay
in later years, the Times reported.  Portes criticized as a “major error” the government’s
decision to scrap an education maintenance allowance that has
been used to encourage teenagers from poorer families to stay on
at school after the minimum leaving age, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
