  David Einhorn ’s Greenlight Capital
Inc. bought shares in  BP Plc ,  Sprint Nextel Corp ., and Potash
Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest fertilizer
producer, during the fourth quarter.  Einhorn, who profited from betting against Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008, opened new positions in the three
companies by buying 3.33 million shares of BP, a 379,000 share
stake in Potash and 55.9 million shares of Sprint, during the
quarter that ended in December, according to a filing today with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The New York-based hedge-fund firm also bought a new
position of 1.92 million shares in Tulsa, Oklahoma-based  SemGroup Corp ., which transports energy products, a 2.58 million
share stake in chemical maker  LyondellBasell Industries NV  and
100,000 stocks in Capitol Federal Financial Inc., a Topeka,
Kansas-based bank holding company.  The firm boosted its position in Market Vectors Gold Miners
ETF, an exchange-traded fund providing exposure to publicly
traded gold mining companies, to 3.55 million shares from 2.58
million.  Greenlight recommended a “modest net long position” in a
Nov. 1 letter to clients, while advising against owning too many
stocks should an asset bubble form as prices keep rising. The
firm said the Federal Reserve’s plan to buy an additional $600
billion of U.S. Treasuries through June won’t stimulate the
economy, and helps explain the rally in gold to record levels.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 13 percent since
the end of October, and 97 percent from a 12-year low in March
2009 amid government stimulus measures and higher-than-estimated
earnings. Gold climbed to a record $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7.
Futures for April delivery of the metal rose $4.70, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,365.10 an ounce today on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
