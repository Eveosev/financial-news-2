India will require state agencies to
enforce power distribution and industrial companies’ obligations
to buy electricity from clean sources, the country’s top
regulator said.  Companies that generate their own power and power
distributors face mandatory targets to buy 0.8 percent to 14
percent of their supplies from renewable sources such as wind,
solar and water. Those regulated include  Reliance Infrastructure
Ltd . and Tata Power Co. as well as steel makers, miners and  oil
companies  that often generate electricity at captive plants.  “If they don’t meet the renewable purchase obligation, the
regulator will ask the state nodal agency to purchase it,” said
Pramod Deo, chairman of the Central Electricity Regulatory
Commission, the power regulator, referring to state-level
renewable energy development agencies. “All expenses will be
booked to the distribution company.”  Regulated companies have the option of either sourcing
enough clean power to meet their targets or buying credits from
registered renewable energy plants that earn one certificate for
every megawatt-hour of power sent to the grid. If companies
fail, state agencies can also buy renewable certificates to
ensure the targets are met, Deo said.  Enforcing the targets is critical to the success of  India ’s
new market to trade renewable energy certificates, Vibhav Nuwal,
director of REConnect Energy Solutions Pvt., said in an
interview last month. If the obligations aren’t enforced, the
market could suffer from a lack of buyers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
