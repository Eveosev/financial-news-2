  Spain ’s state holding company Sepi
received authorization to sell stakes in Red Electrica Corp. SA,
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA and  Ebro Foods SA ,
 El Economista  reported.  Sepi’s board met with Spain’s Privatization Committee
yesterday to explain that the operations comply with
transparency requirements and the committee’s report will be
published in coming days, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  The government-run  investment company  said on Jan. 28 that
it plans to sell as much as 10 percent of Red Electrica, up to
2.7 percent of IAG and as much as 8.65 percent in Ebro.  If the three stakes were sold at yesterday’s closing prices
the government would raise 875 million euros ($1.18 billion),
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
