Russian stocks slid for the fifth
day in six after U.S. retail sales increased less than forecast
last month, curbing demand for riskier assets on bets the global
recovery will slow.  The 30-stock Micex Index slid 0.7 percent to 1,695.98 by
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, reversing an earlier gain of as
much as 0.7 percent. OAO Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas export
monopoly, dropped 2.1 percent. OAO Polyus Gold declined 2.3
percent, while OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest lender, fell 1.6
percent. The dollar-denominated RTS decreased 0.7 percent to
1,865.99.  U.S. stock futures slipped after retail purchases increased
0.3 percent, the smallest gain since a drop in June, Commerce
Department data showed. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 0.5 percent rise.  “The short-term driver downwards is U.S. retail sales, but
the sentiment hasn’t been great for Russia for a few days,”
Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF Global Trading
in  London , said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
