Oil gained for the first time in
four days in  New York  as signs stockpiles are shrinking in the
U.S. stoked speculation demand is recovering in the world’s
biggest crude consumer.  Futures advanced as much as 0.7 percent after the industry-
funded American Petroleum Institute yesterday said inventories
slid 354,000 barrels in the seven days ended Feb. 11. Energy
Department data today may show stockpiles increased 2 million
barrels. U.S. industrial production probably gained in January
while European consumer confidence has improved, according to
Bloomberg News surveys. Prices also rose amid reports civil
unrest in the Middle East had spread to  Libya .  “Economic data in the U.S. and  Europe  are getting better
than before and this is encouraging a lot of positive response
from investors putting money into commodities,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity sales manager at broker Newedge in Tokyo.
“Physically there’s no shortage of oil in the world.”  Crude for March delivery gained as much as 59 cents to
$84.91 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $84.69 at 3:50 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract slid to $84.32 yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 30.
Prices have declined 8 percent this month and are 10 percent
higher than a year ago.    Brent crude  for April settlement advanced 58 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $102.22 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in  London  today. It dropped $1.44, or 1.4 percent, to $101.64 a
barrel yesterday.  Oil-supply totals from the API and DOE have moved in the
same direction 75 percent of the time over the past four years.
The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report today at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Fibonacci Level  Futures in London may surge past $142 a barrel, to near the
highest price ever, if futures close above a Fibonacci level at
$104.98, according to technical analysis by brokers PVM Oil
Associates Ltd. Brent climbed to a 28-month high of $104.30 on
Feb. 14 as anti-government demonstrations in North Africa spread
through the Arab world, renewing concern that Middle East crude
supplies may be disrupted.  Hundreds of people are demanding the ouster of the Libyan
government, AP reported today. Demonstrators in Yemen clashed
with police yesterday while Iranian security forces on Feb. 14
used tear gas to break up the biggest anti-government protests
since June 2009. Fighting broke out in Bahrain before the
funeral of one of two protesters killed this week, the official
Bahrain News Agency said.    Iran  is the second-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum-Exporting Countries, pumping about 3.7 million barrels
a day, according to Bloomberg data. Libya’s January output was
1.6 million barrels a day. Bahrain supplied about 32,000 barrels
a day of crude in 2009 and 1.49 billion cubic feet of gas,
according to the national oil and gas authority.  Brent-WTI  New York futures have outpaced London’s Brent this week,
narrowing the spread between the benchmark prices. The
difference between the April contracts was at $14.06 a barrel
today, from $14.35 on Feb. 14. The March West Texas Intermediate
contract in New York expires on Feb. 22.  The spread may shrink to $1 a barrel by year-end partly as
political unrest in the Middle East dissipates, Commerzbank AG’s
analysts said in a report yesterday.  “I’m concerned that the market is overbought,” said
Newedge’s Hasegawa. “Such high  oil prices  are not justified.
For Brent, $105 would be the upper limit while $100 would be a
support level.”  Brent’s 14-day relative strength index, which measures how
fast prices have risen or fallen, advanced to 60.2 today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A reading of 70 or more
signals to some traders that a market is “overbought.” WTI’s
RSI was 35.6 yesterday, the lowest since Aug. 24. A level of 30
may be a sign prices have dropped too far, too fast.  U.S. Inventories  U.S. crude inventories probably rose for a fifth week in
the seven days ended Feb. 11 as TransCanada Corp. completed an
extension of a pipeline to Cushing, adding to the glut at the
country’s biggest oil-trading hub, a Bloomberg News survey
showed. TransCanada started deliveries to Cushing on Feb. 8 in
the second phase of its Keystone pipeline project.  The Energy Department report may show gasoline stockpiles
climbed 1.85 million barrels in the seven days ended Feb. 11,
matching the longest streak of gains since August. The  American
Petroleum Institute  said yesterday that inventories increased
1.24 million barrels to 241 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
