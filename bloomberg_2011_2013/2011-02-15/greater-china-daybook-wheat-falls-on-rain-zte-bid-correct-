(Corrects headline to say wheat fell.)  Wheat futures tumbled the most in
three months on speculation that rainfall will ease the threat
of crop damage from a drought in  China , the world’s largest
producer and consumer.  Wheat futures for May delivery dropped 31.75 cents, or 3.5
percent, to settle at $8.7225 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade on Feb. 15, the biggest drop since Nov.
16. On Feb. 14, the price reached $9.1675, the highest for a
most-active contract since August 2008.  “Persistent” rains fell in the past 24 hours south of the  Yangtze River , with “spotty” precipitation further north,
according to QT Weather.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
