Vattenfall AB, the Nordic region’s
biggest utility, said it’s preparing to restart its 1,048-
megawatt Ringhals-3 nuclear reactor in  Sweden  after an unplanned
halt earlier today.  “The reactor scram was due to a valve failure in the steam
system,” the Stockholm-based company said in a statement to the
Nord Pool Spot AS power exchange. “Valve repair has started.
Preparations for start-up are in progress.”  Ringhals-3 halted today at 12:48 p.m. local time.  E.ON AG 
owns a minority stake in the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
