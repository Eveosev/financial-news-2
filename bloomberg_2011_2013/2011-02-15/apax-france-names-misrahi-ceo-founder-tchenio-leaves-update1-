Maurice Tchenio, founder of Paris-
based  Apax Partners  SA, is stepping down after 39 years at the
helm of the private equity firm, handing the reins to Eddie Misrahi.  Tchenio, 68, sold his controlling stake to partners as the
firm is raising a 700 million-euro ($948 million) pool, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. Misrahi, a 19 year
Apax veteran, becomes chairman and chief executive officer.  “It’s with enthusiasm that I intend to continue to develop
Apax Partners to make it the undisputed mid-market leader in
France,” Misrahi, 56, said in the statement.  Tchenio started what would become Apax with British
financier Ronald Cohen and Greycroft Partners LLC’s head Alan Patricof. The firm first raised  venture capital , gradually
investing in larger companies. Tchenio refused to merge with the
firm’s other offices a decade ago to raise bigger funds because
he wanted to focus on medium-sized companies. During his tenure,
Tchenio backed companies including beauty chain Sephora SA,
which was sold to  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA  in 1997.  “Ensuring Apax Partners’s continued existence was one of
our objectives when we created it in 1972,” Tchenio said in the
statement. “It’s for me a great satisfaction to have
succeeded.”  Apax Partners, which finished investing its current 900
million-euro fund, has secured 600 million euros for its next
one and aims to close it in the next few months, it said. Apax
Partners LLP, based in  London , is investing an 11.2 billion-euro
leveraged buyout fund,  Europe ’s largest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
