Arianespace, the worldâ€™s biggest
launcher of commercial satellites, is seeking savings to counter
rising raw-material costs for its next two rockets, Le Figaro
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Jean-Yves Le Gall.  Management costs can be reduced, Le Gall said in an
interview with the French daily. Opportunities for savings
elsewhere are limited because other European countries that hold
stakes in the company insist on receiving a share of work, he
said, according to Figaro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
