  Suzlon Energy Ltd ., India’s biggest
wind turbine maker, said poor roads are hindering the world’s
fifth-largest wind market from deploying more powerful, energy-
efficient turbines.  “My major problem is logistics,” said Harish Mehta,
director of the Ahmedabad-based company. “With the current
conditions of Indian roads and ports, I find it very difficult
to transport parts for large-capacity turbines to remote
sites.”  Suzlon, which has installed 44 percent of India’s wind
capacity, wants to sell larger turbines, Mehta told a conference
in  New Delhi . Yet India ranks 91st of 139 nations for quality of
infrastructure behind Ethiopia and  Indonesia , according to the
World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index. Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh says infrastructure remains  India ’s
biggest bottleneck to economic growth.  Larger turbines can generate more power at lower wind
speeds. Suppliers such as Suzlon and Vestas Wind Systems A/S are
competing to introduce larger turbines in India as the number of
sites that enjoy high wind speeds dwindle.  Last year, installations of large turbines outstripped
those of less than 1-megawatt capacity for the first time in
India, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
