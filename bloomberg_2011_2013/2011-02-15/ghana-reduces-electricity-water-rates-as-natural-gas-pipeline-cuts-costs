Ghana  will lower the price consumers
pay for electricity starting next month as power-generation
costs declined with availability of natural gas from a regional
pipeline that started last year.  Residential electricity users will see their rates fall as
much as 6.2 percent depending on consumption and industrial
consumers get reductions of between 11.8 and 15.9 percent,
Emmanuel Annan, chairman of the Public Utilities Regulatory
Commission, told reporters in Accra, the capital, today.  The West Africa Gas Pipeline brings natural gas from fields
in  Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s biggest oil producer, to neighboring Benin,
Togo and  Ghana . The Ghanaian commission will now start reviewing
tariffs each quarter, Annan said.  Water costs for residential consumers will fall between 1.2
percent and 1.3 percent from March to May, while industrial
users get reductions of as much as 6.4 percent, Annan said. The
West African nation last reviewed its utility costs in June.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
