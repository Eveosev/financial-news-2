  NEC Corp ., Japan’s biggest maker of
personal computers, will introduce a mini notebook based on  Google Inc .’s Android operating system and featuring a keyboard
as it aims to tap increasing demand in Japan for tablet devices.  The Tokyo-based company will release seven models of the
tablets from March 10 and aims to sell 100,000 units in the
first year, Toshihiro Watanabe, chief manager, personal
solutions business development division at NEC, said today at a
briefing in Tokyo. The clamshell-type devices, which turn on
immediately, and weigh about 700 grams (1.5 pounds), will start
retailing from about 40,000 yen ($479), he said.  NEC is looking to gain from the expanding domestic market
for Android devices, which MM Research Institute forecasts will
triple to 2.4 million units in the year ending March 2013, while
distinguishing its product from competition by offering a
physical keyboard. Tablets introduced by Samsung Electronics
Co.,  Apple Inc .,  Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.  and  Acer Inc .
typically feature keyboards as part of the touch screen.  “Our surveys show there are a lot of consumers who want a
PC-like device that has a keyboard and that boots up without any
wait time,” said Masaki Nakamura, an analyst at Tokyo-based MM
research. “I don’t know whether sales will be as brisk as the
iPhone or the iPad, but it will sell.”  NEC’s LifeTouch devices will compete against tablets
including Apple’s iPad, the  cheapest version  of which sells for
48,800 yen in Japan, and Samsung’s Galaxy that typically costs
between 40,000 yen and 50,000 yen.  Shares of NEC fell 0.4 percent to 241 yen at the 3 p.m.
close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark  Nikkei 225 
Stock Average rose 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
