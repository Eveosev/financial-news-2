Pronova BioPharma ASA, the Norwegian
maker of medicines from fish oil, got 2.28 billion kronor ($393
million) of syndicated loans from three banks.  Nordea Bank AB arranged the multicurrency financing, which
includes term loans and a revolving  credit line , the bank said
in a statement. Money in a revolving credit can be borrowed
again once itâ€™s been repaid.  SEB AB and Swedbank AB joined the deal in syndication,
according to the statement.  Proceeds of the five-year financing replace existing
borrowings maturing in 2012, Lysaker, Norway-based Pronova said
Oct. 4 in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
