Movies and television shows may be
priced too high to deter piracy, according to a survey by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  People who admit to stealing movies and programs say they
are unwilling to pay more than $3 for films and $1 for TV shows,
the New York-based accounting firm that tabulates Oscar results
said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Aside from the traditional reason of price, leading
factors driving illegal consumption of film and television
content include consumers’ desire for earlier access, a
perception that ‘everyone is doing it’ and the proliferation of
free content available online,” the company said.  Film and TV companies including  Walt Disney Co . and  Time
Warner Inc ., the biggest producer of movies and prime-time
television shows, rent films on U.S. pay-TV systems for $4.99
each.  Apple Inc .’s iTunes rents TV shows from Disney’s ABC and  News Corp .’s Fox for $1.  PwC also found 81 percent of consumers who admit to
stealing films and shows say they’re unlikely to stop. Among
those, 40 percent say they will likely begin illegally acquiring
content on mobile devices in the next six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
