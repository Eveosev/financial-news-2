Treasuries rose as traders debated
the strength of the U.S. economic recovery after reports showed
retail sales rose less than analysts forecast and manufacturing
picked up in the  New York  region.  Treasury 10-year note yields fell to almost the lowest in
seven days as the  Federal Reserve  purchased $6.7 billion in
Treasuries as part of its plan to keep borrowings costs from
surging as the recovery gains traction. Treasury may sell $99
billion of notes next week, primary dealers said.  “We are solidly within a new trading range,” said
Christian Cooper, head of U.S. dollar derivatives trading in New
York at Jefferies & Co., one of the 20 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. “The market is waiting to take advantage of
higher rates and watching to see what direction the data
turns.”  The yield on the 10-year note fell two basis points to 3.6
percent at 5:04 p.m. in New York, according to BGCantor Market
Data, almost the lowest since Feb. 4. The 3.625 percent security
maturing in February 2021 rose 4/32 or $1.25 per $10,000 of face
value, to 100 5/32. It earlier reached as much as 3.66 percent.  Yield Swings  Two-year note yields gained as much as four basis points to
0.88 percent, the highest since May 13. Thirty-year bond yields
fell one basis point to 4.66 percent.  The Treasury may sell $35 billion in 2-year notes, $35
billion in 5-year debt and $29 billion in 7-year securities next
week, according to the forecasts of 14 primary dealers in a
Bloomberg News survey. The auction sizes have remained unchanged
since October. The amounts will be announced by the Treasury on
Feb. 17.  The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $9 billion in 30-
year inflation-indexed bonds on Feb. 17.  The Fed purchased Treasuries due from February 2015 to
August 2016 today as part of its plan to pump $600 billion into
the economy to spur growth. The central bank is buying U.S.
securities every day this week.  BNP Paribas said investors should bet the difference in
yield between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries will narrow as the
Fed will probably keep buying U.S. securities.  Curve Pressures  “Even though the long end of the curve might have some
pressure as we have good figures on growth, the Fed is going to
make sure it is not going too high,” Nicolas Chaput, Paris-
based chief investment officer, said in an interview in  Singapore  last week. “There might be pressure for the short end
to go up.”  The extra premium investors demand to hold 10-year  U.S.
debt  compared with 2-year notes, called the yield curve,
narrowed to 278 basis points from 289 basis points on Feb. 9.  The difference between yields on 2-year notes and 30-year
bonds narrowed to 383 basis points from a record 401 basis
points Feb. 1.  Total foreign purchases of Treasury notes and bonds were
$54.6 billion in December compared with purchases of $61.7
billion in November, rising to $4.37 trillion.  The Treasury holdings of China, the largest foreign lender
to the U.S., declined by $4 billion, or 0.5 percent, to $891.6
billion, while its holdings of longer-term notes and bonds rose
0.6 percent, or $5.4 billion, to a record $876.2 billion in
December, according to Treasury data. The drop in total holdings
came as  China  reduced its position in short-term Treasury bills
by $9.4 billion, or 38 percent, to $15.4 billion, the lowest
level since July.  Treasuries Holders  Treasury holdings by Japan, the second largest lender to
the U.S., rose $6.4 billion, or 0.7 percent, to $883.6 billion.  Bill holdings of overseas investors declined 7.4 percent to
$462.3 billion while positions in longer-term notes and bonds
rose 0.5 percent to $2.34 trillion.  Analysts said harsh winter weather influenced U.S. retail
sales that increased in January less than forecast. Sales
increased 0.3 percent, the smallest gain since a drop in June
and followed a 0.5 percent December gain that was less than
previously estimated, Commerce Department figures showed today
in  Washington . The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 0.5 percent rise.  Manufacturing in the New York region sped up during
February, a sign factories continue to drive the economic
expansion.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index rose to 15.4 from 11.9 in January. Economists projected an
increase to 15, based on the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The  consumer price index  in the U.S. rose 0.3 percent in
January after rising 0.5 percent the prior month, according to
the Bloomberg survey median ahead of the Feb. 17 report. So-
called core prices, which exclude food and fuel, were likely up
0.9 percent on an annual basis.  “We have been getting close to the point that would signal
the next move lower in Treasuries, but the economic data just
hasn’t confirmed the move yet,” said  Sean Murphy , Treasury
trader in New York at Societe Generale, a primary dealer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
