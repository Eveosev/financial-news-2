Donbass Fuel & Energy Co., Ukraine’s
largest non-state coal and power producer, increased coal output
by 8.7 percent in 2010 after upgrading its equipment.  The switch to efficient mining equipment and innovative
know-how was a key reason for the production increase, Donbass
Fuel, or DTEK, said in an e-mailed statement today. DTEK’s
Pavlogradugol and Komsomolets Donbassa mine companies produced a
total of 19.2 million metric tons of coal last year, according
to the statement.  The mines achieved the highest production in DTEK’s
history: 15 million tons at Pavlogradugol and 4 million at
Komsomolets Donbassa. Production of thermal coal by the two
companies increased by 17.2 percent to 17.1 million tons. Coking
coal output declined by 32.7 percent to 2.03 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
