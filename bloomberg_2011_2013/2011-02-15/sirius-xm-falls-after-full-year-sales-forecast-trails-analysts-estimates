  Sirius XM Radio Inc ., the satellite-
radio broadcaster, dropped 7.9 percent in Nasdaq trading after
reporting a fourth-quarter loss and forecasting full-year sales
that trailed analystsâ€™ estimates.  Sirius XM fell 15 cents to $1.69 at 4 p.m. New York time.
The shares almost tripled last year.  Revenue for 2011 will be $3 billion, New York-based Sirius
XM said today in a statement. Analysts had projected $3.09
billion, the average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sirius XM, home to  Howard Stern , posted a fourth-quarter
loss of $81.4 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with a
profit $11.8 million, or break even, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
