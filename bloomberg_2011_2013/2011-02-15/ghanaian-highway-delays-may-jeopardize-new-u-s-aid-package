Delays in building a U.S.-funded
highway in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, may jeopardize a new  aid
package  from the U.S., a senior Ghanaian official said.  Squatters have refused to move from a  14-kilometer section 
of the N1 highway, which links Accra with the ports of Tema and
Takoradi, meaning the $126 million project may miss a completion
deadline of February 2012, said Martin Eson-Benjamin, chief
executive officer of  Ghana ’s Millennium Development Authority.  If the people don’t move “there is a good chance that the
road may not be finished and the difficulty may be that the
Americans may not be able to look favorably at us for a second
compact,” Eson-Benjamin told reporters in Accra. “We are
praying for everybody not to put any impediment in the way.”  The road project is part of a $547 million aid package from
the U.S. government’s Millennium Development Authority, which is
also funding other road, agriculture and rural development
projects. The board of the Washington-based agency said Jan. 5
Ghana was  eligible  to apply for new aid funds upon “successful
completion of first compacts,” according to a statement on its
website.  The highway is being built by China Railway Wuju Corp. and  Portugal ’s  MSF Construction .  The government has already paid $11 million to business-
owners and residents in the road’s path, some of whom have
refused to move, Eson-Benjamin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
