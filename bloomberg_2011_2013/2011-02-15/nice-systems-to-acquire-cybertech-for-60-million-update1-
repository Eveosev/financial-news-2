  Nice Systems Ltd . said its purchase
of  CyberTech International , a global provider of compliance
recording solutions, for about $60 million in cash, will boost
non-GAAP revenue by about $25 million in 2011.  Separately, the Israeli maker of digital-recording
surveillance products said fourth-quarter adjusted net income
was $32.7 million, or 51 cents a share, 13 percent higher than a
year earlier. It beat the 49 cents a share mean estimate of two
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The CyberTech acquisition helps fill a market gap for
Ra’anana-based Nice, Chief Financial Officer Dafna Gruber said.  “CyberTech is very focused on the lower-end of the market,
on small to medium-sized businesses,” Gruber said in a phone
interview, “By joining forces we are expanding our product
offering and expanding our addressable market, and making a very
significant consolidation because CyberTech was a very strong
player in this area.”  Nice rose 0.9 percent to 127.70 shekels at the 4:30 p.m.
