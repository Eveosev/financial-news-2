  Citigroup Inc ., the third-largest
U.S. bank, has hired investment banker Thomas Woodley Heath III,
formerly of UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co., as a managing
director of its North American financial institution group.  Heath will report to David Head and Peter Babej, the co-
heads of the bank’s so-called FIG team. Heath will be
responsible for “leading the coverage effort for U.S. banks,”
according to an internal memorandum obtained by Bloomberg News,
the contents of which were confirmed by spokesman Mark
Costiglio.  Citigroup, based in New York, is trying to revamp its
investment bank after fees from advising on mergers and
acquisitions, as well as managing equity and debt offerings,
fell 20 percent to $3.83 billion last year. The bank slipped to
fifth place from second among underwriters of global corporate
bonds in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Tom brings outstanding experience providing sophisticated
advice and capital raising experience to banks throughout the
U.S., and will be instrumental in growing our franchise in this
area,” according to the memo, which is dated Jan. 13.  The hiring was reported earlier today on TheStreet.com.  Heath joined JPMorgan in 1992 and UBS in 2007. That year,
he was fined $100,000 and censured by the  New York  Stock
Exchange for allegedly disclosing material information about a
pending takeover in 2005 to Bank of America Corp., which
officials said he was hoping to join at the time. Costiglio
declined to comment on the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
