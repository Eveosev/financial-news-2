The dollar dropped against 14 of its
16 most-traded counterparts after U.S. builders began work on
more homes at an annualized rate in January than forecast and
manufacturing rose, fueling demand for higher-yielding assets.  The pound slid against all of its major peers after  Bank of
England  Governor  Mervyn King  said inflation will peak this year
and ease in 2012, damping speculation interest rates will rise.
The Swiss franc gained versus the dollar after  Israel  said two
Iranian warships plan to sail through the Suez Canal today and
called the move a “provocation.” Stocks rose.  “The market seems to like this data, and the equity market
and the euro are going up,” said  Brian Taylor , chief currency
trader at Manufacturers & Traders Trust Co. in Buffalo, New
York. “People want to be a little riskier.”  The dollar fell 0.6 percent to $1.3569 at 5 p.m. in New
York, after earlier losing as much as 0.8 percent and gaining
0.2 percent. The yen rose 0.1 percent to 83.68 per dollar, from
83.77 yesterday. The Japanese currency depreciated 0.5 percent
to 113.55 per euro after earlier touching 113.64, the weakest
level since Jan. 28.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent.  The greenback remained lower versus most peers as minutes
released today of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s January meeting
showed policy makers took a more optimistic view of the  U.S.
economy  while maintaining their dissatisfaction with job growth
as they pressed forward with monetary stimulus.  Norwegian Krone  Norway’s krone rose against all of its 16 most-traded peers
as crude oil for March delivery jumped as much as 1.9 percent to
$85.95 a barrel in New York. The nation is a major oil producer.
The krone appreciated 1.7 percent to 5.7257 per dollar.  The yen initially fell versus the dollar after U.S. home
starts increased 15 percent to an annualized rate of 596,000
last month, according to Commerce Department data. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a rate of 539,000.  Manufacturing rose 0.3 percent in January, data from the  Federal Reserve  showed. Overall industrial production
unexpectedly declined 0.1 percent as utilities, which had a
decline in demand because of milder temperatures, and mining
fell, the figures showed.    Canada ’s dollar gained for the first time in three days
against the greenback as crude oil, the nation’s biggest export,
rose. The currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 98.50 cents per
U.S. dollar, from 98.98 yesterday, and touched 98.46 cents, the
strongest level since Feb. 4.  The  Mexican peso  also rose for the first time in three
days, gaining 0.7 percent to 12.0734 per U.S. dollar.  Mexico ,
like Canada, counts the U.S. as its biggest trade partner.  ‘Better Than Expected’  “The peso depends very much on data out of the U.S.,”
said  Rafael Camarena , an economist with Banco Santander SA in
Mexico City. “Housing starts came out much better than
expected.”  The Swiss currency, considered a haven, gained 0.8 percent
to 95.95 centimes per dollar after Israeli Foreign Minister  Avigdor Lieberman  condemned a canal transit by Iranian naval
vessels. The franc rose 0.2 percent against the euro to 1.3018
after earlier gaining as much as 0.5 percent.    South Africa ’s rand was the second-best performer against
the  U.S. dollar . It climbed 1.1 percent to 7.2545 per dollar.  The pound was the worst performer, declining 0.2 percent to
$1.6093 after King told reporters in London policy makers
anticipate “the chances of inflation being above or below the
target are broadly equal.” Accelerating prices had spurred
speculation the central bank will have to raise borrowing costs.  U.K. Jobless Claims  The BOE said its forecast is for inflation to peak at about
4.4 percent this year before easing to the 2 percent goal by the
middle of 2012, and undershoot the target within two years.
British unemployment-benefit claims unexpectedly rose in
January, a report today showed.  Sterling weakened 0.8 percent to 84.30 pence per euro.  Fed policy makers were divided over whether further
evidence of a quickening recovery would warrant slowing or
reducing a stimulus program to buy $600 billion of Treasuries,
minutes of the Jan. 25-26 meeting of the  Federal Open Market
Committee  showed.  The dollar has fallen 2.8 percent over the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indexes, a measure of 10 developed-nation currencies. The
Canadian currency has gained 1.3 percent. President  Barack Obama 
sent Congress a $3.7 trillion budget this week that projects the
federal deficit will exceed $1 trillion for the fourth
consecutive year.  Liberty Mutual Holding Co., the second-largest
policyholder-owned property-casualty insurer in the U.S., is
expanding abroad and shortening the duration of bond holdings
because deficit spending and Fed policies may weaken the dollar.  “We are firmly convinced, and have been for a couple of
years, that the monetary and fiscal policy will continue to
debase the dollar,” Liberty Mutual Chief Executive Officer
Edmund “Ted” Kelly said in a conference call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
