  Alberto Contador , who failed a drug
test in July while winning the  Tour de France  for a third time,
was cleared of doping, his lawyer Andy Ramos said.  The Spanish cycling federation canceled its Jan. 26
proposal for a one-year ban for the rider after considering
final arguments, Ramos said by telephone.  Cycling ruling body  Union Cycliste Internationale  and the
World Anti-Doping Agency can appeal the verdict to the Lausanne,
Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport. Contador,
suspended since September, can return to competition even if
there is an ongoing appeal.  “This is very surprising,” Brian Cookson, a British
member of cycling ruling  body Union Cycliste Internationale’s
management committee, said in a phone interview. “If any amount
of clenbuterol is present that’s an offense. I’m puzzled to
understand the Spanish federation’s interpretation of the
situation.”  UCI said today in an e-mailed statement that it was
considering an appeal, and has 30 days from receiving documents
from the Spanish federation to lodge a protest.  Television Espanola reported that the Spaniard will
participate in a race in  Portugal  that starts tomorrow.  Contador blamed eating contaminated beef for testing
positive for the banned stimulant clenbuterol on the last rest
day of the 2010 Tour de  France . The test found he had 50
picograms per milliliter of clenbuterol in his body. A picogram
is one trillionth of a gram.  To contact the reporter on this story:
