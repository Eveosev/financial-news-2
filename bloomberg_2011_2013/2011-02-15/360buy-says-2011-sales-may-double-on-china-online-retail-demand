360buy Jingdong Mall , a Beijing-
based online retailer, said it expects sales to more than double
this year amid increasing popularity of electronic commerce in
the world’s largest Internet market.  360buy, which sells products from home appliances to books
to more than 15 million users in  China , may have sales of as
much as 26 billion yuan ($3.9 billion) this year, compared with
10 billion yuan in 2010,  Li Jing, a company spokeswoman, said
in an e-mail today. The closely held company was founded by Liu
Qiangdong in 2004.  Sales in China’s online retail industry reached 520 billion
yuan in 2010, more than doubling from a year earlier, according
to a  report  by Chinese research firm Analysys International
yesterday.  China had 457 million  Internet users  at the end of last
year, according to the government-affiliated China Internet
Network Information Center. That’s more than the combined
populations of the U.S. and Japan.  --Michael Wei. Editors: Vipin Nair, Chua Kong Ho  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:  Michael Wei  in Beijing at
