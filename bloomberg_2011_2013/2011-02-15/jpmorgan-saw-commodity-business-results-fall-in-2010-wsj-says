  JPMorgan Chase & Co . is among banks
who saw revenue from their commodity businesses, such as gold,
copper and cotton, decline last year, the Wall Street Journal
said, citing people with knowledge of the results.  JPMorgan commodity revenue sliped 43 percent when compared
with results in 2009, the Journal said.  The performance wasnâ€™t disclosed in company earnings
reports because commodity business results include currencies
and bonds, the newspaper said.  A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment, the Journal
said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
