  LyondellBasell Industries NV  began
planned maintenance at the La Porte chemical plant in  Texas ,
according to a message left on a community hot line.  An olefins unit was shut down “due to a loss of steam,”
the Netherlands-based company said today in a  filing  with the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Flaring started
yesterday at 8 p.m. local time and was expected to last until
Feb. 18 at the same time, according to the filing.  Lyondell also had flaring at the Channelview chemical plant
because of “operating conditions in a process unit,” the
company said in a separate message left on the hot line.    David Harpole , a Lyondell spokesman based in Houston,
declined to comment on “daily operations” at the facilities.  Chemical plant outages can increase prices for products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts.  There are two olefins units at the Channelview complex,
each with a capacity of 1.95 billion pounds a year, Harpole has
said. The La Porte plant also has an ethylene cracker, according
to the spokesman.  The Channelview complex is about 20 miles (32 kilometers)
east of downtown Houston and the La Porte complex is 25 miles
southeast of the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
