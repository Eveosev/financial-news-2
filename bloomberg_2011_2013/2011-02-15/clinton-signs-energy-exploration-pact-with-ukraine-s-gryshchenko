Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kostyantyn Gryshchenko today
signed an agreement that would allow the  U.S. Geological Survey 
assess potential energy resources in the Ukraine, including
shale gas.  The ceremony in  Washington  before officials from both
countries began the third meeting of the U.S.-Ukraine Strategic
Partnership Commission. It also included the signing of an
agreement to work against human trafficking in the Ukraine.  “We have sought to use our partnership commission to plan
and implement concrete action that improves the life for both of
our peoples,” Clinton said at the ceremony.  Today’s discussions also include increased cooperation on
nuclear security and nonproliferation. The U.S. helped Ukraine
remove more than 100 kilograms of highly enriched uranium from
multiple locations last year, advancing President  Barack Obama ’s
goal of securing nuclear materials worldwide.  The meeting will also cover democracy and the rule of law,
enhancing the Ukrainian investment climate, economic reform,
trade, investment, science and technology.  Clinton and Gryshchenko will also meet with civil society
groups from Ukraine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
