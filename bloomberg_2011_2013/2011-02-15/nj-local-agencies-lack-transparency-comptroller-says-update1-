  New Jersey ’s 587 local authorities
and commissions lack transparency and many fail to take basic
steps to keep the public informed of their operations and
finances, the State Comptroller’s office said in a report.  Only 3 percent of the government entities post their
financial reports on the Internet, and more than a third don’t
operate a website, according to the report.  The local agencies include improvement, sewerage and
pollution-control authorities as well as fire districts and
bridge commissions. New Jersey averages one government unit for
every 3.8 square miles, according to the report.  “For too long, many local authorities and commissions in
New Jersey have acted like private clubs, publicizing agency
information only when it suits their needs,” said Comptroller
Matthew Boxer in a press release.  Boxer introduced a “transparency portal”  website  that
offers access to the more than 1,900 government agencies,
including the 587 local authorities and commissions, operating
in the state. To improve transparency, the report recommended
all local agencies establish a website that displays financial
information, a description of the agency’s mission, contact
information and a schedule of its agenda.  Total debt and expenditures for the 587 local authorities
each exceeds $5 billion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
