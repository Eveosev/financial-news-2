OAO Surgutneftegas,  Russia ’s fourth
largest oil producer, plans to increase output by about 1.9
percent this year to 60.7 million metric tons of oil (1.22
million barrels a day).  Projects in East Siberia will produce 5.4 million tons, the
Surgut-based company said today in a  statement  on its website.  Surgutneftegas’s production fell 0.1 percent last year to
59.55 million tons, according to the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK
data unit. That matches previous company guidance.  The company plans to refine 21.3 million tons this year,
according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
