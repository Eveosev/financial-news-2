  Vietnam ’s dong gained as the
country’s central bank strengthened its reference rate for
today’s trading.  The dong traded at 20,860 per dollar as of 4 p.m. at banks
in Hanoi, compared with 20,900 at the close of trading
yesterday, according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The State Bank of Vietnam fixed the daily reference rate at
20,703 today, versus 20,713 yesterday, according to its  Web
site . The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either
side of the set rate.  The central bank devalued the dong by about 7 percent on
Feb. 11, by setting the reference rate at 20,693 versus 18,932
the previous day, in an attempt to curb the nation’s trade
deficit and narrow the gap between official rate and the so-
called black market exchange rates. The trading band for the
currency was also narrowed to 1 percent on either side of the
rate, from 3 percent previously, according to the bank’s
website.  The  State Bank  “will manage the dong’s exchange rates
flexibly in both directions, with strengthening and weakening
rates, suiting the money market’s supplies and demand,” central
bank Governor Nguyen Van Giau said last week. Vietnam’s banks
have “plentiful” foreign exchange, Giau said in a statement.  The dong slid in the unofficial market, trading as low as
21,750 as of 4 p.m. at gold shops in Hanoi, compared with 21,700
yesterday, according to a telephone directory information
service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts & Telecommunications.    Government bonds  fell for the first time in four days, with
the yield on the benchmark five-year note climbing three basis
points to 11.50 percent, according to a daily fixing price from
about 10 banks compiled by Bloomberg.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editor: Sandy Hendry  To contact the reporter on this story:
