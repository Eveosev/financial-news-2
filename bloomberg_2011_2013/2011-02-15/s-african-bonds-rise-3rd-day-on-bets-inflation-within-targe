South African bonds rose for a third
day before a report tomorrow that is expected to show inflation
stayed within the central bank’s target band for a 12th month,
giving it room to leave  interest rates  at a record low.  The 13.5 percent security due September 2015 added 6 cents
to 121.49 rand, lowering the yield by 2 basis points to 7.82
percent at 6 p.m. in Johannesburg. The 10.5 percent bond due
December 2026 climbed 15 cents to 115.68 rand, while the yield
dropped 2 basis points to 8.66 percent.  “At current levels adjusted for both risk and inflation,
domestic bonds should hold some attraction to foreigners,”
Tradition Analytics analysts led by Quinten Bertenshaw in
Johannesburg wrote in a client note today.  Inflation in  Africa ’s biggest economy probably quickened to
3.7 percent in January, from 3.5 percent in December, according
to the median estimate of 20 economists polled by Bloomberg.
That’s still below the 6 percent upper limit of the central
bank’s target band.    South Africa ’s central bank has lowered its main interest
rate nine times since December 2008 to a record low of 5.5
percent as a 42 percent surge in the rand over the previous two
years helped reduce the cost of oil and other imports. Central
bank Governor Gill Marcus said the rate is expected to remain
“relatively stable for some time,” following a unanimous
decision by the monetary policy committee to leave it unchanged
on Jan. 20.  The rand traded little changed at 7.3047 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
