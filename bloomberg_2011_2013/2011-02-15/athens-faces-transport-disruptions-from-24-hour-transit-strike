  Athens  commuters face traffic chaos
as transit workers hold a 24-hour strike to protest a bill
before parliament to restructure state-run transport companies.  The  Athens metro , used by 620,000 passengers daily, along
with city buses, trams and trolleys won’t operate, forcing
commuters to stay home or find alternative transportation. The
electric railway service, which runs from the port city of
Piraeus to the northern Athens suburb of Kifisia, will also be
shut, according to a statement on the  Athens Urban
Transportation Organization  website.  The bill includes mergers of transit agencies, increased
monitoring on spending and the involuntary transfer of transit
employees. The proposals are part of an effort to cut spending
at state-run companies to meet the terms of a 110 billion-euro
($148 billion) bailout from the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund .  In December,  Greece ’s parliament approved a 10 percent wage
cut for employees at state-run companies who earn more than
1,800 euros per month along with a monthly wage cap of 4,000
euros. The 11 most unprofitable state companies had combined
sales of 1.5 billion euros in 2009 and losses of 1.7 billion
euros, according to government data.  Transit workers have held a series of strikes and work
stoppages since Dec. 8. Public transit unions also plan to hold
a rally in central Athens before marching to parliament this
afternoon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
