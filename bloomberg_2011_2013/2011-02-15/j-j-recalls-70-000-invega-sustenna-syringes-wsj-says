  Johnson & Johnson  recalled about
70,000 syringes of the antipsychotic drug Invega after finding
cracks in the syringes, which could cause infections or reduced
efficacy in users, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a
company website.  The recalled syringes, filled with 234-milligram dosages of
Invega Sustenna, were distributed beginning in March 2010, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
