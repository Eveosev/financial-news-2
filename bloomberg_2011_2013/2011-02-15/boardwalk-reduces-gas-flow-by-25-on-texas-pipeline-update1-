Gulf South Pipeline Co., a unit of  Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP , reduced gas flows through a line
in  Texas  after a fire in a compressor station, said Allison McLean, a Boardwalk spokeswoman in Houston.  The fire “did reduce flows, but only by about 25
percent,” McLean said in a telephone interview today. “We are
flowing at about 1 billion cubic feet a day."  The fire occurred at 9:40 p.m. local time yesterday in
Panola County, Texas, according to a  filing  to the National
Response Center. McLean said the fire is being investigated.  Boardwalk owns and operates more than 14,000 miles (22,526
kilometers) of pipelines in 12 states, according to the company
 website .
