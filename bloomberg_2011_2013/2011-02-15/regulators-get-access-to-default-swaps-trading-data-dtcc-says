Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.,
operator of a global registry for credit-default swaps, said
itâ€™s providing customized trade data to 19 global regulators.  The reports allow market supervisors and central banks to
monitor the aggregate positions and counterparties of regulated
firms within their jurisdiction, the New York-based company said
in a statement.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
