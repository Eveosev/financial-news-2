Cyprus’s economy is likely to grow
between 1.5 percent and 2 percent this year as a “gradual”
recovery continues, an  International Monetary Fund  official said
today.  Prospects for a continued upturn in 2012 are also
“favorable,” Wes McGrew, IMF deputy division chief at the
organization’s European department, told reporters in Nicosia.  The Cypriot economy grew 0.9 percent in 2010 after
shrinking 1.7 percent in 2009, according to initial estimates,
the  Cyprus Statistical Service  said today.  While bad loans at Cypriot banks have increased, “the rate
of increase seems to be stabilizing” and unless problems
intensify, such as a renewed sharp drop in real estate prices,
“the impact on the banking sector will be manageable,” McGrew
said.  The share of non-performing loans, excluding fully
collateralized loans, rose to 8.5 percent in September 2010 from
7.9 percent in March, the  Central Bank of Cyprus  said Dec. 10.
The central bank forecasts home prices to have dropped an annual
3 percent in 2010.  The loan portfolio of Cyprus’s banks in  Greece  “is a
relatively conservative one” and the Cyprus central bank has
carried out “rigorous stress testing,” which showed that there
are strong buffers in place, McGrew said.  Cyprus banks are unlikely to require fiscal support and any
problems would be related to liquidity rather than solvency, he
said. The  European Central Bank  would have several ways to
provide liquidity, McGrew added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
