Palladium and steel will probably
outperform other metals on gains in emerging markets and the
auto industry, Tellurian Capital Management LLP said.  “Palladium and steel will be the big winners,” Jean-Marc Bonnefous, a managing partner at Tellurian, told the JetFin
Commo 2011 conference in Geneva. Tellurian also recommends
buying coal and iron ore as a “recovery play,” as well as
freight, he said.  Zinc will underperform metals because “there is a lot of
zinc around,” Bonnefous said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
