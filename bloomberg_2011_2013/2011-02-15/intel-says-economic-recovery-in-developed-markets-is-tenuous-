  Intel Corp . Chief Financial Officer
Stacy Smith said the economic recovery in developed countries
remains “tenuous.”  Smith made the remarks at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
investment conference in San Francisco. Intel, based in  Santa
Clara ,  California , is the world’s biggest maker of computer
chips.  “I’m a bit worried about the tenuous nature of the
macroeconomic recovery in developed markets,” Smith said. He
didn’t specify what countries he was referring to.  Last month, the company said it expects sales to increase
10 percent this year from a record in 2010. Demand for chips
used in server computers, needed to supply data for the growing
number of smartphones and tablets connected to the Internet, is
helping to drive growth.  Smith also said Intel will have a “very strong” position
in tablet computers and make inroads into the smartphone market
in 2011.  The company has struggled to recruit mobile-phone makers to
become customers for its scaled-down PC chips. Smith said
Intel’s newest model, Medfield, is capable of working off as
little power as those from rivals that use technology from ARM
Holdings Plc. Medfield is twice as fast, he said.  Intel fell 12 cents to $21.45 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have climbed 2 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
