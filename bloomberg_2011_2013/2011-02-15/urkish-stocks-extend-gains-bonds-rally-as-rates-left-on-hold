Turkish stocks and bonds rallied
after the central bank left its key interest rate unchanged.  The main  ISE National 100 Index  climbed 233.3 or 0.4
percent, to 64,802.14, the highest since Feb. 9, at the 5:30
p.m. close in Istanbul. The yield on two-year bonds dropped 4
basis points to its lowest in almost two weeks to 8.34 percent,
according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index. The lira was
little changed at 1.5960 against the dollar, after losing and
gaining as much as 0.5 percent in earlier trading today.  “This is a market friendly decision,” Suha Yaygin, deputy
chief of emerging markets at Toronto-Dominion Bank in  London ,
wrote in e-mailed comments today. “The pressure on bonds will
be lifted.”  The bank in Ankara kept its one-week repo lending rate at a
record low of 6.25 percent. Six of seven economists surveyed by
Bloomberg this week had predicted no change.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
