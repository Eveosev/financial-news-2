Former and current  Deutsche Telekom
AG  and Volkswagen AG managers and employees are being probed by
Stuttgart prosecutors over bribery allegations, Sueddeutsche

Telekom’s T-Systems unit tried to get orders from Volkswagen in
exchange for continuing a sponsorship with soccer club VfL
Wolfsburg, the newspaper said. Volkswagen is based in Wolfsburg,  Germany .  Volkswagen spokesman Michael Brendel said the company is
cooperating with prosecutors and is also conducting its own
investigation. He declined to comment on whether Volkswagen
managers are being probed.  T-Systems’ press office didn’t immediately return a call
seeking comment. Stuttgart prosecutors also didn’t answer
several calls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
