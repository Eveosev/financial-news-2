Zambia Electricity Supply Corp., or
Zesco, will spend $420 million boosting electricity production
from its Kariba hydro plant by 360 megawatts, the  Daily Mail 
reported, citing Managing Director Ernest Mupwaya.  The Export-Import Bank of China has provided a $315 million
loan for the project, while a further $105.5 million was
borrowed from the  Development Bank  of Southern Africa Ltd., the
Lusaka-based newspaper said. China Hydro Corp. will upgrade the
power plant before 2012, the  Daily Mail  said.  State-owned Zesco currently  generates about 600 megawatts 
from its Kariba North generators, according to the companyâ€™s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
