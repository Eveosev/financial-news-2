Turkish police started an
investigation after a group of protestors threatened to remove a
cross from the roof of a church in the northeastern city of
Trabzon on Jan. 1, Vatan reported.  The group left a note attached to a Molotov cocktail in the
grounds of the church saying they would take down the cross
unless it was removed by the priest, the Istanbul-based
newspaper said.   The churchâ€™s former priest Andrea Santoro was shot dead by
a 16-year-old boy in February 2006. A German missionary and two
Turks publishing Christian literature in central  Turkey  were
tortured and killed in 2007.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
