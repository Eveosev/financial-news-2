Oil options volatility slipped as
the underlying futures tumbled to the lowest price in 11 weeks
and as gasoline futures dropped on U.S. supply forecasts.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.1 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 28.3 percent yesterday.  Oil for March delivery fell 49 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $84.32 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the lowest level since Nov. 30. Futures have risen 14 percent in
the past year.  Gasoline for March delivery dropped 2.86 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.4888 a gallon on the Nymex as analysts predicted
that gasoline inventories rose for the seventh straight week.  March $86 calls were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 3,415 lots changing hands. They dropped 34
cents to 8 cents a barrel. March $83 puts, the next-most active
contract, fell 12 cents to 15 cents a barrel with 3,135
contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  March options expire at the close of Nymex floor trading
tomorrow.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  March $84 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 9,395 lots changing hands. They gained 8 cents
to 52 cents a barrel. The next-most active option, March $85
puts, increased 17 cents to 94 cents a barrel on 9,307
contracts.  Open interest was highest for April $100 calls with 43,807
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 40,254 and March
$100 calls with 39,773.  To contact the reporter on this story:
