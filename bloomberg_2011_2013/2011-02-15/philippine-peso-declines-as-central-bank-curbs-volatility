The Philippine peso dropped, erasing
earlier gains, on speculation the central bank bought dollars to
curb the local currency’s strength. Bonds were steady.  Money sent home by the more than 8 million Filipinos living
overseas climbed 8.1 percent in December to $1.69 billion from a
year earlier, a report today showed. The peso is the second-best
performer among  Asia ’s 10 most-actively traded currencies
excluding the yen this month.  “The central bank may be trying to manage volatility,”
Marcelo Ayes, a Manila-based senior vice president at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. Remittances will keep “supporting the
peso as they provide adequate dollar supply in the market,” he
added.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to close at 43.69 per dollar in
Manila, after earlier gaining as much as 0.2 percent, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency has strengthened 1.4 percent
this month, a performance second only to  Indonesia ’s rupiah in
the region.  Remittances totaled $18.8 billion in 2010, making them the
second-largest source of foreign exchange, after exports.  The yield on the 7 percent bond due January 2016 was 6.25
percent, the highest level since Jan. 21, according to Tradition
Financial Services. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The government sold 3 billion pesos ($69 million) of 25-
year bonds at an average yield of 8.140 percent, according to
the Bureau of the Treasury. That compares with a yield of 7.925
percent during the last auction of similar-dated debt in
September. Bids totaled 10.36 billion pesos.  To contact the reporter for this story:
