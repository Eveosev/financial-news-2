  Danone , the world’s biggest yogurt
maker, may purchase smaller companies to expand in medical
nutrition and water, Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Andre Terisse said.  “There may be some acquisitions” in medical nutrition, he
said in an interview in Paris after the company reported an 18
percent increase in 2010 profit. The bulk of the unit’s growth
will come from existing businesses.  Danone also might make a “small” purchase in bottled
water, Terisse said. The Evian bottler may expand existing water
brands into new markets as it did by introducing the Mexican
Bonafont brand to  Brazil .  The French maker of Activia yogurt got 6 percent of its
sales last year from medical nutrition and 17 percent from
bottled water. Danone is also planning to add fresh fruit
products to its ranges as part of a joint venture with  Chiquita
Brands International Inc ., Terisse said.  “We think a bit wider than the pure use of milk or the
pure use of water,” the CFO said, adding that Danone has
introduced flavored waters and an energy drink in  Asia  called
Mizone. Danone and Chiquita are testing the fruit products in
Belgium and soon will start a trial in  Germany , he said.  Danone might also start selling other products linked to
Qua, an Indian water brand the company recently acquired that
bottles water from the Himalayas, Terisse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
