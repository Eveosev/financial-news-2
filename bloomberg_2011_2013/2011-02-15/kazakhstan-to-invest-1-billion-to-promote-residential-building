Kazakhstan, the biggest energy
producer in central  Asia , plans to invest 150 billion tenge ($1
billion) through 2012 to spur residential construction.  The government will spend 40 billion tenge to build
infrastructure needed for new development, Serik Nokin, head of
the state housing agency, said during a Cabinet meeting in the
capital Astana today.  Forty-one billion tenge will be provided to local
authorities for the construction of public housing, Nokin said
at the meeting in a  broadcast  posted on the website of Prime
Minister Karim Masimov.  The remaining money will be deposited in commercial banks,
which will provide mortgages to buyers of low-cost homes. The
initiative will contribute to building 6 million square meters
of residential property a year, Nokin said.  Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, 70, last month
called snap elections for April and scrapped a referendum on
extending his 22-year rule. The government must spent 75 billion
tenge this year to boost residential building, Nazarbayev said
in a Feb. 11  speech  to his ruling Nur Otan Party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
