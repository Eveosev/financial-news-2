  Bolivia ’s central bank strengthened
the national currency for the fifth time since November.  The central bank revalued the currency to 7.02 bolivianos
per dollar from 7.03 bolivianos per dollar, according to the
central bank’s website. Bolivia uses a so-called crawling peg,
which consists of moving the currency’s peg to the dollar in
small increments.
