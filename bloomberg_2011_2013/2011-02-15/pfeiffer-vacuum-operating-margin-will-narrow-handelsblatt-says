  Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology AG , the
German maker of vacuum pumps, expects profitability to worsen
this year and sales to rise at a faster pace on the long-term,
 Handelsblatt  reported today, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Manfred Bender.  The operating margin will be below 20 percent after
Pfeifferâ€™s acquisition of French competitor Adixen, the
newspaper said. Sales increase will return to a pace comparable
to the average 7 percent annual growth in the past, Handelsblatt
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
