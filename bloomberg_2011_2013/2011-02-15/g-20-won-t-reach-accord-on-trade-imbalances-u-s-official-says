Group of 20 officials are unlikely
to reach agreement on a set of guidelines for monitoring trade
imbalances when they meet in Paris this week, a U.S. Treasury
official told reporters in Washington today.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  is scheduled to
leave tomorrow for two days of meetings with other G-20 finance
ministers and central bankers. French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said yesterday that the meetings would aim for “a
common diagnosis” on ways to identify imbalances and their
causes.  It’s probably too early for such an agreement to come into
focus, the U.S. official said today in a press briefing on
condition of not being named. The official said the U.S. also
would continue to support a G-20 push for global adjustment.    China ’s currency remains undervalued and needs to continue
to rise, the U.S. official said. Brazil, in contrast, may have
an overvalued currency because its markets are more open to
investors, which creates a challenge for its policy makers.  The U.S. believes all major nations should allow their
exchange rates to adjust to market forces, the official said.
The official also said the U.S. is pursuing a middle ground of
fiscal discipline and spending to encourage growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Rebecca Christie  in Washington at
