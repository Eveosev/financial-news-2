Turkish stocks and bonds rallied
after the central bank left its key interest rate unchanged.  The main  ISE National 100 Index  climbed 692.8 or 1.1
percent, to 65,261.7 at 2:23 p.m. in Istanbul. The yield on two-
year bonds dropped 9 basis points to 8.29 percent, according to
a Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc index. The lira strengthened
0.4 percent to 1.5880 against the dollar, after losing as much
as 0.5 percent in earlier trading today.  “This is a market friendly decision,” Suha Yaygin, deputy
chief of emerging markets at Toronto-Dominion Bank in  London ,
wrote in e-mailed comments today. “The pressure on bonds will
be lifted.”  The bank in Ankara kept its one-week repo lending rate at a
record low of 6.25 percent. Six of seven economists surveyed by
Bloomberg this week had predicted no change.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
