  Rwanda  received expressions of
interest from at least four Indian companies for five tea
plantations being sold by the government, the  Rwanda Development
Board  said.  The sale of the farms, estimated to be worth 6.6 billion
Rwandan francs ($11 million), is part of a program to sell
state-owned assets to private investors, Daniel Ufitikirezi,
head of asset and business management at the Kigali-based board,
said in an interview yesterday. The plantations cover about
2,316 hectares (5,723 acres), according to the board.  “We have received expressions of interest from at least
four companies from India,” Ufitikirezi said, without naming
them. “Seven tea companies have already been privatized, and
they are fully operational.”  Tea is Rwanda’s second-biggest export crop, after coffee.
The East African nation plans to boost earnings from shipments
to $90 million by 2015, according to the country’s development
board.  Rwanda’s government will hand over Gisovu Tea Co. to U.K.-
based Boreli Tea Holdings Ltd. and McLeod Russell  India  Ltd.,
the  New Times  reported on Feb. 14 citing Rwanda’s Cabinet.
Boreli paid $2.75 million for 75 percent of the company, which
produces about 1.7 million kilograms (3.75 million pounds) of
tea annually, the Kigali-based newspaper said.  Rwanda is rebuilding its economy after the nation suffered
a genocide that left 800,000 people dead following a 100-day
slaughter in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
