  Equatorial Guinea  will export four
cargoes of Zafiro crude in April, unchanged from March,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will also ship four cargoes of Ceiba grade in
April, one more than March, the schedule showed. The shipments
are for 1 million barrels each.  Equatorial Guinea produced 307,000 barrels a day of oil in
2009, according to BP Plcâ€™s Statistical Review of World Energy.  Zafiro blend consists of oil from the Zafiro, Jade, Opalo,
Sausage and Serpentira fields off Equatorial Guinea on the West
African coast. The crude is produced jointly by Exxon Mobil
Corp., Ocean Equatorial Guinea Corp. and the government of
Equatorial Guinea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
