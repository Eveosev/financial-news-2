Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak’s
resignation and transfer of power to the military is likely to
prolong uncertainty in the region until the end of the year,
according to Tel Aviv-based Harel Insurance Investments and
Financial Services Ltd.  Mubarak stepped down on Feb. 11, bowing to the demands of
protesters who occupied Tahrir Square in central Cairo for
almost three weeks. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces
pledged to honor all international and regional treaties signed
by the North African nation.  Egypt  was the first Arab country to
agree to a peace accord with  Israel  in 1979.  “From Israel’s perspective, there are two key questions,”  Michael Sarel , chief economist at Harel, wrote in a report
released today. “Whether there will be moderate parties in
control, committed to democracy and peace agreements with
Israel, or a radical Islamic regime.”  Equally uncertain was how events in Egypt might influence
other countries in the region, Sarel said.  The shekel has declined 3.5 percent since the start of the
year amid the unrest in Egypt and as the Bank of Israel
introduced new foreign currency trading rules. It was little
changed today at 3.6540 per dollar. The yield on the Mimshal
Shiklit bond due February 2020 declined 1 basis point to 5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
