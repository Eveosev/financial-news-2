  Iberdrola SA  and the Basque regional
government of  Spain  will share the costs of the utilityâ€™s 60
million-euro pilot project for a smart grid, Cinco Dias
reported.   The utility and EVE, an electricity unit of the regional
government, will form a company this week for installing 230,000
advanced electricity meters and adapt 1,100 transformers in the
Basque cities of Bilbao and Portugalete, the report said, citing
a company presentation.  Iberdrola Chief Executive Officer Ignacio Galan has said an
investment of 5.5 billion euros is needed to extend smart-grid
technology across the nation, an advanced technology that will
allow utilities to repair their power outages more quickly, the
report said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
