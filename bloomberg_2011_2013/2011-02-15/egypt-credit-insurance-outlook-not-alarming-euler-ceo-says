The outlook for credit insurance in
Egypt and Tunisia is not “alarming or catastrophic,” said
Wilfried Verstraete, chief executive officer of  Euler Hermes SA ,
the world’s largest trade-credit insurer.  “As of today we have not seen any increase of claim
notifications in Egypt and Tunisia,” Verstraete said in an
interview. “For the moment, we have not cut our exposure
dramatically in these countries.” The Paris-based unit of  Allianz SE  is following the situation “very closely” and has
taken “appropriate measures” to contain risks, he said.  Egypt’s finance minister, Samir Radwan, said yesterday the
country’s budget deficit will widen to about 8.4 percent -- less
than some analyst’s estimates -- as spending increases and
economic growth slows after President  Hosni Mubarak ’s decision
to step down. The protests that culminated in the Feb. 11 ouster
of Mubarak have led businesses to shut down, scared off tourists
and pushed up borrowing costs.  Egypt’s uprising followed the Jan. 14 toppling of Tunisian
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.  For the Tunisian and Egyptian economies, “the upswing
could be extremely important once you have more clarity about
the democratic transition,” Verstraete said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
