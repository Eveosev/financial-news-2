The yen fell versus most of its
major counterparts, dropping to the lowest level in almost two
months against the dollar, as investors used Japan’s currency to
buy assets in countries with higher  interest rates .  The euro erased gains versus the dollar as European
officials discussed ways to deal with their region’s sovereign-
debt crisis. Sterling strengthened versus all 16 its most-traded
peers as U.K. inflation rose and investors increased bets the
Bank of England will raise interest rates.  “The reason for the yen weakness is that we’re seeing
tell-tale signs of the yen carry trade,” said  Michael Woolfolk ,
senior currency strategist in New York at Bank of New York
Mellon Corp., the world’s largest custodial bank. “Zero
interest rates in Japan are prompting Japanese and even foreign
investors to borrow in cheap yen and invest in higher-yielding
assets outside of Japan. That came out of nowhere.”  The yen dropped 0.5 percent to 83.77 per dollar at 5 p.m.
in  New York , from 83.32 yesterday, and touched 83.92, the
weakest level since Dec. 20. The euro strengthened 0.5 percent
to 112.99 yen, from 112.40 yesterday. The shared currency was
little changed at $1.3487, from $1.3489, after earlier gaining
as much as 0.5 percent to $1.3551.  Japan’s currency has tumbled 3.4 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a
gauge of 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro has gained 0.9
percent, and the dollar has risen 0.1 percent.  Carry Currency  The yen has returned 19 percent as a carry currency this
year against the Australian, Norwegian,  New Zealand  and
Brazilian currencies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with a loss of 2.7 percent last year, when the
Japanese currency gained to a 15-year high versus the dollar.  Under the carry trade, investors borrow where interest
rates are low to buy higher-yielding assets elsewhere. Japan’s
0.1 percent benchmark rate makes the yen popular for funding
such transactions. Key rates in other countries range from 2
percent in  Norway  to  Brazil ’s 11.25 percent.  The yen reached its low of the day versus the dollar as
two-year Treasury yields rose to 0.88 percent, the highest level
in more than eight months. They later fell 0.02 percentage point
to 0.82 percent. The yield on the Japanese two-year security was
0.24 percent.    Portugal ’s 10-year bond yields traded at almost the highest
level since the euro’s introduction in 1999 after European
finance ministers said they saw no need for immediate steps on
the debt crisis and the European Financial Stability Facility,
the rescue pool until 2013. The securities yielded 7.41 percent
after reaching 7.64 percent on Feb. 10.  German Opposition  Ministers shifted the focus away from near-term  crisis
management  with a decision yesterday that the permanent aid
mechanism to be set up in 2013 will be able to lend 500 billion
euros ($674 billion).  Germany  has opposed a stepped-up rescue
effort until European governments take fresh measures to bolster
the region’s competitiveness.  Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos
said delays in overhauling the bailout effort threaten a new
bout of market turmoil. He spoke today at the ministers’ meeting
in Brussels.  U.S. stocks declined, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
retreating 0.34 percent.  Global demand for U.S. stocks, bonds and other financial
assets fell less than forecast in December, Treasury data
showed. Net buying of long-term equities, notes and bonds
totaled $65.9 billion in the month, compared with net buying of
$85.1 billion in November, according to the data. A Bloomberg
News survey forecast a drop to $40 billion.  German Confidence  The euro earlier advanced against the dollar as data showed
German investor confidence increased this month and U.S. retail
sales rose in January less than economists forecast.  “The growth numbers weren’t exceptional, but show a decent
trajectory,” said  Jessica Hoversen , a Chicago-based analyst at
the futures broker MF Global Holdings Ltd. “The lack of
resolution on the EFSF has not triggered broad-based euro
weakness today.”  Commerce Department data showed U.S. retail purchases rose
0.3 percent last month, the smallest gain since a drop in June.
Economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted a gain of 0.5
percent.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research said its
index of German investor and analyst expectations increased to
15.7, from 15.4 in January, a fourth monthly gain. Economists
forecast a rise to 20, according to a separate Bloomberg survey.  Sterling Gains  The pound strengthened against the dollar and euro for a
second day and short-sterling futures fell after U.K. consumer
prices grew an annual 4 percent last month, the fastest since
November 2008. The implied yield on the short-sterling futures
contract expiring in December increased 0.05 percentage point to
1.75 percent as traders raised bets that the  Bank of England 
will boost interest rates.  Sterling appreciated 0.5 percent to $1.6126. Against the
euro, the pound added 0.6 percent to 83.63 pence.  The  Mexican peso  was the worst performer against the
greenback today. The peso fell the most in more than two weeks
after the report on retail sales in the U.S.,  Mexico ’s largest
trading partner. It dropped 0.8 percent to 12.1481 per  U.S.
dollar , from 12.0508 yesterday. The decline was the biggest on a
closing basis since Jan. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
