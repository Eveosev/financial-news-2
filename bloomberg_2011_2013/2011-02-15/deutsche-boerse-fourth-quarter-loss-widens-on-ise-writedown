  Deutsche Boerse AG , which announced
today it will buy NYSE Euronext and create the world’s largest
operator of stock and derivatives exchanges, reported its
fourth-quarter loss widened after it took a second writedown on
its International Securities Exchange business.  The net loss for the three months ended Dec. 31 was 61.2
million euros ($82.7 million), compared with a 33 million-euro
loss in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Frankfurt-based company
said in an earnings statement today. Analysts projected a 76.9
million-euro loss, according to the mean estimate of six
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The exchange, which also took a
writedown on ISE in the fourth quarter of 2009, today said it
took a 453.3 million euro charge for ISE.  “‘We do not think the fourth-quarter earnings themselves
will be particularly in focus given the ongoing merger talks
with  NYSE Euronext ,’’ said Karl Morris, an analyst at Keefe,
Bruyette & Woods, in a note before the earnings were announced.
‘‘We are positive on the potential merger.’’ He rates the stock
‘‘outperform.’’  Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext today said they will
combine in a $9.53 billion all-stock agreement.  Deutsche Boerse ,  Europe ’s largest securities exchange, said on Dec. 10 it would
take a second writedown on ISE that would wipe ‘‘in the range
of’’ 220 million euros off 2010 net income. The exchange had
previously said it would take an impairment charge ‘‘in the
range of’’ 450 million euros for 2010 and ‘‘the impairment
charge will be partially offset by a reduction in deferred tax
liabilities relating to ISE.’’  The exchange also said a one-time gain related to its
Clearstream unit would ‘‘have a positive impact on earnings of
about 440 million euros.’’  Business Segments  Deutsche Boerse owns the  Frankfurt  stock exchange and is
part-owner of Eurex, Europe’s largest futures market, along with
the Swiss exchange. Eurex bought New York-based International
Securities Exchange Holdings Inc. in 2007. Deutsche Boerse also
owns Clearstream, the region’s second-largest securities-
settlement company, as well as Eurex Clearing.  Fourth-quarter sales rose to 518.4 million euros from 505.4
million euros in the comparable period a year earlier.  Fourth-quarter revenue from the exchange’s Eurex
derivatives market rose to 202.8 million euros from 199.9
million euros. Clearstream revenue climbed to 191.1 million
euros from 186.3 million euros, the company said in a statement
on its website. Sales from equity trading dropped to 63.2
million euros from 71.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
