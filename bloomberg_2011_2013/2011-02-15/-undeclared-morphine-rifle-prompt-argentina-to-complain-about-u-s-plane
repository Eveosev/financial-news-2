Relations between  Argentina  and the
U.S. worsened after the South American country filed a complaint
about a U.S. Air Force plane it says arrived in Buenos Aires
with “suspicious” material for a police training exercise.  “So far neither the U.S. Embassy nor its government have
given satisfactory explanations to clarify the presence of non-
declared cargo,” the Foreign Ministry said in an e-mail
statement last night. Foreign Minister Hector Timerman said the
cargo on the plane, which arrived Feb. 10, included weapons,
communications equipment and expired morphine.  Police and customs officials at the Buenos Aires-based
international airport  seized  1,000 cubic feet of material that
wasn’t included on a list that the U.S. provided to the
government in December, according to the Foreign Ministry. U.S.
State Department spokesman  Philip J. Crowley  said the cargo was
“fully coordinated” with Argentina.  The dispute over the military plane comes after President  Barack Obama  decided against visiting Argentina during his first
South American trip next month and after diplomatic cables
released by WikiLeaks, an organization that publishes secret
documents on its website, suggested corruption among members of
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s Cabinet.  Relations ‘Strained’  The plane’s cargo was to be used in a police course on
hostage rescue, Timerman said on his Twitter account on Feb. 13.
Argentines are sensitive about avoiding a third terrorist attack
on their soil after bombings against Jewish targets in the early
1990s, Timerman said in an interview on  CNN ’s Spanish-language
channel yesterday.  U.S. Representative Connie Mack, chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, said he
thought the government of Argentina made “bogus” claims
against the  United States  for domestic political reasons.  “I don’t think the idea that we’re smuggling weapons or
drugs into Argentina is credible,” Mack, a Republican of  Florida , said in an interview today. “This is just part of the
playbook. You make an allegation against the United States and
it helps you in your own election, your own country.”  When asked if the incident has damaged U.S.-Argentinian
relations, Mack said, “I think the relations have been strained
in the first place.”  Diego Guelar, a former Argentine ambassador to the U.S.,
said the government intentionally opened a new conflict with the
U.S. in return for earlier disputes over Obama’s trip to the
region, the WikiLeaks cables and a scandal over the arrival of a
Venezuelan-American businessman with $800,000 in his suitcase in
2007.  “I think it’s childish, ridiculous, rude and
unnecessary,” said Guelar, who currently advises the opposition
party PRO on international affairs. “All the country should
have done was leave the undeclared cargo on the plane until it
could be sent back when the plane departs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
