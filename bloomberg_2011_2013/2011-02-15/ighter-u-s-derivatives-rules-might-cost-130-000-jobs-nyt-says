Tighter U.S. rules for trading in
the $600 billion  derivatives market  might cost as many as
130,000 jobs and cut company spending by as much as $6.7
billion, the New York Times reported, citing a study by
Keybridge Research.  The study, which was backed by pro-business groups, was
released Monday, a day before financial regulators are due to
testify before the House Financial Services Committee.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
