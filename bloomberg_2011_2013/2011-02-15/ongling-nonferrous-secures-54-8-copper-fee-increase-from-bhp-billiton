(Corrects refining fee to cents from dollars in story first
published on Feb. 15.)  Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co.
secured a 54.8 percent increase in treatment and refining
charges for processing copper concentrate in the first half from  BHP Billiton Ltd ., the smelter said today.  Tongling agreed $72 per metric ton for treatment fees and
7.2 cents per pound for refining fees with the Australian mining
company on Jan. 20, it said in a statement to the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange. That compares with $46.5/4.65 for 2010, it said.  The increase will have a “positive impact” on the company,
it said. The company will purchase 40,000 dry tons of
concentrate from BHP in the first half and will negotiate fees
for the second half, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
