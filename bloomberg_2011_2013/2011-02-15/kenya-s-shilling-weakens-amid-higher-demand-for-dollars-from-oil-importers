  Kenya ’s shilling weakened amid
increased demand for dollars from oil importers seeking to pay
for their shipments and ahead of a parliamentary ruling on
judicial appointments that sparked a political dispute.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.7 percent and was trading at to 81.40 against the U.S.
currency at 2:03 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. It closed at
81.20 yesterday.  “The shilling has weakened due to high demand for dollars
by the energy sector and is expected to remain under pressure as
the country awaits the tabling of parliamentary committee
reports today on the constitutionality of President Mwai Kibaki’s nomination of the judicial officers and controller of
budget,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-based
Kenya Commercial Bank, said in a phone interview today.  Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  last month objected to Kibaki’s
nomination of a new chief justice, director of public
prosecution, attorney general and budget controller, citing a
lack of consultation as required under Kenyan law.  When the nominees’ names were submitted to parliament for
approval, Kenneth Marende, the speaker of the National Assembly,
referred the matter to the justice and legal affairs and finance
and planning committees. The two panels are expected to table
their reports later today, before Marende makes a ruling on the
appointments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
