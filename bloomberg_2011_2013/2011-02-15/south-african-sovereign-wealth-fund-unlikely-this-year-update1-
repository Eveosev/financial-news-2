  South Africa ’s government is
unlikely to create a sovereign-wealth fund this year, according
to Richard Levin, director-general of the Department of Economic
Development.  Proposals to establish the fund, which would be used to
help manage foreign reserves and the value of the currency, are
contained in the government’s new growth plan, unveiled by
Economic Development Minister  Ebrahim Patel  on Nov. 23.  “We need to do quite a lot of technical work” before the
fund can be set up, Levin said in an interview in Cape Town
today.  The fund will invest in development projects in Africa and
should ensure South  Africa  diversifies its industrial base as
its  mineral resources  are depleted, Patel said in a Nov. 23
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
