The cost to the Australian economy of
tackling climate change will increase because of a “late start
globally” in efforts to curb carbon emissions, the federal
government’s  climate change  adviser  Ross Garnaut  said.  “The costs of some low-emissions technologies appear to
have been falling faster than anticipated,” Garnaut wrote in
the first of eight reports today updating his 2008 analysis.
“However, a late start globally on mitigation has raised
anticipated costs of both climate change and its mitigation.”  Julia Gillard pledged to restart an effort to combat
climate change after replacing  Kevin Rudd  as Australian prime
minister in June and has said that lawmakers must decide in 2011
on a way to put a price on carbon emissions. Rudd had shelved an
emissions-trading plan, citing opposition in the upper house
Senate and a lack of action by other countries.  Garnaut, commissioned by the government in November to
update his climate change review, is considering “whether the
case for the conclusions drawn in 2008 has been strengthened or
weakened,” analyzing issues such as developments in technology.  Since 2008, the “climate change science has developed,
mostly in ways that heighten rather than ease concerns,” he
wrote today. Garnaut added that “the case for substantial and
well-designed Australian action to encourage international
agreement on climate responses remains compelling.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Paton  in Sydney   jpaton4@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
