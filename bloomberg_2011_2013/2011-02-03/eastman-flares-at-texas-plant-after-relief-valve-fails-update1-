  Eastman Chemical Co . reported flaring
after a relief valve failed in hydrocarbon-cracking plant 4 at
its complex in Longview, Texas, according to a filing with state
regulators.  “An upset in the plant’s debutanizer distillation column
caused its relief valve to discharge to the flare,” the company
said in a  filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality. “This relief valve did not fully reseat, so the
release of process material to the flare is ongoing.”  Cold weather caused the valve failure, Kristin Sturgill, a
company spokeswoman based at company headquarters in Kingsport,  Tennessee , said in an e-mail today. Production wasn’t affected
and no one was injured, she said.  The valve is expected to be replaced tomorrow, according to
the filing, and "the release of process material to the flare is
ongoing."  The facility, called a cracker, uses pressure and heat to
split oil products like naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases.
Outages can increase prices for ethylene and propylene as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts.  The Longview chemical complex uses 55,000 barrels a day of
propane and ethane as feedstocks to make 40 chemical products,
according to the company’s  website . It’s supplied by seven
pipelines from the  Texas  Gulf Coast and can produce almost
500,000 metric tons of ethylene a year.  Longview is 126 miles (203 kilometers) east of  Dallas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
