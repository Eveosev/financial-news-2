  MF Global Holdings Ltd ., the futures
and options broker named yesterday as a primary dealer by the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York , reported its seventh loss in
the past two years on legal costs and severance payments.  The third-quarter net loss narrowed to $9.7 million, or 6
cents a share, for the period ended Dec. 31, from $22.3 million,
or 18 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based company said in
an e-mailed statement. Excluding certain items, MF Global earned
3 cents a share, missing the average estimate of 5 cents,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts.  Chief Executive Officer  Jon Corzine , the former Governor of  New Jersey  who ran Goldman Sachs Group Inc. from 1994 to 1999,
has set the goal of remaking MF Global into a mid-size
investment bank by 2015. The firm has been profitable in one of
the past eight straight quarters. Lower futures volumes and
overnight interest-rates near zero percent have hurt earnings.  “MF Global has taken the necessary steps to define our
future and I believe we have crafted a strategic path forward to
transition from a broker, to a broker-dealer, and eventually to
a commodities and capital markets focused global investment
bank,” Corzine said in the statement.  In May, Corzine called the company’s fiscal 2010
performance “unacceptable” after it posted a $96.5 million
loss for the three months ended March 31. He cut pay and
eliminated jobs, giving shareholders their only profit in two
years for the quarter ended June 30.  Severance Cost  Last quarter’s loss included a $5.5 million for severance
costs and $2.5 million in preliminary legal costs, the company
said.  MF Global, formerly the brokerage unit of Man Group Plc,
the world’s largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager, fell 12
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $8.36 in  New York  Stock Exchange
composite trading as of 4:18 p.m. The stock has gained 23
percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
