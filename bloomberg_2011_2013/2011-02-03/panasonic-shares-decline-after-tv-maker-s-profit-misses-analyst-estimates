  Panasonic Corp ., the world’s largest
maker of plasma televisions, fell the most in more than two
months in Tokyo trading after the company reported profit that
missed analyst estimates.  The stock dropped as much as 2.8 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Nov. 24, to 1,094 yen and traded at 1,100
yen as of 10:13 a.m. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
fell 0.2 percent.  Panasonic reported third-quarter net income of 40 billion
yen ($490 million) yesterday, missing the 44.7 billion yen
average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Operating profit fell unexpectedly. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc.’s securities unit cut its share-price estimate for
Panasonic.  The company’s quarterly profit was lower than expected,
giving a “negative impression,” Masahiko Ishino, an analyst
for the brokerage in Tokyo, wrote in a report yesterday. He cut
his price estimate for Panasonic to 1,200 yen from 1,300 yen.  Third-quarter operating profit, or sales minus the cost of
goods sold and administrative expenses, declined 5.6 percent to
95.3 billion yen, Panasonic said yesterday. That missed the
105.5 billion yen average analyst estimate.  Third-quarter profit at the company’s main audiovisual
product division fell 1 percent to 39.9 billion yen as sales of
plasma TVs dropped 13 percent. Income from the components
division tumbled 81 percent on lower demand for chips used in
computers, TVs and cameras.  Panasonic kept its full-year earnings forecasts unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
