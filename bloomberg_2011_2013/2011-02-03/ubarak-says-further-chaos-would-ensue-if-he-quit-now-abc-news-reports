  Egypt ’s President  Hosni Mubarak ,
beset by protesters demanding his immediate resignation, told
ABC News that if he left office right away it would lead to
further chaos in the country.  “If I resign today there will be chaos,” Mubarak told  Christiane Amanpour  of ABC News, according to a summary of the
interview on the  ABC News website . Mubarak told Amanpour that he
would like to leave now, but if he did the Muslim Brotherhood
party would take over.  Mubarak said he told President  Barack Obama  that the U.S.
doesn’t “understand the Egyptian culture and what would happen
if I step down now,” according to ABC News.  Mubarak said he was “fed up with being president” and
“never intended to run again. I never intended Gamal to be
president after me,” ABC News quoted him as saying.  Gamal Mubarak  is the president’s son.  Mubarak told ABC News that he was unhappy with pro-
government groups clashing with anti-government protesters
yesterday in Cairo, after Mubarak announced his plans to leave
following elections later this year. He told ABC News that no
force would be used against protesters, according to the news
website.  ABC News reported that newly appointed vice president Omar Suleiman also told Amanpour that the government would “never
authorize force against the people,” according to the website.
Suleiman told ABC News that protesters had “legitimate
grievances” and that the government had met their demands by
agreeing to step down after elections as well as carrying out
constitutional reforms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
