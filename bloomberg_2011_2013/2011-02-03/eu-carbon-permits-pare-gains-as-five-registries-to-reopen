European Union carbon permits pared
gains after the European Commission in Brussels said five
registries that track ownership will reopen tomorrow after a 15-
day halt.  EU allowances for December rose as much as 1.1 percent to
15.14 euros a metric ton in  London , their highest level for more
than seven weeks, and were at 15.04 euros as of 8:28 a.m. on the
ICE Futures Europe Exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
