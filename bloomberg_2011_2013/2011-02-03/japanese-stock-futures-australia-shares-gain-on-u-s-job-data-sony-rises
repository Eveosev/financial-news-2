Japanese stock futures and Australian
shares rose as U.S. jobless claims decreased by more than
forecast and earnings in Japan improved, adding to confidence in
the pace of the global economic recovery.  American depositary receipts of Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest
exporter of consumer electronics, rose 2 percent after reporting
profit that beat analysts’ estimates. Those of Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 1 publicly traded bank, gained
1.1 percent after profit more than doubled.  Nippon Steel Corp .
was bid higher in premarket in Japan after announcing a plan to
merge with Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. BHP Billiton Ltd.,  Australia ’s largest oil producer, climbed 0.4 percent.  “Domestic demand in the U.S. is on track for recovery,”
said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura
Holdings Inc. “Improving corporate earnings are leading to a
positive shift in employment.”  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,495 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
10,440 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,500 in  Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. today. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.4 percent today, while  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index
gained 0.4 percent.  Stock markets in  China ,  Hong Kong ,  South Korea  and  Singapore  are shut today for the Lunar New Year holiday, and
exchanges in Taiwan and  Vietnam  have been closed all week.  Tensions in Egypt  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index climbed 0.2 percent yesterday in  New
York  as retailers gained after sales exceeded projections and
jobless claims decreased by more than forecast.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 42,000 to
415,000 in the week ended Jan. 29. Economists forecast claims
would fall to 420,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. Economists estimate the Feb. 4 report
from the Labor Department will show employers probably added
140,000 jobs in January as the  unemployment rate  rose to 9.5
percent from 9.4 percent the prior month.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1 percent this year
to yesterday, compared with gains of 3.9 percent for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 3.3 percent for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 14.1
times estimated earnings on average at the last close, compared
with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Sony, the Tokyo-based maker of Bravia televisions, reported
net income dropped 8.6 percent to 72.3 billion yen ($886
million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, from 79.2 billion
yen a year earlier, beating the 65.9 billion yen average of six
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Mitsubishi UFJ  Mitsubishi UFJ joined smaller rival Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. in posting third-quarter profit that more than doubled as
bad-loan costs fell. Net income climbed to 195.1 billion yen
($2.4 billion) in the three months ended Dec. 31, from 76.1
billion yen a year earlier.  About 220 of the 1,019 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements this week. Of the 296
that have reported results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter,
123 have exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 96 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Other stocks that may be active today include Nippon Steel
Corp. and  Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd ., Japan’s largest and
third-biggest steelmakers. The companies plan to combine to cut
costs in what may be the country’s biggest non-bank takeover,
aimed at gaining leverage over raw-material purchases and
pricing of the metal as costs soar.  “If domestic competition is mitigated, there’s more chance
of guaranteeing profit margins,” said Juichi Wako, a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “Expectations
are increasing for improved performance in the steel industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
