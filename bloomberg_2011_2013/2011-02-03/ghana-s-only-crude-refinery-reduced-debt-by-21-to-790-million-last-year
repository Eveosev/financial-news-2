Ghana’s  state-owned Tema Oil Refinery
Ltd., the country’s only crude processor, cut debt 21 percent to
1.25 billion cedis ($790 million) last year as the government
tried to reduce the burden on the nation’s banks.    Ghana  paid 670 million cedis to Tema’s creditors and banks
last year after the government raised funds through a sale of
three-year bonds in  March , Fifi Kwetey, deputy minister of
finance and economic planning, said by phone today from the
capital, Accra.  The government is looking at ways of further reducing
Tema’s debt, he said. “We’re currently discussing how we should
raise the money,” Kwetey said. “The burden of the debt,
especially on the banking industry, needs to be reduced.”  The refinery, which produces 45,000 barrels a day, has
struggled with credit problems since 2009.  Tema , located in the
port city of the same name, now relies on credit from  oil
companies  and letters of credit from banks to import crude, the
government has said.  As of Dec. 31, the refinery owed 572 million cedis to  Ghana
Commercial Bank Ltd ., the West African nation’s biggest lender,
down from 750 million cedis at the end of 2009, Kwetey said. Oil
companies were owed 420 million cedis, down from 539 million
cedis a year earlier, he said.  The rest of the debt is owed to other banks including the
local units of Standard Chartered Bank Plc and Barclays Bank
Plc, Kwetey said.  Ghana, the world’s second-largest cocoa exporter, is  Africa ’s newest oil producer, having started output from its
offshore Jubilee field in December. Jubilee, estimated to hold
about 800 million barrels of reserves, is operated by  Tullow Oil
Plc , which has also announced finds at the Tweneboa and Owo
wells, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) west of Jubilee.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
