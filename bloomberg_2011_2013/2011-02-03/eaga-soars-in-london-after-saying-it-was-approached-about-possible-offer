  Eaga Plc , a U.K. energy efficiency
provider, rose the most since 2007 in London trading after
saying it received an approach that may lead to an offer.  The approach came from “an independent strategic party”
outside the  energy industry , the Newcastle Upon Tyne, England-
based provider of energy solutions said in a Regulatory News
Service statement today.  The possible bidder supports “in principle” a project to
install solar photovoltaic equipment in public housing,
according to the statement. Eaga runs the U.K. state-funded Warm
Front heating insulation program, which the government said last
year will be phased out as part of public spending cuts.  The shares surged as much as 21 percent, the most since
June 2007, to 97 pence, the highest since Oct. 20, when the
government said the insulation program would end. They traded at
95 pence as of 1:52 p.m., giving the company a market value of
238.8 million pounds ($387 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
