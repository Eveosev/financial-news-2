The Australian dollar strengthened to
a one-month high against the greenback after the  Reserve Bank 
said the economy will expand more than previously forecast this
year as flood rebuilding accelerates in the second half.    Australia ’s currency advanced versus all its 16 major
counterparts as the central bank also raised its growth and
inflation forecasts in a quarterly report. The so-called Aussie
gained before a U.S. report that economists said will show
employers added the most jobs in three months in January,
spurring demand for higher-yielding assets.  “The initial picture you get from the statement is a
strong recovery that will see inflation through mid-2012 pushing
the upper end of the band,” said  Robert Rennie , chief currency
strategist in Sydney at Westpac Banking Corp., Australia’s
second-biggest lender. “The RBA is looking through the short-
term impact of the recent floods. That is all about growth and a
strong economy. So from that point of view, good for the
Australian dollar.”  Australia’s currency rose to $1.0189 as of 4:26 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0153 in  New York  yesterday, after appreciating to
$1.0195, the highest since Jan. 3. The Aussie advanced 0.3
percent to 83.09 yen, after reaching 83.17, the strongest since
Jan. 6. The currency has gained 2.5 percent against the
greenback and 1.9 percent versus the yen this week.  ‘Strong Recovery’  The  Reserve Bank of Australia  raised its growth forecast
for 2011 to 4.25 percent from a November prediction of 3.75
percent. Consumer prices will increase 3 percent this year, from
a previous estimate of 2.75 percent, said the central bank,
which aims to keep inflation between 2 and 3 percent.  “The recent floods will have a material effect on the
near-term profile of gross domestic product, with growth in the
December and March quarters notably lower,” the RBA said in its
 report . That will be followed by a “strong recovery in the June
quarter as coal production picks up and the rebuilding effort
gets underway.”  The central bank has left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 4.75 percent for the past two meetings after seven
increases from October 2009 to November 2010.  Swaps traders are betting RBA Governor Glenn Stevens will
increase the benchmark by 38 basis points over the next 12
months, up from a prediction of 30 basis points yesterday,
according to a Credit Suisse AG index.  N.Z. Dollar  The  New Zealand dollar  held onto yesterday’s gain versus
the yen before today’s U.S. jobs report.  U.S. employers added 146,000 workers in January after
hiring 103,000 in December, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of the Labor Department’s
figures. The report may also show the jobless rate increased to
9.5 percent from 9.4 percent.  “The bias is for the dollar to be sold as a funding
currency for higher-yielding currencies as the outlook for the
global economy led by the U.S. is looking firm,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, a senior analyst in Tokyo at Ueda Harlow Ltd.  New Zealand’s dollar traded at 77.28 U.S. cents from 77.34
cents. The currency was at 63.10 yen from 63.13 yen yesterday,
when it climbed 0.1 percent.  Benchmark interest rates in Australia and  New Zealand ,
where it’s 3 percent, compare with as low as zero in the U.S.
and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific nations’
assets. The risk in such trades is that currency market moves
will erase profits.  Australian bond futures fell. Ten-year contracts for March
delivery declined 0.08 to 94.30 on the  Sydney Futures Exchange .
The implied yield climbed eight basis points to 5.70 percent.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, rose one basis point to 3.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
