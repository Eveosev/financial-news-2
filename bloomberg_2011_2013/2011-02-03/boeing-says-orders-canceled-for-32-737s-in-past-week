  Boeing Co . lost an order for 32 737
jets, valued at about $2.3 billion at list prices, from Dubai
Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., the state-owned leasing and services
company that has said it may drop some purchases.  Dubai Aerospace’s current backlog for 737s is 35, according
to a monthly update yesterday on  Boeing’s website , compared with
67 as of December. Separately, Boeing’s weekly order report
showed 32 orders for the single-aisle aircraft had been
canceled, without identifying the buyer.  Dubai Aerospace has been studying whether to scrap more
orders as aircraft demand wanes, two people with knowledge of
the matter said in December, after canceling plans last year to
buy 47 jets from Boeing and Airbus SAS. An e-mailed request for
comment to the company’s headquarters before regular business
hours today wasn’t immediately returned.  “It would be inappropriate for Boeing to comment on the
details of our agreements with customers,” said Marc Birtel, a
spokesman for the planemaker in  Seattle , where the company’s
commercial operations are based.  Dubai Aerospace was set up in 2006, entering the leasing
market during the peak of an air-travel boom, with the aim of
becoming one of the world’s biggest airplane lessors. Airlines
and leasing companies typically don’t pay list prices.  Boeing also won an order for 10 737s from an unidentified
customer, according to yesterday’s update. The order and
cancellation brought the Chicago-based company’s net orders for
the model in January to zero. Boeing won an order last month for
two of its twin-aisle 777 jetliners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
