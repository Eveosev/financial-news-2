  Enbridge Inc . is offering native
groups a stake in a $5.5 billion oil-sands pipeline to the
Pacific to help win their support, Chief Executive Officer
Patrick D. Daniel said.  The company will give aboriginal groups a 10 percent stake
in the Northern Gateway project “at no cost,” Daniel said
during an investor conference call today. China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. is one of a group of investors in the pipeline,
which would bring as much as 525,000 barrels a day to a port in
British Columbia.  Some native groups oppose the  project  because of potential
environmental risks posed as it crosses largely undeveloped
areas of  Canada ’s westernmost province. The National Energy
Board will determine whether there is enough support for the
project, Daniel said.  The company is “working very closely with those that are
not yet convinced to try to turn their ‘no’ to a ‘yes,’” he
said. “We truly do want very broad, general and thorough
support for the project because of its huge strategic value and
interest to this country.”  Enbridge, based in Calgary, today reported fourth-quarter
net income of C$326 million ($329 million), or 86 cents a share,
from C$300 million, or 80 cents, a year earlier.  Enbridge fell 83 cents, or 1.4 percent, to C$57.68 at 4:10
p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares, which have eight
buy and eight hold recommendations from analysts, have gained
2.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
