Japanese stocks dropped as company
earnings missed analysts’ estimates and violence flared among
protesters in  Egypt ’s 10th day of unrest. Commodity suppliers
drove Australian shares higher as crude-oil prices increased.  Chiyoda Corp., a Japanese engineering company that counts
the Middle East as its main market by sales, slipped 0.5 percent.  Panasonic Corp ., the world’s largest maker of plasma televisions,
dropped 3.2 percent in Tokyo after the company’s profit missed
analysts’ estimates. BHP Billiton Ltd.,  Australia ’s biggest oil
producer, gained 1.4 percent in Sydney as crude rose on concern
the tensions in Egypt will disrupt supplies from the Middle East.  “If the demonstrations in Egypt spill over to oil-
producing countries, the price of crude will rise further and
inflation will accelerate, boosting concerns about the economic
future of emerging countries,” said Hisakazu Amano, who helps
oversee about $29 billion at Tokyo-based T&D Asset Management Co.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.3 percent to
10,431.36 at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo, with about as
many shares declining as advancing. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index climbed 0.5 percent, also with about as many stocks up as
down.  India ’s Sensitive Index gained 1.5 percent. Thailand’s SET
Index increased 0.2 percent.  Stock markets in  China ,  Hong Kong ,  South Korea  and  Singapore  shut yesterday for the Lunar New Year holiday, and
exchanges in Taiwan and  Vietnam  have been closed all week.  Tensions in Egypt  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.2 percent
today. The index fell 0.3 percent yesterday in New York as
earnings reports disappointed investors and as the protests in
Egypt worsened.  Gunfire erupted early today in Cairo’s Tahrir Square after
supporters of Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  clashed with
demonstrators demanding an immediate end to his 30-year reign.
More than 600 people were injured and at least three killed in
the clashes, according to state television.  Chiyoda Corp., which receives about 47 percent of its sales
from the Middle East, slipped 0.5 percent to 733 yen. Fanuc
Corp., the world’s largest maker of controls that run  machine
tools  and which gets more than 70 percent of its sales abroad,
dropped 3.5 percent to 12,390 yen. It was the heaviest drag on
the  Nikkei 225 .  “The concern is whether unrest in the Middle East will be
more than what the market expects,” said Mitsushige Akino, who
oversees about $450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co.  Energy Companies  Raw-material companies gained the most today among the 10
industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. BHP advanced 1.4
percent to A$46.32 in Sydney, while Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
No. 3 mining company, gained 0.4 percent to A$86.20. Mitsui &
Co., a trading company that counts commodities as its largest
source of profit, increased 1.9 percent to 1,476 yen. They were
among the biggest supports on the MSCI index.  Crude oil for March delivery increased 0.1 percent to
settle at $90.86 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange
yesterday, after earlier climbing as much as 1.1 percent, amid
concern that the unrest in Egypt may threaten exports from the
Middle East.  Panasonic lost 3.2 percent to 1,090 yen after reporting net
income rose 24 percent to 40 billion yen ($491 million), missing
the 44.7 billion yen average of four analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., a Japanese drugmaker,
lost 1.7 percent to 1,502 yen after saying net income dropped 27
percent. Credit Saison Co., a consumer lender, declined 1.8
percent to 1,451 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported the
company’s operating profit likely fell 45 percent.  Earnings Peak  This week is the peak for quarterly results in Japan, with
more than a third of the Topix index’s 1,668 companies scheduled
to report earnings. Of the 693 that have reported net income
since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 95 have exceeded analysts’
estimates, while 79 have missed them, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.1 percent this year
to yesterday, compared with gains of 3.7 percent for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 3.2 percent for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 14.1
times estimated earnings on average at the last close, compared
with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Indorama Ventures Pcl,  Thailand ’s biggest maker of
chemicals used in the production of plastic bottles and
polyester, rose after the company’s biggest shareholder
reaffirmed a plan to exercise options to buy stock. The shares
gained 5.7 percent to 41.75 baht, the biggest increase on the
MSCI Asia Pacific index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
