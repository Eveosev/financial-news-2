The euro retreated the most in two
months against the dollar, while oil reversed earlier gains, as
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  dimmed
prospects for an interest-rate increase. Most U.S. stocks fell
and 10-year Treasuries dropped for a fourth day.  The euro slid 1.2 percent to $1.3647 at 11:53 a.m. in New
York after tumbling as much as 1.4 percent. Two-year German bund
yields sank 14 basis points to 1.35 percent.  Brent crude , the
benchmark grade for two-thirds of the world’s oil market, was
little changed at $102.40 after earlier reaching the highest
price in 28 months. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1
percent while the 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points.  The shared European currency extended losses as Trichet
said risks from rising prices are “broadly balanced,” causing
investors to pare bets on an increase in borrowing costs even
after euro-area inflation accelerated the most in two years in
January. The dollar also strengthened after reports showed U.S.
service industries grew at the fastest pace since 2005 and
jobless claims fell more than estimated.  “Trichet’s comments have prompted a sharp decline in short-
term European rates,” said  Marc Chandler , global head of
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in  New York .
“I don’t see him saying anything different from what he said
last time. The difference is that inflation went up in the euro
zone since December. There have been few signs that selling the
euro was a low risk venture. Today could very well be the
turning point.”  Euro, Dollar  The euro weakened against 14 of 16 major peers, losing more
than 1.2 percent versus the Australian dollar and Japanese yen.  The dollar strengthened against 15 of 16 counterparts, led
by a 1.6 percent rally versus the South African rand. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-manufacturing
businesses, which covers service industries accounting for about
90 percent of the  U.S. economy , rose to 59.4 and topped
forecasts.  Data from the Labor Department showed new claims for  unemployment benefits  dropped by 42,000 to 415,000 last week.
Economists forecast claims would fall to 420,000, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Exxon Mobil Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.
paced losses in shares of U.S. commodity producers as oil and
copper prices erased earlier gains. Merck & Co. slid 2.5 percent
to lead declines in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  after its
2011 profit forecast trailed analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
