The productivity of U.S. workers
unexpectedly increased in the fourth quarter at a faster rate as
companies sought to contain costs.  The measure of employee output per hour rose at a 2.6
percent annual rate, compared with a revised 2.4 percent gain in
the previous three months, figures from the Labor Department
showed today in Washington. Economists projected a 2 percent
advance, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. Labor expenses fell for fifth time in six quarters.  Employment may improve as companies such as Ford Motor
Corp., which cut jobs and boosted efficiency during the
recession, now look to expand as sales pick up. Falling labor
costs give the Federal Reserve more reason to stick to its
unconventional easing program through June.  “There is a good chance that productivity will slow
further this year, as firms are increasingly forced to hire more
workers to expand output,”  Paul Ashworth , chief U.S. economist
at Capital Economics Ltd. in Toronto, said in a note to clients.
“That is good news for the unemployed.”  Estimates of the 68 economists surveyed ranged from
increases of 0.4 percent to 3 percent.  Another Labor Department report showed the number of
Americans filing first-time claims for  unemployment insurance 
fell last week, led by southern states that were affected by
storms in prior weeks. Applications for jobless benefits
decreased by 42,000 to 415,000 in the week ended Jan. 29.  Stock-Index Futures  Stock-index futures held earlier losses as oil advanced
after protests in  Egypt  turned violent. The March contract on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.1 percent to 1,298.2
at 9:07 a.m. in  New York . Treasuries fell, pushing up the yield
on the benchmark 10-year note to 3.50 percent from 3.48 percent
late yesterday.  Labor costs, adjusted for efficiency gains, dropped at a
0.6 percent pace following a 0.1 percent drop in the prior
quarter, the Labor Department’s productivity report showed.
Costs were projected to rise 0.2 percent, according to the
Bloomberg survey median.  For all of 2010, productivity climbed 3.6 percent, the most
since 2002. Labor costs fell 1.5 percent after a 1.6 percent
decrease in 2009. It was the first back-to-back drop since 1962-
63, the Labor Department said.  Among manufacturers, productivity rose at a 5.8 percent
annual pace, the most in a year, after rising 1.4 percent in the
third quarter of the year.  Employment Forecast  The Labor Department may report tomorrow that the U.S.
added 140,000 jobs in January, according to economist forecasts
in a Bloomberg survey. The jobless rate probably rose to 9.5
percent from 9.4 percent in December.  The pace of job and employment growth will have to pick up
further to bring down unemployment. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg last month projected the jobless rate will average 9.3
percent this year, compared with 9.6 percent in 2010 and 9.3
percent in 2009.  The economy accelerated at the end of 2010 as  consumer
spending  climbed by the most in more than four years. Gross
domestic product grew at a 3.2 percent annual rate, Commerce
Department figures showed Jan. 28.  Ford and  Norfolk Southern Corp . are among companies
planning to increase payrolls this year. The Dearborn, Michigan-
based automaker plans to hire more than 7,000 workers in the
next two years, including engineers with expertise in battery-
powered cars,  Mark Truby , a company spokesman, said in an
interview in  Detroit  on Jan. 10.  “Our service levels have improved and we’re continuing our
targeted hiring and bringing on new locomotives in anticipation
of future growth,” Charles Moorman, chief executive officer at
Norfolk Southern, said on a Jan. 25 teleconference. “Looking
ahead to 2011, we expect to handle increased business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
