Copper advanced to records in  London 
and  New York  as manufacturing improved from China to the U.S.,
boosting the demand outlook for the metal used in construction
and electrical applications.  Three-month delivery copper added as much as 0.5 percent to
$9,993 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at
$9,973 by 4:10 p.m. Tokyo time. Copper for March delivery rose
as much as 0.8 percent to $4.58 a pound on the Comex in New York
before trading at $4.5515.  “Copper will soon test the $10,000 barrier to move
higher,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at Tokyo-based broker
Fujitomi Co. Given the economic recovery, fundamentals are
supporting the price, he said.  Xstrata Plc said copper may see short-term gains as Cyclone
Yasi crimps supply from mines in  Australia ’s Queensland state.  “I think there probably will be some short-term increases
in prices obviously because of supply,” Xstrata Mount Isa Mines
Chief Operating Officer Steve de Kruijff said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television. The company closed its Mount Isa copper
and zinc operations today.  The world may be short of 822,000 tons of copper in 2011,
more than double last year’s deficit, according to Barclays
Capital. Macquarie expects a 550,000-ton shortage, while the
International Copper Study Group projects a gap of 435,000 tons.  LME Stockpiles  LME copper stockpiles, up 4.3 percent this year, fell by
150 tons to 393,775 tons yesterday, daily exchange figures
showed. Orders to draw copper from LME stocks, or canceled
warrants, fell 4.6 percent to 13,875 tons, the lowest level
since April 15.  “We are bullish and daily momentum studies are
constructive,”  Barclays Capital  said yesterday in a technical
report. “Our initial target through $10,000 is at $10,467, a
long-term equality objective measured off the 2001-2008 rally.”  U.S. service industries, which make up about 90 percent of
the economy and include financial firms, retailers and business
consultants, are growing at the fastest pace since May 2006, a
report may show today. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s
non-manufacturing gauge for January matched December’s reading
of 57.1, economists projected in a Bloomberg survey. A reading
greater than 50 signals growth.  Manufacturing in the U.S. unexpectedly accelerated in
January at the fastest pace in more than six years, figures
showed this week. European manufacturing gained at the quickest
rate in nine months and U.K. production increased at a record
pace in January.  In China, a purchasing managers’ index exceeded the 50
level dividing expansion and contraction, while Indian
manufacturing growth accelerated in January. Markets in mainland  China  and  Taiwan  are closed until next week for the Chinese
Lunar New Year holiday.  Aluminum for three-month delivery was up 0.4 percent at
$2,535 a ton and lead slipped 0.2 percent to $2,559 a ton. Zinc
gained 0.5 percent to $2,488 a ton and nickel fell 0.1 percent
to $27,965 a ton. Tin was down 0.1 percent at $30,616 a ton
after reaching a record $30,790 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
