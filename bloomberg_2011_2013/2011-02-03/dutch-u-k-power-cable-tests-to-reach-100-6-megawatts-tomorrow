Initial tests to send electricity
from the Netherlands to the U.K. via a new 1,000-megawatt cable
were completed successfully, the link’s operator said today.
Trials will resume tomorrow before flows are reversed next week.  Tests began on Feb. 1, flowing as much as 50 megawatts of
power to Britain, and will be stepped up to as much as 100.6
megawatts tomorrow from 2 p.m. through 10:45 p.m. Amsterdam
time, according to an e-mail from  BritNed , the operating company
owned by network managers National Grid Plc of the U.K. and
Tennet Holding BV of the Netherlands.  “The first tests have been completed successfully,” Jelle Wils, a Tennet spokesman, said by telephone. “We’re preparing
to test power flows the other way round sometime next week.”  The Britned cable is scheduled to begin commercial
operations in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
