Mauritaniaâ€™s security forces foiled
an attempt by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb to blow up the
French Embassy in the capital, Nouakchott, and attack military
barracks, Defense Minister Hamadi Ould Hamadi said.  The army shot at a car loaded with  1 1/2 tons of
explosives yesterday, setting off an explosion that killed three
suspected al-Qaeda militants, Hamadi told a press conference
late yesterday in Nouakchott. Eight soldiers were slightly
injured in the operation, he said.  Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attempted attack in
a phone call to an Islamic website, saying they were targeting
President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, the  Associated Press  reported
yesterday.  The car was one of three that entered the country from  Mali , Hamadi said. Security forces detained one of the cars
filled with explosives 200 kilometers (124 miles) to the south
of Nouakchott and arrested its three occupants, Hamadi said.
They are still looking for the third car and its occupants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
