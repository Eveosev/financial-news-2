Treasuries dropped, pushing 30-year
bond yields to a nine-month high, before a nonfarm payrolls
report tomorrow that’s forecast to show the economy added jobs
in January.  Ten-year yields touched the highest level since Dec. 16 as
data today showed the fastest expansion since 2005 last month in  service industries , which account for 90 percent of the  U.S.
economy . Investors are the most bearish in expectations for the
next move in yields after the report than at any time since
2005, according to Royal Bank of  Scotland  Group Plc.  “There are bearish inclinations in the market, and the 30-
year is not immune to it,” said  George Goncalves , head of
interest rate strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., one of 20
primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “The
market’s telling you that tomorrow’s NFP is going to be
stronger.”  The yield on the 30-year bond increased five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.66 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to BGCantor Market Data. It touched 4.67 percent, the
highest level since April 26. The price of the 4.25 percent
security maturing in November 2040 dropped 21/32, or $6.56 per
$1,000 face amount, to 93 11/32.  Yields on the benchmark 10-year note climbed seven basis
points to 3.55 percent, the highest since Dec. 16. Two-year note
yields touched 0.72 percent, the highest since Jan. 5.  Fed Purchase  The Fed purchased $8.9 billion of Treasuries due between
November 2016 and January 2018 as part of a $600 billion bond-
buying program in a strategy called quantitative easing aimed at
spurring economic growth. The amount was 37.7 percent of the
securities that holders offered, compared with an average of
29.6 percent at the past 10 acquisitions.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a speech today in  Washington  the U.S. needs to see faster job growth for a
sufficient time before policy makers can be assured the economic
recovery has taken hold. Dallas Fed Bank President Richard W. Fisher said in an interview an improving economy may mean
further quantitative easing won’t be needed.  A gauge of trader expectations for annual consumer-price
moves over the next decade, the yield difference between U.S.
10-year notes and inflation-indexed securities, was at 2.33
percentage points, compared with 2010’s low of 1.47 percentage
points in August.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses rose to 59.4, from December’s 57.1, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. The median prediction of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was 57.2. The services
index averaged 56.1 in the five years to December 2007.  Payrolls Forecast  U.S. payrolls increased by 146,000 last month, after a
103,000-job gain in December, according to economists surveyed
by Bloomberg before the Labor Department report tomorrow. The
data may also show the  unemployment rate  increased to 9.5
percent from 9.4 percent, according to the surveys.  Seventy-one percent of respondents in a survey by primary
dealer Royal Bank of Scotland expect the next 25 basis-point
move in yields to be higher, versus 15 percent who expect it to
be lower, the firm said today in a note to clients. That would
make it the most bearish response since RBS began polling
investors in 2005, the firm said.  William O’Donnell  and  John
Briggs , interest-rate strategists, didn’t return calls for
further comment.  Payrolls ‘the Key’  “While it is known in the market that jobs are a lagging
indicator,  market psychology  would argue that improvement in
this sector would do a lot for growth,” said  Kevin Giddis ,
president of fixed-income capital markets at the brokerage firm
Morgan Keegan Inc. in Memphis,  Tennessee . “Tomorrow’s numbers
are the key.”  Applications for jobless benefits fell by 42,000 to 415,000
in the week ended Jan. 29, Labor Department data showed today.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast a fall to 420,000.  Bernanke, speaking at the  National Press Club , said
economic growth hasn’t been fast enough to generate significant
improvement in the labor market.  “Until we see a sustained period of stronger  job creation ,
we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established,” the
57-year-old Fed chief said.  While Bernanke said growth will pick up this year and the
Fed’s purchases of Treasuries are “providing significant
support to job creation and the economy,” he gave no indication
whether he’ll maintain or adjust monetary stimulus after the
asset buying-program ends in June. Bernanke has held the
benchmark interest rate near zero since December 2008.  Fisher on Purchases  Fisher of the Dallas Fed said he’s not inclined to back
more quantitative easing after the bond-purchase program
concludes in June.  “You can never say never, but I cannot imagine a
convincing argument for further quantitative easing after this
round, given what is developing now in the economy,” the 61-
year-old regional bank chief said on Bloomberg Radio’s “The
Hays Advantage” with  Kathleen Hays .  Policy makers have the tools to exit quantitative easing
when appropriate, Bernanke said. He repeated a call for Congress
to come up with a plan to control the federal  budget deficit .  Treasuries have lost 0.54 percent this year, after
returning 5.88 percent in 2010, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch Treasury Master index. U.S. corporate securities
have dropped 0.19 percent this year, after gaining 9.52 percent
last year, another Merrill index showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
