Asian companies including Samsung
Electronics Co.,  Hyundai Motor Co . and Nippon Yusen K.K. boosted
earnings last quarter as economic growth in the U.S. and China
spurred consumers to buy more electronics and cars.  Samsung, the world’s second-largest maker of mobile phones,
raised net income in the three months ended Dec. 31 by 13
percent from a year earlier, it said Jan. 28. Profit at Hyundai,  South Korea ’s largest carmaker, jumped 48 percent to a record,
while earnings surged 10-fold at Nippon Yusen, Japan’s largest
shipping line, the companies reported separately.  Spending by U.S. consumers climbed the most in more than
four years in the quarter, helping Asian manufacturers sell more
goods in the world’s largest economy, while economic expansion
accelerated in China.  Canon Inc . and Honda Motor Co. projected
rising sales and profits as demand for cameras and cars
rebounds.  “Our profitability is getting close to where we were
before Lehman collapsed,” Yoichi Hojo, Honda’s chief financial
officer, said in a Feb. 2 interview, referring to the 2008
financial crisis that felled Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and
led to a global recession. The Tokyo-based carmaker, Japan’s
third-largest, raised its full-year profit forecast on Jan. 31.  Rising incomes and a payroll tax cut may help sustain
higher U.S. consumer spending in 2011.  China’s economy ,
estimated to have surpassed Japan as the world’s second-largest
last year, may grow 8.7 percent this year after expanding 10
percent in 2010, the  World Bank  said Jan. 12.  ‘Recovery Trend’  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.7 percent as of 4:47
p.m. Tokyo time, bringing its gain this year to 1.7 percent.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1.1 percent and
is up 3.1 percent in 2011.  Asian earnings reports “confirm a recovery trend is
continuing,” said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer at
Myojo Asset Management Japan Co., a Tokyo-based hedge fund
advisory firm.  Samsung’s net income of 3.42 trillion won ($3.1 billion)
last quarter exceeded analyst estimates and was boosted by
demand for the Suwon, South Korea-based company’s smartphones
and tablet computers.  Industrywide sales of smartphones and tablets will probably
grow to about 1 billion units by 2015 from 300 million last
year, according to Meritz Securities Co.  Demand for the gadgets also bolstered earnings at companies
that make semiconductors. The market for NAND  flash memory  chips
used to store data in smartphones, music players and digital
cameras may expand 18 percent this year after climbing 38
percent in 2010, according to IHS Inc.’s ISuppli.  Consumer Electronics  Samsung, the world’s largest maker of NAND memory chips,
said profit from its semiconductor division rose 34 percent last
quarter.  Toshiba Corp ., the second-largest maker of flash
memory, raised its full-year profit forecast 43 percent to 100
billion yen ($1.2 billion) as the Tokyo-based company reported a
fourth straight quarterly profit.  Total shipments of consumer electronics products may rise
2.6 percent to 1.6 billion units in 2011 after climbing 4
percent in 2010,  ISuppli  said Jan. 25. Canon, the world’s
largest camera maker, said Jan. 27 its sales of cameras with
interchangeable lenses may rise 18 percent, driving a projected
26 percent jump in profit this year.  Canon’s net income in 2010 surged 87 percent to 246.6
billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said.    Sony Corp ., Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, reported profit that beat analyst estimates after
earnings from its PlayStation games division doubled and camera
sales rose. Net income fell 8.6 percent to 72.3 billion yen in
the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with the 65.9 billion yen
average of six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Auto Sales  Demand for consumer electronics gained as the  U.S. economy 
expanded at a 3.2 percent annual rate last quarter. The economy
grew 2.9 percent on a full-year basis, the most in five years,
helping automakers as the nation’s vehicle demand rose 11
percent from a 27-year low in 2009.  Passenger-car sales in China, which overtook the U.S. as
the world’s largest vehicle market in 2009, surged 33 percent
last year to 13.8 million as rising affluence and government
stimulus measures increased demand.  Hyundai said Jan. 27 its profit last quarter rose to 1.4
trillion won as the Seoul-based company’s U.S. vehicle sales
jumped 38 percent from a year earlier, while deliveries in  China 
climbed 22 percent.  Honda raised its profit forecast for the year ending March
31 by 6 percent to 530 billion yen, citing the outlook for the
U.S. auto market.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, is
scheduled to report earnings Feb. 8.  Growing demand for goods from Asia is also boosting
container-shipping rates, benefiting Nippon Yusen and China
Cosco Holdings Co.  Nippon Yusen’s profit for the three months ended Dec. 31
jumped to 26.9 billion yen as rates for transporting goods by
container to the U.S. and  Europe  rose, it said Jan. 31.  China Cosco, China’s biggest shipping line, expects to post
a 2010 profit, rebounding from a loss in 2009, the Tianjin-based
company said Jan. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
