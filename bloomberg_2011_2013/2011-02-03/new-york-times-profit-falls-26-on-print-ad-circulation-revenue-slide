  New York Times Co ., publisher of the
namesake newspaper, dropped as much as 5.9 percent after
reporting a 26 percent decline in profit as print advertising
and circulation revenue continued to shrink.  Fourth-quarter net income fell to $67.1 million, or 44
cents a share, from $90.9 million, or 61 cents, a year earlier,
the company said in a statement today. Revenue slid 2.9 percent
to $661.7 million, compared with the $666 million average
analyst estimate, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “Revenues were a little lower than expectations,” Alexia S. Quadrani, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a
report. “Upside came from lower expenses where New York Times
continues to do a great job managing costs.”  Times Co., based in New York, fell 22 cents to $10.52 at
12:47 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock had dropped as low as $10.11 for the largest intraday
decline since Sept. 22.  “The year did prove more challenging as it progressed,”
chief executive officer Janet Robinson said on a conference call
with investors.  In addition to cutting costs, Robinson is preparing to
start charging readers for New York Times’ content online this
quarter. A paid online subscription is expected to cost less
than $20 per month for full access to all New York Times
content, according to a person familiar with the matter. The
Times has said it will continue to allow limited free access to
stories once the paid model goes into effect.  Robinson didn’t provide an exact date for implementation of
the paid model. The company will release details on pay rates in
“the near future” and will start charging online visitors
“soon,” she said.  Advertising, Circulation  Excluding costs such as severance expenses, profit was 46
cents a share, compared with a 35-cent profit projected by
analysts. Operating costs, excluding depreciation, amortization
and severance, decreased 1.8 percent to $515.2 million.  Ad revenue for the quarter declined 3.1 percent to $385.8
million, and circulation revenue fell 3.6 percent to $230.7
million, the company said. Digital advertising revenue for the
News Media Group, which includes the New York Times website,
increased 20 percent to $67.5 million, helping total digital ad
revenue climb 11.1 percent to $100.6 million.  Revenue for the year declined 1.9 percent to $2.39 billion,
the fourth straight annual decline as readers increasingly seek
their news from the Web.  To contact the reporter on this story:
