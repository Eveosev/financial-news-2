U.S. Gulf crude premiums widened as
the price for benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell after at
least one refinery that draws from Cushing, Oklahoma, slowed
processing rates.    Valero Energy Corp . reduced rates at its 170,000-barrel-a-
day McKee refinery in Texas after issues with crude supply from
a pipeline, Bill Day, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  ConocoPhillips  reduced processing rates Feb. 1 at its Borger
refinery in the Texas Panhandle because of subfreezing
temperatures, two people familiar with refinery operations said
yesterday.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI increased 25 cents
to $12 a barrel at 12:13 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium widened
50 cents to $13 a barrel.  Mars Blend’s premium strengthened 25 cents to $7 a barrel,
while Poseidon’s premium gained 30 cents to $6.90. Southern
Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $5.50. Thunder Horse’s
premium to WTI widened 40 cents to $10.25. West Texas Sour’s
discount widened 10 cents to $5.10.  The premium for Syncrude widened 30 cents to $4.50 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in Alberta. The discount for Western Canada
Select was unchanged at $25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
