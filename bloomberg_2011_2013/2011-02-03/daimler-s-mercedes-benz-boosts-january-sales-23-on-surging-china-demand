  Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-Benz brand, the
world’s second-largest maker of luxury cars, said January sales
advanced 23 percent as Chinese consumers snatched up more autos.  Mercedes deliveries rose to 82,700 vehicles from 67,000 a
year earlier, the Stuttgart, Germany-based carmaker said in an
e-mailed statement today. Mercedes-Benz’s China deliveries
surged 87 percent to 15,600.  “We will be building on this excellent start in the coming
weeks and expect significant sales growth in the first
quarter,” sales chief Joachim Schmidt said in the statement.
“We have ambitious plans for 2011: Our goal is to surpass the
sales record set in 2007 and achieve the best year in the
company’s history.”  Daimler,  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and  Volkswagen AG ’s
Audi, the world’s three biggest makers of luxury cars, last
month forecast record sales in 2011, driven by vehicles such as
BMW’s 5-Series, Mercedes’ top-of-the-line S-Class and Audi’s A8
flagship sedan.  BMW, the maker of Mini and Rolls-Royce models, said Jan. 10
deliveries would exceed 1.5 million vehicles this year from 1.46
million in 2010. Audi is aiming to sell 1.2 million cars and
sport-utility vehicles, up from 1.09 million. Mercedes expects
record sales after delivering 1.17 million cars last year.  Including the Smart small-car unit, Daimler’s registrations
last month gained 23 percent to 89,400. Deliveries for the Smart
city car climbed 20 percent to 6,700.  To contact the reporters on this story:
