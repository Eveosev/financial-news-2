Most European stocks dropped as
gunfire erupted in the middle of Cairo and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. Japanese
shares slid, while U.S. futures fluctuated.  Shell slumped 3.8 percent after saying earnings from its
refining division remained “under pressure” last quarter.
Total SA lost 1.6 percent as its Yemen LNG venture said that
production continued at full capacity even as protesters held a
“Day of Rage” against the country’s president.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index added less than 0.1
percent to 284.69 at 2:10 p.m. in  London  after earlier dropping
as much as 0.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
