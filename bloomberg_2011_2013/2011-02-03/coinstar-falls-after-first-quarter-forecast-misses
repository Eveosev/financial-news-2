  Coinstar Inc ., operator of the Redbox
DVD rental machines, fell as much as 11 percent in extended
trading after the company’s forecast for first-quarter profit
missed analysts’ estimates.  Coinstar tumbled $3.99, or 9 percent, after the
announcement and dropped as low as $39.25. The stock gained
$1.20 to $44.24 in regular Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  The company bought too many DVDs in the fourth quarter that
underperformed, a cost that will carry into the current period,
and is now refining how to gauge demand, Chief Financial Officer
Scott Di Valerio said today on a call. The forecast marks the
second-straight shortfall. Coinstar’s Jan. 13 report of a
fourth-quarter miss triggered a 27 percent drop in the shares.  “The processes that we have put in place, we believe, will
get us into a spot where we are buying at the right levels and
driving the right levels of demand,” Di Valerio said.  Profit from continuing operations will be 15 cents to 25
cents a share, Bellevue, Washington-based Coinstar said today in
a statement. Analysts predict 60 cents, the average of seven
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  First-quarter sales will be $400 million to $420 million,
Coinstar said. Analysts project revenue of $405.7 million, the
average of 11 estimates.  Fourth-quarter net income more than tripled to $11.7
million, or 35 cents a share, from $3.36 million, or 11 cents, a
year earlier. Sales increased 31 percent to $390.8 million.
Excluding some items, profit was 68 cents, compared with the
recently lowered average estimate of 67 cents from 9 analysts.
They predicted sales of $391.3 million.  When Coinstar announced preliminary results last month, the
company cited difficulties adjusting purchases to account for a
28-day delay in receiving the latest DVDs from Hollywood. The
move gave studios more time to sell movies before offering them
for rent.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael White  in  Los Angeles  at
