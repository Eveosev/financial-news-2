  RWE AG  Chief Executive Officer
Juergen Grossmann wants renewable-energy subsidy laws to be
harmonized across Europe,  Handelsblatt  reported.  More efficient laws would help the region reach climate-
protection goals while safeguarding electricity supply, the CEO
wrote in a commentary in the newspaper. Approval procedures for
sites that generate energy from wind, solar, water and biomass
should also be streamlined, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
