European stocks dropped as gunfire
erupted in the middle of Cairo and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. Japanese
shares dropped, while U.S. futures fluctuated.  Shell slumped 2.8 percent after saying earnings from its
refining division remained “under pressure” last quarter.
Total SA lost 1.3 percent as its Yemen LNG venture said that
production continued at full capacity even as protesters held a
“Day of Rage” against the country’s president.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.3 percent to
283.77 at 11:42 a.m. in  London  after earlier swinging between
gains and losses at least 10 times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
