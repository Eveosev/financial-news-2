European front-month gasoil crack
spreads, the premium to  Brent crude , widened the most in at
least a month.  Vitol Group sold  jet fuel  cargoes to BP Plc and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc. Gunvor International BV sold a naphtha cargo to
Glencore International AG, marking the third naphtha cargo deal
in northwest Europe this week.  Light Products  Gunvor sold 12,500 tons of naphtha to Glencore at $877 a
ton for delivery to Rotterdam, according to a Bloomberg survey
of brokers and traders monitoring the Platts pricing window.  Naphtha cargo deals were done yesterday and on Feb. 1 at
$867 and $858 respectively, also for delivery to Rotterdam.
Gunvor bought from Royal Dutch Shell Plc on Feb. 1.  The front-month gasoline crack narrowed as U.S. stockpiles
rose, potentially reducing the need for imports from  Europe . The
crack narrowed to $3.25 a barrel from $3.50 yesterday, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd. data on Bloomberg. That’s the least
since Nov. 16.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose 6.15 million barrels to 236.2
million in the week to Jan. 28, according to the  Department of
Energy . That’s the biggest weekly gain since January 2009.  Demand for the motor fuel is “very poor” because of high
prices and bad weather, Christophe Barret, a London-based oil
analyst at Credit Agricole CIB, wrote in a report. High prices
are “starting to discourage transport demand,” he said.  Gasoline traded from $865 to $876 a metric ton, according
to a Bloomberg survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board and Platts. Prices for the Eurobob grade
fuel, to which ethanol is added before being sold to motorists,
were little changed from yesterday.  BP Plc and Morgan Stanley were the main sellers for Eurobob
for a second day on the barge market, where lots are usually
1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Premium gasoline was little changed at $890 a ton.  Middle Distillates  Vitol sold jet fuel to Shell at a premium of $88 to the
February ICE gasoil contract for delivery to  Le Havre , the
Platts survey showed.  It also sold 30,000 tons of jet fuel to BP at a premium of
$89 to February gasoil for delivery to the same French port.  Jet fuel barge deals were done at premiums from $79 to $80
to the February ICE gasoil contract, the survey showed. BP was
among the sellers while Morgan Stanley bought fuel.  The front-month gasoil crack widened to more than $14 a
barrel today, the highest in at least a month. The spread was at
$13.67 at 4:30 p.m. London time yesterday and $13.09 on Feb. 1.
A crack spread is a measure of profitability for refiners.  Gasoil for February delivery added as much as $7.75, or 0.9
percent, to $865.75 a ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe, the
most since October 2008. The contract traded at $858.50 as of
4:30 p.m. local time.  Gasoil barges were little changed, trading at discounts
from $5.50 to $6 to February ICE gasoil, the survey showed. That
compares with yesterday’s discounts from $5 to $6.  Diesel barges traded at premiums from $20 to $22 to the
February ICE contract, the survey showed. That compares with a
$20 premium yesterday.  Residues  Low-sulfur fuel oil, used in shipping and in some power
stations, traded from $553 a ton to $554 a ton, the survey
showed. High-sulfur  fuel oil , which is more polluting, traded
from $542.25 to $544.  Refinery News  Royal Dutch Shell Plc expects to return a catalytic
cracking unit at its Pernis refinery in the Netherlands to
service at the end of February, its Chief Financial Officer
Simon Henry said. The unit was shut in the fourth quarter
because of technical issues, he said.    Petroplus Holdings AG , Europe’s largest independent
refiner, plans to process an average of 570,000 barrels of oil a
day at its plants in the first quarter, lower than the expected
average for 2011.  The biggest shortfall will come at its Ingolstadt refinery
in  Germany , the Zug, Switzerland-based company said today in a
 presentation  on its website. The refiner plans to shut
Ingolstadt in the spring for maintenance, Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Paul Vettier said in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
