Natural gas futures declined for the
second day in three after a government report showed that U.S.
stockpiles didn’t drop enough to erase a surplus as forecasts
indicated milder weather.    Gas prices  slipped 2.1 percent after the Energy Department
report showed that inventories fell 189 billion cubic feet in
the week ended Jan. 28 to 2.353 trillion. Supplies would have
had to tumble by 195 billion to leave stockpiles below the five-
year average. Mild weather is forecast for mid-February,
crimping demand for the heating fuel.  “It was a good-sized number, but not over the
psychologically important level of 200 billion,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF Advisors in Houston. “We
still have very solid supplies, and we’re likely to see a
significant warm-up in weather at the end of the 15-day
period.”  Natural gas for March delivery fell 9.2 cents to settle at
$4.337 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures are down 20 percent from a year
ago.  The stockpile decrease was bigger than the five-year
average withdrawal for the week of 165 billion cubic feet,
department data show. The surplus to the five-year average fell
to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent the previous week. Supplies were
2.8 percent below year-earlier levels compared with a surplus a
week earlier.  Mild Weather  Warmer-than-normal weather is likely in the Northeast and
Midwest from Feb. 13 through Feb. 17, according to Commodity
Weather Group in Bethesda,  Maryland . Above-normal temperatures
would reduce demand for natural gas for heating.  The low temperature in New York on Feb. 15 may be 33
degrees Fahrenheit (1 Celsius), 5 degrees above normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
The low in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , may be 24 degrees, 1 degree
above normal.  “A transition to a warmer pattern will develop Feb. 12
through 16 with much of the nation from the Southwest to the
Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic states warmer than normal,” said  Joe Bastardi , chief long-range forecaster for AccuWeather, in a
note to clients today.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gross gas production climbed to 76.05 billion cubic feet a
day from a revised 75.25 billion in October, the Energy
Department’s Energy Information Administration said Jan. 28 in a
monthly report known as EIA-914.  Gas Production  Output in the lower 48 states rose 1.1 percent to 66.52
billion cubic feet a day from a revised 65.81 billion.  The number of natural gas rigs operating in the U.S.
advanced for a second week last week, rising by seven to 913,
Baker Hughes Inc. said Jan. 28.  The number of Americans filing first-time claims for  unemployment insurance  fell last week, led by southern states
that were affected by storms in prior weeks, the Labor
Department reported today. Some gas traders monitor economic
data for signs of an accelerated recovery that would boost fuel
demand.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 42,000 to
415,000 in the week ended Jan. 29, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists forecast claims would fall to 420,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
273,353 as of 2:44 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 290,000. Volume was 270,638 yesterday. Open interest was
835,128 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
793,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
