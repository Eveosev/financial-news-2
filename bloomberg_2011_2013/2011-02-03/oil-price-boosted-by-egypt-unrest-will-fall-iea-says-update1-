Oil prices, pushed higher by
political unrest in  Egypt , will fall because the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries can increase supply by using spare
capacity, the International Energy Agency said.  “Hopefully, the crisis in Egypt will sort out, and the
markets will relax,” Richard Jones, deputy executive director
of the agency, told reporters today in  Washington . “We don’t
expect the prices will stay at this level.”  Oil for March delivery fell 27 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$90.59 a barrel at 1:05 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Brent crude for March settlement fell 31 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $102.03 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Oil climbed as much as 1.3 percent today as protests in
Egypt turned violent, prompting concern that unrest may spread
across the Middle East and disrupt supplies. Clashes broke out
between anti-government protesters and supporters of President  Hosni Mubarak  in Cairo.  High oil stocks in Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development nations also suggest prices will remain at the
current level, Jones said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
