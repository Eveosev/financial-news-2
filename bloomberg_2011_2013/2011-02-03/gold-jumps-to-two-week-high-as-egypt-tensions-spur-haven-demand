Gold and silver futures jumped to
two-week highs as the mounting conflict in  Egypt  boosted demand
for the precious metals as a haven.  Gunfire erupted in Cairo’s Tahrir Square after supporters
of President  Hosni Mubarak  battled with demonstrators. The
Muslim Brotherhood movement said the country’s parliament has
the right to review the peace treaty with Israel. The group
denied calling to revoke the accord. In Yemen, tens of thousands
of pro- and anti-government protesters flooded the capital.  “The fact that protests are spreading suggests that they
are feeding each other, which could lead to 2011 being the year
of the Middle East revolution,” Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF
Global Holdings Ltd. in  Chicago , said in a report. “Increasing
tension between these new governments and Israel may keep metal
prices elevated on safe-haven demand.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $20.90, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $1,353 an ounce at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . Earlier, the price reached $1,356.60, the highest
level for a most-active contract since Jan. 20.  “As things in Egypt begin to degrade, we’ll see a flight-
to-quality bid for gold,” said Frank McGhee, the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago.  Last month, gold slumped 6.1 percent, the biggest drop to
start the year since 1997, as a worldwide equity rally eroded
demand for the metal as an alternative investment. In 2010, the
price jumped 30 percent, the 10th straight annual gain, as Greece
and Ireland got bailouts and borrowing costs remained low.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 43.9 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $28.728 an ounce. In trading after the settlement,
the price reached $28.98, the highest since Jan. 19.  Platinum futures for April delivery climbed $15.50, or 0.8
percent, to $1,844.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Palladium futures for March delivery rose $10, or 1.2
percent, to $820.55 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
