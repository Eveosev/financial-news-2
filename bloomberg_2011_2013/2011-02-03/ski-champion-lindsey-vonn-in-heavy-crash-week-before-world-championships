Olympic downhill champion  Lindsey Vonn  has avoided a major injury after she fell on her head
during a training run in  Austria , six days before the start of
the  alpine world championships  in Germany.  Vonn had a “a pretty scary crash” yesterday during a
training giant-slalom run in Hinterreit, Austria, the American
said on her  Facebook page . “I hit my head pretty hard and had
to go to the hospital to get a CT scan. Luckily the scan showed
no major injuries.”  A video posted on her Facebook page shows Vonn losing her
balance on a gate, falling down the slope on her back and then
lying motionless.  Vonn is the defending super-G and downhill champion at the
alpine world championships, which start Feb. 7 in Garmisch-
Partenkirchen,  Germany . The women’s super-G is scheduled for
Feb. 8 and the women’s downhill for Feb. 13.  Yesterday’s fall isn’t Vonn’s first crash of the season.
She sprained a ligament in her left knee as she recovered from a
mistake during the downhill race in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy
last month, where she still finished third.  “I will be very sore tomorrow but should be fine in a few
days,” she said. Vonn added she would “play it by ear”
whether she would race in this weekend’s giant slalom and slalom
World Cup races in Arber-Zwiesel, Germany. Vonn is trailing
Germany’s Maria Riesch in the overall standings for the  World
Cup .  To contact the reporter on this story:
