The number of Americans filing first-
time claims for  unemployment insurance  fell last week, led by
southern states that were affected by storms in prior weeks.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 42,000 to
415,000 in the week ended Jan. 29, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists forecast claims would fall to 420,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
total number of people receiving unemployment insurance and
those collecting extended payments decreased.  Companies, which are holding on to more workers as sales
improve, may soon find they need to bolster payrolls to keep up
with demand. A Labor Department report tomorrow may show
employers last month added the most workers since October,
according to economists’ forecasts.  “Job growth has certainly improved from where it was a
year ago,” said  Stephen Stanley , chief economist at Pierpont
Securities LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , who correctly forecast
the level of claims. “Now we’re waiting to see significant
acceleration in job growth. But it will take time.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg News survey of 52 economists
ranged from 354,000 to 442,000. The Labor Department revised the
prior week’s figure to 457,000 from an initially reported
454,000 claims.  Stock Index Futures  Stock-index futures held earlier losses as oil advanced
after protests in  Egypt  turned violent. The March contract on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.2 percent to 1,297.5
at 8:55 a.m. in  New York . Treasuries fell, pushing up the yield
on the benchmark 10-year note to 3.51 percent from 3.48 percent
late yesterday.  Another Labor Department report showed worker productivity
unexpectedly rose at a faster rate in the fourth quarter of 2010
as employers tried to control costs. The measure of employee
output per hour climbed at a 2.6 percent annual rate, compared
with a 2.4 percent gain in the previous three months. Labor
expenses dropped at a 0.6 percent annual pace.  The number of applications rose by 10,335 in  Georgia , by
6,048 in  North Carolina  and by 3,299 in  South Carolina  two weeks
ago, the report showed, which may reflect a rebound from
depressed levels attributed to the influence of bad weather in
prior weeks. Those states led the drop last week, a Labor
Department spokesman said as the data was released to the media.  Four-Week Average  The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure, rose
to 430,500 from 429,500 last week.  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
dropped by 84,000 in the week ended Jan. 22 to 3.93 million.
Figures for continuing claims do not include the number of
workers receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by 68,000
to 4.55 million in the week ended Jan. 15.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits
fell to 3.1 percent.  Forty-six states and territories reported a decrease in
claims, while seven had an increase.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Planned Firings  Reports yesterday pointed to a stabilizing labor market.
Planned firings by U.S. employers dropped in January by 46
percent from the same month last year to 38,519, according to
Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The Chicago-based placement firm
said it marked the fewest job cuts for any January since record-
keeping began in 1993.  Companies added 187,000 workers last month, figures from
ADP Employer Services showed. The median estimate in the
Bloomberg News survey called for a 140,000 gain last month.  Economists estimate the Feb. 4 report from the Labor
Department will show employers probably added 140,000 jobs in
January as the jobless rate rose to 9.5 percent from 9.4 percent
the prior month.  Bad weather may have played a role in depressing payrolls.
A winter storm that spread from the Midwest and the South to  Boston  during the week that covers Labor Department’s employer
survey, which includes the 12th of a month, could reduce January
payrolls by 60,000, economists at UBS Securities LLC in
Stamford, Connecticut.    Federal Reserve   The economy hasn’t improved enough for Federal Reserve
policy makers to withdraw their plans to pull down the
unemployment rate by purchasing $600 billion in  Treasury
securities . Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.2 percent
annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 as  consumer spending 
climbed by the most in more than four years, a Commerce
Department report showed last week.  “The economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate
that has been insufficient to bring about a significant
improvement in labor market conditions,” the central bankers
said in a statement Jan. 26 after their latest meeting. “The
unemployment rate is elevated.”    National Grid Plc , owner of the U.K.’s power and gas
networks, said Jan. 31 it plans to cut 1,200 U.S. jobs to reduce
operating expenses.  “We’re not earning adequate returns,” Chief Executive
Officer Steve Holliday said on a conference call. “Operating
costs are still higher than we’re recovering through today’s
rates, and there is more to do to operate more efficiently.”  To lift employment, President  Barack Obama  signed an
executive order Jan. 31 announcing the creation of an outside
panel of economic advisers tasked with fostering “growth,
competitiveness, innovation, and  job creation .” General
Electric Co.’s chief executive officer,  Jeffrey Immelt , will
lead the council.  The new panel, called the President’s Council on Jobs and
Competitiveness, was established within the Treasury Department
to help ensure “the availability of nonpartisan advice to the
president from participants in and experts on the economy,”
according to the executive order.  To contact the reporters on this story:
