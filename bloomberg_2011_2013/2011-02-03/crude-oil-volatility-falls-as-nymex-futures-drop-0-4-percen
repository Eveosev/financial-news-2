Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures dropped by the smallest amount in two weeks
as the euro tumbled against the dollar, reducing the investment
appeal of commodities.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, fell to 29 percent as of 4 p.m. in New York
from 30.7 percent yesterday. Volatility has increased this week
as protests in  Egypt  prompted concern that unrest may spread to
other parts of the Middle East and disrupt supplies.  Implied volatility of calls allowing the owner of the
option to profit if oil rises more than 25 percent increased to
37.8 percent from 34.9 percent.  Oil for March delivery dropped 32 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
settle at $90.54 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
It was the smallest drop since Jan. 18. Futures are up 18
percent from a year ago.  “The upside call buying that we have been seeing is mostly
a reaction to the situation in the Mideast,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York 
and a trader at the Nymex. “Today there was a lot of buying by
one broker in the May $125 calls, about 10,000 contracts, and in
the June $130 calls, 5,000 contracts. This was most likely
speculation by a hedge fund.”  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  Electronic Trading  March $90 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 2,037 lots changing hands. They dropped 9
cents to $1.52 a barrel. March $100 calls, the next-most active
contract, was unchanged from the day before at 18 cents a barrel
with 1,122 contracts trading. One contract is for 1,000 barrels
of oil.  May $125 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday with 24,828 lots changing hands. They were unchanged
from the day before at 17 cents a barrel. The next-most active
option, September $120 calls, rose 5 cents to $1.86 a barrel on
4,866 contracts.  Open interest in the $250  call option  for December
increased yesterday to 242 from 142 on Feb. 1.  “What we are seeing is similar to people buying a lottery
ticket,” said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc., a
consulting company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .  Open interest was highest yesterday for March $100 calls
with 40,912 contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 39,355
and December $120 calls with 37,366.  To contact the reporter on this story:
