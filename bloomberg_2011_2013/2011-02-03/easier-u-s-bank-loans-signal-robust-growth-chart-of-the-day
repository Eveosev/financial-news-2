U.S. banks are setting the bar for
corporate borrowers low enough to fuel economic expansion this
year, according to Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S.
equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares changes in standards for
commercial and industrial loans to the largest companies, based
on a survey of senior loan officers by the  Federal Reserve , with
the economy’s year-over-year growth rate. Levkovich published a
similar chart yesterday as his “chart of the month.”  Bankers easing loan criteria outnumbered those that are
tightening by 10.5 percentage points in the Fed’s most recent
quarterly survey, released this week. This percentage was the
same in last year’s fourth quarter, the most favorable period
for borrowers since 2006.  Shifts in lending standards tend to precede changes in the
pace of economic growth by about nine months, Levkovich wrote in
a report. For this reason, the chart displays GDP figures with a
nine-month lag.  “GDP should be relatively robust through late this year,”
the report said, as easier access to credit clears the way for
many companies to invest. The expansion outlook represents “an
encouraging backdrop” for gains in stocks, he wrote.  Levkovich sees the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ending the
year at 1,400, amounting to an 11 percent gain for 2011. His
projection matches the median estimate among 13 Wall Street
strategists in a Bloomberg survey.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:  David Wilson  in New York at
