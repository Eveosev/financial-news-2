  Enel SpA , Italy’s biggest energy
company, said gross profit rose 6.7 percent last year to a
record, helped by the sale of energy outside of Italy and the
consolidation of Spain’s  Endesa SA .  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization increased to 17.5 billion euros ($23.9 billion)
from 16.4 billion euros a year earlier, Enel said in a stock-
exchange statement. That beat the 17 billion-euro mean estimate
of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Sales rose 14 percent
to 73.4 billion euros and net debt declined 12 percent to 45
billion euros, matching the company’s pledge.  “Once again in 2010 we fully delivered on our commitments
to investors and exceeded the published targets,” Chief
Executive Officer Fulvio Conti said in the statement.  Enel, which became Europe’s most-indebted power company
after the Endesa purchase, has cut costs and sold assets to
improve its finances. The utility has managed to meet its 2010
debt target even after raising less than forecast in the initial
public offering of renewable energy unit  Enel Green Power SpA  in
November.  Enel serves 61 million customers in 23 countries and
produces 72 percent of its energy outside of Italy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
