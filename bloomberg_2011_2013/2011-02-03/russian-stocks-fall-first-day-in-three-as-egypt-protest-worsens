  Russia ’s  Micex Index  had its best
weekly gain in three as oil traded above $100 a barrel in  London 
amid political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East,
bolstering the earnings outlook for producers.  The 30-stock gauge rose 1 percent to 1,766.53 by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, bringing the week’s advance to 1.8
percent. OAO Rosneft added 1.7 percent after Russia’s largest
oil producer said fourth-quarter profit climbed 79 percent from
the same period a year earlier. OAO Gazprom, the natural-gas
export monopoly, surged 3.2 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index increased 0.6 percent to 1,928.58.  “Investors are really warming up to the oil price and
getting more comfortable at these new levels,” Peter Westin,
chief strategist at Aton Capital in Moscow, said by phone today.
“The risk for Russian equities, and oil names especially, will
be when things normalize in the Middle East.”  Violent street protests in  Egypt  have spurred concern that
shipments through the Suez Canal will be disrupted, sending
North Sea Brent above $100 a barrel for the first time since
October 2008 this week.  Brent crude  for March settlement rose 42
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $102.18 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange after the contract touched $103.37
yesterday.  Stocks extended gains after data showed the jobless rate in
the U.S. unexpectedly dropped last month. Unemployment declined
to 9 percent in January from 9.4 percent in December, the Labor
Department said today in Washington  Russian-focused equity funds saw inflows for the 10th
straight week, taking in $196 million,  Alfa Bank  said, citing
data compiled by EPFR Global, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
research company.  Shares of TNK-BP surged as much 8.8 percent and last traded
3.6 percent higher at 87.59 rubles after the Vedomosti newspaper
reported Rosneft may buy a 50 percent stake in the company from
Russian billionaires. State-run Rosneft denied the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
