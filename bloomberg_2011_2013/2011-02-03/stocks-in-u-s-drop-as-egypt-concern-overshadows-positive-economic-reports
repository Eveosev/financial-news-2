U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lower for a second day, as concern
that unrest in  Egypt  will spread through the region overshadowed
a drop in jobless claims and growth in service industries.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3 percent to
1,300.32 at 10:06 a.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  lost 35.79 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,006.18.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the  U.S. economy , rose to 59. 4 from December’s 57.1, the group said
today. The median forecast of 74 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was 57.2, with estimates ranging from 54.5 to 62.
Readings greater than 50 signal expansion.   The Dow average closed above 12,000 for the first time
since June 2008 this week after U.S. and Chinese manufacturing
expanded and United Parcel Service Inc. beat analysts’ earnings
estimates. About 74 percent of the 265 companies in the S&P 500
that have reported results since Jan. 10 topped earnings-per-
share projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Global stocks fell today as protests against Egyptian
President  Hosni Mubarak ’s 30-year rule intensified. Gunfire
erupted in Cairo’s Tahrir Square today as Mubarak’s supporters
battled with demonstrators demanding an immediate end to his 30-
year rule. Five people have been killed in the clashes and
Molotov cocktails were thrown in the square, Al Jazeera
television reported.  Labor Department figures showed that applications for
jobless benefits decreased by 42,000 to 415,000 in the week
ended Jan. 29. Economists forecast claims would fall to 420,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
total number of people receiving  unemployment insurance  and
those collecting extended payments decreased.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
