News Corp.’s Fox TV network said
  American Idol ” drew 2 percent more viewers last night, the
first time the singing competition gained over last season.  “Idol,” the most-watched show on U.S. TV, attracted 24.9
million viewers last night to auditions in Austin, Texas, Fox
said today in a statement. Last year 24.5 million watched the
auditions.  The show is narrowing viewership declines this season after
Los Angeles-based Fox retooled the program, added judges
Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler, and moved the broadcast to
Wednesday and Thursday nights. This season, “Idol” has shrunk
9 percent in total audience and is down 14 percent among viewers
ages 18 to 49, a group advertisers target, Gaude Paez, a Fox
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  “The show is picking up momentum,” Preston Beckman, who
oversees Fox’s schedule, said today in an interview. “The fans
of ‘Idol’ are embracing the differences and the new sensibility.
Now, it’s up to us to give them a singing competition.”    News Corp ., controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Rupert Murdoch , gained 97 cents, or 6 percent, to $16.96
at 4:30 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The
Class A shares gained 6.4 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
