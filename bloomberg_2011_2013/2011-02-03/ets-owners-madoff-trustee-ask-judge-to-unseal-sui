The owners of the  New York  Mets
baseball team and the trustee overseeing the liquidation of
Bernard Madoff’s former firm said settlement negotiations have
ended, and asked a judge to unseal the trustee’s complaint
against the owners.  The trustee,  Irving Picard , sued Sterling Equities Inc.,
which owns the Mets, along with Mets LP, Mets Chairman Fred Wilpon and chief operating officer  Jeff Wilpon , and almost 100
related parties on Dec. 9. Picard is seeking the return of
profits they allegedly earned in the Madoff fraud.  The complaint was filed under seal to facilitate settlement
negotiations in the case, the trustee and the owners said.
Today, both sides sent letters to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in Manhattan telling him that the talks have ended
amid media disclosure of some of the contents of the complaint.  “The objective of keeping the complaint sealed are no
longer being served, so defendants consent to its immediate
unsealing,” Karen Wagner, a lawyer for the Mets’ owners, said
in her letter.  The case is Picard v. Katz, 10-AP-5287,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
