German  government bonds  stayed higher
as European Central Bank policy makers held their benchmark
interest rate for a 22nd month and investors scaled back bets on
future rate increases.  Spanish bonds fell as demand weakened at an auction of 3.5
billion euros ($4.8 billion) of debt. The yield on the 10-year
bund, Europe’s benchmark government security, retreated after
reaching the highest in almost a year today. The ECB kept its
key rate at a record low 1 percent, as forecast by all 58
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
will speak at a news conference at 2:30 p.m. in  Frankfurt .  “Forthcoming ECB hikes are priced in quite generously at
the moment, so today people may be reconsidering how hawkish the
ECB could possibly be,” said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-
income strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich.  The two-year note yield dropped four basis points to 1.45
percent as of 12:48 p.m. in  London , after earlier reaching 1.5
percent for the first time since Aug. 11, 2009. The price of the
1 percent securities maturing in December 2012 rose 0.065, or 65
euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,378) face amount, to 99.18. The
yield on German 10-year bunds was little changed at 3.25
percent. It reached 3.27 earlier, the highest since Feb. 23.  Two-year yields have gained about 46 basis points since
President Jean-Claude Trichet on Jan. 13 pledged to do what’s
necessary to keep a rein on rising prices, signaling a shift in
focus for the ECB. The euro-area inflation rate rose to 2.4
percent in January, the highest in more than two years.  Retail Sales  “The market sold off aggressively, and since then there’s
been a little bit of backtracking from the ECB,” said  Laurent Fransolet , head of European fixed-income strategy at  Barclays
Capital . “Maybe they were a little bit surprised at how quickly
the market interpreted they would be willing to move rates. I
wouldn’t be surprised if there is a market rally afterwards if
he is actually not more hawkish than last time.”  European retail sales slipped 0.6 percent in December from
November, when they dropped 0.3 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had
forecast a 0.5 percent increase. Sales dropped 0.9 percent from
a year earlier.  Greek 10-year bonds slid, pushing the yield up seven basis
points to 10.88 percent. The extra yield investors demand to
hold 10-year Greek government bonds instead of their German
counterparts shrank 11 basis points to 763 basis points. Italian
debt of similar maturity also declined, with yields rising five
basis points to 4.59 percent.  French Disagreement  Bonds in  Europe ’s higher-deficit nations gained as divisions
over rescue measures shook investor confidence.  France is “not in full agreement” with  Germany  on the
future of the European Financial Stability Facility, a French
government official said in Paris today. The nation favors bond
purchases by the EFSF on the primary or secondary market and
also backs allowing the bailout mechanism to fund bond buybacks
by debt-laden governments, he said.  “Markets have been betting very heavily on a resolution of
the debt crisis in March when the European leaders come
together,” Daheim said. “People are starting to wonder whether
these expectations are warranted, or whether there might be
scope for negative surprise that the EU does not deliver a
straightforward solution to the debt problems of peripheral
countries.”  Spanish Auction    Spain ’s borrowing costs dropped as the nation auctioned
debt maturing in 2013 and 2016. Demand for the three-year paper
was 1.95 times the amount sold, compared with 2.27 at the last
auction. The bid-to-cover ratio for the five-year notes was
1.79. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose nine basis points
to 5.19 percent.  The amount sold was “in the middle of the range
announced,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , a fixed-income strategist at
Societe Generale SA in Paris. “This is okay given that yields
have fallen a lot, which reduces appetite. Demand for riskier
assets at the moment is quite strong.”    France  sold bonds due 2016, 2020, 2021 and 2023.  To contact the reporter on this story:
