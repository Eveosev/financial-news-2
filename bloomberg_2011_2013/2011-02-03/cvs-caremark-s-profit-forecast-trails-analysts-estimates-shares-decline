  CVS Caremark Corp ., the largest
provider of  prescription drugs  in the U.S., reported a 2.2
percent decline in fourth-quarter earnings and projected 2011
profit that trailed analystsâ€™ forecasts.  CVS declined the most since June in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading after the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based
company said today that full-year profit excluding some items
will be $2.72 to $2.82 a share. Analysts projected $2.89, the
average of 22 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Revenue fell 4.1 percent to $24.8 billion last quarter,
hurt by a 9.7 percent decline in sales at the pharmacy-benefits
management division after the termination of contracts of some
large clients, CVS said in a statement. Analysts estimated sales
of $25 billion on average.  PBMs make money by negotiating prices with retail
pharmacies and drugmakers and by processing a large number of
claims. They pass most of those savings to corporate, government
and insurance customers.  Fourth-quarter net income fell to $1.03 billion, or 75
cents a share, from $1.05 billion, or 74 cents, a year earlier.
Excluding some items, CVS said profit totaled 80 cents,
exceeding by 1 cent the average estimate of analysts.  CVS sank $1.85, or 5.3 percent, to $32.80 at 10:16 a.m. in
New York trading. The shares dropped to as low as $32.48 for the
biggest intraday decline since June 7. CVS fell less than 1
percent this year through yesterday, after advancing 8 percent
in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Chris Burritt  in Greensboro,  North Carolina ,
