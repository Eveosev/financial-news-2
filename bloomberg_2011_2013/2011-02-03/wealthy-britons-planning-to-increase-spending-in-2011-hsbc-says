Wealthy Britons plan to save less and
spend more on travel, commuting and home improvements,  HSBC
Holdings Plc  said, citing a YouGov Plc survey.  Households with a combined annual income of more than
100,000 pounds ($162,080) will probably increase spending by 7.8
percent in 2011, the London-based bank said in an e-mailed
report today. The amount they save may drop 10 percent, while
transport and travel expenditure may surge 65 percent. The
biggest cutbacks include spending on horses and pets, beauty
treatments and weddings.  The U.K.’s highest earners have faced higher taxes as Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s government seeks to tackle a record
budget deficit. It has added to the previous Labour government’s
squeeze on top-rate taxpayers by raising the capital-gains levy
and limiting pension contributions. That’s on top of maintaining
a 50 percent income-tax rate on earnings above 150,000 pounds.  “It seems saving is giving way to spending for many
affluent households in 2011,”  Richard Brown , Head of Savings
and Investments at HSBC, said in the report. “It will remain to
be seen as the year progresses if this is indeed the case and
the correct decision.”  The households plan to spend an average of 87,380 pounds
this year compared with 81,060 pounds in 2010, HSBC said.
Spending on “general home improvements” may quadruple, while
expenditure on loft extensions may jump 45 percent, as wealthy
Britons extend current properties instead of moving.  The increase in spending on homes comes as reports show
Britons have become less likely to buy property. Hometrack Ltd.
said on Jan. 27 that  house prices  fell 0.5 percent in December
as demand plunged the most in three years.  Tax Increase  The goods and services that will see the largest cutbacks
among affluent Britons will be luxury and one-off big-ticket
items such as spa and beauty treatments, weddings, birthday
parties, jewellery and wedding gifts, HSBC said.  YouGov surveyed 1,017 adults between Dec. 3 and Dec. 9 for
the report.  A separate report today showed national wage growth
maintained its momentum in the three months through December.
Incomes Data Services said the median pay settlement was 2.2
percent, matching the result for the three months through
November. The data is based on 53 pay settlements affecting
943,485 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Scott Hamilton  in  London  at
