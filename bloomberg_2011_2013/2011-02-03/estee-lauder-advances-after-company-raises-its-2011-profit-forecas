  Estee Lauder  Cos., the maker of Mac
cosmetics and Clinique skin care, jumped the most since October
after raising its fiscal 2011 profit forecast.  The stock climbed $10.90, or 14 percent, to $91.46 at 10:16
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after the
company said today that full-year earnings excluding some
charges will range from $3.40 to $3.60, from an earlier forecast
of as much as $3.10.  New York-based Estee Lauder saw stronger-than-expected
holiday demand during the last quarter, with sales in emerging
markets and at airports leading the gains.  The current quarter will include a restructuring charge of
about $15 million, or 5 cents a share.  Net income in the quarter ended Dec. 31 jumped 34 percent
to $343.9 million, or $1.71 a share, from $256.2 million, or
$1.28, a year earlier, Estee Lauder said. Sales rose 10 percent
to $2.49 billion.  Editors: Robin Ajello, Julie Alnwick  To contact the reporter on this story:
