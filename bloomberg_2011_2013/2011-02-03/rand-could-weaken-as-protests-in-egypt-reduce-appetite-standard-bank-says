  South Africa ’s rand slumped to its
weakest against the dollar in five months after anti-government
protests in Egypt turned violent, damping investors’ appetite
for risk.  The rand depreciated as much as 1.9 percent to 7.3007 per
dollar, the weakest intraday level since Sept. 2, before trading
down 1.7 percent at 7.2900 per dollar as of 6:16 p.m. in
Johannesburg. That was the biggest retreat of more than 20
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Against the
euro the rand declined 0.5 percent to 9.9343.  Gunfire erupted in Cairo’s Tahrir Square early today as
supporters of Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  clashed with
demonstrators demanding an immediate end to his 30-year rule.
Protests also spread to Yemen where opposition groups, inspired
by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, are pressuring President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down before his term ends in 2013.  “The political unrest in Egypt is causing great
uncertainty in the markets,”  Michael Keenan , a Johannesburg-
based currency strategist at  Standard Bank , wrote in a note to
clients today. “We see an increased chance of broad-based  risk
aversion . The risk lies in extended rand weakness.”  The South African currency has lost 3 percent versus the
dollar since protests started in Cairo on Jan. 25 and 9.1
percent so far this year.  South African government bonds fell for a second day, with
the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 losing 49
cents to 121.09 rand. The yield climbed 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 7.94 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
