  BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc . surged the
most in almost three months after saying its board has decided
to explore strategic options, including a possible sale.  The Westborough, Massachusetts-based retailer has hired
Morgan Stanley as its financial adviser, according to a
statement today. The company had a market value of about $2.35
billion as of yesterday’s close.  BJ’s hired the investment bank last year after receiving an
offer from private-equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP,
three people with knowledge of the matter said at the time. The
wholesale club, which offers discounts to members who pay an
annual fee, has lagged behind larger  Costco Wholesale Corp . in
same-store sales growth, a key measure of retail performance.  BJ’s jumped $5.24, or 12 percent, to $48.25 at 4:03 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares increased
46 percent last year.  January sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.3
percent excluding gasoline, BJ’s said today. Costco posted a 4
percent gain at its U.S. stores, excluding fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
