  Blackstone Group LP , the world’s
largest private-equity firm, said fourth-quarter profit rose 56
percent as the value of its real estate investments gained.  Profit, excluding some costs tied to the firm’s 2007
initial public offering, increased to $512.7 million, or 46
cents a share, from $329.4 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier,
New York-based Blackstone said today in a statement. The result
beat the 30-cent average estimate of seven analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The shares rose the most in a month.  Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Schwarzman ’s firm is
benefiting from a rebound in commercial real estate, along with
higher values tied to its leveraged buyout holdings that include
Hilton Worldwide Inc. Blackstone, which Schwarzman created in
1985 with  Peter G. Peterson , posted its seventh straight year-
over-year increase in quarterly profit.  “Conditions continue to remain favorable for private
equity, real estate and alternative asset class investing,”  Howard Chen , a Credit Suisse analyst, wrote in a Feb. 2 note to
clients. Chen reinstated coverage of Blackstone with an
“outperform” rating, saying he expects the shares to reach $20
within a year.  Blackstone rose 69 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $17.36 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after earlier
gaining as much as 7.7 percent. The stock has gained more than
20 percent in the past three months amid a broader recovery in
the economy and the firm’s private-equity business. It’s still
trading below the $31-a-share IPO price.  Assets Rise  Fee-earning assets under management rose to $109.5 billion
from $96.1 billion a year earlier. Real estate assets gained 13
percent to $26.8 billion.  “We are pleased with the improving markets and economic
environment,”  Tony James , Blackstone’s president, said on a
conference call today. “We’re still in the early stages of a
value recovery.”  Blackstone this year plans to begin raising its seventh
real estate fund, which is likely to be similar in size to its
current, sixth fund at about $10 billion, James said.  New money for debt investments in real estate and an
increase in the value of some properties drove the assets
higher, Blackstone said.  Profit in the real estate business surged more than five
times to $280.8 million, according to the statement. The firm’s
funds tied to real estate rose 19 percent in the fourth quarter
and 69 percent in 2010, James said.  Net Loss Narrows  Blackstone had a net loss of $11 million, down from $143.3
million a year earlier. The figure includes costs tied to the
IPO that the firm has told investors may be reflected in losses
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principals for several
years.  Schwarzman, 63, has expanded Blackstone’s fund of hedge
fund business, now part of the firm’s largest unit by assets, as
well as its advisory group, which counsels companies on mergers
and restructuring. Fee-earning assets in the credit and
marketable alternatives unit rose 22 percent to $58.5 billion
last quarter.  The company’s best-known business remains its private
equity unit. Blackstone last year raised about $15 billion for
its sixth buyout fund, less than the record-setting $21.7
billion it collected for its fifth pool in 2007.  Fee-earning assets in private equity dropped 1 percent to
$24.2 billion as Blackstone sold some investments from its
fourth private-equity fund. The firm said the investment period
for Blackstone Capital Partners VI began this quarter.  The firm participated in 35 deals valued at a combined
$11.85 billion in 2010. That’s more than twice the $5.66 billion
in transactions Blackstone was involved in during 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
