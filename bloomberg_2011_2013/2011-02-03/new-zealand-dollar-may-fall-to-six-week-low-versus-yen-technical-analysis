The  New Zealand dollar  may fall to a
six-week low against the yen as trading patterns suggest it’s in
a downtrend, according to Gaitame.Com Research Institute Ltd.  The so-called kiwi is set to drop toward the lower
Bollinger band around 62.65 yen after declining below the 20-day
moving average, said Takuya Kawabata, a researcher at the unit
of Japan’s largest foreign-exchange margin company in Tokyo. The
currency may also fall to the 200-day moving average around
62.55 yen, Kawabata said.  “It seems downward pressure is mounting,” Kawabata said
in an interview with Bloomberg News yesterday. “The kiwi may
decline toward 62.46 yen reached on Jan. 21.”  Should it dip below that level, the currency may fall
further to 61.73 yen reached Dec. 23, Kawabata said.  The New Zealand dollar bought 63.08 yen as of 11:31 a.m. in
Wellington from 63.13 yen in  New York  yesterday.  Bollinger bands are designed to alert investors when a
security rises too high or falls too low by comparing its price
to the average level over the past 20 days. The system of
analysis was created in the 1980s by  John Bollinger . Resistance
refers to an area where sell orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
