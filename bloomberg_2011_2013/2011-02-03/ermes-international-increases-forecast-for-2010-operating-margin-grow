  Hermes International  SCA, the French
maker of Kelly handbags, raised its outlook for operating margin
growth after fourth-quarter sales beat analysts’ estimates and
helped the company surpass its 2010 revenue forecast.  The full-year operating margin will widen by about 3
percentage points, Paris-based Hermes said today in a statement,
lifting a previous forecast for an increase of 1 to 2 points.
Pretax profit will rise by slightly more than 40 percent, the
maker of leather bags and silk scarves said.  Sales for the three months ended Dec. 31 climbed 25 percent
to 736 million euros ($1.02 billion), from 587.3 million euros,
Hermes said. The average estimate of eight analysts compiled by
Bloomberg was 709.4 million euros. Excluding currency moves,
full-year revenue advanced 19 percent to 2.4 billion euros,
beating a November forecast of about 15 percent growth.  Hermes follows  Bulgari SpA ,  Burberry Group Plc , Cie.
Financiere Richemont SA and  Tod’s SpA  in reporting a double-
digit sales increase in the last three months of 2010,
suggesting wealthy consumers are regaining confidence. Luxury
demand may rise by 11 percent in 2011, according to HSBC.  “Hermes has been one of the best top-line performers in
the luxury industry and we expect this to continue in 2011 and
2012,”  Antoine Belge , an analyst at HSBC, wrote in a report
last month.  Hermes will pay a dividend of 1 euro a share on Feb. 10 and
plans to open 10 stores this year, the company said. Net cash
was 830 million euros as of Dec. 31, Hermes said.  Share Performance  Hermes has gained 54 percent in Paris trading in the past
12 months, valuing the company at 15.9 billion euros.    LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA , the world’s largest
luxury-goods maker, announced in October it held a 14.2 percent
stake in Hermes and derivative instruments for another 2.9
percent that it has since exercised. LVMH, which now holds
20.2 percent of the Birkin bag maker, has said it doesn’t intend
to seek a board seat or control.  The full-year sales increase was driven by “extremely
strong business momentum” at the company’s own stores,
particularly during the Christmas season, said Hermes, which
opened 13 branches and renovated or enlarged nine others. U.S.
sales growth was “brisk,” spurred by the first Hermes store
for men on Madison Avenue in  New York , the company said.  Fourth-quarter sales at Hermes’s stores advanced
28 percent, while wholesale revenue climbed 7.6 percent.  Sales of  leather goods  advanced 30 percent in the quarter,
while revenue from silk ties and scarves climbed 25 percent and
apparel and fashion accessories sales jumped 27 percent. Revenue
from watches rose 13 percent, while tableware sales gained 23
percent. Perfume sales fell 3 percent.  Fourth-quarter revenue increased 18 percent in  Europe , led
by France, and 36 percent in the Americas, Hermes said. Sales
jumped 17 percent in Japan and surged 45 percent in the rest of
the Asia-Pacific region.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
