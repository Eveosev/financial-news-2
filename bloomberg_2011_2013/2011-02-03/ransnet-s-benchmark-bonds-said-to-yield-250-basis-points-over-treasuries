Five-year bonds to be sold by South
African railway and pipeline operator Transnet Ltd. may be
priced to yield about 250 basis points more than U.S.
Treasuries, according to two people with knowledge of the sale.  The state-owned company is planning to sell $1 billion of
bonds in international markets to pay for maturing debt and to
fund capital expenditure, including the construction of a 555-
kilometer (344-mile) fuel pipeline between the port of Durban
and Johannesburg,  South Africa ’s industrial hub.  Transnet is currently meeting with investors in the U.S.,
spokesman Mboniso Sigonyela said in a telephone interview. “The
issue of the bond is subject to market conditions,” he said
from Johannesburg.  U.S. five-year Treasuries yielded 2.146 percent at 7:54
a.m. in  New York , according to generic prices on Bloomberg.  Eskom Holdings Ltd., South Africa’s state-owned power
utility, last month sold $1.75 billion of 5.75 percent
securities due in 10 years, which were also priced to yield 250
basis points more than comparable U.S. Treasuries.  Transnet’s new 23.4 billion-rand ($3.2 billion) pipe is to
have a 70-year lifespan and will pump 170 million liters (44.9
million gallons) of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel a week by
2017, covering users’ requirements entirely and eliminating the
need for road transportation, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
