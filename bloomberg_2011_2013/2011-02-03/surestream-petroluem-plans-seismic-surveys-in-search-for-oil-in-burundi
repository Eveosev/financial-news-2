Surestream Petroleum Ltd., the
closely held U.K.-based explorer searching for oil in Burundi,
will begin seismic surveys of its two oil blocks in the East
African country in June, a company official said.  Surestream has been exploring for oil for the past two
years and is “almost” ready to start identifying locations for
drilling, Ildephonse Rurimirije, director general of the
company’s Burundian unit, said in an interview at a conference
today in Kampala, capital of neighboring  Uganda .  The company owns Block D in southern Burundi and Block B in
the central region, each covering 700 square kilometers (270
square miles), he said.  Surestream’s other operations in  Africa  are in  Mozambique ,
Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rurimirije said.  Burundi ’s remaining two oil blocks will be awarded “soon”
after the Cabinet has completed analysis of bids, Damien
Riragonya, an official in the Energy Ministry, said in a
separate interview today. He didn’t identify the bidders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
