Gasoline advanced after reports
showed a drop in jobless claims and growth for U.S.  service
industries , indicating improvements in the economy and better
prospects for fuel demand.  Gasoline outperformed crude and heating oil as the Labor
Department reported a drop in first-time filings for jobless
benefits and continuing claims. Service industries in the U.S.
expanded in January at the fastest pace since August 2005,
indicating the recovery is broadening.  “Continued good economic news portents good product demand
going forward,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for March delivery added 0.49 cent to settle at
$2.5034 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The

cents to $14.60 a barrel.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses rose to 59.4, exceeding the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, after December’s 57.1.
Readings above 50 signal expansion in the gauge that covers
about 90 percent of the economy. Orders were the highest in
seven years, while companies showed more confidence to hire.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 42,000 to
415,000 in the week ended Jan. 29. Economists forecast claims

percent, to settle at $2.7674, after touching $2.804, the
