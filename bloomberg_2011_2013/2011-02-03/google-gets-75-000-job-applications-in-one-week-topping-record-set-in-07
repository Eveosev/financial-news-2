  Google Inc ., the world’s biggest
Internet-search service, received more than 75,000 job
applications worldwide last week, setting a record for the
company as it embarks on a hiring spree.  The flood of resumes topped a previous high set in May 2007
by 15 percent, said Aaron Zamost, a spokesman for the  Mountain
View , California-based company. Google, which had 24,400 workers
at the end of 2010, announced last week that it would add more
than 6,000 employees this year.  The company is stepping up hiring as it pushes deeper into
mobile services, display advertising and Internet applications.
Google also faces steeper competition from Silicon Valley rivals
Facebook Inc. and  Apple Inc . for users and engineering talent.
The company aims to hire more workers in 2011 than any year in
its history, exceeding its 2007 record.  “We’re looking for top talent,”  Alan Eustace , senior vice
president of engineering and research, said last week in a
 blog posting . “We’ll hire as many smart, creative people as we
can to tackle some of the toughest challenges in computer
science: like building a Web-based operating system from
scratch, instantly searching an index of more than 100 million
gigabytes and even developing cars that drive themselves.”  While Google remains one of the most desirable places to
work in Silicon Valley, it lost some luster in the past three
years. It was ranked as America's best workplace by Fortune 
magazine in 2007 and 2008. Since then, it has ranked fourth.  Facebook, Apple  Facebook and Apple, meanwhile, have emerged as a bigger
threat to Google’s prime source of revenue: ad dollars.
Facebook’s 500 million-plus users have provided an alluring
target for advertisers, which will spend $4.05 billion on the
site this year, according to EMarketer Inc. The closely held
company, based in  Palo Alto ,  California , surpassed Google in
U.S. Internet visitors in 2010, according to Experian Hitwise.  Apple, located in Cupertino, California, is challenging
Google on the mobile front. It introduced an advertising service
called iAd that works with its iPhone and iPad. Google leads the
market for mobile-based ads in the U.S.  Google dropped $1.85 to $610.15 at 4 p.m. New York time on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares declined 4.2 percent last
year, compared with a 53 percent gain for Apple.  To contact the reporter on this story:
