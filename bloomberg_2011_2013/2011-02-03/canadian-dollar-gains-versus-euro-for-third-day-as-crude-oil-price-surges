The Canadian dollar reached the
strongest in almost two weeks against the euro after the
region’s central bank left  interest rates  unchanged, damping
demand for the common currency.  European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said
inflation risks are “broadly balanced,” dimming the prospects
of an increase in interest rates. The loonie, as the currency is
nicknamed, weakened against the  U.S. dollar  as commodities fell,
curtailing the allure of higher-yielding currencies.  “The price action has been exacerbated by the words coming
from Trichet,” said  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign
exchange at National Bank of Canada in Toronto. “The price
action in dollar-Canada has been muted and much of that can be
attributed to the desire of the market participants to be
sitting on the sideline ahead of the payrolls number in  Canada 
tomorrow.”  The Canadian dollar gained 1 percent to C$1.3514 per euro
at 5 p.m. in Toronto, after strengthening to C$1.3479, the
strongest since Jan. 21. The currency fell 0.3 percent to 99.11
cents per U.S. dollar, from 98.79 cents yesterday. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.009.  The loonie is headed for its first weekly gain in three
against its U.S. counterpart. It’s added 1 percent so far this
week.  ECB Rates  The ECB kept interest rates at 1 percent and did not change
the region’s anti-inflation stance even after the gauge
accelerated last month the fastest since October 2008. The
decision was expected by all 58 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The ECB benchmark interest rate is equal to that of
Canada’s.  Both the U.S. and Canada will report January unemployment
Feb. 4. Canada added 15,000 jobs in the month after a 30,400
gain in December, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 26 economists.  Copper for three-month delivery climbed as high as $10,000
a ton and was up $2 at $9,947 in  London . Canada derives about
half its export revenue from the sale of commodities.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
fell 0.8 and crude oil dropped as much as 1 percent after
advancing as much as 1.3 percent.  “The Canadian dollar is still somewhat of a risk
barometer,” said  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at
Toronto-Dominion Bank.   Risk aversion  is helping the U.S.
dollar. We’re not seeing that much positive impact on the
Canadian dollar.”    Government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on Canada’s
benchmark 10-year note up four basis points to 3.42 percent, the
highest level since June. The price of 3.5 percent security due
in June 2020 dropped 33 cents to C$100.65.  The  Bank of Canada  plans to sell C$3.2 billion of 3-year
notes Feb. 9. The 2 percent securities mature in March 2014,
according to the bank’s website.  To contact the reporter for this story:
