The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will raise crude shipments 1.7 percent
through next month amid strong demand from  Asia , according to
Oil Movements.  Loadings will rise to 24.16 million barrels a day in the
four weeks to Feb. 19, from 23.75 million barrels a day in the
period to Jan. 22, the tanker-tracker said today in a report.  “Eastern demand is driving the ship,” said Roy Mason, Oil
Movements’ founder, today by phone from Halifax,  England . The
increase in cargoes is “virtually all going east,” he said.  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will increase by 1.1 percent to 17.89
million barrels a day, Oil Movements’ data show.  “It’s clear from the tanker market that the Iraqis are
doing much more business,” Mason said.  A total of 491.41 million barrels of crude will be on board
tankers in the month to Feb. 19, up 3 percent from the Jan. 22
figure of 477.02 million, according to Oil Movements, which
calculates shipments by keeping a tally of tanker-rental
agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships used
as floating storage.  North Sea Brent climbed to a 28-month high of more than
$103 a barrel today after clashes broke out between anti-
government protesters and supporters of President Hosni Mubarak
in Cairo. Brent had risen more than 5 percent in the previous
four days.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  Iraq  is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
