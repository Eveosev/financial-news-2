  Tam SA  rallied the most in three
weeks after Brazil’s antitrust regulator said it doesn’t need to
request more information on the takeover of the nation’s biggest
airline by market share by Chile’s  LAN Airlines SA .  Cade, as the regulator is known, won’t negotiate an
agreement to reverse the deal before ruling, Olavo Chinaglia, a
council member at the regulator, said in an interview today.  Tam climbed 1.6 percent to 35.65 reais in Sao Paulo trading
at 8:56 a.m. New York time, the steepest advance on a closing
basis since Jan. 12.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
