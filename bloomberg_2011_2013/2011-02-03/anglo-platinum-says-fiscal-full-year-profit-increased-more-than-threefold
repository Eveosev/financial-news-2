  Anglo Platinum Ltd ., the largest
producer of the metal, climbed to the highest in eight days in
Johannesburg after reporting higher-than-forecast earnings.  Anglo Platinum advanced as much as 2.3 percent to 736.94
rand, the highest level since Jan. 24. It was trading at 728.64
rand by 11:30 a.m. in the city, valuing the  Anglo American Plc 
unit at 192 billion rand ($27 billion).  Earnings rose to between 37.88 rand and 40.35 rand a share
from 12.34 rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company
said in a statement today, citing “the revaluation of an
interest in a joint venture.” Anglo Platinum, which sold a 37
percent interest in the Western Bushveld Joint Venture last
year, forecast earnings of between 35.79 rand and 38.25 rand on
Jan. 13. Detailed earnings will be released on Feb. 7.  The producer maintained its forecast for earnings excluding
one-time items, a benchmark for local analysts, at 19.07 rand to
19.65 rand. The figure compares with the median estimate of
19.57 rand a share by 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Earnings increased mainly on higher metals prices, Anglo
Platinum said last month. Platinum prices rose 33 percent to an
average $1,613.46 an ounce in  London  last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
