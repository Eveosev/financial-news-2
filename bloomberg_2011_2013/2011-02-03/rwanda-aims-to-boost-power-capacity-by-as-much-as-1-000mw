Rwanda aims to increase generating
capacity by as much as 1,000 megawatts by 2017, said Yussuf
Uwamahoro, an official at the Energy Ministry.  The West African country is seeking investors to generate
power from methane gas, hydropower dams and peat, Uwamahoro, an
energy commissioner, said yesterday at a conference in the
Ugandan capital, Kampala.  “Rwanda urgently needs power,” he said. “There are
opportunities for investors.”  The country plans to expand its electricity grid to cover
half of its 10 million population by 2017, compared with 110,000
now, according to the ministry. It currently has a generating
capacity of 60 megawatts.  At least 300 megawatts may be generated from methane gas
found in Lake Kivu, which the country shares with neighboring
Democratic Republic of Congo. Another 310 megawatts could come
from geothermal power, 295 megawatts from hydropower and 100
megawatts from peat, Uwamahoro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
