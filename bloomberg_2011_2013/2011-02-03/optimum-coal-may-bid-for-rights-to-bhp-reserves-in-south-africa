  Optimum Coal Holdings  Ltd., a South
African producer of the fuel, may bid for undeveloped coal
reserves held by larger competitor  BHP Billiton Ltd . as rising
prices boost demand.  “Let’s review all these assets they put on the table and
see which ones we consider,” Mike Teke, chief executive officer
of the Johannesburg-based company, said in a telephone interview
from the city today.  Optimum , majority-owned by black investors, is looking for
ways to boost production to meet higher demand for coal. The
price of the fuel shipped through  South Africa ’s Richards Bay
terminal rose about 60 percent last year to $129.75 a metric
ton, according to IHS McCloskey data on Bloomberg.  BHP said Jan. 31 it invited bidders for some undeveloped
coal prospects, saying black investor groups could expand their
participation in the industry. The government is pushing mining
companies to sell equity and projects to black people, who were
disenfranchised by the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.  Optimum rose as much as 3.6 percent to 34.20 rand in
Johannesburg trading after announcing a fourfold increase in
fiscal first-half profit. The stock was at 33.60 rand as of
10:15 a.m. local time.  Net income advanced to 274.6 million rand ($38 million) in
the six months through December from 69.7 million rand a year
earlier as output and prices rose, the company said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
