  Investec Plc , a South African private
bank and wealth manager, expects full-year profit to be
“constrained” by the slow recovery in non-performing loans and
the number of banking transactions.  “The asset- and wealth-management businesses have
benefitted from substantial inflows and a good investment
performance,” the London- and Johannesburg-listed lender said
in a statement today. Still, the company expects profit in the
year ending March 31 to be “constrained” as “the demand for
credit and levels of transactional activity remain subdued.”  Investec, which also has operations in  Australia , is moving
away from lending to conserve capital while investing in its
asset-management business to boost earnings. The company is
planning to expand its offices in  India  and  Hong Kong  to capture
more business in that region, while its specialist-banking
division plans to follow the asset-management unit into Africa
to boost transaction flows.  The company’s net income in the nine months through
December increased 4 percent. It didn’t provide the profit
figure. Investec said the capital-adequacy ratio of its London
business stood at 15.9 percent and that assets under management
rose 19 percent to 88 billion pounds ($142.5 billion).  Investec rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to 56.70 rand as of
9:15 a.m. in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
