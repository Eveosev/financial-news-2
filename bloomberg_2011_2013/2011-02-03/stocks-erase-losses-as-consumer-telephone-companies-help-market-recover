U.S. stocks erased losses as gains in
consumer and telephone stocks helped the market recover from an
early slump.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2 percent to
1,306.00 at 2:59 p.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.7
percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 12.38
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,054.35.  Earlier declines came as a stronger dollar weighed on
commodity producers and Merck & Co. led losses in drugmakers
after its profit forecast trailed estimates.  The Dow average closed above 12,000 for the first time
since June 2008 this week after U.S. and Chinese manufacturing
expanded and United Parcel Service Inc. beat analysts’ earnings
estimates. About 74 percent of the 266 companies in the S&P 500
that have reported results since Jan. 10 topped earnings-per-
share projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
