SAP AG (SAP) , the business software maker
ordered in November to pay $1.3 billion to rival Oracle Corp.,
must get a bond for that amount while it seeks to reduce or
appeal the damage award, a judge ordered.  Oracle accused SAP’s U.S.-based TomorrowNow software-
maintenance unit of making hundreds of thousands of illegal
downloads and several thousand copies of Oracle’s software to
avoid paying licensing fees and to steal customers. A jury
awarded the damages after an 11-day trial in Oakland,
California. It was the largest U.S. jury award of 2010.  U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland today
granted SAP’s request to delay payment to Redwood City,
California-based Oracle. She gave Walldorf, Germany-based SAP 21
days to post a bond for the full amount.  SAP has said it will ask Hamilton to reduce the award or
grant a new trial and, if necessary, will appeal the verdict,
which it called excessive.  Oracle, the second-biggest maker of business software, sued
SAP in 2007.  Deborah Hellinger , an Oracle spokeswoman, declined to
comment. Jim Dever, an SAP spokesman, had no immediate comment.  The case is  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  v SAP AG, 07-01658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
