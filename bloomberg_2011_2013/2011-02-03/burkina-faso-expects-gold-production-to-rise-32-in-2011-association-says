  Burkina Faso  expects gold production
to rise 32 percent to 33.74 metric tons this year as mines
expand, Elie Justin Ouedregao, president of the country’s
Professional Mining Association said.  Production will rise from 25.6 tons last year and 11.73
tons in 2009, he said in an interview in Ougadougou, the country’s
capital. The association represents mining companies operating
in the country.  Societe Des Mines De Taparko, a unit of Toronto-based  High
River Gold Mines Ltd ., will produce 4.25 tons of the metal this
year compared with 3.92 tons last year, he said. The Essakane
mine, owned by Toronto’s Iamgold Corp., will more than double
output to 13.11 tons from 5.7 tons while the Youga mine,
controlled by Cayman Islands-based  Endeavour Mining Corp ., will
boost production to 2.65 tons from 2.47 tons, he said.  Production at the Belahouro mine, owned by London’s Avocet
Mining Plc, will be little changed at 5.29 tons while production
at Kalsaka, a mine owned by London-based  Cluff Gold Plc , will
fall to 2.28 tons from 2.63 tons, he said. There are other gold
mines in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
