Airbus SAS is churning out its A330
wide-body aircraft in record numbers and has rival  Boeing Co . to
thank for the 17-year-old jet’s second wind.  Production of the twin-aisle jet will rise to 10 a month by
mid-2013, from eight now, to satisfy “unprecedented” demand, the
Toulouse, France-based manufacturer said yesterday. The jet,
which sells for about $200 million at list price, is a favorite
in the fleets of carriers including Delta Air Lines Inc. and
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.  “There’s frustrated demand out there for the plane,”
Airbus Sales Chief John Leahy said in an interview. “I wish I
could get my hands on another 15 or 20 even for 2012.”  Airbus is revving up production as Boeing grapples with
more than three years of delays on its 787 Dreamliner, announced
in 2003 as an alternative to the A330 after Airbus quashed
demand for the Boeing 767 model that’s almost twice the age of
the A330. Boeing’s Dreamliner woes have left dozens of airlines
with holes in their fleets, driving some to other aircraft.  The A330 twin-engine aircraft that seats 250 to 330
passengers and entered service in 1994 flies as far as 6,450
nautical miles, servicing routes across the U.S. or the North
Atlantic, as well as many intra-Asian connections. The larger
A330-300 can cover about 5,500 nautical miles.  Longest Fuselage  Cathay operates the largest fleet of A330, with 31 aircraft
in service, followed by Emirates and Delta Air. Airbus also
offers the A340, with an identical cabin width, though with four
engines as well as the longest fuselage of any aircraft to
accommodate more passengers.  With about 1,100 orders in total today, the Airbus A330’s
best year was 2007, when it won 186 orders. That was the same
year Boeing announced its first delay on the 787. Demand has
crept up in recent years, with 62 orders for the jet in 2010.  Boeing concedes that its delayed 787 has helped its rival.  “The A330 had the best year ever, because we were late and
airlines needed a gap-filler airplane,” Boeing Commercial
Airplanes President  Jim Albaugh  said Feb. 2, speaking at a
ceremony where Boeing rolled out the 1,000th 767 it has built.
The 767, which started flying in 1982, is the second wide-body
airliner in history to reach the 1,000 mark, after the Boeing
747 jumbo.  Shipments include aircraft outfitted as refueling tankers
to armed forces in Japan and  Italy . Airbus also offers the A330
in a configuration as a refuelling tanker, and the two companies
are competing to upgrade the U.S. Air Force fleet.  Dreamliner Woes  The Dreamliner is more than three years behind schedule
after Boeing struggled with parts shortages, manufacturing
defects, incomplete work by suppliers and redesigns. The
Chicago-based manufacturer, which had to concede the industry
lead to Airbus in 2003 and hasn’t regained it since, aims to put
the Dreamliner into service by the third quarter of this year,
rather than May 2008 as planned.  Shares of European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co., the
parent company of Airbus, have advanced 42 percent over the past
12 months. Boeing stock has gained 15 percent in the period.  The Dreamliner delays have forced the company to pay
penalties to airlines that were counting on the plane to offer
new routes. Boeing has won 847 orders for the jet in total, with
All Nippon Airways Co. slated to fly the first one.  “This is the biggest embarrassment for Boeing,” said  Richard Aboulafia , vice president of Fairfax, Virginia-based
aviation consultant The Teal Group. “The 787 penalty payments
are going directly to Airbus for A330s.”  Optimising Capacity  Part of the A330’s appeal stems from its range and
reliability that has made it an aircraft of choice for airlines
connecting longer-distance routes between  Europe  and the U.S.
that don’t require longer-haul aircraft such as upcoming Airbus
A350 aircraft or the Dreamliner, Airbus’s Leahy said.  “It’s a very flexible plane for airlines that can be used
in various configurations that can bring value to all sorts of
airline business models,’ said Henri Courpron, chief executive
officer of International Lease Finance Corp., which has 89 of
the planes in its portfolio. “The A330-200 has phenomenal range
that allows airlines to open new routes and go places not
reachable before with twin-engine planes of that size.”  The A330 is also popular because it is readily available.
The 787, apart from being delayed, is sold out for years, while
the A350 wide-body aircraft is still being assembled and won’t
fly before the latter part of 2013.  Boeing’s Albaugh said constrained supply of wide-body
aircraft over the next decade may help rekindle demand for the
767, for which Boeing only 49  unfilled orders  out of a total of
3,419. Lower production costs will also help demand, he said.  Such surprise boosts are not uncommon in the aviation
industry amid because of a change in market conditions, or
another manufacturers’ difficulties, said Coupron.  “The 787’s been delayed, and certainly that’s given the
A330 a second life that nobody expected,” he said in a
telephone interview. “There’s always a silver lining.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
