Central African Republic President
Francois Bozize was re-elected with 66 percent of the vote in a
Jan. 23 election,  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  reported, citing the
countryâ€™s electoral commission.  Rivals including Ange-Felix Patasse, who was deposed by
Bozize in a coup in 2003, accused the commission of favoring the
incumbent and plan to challenge the result in the constitutional
council, the news agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
