DONG Energy A/S is seeking
international investors, including pension funds, to help
finance the construction of off-shore wind energy parks in
Denmark,  Germany  and the U.K., Borsen said, citing Chief
Executive Officer Anders Eldrup.  The need for institutional investors to step in applies not
only to DONG but to the  energy industry  in general, because the
financial crisis has left government budgets in a "miserable
state," the Copenhagen-based newspaper said, citing the
executive.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
