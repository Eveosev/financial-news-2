  Credit Suisse Group AG  hired  Imran Khan , an equity analyst from JPMorgan Chase & Co., to head
Internet investment banking.  Khan will be a managing director based in  San Francisco  and
start in May, according to an internal memo, which was confirmed
by Duncan King, a spokesman for the Swiss bank. He will report
to David Wah, global head of technology, and Bryce Lee, head of
technology in the Americas, the memo said.  As an analyst, Khan covered  Google Inc ., EBay Inc., Yahoo!
Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Wall Street firms are competing to win
mandates for initial public offerings of Internet companies such
as Groupon Inc. and Facebook Inc., amid increasing mergers and
acquisitions in the industry.  Credit Suisse is beefing up its technology investment
banking team after George Boutros, its former chairman of
technology and health care groups in San Francisco, left in
April to join Frank Quattrone’s Qatalyst Partners. Boutros was
one of Credit Suisse’s top dealmakers in the city and advised on
more than 300 transactions, including Sun Microsystems Inc.’s
sale to Oracle Corp., Google’s purchase of Youtube and Pixar’s
sale to  Walt Disney Co .  Khan was the head of JPMorgan’s global Internet research
since 2004. His recruitment follows the appointment of Citigroup
Inc.’s Mark Simonian as Credit Suisse’s global co-head of
telecommunications, media and technology in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
