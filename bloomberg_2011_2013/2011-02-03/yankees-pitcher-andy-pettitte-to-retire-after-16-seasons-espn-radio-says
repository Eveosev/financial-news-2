  Andy Pettitte , who won more
postseason games than any other pitcher in history and helped
the  New York Yankees  to five World Series championships, will
retire, ESPN Radio in  New York  is reporting, without saying
where it received the information.  Pettitte, 38, would leave  Major League Baseball  with a
240-138 record and 3.88 earned-run average over 16 seasons, all
but three of them in New York. He earned 19 wins in
the postseason.  Yankees spokesman Michael Margolis declined comment on
Pettitteâ€™s future.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
