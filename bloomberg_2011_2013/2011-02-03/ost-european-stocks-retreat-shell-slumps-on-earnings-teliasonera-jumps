Most European stocks declined as
gunfire erupted in the middle of Cairo and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. Japanese
shares slid, while U.S. futures fluctuated.  Shell slumped 2.6 percent after saying earnings from its
refining division remained “under pressure” last quarter.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed,
sliding 0.1 percent to 284.41 at 9:32 a.m. in  London  after
earlier retreating as much as 0.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
