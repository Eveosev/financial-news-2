Rental returns for Australian
commercial properties remained negative in the December quarter
and expectations for value and rental growth have been cut as
financing constraints and higher  interest rates  dampen demand, a  National Australia Bank Ltd . survey showed.  NAB’s commercial property index, which measures capital
value and rental pricing expectations among people in the real
estate industry, fell 1.4 points in December after gaining 4.9
points in September, NAB said. Industrial properties and hotels
fared worst, while retail real estate improved slightly,
according to the survey.  “Business conditions in the commercial  property market  are
likely to be considerably weaker than anticipated in our
previous survey,” NAB said in the report. “The index is not
expected to approach the peak of the last survey until September
2012, signaling a much slower pace of recovery.”  Demand for commercial properties has been hit by the
central bank’s seven interest-rate increases since October 2009,
which has weighed on consumer and business confidence.
Australian  consumer confidence  fell in January to a seven-month
low and business confidence plunged in December to the lowest
level in 19 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
