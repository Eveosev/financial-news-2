  Banco Santander SA , Spain’s biggest
bank, said fourth-quarter profit declined 4.6 percent as
impairments increased and a drop in earnings from its home
market offset growth in Brazil and the U.K.  Net income fell to 2.1 billion euros ($2.9 billion) from
2.2 billion euros a year earlier, the Santander-based bank  said 
in a filing to regulators today. Chairman  Emilio Botin  pledged
to boost capital levels, seek stock listings in the U.K. and  Argentina  and pay a dividend of 60 cents a share this year,
matching that of 2010.  Santander has been hurt by impairments on real estate in
its home market and higher funding costs as some analysts
question whether it has enough capital. Botin, 76, who has led
acquisitions valued at more than $70 billion as chairman since
1986, forecast an “excellent year” in 2011 and said his bank
didn’t need to buy more lenders to grow because its geographical
rollout is now complete.  “They are much, much less exposed than other banks to a
really difficult market, which is  Spain , and that was really
clever of them,” said Peter Braendle, who helps manage about
$62 billion at Swisscanto Asset Management in Zurich, including
Santander shares.  ‘Tough Years’  Earnings beat the 2.04 billion-euro average estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company in October had
dropped its goal of posting 2010 profit at about the same level
as the previous year’s 8.94 billion euros as it accounts for bad
loans more quickly to meet new Spanish banking regulations.  “2011 and 2012 will still be tough years, but I believe
the worst is behind us,” Botin said at a  Madrid  press
conference today.  Santander said its core capital ratio, a measure of
financial strength, was at 8.8 percent at the end of the year,
compared with 8.5 percent in September, and expects it to exceed
9 percent by the end of 2011.  Spanish banks are under pressure to show they’ve shored up
their capital bases after the government last month set a
September deadline for them to meet a minimum core capital level
of 8 percent. Santander will attempt to list its U.K. business,
run by Botin’s daughter Ana Patricia, 50, in the last quarter of
this year and is also seeking approvals to sell shares in its
Argentine business, he said.  “We comply and will comply comfortably with present and
future regulatory requirements,” Botin said.  Bad Loans  Santander shares dropped 1.7 percent to close at 8.99 euros
in Madrid, paring gains this year to 13 percent. That compares
with an 11 percent gain in the 48-member Bloomberg Europe Banks
and Financial Services Index.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria
SA , which published earnings yesterday, has climbed 19 percent
in the same period.  Bad loans as a proportion of total lending at the group
rose to 3.55 percent from 3.24 percent a year ago and 3.42
percent at the end of September.  Costs for covering insolvencies climbed to 2.4 billion
euros from 2.28 billion euros a year earlier, bringing the
bank’s total provisioning last year to more than 10 billion
euros. Net loans newly entered into default rose to 3.8 billion
euros from 2.9 billion euros in the third quarter.  Spanish Property  The bank said it had 27.3 billion euros of loans linked to
Spanish property development, 12 percent of total lending in the
country. Of those loans, 17 percent is in arrears and another
4.9 billion euros are deemed “substandard” or have a risk of
defaulting. Santander has acquired financed property worth 7.5
billion euros, for which it has provisions set aside to cover 31
percent of that amount.  Net interest income climbed 7.5 percent from a year earlier
to 7.33 billion euros.  Earnings from the bank’s Spanish retail network fell to 248
million euros from 470 million euros a year ago, the company
said. The bank boosted Spanish deposits by 21 percent as lending
at its retail network dropped 3 percent. Lending from  Portugal 
declined 7 percent.  Profit from the U.K. rose to 452 million euros from 412
million euros a year earlier, while earnings from  Brazil  climbed
to 756 million euros from 578 million euros. Profit at
Santander’s Sovereign unit in the U.S. climbed to 132 million
euros in the fourth quarter from 3 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter for this story:
