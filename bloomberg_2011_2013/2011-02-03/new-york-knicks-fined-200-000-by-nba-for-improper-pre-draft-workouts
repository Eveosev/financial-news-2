The  New York Knicks  were fined
$200,000 by the  National Basketball Association  for holding
workouts of college players in violation of league rules, the
NBA said today in a statement.  Rodney Heard, the Knicks scout who conducted the workouts
in May of 2007 and 2010, was fined $20,000 by the NBA.  NBA rules at the time prohibited teams from holding or
attending workouts with draft-eligible college players before
the league’s annual pre-draft evaluation camp.  “We will abide by the NBA’s decision and have no further
comment,” Knicks spokesman Jonathan Supranowitz said in an e-
mailed statement.  Heard, who was hired as the Knicks’ East Coast scouting
director by former coach Isiah Thomas in 2006, coordinated
improper workouts in Atlanta that may have given the team an
advantage in determining whether to draft particular players.  In 2007, Heard held multiple workouts with  Wilson Chandler 
before that year’s pre-draft camp,  Yahoo Sports reported  in
October. The Knicks later drafted Chandler with the 23rd pick.
Brandon Rush, who’s now with the Portland Trail Blazers,
told Yahoo Sports that he tore a knee ligament during a
2007 workout with Heard that forced him to withdraw from the
draft and undergo six months of rehabilitation.  In May 2002, the NBA fined the  Cleveland Cavaliers  $150,000
for including  LeBron James , then a high school junior, in a
workout when he wasn’t draft eligible. John Lucas, the
Cavaliers’ coach at the time, was suspended for two games.  In June 2005, the  Denver Nuggets  were fined $200,000 and
coach George Karl was suspended for three games for attending
workouts that included a player who was ineligible for the
draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
