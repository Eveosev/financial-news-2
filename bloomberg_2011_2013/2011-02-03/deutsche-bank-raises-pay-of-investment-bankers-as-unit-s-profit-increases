  Deutsche Bank AG  boosted average
compensation per employee at its corporate and investment bank
by 4.5 percent in 2010 after income at the division surged,
contrasting with pay cuts at U.S. competitors.    Germany ’s biggest bank reserved enough to pay an average of
372,765 euros ($514,378) to each of the 15,943 workers at the
division, which includes transaction banking,  company filings 
show. That compared with 356,634 euros in 2009. Pretax profit at
the corporate and investment bank jumped 39 percent to 6 billion
euros for the year, the Frankfurt-based bank said today.  Financial firms worldwide are facing public and political
pressure to limit bankers’ compensation after taxpayers were
forced to bail out the industry during the financial crisis.
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s investment bank set aside enough to pay
an average of $369,651 to each employee for 2010, 2.4 percent
less than in 2009.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . cut average
compensation to $430,700 in 2010, a reduction of 14 percent.  Anshu Jain, head of Deutsche Bank’s corporate and
investment bank, said today when asked about 2010 pay compared
to U.S. peers that value to employees, which includes the cash,
stock, immediate and deferred components of bankers’ bonuses,
had shrunk.  “We did not go up, quite to the contrary, we’ve gone
down,” he said at a press conference in Frankfurt today.  Bonuses Decline  Bonuses in total declined in 2010, Deutsche Bank Chief
Operating Officer Hermann-Josef Lamberti also told reporters in
Frankfurt today, without quantifying the drop. Compensation for
the year reflects the bank’s decision to pay more in salary and
less in bonuses, he said.  Overall compensation at the corporate and investment bank
rose 17 percent to 5.94 billion euros from 5.06 billion euros in
2009, company data showed. That corresponds to about 28 percent
of the division’s total net revenue for the year. Compensation
included 286 million euros in severance pay last year, up from
145 million euros a year earlier, according to the bank.  Average compensation per worker doesn’t reflect the amount
of money employees actually receive. Top executives and revenue
producers sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards, while
clerical employees receive much smaller salaries.  Deutsche Bank’s compensation total for the corporate and
investment bank excludes pay for back-office workers such as
information-technology employees. The published amount for
compensation and benefits may also include parts of compensation
from previous years that have been paid out in 2010 and may
exclude some payments deferred for future years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
