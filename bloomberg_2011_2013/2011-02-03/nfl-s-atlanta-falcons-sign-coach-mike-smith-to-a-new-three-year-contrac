The  Atlanta Falcons  signed coach  Mike Smith  to a new three-year contract after he guided the National
Football League team to its first division title in six years.  In his third season with the team, Smith led the Falcons to
a 13-3 record and a division title before losing to the  Green
Bay Packers  48-21 in the second round of the playoffs.  Financial terms of the contract weren’t disclosed in a
 statement  by the team.  “When we hired Mike Smith, we believed we had found the
total package: a head coach with strong leadership skills and
experience and the track record to back it up, and a man of high
character and integrity,” Falcons Owner Arthur Blank said. “In
his three seasons with us, Coach Smith has demonstrated all of
these characteristics, and then some.”  Under Smith, the Falcons have compiled a 33-15 record, the
best three-year coaching mark in team history.  The Falcons were the only team in the NFL this season to
rank in the top five in both scoring offense (25.9 points per
game) and scoring defense (18.0 points per game), earning Smith
NFL Coach of the Year honors by the Sporting News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
