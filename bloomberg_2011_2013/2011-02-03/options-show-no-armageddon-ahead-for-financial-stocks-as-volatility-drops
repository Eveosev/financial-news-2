Options to protect U.S. banks and
brokers are the cheapest since the crisis began in 2007,
indicating that investors are betting financial companies will
continue leading the stock-market recovery.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money options expiring in three months on the  Financial
Select Sector SPDR Fund  has tumbled to 19.96 this week. That’s
the lowest since July 2007 relative to equivalent options on the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, showing that investors are less uncertain about financial
companies relative to other stocks than at any time since the
worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.  “It has to do with people’s growing confidence that
financial Armageddon is off the table,” said Barry Bausano, the
New York-based head of Global Markets Equities Americas at
Deutsche Bank AG in  New York . “The market is reflecting
expectations that there will be a narrower and more stable range
of outcomes for U.S. financial institutions.”  Financial companies have rebounded 167 percent and posted
the best performance among 10 industry groups since the S&P 500
fell to a 12-year low in March 2009. The S&P advanced 93 percent
in the same time period, and had its biggest rally in 65 years
from March 2009 to December 2010. Banks have led gains as the  Federal Reserve  injected more than $2 trillion into the economy
to boost growth and markets continue to recover from the 2008
credit crisis.  Volatility  The 21-day historic volatility on the fund, which tracks 81
U.S. lenders and brokers such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Bank
of America Corp ., was 17.65, down from its one-year high of
45.31 in June. Its shares gained less than 0.1 percent to $16.62
today, while the S&P fund rose 0.2 percent to $130.78.  “The sector does not at this time appear likely to be a
source of big surprises in one direction or the other,” said
Brian Barish, who oversees $6 billion as president of Cambiar
Investors LLC in Denver. “The returns profile of many
financials will increasingly be of a somewhat regulated and
boring nature, which I suppose would be consistent with much
lower volatility.”  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, fell 3.5 percent to 16.69
today, and it dropped to 15.37 in intraday trading on Jan. 14.
The VIX hasn’t closed below that level since July 2007.  Earnings  Thirty-five of the 55 financial companies in the S&P 500
that have reported earnings since Jan. 10 have posted results
beating estimates, Bloomberg data show. Bank of America and
JPMorgan, the two largest U.S. banks by assets, both reported
earnings last month that beat analyst estimates.    Goldman Sachs Group Inc . reported its third straight
quarterly earnings decline on Jan. 19. The New York-based
company’s profit was $3.79 a share excluding some items and
missed estimates.  “We’re on a slow path to recovery,” said Jesse Lubarsky,
a New York-based trader at Raymond James & Associates. “Banks
need to rally for the market to go a lot higher.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
