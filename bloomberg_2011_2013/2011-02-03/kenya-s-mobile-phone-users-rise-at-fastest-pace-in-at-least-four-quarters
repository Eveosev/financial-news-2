  Kenya ’s mobile-phone users rose at
the fastest pace in at least four quarters in the three months
through September as tariffs in the East African nation fell,
the  Communications Commission of Kenya  said.  The number of users increased 9.5 percent to 22 million in
the third quarter of 2010, the Nairobi-based commission said on
its website today. In the three months through June, user
numbers increased 1 percent, and rose 2.6 percent and 8.4
percent in the two preceding quarters, according to data
compiled by the commission.  Kenya’s telecommunications regulator in August ordered
mobile-phone operators to halve the rates they charge each other
to transmit calls across networks. That triggered a round of
reductions in call costs by companies to as low as 2 shillings
(less than 1 cent) per minute.  “Mobile tariffs reduced significantly over the quarter
registering an average of 2.65 shillings ($0.03) for on-network
calls per minute from 4.78 shillings per minute in the previous
period,” the commission said.  During the quarter, Airtel Kenya Ltd., the domestic unit of
Delhi-based  Bharti Airtel Ltd ., grew its market share to 13.5
percent, or 1.14 million users, from 9.1 percent in the previous
three months. Telkom Kenya Ltd., a unit of  France Telecom SA ,
expanded its market share to 4 percent, or 323,298 users, from
2.7 percent, the commission said.  Market Share    Safaricom Ltd ., the biggest operator, had its market share
drop to 75.9 percent from 80.7 percent even as it added 473,979
users. Essar Telecom Kenya Ltd., a subsidiary of Essar Group,
lost 26,266 customers as its market share slipped to 6.7 percent
from 7.4 percent, the commission said.  The number of fixed lines declined 2.6 percent to 228,391,
it said.  Kenya is estimated to have 8.69 million  Internet users 
compared with 7.8 million in the previous quarter. Broadband
subscriptions increased to 84,726, representing 0.97 percent of
the total internet subscriptions in the country, from 18,626 in
the previous quarter, the regulator said. Mobile Internet
subscriptions accounted for 99 percent of users in the period.  “Mobile shall continue to dominate the provision of  Internet service  as competition in the voice market intensifies,
compelling operators to diversify into other products and
services in order to sustain and grow revenue,” the regulator
said.  Safricom, 40 percent-owned by Vodafone Plc, the world’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, had a 92.18 percent share of
mobile Internet user market, or 2.98 million subscribers,
followed by Airtel at 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
