  Radian Group Inc ., the second-largest
U.S. mortgage insurer, fell in New York trading as the firm said
“uncertainty” over an eventual return to profit forced a
writedown of tax assets, fueling a fourth-quarter loss.  Radian declined 24 cents, or 3.3 percent to $7.11 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The loss widened
to $1.1 billion, or $8.55 a share, from $91.9 million, or $1.12,
a year earlier, the Philadelphia-based company said today in a
statement. Results included a writedown of $841.5 million on tax
assets, based on the possibility of further losses.  “While Radian continues to expect a return to
profitability in the long term, this remains uncertain based on
macroeconomic factors such as the slower-than-expected pace of
the economic recovery,” the company said. All or some of the
loss on the tax assets may reverse if the company returns to
sustained profitability, Radian said. The assets reflect prior
losses that can be used to offset future taxes.  Radian’s full-year loss widened to $1.8 billion, or $15.74
a share, from $147.9 million, or $1.80, in 2009. Mortgage
insurers, which pay lenders after sales of foreclosed homes fail
to recover costs, have suffered losses during the past three
years as unemployment rates near the highest in a quarter
century depressed the housing market.  The insurer has dropped 12 percent this year after almost
doubling in 2009 and jumping 10 percent last year. Radian traded
for more than $67 a share in 2007, before the mortgage crisis.  Radian Asset Assurance, the company’s bond-insurance unit,
agreed on Feb. 1 to purchase Municipal and Infrastructure
Assurance Corp., a New York-based financial-guaranty insurance
company that has obtained licenses in 36 states. The purchase
price of $82 million is $7 million more than the value of the
capital base of MIAC, which consists of $75 million of cash and
Treasuries, Radian said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
