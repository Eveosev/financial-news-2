  Paul Collingwood  will miss England’s
final one-day cricket match against Australia with a back injury
but should be ready for the World Cup later this month.  Collingwood, 34, was injured in yesterday’s two-wicket loss
in Sydney and will return to the U.K. to begin his recovery, the
England and Wales Cricket Board said on its website.  He’ll sit out the game in Perth in two days and should be
ready to join the squad when it departs Feb. 12 for the World
Cup in India, Bangladesh and  Sri Lanka , the England board said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
