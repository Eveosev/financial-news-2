The benchmark price of tea in Malawi,  Africa ’s largest producer of the crop after Kenya, fell 21
percent at auction as rain boosted supplies of the leaf.  The top grade of tea, known as pekoe fannings, fetched
$1.95 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) at a sale in the commercial
capital, Blantyre, on Feb. 1, compared with $2.47 a week
earlier, Tea Brokers, which manages the country’s tea auctions,
said in an e-mailed report today. Supplies at the sale jumped 26
percent to 289,880 kilograms, it said.  Heavy rain means “we’re receiving too much leaf from
farmers, so much that we’re throwing some away,” Clement
Thindwa, chief executive officer of the Tea Association of
Malawi, said by phone from the city. “The leaves have to be
picked every other day as they grow, because once we stop
picking quality is compromised.”  Political unrest in Egypt is also affecting tea prices in  Malawi , Thindwa said. “I can’t tell now how much of an impact
this unrest will have, but we will definitely be affected
because  Egypt  buys quite some quantity,” he said, without
giving further details.  Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign exchange earner,
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from Malawi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
