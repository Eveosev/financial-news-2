  Softbank Corp ., the exclusive
provider of  Apple Inc .’s iPhone in Japan, raised its annual
profit forecast 20 percent, citing demand for the touch-screen
smartphone.  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, will probably climb to a record 600
billion yen ($7.3 billion) in the year ending in March, the
Tokyo-based carrier said in a statement today. That exceeded the
565.5 billion yen average profit forecast of 22 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  President Masayoshi Son is expanding the company’s
smartphone lineup with models running  Google Inc .’s Android
software to fend off competition from larger rivals  NTT DoCoMo
Inc . and  KDDI Corp . Shipments of handsets that can surf the
Internet, play music and run applications will almost triple to
6.8 million units this fiscal year, according to researcher  MM
Research Institute Ltd.   “The new outlook is a surprise,” said Hitoshi Hayakawa, a
Tokyo-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. “The growth of
new subscribers and average revenue per user in the mobile phone
business are contributing to better-than-expected earnings.”  Softbank, which reported 465.8 billion yen in operating
income last year, didn’t give net income and revenue forecasts.  Mobile Phone Unit Gains  Profit in the mobile phone unit rose 46 percent to 314.5
billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31 as revenue grew 15
percent to 1.46 trillion yen, the company said. Softbank
bolstered average revenue per user to 4,310 yen in the period
from 4,200 a year earlier, helped by increased data traffic from
iPhone users, it said.  Softbank added 925,700 net new mobile phone users in the
three months ended Dec. 31, beating DoCoMo’s 315,400 new
subscribers, according to separate filings by the carriers. KDDI
added 236,100 new customers in the period.  Net income in the quarter more than doubled to 65.5 billion
yen, from 24.1 billion yen a year earlier, Softbank said.
Operating profit increased 23 percent to 166.6 billion yen in
the quarter as revenue climbed 13 percent to 784.9 billion yen,
it said.  Softbank fell 0.9 percent to close at 2,874 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange before the earnings announcement. The stock
has added 2.2 percent this year while The benchmark  Nikkei 225 
Stock Average gained 2 percent.  Android Vs. IPhone  DoCoMo almost doubled its annual sales target for
smartphones and tablet computers to 2.5 million units last
month, from an October forecast of 1.3 million, citing demand
for Android models. The Tokyo-based carrier began selling
Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy Android smartphone in October
and released a tablet computer the following month.  Softbank offers six Android models, and KDDI announced
plans in October to expand its lineup of the handsets to five.  Smartphones will overtake regular mobile phones in Japan in
the year ending March 2013, reaching 19.3 million units, Tokyo-
based MM Research said in December. Shipments of the devices
will climb to 24.1 million in fiscal 2015, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
