Madagascar’s main opposition parties
said they are willing to join an interim government until
elections to be held by November, while rejecting proposals by
African mediators to recognize and strengthen the powers of
current President Andry Rajoelina.  The party of former President  Marc Ravalomanana  is “ready
and willing to take part in a new interim government that is
consensual and inclusive,” Roland Ravatomanga, chief of
delegation for the movement, said by phone from the capital
Antananarivo today.  The unity government was part of proposals put forward by
the  Southern African Development Community  on Jan. 31. They also
said Rajoelina should head the government and that Ravalomanana
shouldn’t return to the country from exile in  South Africa  until
stability was ensured. Rajoelina seized power from Ravalomanana
in a March 2009 in a military-backed coup.  “We don’t understand why a president like Ravalomanana,
who was elected and then ousted prematurely, can’t stand in
elections while a de facto one can and is allowed to lead the
country in the meantime,” Ravatomanga said.  The opposition Zafy movement also said it was willing to
participate in the government, while expressing reservations
about SADC’s proposals.  “We are open to discussions, but we want an interim
administration that really is consensual,” said Regis Manoro,
spokesman for the movement. “But if it continues like this and
there really is no consensus then I think the problem will take
to the streets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
