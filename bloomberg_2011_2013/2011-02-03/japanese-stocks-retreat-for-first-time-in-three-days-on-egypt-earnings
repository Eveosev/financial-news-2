Japanese stocks fell for the first
time in three days as opposing groups clashed in  Egypt  and some
company earnings missed expectations.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, fell 1.2
percent. Chiyoda Corp., a plant engineering company that gets
almost half of its income from the Middle East, lost 0.5 percent.
Panasonic Corp., the world’s largest maker of plasma televisions,
sank 3.2 percent after the company reported profit that missed
analysts’ estimates. Ricoh Co., a maker of  office equipment ,
plunged 9.9 percent after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its
investment rating.  “If the demonstrations in Egypt spill over to oil-
producing countries, the price of crude will rise further and
inflation will accelerate, boosting concerns about the economic
future of emerging countries,” said Hisakazu Amano, who helps
oversee about $29 billion at Tokyo-based T&D Asset Management Co.  The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average fell 0.3 percent to 10,431.36
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix lost 0.2 percent to
927.57, with about eight shares dropping for every seven that
gained.  The Topix has climbed 3.2 percent this year. Stocks in the
index were valued at 15.9 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 13.6 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
11.3 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Tensions in Egypt  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent yesterday
in New York as earnings reports disappointed investors and as
protests in Egypt became more violent.  Supporters of Egypt’s  Hosni Mubarak  clashed in central
Cairo with demonstrators demanding an immediate end to the 30-
year reign of the president, who said this week he won’t step
down before elections due in September.  Chiyoda slumped 0.5 percent to 733 yen. JGC Corp., a plant
engineering company that gets 34 percent of its revenue from the
Middle East, rose 0.4 percent after falling as much as 1 percent
earlier today.  “The concern is whether unrest in the Middle East will be
more than what the market expects,” said Mitsushige Akino, who
oversees about $450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co.  Crude oil for March delivery increased 0.1 percent
yesterday in  New York , after earlier climbing as much as 1.1
percent, amid concern that unrest in Egypt will threaten exports
from the Middle East. Oil extended its gain today.  Carmakers Drop  Automakers had the largest drop in the Topix among its 33
industry groups. Toyota lost 1.2 percent to 3,440 yen and its
smaller rival Honda Motor Co. fell 1.5 percent to 3,520 yen.
Mazda Motor Corp., Japan’s second-largest car exporter,
retreated 2.5 percent to 238 yen.  Fanuc Corp., a maker of industrial robots that earns about
80 percent of revenue overseas, sank 3.5 percent to 12,390 yen,
contributing the most to the Nikkei’s decline, followed by
Konami Corp. and Ricoh. Panasonic lost 3.2 percent to 1,090 yen
after reporting profit that missed analysts’ estimates as
falling prices extended losses at the main TV operations.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. slumped 1.8 percent to
436 yen, the biggest drag on the Topix. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No.
2 and 3 publicly traded lenders, both dropped 1.2 percent. Banks
had the second-biggest drop in the Topix.  This week is the peak for quarterly results in Japan, with
more than a third of the Topix’s 1,668 companies scheduled to
report. Of the 693 that have published net income for the last
quarter, 95 have exceeded analysts’ estimates and 79 have missed
them, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Banks Decline  Ricoh, a maker of electronics devices, plunged 9.9 percent
to 1,052 yen after reporting third-quarter profit that missed
estimates of two analysts. The company said it earned 7.83
billion yen in the third-quarter. The most pessimistic of two
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for 10.4 billion yen.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut the investment rating to
“underweight” from “neutral.” Ricoh had the steepest drop in
the Nikkei 225, followed by Konami.  Konami, a video-game developer, tumbled 7.8 percent to
1,564 yen after today posting a 9.5 percent drop in nine-month
net income with falling sales.  Credit Saison Co., a consumer lender, lost 1.8 percent to
1,451 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported operating profit
at Credit Saison for the April-December period declined 45
percent from a year earlier.  Fast Retailing Co.,  Asia ’s biggest clothing chain, jumped
3.8 percent to 12,710, the biggest support of the Nikkei 225,
after saying sales at its Uniqlo stores in Japan rose for the
first time in six months boosted by its Heattech thermal
underwear and other winter items. Fast Retailing was the biggest
support to the Nikkei 225.  To contact the reporter on this story:
