Wheat rose for a second day in  South
Africa  after prices climbed in the U.S.  Wheat for March delivery, the most active contract on the
South African Futures Exchange, added 45 rand, or 1.4 percent,
to close at 3,325 rand ($463) a metric ton in Johannesburg.  Wheat for March delivery rose 27.25 cents, or 3.3 percent,
to close at $8.63 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade
yesterday on speculation that a cold snap in the U.S. Great
Plains will damage winter crops now in dormancy.  White corn for March delivery gained 24 rand, or 1.6
percent, to 1,508 rand a ton. Meal made from the grain is South
Africaâ€™s staple food.  Yellow corn for July delivery advanced 27.20 rand, or 1.7
percent, to 1,644.20 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as  animal feed  in South Africa.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
