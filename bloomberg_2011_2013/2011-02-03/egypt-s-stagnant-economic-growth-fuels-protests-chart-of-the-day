Egypt’s failure to boost economic
growth over the past two decades is fueling the social unrest
aimed at forcing the resignation of President  Hosni Mubarak .  The CHART OF THE DAY shows Egypt as the worst performer
among 13 Middle Eastern, North African and Gulf countries in
terms of per capita gross domestic product growth. While Egypt’s
growth per person stagnated between 1989 and 2008,  Turkey ’s has
risen 273 percent, and Lebanon is up 689 percent.  “The growing economy is not trickling down to the lower
mass of Egyptians, in addition to high unemployment, high
inflation, and the global financial crisis,” Mona Mansour,
director at CI Capital research, said by phone from Cairo. “GDP
per capita is definitely an indicator of unrest because it
indicates the masses of the population are not getting more
income to cope with inflationary pressures.”    Egypt ’s average GDP per capita was little changed at $2,160
in 2009, compared with $2,155 in 1989, according to
International Monetary Fund data.  Egypt’s largest opposition group rejected talks with
Mubarak yesterday after at least six protesters were killed in
Cairo’s Tahrir Square in the past two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
