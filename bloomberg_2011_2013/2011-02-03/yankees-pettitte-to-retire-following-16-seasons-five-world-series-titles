  Andy Pettitte  is retiring after a 16-
year career in which he won more postseason games than any
pitcher in Major League Baseball history and helped the  New York
Yankees  to five World Series championships.  Pettitte, a 38-year-old left-hander, will officially
announce his retirement tomorrow at a news conference at Yankee
Stadium, the team said in a news release.  The retirement decision was reported earlier today by ESPN.  Pettitte leaves with a 240-138 record and 3.88 earned run
average over 16 seasons, all but three of them in New York. A
two-time 20-game winner, he often was at his best in the
playoffs, with a record six series-clinching victories among 19
wins in the postseason.  “A person and player the caliber of Andy Pettitte does not
come around often, and he has earned the right to be considered
among the greats that have worn the pinstripes,” Yankees
Managing General Partner  Hal Steinbrenner  and General Partner
Hank Steinbrenner said in a statement.  Yankees officials including General Manager Brian Cashman
had said for months that there appeared to be little likelihood
of Pettitte returning for 2011. His departure leaves the team
with three proven starters -- CC Sabathia,  Phil Hughes  and A.J. Burnett.  Pettitte joined the Yankees in 1995, the same year as
catcher Jorge Posada, shortstop  Derek Jeter  and pitcher Mariano Rivera. Those four players, with 33 All-Star appearances among
them, formed the nucleus of a team that won World Series titles
in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. Pettitte signed with the  Houston Astros  in 2004, returning to the Yankees before the 2007
season.  Jeter and Rivera recently signed new contracts with the
Yankees, while Posada is entering the final year of his deal
with  New York .  Postseason Marks  Pettitte made a major league record 42 postseason starts,
38 with the Yankees, and was 19-10 with a 3.83 ERA. He was
selected as the 2001 American League Championship Series Most
Valuable Player after going 2-0 with a 2.54 ERA in two games
against the  Seattle Mariners .  In 2009, he became the second starting pitcher in history
to win series-clinching games in all three rounds of the
playoffs. Derek Lowe accomplished the feat in 2004 with the  Boston Red Sox .  Pettitte was one of several Yankees named in the 2007
Mitchell Report, the culmination of former Senator  George Mitchell ’s 21-month investigation into the use of performance-
enhancing drugs in baseball. The report mentioned that Pettitte
received human growth hormone injections in 2002 while
recovering from an elbow injury.  Pettitte verified the claims two days after the report was
released, saying that he used HGH to return to the team as
quickly as possible, and that he had never otherwise used growth
hormone or steroids. In 2008, Pettitte acknowledged before a
U.S. congressional committee that he used HGH during a second
span in 2004.  Last season, Pettitte was 11-3 with a 3.28 ERA, his lowest
since returning to the Yankees. His 203 wins with the franchise
are third most in club history, behind  Whitey Ford  (236) and Red
Ruffing (231), both members of baseball’s Hall of Fame.  To contact the reporter on this story:
