The prospects for investing in
Ugandan oil assets are “highly positive,” said the chief
executive officer of  Kenya  Petroleum Refineries Ltd.  A decision on where to invest will be done after an
assessment, said Bimal Kumar Mukherjee, who heads the company
that is joint-owned by  India ’s  Essar Energy Plc  and the Kenyan
government, today in an interview in Kampala, Uganda.  Uganda is emerging as an oil producer as U.K. explorer
Tullow Oil Plc is preparing to start pumping as much as 250,000
barrels a day by 2015 from a field in the Lake Albert Basin.
Tullow paid about $1.5 billion in July to Heritage Oil Plc for
interests in the basin and is waiting for approval from Uganda
amid a tax dispute, before it brings in China National Offshore
Oil Corp. and Total SA as partners.  The country will issue more oil-exploration licenses later
this year after a new industry law is formulated, Prime Minister
Apollo Nsibambi said yesterday at regional petroleum conference.  Prashant Ruia, Essar’s CEO, and Kenya’s former Foreign
Minister Moses Wetangula last year met Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to discuss building a refinery in  Uganda  as well a
pipeline, the Ugandan government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
