  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc .’s
Aurora Bank was sued by the Brooklyn Hospital Center.  The hospital wants to void a $309,750 mortgage loan on a
property to recoup an unpaid bill, according to a court filing
today in Lehman’s bankruptcy. Aurora should have known the
property was fraudulently transferred by the patient to a
relative to avoid creditors, the hospital said.  The hospital obtained a judgment of $240,993 against the
patient before the mortgage was recorded in county records, it
said.  The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
