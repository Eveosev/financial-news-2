U.S. stocks rose, erasing an earlier
decline, as retailers gained after sales exceeded projections
and jobless claims decreased by more than forecast.    Sears Holdings Corp . and Limited Brands Inc. jumped more
than 4.1 percent after Retail Metrics said industry retail sales
gained 4.4 percent in January, beating its 2.6 percent estimate.  AutoNation Inc ., the largest U.S. auto retailer, surged 11
percent as the largest U.S. auto retailer reported profit that
topped analysts’ estimates.  BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc . soared 14
percent after saying its board decided to evaluate strategic
options including a sale.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,307.10 at 4 p.m. in New York, rallying before the Labor
Department’s monthly jobs report tomorrow. The index fell 0.7
percent earlier after European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said inflation risks are “broadly balanced,”
dimming prospects for a rate increase. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  added 20.29 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,062.26 today.  “Consumer discretionary stocks are rocking,” said Michael Vogelzang, who helps manage $1.7 billion as president and chief
investment officer at Boston Advisors in Boston. “The numbers
from some of the more mainline retailers, Gap, Limited and Ross
Stores, have been pulling the market up all day clearly. The
market’s been mostly earnings driven. We had a couple of really
powerful earnings numbers and that’s leading the market here.”  Earnings  The Dow average closed above 12,000 for the first time
since June 2008 this week after U.S. and Chinese manufacturing
expanded and United Parcel Service Inc. beat analysts’ earnings
estimates. About 74 percent of the 266 companies in the S&P 500
that have reported results since Jan. 10 topped earnings-per-
share projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Labor Department figures showed that applications for
jobless benefits decreased by 42,000 to 415,000 in the week
ended Jan. 29. Economists forecast claims would fall to 420,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
total number of people receiving  unemployment insurance  and
those collecting extended payments decreased.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of  service
industries , which covers about 90 percent of the  U.S. economy ,
rose to 59.4 from December’s 57.1. The median forecast in a
survey of economists was 57.2, with estimates ranging from 54.5
to 62. Readings greater than 50 signal expansion.  “The economy has been shifting from recovery to
expansion,” said  David Goerz , the San Francisco-based chief
investment officer at Highmark Capital Management Inc., which
oversees $17 billion. “Earnings overall continue to accelerate.
That’s a great environment for stocks. Even after the sharp run,
stocks look cheap.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
