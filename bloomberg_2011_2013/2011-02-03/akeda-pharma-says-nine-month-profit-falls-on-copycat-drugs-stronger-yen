Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.,  Asia ’s
biggest drugmaker, reported a drop in nine-month profit for the
first time in two years as sales of its Prevacid heartburn pill
were eroded by copycat drugs and the stronger yen pared the
value of overseas revenue.  Net income dropped 17 percent to 215.5 billion yen ($2.64
billion) from 259.1 billion yen a year earlier, the Osaka,
Japan-based company said today in a statement. Sales fell 4.2
percent to 1.08 trillion yen.  The stronger yen cut 44.7 billion yen from sales in the
nine-month period, Takeda said. Japan’s currency averaged about
83 yen to the  U.S. dollar  in the three months ended Dec. 31 and
about 112 to the euro, compared with 90 yen and 133 yen a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A stronger yen
reduces the value of overseas sales when repatriated.  Takeda was unchanged at 4,010 yen at the 3 p.m. close on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange before the announcement, while the
benchmark Topix index declined 0.2 percent. The stock climbed
4.3 percent in 2010, the first annual gain in four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
