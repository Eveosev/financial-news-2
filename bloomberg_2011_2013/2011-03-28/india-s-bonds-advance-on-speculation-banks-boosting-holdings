India ’s 11-year bonds gained for a
fifth day on speculation banks will add to their holdings of
government debt to meet regulatory requirements before the
financial year ends this week.  Yields dropped to this year’s lowest level as lenders must
invest at least 24 percent of their deposits in finance ministry
notes and other approved securities. Banks have to declare their
bond holdings to the  Reserve Bank  of India at the end of each
quarter. Deposits rose to a record 51.4 trillion rupees as of
March 11, according to central bank data.  “There is good demand from banks to meet regulatory
requirements,” said A.Y. Shedshale, a Mumbai-based deputy
general manager at Bank of Maharashtra. “That is pushing yields
lower.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.01
percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. That is the lowest level since Dec. 29.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
decreased today. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive
floating rates, dropped two basis points to 7.44 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
