Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  fell the
most in eight months in London trading after  Zimbabwe  gave the
company and other foreign mine operators 45 days to explain how
they’ll meet government demands to sell stakes in local assets.  Aquarius dropped as much as 7.5 percent to 342.4 pence, the
biggest decline since July 19, and traded at 349.7 pence as of
8:07 a.m. London time. The shares sank 6 percent in
Johannesburg.  The Perth, Australia-based company said March 25 that its
Mimosa Mining Co. unit is in discussions with the Zimbabwean
authorities to find out how to comply with the country’s
legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
