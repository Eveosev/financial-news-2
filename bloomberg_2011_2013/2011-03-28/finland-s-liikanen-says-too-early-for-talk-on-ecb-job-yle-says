European Central Bank Council
Member Erkki Liikanen said it was too early to discuss who would
succeed  Jean-Claude Trichet  as president of the central bank,
the Finnish broadcaster YLE reported on its website.  “Trichet will continue in his job until the end of October
and we are still in the midst of very big and important
decisions ... It would be best not to rush things but to leave
them be until the stage where decisions have to be made. Now is
not the time,” Liikanen said in an interview with YLE according
to the broadcaster.   Asked whether he would say that the job is unusually
interesting, he answered, “And difficult,” YLE reported on the
website.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
