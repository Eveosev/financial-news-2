Coca-Cola  Japan  Co. is considering
importing  mineral water  from  South Korea  to meet demand in
Japanâ€™s Tohoku and Tokyo regions. The company initially plans to
secure 1 million cases of water for the affected areas,
according to a faxed statement today.  The Japanese government last week called on mineral water
suppliers to increase supply after tap water in the Tokyo area
was at one point found to have radioactive iodine levels higher
than the recommended limit for infants.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
