Miners and manufacturers in  Senegal 
should disconnect from the country’s over-burdened electricity
grid and generate their own power, Minister for Mines and
Industry Abdoulaye Balde told the Agence de Presse Senegalaise.  Soccocim, the local unit of French cement maker  SA des
Ciments Vicat (VCT) , has already disconnected from the network, Baldé
told the Dakar-based newswire.  Industries Chimique du Senegal, a producer of phosphoric
acids, will disconnect “soon,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
