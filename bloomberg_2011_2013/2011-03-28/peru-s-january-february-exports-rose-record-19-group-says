Peru ’s exports rose by a record 19
percent in the first two months of this year from a year earlier
as sales of gold, copper and natural gas jumped, an exporter
group said.  Exports rose to $6.05 billion during January and February,
 Comexperu  said in an e-mailed statement. The South American
country’s gold exports are likely to continue rising after the
prices for the precious metal surged to a record, the group
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
