Irish retail sales fell in February
as the country elected a new government that pledged to cut
spending and seek to have the interest payments on an 85
billion-euro ($119.4 billion) aid package reduced.  Retail sales declined 0.7 percent from a year earlier, the
 Central Statistics Office  in Cork said on its website today.
Sales rose 3.2 percent from January. Excluding cars, sales
dipped an annual 3.2 percent and a monthly 0.3 percent.  Ireland’s prime minister,  Enda Kenny , wants the 5.8 percent
interest rate on the European Union-led bailout last year
reduced as he tries to revive an economy that has shrunk by
about 15 percent since 2008. His government has pledged to cut
public spending to trim Ireland’s budget deficit.  Sales of furniture and lighting fell 12.9 percent in
February from a year earlier, the statistics office said. Sales
of fuel dropped 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
