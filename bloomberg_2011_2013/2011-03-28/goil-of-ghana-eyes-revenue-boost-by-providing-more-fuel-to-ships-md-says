Ghana  Oil Company Ltd., the West
African nation’s second-biggest operator of gas stations, plans
to expand its fuel operations for shipping as the country begins
to export crude, said Managing Director Yaw Agyemang-Duah.  Bunkering, as the process of supplying a ship with fuel is
known, may contribute “more than 10 percent” to the company’s
revenue this year as volume rises 24 percent to 38.9 million
liters, he said in an interview in Accra, the capital, March 24.
The business counted for just 10 percent of total revenue
between 2006 and 2010, he said.  “With the start of oil production at the Jubilee oil field
on Dec. 15, the opportunities for bunkering have increased and
we plan to take advantage of them,” he said.  Ghanaian companies, including consumer-goods makers and
financial institutions, are seeking ways to benefit from the
nascent  energy industry , which is expected to boost the
country’s economic growth by 13 percent this year, according to
the  International Monetary Fund .  Goil’s profit rose 20 percent to 6.3 million cedis ($4.1
million) in 2010 from a year earlier, the company said in a
statement published Feb. 7.  Shareholders will be asked to approve a rights offer at its
annual general meeting within the next two months, Agyemang-Duah
said, declining to say how much they hope to raise. The money
will be used to improve their aviation-fuel storage facilities
and other equipment at airports in Accra and Takoradi, the
Western regional capital that is near to Ghana’s offshore oil
fields.  Goil’s share price was unchanged at 30 pesewas in trading
on the Ghana Stock Exchange today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
