Botswana sold hunting packages to
shoot 27 elephants, the country’s Environment, Wildlife and
Tourism Ministry said.  The elephants chosen are considered to be “problem
animals” and the auction is part of efforts to control the
southern African nation’s 150,000 elephant population, the
Gaborone-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement. The
packages were sold for a total 5.6 million pula ($852,000).  To contact the reporter on this story:
