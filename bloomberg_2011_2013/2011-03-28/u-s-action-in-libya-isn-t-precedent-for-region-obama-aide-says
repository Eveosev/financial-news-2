The U.S. intervention in  Libya 
won’t set a precedent for taking action elsewhere in the region
where pro-democracy protests are challenging governments, Denis McDonough, deputy national security adviser, said  Each case is “unique,” McDonough said at a briefing.
Libya “doesn’t set a precedent that should create any
expectations” for other interventions in the Mideast or
elsewhere.  President Barack Obama is scheduled to address the nation
at 7:30 p.m.  Washington  time to lay out the justification for
military operations in Libya and answer criticism from lawmakers
that the mission and goals lack clarity.  The speech at the National Defense University in Washington
follows an agreement by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
to assume full command of all military operations as the
administration aims to protect civilians while urging Libyan
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  to leave office.  Turmoil has spread across North African and Middle Eastern
countries including Yemen, Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Syria
and Bahrain.  Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said yesterday the U.S.
won’t enter into the internal conflict in Syria, where
government forces and protesters have clashed.  “We expect the Syrian government to respect the rights of
Syrians,” McDonough said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
