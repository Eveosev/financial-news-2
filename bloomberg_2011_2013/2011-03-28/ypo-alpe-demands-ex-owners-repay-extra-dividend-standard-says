Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank International
AG, the lender nationalized by  Austria  in 2009, is demanding
former owners repay a 50 million euro ($70 million) extra
dividend, Austrian daily newspaper  Der Standard  reported today.  The Austrian province of Carinthia, insurer Grazer
Wechselseitige Versicherung AG and a group of investors led by
wealth manager Tilo Berlin have until April 7 to pay back the
dividend, Der Standard said, citing a letter sent to the ex-
owners on behalf of the bank by Austriaâ€™s Attorney General.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
