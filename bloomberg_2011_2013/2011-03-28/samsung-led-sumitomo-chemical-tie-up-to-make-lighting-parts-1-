Samsung LED Co., a South Korean
manufacturer of light-emitting diodes, will form a venture with
Sumitomo Chemical Co. to make components for energy-efficient
lights used in televisions and monitors.  The two companies will invest a combined 80 billion won
($72 million) and have an equal stake in the venture, the South
Korean manufacturer said in a statement on its website today.
The venture will start mass production of sapphire ingots and
wafers used in light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, in early 2012.  Securing parts supply is important as demand for LEDs,
which are brighter and consume less power than conventional
fluorescent lights, will likely continue to outstrip supply for
sapphire wafers, Samsung LED said.  Closely held Samsung LED is a joint venture between Samsung
Electronics Co. and Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
