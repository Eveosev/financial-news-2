Asia and  Russia  will outpace
universities in the rest of the world in producing petroleum
engineers as national oil companies step up recruiting,
 Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) ’s business consulting unit said.  Four-fifths of the world’s oil engineer graduates will come
from Asia and from former Soviet states, with  China  alone
accounting for 30 percent, Schlumberger said in its Oil & Gas HR
Benchmark survey  published in Paris  today. The industry will
lose about 5,000 engineers by 2014 as the generation hired
before cuts in the 1980s retires.  “There are real regional tensions as Brazil and the Middle
East don’t produce enough engineers” for the size of their
industries, said Antoine Rostand, managing director of
Schlumberger Business Consulting, in a telephone interview.
“People joining the industry now will have a lot of
opportunities to grow very fast.”  Oil and gas production in  Asia  and Russia tends to be more
labor-intensive than in other regions with more developed
industries, partly accounting for the higher number of
graduates, Rostand said. The “big crew change” from the loss
of more experienced engineers may lead to delays in projects
because of staffing issues, the report showed.  Schlumberger surveyed more than 50 companies and 80
universities. The survey started in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
