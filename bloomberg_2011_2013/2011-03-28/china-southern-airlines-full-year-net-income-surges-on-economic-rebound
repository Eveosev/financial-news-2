China  Southern Airlines Co., the
nation’s biggest carrier, boosted profit almost 18-fold last
year as renewed global economic growth spurred travel and
freight demand.  Net income climbed to 5.8 billion yuan ($883 million) in
2010, from 330 million yuan a year earlier, the Guangzhou-based
company said in Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday. That
compares with the 5.7 billion yuan average of 15 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales increased 40 percent to
76.5 billion yuan.  The airline’s passenger numbers climbed 15 percent last
year as worldwide travel rebounded from the global recession and
as rising wages in China stoked domestic demand. The nation will
probably lead a 32 percent jump in global passenger traffic in
the five years ending 2014, according to the  International Air
Transport Association .  China Southern, which flew 76.5 million passengers last
year, also benefited from the yuan’s 3.4 percent appreciation
against last year, which pared the value of dollar-denominated
debts built up from buying Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS planes.  The carrier earns 80 percent of revenue in yuan, while 90
percent of debt is denominated in the U.S. currency,  Jim Wong 
and Shirley Lam, analysts at Nomura International (HK) Ltd.,
wrote in a March 7 report. The airline will probably be the
biggest beneficiary of domestic demand and an estimated 5.6
percent appreciation of the yuan this year, they said.  Air China Ltd. (753) , the world’s largest carrier by market
value, and China Eastern Airlines Corp., will probably also post
rising profits when they report this week.  China Southern’s 2011 profit may fall to 4.5 billion yuan,
according to the average of 15 analyst estimate compiled by
Bloomberg. Jet kerosene prices have risen 27 percent this year
in Singapore to $132.50 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.  China Southern fell 2.5 percent to HK$3.52 in Hong Kong
trading yesterday, before the earnings announcement. In
 Shanghai , China Southern slipped 0.1 percent to 8.27 yuan.  Of 22 analysts tracked by Bloomberg in the past 12 months,
11 recommended that investors “buy” China Southern’s Hong
Kong-listed stock, seven had “hold” ratings and the remainder
said “sell.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
