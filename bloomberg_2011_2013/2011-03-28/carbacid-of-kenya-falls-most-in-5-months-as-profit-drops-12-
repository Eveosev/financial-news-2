Carbacid Investments Ltd. (CBIL) , a Kenyan
carbon-dioxide maker, fell the most in more than two weeks after
saying first-half profit dropped 12 percent as sales declined.  The shares retreated 6 shillings, or 4 percent, to 143
shillings at the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the weakest since
March 11.  Net income dropped to 136.9 million shillings ($1.62
million) in the six months through January, from 155.7 million
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said March
25 after the close of trading. Sales were 10 percent lower at
290.6 million shillings, it said.  “Management expects the second half to be more challenging
given the increase in costs of fuel, electricity and other
inputs,” Nairobi-based African Alliance Kenya Securities Ltd.
