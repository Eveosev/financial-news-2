a two-week high, rallying 6 kobo, or 4.1 percent, to 1.54 naira
after yesterday announcing a planned merger with Access
Bank Plc to create the country’s fourth-biggest bank by assets.  The merger “is a welcome development as it reduces
systemic risk,” in Nigeria’s banking industry,  Bismarck Rewane ,
chief executive officer of Lagos-based Financial Derivatives
Co., a brokerage, said by phone today. “The alternative would
have been to liquidate Intercontinental, which would be risky to
the economy.”  Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM)  , Kenya’s biggest mobile-network
operator, gained for the first day in three, rising 5 cents, or
1.3 percent, to 4 shillings on speculation earnings in the year
through March will increase.  “We are approaching the year-end on March 31,” Eric
Musau, an analyst at Nairobi-based African Alliance Securities
Kenya Ltd., said by phone today. “We are estimating a small
increase in profitability, despite all the challenges.” Earnings
per share are estimated to rise 8.6 percent, Musau said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
