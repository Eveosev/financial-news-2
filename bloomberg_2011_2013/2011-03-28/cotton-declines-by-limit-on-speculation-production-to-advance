Cotton declined by the most allowed
by the exchange in  New York  on that speculation global
production next season will climb, easing supply concerns.  May-delivery cotton slumped as much as 7 cents, or 3.4
percent to $1.9749 a pound on the ICE Futures U.S., before
trading at $1.99 at 11:55 a.m. in  London . Cotton has more
than doubled in the past year.  The fiber may plunge to $1 per pound by Dec. 31, according
to the median in a Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts and traders.
Global  plantings  were estimated to rise 7 percent to 36 million
hectares, the biggest area in 17 years, taking output to a
record 27.6 million metric tons in the year from Aug. 1, the
 International Cotton Advisory Committee  said on March 1.  “These prices may come under pressure because of an
expected large global production response in 2011-2012,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, wrote in a report e-mailed today.  Cotton surged to a record $2.197 a pound in New York on
March 7 as global supply tightened. The commodity has surged 37
percent this quarter, making it the best performer on the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index, which tracks 19
commodities.  In the week to March 22,  hedge funds  and other money
managers cut bets on higher prices 64 percent from a September
peak, the steepest drop since 2008. Their wagers declined for
seven consecutive weeks, the longest stretch since at least June
2006, and total 29,185 contracts, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. One contract equals 50,000 pounds.  Output will beat demand by 1.2 million tons in the next
crop year, Cotlook Ltd., an industry researcher, said in
February. Global production may rise 11 percent to 127.5
million,
480-pound bales in the year from Aug. 1 as demand gains 3
percent to 120 million bales, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
