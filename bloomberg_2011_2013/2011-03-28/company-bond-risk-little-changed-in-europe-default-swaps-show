The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default was little changed, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 1
basis point to 387, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 10:30
a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and an increase signals
deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 0.25 basis points to 102.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers climbed 0.5 basis point to 147.5 basis
points and the subordinated index fell 1 to 264.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
