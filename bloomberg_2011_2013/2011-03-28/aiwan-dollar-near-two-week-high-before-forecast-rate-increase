Taiwan ’s dollar traded near a two-
week high, supported by expectations the central bank will raise
 interest rates  for the fourth time in a year.  The Central Bank of the Republic of  China  (Taiwan) will
raise its discount rate on 10-day loans by 12.5 basis points to
1.75 percent on March 31, according to all but one of 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. One forecast an increase of
twice that size. Concern about radiation leaks at a crippled
nuclear power plant in  Japan  is weighing on demand for regional
assets, according to Eric Hsing, a debt trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei.  “The nuclear risk in Japan had an impact on the currency
and stock market today,” Hsing said. “Taiwan’s yield premium
over the U.S. may attract more foreign investors, driving gains
in the currency.”  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.499 against the
greenback as of the 4 p.m. local time close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.440 on March 25, the
strongest level since March 10, and has appreciated 2.9 percent
this year. The Taiex index of shares fell 0.7 percent, snapping
a six-day advance.  Government bonds  fell for a third day. The yield on the
1.375 percent bond due March 2021 gained one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.365 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
