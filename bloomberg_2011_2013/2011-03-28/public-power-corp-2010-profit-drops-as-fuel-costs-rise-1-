Public Power Corp SA (PPC) ,  Greece ’s
largest electricity producer, posted a 64 percent drop in first-
quarter profit on higher energy costs and said full-year revenue
is likely to decline 2.5 percent on lower electricity sales.  Net income dropped to 93.3 million euros ($132.2 million)
from 257.5 million euros in the year earlier period, according
to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-based company today.
Revenue declined 7.7 percent to 1.38 billion euros while
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
fell 37 percent to 327.7 million euros.  “First-quarter results reflect the increase of the energy
balance cost and the negative impact from the remaining
distortions in the retail market,” Chief Executive Officer
Arthouros Zervos said in the statement. Energy purchase expenses
rose 47 percent to 194.8 million euros.  Revenue from electricity sales, including exports,
decreased 9 percent as the company’s Greek market share declined
to 93.4 percent from 98.1 percent. For the full year,
electricity sales are seen dropping as much as 4 percent, the
company said.  PPC, which is 51 percent owned by the Greek state, must
adapt to new  electricity market  conditions during this difficult
economic environment, Zervos said. Greece’s government plans to
reduce its stake to 17 percent next year as part of a stepped-up
state-asset sales program and is under pressure to open up the
electricity market under conditions of a European Union lead
bailout last May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
