Lamprell Plc (LAM) , an oil and gas rig
builder active in the Middle East, rose to the highest in two
months after doubling profit and reporting a record order
backlog.  Shares of the Douglas, Isle of Man-based company rose 5.4
percent to close at 331 pence in London. Profit rose 135 percent
to $67 million in 2010, and the order book stood at $962 million
at the end of February, the company said in a statement today.  Lamprell has benefited from a global increase in demand for
new rigs after the blowout last year at BP Plc’s Macondo well in
the  Gulf of Mexico . Brent crude prices are also more than 40
percent higher than a year ago, encouraging explorers to spend
more on drilling.  “Macondo triggered a surge in the market for new-builds,”
Lamprell Chief Executive Officer Nigel McCue said in a telephone
interview. “We’re very positive about 2011. We’ll certainly see
an increase in revenue through the year based on the backlog
we’ve got.”  Lamprell shares have gained about 35 percent in the past
year, valuing the company at 663 million pounds ($1.1 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
