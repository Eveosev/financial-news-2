OAO Transneft plans to spend 161.2
billion rubles ($5.7 billion) this year building new pipelines,
Vedomosti reported today.                                
  The Russian oil pipeline operator had classified annual
capital expenditure forecasts as secret until the end of last
year when the government forced it to dislose the numbers, as
well as some information on tariffs and oil quality, the
newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
