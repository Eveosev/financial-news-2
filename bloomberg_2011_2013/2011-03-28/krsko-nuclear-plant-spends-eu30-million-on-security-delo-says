Slovenia’s  nuclear power plant  in
Krsko has invested about 30 million euros ($42 million) a year
into security systems to reduce the risk of an accident,  Delo
 reported.  The plant, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of Zagreb,
plans to strengthen levies along the river Sava to reduce the
risk of flooding, the Ljubljana-based newspaper said, citing
Stanislav Rozman, the plant’s chairman of the management board.  To lower the risk of damage from an earthquake, the
facility is installing an independent, diesel powered generator
that will be operational next year, Delo said.  The Krsko plant, jointly owned by Slovenia and  Croatia , has
been idle since March 23 due to a power-line outage and will be
back online later this week, a spokeswoman for the facility said
last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
