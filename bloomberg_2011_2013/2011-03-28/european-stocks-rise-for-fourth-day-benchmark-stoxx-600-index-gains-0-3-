European stocks gained for a fourth
day as U.S. consumer spending topped forecasts and a Federal
Reserve official said the economy may be strong enough to
consider ending stimulus.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.3 percent to 276.82 at 3:21 p.m. in
 London  after earlier dropping 0.2 percent. The gauge rallied 3.1
percent last week, the most in six months, as investors
speculated that  Japan  would prevent further radiation leaks from
its stricken nuclear plant and the  U.S. economy  grew at a
faster-than-forecast pace.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
