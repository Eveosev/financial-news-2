Yields on most of  Brazil ’s
interest-rate futures contracts fell as economists lowered their
year-end forecast for the benchmark overnight rate.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2012, the
most traded today in Sao Paulo, dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 12.20 percent. The yield on the
contract due in July declined two basis points to 11.95 percent.  Economists forecast the Selic, Brazil’s benchmark overnight
rate, will be 12.25 percent at year-end, down from a previous
forecast of 12.5 percent, according to the median prediction in
a March 25 central bank survey of about 100 analysts published
today. Inflation may be 5.45 percent in the next 12 months,
compared with a week-earlier forecast of 5.36 percent, according
to the survey.  “It’s clear that this is a scenario of lower interest-rate
hikes,” said  Andre Perfeito , chief economist at Gradual
Investimentos in Sao Paulo.  The survey came after the central bank signaled it may
adopt measures to curb credit growth other than raising
borrowing costs. In the minutes of its March 1-2 policy meeting,
published March 10, policy makers said so-called “macro-
prudential measures” to curb bank lending are a “rapid and
potent” weapon.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini said March 25 that
inflation forecasts may “worsen” in the short term as analysts
absorb the residual impact from a rally in commodity prices.  Quarterly Report  Investors expect the central bank to use its quarterly
inflation report, to be released March 30, as a platform to
argue that it can curb inflation without added interest-rate
increases, said Dirk Willer, head of Latin America local markets
strategy at Citigroup Inc. in  New York .  Brazil’s real fell 0.1 percent to 1.6629 per dollar, from
1.6620 on March 25.  Policymakers said they twice bought dollars in the  spot
market  today, at 1.6600 reais and then at 1.6619 reais each. The
central bank also auctioned all 16,500 reverse currency swap
contracts due June 11 offered today, according to a statement.  Regular dollar purchases are part of an effort by policy
makers to stem gains in the currency, which has strengthened 39
percent since the end of 2008, the most among emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg over the period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
