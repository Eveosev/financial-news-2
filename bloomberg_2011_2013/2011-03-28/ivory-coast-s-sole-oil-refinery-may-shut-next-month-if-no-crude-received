Ivory Coast ’s sole oil refinery may
have to close next month as sanctions imposed on the West
African nation following a disputed election on Nov. 28 starve
it of crude and the money to acquire it.  “By mid-April if we have no crude the whole refinery will
be shut down,” Joel Dervain, managing director of the  Societe
Ivoirienne de Raffinage  plant, said in an interview in  Cape Town 
today. “We have no financial means to purchase the crude
because all the assets were frozen. We have been under
sanctions. We have filed legal proceedings. We are waiting for
the results.”  Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, has been
gripped by a political crisis since the electoral commission
named  Alassane Ouattara  the winner of the presidential elections
and incumbent  Laurent Gbagbo  refused to cede power. The European
Union on Jan. 14 banned transactions between the bloc and
several industries in Ivory Coast in an attempt to starve Gbagbo
of funds.  The country’s refinery is situated in the commercial
capital, Abidjan, and has the capacity to process about 80,000
barrels of crude a day. The plant is currently operating at a
rate of 25,000 to 30,000 barrels and is fast depleting its
stockpiled crude, Dervain said.  Ivory Coast’s government has a 28 percent stake in the
refinery, while Burkina Faso’s government holds 5 percent.  Total
SA (FP)  owns another 25 percent and Sonangol SA, Angola’s state-owned
oil company, has 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
