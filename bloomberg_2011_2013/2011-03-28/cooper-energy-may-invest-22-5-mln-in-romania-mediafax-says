(Corrects currency in first paragraph from report published
yesterday.)  Cooper Energy Ltd. (COE) , an Australian
oil and gas explorer, may invest as much as $16 million euros in
developing a natural  gas field  in Romania,  Mediafax  reported
today, citing a   Zeta Petroleum L td. press release.  Cooper Energy is currently exploiting the southern Romanian
Bobocu gas field, which has an estimated output of 1.7 billion
cubic meters of gas, together with Zeta, a U.K.-based private
company, according to the Bucharest-based news service.  The two companies have extracted 935 million cubic meters
of gas from the Bobocu field, until last year, Mediafax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
