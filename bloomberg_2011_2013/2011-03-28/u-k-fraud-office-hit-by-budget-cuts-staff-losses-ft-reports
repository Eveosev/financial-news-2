The U.K. Serious Fraud Office is
threatened by shrinking budgets, staff resignations and a
planned reorganization by the government, the Financial Times
reported, citing Richard Alderman, the director, and others
inside and outside the agency.  The SFO’s budget has dropped 26 percent, to 39.5 million
pounds ($63 million) since the 2009-09 fiscal year and is due to
be cut by another 25 percent, to 30.5 million pounds, by 2014-
15, the newspaper said.  The organization’s future is in doubt; a government plan to
incorporate it into a new economic crime agency has changed
several times and the SFO’s prosecutors and investigators may be
split between different bodies, the FT said.  Six prominent staff members, including the heads of policy
and anti-corruption, have quit in the past few months, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
