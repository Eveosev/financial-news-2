Rift Valley Railways, the operator
of the Kenya- Uganda  rail line, plans to raise $240 million over
the next five years to fund its expansion, said an investor in
the company.  The additional capital will supplement an existing $54
million bank facility and enable Rift Valley Railways to expand
its operations in both countries, Gachao Kiuna, chief executive
officer of TransCentury Ltd., said in an interview today in
Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. RVR, as the company is called, has
a 25-year concession to operate and manage the rail line.  “We are looking to raise $240 million to be deployed in
the next five years as part of our investments to modernize RVR
operations,” Kiuna said.  RVR plans to raise $100 million in loans from commercial
banks and $140 million from the three main shareholders in the
company, he said. Citadel Capital Corp. of  Egypt  owns 51 percent
of RVR, while TransCentury holds 34 percent and Bomi Holdings of
Uganda has 15 percent.  “RVR does not have a  credit rating  currently, though it
may seek to have one in the future,” Judy Achar, RVR
spokeswoman, said in a phone interview in Nairobi.  Kenya has been rated B+ by both Standard and Poor’s and
Fitch Rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
