Advantest Corp. (6857) , the world’s
second-largest maker of semiconductor-testing equipment, agreed
to buy  Verigy Ltd. (VRGY)  for $1.1 billion in the company’s biggest
acquisition.  Advantest will acquire all shares of the Singapore-based
company at $15 a share, the Tokyo-based equipment maker said in
a statement today. The all-cash offer is subject to Verigy
shareholders’ approval, it said.  The acquisition will make Advantest the world’s biggest
manufacturer of equipment for testing semiconductors, overtaking
North Reading, Massachusetts-based  Teradyne Inc. (TER)  Shares of
Verigy, which had sought a friendly merger with  LTX-Credence
Corp. (LTXCD)  in November, have gained 60 percent in the past four
months, as the Japanese company raised its unsolicited takeover-
bid from $12.15 a share.  Verigy specializes in testing machines for non-memory
chips, supplementing Advantest’s expertise, the statement said.
Advantest will also strengthen its global operations through the
acquisition, it said.  Advantest fell 1.3 percent to close at 2,600 yen in Tokyo
trading today. Verigy rose 0.2 percent to close at $14.18 on the
Nasdaq Stock Market on March 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
