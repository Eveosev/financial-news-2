Colombia’s peso fell to a one-week
low as local companies bought foreign currency and the central
bank continued with its plan to buy dollars.  The peso declined 0.4 percent to 1,878.68 per  U.S. dollar 
at 3:18 p.m. New York time, from 1,870.73 on March 25. Earlier,
it touched 1,881.30, its weakest intraday level since March 17.
The peso has gained 1.5 percent this year.  “Financial intermediaries are short on dollars, meaning
they have to go out and buy to avoid short dollar positions,”
said  Camilo Perez , head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the
country’s second-biggest bank. Colombian rules don’t allow
financial intermediaries, including banks, to have negative
dollar positions.  Colombia’s central bank said last month it will continue to
buy a minimum of $20 million daily in the local market until
“at least” June 17 in a bid to ease gains in the peso,
extending a program that started in September and was originally
set to expire this month.  The yield on the Colombian government’s benchmark 11
percent bonds due July 2020 was little changed at 8.33 percent,
according to  Colombia ’s stock exchange. The bond’s price fell
0.016 centavo to 116.754 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
