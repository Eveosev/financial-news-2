Sepp Blatter said he’ll stick to
FIFA’s current budget until 2015 should he be re-elected for a
fourth term as president of soccer’s global governing body.  Mohamed Bin Hammam, who is challenging the Swiss national
in the June 1 vote, has said he’d double the $250,000 that each
of FIFA’s 208 national member associations get each year.
Blatter said only FIFA’s governing panel can change funding as
he dismissed the offer from the 61-year-old Qatari, who runs
 Asia ’s soccer federation. Blatter, 75, has run FIFA since 1998.  “We’ve already made the budget” for 2011-15, Blatter
said. “If you give only money and you don’t control where the
money is going, this is not a good gift.”  Member countries can expect more money from FIFA under a
fourth-term Blatter presidency for specific “development
programs” and initiatives to ensure every country has at least
one playing field and a stadium for international matches.  Any increase in annual allowances to members “could only
be done by the congress,” he said.  The FIFA congress meets at least once a year where each
member association has a vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
