Utilities in the U.K. are likely to
shutter coal-fired  power plants  earlier than previously planned
after the country set a minimum price for  carbon emissions ,
according to Matrix Group analysts.  Four plants including E.ON AG’s Kingsnorth plant, RWE AG’s
Tilbury and Didcot power stations and Iberdrola SA’s Cockenzie
facility may close by 2013 rather than 2015, Matrix analyst Adam Forsyth said in a note today.  Britain has about 11,400 megawatts of fossil-fueled power
stations due to close under European environmental legislation
by the end of 2015. The plants must shut after using the 20,000
additional operating hours they were allocated. Early plant
closures, coupled with higher gas and electricity prices, could
boost power plants’ profit margins known as dark spreads for
coal generation and spark spreads for gas production.  “We expect spark and dark spreads to widen after 2013 and
again after 2015 due to closures,” Forsyth said.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  announced a so-
called carbon-price support in his annual budget presentation
last week in  London . The floor price will be 16 pounds a ton of
carbon dioxide, rising to 30 pounds by 2020. documents released
on March 23 showed the Treasury will charge utilities a tax of
4.94 pounds a ton in 2013.  Drax Plc, which owns the biggest coal-fired plant in the
U.K., has fallen 3.1 percent since the carbon floor was
announced at traded at 397.1 pence in London. That values Drax
at 1.45 billion pounds ($2.32 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
