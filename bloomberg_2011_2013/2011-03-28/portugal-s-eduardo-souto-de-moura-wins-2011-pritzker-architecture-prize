Portugal ’s Eduardo Souto de Moura,
who has designed soccer stadiums, museums and office towers in
his home country, is the winner of this year  Pritzker
Architecture Prize , the highest honor for architects.  Among his best-known buildings are the soccer stadium in
Braga, Portugal, where European soccer teams fought for the
championship in 2004; and the 20-story Burgo Tower office block
in his native city of Porto, built in 2007. Souto de Moura, 58,
has also built family homes, cinemas, shopping centers and
hotels and since setting up his own office in 1980.  Jury Chairman Peter Palumbo said Souto de Moura “has
produced a body of work that is of our time but also carries
echoes of architectural traditions,” according to a statement
today from the Hyatt Foundation, which awards the prize.  “He has the confidence to use stone that is a thousand
years old or to take inspiration from a modern detail by Mies
van der Rohe,” the statement said.  Souto de Moura worked for fellow Portuguese architect
Alvaro Siza for five years before founding his own company. Siza
won the Pritzker Prize in 1992.  Other previous winners of the prize, which is worth
$100,000, include  Norman Foster , Rem Koolhaas and  Frank Gehry .
The Hyatt Foundation established the prize in 1979 to honor a
living architect.  To contact the writer on the story:
