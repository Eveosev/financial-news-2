Greece  will reduce investment
spending at state-run companies and will impose additional
benefit and wage cuts for employees,  Eleftherotypia  reported,
without citing anyone.  The moves are part of measures to be decided in April with
the European Union and  International Monetary Fund  designed to
achieve a further savings of as much as 2.2 billion euros ($3.1
billion) in 2011, the Athens-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
