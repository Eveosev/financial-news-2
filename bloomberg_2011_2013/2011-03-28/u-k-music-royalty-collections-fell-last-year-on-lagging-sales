(Corrects amount paid to songwriters in second paragraph.)  PRS For Music , the agency
collecting British music royalties, garnered fewer fees last
year as sales of CDs and DVDs slumped and digital revenue
slowed.  The group took in 611.2 million pounds ($975.6 million)
last year, after 618.2 million pounds the year before, PRS For
Music said in an e-mail yesterday. Even with the decline, the
amount paid to songwriters, composers and music publishers fell
only by 800,000 pounds because of administration cuts at the
collection agency, it said.  The closure of some music retailers, combined with slower
physical sales and difficulties “capturing the value of music
usage online” resulted in the first-ever decline in royalties
collected by PRS,” said Robert Ashcroft, the group’s chief.  Record companies  have been licensing online music services
such as Spotify and Rdio and relying on premium ads around
online videos to help make up for a drop in CD sales as more
retail shops shutter and online piracy shows no signs of waning.  Before 2010, declines in physical sales were countered by
revenue from music licensing in both the U.K. and abroad,
Ashcroft said. “In 2010, slower growth at home and abroad
failed to fully mitigate the decline,” he said.  Royalties from recorded media, mainly CDs and DVDs fell 8.8
percent and growth in fees collected from online music services
slowed to 4.3 percent, PRS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
