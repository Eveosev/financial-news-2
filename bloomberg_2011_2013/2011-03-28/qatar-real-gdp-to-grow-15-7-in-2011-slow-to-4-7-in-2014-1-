Qatar, the world’s fastest-growing
economy, expects real gross domestic product to expand 4.7
percent in 2014 and 2015, more than the 4 percent pace forecast
for 2013, according to the nation’s five-year development plan.  The Gulf nation forecasts real GDP growth of 15.7 percent
this year, slowing to 7.1 percent in 2012, according to the
report released today in the capital, Doha. The slowdown comes
as Qatar invests less in its hydrocarbon industry and economic
benefits from expenditures for the soccer  World Cup , which the
country is to host in 2022, come after 2016, the report said.  Qatar expects domestic investment in the five years to 2016
to total 820 billion riyals ($225 billion), half of which will
be spent in the hydrocarbon industry, according to the report
issued by the state-run General Secretariat for Development
Planning. Public-sector investment will account for 347 billion
riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
