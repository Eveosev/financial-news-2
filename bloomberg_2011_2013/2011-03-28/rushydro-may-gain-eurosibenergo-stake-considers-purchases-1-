OAO RusHydro,  Russia ’s largest
renewable energy producer, may gain a stake in billionaire Oleg
Deripaska’s power generator EuroSibEnergo, Chief Executive
Officer Yevgeny Dod said.  RusHydro  is considering a conversion of its 40 percent of
OAO Irkutskenergo and 25 percent in Krasnoyarsk hydropower plant
into a stake in EuroSibEnergo, Dod told reporters in Moscow
today. EuroSibEnergo has controlling stakes in the two
companies.  The utility and Deripaska’s United Co. Rusal, the world’s
biggest aluminum smelter, are also discussing the possibility of
production-sharing agreements or dividing assets on geographical
lines, Dod said. RusHydro’s board will soon decide on the form
of its cooperation with Deripaska’s companies, Dod said.
EuroSibEnergo supplies electricity to Rusal.  Separately, RusHydro is seeking acquisitions in  China ,
 Southeast Asia  and  India , and is continuing talks with several
Chinese companies about share swaps, Dod told reporters. He
declined to elaborate on the talks.  Dod said RusHydro can obtain a controlling stake in  RAO ES
Vostoka , an isolated power generating company in the  Far East ,
paying additional shares upon governmental approval, according
to the Interfax news service.  In the near future, RusHydro will select banks for a
planned sale this year of 15 billion rubles ($528 million) of
debt, which may be structured as Eurobonds, Dod said. The
utility may borrow another 15 billion rubles, he said, without
giving a time frame.  To contact the reporter on this story:
