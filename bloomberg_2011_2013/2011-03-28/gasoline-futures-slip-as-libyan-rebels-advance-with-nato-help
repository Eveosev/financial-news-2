Gasoline fell along with crude
after Libyan rebels gained ground, easing concern that oil
exports will be disrupted for an extended period.  Futures declined as rebels in  Libya  advanced westward with
support from NATO airstrikes on Sirte, the hometown of  Muammar Qaddafi . The unrest in Libya, holder of Africa’s largest crude
reserves, helped push gasoline up 22 percent from Feb. 15 to
March 25.  “The market is still looking for a trigger to continue its
rally,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition
Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “Without signs of further
unrest in the Middle East, the market’s having trouble moving
higher.”  Gasoline for April delivery dropped 1.71 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $3.0274 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Gasoline settled 0.25 cent higher than heating oil, the
first time gasoline has been at a premium since Aug. 2.  Brent dropped 79 cents to $114.80 a barrel on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Product futures are vulnerable to
changes in Brent because refineries supplying fuel to  New York 
Harbor, the delivery point for heating oil and gasoline futures,
process crude grades priced relative to the European benchmark.  “It looks like we’re back to following Brent,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Gasoline Supplies  U.S. gasoline inventories probably fell 2 million barrels
last week, according to the median estimate of nine analysts in
a survey by Bloomberg News. Stockpiles in the week ended March
18 sank 5.32 million barrels to 219.7 million, the fifth
straight drop and the lowest level in 11 weeks, according to
Energy Department data.  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
dropped 1 million barrels last week, according to the survey,
after gaining 7,000 barrels to 152.6 million the prior week. The
Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s inventories
on March 30.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 0.6 cent to $3.584 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its
website. That’s the highest price since Oct. 2, 2008.  Heating oil for April delivery dropped 2.99 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $3.0249 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
