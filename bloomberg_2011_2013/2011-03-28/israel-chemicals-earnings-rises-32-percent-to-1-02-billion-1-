Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) , which
extracts minerals from the Dead Sea to make fertilizer, said
fourth-quarter profit surged 21 percent as potash sales volumes
and prices increased.  Net income rose to $245.4 million from $202.7 million in
the year-earlier period, the company said in a statement to the
 Tel Aviv  stock exchange today. Annual profit increased 32
percent to $1.02 billion. Revenue for 2010 climbed 25 percent to
$5.69 billion as potash sales doubled.  Prices for agricultural nutrients such as potassium,
nitrogen and phosphorus are increasing, as growing demand for
food and unfavorable weather put a strain on global supplies of
wheat, corn and soybeans. Potash, a form of potassium, climbed
to about $606 a ton at the end of 2010, 13 percent more than at
the end of September, according to a Bloomberg index of U.S.
Midwest retail prices.  “Low channel inventory and rising grain prices led to a
real recovery of the potash market,” said Gilad Alper, a Tel
Aviv-based senior analyst at Meitav Investment House Ltd. Potash
is mainly used to boost yields of rice, sugar cane, fruit and
vegetables. India is the world’s second-biggest producer of
rice, wheat and sugar.  Annual sales to the Asian market soared 46 percent, to
 Europe  32 percent and to  South America  14 percent in 2010, the
Tel Aviv-based company said. “Israel Chemicals sees India,
 China  and Brazil as strategically important markets as they have
a significant growth potential,” it said today.  The shares rose 1.7 percent to 60 shekels at the 4:30 p.m.
close in Tel Aviv. They have gained 19 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
