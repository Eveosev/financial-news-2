TransCentury Ltd., a Kenyan
investment company that plans to list on the domestic stock
exchange, said full-year profit doubled as revenue climbed.  Net income jumped to 468.3 million shillings ($80.5
million) in the 12 months through December from 234.5 million
shilling a year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement published in the Daily Nation newspaper today. Revenue
rose 26 percent to 6.79 billion shillings, it said.  TransCentury said it appointed advisers to consider its
listing on the stock market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
