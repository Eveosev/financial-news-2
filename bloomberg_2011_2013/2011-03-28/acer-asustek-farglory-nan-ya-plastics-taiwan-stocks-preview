Acer said on March 25.  Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)  (2357 TT) declined 5.7 percent to
NT$239, the lowest since Feb. 11. The maker of low-cost

bit” after the March 11 earthquake, Chairman Jonney Shih said
in Taipei on March 25.  Nan Ya Plastics Corp. (1303)  (1303 TT) climbed 1.1 percent to
NT$84.5, the biggest gain since March 16. The world’s largest

stock exchange on March 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
