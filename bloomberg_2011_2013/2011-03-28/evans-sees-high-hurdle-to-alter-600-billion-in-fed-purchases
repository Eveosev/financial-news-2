President  Charles Evans  said he expects the Fed to complete its
plan to purchase $600 billion in U.S. Treasuries through June.  “It could be that $600 billion is just about the right
number,” Evans said to reporters before a speech in Columbia,
South Carolina. “I won’t be surprised if that in fact is the
decision. I still think it is a high hurdle to stop short of
$600 billion. So far I haven’t seen it.”  The Fed’s policy committee said March 15 that the U.S.
economic recovery “is on a firmer footing,” while the labor
market is “improving gradually.” Policy makers reiterated
their intent to buy bonds through June to bolster growth and
reduce unemployment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
