Co-operative Group Ltd., a mutually
owned U.K. food retailer and financial company, plans to offer
legal services through its 300 bank branches, to take advantage
of deregulation that takes effect in October this year under the
Legal Services Act, the Financial Times reported, citing Eddie Ryan, the managing director of the Co-op’s legal unit.  The unit’s staff has been increased from three to 370 since
2006, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
