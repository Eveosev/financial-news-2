President  Eric Rosengren  said that recent economic growth will
not do much to lower the  unemployment rate .  “While GDP, the growth in the economy, has been positive,
it hasn’t been positive enough to make much of a dent on the
unemployment rate,” Rosengren said today in a panel discussion
hosted by the Boston Globe.  “If we only get growth around 3 percent that doesn’t bring
the unemployment rate down very quickly,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
