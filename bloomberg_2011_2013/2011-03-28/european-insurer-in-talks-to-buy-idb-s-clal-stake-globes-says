IDB Holding Corp. is in talks to
sell its stake in  Clal Insurance Enterprise Holdings Ltd. (CLIS)  to a
European insurance company, the Globes reported.  The price could reach $2.1 billion compared with a $1.9
billion company value being negotiated with Permira Funds LLC,
the financial newspaper reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  A representative for IDB told Bloomberg today a number of
parties have shown interest in Clal.  IDB said Jan. 27 it was in talks to sell Clal to Permira, a
private-equity fund.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
