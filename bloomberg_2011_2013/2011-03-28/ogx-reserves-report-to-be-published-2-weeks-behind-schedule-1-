OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes
SA, the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , said
oil auditing firm DeGoyler & MacNaughton will complete a
reserves report two weeks later than expected.  OGX originally said it would publish the report by the end
of March, Investor Relations Director Marcelo Torres said today
on a conference call. The report will include discoveries OGX
made through the end of 2010, Chief Executive Officer Paulo Mendonca said on the same conference call.  OGX added 0.2 percent to 19.89 reais at 10:59 a.m. New York
time. The shares earlier fell as much as 2.7 percent after OGX
announced the report’s delay.  “Some people may be a little concerned about the
results,” Luiz Augosto Pacheco, an analyst at Omar Camargo
Corretora in Curitiba,  Brazil , said in a telephone interview.
“It was supposed to come out at the end of the month.”  OGX’s first crude output at its Waimea field is due in the
third quarter. The company expects to declare Waimea commercial
before the end of the year, Investor Relations Director Marcelo
Torres said today on the call.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
