The Treasury Department’s $35
billion sale of two-year notes may draw a yield of 0.776
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 7 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in March 2013, yielded 0.780
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time. The size of the offering is the same as at the past five
sales of the maturity after peaking at $44 billion in auctions
from October 2009 through April 2010.  Last month’s two-year note auction drew a yield of 0.745
percent, the highest since the May offering yielded 0.769
percent. The record low yield of 0.40 percent was reached at the
October sale.  The Feb. 22 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.03, versus an average of 3.40 for the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 31.3 percent of the notes at the
February offering, compared with an average of 33.8 percent for
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 6.8 percent of
the notes at the last offering, the lowest level since November
2009, compared with the 10-auction average of 14.5 percent.  Two-year notes returned 2.3 percent last year, compared
with a drop so far this year of 0.1 percent, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The overall Treasury market
gained 5.9 percent last year and has lost 0.1 percent this year.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  Today’s offering is the first of three sales of U.S. notes
this week totaling $99 billion. The Treasury will sell $35
billion of five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year
securities on March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
