The  International Monetary Fund 
said  Georgia  needs to help its national economy move from
recovery into “durable growth” while taking measures to
contain the effect of rising commodity prices.  “The short-term priority is to limit the impact of the
recent commodity price shock on the most vulnerable and to
contain inflationary risks,” the IMF said in a statement
released today. The Washington-based lender said it welcomes
“the recent increase in social spending and the authorities’
willingness to tighten monetary policy further should inflation
pressures persist or credit grow too fast.”  The IMF said it was forecasting Georgia’s economy will grow
5.5 percent this year, after an estimated 6.3 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
