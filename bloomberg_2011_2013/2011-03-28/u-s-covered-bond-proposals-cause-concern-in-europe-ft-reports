Proposals for covered bonds that
are contained in a bill before the U.S. House of Representatives
risk destroying the securities’ reputation for total safety,
according to Jens Tolckmitt, the chief executive officer of the
Association of German Pfandbrief Banks.  The bonds, currently selling in large quantities, have
their origins in 18th-century Prussia and are backed by pools of
loans that stay on banks’ books; they’re seen as ultra-secure
because banks must replace bad loans and the pool is ring-fenced
for bondholders in the event of bankruptcy, the newspaper said.  The bill before the U.S. House allows for bonds to be
backed by a much wider range of assets than is usual in  Europe ,
where as much as 80 percent are backed by high-quality
mortgages, the FT said.  European covered bonds are bought by a “stable investor
base” that likes “boring” products, and if a different type
of product is created that appeals to hedge funds, “those
investors may not be there in a crisis,” Tolckmitt told the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
