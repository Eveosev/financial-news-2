Investors in  Iberdrola SA (IBE) â€™s
Renovables division, including  Blackrock Inc. (BLK)  and Generation
Investment Management LLP, have written to the Spanish utility
provider to protest against its plan to buy back the 20 percent
of shares held by outside investors at almost half the price
they were listed for, the Financial Times reported, citing
Generation Senior Partner David Blood.  The company has offered 3.08 euros ($4.33) in Iberdrola
shares in exchange for each Renovables share, which were
originally priced at 5.30 euros a share when it was listed in
2007, the FT said.  Iberdrola said the offer had been judged as fair to
minority shareholders by independent directors and banking
advisers, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
