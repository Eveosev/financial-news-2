The People’s Bank of China plans to
sell the most one-year bills in 12 months at an auction tomorrow,
seeking to drain cash from the financial system.  The central bank will sell 99 billion yuan ($15.1 billion)
of the securities, according to a statement on its website today.
That would be the highest amount since March 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It shows the PBOC has stepped up efforts to drain
liquidity using open-market operations,” said Liu Junyu, a bond
analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the country’s
sixth-largest lender by market value. “The authorities are
worried not only about the huge amount of maturing bills but
also the rising capital inflows.”  A total of 132 billion yuan of central bank bills and
 repurchase agreements  will mature this week and another 810
billion yuan may be redeemed in the following four weeks, said
Tang Guohui, a bond analyst at Industrial Securities Co.  The central bank sold 50 billion yuan of one-year bills at
a yield of 3.1992 percent at the last weekly auction of the
notes on March 22. China Merchants’ Liu said he expects the
yield to remain unchanged tomorrow.  -- Judy Chen , Jing Jin. Editors:  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
