Northern Ireland police said a bomb
left outside a courthouse in Derry, in the northwest of the U.K.
region, is “viable and of a substantial size’’ and an operation
is under way to defuse it.  The device, which is inside a vehicle, was left at the court
yesterday; several controlled explosions have been carried out,
a police spokesman said in a telephone interview. The spokesman
declined to be identified, in line with police regulations in
the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
