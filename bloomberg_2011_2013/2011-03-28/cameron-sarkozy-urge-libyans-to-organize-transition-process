Muammar Qaddafi’s regime has
“completely lost its legitimacy” and Libyans should start
organizing a transition process in anticipation of a new
government coming to power, said U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy .  Qaddafi “must go immediately,” the two leaders said today
in a joint letter before the U.K. hosts the London Conference on
 Libya . “We call all of his followers to leave him before it is
too late. We call on all Libyans who believe Qaddafi is leading
Libya into a disaster to take the initiative now to organize a
transition process.”  The conference tomorrow, which brings in 40 foreign
ministers and representatives from key regional groups, aims to
bring the international community together “to support Libya’s
transition from violent dictatorship and to help create the
conditions where the people of Libya can choose their own
future,” according to a  statement  by the U.K. Foreign and
Commonwealth Office.  Cameron and Sarkozy said this could include the Interim
National Transitional Council and civil society leaders who they
suggested begin a “national political dialogue, leading to a
representative process of transition, constitutional reform and
preparation for free and fair elections.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
