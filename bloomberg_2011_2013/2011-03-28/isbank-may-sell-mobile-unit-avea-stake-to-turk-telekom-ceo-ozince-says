Ersin Ozince, chief executive of
 Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR)  AS, said the banking group may sell a stake
in Turkish mobile phone operator Avea to  Turk Telekomunikasyon
AS (TTKOM)  should it offer “the right price.”  Isbank group hasn’t started any talks with Turk Telekom on
the possible sale, Ozince said in an interview at a conference
in Istanbul today. Isbank group, which includes Isbank, owns 19
percent of Avea. Turk Telekom is the majority shareholder.  “We haven’t had talks with them,” he said. “We may
consider selling if they offer the right price.”  Isbank reversed earlier losses, rising as much as 1.6
percent to 5.03 liras on the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  after
Ozince spoke. The share climbed 2 kurus, or 0.4 percent, to 4.97
liras at 12:30 p.m., when the first trading session closed.  Turk Telekom hasn’t made an offer for the Avea shares that
Isbank owns and Isbank isn’t evaluating any offer, Ozince told
reporters later, according to Anatolia news agency.  Avea is  Turkey ’s third-biggest mobile phone operator after
Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS and Vodafone Group Plc’s unit in
the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
