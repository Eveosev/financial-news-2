Cyprus’s planned financial fund to
support banks in an emergency should have 500 million euros
($704 million) in capital, Central Bank of Cyprus governor
Athanasios Orphanides said.  Cyprus plans to raise 60 million euros in 2011 and 2012
each from a tax on institutions with local banking activities.
Of the total amount raised, 50 million euros will be allocated
to the fund and 70 million euros to the state, government
spokesman Stefanos Stefanou said on Jan. 20.  “The fund should correspond to 3 percent of gross domestic
product,” Orphanides told reporters in Nicosia today. “We
should create in the long run a fund that stands in relation to
the size of our financial system”.  The extraordinary levy of 0.095 percent on  bank deposits 
for 2011 and 2012 won’t exceed 20 percent of a bank’s profit for
both years. The central bank will decide after 2012 how much
banks should contribute to the fund, Finance Minister Charilaos Stavrakis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
