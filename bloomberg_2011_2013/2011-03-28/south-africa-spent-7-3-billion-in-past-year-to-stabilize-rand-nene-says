South Africa  spent 50 billion rand
in the past year to help stabilize the currency, Deputy Finance
Minister Nhlanhla Nene said.  The rand is “vulnerable” because the high volume of
trades makes the currency volatile, Nene said at a conference
hosted by the Economist magazine in Johannesburg today.  Nene added that energy rationing may be inevitable because
of a shortage of power supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
