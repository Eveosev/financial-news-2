Libyan rebels advanced west toward
Muammar Qaddafi’s hometown of Sirte, recapturing Ajdabiya, Brega
and the strategic oil port of Ras Lanuf, after U.S. and allied
warplanes bombarded loyalist tanks, artillery and soldiers.  Egypt’s benchmark index climbing the most in more than 15
month as investors said the country’s shares were cheap after
last week’s 12 percent plunge and the nation’s political climate
seemed more stable.  Dubai’s benchmark index rallied to a one-month high after
 Saudi Arabia  ordered the creation of a housing ministry and on
speculation Egyptian equities may get a boost from a government
pledge to provide funds for shares investment.  Ten Syrians including security personnel and two gunmen
were killed in the coastal city of Latakia over the past two
days as President Bashar Al-Assad’s promises of freedoms and pay
increases failed to prevent dissent from spreading.  Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said his nation faces
growing chaos and a civil war that may split the country.
“Yemen is a time bomb,” Saleh said in an interview with Al
Arabiya television, according to a transcript published by the
state-run Saba news agency. Bahrain’s largest Shiite opposition
bloc, al-Wefaq, said it welcomed a Kuwaiti initiative to mediate
between the Bahraini government and its opponents.  WHAT TO WATCH:
