Treasuries fell, pushing yields to
a two-week high, as the U.S. prepared three note auctions this
week, starting with a $35 billion two-year sale today.  Government securities  headed for a first-quarter loss as
signs of economic growth ate into demand for the safety of debt.
A report today will say  consumer spending  increased in February,
while figures April 1 will show employment picked up in March,
Bloomberg News surveys of economists show.  “The positive momentum is continuing,” said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.,
a unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-
largest publicly traded bank by assets. “Commodities and
stocks will do much better than corporate bonds or
Treasuries.”  Ten-year yields rose two basis points to 3.46 percent as
of 9:20 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The price of the 3.625 percent note maturing in
February 2021 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to
101 11/32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
