Russian stocks snapped a three-day
winning streak as oil, the country’s main export revenue earner,
dropped on speculation that territorial gains by Libyan rebels
may quicken a resolution to its civil war.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slid 0.2 percent to 1,802.21 by 2:40 p.m.
in Moscow, erasing an earlier gain of as much as 0.2 percent.
OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest oil producer, dropped 1.2
percent. OAO Sberbank, the country’s biggest lender, fell 0.9
percent. OAO Polyus Gold, the nation’s largest gold producer,
lost 0.7 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index fell 0.6
percent to 2,029.41.  Crude for May delivery slipped as much as 86 cents to
$104.54 a barrel in  New York  amid speculation  Japan ’s nuclear
crisis will delay rebuilding efforts and on concern over
European nations debt. It was at $104.97 at 11:43 a.m. in
 London . The contract was down for a third day, the longest
decline since a four-day drop through March 11.  Protests across the Middle East and North Africa that
ousted leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia  have spread to  Syria  and
sparked a war in  Libya . Libyan rebel forces advanced westward
with support from NATO air strikes targeting Sirte, the hometown
of Muammar Qaddafi.  “ Oil prices  are high and the market has had a good run but
investors are unwilling to commit more funds,” Tom Mundy, chief
strategist at Otkritie Financial Corp. in Moscow, said by phone.
“We could see a pullback.”  The Micex has gained 6.9 percent this year compared with a
1.1 percent loss for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
