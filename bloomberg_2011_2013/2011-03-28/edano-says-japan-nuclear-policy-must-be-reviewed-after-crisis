Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Yukio Edano said the government will review its nuclear power
policy once the situation at the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi
atomic plant is under control.  “Once this is resolved, we need to carry out a thorough
review and examination of this major policy decision,” Edano
told reporters today in Tokyo.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s government in June released a
 “Strategic Energy Plan”  that called for building nine new
nuclear  power plants  by 2020 and more than 14 by 2030. Under the
proposal, Tokyo Electric Power Co. would build two more reactors
at the Dai-Ichi plant damaged by the record March 11 earthquake
and tsunami that has killed more than 10,000 people.  Rising  radiation emissions  may be the result of a partial
meltdown of nuclear fuel at reactor No. 2’s containment vessel,
Edano said earlier today. The radiation and water leaking from
the reactor are hampering efforts to cool the plant, site of the
worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl 25 years ago.  Asked about plans to construct reactors No. 7 and No. 8 at
the plant, Edano said “nuclear policy as a whole” must be
reviewed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
