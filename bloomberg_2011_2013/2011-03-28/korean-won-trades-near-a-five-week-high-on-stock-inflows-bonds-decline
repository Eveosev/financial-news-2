South Korea ’s won traded near a
five-week high as overseas investors added to their holdings of
the nation’s shares for an eighth day, the longest run of net
purchases since October.  The currency strengthened 1.1 percent last week as
foreigners pumped $896 million into the local stock market, the
biggest inflows since Jan. 7. Demand for emerging-market assets
was supported by a U.S. government report on March 25 that
showed the world’s largest economy expanded at a faster pace
than initially estimated during the fourth quarter of 2010. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares had its best weekly
advance since Feb. 4.  “Market players are closely looking at the stock markets
in and outside  Korea ,” said Ko Yun Jin, a currency trader at
Kookmin Bank in Seoul. “Still, there are expectations the won
isn’t likely to rise too much further beyond 1,110.”  The won traded at 1,114.40 per dollar as of the 3 p.m.
close in Seoul, little changed from 1,114.20 at the end of last
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Kospi index
of shares rose 0.1 percent to close at its highest level since
Feb. 8.  The  S&P 500  rose 2.7 percent last week. The  U.S. economy 
grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, faster
than the 2.8 percent estimate issued last month, figures from
the Commerce Department showed.  South Korea’s benchmark three-year government bonds
declined, pushing the yield on the 3 percent note due December
2013 one basis point higher to a two-week high of 3.74 percent,
according to prices from the Korea Stock Exchange. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
