Krishnamurthy Harihar, Mumbai-based
treasurer at FirstRand Ltd., comments on the outlook for  India ’s
rupee.  The rupee declined 0.2 percent to 44.78225 as of 9:34 a.m.
in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The rupee will strengthen to 44.50 in the next week. We
have seen the currency gaining in the past few days mainly on
local issues. It is not necessarily dollar weakness, it is more
of a sense that the worst seems to be over.  “Overall the inflation numbers are steady and the stock
market seems to be attracting enough buying. A little bit of
risk appetite is coming back.  The currency was likely to weaken in a month’s time,
Harihar said. “But that can change if the trade deficit really
comes down.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
