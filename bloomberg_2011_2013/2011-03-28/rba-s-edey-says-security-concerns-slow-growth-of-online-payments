Australian consumers’ concerns
about security are slowing the expansion of transactions over
the Internet, central bank official Malcolm Edey said in a
speech today outlining a review of the payments industry.  “By far the biggest factor preventing people from making
more use of online bill payments is the risk of fraud,”  Reserve
Bank  of  Australia  Assistant Governor Edey said in prepared
remarks in Sydney. “Around half of respondents identified risk
of fraud as a factor discouraging greater use” for online
purchases, he said.  The central bank, through its Payments System Board, has a
mandate to promote payments system efficiency, said Edey, who
didn’t address monetary policy or the nation’s economy in the
text of the speech.  “The bank has taken the view that, where price signals are
distorted for some reason, there is a case for using its
regulatory powers to correct them,” he said in the speech text.  He said consumers are mostly satisfied with payments
services in Australia, according to the survey, which is due to
be released later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
