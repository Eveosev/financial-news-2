Exelon Corp. (EXC)  shut its 1,134-
megawatt Limerick 2 reactor in  Pennsylvania  to replace fuel and
perform maintenance, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  The plantâ€™s three main power transformers and about a third
of its fuel will be replaced during the outage, according to the
statement.  Limerick 1, another unit at the site, about 21 miles (34
kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia, is operating at 92
percent of capacity, according to a report from the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
