Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive
Officer Bob Diamond,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  CEO Stuart Gulliver and
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  CEO Peter Sands plan to write to the
government’s Independent Commission on Banking to express
concern about proposed stringent bank capital rules, Sky News
City Editor Mark Kleinman  reported , without attribution.  The rules proposed in a January report co-written by Bank
of England Monetary Policy Committee member David Miles suggest
U.K. banks should hold double the amount of capital required
under new proposals by the Basel Committee on Supervision,
Kleinman said. The bank chiefs will argue in their letter that
the implementation of such rules would have “severely
damaging” consequences for the U.K. and global economies,
Kleinman reported, without saying where he got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
