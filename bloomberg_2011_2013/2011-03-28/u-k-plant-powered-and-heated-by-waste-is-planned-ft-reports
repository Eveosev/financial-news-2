DS Smith Plc (SMDS) , a U.K. packaging
company, U.S. waste company Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. and
German utility  E.ON AG (EOAN)  are planning a factory in Britain that
would be powered and heated by commercial, municipal and
household waste, the Financial Times reported.  The 350 million-pound ($560 million) packaging plant, which
would be one of the first of its kind in the U.K., would also
generate electricity for the grid, the newspaper said; it added
that planning consent is needed before the project can proceed.  E.ON has such plants operating in Germany and Poland, but
none so far in the U.K., which lags behind the rest of Europe in
recycling waste; local authorities dumped 12.5 million metric
tons of waste in landfill sites in 2009-10, out of a total of
26.5 million tons, the FT said, citing the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
