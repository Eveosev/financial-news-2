Hungary’s forint ended a seven-day
rally, sliding from its strongest level in 11 months against the
euro, after the central bank left borrowing costs unchanged.  The forint weakened 0.3 percent to 267.34 per euro by 5:45
p.m. in Budapest, paring its March appreciation to 1.3 percent.  Hungarian policy makers voted unanimously to keep the main
interest rate unchanged for a second month, after the country
took three quarter-point increases between November and January
to tackle inflation. The monetary-policy council may keep the
existing conditions for an “extended period,”  Andras Simor ,
chief of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank, said after the rate decision.  “There is nothing from the central bank today to change
our view that interest rates are on hold for several months,”
 Nigel Rendell , an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in London,
wrote in a report to clients today. “Should the economic
recovery falter there is still the risk that the four new MPC
members could outvote the other three on the council and push
rates lower.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
