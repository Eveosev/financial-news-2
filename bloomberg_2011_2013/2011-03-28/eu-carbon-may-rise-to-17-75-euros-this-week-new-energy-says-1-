European Union carbon may rise to
17.75 euros ($24.93) a metric ton this week because a “green
revolution” in yesterday’s German state elections probably will
curb nuclear power, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  “The election result in Baden-Wuerttemberg is clearly
bullish for EU allowances and German power, as there is a much
stronger likelihood that the life extensions to German nuclear
power stations will be more limited than previously expected,”
New Energy Finance analysts including Matthew Cowie in  London 
said today in an e-mailed research note.  Carbon for December rose 1.5 percent to 17.11 euros a ton
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London as of 12:05 p.m.
Profits achieved by German utilities selling power generated
from coal in 2012 was little changed today at 4.76 euros a
megawatt hour, based on so-called dark-spreads calculated by
Bloomberg data. They have jumped from 2.04 euros on March 10,
the day before an earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  prompted
radiation leaks from a reactor at the Fukushima plant.  The release of 2010 verified emissions data from emitters
in the EU cap-and-trade program may have a neutral-to-bullish
impact on carbon prices this week, according to the New Energy
Finance report. Prices rose on each of the data-release days for
2009, 2008 and 2007, the analysts said. The EU is slated to
release data for 2010 on April 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
