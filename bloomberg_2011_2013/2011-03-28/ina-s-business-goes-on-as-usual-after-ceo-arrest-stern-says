Business at  INA  Industrija Nafte
d.d., the Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt, is
“unaffected” by arrest of the chief executive officer, said
Davor Stern, head of INA’s supervisory board.  “Business is going on as usual,” Stern said today in a
phone interview.  INA’s CEO, Bojan Milkovic, was arrested March 25 on
corruption charges. An investigative judge has ordered Milkovic
to be held for 30 days as an investigation continues. Milkovic
became the chief of INA in June 2009. Previously he was the head
of INA’s drilling unit  Crosco d.d.   Stern said there will not be an interim replacement for
Milkovic. He reiterated a statement from March 25 that the
investigation is not related to Milkovic’s current position, but
to the job he held at Crosco.  Croatia ’s  market regulator  today suspended trade in INA
Industrija Nafte d.d. stock until April 1. It acted “following
significant trading by foreign investors,” and to protect INA’s
shareholders, the watchdog said in a statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
