The following is a roundup of
soccer stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the
Web.  Barcelona Balks  Barcelona President  Sandro Rosell  said the club won’t pay
Arsenal 50 million euros ($70.4 million) for Cesc Fabregas, the
 Daily Telegraph  reported.  “If we offered Arsenal 40 million euros for Cesc last
summer, 50 million is now impossible,” Rosell was quoted as
saying. “If the coach demands Cesc we will negotiate with the
Gunners but at a correct limit and without madness.”  Van Nistelrooy Talks  Blackburn is in talks with Ruud van Nistelrooy’s advisers
about signing the striker from Hamburg on a free transfer, the
 Daily Mirror  reported.  The 34-year-old may accept a “lucrative” offer from the
Premier League club if it avoids relegation, the Mirror said.  Mourinho’s Money  Jose Mourinho  would demand a 20 million pound ($32 million)
salary, double his Real  Madrid  income, to coach a Premier League
team, the  Daily Express  reported.  Two teams in the top half of the standings were told of the
requirement when they sounded out his availability, the Express
said, without identifying them.  Capello’s Reserves  England coach Fabio Capello “has risked the wrath” of
fans by saying he plans to send out a team of reserves in an
exhibition against  Ghana  in two days, the  Daily Mail  reported.  Manchester City’s Gareth Barry could captain the national
team for the game at Wembley, according to  the Independent .  To contact the reporter on this story:
