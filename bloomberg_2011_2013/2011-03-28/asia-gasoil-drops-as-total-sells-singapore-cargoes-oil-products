Asia gasoil fell as Total SA sold
two cargoes in  Singapore , the region’s biggest oil-trading
center. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha declined for a second day.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur, dropped 65
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $131.35 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Jet fuel fell $1.05, or 0.8 percent, to
$132.50. Each product declined for the third day.  Total,  Europe ’s largest refiner, sold 170,000 barrels of
gasoil with 10 parts-per-million of sulfur to BP Plc at $4.80 a
barrel over quotes, traders said. The company also sold 150,000
barrels to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at plus $4.70. Vitol Group sold
250,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur grade to Cargill Inc. at a
15-cent premium.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude decreased
35 cents to $22.07 a barrel at 6:18 p.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, was at the narrowest since March 11.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil slipped 5 cents to $1.25, PVM
said. This regrade narrowed for the first time in five days,
meaning it’s less profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  fell 0.9
percent to $986.50 a metric ton, according to Bloomberg data.
The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent traded in
 London , or the crack spread, dropped to $119.41 from $124.15 at
the end of Asian trading on March 25, Bloomberg data showed.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline fell 1 percent to $119.30 a
barrel, based on Bloomberg data. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha
fell 25 cents to $11.35 a barrel. A narrower reforming margin
means the profit from turning naphtha into gasoline is falling.  In Singapore, Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. bought 50,000 barrels
of 92-RON gasoline loading April 12 to April 16 from
ConocoPhillips at $119.40 a barrel, traders said. Arcadia also
bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON grade loading April 17 to April
21 from Glencore International AG at $119.30.  Shell sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for second-half May
delivery to Cargill at $988 a ton, traders said.  India ’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp. canceled an offer to sell
35,000 tons of naphtha for April loading because of
“unavoidable circumstances,” the company said in an e-mail,
without providing details.  Fuel Oil   Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil dropped $5.45, or 0.8
percent, to $649.75 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The
price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel,
was down $3.50, or 0.6 percent, at $636. Each variety ended a
three-day advance.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 30 cents to
$8.16 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. The premium of 180-
centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade, or the viscosity
spread, was down $1.95 at $13.75 a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
