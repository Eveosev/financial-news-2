Cocoa may advance in  London  on
speculation extended unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world’s
largest cocoa producer, heightens the risk of a bean shortage
next season. Coffee and sugar declined.  Thousands of supporters rallied in Abidjan over the weekend
in support of incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo , who has
ordered cocoa exporters to ship beans or face sanctions. Rival
 Alassane Ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of Nov.
28 presidential elections, has imposed an export ban. Cocoa
supplies will exceed demand this season, according to the
International Cocoa Organization.  “The market is concerned that we may tip into a deficit if
a potential war affects the next main crop,” said Keith Flury,
an analyst at Rabobank International in London. The  Ivory
Coast ’s main crop usually starts in October.  Cocoa for May delivery was little changed at 2,111 pounds
($3,372) a metric ton at 11:52 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
London. Cocoa for May delivery fell $17, or 0.5 percent, to
$3,225 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Ouattara ordered the export ban until March 31. The surplus
for the current season that ends Sept. 30 is estimated at
119,000 tons, after a shortage of 66,000 tons a year earlier,
the ICCO estimated on March 1.  Bigger Crop  The Ivory Coast’s crop is supposed to be 6.7 percent larger
this year, helping to keep the market in surplus, according to
the International Cocoa Organization. The country’s production
will be 1.325 million tons, up from 1.242 million tons last
year, the ICCO said.  Robusta coffee futures for May delivery dropped $16, or 0.7
percent, to $2,426 a ton in London. Robusta coffee may rise to
$3,000 a ton in the next two months because supply from
 Vietnam , the biggest grower, will decline at a time when demand
from roasters is accelerating, according to F.O. Licht analyst
 Stefan Uhlenbrock .  Arabica coffee for May delivery fell 3.05 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.6555 a pound in New York.  White, or refined, sugar futures for May delivery dropped
$1.40, or 0.2 percent, to $710.40 a ton in London. Raw-sugar
futures for May delivery declined 0.07 cent, or 0.3 percent, to
27.79 cents a pound on ICE.  Indonesia  has secured about 65,000
tons of white sugar imports for the first quarter, or about 14
percent of the 450,000-ton import quota allowed for household
consumption, F.O. Licht said in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
