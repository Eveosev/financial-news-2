U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague  told the BBC in an interview that the U.K and its allies
are “staying absolutely” within a “rigid application” of the
United Nations resolution on  Libya . The bombing of military
facilities forms part of protecting the civilian population of
Libya, Hague said.  There will be no allied occupation of Libya, Hague also
said. “The people of Libya must choose their government,”
Hague told the BBC. The allies are in “very close touch” with
opposition leaders in the country and Hague said he also
continues to “speak directly” to the Libyan foreign minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
