Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) , a
U.K. fund manager, said new business flows rose 19 percent in
the first five months of its fiscal year as clients invested in
equity and emerging-market funds.  Gross new business for the five months to Feb. 28 climbed
to 19.1 billion pounds ($30.6 billion) from 16.1 billion pounds
a year earlier, Aberdeen said in a statement today. The firm had
176.2 billion pounds of assets under management on Feb. 28.  “While market conditions have been difficult since the
beginning of the year, it is encouraging to see net inflows in
the first two months,” Chief Executive Officer Martin Gilbert
said in the statement. “The outlook for organic growth of
assets under management remains favorable.”  New business inflows for the two months to Feb. 28 totaled
6.9 billion pounds, Aberdeen said.  The company is due to report its interim results on May 3.
