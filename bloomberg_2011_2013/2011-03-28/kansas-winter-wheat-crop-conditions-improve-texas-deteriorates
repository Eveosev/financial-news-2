Winter-wheat conditions in  Kansas 
improved last week as warm weather helped crops emerge from
dormancy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. Crops in
 Texas  deteriorated.  About 31 percent of the crop in  Kansas , the biggest U.S.
winter-wheat grower, was in good or excellent condition as of
yesterday, up from 27 percent a week  earlier , the USDAâ€™s
National Agricultural Statistics Service said today in a report
on its website.  In  Texas , 11 percent got the top ratings, down from 14
percent a week  earlier .  To contact the reporter on this story:
