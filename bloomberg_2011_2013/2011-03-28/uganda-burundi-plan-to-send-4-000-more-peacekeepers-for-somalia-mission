Uganda and Burundi will send 4,000
additional soldiers to Somalia to boost the African Union’s
peacekeeping mission.  Each country will provide 2,000 troops, with deployment in
Somalia expected by the middle of this year, Barigye Ba-Hoku,
spokesman for the mission, known as Amisom, said in an e-mailed
statement on March 26.  Uganda and Burundi already have more than 6,200 soldiers
deployed in Somalia to support the Western-backed Transitional
Federal Government, which is fighting rebels backed by al-Qaeda,
according to the Amisom’s website. Somalia hasn’t had a
functioning government since the ouster of Mohamed Siad Barre,
the former dictator, in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
