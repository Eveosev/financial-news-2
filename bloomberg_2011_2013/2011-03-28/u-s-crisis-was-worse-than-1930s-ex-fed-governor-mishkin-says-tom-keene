The U.S. financial crisis that
started in 2007 was “worse and more complicated than the one
that caused the Great Depression,” former Federal Reserve
Governor Frederic S. Mishkin said today.  While the economy skirted another depression, “we still
have some serious problems,” such as credit availability for
small businesses, Mishkin said on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .  Mishkin, who served on the Fed Board from September 2006 to
August 2008, and as research director at the Fed Bank of New
York, is a professor of economics at Columbia University in New
York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
