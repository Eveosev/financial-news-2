Poland ’s WIG20 Index gained 14.53,
or 0.5 percent, to 2,828.42 in Warsaw, closing at the highest
level since June 2008.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the largest Czech power utility, advanced
for a second day in Warsaw trading, climbing 2.4 zloty, or 1.7
percent, to 144.4 zloty. Bank of America Merrill Lynch
recommended buying the stock, saying a further rally in
electricity prices will boost earnings.  Bank Handlowy SA (BHW PW) rose for a fourth day, adding 3.2
zloty, or 3.4 percent, to 98.3 zloty. The Citigroup Inc. unit
may join Warsaw’s WIG20 Index, replacing  Bank Zachodni WBK SA (BZW) ,
Parkiet reported on March 26, without citing anyone. Zachodni
