Soybeans fell for the first time in
three sessions on reports that rains caused less damage than
expected to crops in  Brazil , the world’s biggest exporter after
the U.S.  Brazil will produce a record 71.5 million metric tons this
year, researcher Safras & Mercados said on March 25. That’s
higher than the 70 million forecast by the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  earlier this month. Farmers have sold 58 percent of
their crop as of March 25, crop-consulting firm Celeres said
today.  “It looks like the rains in Brazil have not damaged the
crop as much as people were expecting,” said Greg Grow, the
director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago. “Demand for U.S. soybeans should slow.”  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 9.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to close at $13.485 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade, after rising 0.5 percent the prior two
sessions.  Earlier, the price touched to $13.69, the highest since
March 23, on speculation a USDA report will show farmers intend
to plant less acreage with the oilseed. The agency’s report is
scheduled for March 31.  Soybeans, valued at $38.9 billion in 2010, are the biggest
U.S. crop after corn, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
