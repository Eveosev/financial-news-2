Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  released
hydrofluoric acid and hydrocarbons at its  Texas  City refinery in
Texas and yesterday, according to a filing with the National
Response Center.  A release of isobutene, butane, propane and hydrofluoric
acid from a depropanizer tower was reported in a  filing  made
with the center yesterday. The incident occurred at 4 p.m. local
time, according to the report.  “The source of the small release at Marathon’s Texas City
refinery has been located and our crews have isolated it,”
Shane Pochard, a company spokesman who is based in Findlay,
 Ohio , said in an e-mail today. Pochard declined to specify the
source and reason for the release.  A shelter-in-place warning was issued by the  Texas City ’s
emergency management office yesterday. The advisory was lifted
at 6 p.m. after the city didn’t detect any hydrofluoric acid in
the air.  U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund.  Marathon’s Texas City refinery has a capacity of 81,500
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
