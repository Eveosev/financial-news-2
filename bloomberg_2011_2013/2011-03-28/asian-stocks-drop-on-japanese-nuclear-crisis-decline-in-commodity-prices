Asian stocks fell, dragging down
the benchmark regional index for the first time in three days,
as radiation hampered efforts to cool crippled nuclear reactors
in Japan, and as company earnings missed analyst estimates.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of the nuclear
plant, tumbled 18 percent to its lowest since 1977.  Acer Inc. (2353) ,
the world’s second-largest computer maker, fell 6.9 percent in
Taipei after saying first-quarter sales may miss expectations.
 China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the nation’s No. 2 lender by
market value, and  China  Petroleum & Chemical Corp. slid at least
than 2 percent after earnings fell short of analyst forecasts.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index dropped 0.5 percent to 133.59
as of 7:25 p.m. in Tokyo, with about five stocks declining for
every four that advanced. The gauge had its biggest weekly gain
since November last week as Japan moved to stabilize reactors
damaged by a March 11 earthquake and as companies from Cnooc
Ltd. to Bank of China Ltd.’s earnings surpassed estimates.  “Investors are concerned about production halts and
electricity shortages in Japan, and it will probably take a few
months to restore capacities,” said Hong Kong-based Yoji Takeda, who helps manage $1.1 billion at RBC Investment
Management (Asia) Ltd. “The recent market decline has provided
investors a good buying opportunity, but uncertainties will
prevail in the short-term.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average declined 0.6 percent, and
 Taiwan ’s Taiex Index slid 0.7 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index fell 0.4 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.2
percent. China’s  Shanghai  Composite Index increased 0.2 percent.
 South Korea ’s Kospi Index gained 0.1 percent.  U.S. Economic Growth  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index rose 0.3 percent in  New York  on March
25 after the pace of economic growth was revised higher and
Oracle Corp.’s profit forecast beat analyst estimates.  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter, led by a jump in  consumer spending  that will be
hard to match early in the year as energy prices surge. The
growth numbers compare with a 2.8 percent estimate issued last
month, figures from the Commerce Department showed on March 25
in  Washington .  As the worst atomic accident since Chernobyl entered its
third week, the Japanese government said soil near the Fukushima
plant would be tested for plutonium contamination. The
radioactive metal was used in one of the reactors and its
presence outside the plant would suggest fuel rod damage.  ‘Problems Got Worse’  “The problems at the nuclear plant got worse over the
weekend as more radioactive materials were detected,” said
Kazuhiro Takahashi, a general manager at Tokyo-based Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets Co.  Tokyo  Electric tumbled 18 percent to 696 yen, its lowest
close since February 1977. The crisis at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant has wiped off $29 billion in the company’s market
value, spurring calls for President Masataka Shimizu to quit.  Losses from Japan’s record earthquake and ensuing tsunami
may total $200 billion to $300 billion, California-based Risk
Management Solutions Inc., which advises insurers, said last
week. Companies from Sony Corp. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. have
shut factories since the earthquake.  Sony, which partially closed five domestic plants until
March 31, fell 1.3 percent to 2,600 yen. Tokyo Electron, which
shut a factory in earthquake-struck Iwate prefecture, dropped
3.4 percent to 4,425 yen.  Japan  Tobacco Inc., the world’s third-largest publicly
traded cigarette maker, lost 0.6 percent to 312,000 yen. The
company said it will halt shipments between March 30 and April
10 because of damage to factories.  Acer, Asustek  In Taipei, Asustek Computer Inc., the maker of low-cost
computers, slumped 5.7 percent to NT$239 in Taipei after its
chairman, Jonney Shih, said sales to Japan will be affected “a
little bit” after the March 11 earthquake.  Acer plunged 6.9 percent to NT$67.8. First-quarter revenue
from personal computers may fall about 10 percent from the
previous three months, missing expectations, because of
“relatively weaker” demand in Western Europe and the U.S.,
Acer said on March 25.  China Construction Bank decreased 2.3 percent to HK$7.15 in
 Hong Kong . The lender said full-year net income rose 26 percent
to 134.8 billion yuan ($20.6 billion) from a year ago. That fell
short of the 139 billion yuan average of 17 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  China Petroleum & Chemical, Asia’s biggest refiner,
declined 2 percent to HK$7.69. The company, also known as
Sinopec, said net income rose 14 percent to 71.8 billion yuan
from a year earlier. That missed the 72.5 billion-yuan mean
profit forecast of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  First Decline  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.5 percent this year to
March 25, on course for its first quarterly decline since the
period ended June 30. That compares with gains of 4.5 percent by
the  S&P 500  and 0.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500
and 11.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  Among stocks that advanced, China Minsheng Banking Corp.,
the nation’s first non-state lender, rose 2.6 percent to 5.51
yuan in Shanghai after saying full-year net income increased 45
percent to 17.6 billion yuan from a year earlier.  Cosco Corp.  Singapore  Ltd., a China-based shipbuilder,
climbed 2.5 percent to S$2.06 in Singapore after signing an
agreement to build two drilling platforms, valued at $525
million each, for Sevan Drilling Group.  Posco (005490) , South Korea’s biggest steelmaker, advanced 2.8
percent to 516,000 won. The company said it’s considering
raising steel prices because of higher raw-material costs. Korea
Economic Daily reported earlier that Posco may increase steel
prices by as much as 20 percent next month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
