Avusa Ltd. (AVU) , which runs a publishing
venture with  Pearson Plc (PSON)  in  South Africa , said it received an
unsolicited offer for all of its shares from a group represented
by Capitau Holdings Ltd., RMB Ventures and other unidentified
investors.  Avusa will consider the bid, the Johannesburg-based company
said in a statement today. Earlier its shares surged 18 percent
on the city’s stock exchange to 25 rand, their highest level
since September 2008.  The company, which has a market capitalization of 2.6
billion rand ($378 million), publishes Business Day, South
Africa’s main daily business newspaper, the Financial Mail and
runs Summit TV in a venture with Pearson. Separately it
publishes the Sunday Times, South Africa’s biggest Sunday
newspaper, and the Sowetan.  Earlier Business Day and The New Age newspaper reported
that  Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG)  might bid for the about 79 percent
of Avusa that it doesn’t already own, citing people with
knowledge of the talks. Mvelaphanda didn’t answer a call to its
Johannesburg office outside of normal office hours.  Simon Mays-Smith, a spokesman for London-based Pearson,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
