The bonds of  Portugal , Ireland and
Greece will fall versus benchmark German bunds after a European
leaders’ agreement aimed at stamping out the region’s debt
crisis failed to spur buying, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Spanish and Italian bonds will fare better as investors
discriminate between so-called “near peripherals” and “far
peripherals,” JPMorgan analysts including New York-based chief
market strategist  Jan Loeys , wrote in a March 25 report.  EU leaders last week cut the startup capital for the future
euro emergency aid mechanism in 2013 to 16 billion euros ($23
billion), less than the 40 billion euros foreseen in a March 21
accord, after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  demanded smaller
upfront payments.  “The significant EU agreements reached this month have not
been enough to spark investor demand for the most troubled
peripherals,” the analysts said. “Portugal is moving ever
closer to an inevitable bailout, and the prospect of further
major bank recapitalizations still hangs over Ireland.”  Portugal’s 10-year bonds yielded 451 basis points more than
equivalent-maturity German securities as of 10:32 a.m. in
 London . The spread reached 484 basis points on Nov. 11, the most
since at least 1997 when Bloomberg began collecting the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
