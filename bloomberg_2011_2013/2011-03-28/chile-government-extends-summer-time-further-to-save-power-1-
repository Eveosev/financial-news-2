Chile’s government said it will
extend summer time by another month as it seeks ways to save
energy amid a drought that has cut hydroelectricity output.  Chile will roll clocks back an hour May 7 rather than April
3 as previously planned, returning to summer time Aug. 20,
Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter said today in Santiago. The
change is part of a pilot program that will allow the government
to evaluate results for next year, Mining and Energy Minister
 Laurence Golborne  wrote earlier today on his Twitter page.  Chile normally has seven months of winter time and five
months in the summer schedule, Hinzpeter said. The changes will
result in eight months of summer and four of winter, he told
reporters. The government first changed summer time on March 2
when Golborne said clocks would roll back on April 3, three
weeks later than originally scheduled.  “The summer schedule will allow us to save energy,”
Hinzpeter said from the presidential palace. “Chileans consume
less energy, less electricity, in the summer time. Secondly, a
lot of scientific evidence shows a later nightfall results in
less crime.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
