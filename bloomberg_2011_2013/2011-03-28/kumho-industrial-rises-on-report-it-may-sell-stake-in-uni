Kumho Industrial Co., a South
Korean builder, gained to the highest price in a month in  Seoul 
trading after the Korea Economic Daily reported the company may
sell a stake in a resort unit.  Kumho Industrial rose as much as 14 percent and traded at
12,950 won as of 1 p.m. in Seoul, the highest intraday price
since Feb. 28. The stock has fallen 23 percent this year,
compared with a 0.1 percent drop in the Kospi index.  The Seoul-based company may sell a 50 percent stake it owns
in unlisted  Kumho Resort Co. , the Korea Economic Daily said
March 25, citing industry officials it didn’t identify. The sale
will help the builder raise cash to repay debt stemming from a
takeover of Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. in 2006, the
newspaper reported.  Kumho Resort operates five resorts, two golf courses and
four theme parks in  South Korea  and  China , according to the
company’s website.  Kumho Industrial was taken over by  Korea Development Bank 
and other creditors from Kumho Asiana Group last year. The group
is also selling part of its stake in Korea Express Co., the
country’s biggest logistics company, to raise funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
