Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s South African
unit said it will invest 475 million rand ($69 million) in as
many as 10 black-owned software development companies to fulfil
its obligations to the government to uplift the country’s black
majority.  “We will support these companies over a period of seven
years,” Mteto Nyati, the unit’s managing director, said by phone
from Johannesburg yesterday. “Our consultants will work with
them to put together a package and a business plan. We will fund
whatever is relevant for that particular company to meet its own
stated objectives of growth.”  South Africa ’s government has been pushing companies to
sell stakes to black investors and hire and promote more black
staff to address racial imbalances that persist in  Africa ’s
largest economy, 17 years after the end of all-white rule.  Microsoft, which has a global policy of not selling stakes
in its units, was granted permission to implement an alternative
empowerment plan that entailed investing the equivalent of 4
percent of its sales in black-owned enterprises over seven
years.  Microsoft will sign agreements later today with four
software developers that were selected from 683 applicants, the
company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. They are:
Chillisoft, a developer of software used in health care,
manufacturing and other industries; Maxxor, which specializes in
mobile-phone and web-based computer applications; BUI, a
computer-security company; and Home Grown Business Integrations,
which develops electricity management systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
