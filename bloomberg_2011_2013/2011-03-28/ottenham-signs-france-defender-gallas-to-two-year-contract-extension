Tottenham defender  William Gallas 
signed a two-year contract extension that will tie him to the
Premier League club through 2013.  Gallas has made 28 appearances since joining Tottenham on a
one-year deal in August after his contract with Arsenal expired.
The France international, 33, has also captained Spurs in
Premier League and Champions League matches.  Gallas “has impressed at the heart of our defense since
joining the club in the summer,” Spurs said in a statement on
their website.  A two-time Premier League title winner with Chelsea, Gallas
helped Spurs reach this season’s Champions League quarterfinals
with a goal-line clearance during the 0-0 home draw with AC
Milan in the round of 16.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
