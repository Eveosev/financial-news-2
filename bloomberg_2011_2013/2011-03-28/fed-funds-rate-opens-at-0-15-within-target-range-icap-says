Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending rate, opened at 0.15 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent on March 25 after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.19 percent and averaging 0.13 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire Treasury notes due from March
2015 to August 2016 today as part of its plan to purchase $600
billion more in  U.S. debt  through June and reinvest its maturing
mortgage holdings. The Fed expects to reinvest $250 billion to
$300 billion of proceeds from mortgage-backed debt and agency
securities into Treasuries during that time.  The central bank plans to purchase from $5.5 billion to
$7.5 billion of securities today, according to the New York
Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
