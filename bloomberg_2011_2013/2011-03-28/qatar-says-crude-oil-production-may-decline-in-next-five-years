Qatar, the second-smallest oil
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
may suffer declining output in the next five years, according to
a report by the country’s state planning agency.  “It may be expected that oil production will diminish
during this period despite current efforts to prevent this,”
Qatar’s General Secretariat for Development Planning said in
their National Development Strategy 2011 to 2016 released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
