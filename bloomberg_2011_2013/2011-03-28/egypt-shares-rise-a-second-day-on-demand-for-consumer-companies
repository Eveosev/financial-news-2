Egyptian shares rose for a second
day led by food and telecommunications companies on bets
defensive stocks may better weather the political crisis.  The  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  rose 0.8 percent to 5,251.3 at the 1:30
p.m. close in Cairo.  Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) , the
country’s biggest publicly traded builder, rose 2.2 percent.
Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services, the country’s oldest mobile
network operator, surged 9.4 percent to 149.81 Egyptian pounds.  “We are continuing to see interest in telecoms and food
stocks because they are relatively shielded from the
instability,” said Mostafa Abdel Aziz, an equity trader at
Cairo-based Beltone Securities Brokerage. “But we should start
to see the volatility cool down and return to a normal sideways
movement very soon as investors start taking profits.”  The EGX 30 gauge has tumbled 26 percent so far this year,
making it the world’s worst performer, following unrest that
ousted former President  Hosni Mubarak . Egyptians voted in favor
of constitutional changes on March 19, paving the way for
parliamentary and presidential elections by year-end.  Orascom Construction gained to 226.29 pounds. The  EGX 100
Index (EGX100)  rose 2.1 percent. Trading was suspended for 30 minutes
earlier after the broader EGX 100 measure rose 5.1 percent,
exceeding a 5 percent daily limit.  Stock exchange officials will meet the Egyptian Financial
Supervisory Authority, the market regulator, today to discuss
lifting trading restrictions, including the limit on daily share
moves, bourse chief Mohamed Abdel Salam said by telephone
yesterday.  Egypt ’s bourse was closed for almost two months and
trading resumed on March 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
