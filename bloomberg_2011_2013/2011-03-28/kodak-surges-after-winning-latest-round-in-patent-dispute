Eastman Kodak Co. (EK)  climbed more than
5 percent in New York trading after winning the latest round in
its patent dispute with  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM)   The U.S. International Trade Commission said March 25 after
markets closed that it will review a judge’s findings from
January that Apple’s iPhone and RIM’s BlackBerry don’t violate
Kodak’s patent on a way to preview digital images using less
processing power and storage space.  A victory may allow Kodak to extract $1 billion from Apple
and RIM should it win the case, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Perez said in an interview last week. The review
increases the odds of reaching a settlement, Ananda Baruah, an
analyst at New York-based Brean Murray Carret & Co., said today
in a note to clients. Baruah recommends holding Kodak shares.  Kodak gained 18 cents to $3.58 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had dropped 37
percent this year before today.  Apple and RIM denied infringing the patent and argued it
was invalid. ITC Judge Paul Luckern on Jan. 24 agreed with the
companies on both issues. Kodak challenged that finding.  Kodak’s Perez said he’s basing the potential $1 billion
figure on the combined $964 million received from settlements
reached with Samsung Electronics Co. and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) 
over the same patent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
