May Mailbox  “Metals Mogul”
May 2011  I spent 10 years (1993 to 2002) in  Russia  building a company
there. Your reporting was precise, detailed and highly accurate
of the early years in business post-Soviet collapse. Great story
and great reporting.

New York  I am left with genuine admiration for the clarity that you have
brought to the incredibly convoluted and tortuous passage of
this one man, Deripaska, as he’s been left to his own resources
throughout two astounding decades.
Christian Rodan
Geneva, New York  “Professor List’s
Reality Show”
April 2011  You seem sincere in reporting what is in fact antique idiocy.
The unsaid premise of these experiments, and in most
neoclassical economics, is the notion of timeless, universal
“man” that behaves according to rules and laws knowable through
this type of research. Without this, any conclusions that are
drawn are strictly local: They have no broader application.
There is a massive literature that points to the utter
intellectual bankruptcy of these scientistic approaches to the
world.
Robert Urie
Cambridge, Massachusetts  “Gaming the System”
March 2011  As the director of the Community Development Financial
Institutions Fund, with responsibility for oversight of the New
Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program, I believe that the story
provides a misleading portrayal of this valuable program. By
focusing on only a handful of the close to 3,000 NMTC projects
and by using a poverty measure not widely used by government
agencies, the author attempts to argue that the program’s
activities haven’t met its lofty intents, obscuring the merits
and design of a critical public policy program. The public would
have been better served had the author discussed projects in
low-income communities, including the health-care center and
charter school not far from the church you mentioned.

Washington  “How Colonel Sanders Conquered  China ”
March 2011  So, Yum Brands has established 3,200 KFC locations in China with
a goal of 20,000 within the decade. I wonder if David Novak also
plans a cardiac care network and insulin laboratory. It’s sad
that when Americans are battling obesity, our corporations are
exporting unhealthy diets. China sends us bok choy; we send a
bucket of chicken. The ghost of Sinclair Lewis’s George Babbitt
can now extend his boosterism into the arteries of everyone on
the planet.
