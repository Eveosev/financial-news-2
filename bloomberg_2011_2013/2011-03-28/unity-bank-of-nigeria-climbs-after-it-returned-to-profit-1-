Unity Bank Plc (UNITYBNK) , a Nigerian lender
that was asked by the  central bank  in 2009 to recapitalize, rose
to nearly a two-week high after saying it returned to profit
last year.  The stock gained 4 kobo, or 3.5 percent, to 1.18 naira by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the strongest since March 15. That
pared its decline this year to 1.7 percent, compared with a 0.5
percent drop in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index over
the same period.  Net income for the 12 months through December was 12.5
billion naira ($80.4 million) compared with a loss of 16.1
billion naira a year earlier, the Abuja-based lender said in a
statement published today in ThisDay newspaper. Revenue rose to
63.5 billion naira from 46.4 billion naira, it said.  Some Nigerian lenders posted losses or lower profit because
of a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009. The  Central Bank of Nigeria 
fired the chief executives of eight of the countryâ€™s 24 lenders
after 14 of them failed an audit by the regulator. The CBN
bailed out the industry with 620 billion naira, and asked Unity
Bank and  Wema Bank Plc (WEMABANK) , to raise additional capital to meet
minimum requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
