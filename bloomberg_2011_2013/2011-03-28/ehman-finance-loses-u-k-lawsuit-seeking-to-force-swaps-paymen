A  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) 
unit lost a lawsuit seeking to force  ITV Plc (ITV) ’s Carlton
Communications Ltd. to make payments on two interest-rate swap
agreements.  Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. can’t claim 2.7
million pounds ($4.3 million) plus about 550,000 pounds in
interest under the August 2004 agreement with Carlton, Judge
Michael Briggs ruled today. Carlton had said it didn’t have
to pay because the New York-based bank’s 2008 bankruptcy voided
its obligation to do so when the contract matured in March 2009.  The law “is to relieve the non-defaulting party from
payment obligations for as long as the defaulting party is, by
reason of bankruptcy, incapacitated from providing the promised
hedge,” Briggs said in the judgment.  The Lehman unit sued Carlton in June, saying the TV company
should be forced to pay because the part of the agreement that
allows it to stop payments violates bankruptcy law by depriving
an insolvent entity of assets it is owed.  Lehman Brothers filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history in September 2008, listing $613 billion in debt. It had
more than 900,000 derivative contracts outstanding when it
collapsed. Its financing unit filed for creditor protection the
following month in  New York .  Lehman’s press department declined to immediately comment.  The case is Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v.
Carlton Communications Ltd., case no. HC10C02146,  High Court  of
Justice,  Chancery Division  (London).  To contact the reporter for this story:
