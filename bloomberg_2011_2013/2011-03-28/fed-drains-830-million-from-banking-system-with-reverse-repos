The  Federal Reserve  drained $830
million in reserves from the banking system when it arranged
seven-day tri-party reverse repurchase agreements.  The transactions, part of a series of open-market
operations that began in 2009, don’t represent any change in
monetary policy, according to the  Federal Reserve  Bank of New
York’s  website .  Treasuries, agencies and agency mortgage-backed
securities were eligible collateral. Settlement is tomorrow.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties. The central bank added more than $1
trillion in extra cash to its balance sheet as part of its
effort to combat the financial crisis.  In a tri-party arrangement, a third party functions as the
agent for the transaction and holds the security as collateral.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. are the
only banks that serve in a trade-clearing capacity in the tri-
party repo market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
