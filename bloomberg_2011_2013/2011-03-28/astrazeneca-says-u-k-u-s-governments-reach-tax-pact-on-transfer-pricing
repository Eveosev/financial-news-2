AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the second-biggest
U.K. drugmaker, raised its profit target for the year after
agreeing to settle U.S. tax and valuation matters.  AstraZeneca will pay a net $1.1 billion to resolve the
issues. The company had set aside $2.3 billion, and now will
release some of that accrual, AstraZeneca said in a statement
today. That will boost earnings by about $500 million in the
first quarter, London-based AstraZeneca said.  The drugmaker raised its target for core earnings per share
this year to a range of $6.90 to $7.20, up from $6.45 to $6.75,
as a result of the accrual benefit and a projected lower tax
rate throughout the year.  AstraZeneca fell 1.5 pence to 2,872.5 pence in trading in
 London . The shares have declined 1.7 percent this year.  Tax authorities in the U.S. and the U.K. agreed on an
advance pricing agreement regarding transfers between
AstraZenecaâ€™s international subsidiaries for the period from
2002 through 2014, the company said. AstraZeneca also agreed
with U.S. tax authorities on a related valuation matter stemming
from the integration of its U.S. businesses after the merger
that created the company in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
