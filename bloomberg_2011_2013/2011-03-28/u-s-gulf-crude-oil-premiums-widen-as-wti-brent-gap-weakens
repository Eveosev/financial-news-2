Premiums for crude in the U.S.  Gulf
Coast  strengthened against West Texas Intermediate as Brent
oil’s differential to the U.S. benchmark widened.  The gap between May-delivery WTI futures and Brent, its
European counterpart, widened 69 cents to $10.88 a barrel at
1:13 p.m. in  New York . A wider gap between Brent and WTI
strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete
with West African oil priced against Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened $1.50 to
$13.25 a barrel at 12:58 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained $1 to $13.50
over the benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium strengthened 50 cents to
$7.25. Thunder Horse gained $1.40 to $11.50 a barrel over WTI.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount narrowed 30 cents to $3.20 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing.  Mars Blend’s premium narrowed 75 cents to $7.25 a barrel
over WTI. Poseidon’s premium was unchanged at $7.25.  Canadian Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $11 a barrel.
The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 45 cents to
$16.80 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
