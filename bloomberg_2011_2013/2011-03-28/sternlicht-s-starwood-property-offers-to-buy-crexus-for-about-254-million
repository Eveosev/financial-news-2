Starwood Property Trust Inc. (STWD) , the
property investor founded by  Barry Sternlicht , offered to buy
 CreXus Investment Corp. (CXS)  for about $254 million to create the
largest U.S. commercial mortgage real estate investment trust.  Starwood’s bid of about $14 a share is a 20 percent premium
over the price of New York-based CreXus this morning, Starwood
said in a statement. The Greenwich, Connecticut-based company
said it made a formal proposal to the board of CreXus, which is
25 percent owned by  Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NLY)   The acquisition would cut costs, add to Starwood’s earnings
and diversify its assets, the company said. The offer is
contingent on the suspension of a share sale that CreXus is
planning to fund the purchase of a $586 million commercial real
estate loan portfolio from Barclays Plc.  “Our initial impression is that this offer is a good one”
for Starwood, Joshua Barber, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
in Baltimore, wrote in a report today. "However, we seriously
doubt that CXS will sell at $14 per share and hope STWD does not
pursue a bidding war.’’  CreXus is evaluating the offer and hasn’t suspended the
equity offering, it said in a statement today. Jay Diamond, a
spokesman for Annaly, declined to comment. A unit of  New York- 
based Annaly also manages CreXus.  Starwood fell 40 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $22.66 at 2:47
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. CreXus rose
44 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $12.40, after earlier gaining as
much as 13 percent. The Bloomberg REIT Mortgage Index rose 2.4
percent this year through March 25.  Barclays Portfolio  The Barclays portfolio includes commercial mortgages,
subordinate notes and mezzanine debt backed by properties such
as hotels, offices, condominiums, apartments and retail real
estate, CreXus said in a March 21 statement.  “CreXus stockholders would receive stock in a
significantly more liquid entity without facing the substantial
book value dilution of CreXus’s pending equity offering,”
Sternlicht said in his statement today.  Starwood is making loans and buying debt tied to offices,
shopping centers, apartments, warehouses and hotels as U.S.
commercial property prices are 43 percent below their 2007 peak,
according to Moody’s Investors Service.  Sternlicht, in a letter to CreXus’s board, wrote that the
company’s shares have generally traded at a discount to book
value because of its emphasis on buying debt. CreXus first sold
shares to the public in September 2009, a month after Starwood.  Starwood said it would exchange 0.61 shares of its common
stock for each share of CreXus. The combined company would be
the largest U.S. REIT specializing in commercial mortgages by
stock-market value, Sternlicht said. Annaly, which focuses on
buying residential bonds, is the biggest mortgage REIT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
