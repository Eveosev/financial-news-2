Aeroports de Paris (ADP) , operator of the
French capital’s airports, may combine the Orly-Ouest and Orly-
Sud airports south of Paris,  Les Echos  reported, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Pierre Graff.  Growth at Orly-Ouest, where Air France SA operates, is
stagnating while Orly-Sud lacks space so the combination would
increase retail space and ease crowding, according to the
report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
