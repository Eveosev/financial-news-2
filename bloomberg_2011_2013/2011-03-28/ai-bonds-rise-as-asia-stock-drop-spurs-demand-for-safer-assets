Thailand ’s government bonds rose
and the baht headed for a quarterly loss as a slide in regional
stocks increased demand for the relative safety of the dollar
and fixed-income assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10-most-traded currencies, dropped as the MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of regional shares fell for the first time in
three days after radiation hampered efforts to cool damaged
nuclear reactors in Japan. The baht dropped 1 percent this
quarter, the second-worst performance among 10 major currencies
in Asia, as overseas investors sold $383 million more Thai
equities than they bought.  “Japan’s problem and the stock declines make people more
risk averse, weighing on the regional currencies,” said  Hideki
Hayashi , a global economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo .
“That means the bond markets are supported instead.”  The yield on the 3.125 percent debt due December 2015 slid
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.33 percent. The
onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive a floating payment, lost 2.5 basis points to 2.625
percent.  The baht declined 0.1 percent to 30.29 per dollar as of
8:28 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency may trade between 30.20 and 30.50 this week,
Hayashi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
