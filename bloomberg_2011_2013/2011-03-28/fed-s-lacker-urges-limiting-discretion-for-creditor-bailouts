President Jeffrey Lacker said regulators should set limits on
winding down financial companies to discourage firms from taking
on excessive risks or bypassing rules.  “There are risks in the long-term because firms seen as
enjoying broad safety net protection will have strong incentives
to take on excessive risks,” Lacker said in the text of
testimony prepared for a March 30 hearing of a House Financial
Services subcommittee on the Dodd-Frank Act. The testimony was
obtained today by Bloomberg News.  One idea is to limit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s
authority over winding down failing companies to ones that are
regulated as “systemically important,” Lacker said. To have
credibility, policy makers would have to allow “significant
creditor losses in cases in which they otherwise might have
provided support.”  Laura Fortunato, a spokeswoman for Lacker, didn’t
immediately respond to two telephone messages seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
