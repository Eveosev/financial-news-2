Chile’s government plans to extend
summer time by more than a month as it seeks ways to save energy
amid a drought that has cut hydroelectricity output,  El Mercurio 
reported.  Government authorities, who on March 2 extended summer time
by three weeks to April 2, will announce measures today to turn
clocks back an hour on May 7, the Santiago-based newspaper
 reported , citing government officials that it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
