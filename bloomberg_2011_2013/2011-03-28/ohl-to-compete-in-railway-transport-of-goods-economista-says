Spain ’s  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) 
aims to compete for contracts related to rail transportation of
goods through its Guinovart Rail unit,  El Economista  reported,
citing comments from Chairman Juan-Miguel Villar Mir.  The Spanish engineering and building company “wishes to be
a railway operator,” Villar Mir said, according to the
newspaper. The company may bet on projects for the
transportation of goods by train between France and Spain
through the Pyrenees, including those that Spain’s Development
Ministry will put out to tender, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
