Ghana’s cedi, the currency of
Africa’s second-biggest gold producer, appreciated against the
 U.S. dollar  as mining firms sold dollars to finance operations
in the West African nation.  The cedi traded at 1.5310 per dollar at 1:38 p.m. in Accra,
the capital, from 1.5330 at the close March 25, according to
data from Nigerian lender  Access Bank Plc. (ACCESS)   “Most of the banks are now selling dollars on the market,”
said Kwabena Owusu, a currency trader with the Accra office of
the bank, by phone. “They are talking about it coming from
mining.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
