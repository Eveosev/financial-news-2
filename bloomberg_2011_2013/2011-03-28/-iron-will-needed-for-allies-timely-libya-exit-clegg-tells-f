U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  said the “quite tough” moment would come when Britain
must recognise it “can’t do anymore” and the country’s
involvement in  Libya  has to end, the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview.  The U.K. and its allies should “avoid mission creep” and
“be prepared to show iron self-restraint at some point and
accept that there is a line beyond which we cannot and will not
go as an international community,” Clegg said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
