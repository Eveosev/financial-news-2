Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) ’s, the
builder of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai, agreed to pay the
first cash dividend since 2008 after a three-hour meeting that
saw heated arguments between the shareholders and executives.  The real-estate developer will pay a 10 percent cash
dividend for 2010, a total of about 600 million dirhams ($163.4
million), Chairman Mohamed Alabbar, who initially wasn’t
proposing a dividend, said today in Dubai. Such payment may
leave the company ill-prepared to face emergencies, he told
shareholders at the general assembly meeting today in Dubai.  “Everyone knows that the real estate market is going
through difficult times,” he said. “I know that most people
think that this year is difficult and next year is difficult and
the year after, maybe, God willing, easier.”  The company’s net income tumbled 62 percent in the fourth
quarter to 274 million dirhams, compared with 720 million
dirhams in the corresponding period a year earlier. Dubai home
prices slumped 62 percent from their peak in mid-2008 after the
global credit crisis caused mortgage lending to dry up and
speculative demand waned, Deutsche Bank AG said on Feb. 14.  Emaar, which opened the 200-story Burj Khalifa in January
2010, handed over 770 units in the residential and commercial
tower and 3,500 units in total. Buyers in Dubai pay for
apartments based on how much work is completed, with a final
amount due when keys are handed over.  Emaar shares rose 0.6 percent at to 3.18 dirhams at the
02:00 p.m. close in Dubai, the highest level since Feb. 15
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares are down 10
percent this year.  Shareholders Complained  Several shareholders complained during today’s meeting that
their investments in the company haven’t paid out in years and
demanded as much as a 30 percent dividend.  “If we pay what you are asking of us, we would be in
automatic default and we would breach our covenants with banks,
which stipulate the company’s needed cash position and other
requirements” Alabbar said repeatedly. Shareholders rejected
his proposal to pay a 500 million-dirham cash dividend and a 5
percent bonus share before agreeing to the 10 percent payout.  Emaar owns a 45 percent stake in Islamic mortgage provider
Amlak PJSC and has outstanding loans of 772.6 million dirhams to
the company, which was barred from trading in November 2008.  Emaar said in January that it sold $500 million in Islamic
bonds, and the company raised the same amount in December to
repay short-term loans. The developer plans to raise $2 billion
in total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
