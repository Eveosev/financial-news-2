Hungary ’s mortgage relief plan,
aimed at assisting distressed borrowers, may feature a partial
 exchange rate  fix on foreign-currency mortgages,  Magyar Nemzet 
said, citing a bank executive.  The plan, to be laid out jointly by the government and
commercial banks, could feature an exchange band for the Swiss
franc-forint cross with upper and lower limits, the newspaper
said, citing Daniel Gyuris, head of mortgage lending at
Hungary’s largest bank OTP Bank Nyrt. The government may offer
state guarantee for the repayment of debt stemming from the
exchange rate limitation, Gyursi said, according to Nemzet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
