U.S. regulators, including the
 Federal Reserve , said they’re considering proposed rules this
week under a law requiring companies to retain part of the risk
when they securitize and sell loans.  “All of the agencies participating in this joint
rulemaking process are expected to consider the rule this week
and a detailed announcement will be made when this process is
complete,” the regulators said today in a statement in
Washington, citing section 941 of last year’s Dodd-Frank Act
overhauling financial regulation.  The agencies include the Fed, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,  Federal
Housing Finance Agency , Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and Securities and Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
