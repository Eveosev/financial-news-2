Warren Buffett ’s $9 billion
takeover of  Lubrizol Corp. (LZ)  is scheduled to reward Chief
Executive Officer James Hambrick with about $97 million in cash
tied to his equity-based compensation.  Hambrick, 56, may receive cash payments of about $73
million on his stock options and about $24 million on his so-
called performance-share units, Lubrizol said in a March 25
regulatory filing. Hambrick, who also serves as chairman,
accepted the $135-a-share acquisition from Buffett’s  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  this month.  Buffett, 80, called Hambrick “a talented CEO” and said he
plans to leave the manager in charge after Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire completes the purchase. The takeover price was 28
percent higher than Lubrizol’s stock on the last trading day
before the deal was announced March 14. Lubrizol closed at
$32.60 on April 26, 2004, the day Hambrick was promoted to CEO.  “Lubrizol’s board has supported and approved the change-
in-control agreements that it deemed necessary and appropriate
in attracting and retaining top talent,” the company said today
in a statement. “These agreements, if they are triggered in
connection with the merger agreement with Berkshire Hathaway,
will be honored.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
