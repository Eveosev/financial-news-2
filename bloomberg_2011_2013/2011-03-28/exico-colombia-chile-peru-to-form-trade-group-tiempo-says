Mexico , Colombia, Chile and Peru
will form a trade zone with the “greatest possible free traffic
of capital, services, products and people,” Peru President  Alan Garcia  said in an  interview  with Colombia’s El Tiempo newspaper.  Garcia will meet with his counterparts from the other three
countries in Lima on May 2 to formalize the trade agreement, the
Bogota-based paper said.  “The countries that have a maritime border with Asia, that
share the Pacific, that believe in democracy, in modernizing
investment and in redistributive action by the state, are going
to identify ourselves and act together,” Garcia said, according
to the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
