(Corrects fourth paragraph in story published yesterday to
say that Banco Comercial Portugues is publicly traded and to
correct spelling of name.)  Standard & Poor’s  said it may
downgrade Portugal’s credit rating again this week after cutting
long- and short-term counterparty credit ratings today on five
Portuguese banks and two related subsidiaries.  “The negative CreditWatch implications on our long-term
counterparty credit ratings on the Portuguese banks reflect our
negative CreditWatch listing of the sovereign rating, and thus
the possibility of a further sovereign downgrade” that may
happen “as early as this week,” S&P said in an e-mailed
statement.  S&P said it may cut Portugal’s ratings by one notch after
downgrading its debt on March 25 by two levels, to BBB from A-,
two days after Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates tendered
his resignation.  S&P downgraded the counterparty credit ratings on Banco
Santander Totta SA, a unit of Spain’s Banco Santander SA; state-
owned Caixa Geral de Depositos SA;  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) ,
Portugal’s biggest publicly traded bank by market value;  Banco
BPI SA (BPI) , the country’s fifth-biggest lender; and  Banco Comercial
Portugues SA (BCP) , the country’s second-biggest publicly traded bank
by market value.  The long-term ratings remain on CreditWatch with negative
implications, S&P said.  Socrates offered to resign after opposition parties
rejected budget cuts aimed at reducing the deficit and staving
off a European Union-led bailout. The biggest opposition party,
the  Social Democrats , say they still support efforts to cut the
budget gap to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product this year
and 3 percent next, while voting against the current package.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
