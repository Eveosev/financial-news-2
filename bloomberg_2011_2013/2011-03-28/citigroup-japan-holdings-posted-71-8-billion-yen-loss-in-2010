Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s Japanese
investment banking and consumer finance business posted a loss
for a third straight year in 2010, led by a decline in
underwriting fees and brokerage commissions.  Citigroup Japan Holdings Corp. ’s loss narrowed to 71.8
billion yen ($878 million) for the year ended Dec. 31 from 391.6
billion yen in 2009, it said in a statement filed today to the
Ministry of Finance in Tokyo.  Total revenue fell 61 percent to 135.4 billion yen after
the bank sold its Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. brokerage unit
and part of its investment banking business to Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. in 2009. Citigroup Japan also set aside
more provisions for refunds of overcharged interest on consumer
loans following a government law change that capped rates.  Revenue from brokerage commissions, securities underwriting
and fees from advice on mergers and acquisitions declined 59
percent from a year earlier, according to the statement.  Citigroup employs 2,192 people at its Japanese brokerage
and consumer finance businesses, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
