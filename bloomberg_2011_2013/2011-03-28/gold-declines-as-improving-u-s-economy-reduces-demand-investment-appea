Gold prices fell for the third
straight session as signs the  U.S. economy  is improving drove
U.S. equities higher, eroding demand for the metal as an
alternative investment.  U.S. consumers increased spending more than forecast in
February as incomes climbed, government figures showed today,
and an index of pending home resales unexpectedly increased. The
economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter,
revised up from 2.8 percent estimated last month, data showed
last week. On March 24, gold futures rose to a record of
$1,448.60 an ounce on turmoil in  Japan  and the Middle East.  “The U.S. numbers have not been all that awful,” said
 Afshin Nabavi , a senior vice president at MKS Finance SA, a
bullion refiner in Geneva. “The market has had a huge move up,
and the higher we go up, the more chance of a bigger
correction.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell $6.30, or 0.4 percent,
to settle at $1,421.30 at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .  This quarter, prices are little changed after gaining in
the previous nine quarters.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose for the fourth
straight session, and Treasury two-year yields gained.  “The strong U.S. economic data provided some investors
with a good excuse to take profit after gold hit a record,”
said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at  Korea Exchange Bank (004940) 
Futures Co. in Seoul. “Bullion can soon resume the rally since
there are many uncertainties lingering: the euro zone debt
problems and the Middle East unrest, as well as the fallout from
the Japanese earthquake.”  Silver futures for May delivery rose 3.9 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $37.088 an ounce. The price headed for the ninth
straight quarterly gain.  Palladium futures for June delivery dropped $4.70, or 0.6
percent, to $745.70 an ounce.  Platinum futures for July delivery rose $2.40, or 0.1
percent, to $1,752.10 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
