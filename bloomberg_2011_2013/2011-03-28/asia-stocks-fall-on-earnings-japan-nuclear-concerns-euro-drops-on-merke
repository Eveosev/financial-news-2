U.S. stocks erased gains, dragged
down by consumer and technology companies, amid the slowest
trading of the year and mounting concern  Japan  is failing to
contain hazardous material at a nuclear plant. Yields on two-
year Treasuries increased for a sixth day as the government sold
$35 billion of the securities, while oil and the yen fell.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3 percent to
1,310.19 at 4 p.m. in New York, losing gains in the final 20
minutes of trading, as Marriott International Inc. and  EBay Inc. (EBAY) 
declined more than 4.2 percent. Two-year note yields rose two
basis points to 0.75 percent.  Portugal ’s 10-year bond yield
climbed to a euro-era record of 7.94 percent. Crude oil fell 1.4
percent to $103.98 a barrel. The yen slumped versus its major
counterparts.  Stock indexes in the U.S. dropped as radiation levels that
can prove fatal were detected outside reactor buildings at
Japan’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, while trading volume slowed to
5.96 billion shares on exchanges. Equities had rallied earlier,
sending the S&P 500 to a 0.5 percent gain, after consumer
spending and sales of existing homes topped projections.  “There’s a lot of uncertainty out there,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Milwaukee-based Robert
W. Baird & Co., which oversees $85 billion. “I’d expect the
market would struggle more, particularly with unknowns, not only
in Japan, but all across the Mideast and north  Africa .”  Marriott, EBay  Marriott lost 6.3 percent after the largest U.S. hotel
chain said revenue growth is being held back by weak North
American demand.  Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) 
slumped 5.7 percent. EBay Inc. slipped 4.3 percent after
announcing a $2.4 billion takeover of  GSI Commerce Inc. (GSIC)   Goodyear
Tire & Rubber Co. (GT)  fell 5.7 percent as it sold preferred stock.
 RadioShack Corp. (RSH)  rallied 5 percent after saying it will sell
Apple Inc.’s iPad 2 starting tomorrow.  European stocks rose, driving the Stoxx Europe 600 Index to
a 0.1 percent gain. Alcatel-Lucent SA and  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  climbed more
than 3.5 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. boosted its
rating on their shares. Vestas Wind Systems A/S led renewable-
energy companies higher after the  Green Party , which opposes
nuclear plants, ejected German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Christian Democrats from power in Stuttgart after 58 years.  Equities advanced earlier after Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis President  James Bullard  said the economy may be strong
enough to consider an end to stimulus. Also, the Commerce
Department said  consumer spending  rose 0.7 percent in the U.S.
during February, beating the median economist estimate that
called for 0.5 percent growth. A National Association of
Realtors index of pending home resales increased 2.1 percent,
while economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected no change.  ‘Still Chugging’  “The economy is still chugging along,” said Randy Bateman,
chief investment officer of Huntington Asset Management in
Columbus,  Ohio , which oversees about $14 billion. “Because of
the turmoil internationally -- what’s going on with the euro,
the revolutions -- it begs you to think where else can investors
go. Bonds don’t look good, international stocks don’t look good.
Where else is a safe haven than corporate America?”  The  S&P 500 , the benchmark measure of U.S. stocks, has
rallied 4.2 percent since Dec. 31, beating the 0.2 percent rise
by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, the 3 percent drop by the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index and the 1.1 percent slump for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of shares in 21 developing nations.  The two-year Treasury note yield earlier reached 0.78
percent, the highest level since March 4. The 30-year bond yield
was little changed at 4.50 percent. The difference between the
yields fell to 3.74 points, the narrowest since Dec. 31.  Portuguese Debt  Portuguese bonds fell on concern the nation will be forced
to accept financial aid. Portuguese 10-year yields were 15 basis
points higher at 7.93 percent after reaching 7.94 percent, the
most since 1997 when Bloomberg began collecting the data. The
two-year yield surged as much as 37 basis points to 7.443
percent, while the five-year yield climbed to 8.707 percent, the
highest since the euro was introduced in 1999.  The yen weakened 0.4 percent to 81.70 per dollar at 5:09
p.m. in  New York . The Japanese currency fell 0.4 percent to
115.10 per euro. The euro was little changed at $1.4087 after
falling as much as 0.5 percent.  The shekel extended gains versus the dollar after Bank of
Israel Governor Stanley Fischer unexpectedly raised the
benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point as inflation
accelerated and growth surged. It was the first increase of that
magnitude since 2005. The currency appreciated to 3.5240 per
dollar and touched 3.5193, the strongest level since January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
