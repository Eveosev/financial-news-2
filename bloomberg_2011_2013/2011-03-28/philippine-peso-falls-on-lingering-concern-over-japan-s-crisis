The Philippine peso dropped for the
first time in three days on concern  Japan ’s nuclear crisis will
curb demand for the Southeast Asian nation’s exports.  Rising radiation levels are hampering efforts to repair the
cooling systems at reactors at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant,
according to operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. Japan, which had
its worst earthquake on record on March 11, was the biggest
buyer of goods shipped from the Philippines in 2010.  “Uncertainty still persists in Japan,” said Lito Biacora,
vice president for treasury at Bank of the Philippine Islands in
 Manila . “The peso is just trading in a range.”  The peso fell 0.3 percent to close at 43.445 per dollar in
Manila, according to prices from inter-dealer broker Tullett
Prebon Plc. The currency appreciated 0.9 percent last week and
is 0.8 percent stronger this quarter.  The  Philippines  is keeping its annual economic growth
target of 7 percent to 8 percent for the period through 2016,
Edwin Lacierda, spokesman for President  Benigno Aquino , said in
a mobile phone message today. Aquino has said he’s aiming for
expansions of up to 8 percent a year.  Philippine three-year bonds fell, with the yield on the
6.25 percent note due January 2014 increasing two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.045 percent, according to
Tradition Financial Services. Last week’s closing level was the
lowest since Feb. 1. A basis point is one percentage point.  To contact the reporter for this story:
