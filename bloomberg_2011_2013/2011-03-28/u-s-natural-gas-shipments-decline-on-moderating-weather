Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. households slipped for a fourth day on forecasts of
moderating weather that may reduce demand for the heating fuel.
Shipments to the Northeast dropped for a second day.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to homes in the U.S. and
Canada shows shipments fell 0.8 percent to 35.6 million
dekatherms (34.6 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg as of 3:30 p.m. in  New York .  Residences in the Northeast were to receive 5.55 million
dekatherms of gas, down 1.7 percent from yesterday, Bloomberg
data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants dropped 6 percent
to 11.8 million dekatherms.  The low temperature in Boston early today was 28 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius), 7 below normal, according to
 Weather Underground  in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The overnight low
may be 29 degrees Fahrenheit, 6 below normal.  Wholesale gas delivered at the Algonquin City Gate hub,
which is the pricing point for Boston, fell 29.54 cents, or 5.1
percent, to $5.4666 per million British thermal units on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
gained 21.33 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $4.345 per million Btu.  To contact the reporters on this story:
