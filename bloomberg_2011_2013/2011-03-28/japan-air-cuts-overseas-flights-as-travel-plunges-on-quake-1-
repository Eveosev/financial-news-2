Japan Airlines Corp., the nation’s
flag carrier, slashed  China , South Korea and Hawaii flights
after an earthquake and nuclear crisis caused a 25 percent drop
in its international passenger numbers.  Cuts to Tokyo Narita airport operations starting April 6
include halting  Hong Kong  services, halving Beijing flights to
seven a week and paring Honolulu to 14 trips a week from 21, the
airline said in an e-mailed statement today. The reductions will
last until about April 27, it said.  The airline’s domestic loads have also fallen 28 percent
since the March 11 quake compared with a year ago, President
Masaru Onishi told reporters in Tokyo, as concerns about
radiation leaking from a nuclear-power plant and power shortages
damp travel to the capital. Singapore Airlines Ltd. has already
announced Tokyo-flight cuts, while Qantas Airways Ltd.’s budget
unit Jetstar has moved some services to  Osaka .  Japan Air also cut services to Shanghai, Seoul, Pusan and
Taipei. It will continue flying to Hong Kong from Tokyo’s Haneda
airport, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
