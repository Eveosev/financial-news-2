Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA,
Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, is planning to restructure
its exploration and production division to increase output and
boost efficiency, El Universal  reported .  The exploration and production division of PDVSA, as the
Caracas-based company is known, will create a new unit to
oversee projects in the heavy crude Orinoco Belt, the Venezuelan
newspaper reported today, without identifying where it got the
information. PDVSA’s oil output declined 3.9 percent last year
after disputes with oil service providers and refinery power
outages.  Eulogio Del Pino, a vice president at PDVSA, will continue
to head the exploration and production division, which will
absorb PDVSA’s unit that oversees international joint ventures
with private oil firms known as CVP, El Universal said.  A PDVSA spokesman declined to comment on the report when
contacted today by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
