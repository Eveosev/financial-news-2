Kuwait  isn’t involved in mediation
efforts between Bahrain’s government and its opponents, said
Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa.  “Any talk of Kuwaiti mediation in Bahrain is absolutely
untrue,” Sheikh Khalid wrote on his Twitter account today.
“There were previous endeavors that received no reaction and
were ended by the National Safety Law.”  The government of the Persian Gulf country quelled more
than a month of protests and declared a three-month state of
emergency on March 15 after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other
states in the region arrived to support the kingdom’s Sunni
monarch. Protesters, mostly from the island nation’s Shiite
majority community, had held mass rallies since Feb. 14 to
demand democracy and more civil rights.  Al-Seyassah  newspaper reported yesterday that officials
from al-Wefaq, Bahrain’s largest Shiite opposition bloc, arrived
in Kuwait to discuss a Kuwaiti initiative. Jassim al-Kharafi,
speaker of the parliament, will lead Kuwaiti mediation efforts,
the Kuwait-based newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
