Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened,
snapping a two-day rally, on speculation the prospect of
accelerating inflation is causing overseas investors to reduce
holdings of the nation’s assets. Benchmark bonds declined.  The currency retreated from near the highest in almost four
years after global funds sold $394 million more Indonesian
shares than they bought so far this month, exchange data show.
The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  fell 0.1 percent to 3,602.86 today,
recording two days of losses. Consumer prices rose 7.01 percent
in March from a year earlier, according to the median estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices rose 6.84 percent in
February. Inflation data for this month will be released on
April 1.  “Inflation concerns remain to the fore, with numbers out
later this week,” said  Prakriti Sofat , a Singapore-based
economist at Barclays Capital. “Whether the central bank will
raise  interest rates  again will be data-dependent.”  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 8,718 per dollar as of
4:36 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It reached 8,703 on March 23, the strongest since May 2007. The
rupiah has gained 3 percent this year, the best performance
among Asia’s ten most-traded currencies.  Policy makers will meet on April 12 to review the benchmark
lending rate. Bank Indonesia kept its reference rate unchanged
at 6.75 percent earlier this month, after raising it by 25 basis
points in February, the first increase since October 2008. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year  government bonds  fell. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 climbed one basis point to 8.12
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
