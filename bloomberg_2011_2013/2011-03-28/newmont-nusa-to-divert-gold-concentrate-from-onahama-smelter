PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara, the
Indonesian unit of  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , will divert gold and
copper concentrate normally shipped to Mitsubishi Materials
Corp.’s Onahama smelter north of Tokyo to five other Japanese
smelters, a spokesman said.  The diversion is due to Onahama ceasing operations after
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in  Japan , Kasan Mulyono, a
Newmont Nusa external relations manager, said in an interview
over the weekend, without elaborating on the volume of
concentrate being diverted.  Newmont Nusa expects to produce 226,800 ounces to 288,600
ounces of gold and 247 million pounds to 289 million pounds of
copper in 2011, less than he said. Company sales volume last
year is 656,000 ounces of gold and 489 million pounds of copper.  “The decrease from 2010 production levels is primarily due
to the processing of stockpiles as phase-6 stripping
continues,” Mulyono said.  The company plans to develop the Elang block in Sumbawa at
an estimated cost of possibly more than $3 billion, Arif
Perdanakusumah, senior external Relations manager, said at the
same event. An exploration phase will be conducted until 2017,
he said. A one-year feasibility study will then be conducted,
and construction will take a further two years, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
