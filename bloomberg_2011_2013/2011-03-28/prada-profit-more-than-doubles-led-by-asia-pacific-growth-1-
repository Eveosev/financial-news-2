Prada SpA, the Italian fashion
house that’s planning an initial public offering in  Hong Kong ,
said profit more than doubled last year, led by growth in the
Asia-Pacific region.  Net income rose to 250.8 million euros ($354 million) from
100.2 million euros in 2009, the Milan-based maker of Miu Miu
bags said today in a statement. Revenue increased 31 percent to
2.05 billion euros, with growth of 63 percent in  Asia , almost 30
percent in the U.S. and 20 percent in  Europe .  Prada plans an IPO of about $2 billion on the Hong Kong
exchange because it’s closer to the retailer’s fastest-growing
region. It’s the fifth time in the past decade that the luxury-
goods maker has attempted to sell shares.  “We have achieved the best sales and profitability results
in our company’s history and today the Prada Group can count on
a strong industrial and distribution platform, capable of
seizing the best opportunities in all markets,” Chief Executive
Officer Patrizio Bertelli said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
