A.G. Barr Plc, whose Irn-Bru soda
outsells Coca-Cola in  Scotland , said fiscal full-year profit
rose 26 percent as it gained market share on higher sales.  Net income in the year ended Jan. 29 rose to 22.6 million
pounds ($36.1 million), or 58.5 pence a share, from 17.9 million
pounds, or 46.5 pence, a year earlier, Cumbernauld, Scotland-
based Barr said in a statement today. Revenue increased 10
percent to 222.4 million pounds. Earnings and revenue beat
analysts’ estimates.  “We remain cautiously optimistic, but realistic about the
world we operate in,” Chief Executive Officer Roger White said
in a telephone interview today. “ Consumer confidence  is a
little more stretched this year than perhaps it was in 2010.”  Scotland is the only European country where the local soda
is more popular than Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola. Barr, which also
makes Tizer, Orangina and Lipton Ice Tea, is looking to boost
sales in bigger markets including England and  Russia .  The shares rose 46 pence, or 4 percent, to 1,201 pence in
London trading. That was the biggest gain in more than seven
months and the highest price in four months, valuing the company
at about 467 million pounds. The stock gained 25 percent in the
past year.  The U.K. soft drinks market grew 7 percent in value last
year and 3 percent in volume, said Barr, which owns Strathmore
Water, citing AC Nielsen Co. data.  Barr may be free of debt in 18 months to two years as
strong  cash flow  enables it to repay banks loans faster than
expected, White said. Sales for the first eight weeks of the
fiscal year are ahead of last year, the company said.  The company raised its total dividend for the year 10
percent to 25.4 pence a share.  “Barr’s results are ahead of expectations on all lines,”
 Collins Stewart Plc (CLST)  analyst Wayne Brown, who recommends
investors “buy” the shares, said in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
