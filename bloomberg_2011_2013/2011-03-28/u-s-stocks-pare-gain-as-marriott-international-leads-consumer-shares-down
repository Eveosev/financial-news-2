U.S. stocks pared gains as Marriott
International Inc. led consumer shares lower and concern grew
that  Japan  is failing to contain hazardous materials at its
damaged nuclear plants.  Marriott, the largest U.S. hotel chain, fell 6.8 percent
after saying growth in revenue per available room will be at the
low end of its forecast because of weak North American demand.
AT&T Inc. climbed 2.2 percent to lead telephone stocks higher
after Robert W. Baird & Co. analysts advised buying the shares
and Barron’s said the stock will rally if the acquisition of T-
Mobile USA is approved.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,315.03 at 11:45 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as 0.5
percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased
16.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,237.16.  The discovery of plutonium particles outside the stricken
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant means there has been degradation of the
nuclear fuel in at least one of the reactors.  It is from “plutonium which is formed inside the reactor”
International Atomic Energy Agency Deputy Director General of
Safety Denis Flory said today at a press briefing in Vienna.
“That means there is degradation of the fuel.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
