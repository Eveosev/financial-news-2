Following is the text of the U.S. personal income
and spending report for Feb. released by the Commerce Department.  Personal income increased $38.1 billion, or 0.3 percent, and disposable personal
income (DPI) increased $36.0 billion, or 0.3 percent, in February, according to
the  Bureau of Economic Analysis . Personal consumption expenditures (PCE)
increased $69.1 billion, or 0.7 percent.  In January, personal income increased
$147.4 billion, or 1.2 percent, DPI increased $92.0 billion, or 0.8 percent, and
PCE increased $29.5 billion, or 0.3 percent, based on revised estimates.  Real disposable income decreased 0.1 percent in February, in contrast to an
increase of 0.5 percent in January.  Real PCE increased 0.3 percent, in contrast
to a decrease of less than 0.1 percent.  2010                            2011  Oct.         Nov.         Dec.         Jan.

special factors.  Reduced employee contributions for government social
insurance, which reflected provisions of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance
Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, boosted DPI in January by reducing
the employee social security contribution rates (employee contributions for
government social insurance are a subtraction in the calculation of personal
income).  This effect was partly offset by the expiration of the Making Work Pay
provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which boosted
personal current taxes and reduced DPI (personal current taxes are a subtraction
in the calculation of DPI). Excluding these two special factors, which are
discussed more fully below, DPI increased $36.0 billion, or 0.3 percent, in
February, following an increase of $25.2 billion, or 0.2 percent, in January.  Wages and salaries  Private wage and salary disbursements increased $16.4 billion in February,
compared with an increase of $16.7 billion in January.  Goods-producing
industries' payrolls decreased $1.0 billion, in contrast to an increase of $12.0
billion; manufacturing payrolls decreased $1.6 billion, in contrast to an
increase of $8.3 billion.  Services-producing industries' payrolls increased
$17.4 billion, compared with an increase of $4.7 billion.  Government wage and
salary disbursements increased $0.3 billion, compared with an increase of $2.5
billion.  Other personal income  Employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds increased $2.7
billion in February, compared with an increase of $3.5 billion in January.  Employer contributions for government social insurance increased $1.0 billion in
February, compared with an increase of $8.9 billion in January.  The January
change reflected an increase in the tax rates paid by employers to state
unemployment insurance funds, which had boosted January contributions by $7.5
billion.  (Changes in employer contributions for government social insurance do
not affect personal income, because employer contributions for government social
insurance are also included in total contributions for government social
insurance, which is a subtraction in the calculation of personal income.)  Proprietors' income increased $2.9 billion in February, compared with an
increase of $4.2 billion in January.  Farm proprietors' income increased $0.5
billion, the same increase as in January. Nonfarm proprietors' income increased
$2.5 billion in February, compared with an increase of $3.7 billion in January.  Rental income of persons increased $8.3 billion in February, compared with an
increase of $8.2 billion in January.  Personal income receipts on assets
(personal interest income plus personal dividend income) increased $7.7 billion,
compared with an increase of $8.8 billion.  Personal current transfer receipts
increased $1.1 billion, in contrast to a decrease of $0.1 billion.  Contributions for government social insurance -- a subtraction in calculating
personal income --  increased $2.2 billion in February, in contrast to a
decrease of $94.6 billion in January.  The January change reflected decreases in
personal contributions for government social insurance and increases in employer
contributions.  The January change in personal contributions for government
social insurance reflected the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance
Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, which temporarily decreased the
social security contribution rate for employees and self-employed workers by 2.0
percentage points for 2011, or $105.4 billion in January.  As noted above,
employer contributions were boosted $7.5 billion in January by increases in the
unemployment insurance rate.  Personal current taxes and disposable personal income  Personal current taxes increased $2.2 billion in February, compared with an
increase of $55.4 billion in January.  The January change reflected the
expiration of the Making Work Pay Credit provision of the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009, which had boosted federal withheld income taxes by
$38.6 billion in January.  The January change also reflected increased federal
net nonwitheld income taxes (payments of estimated taxes plus final settlements
less refunds), which had boosted January net withheld taxes by $11.3 billion.
Disposable personal income (DPI) -- personal income less personal current taxes
-- increased $36.0 billion, or 0.3 percent, in February, compared with an
increase of $92.0 billion, or 0.8 percent in January.  Personal outlays and personal saving  Personal outlays -- PCE, personal interest payments, and personal current
transfer payments -- increased $69.8 billion in February, compared with an
increase of $30.2 billion in January.  PCE increased $69.1 billion, compared
with an increase of $29.5 billion.  Personal saving -- DPI less personal outlays -- was $676.7 billion in February,
compared with $710.5 billion in January.  Personal saving as a percentage of
disposable personal income was 5.8 percent in February, compared with 6.1
percent in January.  For a comparison of personal saving in BEA's national
income and product accounts with personal saving in the Federal Reserve Board's
flow of funds accounts and data on changes in net worth, go to

February, in contrast to an increase of 0.5 percent in January.  Real PCE -- PCE adjusted to remove price changes -- increased 0.3 percent in
February, in contrast to a decrease of less than 0.1 percent in January.
Purchases of durable goods increased 1.4 percent, compared with an increase of
0.2 percent.  Purchases of motor vehicles and parts accounted for most of the
increase in durable goods in February. Purchases of nondurable goods increased
0.4 percent in February, in contrast to a decrease of 0.1 percent in January.
Purchases of services increased less than 0.1 percent, in contrast to a decrease
of 0.1 percent.  PCE  price index  -- The price index for PCE increased 0.4 percent in February,
compared with an increase of 0.3 percent in January.  The PCE price index,
excluding food and energy, increased 0.2 percent, the same increase as in
January.  Revisions  Estimates have been revised for October 2010 through January 2011.  Changes in
personal income, current-dollar and chained (2005) dollar DPI, and current-
dollar and chained (2005) dollar PCE for December and January -- revised and as
published in last month's release -- are shown below.  Change from preceding month  December  Previous   Revised   Previous   Revised  (Billions of dollars)      (Percent)
