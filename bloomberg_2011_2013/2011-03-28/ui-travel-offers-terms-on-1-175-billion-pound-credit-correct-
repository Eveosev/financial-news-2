TUI Travel Plc (TT/) ,  Europe ’s largest
tour operator, proposed terms on credit facilities totaling as
much as 1.175 billion pounds ($1.9 billion), according to two
people with direct knowledge of the deal.  TUI offered to pay initial interest of 185 basis points
over benchmark rates on a 4.25-year multicurrency revolving
credit line of up to 1 billion pounds, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the transaction is private.  Lenders will also get a commitment fee of 40 percent of the
interest margin and a utilization fee of 20 basis points if a
third of the facility is drawn and 40 basis points if two thirds
is drawn, according to the people. Money in a revolving credit
can be borrowed again once it’s been repaid. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  The Crawley, England-based company is also seeking a 175
million-pound letter of credit, for which banks have been
invited to lend on a bilateral basis, said the people.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is coordinating both parts
of the financing, which will refinance loans maturing next year,
according to the people.  “It is public knowledge that TUI Travel has credit
facilities which mature in June 2012,” said a company
spokeswoman in an e-mailed response to questions. “We are at a
preliminary stage in determining our refinancing options,
details of which are confidential.”  TUI has three revolving credit lines maturing next year,
which include a 910 million-pound deal signed in 2007 and two
transactions totaling 150 million pounds signed last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  TUI agreed to pay initial interest of 75 basis points over
the  London  interbank offered rate on funds drawn from the 2007
deal, Bloomberg data show. The deal from last year paid 275
basis points more than Libor, the rate banks charge to lend to
each other.  To contact the reporter on this story:
