Saudi Aramco , the world’s biggest
oil company, has been asked by Jubail City’s local council to
provide land for its employees so that they can build their own
houses,  Saudi Gazette  reported, citing Jubail’s governor.  The land would help solve the industrial city’s housing
problem, Abdulmuhsin al-Otaishan said yesterday after a council
session, the newspaper reported.  Saudi Arabia ’s King Abdullah ordered a $67 billion spending
package on March 18 as protests calling for better employment
opportunities and democracy engulfed the Middle East.  To contact the reporters on this story:
