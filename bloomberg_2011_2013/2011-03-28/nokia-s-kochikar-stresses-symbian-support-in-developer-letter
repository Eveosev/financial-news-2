Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  will continue to support
its Symbian operating system and Qt tools as it rolls out a new
product line based on Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Phone 7, Purnima
Kochikar, vice president of the Forum Nokia developer program,
said on its website.  “Windows Phone will not have all language and all
localization capabilities from day one,” Kochikar wrote in a
letter to developers. Markets such as  China ,  India , Russia and
Turkey are likely to “play a more significant role” in selling
further Symbian devices after the Windows Phone models start to
appear elsewhere, she said.   Nokia will ship new Symbian models during 2011 and 2012 and
push the next major user interface update to existing as well as
new users this summer, she said. The company aims to shift
Symbian users to Nokia Windows Phone models, "so it would not be
in our interests to undermine their Nokia smartphone
experience," she added.      Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
