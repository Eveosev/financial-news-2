The yield on  Israel ’s 10-year
government bond held around the highest since the notes were
issued in November 2009 on bets the central bank will increase
its main lending rate today. The shekel strengthened.  Bank of Israel Governor of  Stanley Fischer , who has raised
the benchmark rate for two consecutive months, will increase the
rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.75 percent at the policy
meeting today, according to 15 of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. One expects an increase to 3 percent and four predict
the rate will remain at 2.5 percent. The decision will be
announced at 5:30 p.m. in  Jerusalem .  “Yields are moving at a slower pace than in the past few
days as the market is not sure by how much the central bank will
raise the interest rate,” Guy Lazarovich, a bond trader at IBI-
Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by
telephone.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 rose,
pushing the yield down 1 basis point to 5.33 percent at 12:26
p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The yield has gained 64 basis points this
quarter, including 11 basis points over the past week.  Fischer has gradually increased the rate by 2 percentage
points since August 2009 in a bid to moderate shekel gains and
help exporters compete in world markets. The Israeli currency,
has gained 5.7 percent over the past year.  The shekel strengthened for a second day, increasing 0.6
percent to 3.5370 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
