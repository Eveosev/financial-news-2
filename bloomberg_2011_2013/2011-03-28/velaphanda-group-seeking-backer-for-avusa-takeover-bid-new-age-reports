Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG)  has been
seeking a financial backer in London to help finance a bid for
the shares in  Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  that it doesn’t already own,
Johannesburg’s New Age newspaper reported, citing unidentified
people with knowlege of the plans.  While London’s  Pearson Plc (PSON) , which runs a joint venture in
South Africa with Avusa, would back Mvelaphanda’s plans it won’t
give a takeover bid financial support, the New Age said, citing
a person close to Mvelaphanda.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
