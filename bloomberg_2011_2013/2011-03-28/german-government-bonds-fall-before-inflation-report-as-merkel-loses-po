German government bonds declined as
investors increased wagers on higher  interest rates  from the
 European Central Bank  before a report tomorrow that’s forecast
to show inflation stayed at a two-year high in March.  Portuguese bonds fell, pushing yields up to euro-era
records on concern the nation will be forced to accept financial
aid.  Germany ’s inflation rate probably stayed at 2.2 percent,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said last week he
has “nothing to add” to his March 3 statement that policy
makers may raise the key rate from a record low of 1 percent at
their April 7 meeting.  “It’s clear that yields have to rise as the ECB is getting
ready to raise interest rates in April, which is just around the
corner,” said  Glenn Marci , a strategist at DZ Bank AG in
 Frankfurt . “The going is very good in the German economy.”  The German 10-year bund yield gained two basis points to
3.30 percent at 4:34 p.m. in London, after reaching 3.33
percent, the most since March 4. The 2.5 percent security due
January 2021 fell 0.15, or 1.5 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,411)
face amount, to 93.41. Two-year yields rose one basis point to
1.74 percent, set for a fourth month of increases.  Portuguese 10-year yields were 15 basis points higher at
7.93 percent after reaching 7.94 percent, the most since 1997
when Bloomberg began collecting the data. The two-year yield
surged as much as 37 basis points to 7.443 percent, while the
five-year yield climbed to 8.707 percent, the highest since the
euro was introduced in 1999.  Consumer Confidence   German government bonds have lost investors 2 percent this
year while Treasuries are little changed, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. The Portuguese index declined 6 percent
while Spanish debt returned 2.9 percent.  Consumer confidence in Europe’s largest economy will
probably stay near its highest level since 2007 in April, GfK AG
may say tomorrow, adding to speculation the euro area’s debt
crisis won’t deter the ECB from raising rates. The Nuremburg-
based market research company will probably say that its
consumer sentiment index will drop to 5.8 from 6, the most since
October 2007, according to the median of 19 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Selling Bonds  Euribor futures dropped, sending the yield on the contract
expiring in December up three basis points to 2.08 percent,
indicating traders are adding to bets for higher borrowing costs
from the Frankfurt-based central bank. The rate rose earlier to
as much as 2.105 percent, matching the highest since March 10.  Europe ’s biggest banks are selling their holdings of
Portuguese bonds, reducing risk as they prepare for financial
stress testing, the Sunday Times reported yesterday, citing
people familiar with the lenders’ behavior.  Portuguese securities slid last week after Prime Minister
 Jose Socrates  resigned on March 23 following opposition parties’
rejection of budget cuts, stoking concern the country may
struggle to repay about 9 billion euros of debt due by June.  Fitch Ratings  cut the nation’s debt rating to A- from A+ on
March 24, and  Standard & Poor’s  followed with a downgrade to
BBB, citing “increased political uncertainty.”  Portugal ’s credit rating may be cut further as soon as this
week, S&P said in a statement today.  Italian Sales  Italian 10-year bonds dropped as the country sold 2.5
billion euros of 2012 bonds and 8 billion euros of bills
maturing in 183 days. The zero-coupon 2012 bonds were sold at an
average yield of 2.451 percent, compared with 2.55 percent at
the previous auction of the securities on Feb. 23. Investors bid
for 1.52 times the amount of bonds on sale, down from a so-
called bid-to-cover of 1.68 times on Feb. 23.  The 183-day Treasury bills were sold at an average yield of
1.396 percent, compared with 1.307 percent at the previous
auction of similar-maturity securities held Feb. 23.  The 10-year yield gained two basis points to 4.78 percent.
Irish 10-year yields were five basis points lower at 10.07
percent and equivalent Greek yields were six basis points higher
at 12.63 percent.  Italy plans to sell 1.75 billion euros of inflation-
protected securities due 2016 tomorrow, and 9.25 billion euros
of notes due 2014, 2017 and 2021 on March 30.  Spanish Performance  “We won’t see enormous pressure due to the auctions,”
said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at
UniCredit SpA in Milan. “We have abundant redemptions this
week, so there’s plenty of liquidity to support the auctions.
Maybe this liquidity will end up in the shorter maturities.”  Spanish  government bonds ’ “strong performance” relative
to benchmark German securities may be a sign the sovereign-debt
crisis in the euro area is easing, according to  Barclays
Capital .  “The worst of the systemic risk associated with peripheral
Europe is most likely behind us,”  Moyeen Islam , a fixed-income
strategist at the investment-banking unit of Barclays Plc, wrote
today in an e-mailed note. “The market’s focus should, in time,
shift back towards inflation and monetary policy.”  The difference in yield between Spanish and German 10-year
bonds narrowed two basis points to 188 basis points, after
reaching 186 basis points, the lowest level since Feb. 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
