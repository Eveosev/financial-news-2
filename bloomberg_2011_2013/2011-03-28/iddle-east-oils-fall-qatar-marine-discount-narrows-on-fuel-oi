Middle East crudes for sale to  Asia 
fell on concern that  Japan ’s nuclear crisis will delay
rebuilding efforts. The discount that buyers paid for Qatar
Marine narrowed.  Oman oil for immediate loading declined 73 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $109 a barrel today, according to Bloomberg data.
Dubai for loading in May was down 0.5 percent at $108.90 and
Murban crude declined 0.6 percent to $112.49.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., fell 10
cents to a premium of 23 cents to official selling prices,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The discount of Qatar Marine for May loading, a grade rich
in fuel oil, narrowed to 5 cents a barrel from 6 cents on March
25 as Japan’s demand for power-generation fuels to replace
nuclear capacity increased.  The crisis has shrunk  fuel oil ’s discount to benchmark
Dubai crude to $9.27 a barrel compared with $10.24 a week
earlier, data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. showed. Prices of
Qatar Marine were at a premium of 11 cents on March 21.  Oman futures for May delivery fell 44 cents to $109.06 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 4:32 p.m. Singapore
time, with 945 contracts traded. The settlement price was set at
$108.86 a barrel at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  The Brent-Dubai exchange of futures for swaps, or EFS, for
May narrowed 2 cents to $6.40 a barrel, according to data from
PVM, a broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
