Television ratings for the college
basketball men’s tournament are the best since 1993 in the first
year of a new broadcast accord between  CBS Sports  and Turner
Sports.  The overall tournament average for games on  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s CBS
network and  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s TBS, TNT and truTv is 6.8 percent
of households in the top 56 U.S. television markets, the
networks said in a news release, citing Nielsen Media Research.
That’s 15 percent higher than the 5.9 rating the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament earned in 2010, when
CBS was the sole rights-holder.  CBS and Turner agreed last April on a 14-year, $10.8
billion contract for broadcast, Internet and wireless rights on
the tournament, which this year expanded to 68 teams from 65.
The networks combined to show all 16 games in their entirety the
initial Thursday and Friday of the tournament for the first
time.  CBS will air the semifinals and final, which are being held
in Houston. In one of the April 2 semifinals, the University of
 Kentucky  will face the University of Connecticut, and Butler
University will take on Virginia Commonwealth University in the
other matchup.  The national title game is April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
