India  is seeking to have Germany’s
Bundesbank act as an intermediary for the South Asian country’s
oil imports from  Iran ,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing Indian
Finance Ministry official Neeta Bhushan.  The effort, which has the approval of the German foreign
and economy ministries, would involve the German central bank
channeling Indian payments for Iranian oil through the Hamburg-
based European-Iranian Trade Bank, the newspaper said today. The
Frankfurt-based Bundesbank declined to comment, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
