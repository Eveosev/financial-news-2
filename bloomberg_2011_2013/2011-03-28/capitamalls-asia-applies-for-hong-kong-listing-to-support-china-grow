CapitaMalls Asia Ltd. (CMA) , a unit of
Southeast Asia’s biggest developer, submitted an application for
a secondary listing in  Hong Kong  to complement its growth
strategy in  China .  A secondary listing on the main board of the Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong Ltd. will enhance the company’s “attractiveness”
to investors in Hong Kong and mainland China, the Singapore-
traded retail property unit of  CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL)  said in a
statement to the Singapore stock exchange today.  “With its increasing disposable income and urbanization,
we remain confident that China will continue to experience
strong retail sales growth,” Chairman Liew Mun Leong said in
the statement. “With our current 53 malls in 34 cities in China,
we are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth.”  China accounts for 37 percent of CapitaMalls Asia’s total
property portfolio by value, Chief Executive Officer Lim Beng Chee said in the statement. The company announced on Feb. 17 it
plans to double its presence to 100 malls in China within the
next three to five years.  CapitaMalls Asia’s shares were suspended from trading today.
They declined 8.8 percent this year to March 25, compared with a
3.7 percent drop in Singapore’s  Straits Times Index (FSSTI) , of which
the company is a constituent, over the period.  China International Capital Corp. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
are joint sponsors of the proposed secondary listing, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
