Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s decision to hold quarterly news briefings could lead
to misunderstandings regarding monetary policy, said  William
Poole , former president of the St. Louis Fed.  “The question is whether it will be constructive from a
monetary policy perspective,” Poole said today in an interview
on Bloomberg Radio’s “Hays Advantage” with  Kathleen Hays .
“I’m not convinced.”  The Fed announced last week that Bernanke will hold his
first briefing following the Fed’s meeting on interest rates and
the economy on April 27. The Fed typically issues printed
statements following their meetings.  Regarding the outlook for the economy, Poole said, “It
does look as though things are picking up.”  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
