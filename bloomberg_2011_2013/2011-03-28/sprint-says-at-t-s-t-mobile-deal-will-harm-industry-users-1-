Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-
largest U.S. wireless provider, said  AT&T Inc. (T) ’s planned
$39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA will damage industry
competition and called on the government to block it.  “This transaction will harm consumers and harm competition
at a time when the country can least afford it,” Vonya McCann,
Sprint government affairs senior vice president, said today in a
statement. “Sprint urges the United States government to block
this anti-competitive acquisition.”  Sprint said in the statement that the industry would be
dominated by two carriers, the combined AT&T-T-Mobile and
Verizon Wireless. AT&T said March 20 it agreed to buy T-Mobile
from parent  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , pending government approval.
The deal would combine the second- and fourth-largest U.S.
wireless providers.  Dan Hesse, Sprint’s chief executive officer, said last week
in an interview that the  Overland Park , Kansas-based carrier
planned to file objections to the U.S. Congress when it begins
its review of the merger.  Sprint rose 5 cents to $4.73 at 3:03 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. AT&T added 75 cents to $29.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
