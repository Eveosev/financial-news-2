Ethanol futures slid in  Chicago  as
corn declined on bets that farmers will increase plantings of
the biofuel component, which may lower production costs.  The grain-based gasoline additive followed corn lower on
speculation corn prices that have gained 88 percent in the past
year will encourage farmers to boost plantings over other
grains. Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S.  “If you look at the economics, corn kind of wins out,”
said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone Inc. in  Des
Moines ,  Iowa . “Ethanol actually held in decent for the most
part. It’s still a follower of corn.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery slipped 1.9 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.485 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 60 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  lost 2 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.61 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
declined 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.515, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf fell 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$2.645 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel dropped 1.5
cent, or 0.6 percent, to $2.71.  Corn for May delivery slumped 18.5 cents, or 2.7 percent,
to $6.71 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes about 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
