AT&T Inc. (T) ’s bullish options trading
surged to the highest level in almost three months, boosted by
one of today’s biggest U.S. block trades.  More than 163,000 calls to buy share of the second-largest
U.S. wireless carrier changed hands as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
7.2 times the four-week average and quadruple the number of puts
to sell. The shares rose 1.8 percent to $29.36, the highest
since January.  The July $33 calls were the most-active on the stock after
a block of 48,481 changed hands for 6 cents each at 3:41 p.m. in
the ninth-largest U.S. block trade of the day. AT&T’s July $31
calls were the second-most active after a block of 30,000 traded
for 31 cents at 3:59 p.m.  AT&T said March 20 that it agreed to buy  T-Mobile USA  from
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  for $39 billion in cash and stock to create
America’s largest mobile-phone company. The Dallas-based company
said it expects that it will take a year to get approval from
regulators. If approved, the merger would make the combined
entity the largest U.S. wireless carrier by customers. AT&T is
the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier after Verizon Wireless,
while T-Mobile is the fourth-largest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
