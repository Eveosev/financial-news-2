The University of  North Dakota  is
favored by oddsmakers to win its eighth college hockey
championship after top-ranked  Yale University  was eliminated
from the national tournament.  North Dakota scored five third-period goals yesterday to
beat the University of Denver  6-1  and advance to the  Frozen Four 
in  St. Paul , Minnesota. The Fighting Sioux improved their record
to 32-8-3 and will play the University of Michigan in one
national semifinal on April 7.  North Dakota’s seven National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament hockey titles are tied with Denver for
second all-time, two behind Michigan.  The Fighting Sioux have even odds of winning the
championship, according to the Las Vegas Hilton’s Race and
Sports Book, meaning a winning $10 bet would return $10 along
with the initial stake.  Michigan  is the second choice at 7-2, as
the Wolverines (28-10-4) make their record-extending 24th
appearance in the Frozen Four.  Minnesota-Duluth (24-10-6) plays the University of Notre
Dame (25-13-5) in the other April 7 semifinal at Xcel Energy
Center in St. Paul. Minnesota-Duluth, which has 15-4 odds,
ousted top-seeded Yale two days ago. Notre Dame is a 4-1 title
chance following last night’s 2-1 victory over New Hampshire.  The title game is scheduled for April 9.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
