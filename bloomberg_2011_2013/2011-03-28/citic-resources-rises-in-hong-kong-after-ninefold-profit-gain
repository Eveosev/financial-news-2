Citic Resources Holdings Ltd. (1205) , the
Chinese metal producer turned energy supplier, rose in Hong Kong
trading after posting a ninefold increase in annual profit.  The shares climbed as much as 1.2 percent to HK$1.72, up
for the second day. The stock advanced 0.6 percent to HK$1.71 at
10:10 a.m. local time, compared with the 0.2 percent gain in the
benchmark  Hang Seng  index.  Net income rose to HK$1.1 billion ($141 million) last year
from HK$115.7 million in 2009. Citic Resources made a HK$2.65
billion gain from the spinoff of its manganese unit Citic Dameng
Holdings Ltd. and an income tax credit of HK$406 million,
according to yesterdayâ€™s earnings statement.  Revenue increased 66 percent to HK$32.25 billion last year,
Citic Resources said.  Production at the Karazhanbas oilfield in Kazakhstan
reached about 35,500 barrels a day last year and realized  oil
prices  rose about 22 percent in 2010, according to the statement.  Citic Resources made a provision of HK$2.5 billion on the
Kazakh oilfield, partly because it reduced estimates for the
amount of reserves in the field, the company said, without
elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
