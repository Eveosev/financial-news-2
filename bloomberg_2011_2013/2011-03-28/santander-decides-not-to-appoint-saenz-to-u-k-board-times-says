Banco Santander SA (SAN)  has dropped a
plan to have Alfredo Saenz, its chief executive officer, join
its U.K. board after he was suspended from working as a banker
for three months in  Spain  by the Spanish  Supreme Court , which
upheld a conviction against him for making a false accusation in
connection with Banesto, a Santander unit, the London-based
Times reported without saying where it got the information.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
