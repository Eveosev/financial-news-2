Croatia ’s  market regulator 
suspended trading in INA Industrija Nafte d.d. stock until April
1, the watchdog said today in a statement on its website.  In a separate statement to the  Zagreb stock exchange  today,
the market regulator said it acted “following significant
trading by foreign investors” and to protect INA’s
shareholders.  The move follows the arrest on March 25 of INA Chief
Executive Officer Bojan Milkovic on corruption charges. An
investigative judge ordered Milkovic to be held for 30 days as
an investigation continues. Milkovic became the chief of INA,
controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt, in June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
