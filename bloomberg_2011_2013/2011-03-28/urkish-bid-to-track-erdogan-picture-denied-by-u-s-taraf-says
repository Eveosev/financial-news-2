The U.S.  Justice Department 
rejected a Turkish prosecutor’s request for help tracking an e-
mail address linked to images of Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s head superimposed on a pig,  Taraf  newspaper said.  The request by the state prosecutor in Trabzon would force
the U.S. to act contrary to its constitutional obligation to
protect free speech, Taraf cited the U.S. response as saying.  The Turkish prosecutor was trying to find the creator of
the images, which were posted at a local university and
connected to an address on Google Inc.’s gmail service, Taraf
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
