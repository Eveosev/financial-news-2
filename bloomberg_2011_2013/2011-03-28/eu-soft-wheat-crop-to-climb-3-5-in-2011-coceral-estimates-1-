The European Union soft-wheat
harvest is set to rise 3.5 percent this year as higher yields
lift production in  Germany  and the U.K., grain-industry lobby
Coceral said.  The crop is estimated at 131.4 million metric tons in 2011,
up from 127.1 million tons a year earlier, the Brussels-based
group said. The bloc’s overall grain harvest will advance 3.7
percent to 284.7 million tons, it predicted.  Coceral’s outlook compares with last week’s forecast by
farm group Copa-Cogeca for a soft-wheat crop of 129.7 million
tons and the European Commission’s January prediction for a
131.9 million-ton harvest. The EU is the world’s largest wheat-
growing region.  Soft-wheat planting will expand to 23.3 million hectares
(57.6 million acres) from 23 million hectares in the prior year,
with the average EU yield climbing to 5.64 tons a hectare from
5.52 tons, based on the Coceral forecast.  Production of soft wheat in  France , the biggest EU grower
and second-largest global exporter, will advance to 36.4 million
tons from 35.7 million tons, the group estimated.  Germany’s harvest of the grain will climb to 24.4 million
tons from 23.3 million tons, while U.K. farmers will reap 15.5
million tons of soft wheat, compared with 14.4 million tons in
2010, Coceral forecast.  EU-wide production of durum wheat, the hard variety used to
make pasta and couscous, will slip to 8.27 million tons from 8.6
million tons, Coceral said. Barley output will rise to 54.5
million tons from 52.9 million tons.  The 2011 corn harvest in the EU is forecast to climb to
59.2 million tons from 55.1 million tons on bigger crops in
France,  Italy ,  Hungary  and  Romania , according to the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
