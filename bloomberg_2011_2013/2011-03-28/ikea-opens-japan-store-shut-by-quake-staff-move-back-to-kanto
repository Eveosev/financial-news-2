Ikea Group opened one store in
 Japan ’s Kanagawa prefecture that had to be shut after the March
11 earthquake, the country’s strongest on record, Chiharu Ohhata,
a spokeswoman, said today.  Most of the Ikea workers who had been moved from the Kanto
region to the Kansai prefecture west of Tokyo, including Mikael
Palmquist, the country manager, have returned, Ohhata said in a
phone interview. The Kanto region, which includes Kanagawa,
encompasses the Japanese capital and six prefectures, and
maintains about one-third of Japan’s 127 million people.  About 20 percent of the company’s 1,000 workers in Tokyo
were temporarily moved Kansai for their safety and to save
electricity in Ikea’s Japan headquarters and stores, she said.
The stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant has leaked radiation into
the air and sea as well as into food and water supplies.
Radiation levels that can be fatal were detected outside the
facility’s reactor buildings, complicating efforts to contain
the worst disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.  Ohhata declined to comment on when Ikea’s two other stores
in the Kanto area, which were also shut, may be opened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
