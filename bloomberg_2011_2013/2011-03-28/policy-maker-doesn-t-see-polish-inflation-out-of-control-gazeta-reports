Polish inflation hasn’t spun “out
of control” and central bank projections show the rate will
start falling slowly, central bank Governor Marek Belka was
quoted today as saying in an interview with the newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza.  As Poland’s economic recovery gathers speed, “we’ve known
for some time that interest rates need to be increased; the
question was when,” Belka said, according to the newspaper. For
now, the economy is growing at a “moderate” pace that “isn’t
generating inflationary impulses,” Gazeta quoted Belka as
saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
