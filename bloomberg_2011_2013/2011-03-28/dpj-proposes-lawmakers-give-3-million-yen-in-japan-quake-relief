Japan ’s ruling party proposed that
every member of parliament contribute 3 million yen ($36,700) of
their annual salary to help victims of this month’s record
earthquake and tsunami.  Democratic Party of Japan  Secretary-General Katsuya Okada
said the party agreed on the proposal because legislators are
prohibited from making individual donations. Lawmakers make
about 1.3 million yen a month, according to parliamentary data.  “We want to donate money to demonstrate our sympathy,”
Okada told reporters today in Tokyo. “The DPJ has decided to do
so, but we need the agreement of other parties to implement
this.”  The Liberal Democratic Party and the New Komeito Party have
agreed to the proposal, Kyodo News said today, without saying
where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
