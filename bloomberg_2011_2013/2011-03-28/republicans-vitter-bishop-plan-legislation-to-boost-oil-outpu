Senator David Vitter of  Louisiana 
and Representative Rob Bishop of Utah, both Republicans, will
propose legislation this week aimed at raising U.S. oil
production to help cut reliance on foreign imports.  The lawmakers are seeking to open additional areas for
drilling and speed the process for issuing exploration permits,
Luke Bolar, Vitter’s spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview.  “This bill reduces our dependence on foreign oil -- often
from countries with unstable leaders like  Muammar Qaddafi ,”
Vitter said in a reference to the Libyan colonel. “It would put
many more Americans back to work than any of the other ‘job
creation’ plans we’ve seen before Congress, while also reducing
our federal and trade deficits.”  The bill would expand offshore drilling, change the
permitting process and revise the  Clean Air Act , Bolar said,
declining to provide details before the bill is released.  Oil prices advanced 27 percent in the past year as
political unrest spread from Tunisia and Egypt to Libya, Yemen,
Bahrain and Syria. The U.S. let six operators start exploring in
the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, work that was banned
after the April 20  BP Plc (BP)  oil spill.  Vitter and Bishop introduced a similar  bill  in the previous
Congress.  -- Editors: Steve Geimann, Larry Liebert  To contact the reporter on this story:
