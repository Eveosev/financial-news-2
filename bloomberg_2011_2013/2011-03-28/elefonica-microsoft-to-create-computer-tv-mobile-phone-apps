Telefonica SA (TEF)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 
will jointly create applications for products including personal
computers, television and mobile phones through Telefonica’s new
BlueVia developer platform.  The alliance aims to combine the telecommunications
capacities of  Europe ’s second-largest phone company with
Microsoft’s expertise in web development and its open cloud
platform, the companies said in a joint statement sent by e-mail
today.  The  BlueVia  software development kit offers developer tools
including Microsoft’s .Net Framework, Silverlight and Visual
Studio 2010. It also includes Windows Azure, which allows users
to create Internet-scale applications without requiring
developers to make an initial investment for infrastructure.  “Our partnership with Microsoft will accelerate BlueVia’s
reach and extend our presence beyond mobile into PC, TV and
gaming platforms,” Vivek Dev, director of global new services
at Telefonica, said in a statement. “Combining our assets will
create applications that bring valuable entertainment and
productivity to 280 million Telefonica customers worldwide.”  A spokeswoman for Telefonica, who declined to be identified
citing company policy, didn’t provide any financial or timeframe
details when contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
