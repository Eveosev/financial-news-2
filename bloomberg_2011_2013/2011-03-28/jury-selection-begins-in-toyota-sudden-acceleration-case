Jury selection has begun in a case
against  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  in which a  Long Island , New York man
claims his 2005 Scion sped up uncontrollably and didn’t stop
until he hit a tree.  Amir Sitafalwalla’s lawsuit, filed in 2008, is the first
sudden acceleration claim against Toyota to reach a jury trial
in the U.S. Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, recalled
millions of U.S. vehicles, starting in 2009, for defects related
to unintended acceleration.  Jury selection started in federal court in Central Islip on
Long Island, New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
