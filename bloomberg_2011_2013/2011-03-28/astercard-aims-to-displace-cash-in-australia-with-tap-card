Australian banks that issue
 MasterCard Inc. (MA)  cards will need to include its PayPass “tap”
technology from October 2012, as the world’s second-biggest
payments network moves to expand use of the cashless system.  By April 2014, all MasterCard merchants in Australia will
also need to have at least one electronic reader that shoppers
tap for transactions of less than A$100 ($102), the Purchase,
New York-based company said today in a statement.  Some 5.3 million PayPass enabled cards have already been
issued in Australia, covering the equivalent of almost one in
four people in one of the few developed economies to skirt the
global recession that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008. The number of PayPass transactions more
than tripled between June and December, MasterCard said.  “We’re trying to displace as much cash as we can,” David
Masters, MasterCard vice president of strategy and corporate
affairs, said in a telephone interview yesterday in Sydney.
“The end aim is to have 100 percent of cards in the Australian
market PayPass enabled.”  MasterCard is today releasing a five-year plan to broaden
the use of its tap cards, which don’t require shoppers to enter
a personal code or provide a signature during transactions. Some
35,000 shops in  Australia  accept PayPass, Masters said.  The plan includes a promise to ensure by October 2012, that
selected categories of merchants, including taxis, newsagents,
 convenience stores , gasoline stations and cinemas, use the
technology.  To contact the reporter for this story:
