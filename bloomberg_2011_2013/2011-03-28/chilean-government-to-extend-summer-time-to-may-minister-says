Chileâ€™s government will extend
summer time by about a month as it seeks ways to save energy
amid a drought that has cut hydroelectricity output, Mining and
Energy Minister  Laurence Golborne  said today.  Chile will roll clocks back an hour in May rather than
April 3 as previously planned, the minister wrote on his Twitter
account. The change is part of a pilot program that will allow
the government to evaluate results for next year, he wrote in
the Tweet, which his press office confirmed as authentic.  The government first changed summer time on March 2 when
Golborne said clocks would roll back on April 3, three weeks
later than originally scheduled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
