European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said inappropriate national policies may
lead to inflation rates that stay above the ECB’s 2 percent
tolerance level.  “Inappropriate national policies can engender the
appearance of excessive competitiveness gaps between members of
the monetary union,” Trichet said in Paris today, according to
the text of his speech published on the ECB’s website. “The
principal symptoms of such gaps are in general substantial
accumulations of divergences between competitiveness indicators
in terms of price and costs. These notably lead to inflation
rates that stay durably above the common definition of  price
stability  in the euro zone.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
