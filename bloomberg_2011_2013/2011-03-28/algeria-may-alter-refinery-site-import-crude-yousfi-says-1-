Algeria  may change the location of
a 15 million-metric-ton refinery planned in the northwestern
province of Tiaret, Oil Minister Youcef Yousfi said.  The refinery would be better suited near the coast for
logistical reasons, including the need for a water source,
Yousfi said today in parliament. The north African country may
import a heavy grade of crude, he said.  “We believe it is better to sell our oil, which is one of
the most expensive in the world, and import heavy oil that is
better for the refining industry,” Yousfi said.  Algeria plans to double its refining capacity to 50 million
tons annually by 2030 from 25 million tons, he said.  Algeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, pumped 1.25 million barrels of crude a day
in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
