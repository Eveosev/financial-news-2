JFE Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s second-
largest steelmaker, expects sales in the first-half starting
April 1 will be higher than the previous six months, aided by
reconstruction after the March 11 earthquake.  Demand from other Asian nations will also compensate for
fewer orders from manufacturers in Japan, Hiroshi Maki, an
official at unit JFE Steel’s coordination and operation planning
department, said today at a briefing in  Tokyo .  Steel shipments at JFE are forecast to reach 13.36 million
metric tons in the six months ending March 31, according to a
Jan. 28 statement from the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
