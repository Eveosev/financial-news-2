Madeco SA (MADECO) , the largest shareholder
in French cable maker  Nexans SA (NEX) , rose to a two-week high in
Santiago trading after agreeing to increase its Nexans stake to
20 percent from 9 percent.  Madeco, a copper-products company controlled by Chile’s
Luksic family, climbed 4 percent to 26.77 pesos, its highest
level since March 15.  “While it all depends on the price, the idea is it’s
returning to a business that it used to handle very well,”
Rodrigo Mujica, an analyst at the brokerage unit of Banco de
Credito & Inversiones, said by phone from Santiago.  Madeco has 18 months to raise its stake to 15 percent, and
a further 18 months to lift its holding to 20 percent, Nexans
Chief Executive Officer Frederic Vincent said on a conference
call today. Madeco will nominate a second Nexans board member at
a shareholders meeting in May, and a third once its stake
reaches 15 percent, the companies said in a statement.  “Madeco will be able to cooperate more actively in the
management of one of the world’s leading cable producers,” the
company wrote in a statement distributed today by e-mail.  Madeco became the single largest shareholder in Nexans in
2007, when it agreed to sell its cable operations to the French
company for 2.5 million new shares and $422 million in cash.  Madeco agreed to increase its stake via purchases in the
market or through a capital increase, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
