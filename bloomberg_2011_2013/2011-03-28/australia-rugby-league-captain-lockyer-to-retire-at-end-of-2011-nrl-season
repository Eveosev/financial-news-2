Australia  rugby league captain
Darren Lockyer will retire at the end of the 2011 National Rugby
League season, ending his record-setting 17-year career at the
sport’s elite level.  Lockyer, who holds the record for the most tries,
appearances and Tests as captain for Australia, said he’s ready
to “move on to the next stage of my life.”  “I know the timing is right,” Lockyer, who turned 34 last
week, said in a statement on the Brisbane Broncos website.  Lockyer has scored 34 tries in 54 Tests for the Kangaroos
and also played 336 NRL games for the Broncos since his debut in
1995, helping the team win four premiership titles. He’s also
played 33 matches for Queensland in Australia’s State of Origin
interstate series.  After playing most of his career at full-back, Lockyer
switched to stand-off in 2004. He’s the only man to have won the
Golden Boot award as the world’s best player twice while playing
in different positions.  Lockyer said he hadn’t decided what he will do at the end
of the season and has no plans as yet to stay involved in rugby
league once he stops playing.  “Of course I will observe the game and watch what is going
on,” he said, “but at this point I am going to take a complete
break from the day-to-day grind of the NRL.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
