China ’s stocks advanced for a
second day after companies from Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. to China
Minsheng Banking Corp. reported higher profit.  Minsheng, the nation’s first non-state lender, jumped the
most since Nov. 3 after profit surged 45 percent. Yanzhou Coal
advanced 5.3 percent to a record after China’s fourth-biggest
producer of the commodity more than doubled net income.
Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Co. paced declines by drugmakers after
the stock’s rating was cut at Huachuang Securities.  “Earnings growth is supporting the rally in the market and
sentiment is turning bullish,” said Tu Jun, a strategist at
Shanghai Securities Co. “Some investors are betting on better-
than-expected earnings for the second quarter as the economy
withstands tightening measures.”  The Shanghai Composite Index gained 6.2, or 0.2 percent, to
2,984.01 at the 3 p.m. close. The gauge has climbed 6.3 percent
this year, the best performance among  Asia ’s biggest equity
markets. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 0.1 percent to 3,290.57.  Policy makers have boosted borrowing costs three times
since the start of 2010 while raising banks’ reserve
requirements nine times, including an increase on March 18.
Annual inflation reached 4.9 percent in February, slowing from a
two-year high of 5.1 percent in November.  China’s inflation may accelerate to 5 percent this month
and first-quarter economic growth may reach 9.9 percent, China
International Capital Corp. said in a report.  ‘Safe Guarantee’  “The earlier measures have started to show effects,
pushing the tightening toward a concluding period,” said Hao Kang, a portfolio manager at ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management
Co., which oversees $9.2 billion as a joint venture between the
largest bank in China and  Switzerland ’s second-largest lender.
“Valuations at bottom levels and companies’ 2010 earnings
provide a safe guarantee for investors,” Hao said.  Companies on the Shanghai Composite trade at 14 times
estimated earnings, compared with about 16 times at the end of
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Minsheng added 2.6 percent to 5.51 yuan. The lender said
net income rose to 17.6 billion yuan ($2.68 billion) from 12.1
billion yuan a year earlier. That exceeded the 15.86 billion
yuan average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Huaxia Bank Co. gained 0.4 percent to 12.54 yuan after
saying net income for 2010 rose 59 percent from a year earlier
to 5.99 billion yuan.  China Construction Bank Corp. (601939) , the world’s second-largest
lender by market value, fell 0.2 percent to 5.03 yuan after
posting profit that missed some analysts’ estimates because of
rising provisions. Beijing-based Construction Bank said
yesterday net income rose 26 percent last year to 134.8 billion
yuan ($20.6 billion). That was less than the 139 billion yuan
average of 17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Coal Producers  An index of energy companies climbed 0.8 percent, the most
among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups.  Yanzhou Coal jumped 5.3 percent to 34.94 yuan, a record-
high. The company said full-year net income more than doubled to
9.3 billion yuan in 2010.  China Shenhua Energy Co., the nation’s largest coal
producer, advanced 1.4 percent to 29.59 yuan after the company
said net income for 2010 rose to 38.1 billion yuan last year on
increasing prices of the fuel.  Chinese industrial companies’ profits jumped 34 percent in
the first two months of the year, underscoring the strength of
the world’s fastest-growing major economy amid higher  interest
rates  and lending curbs.  Profits rose to 645.5 billion yuan from a year earlier, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on its website yesterday.
This is the first survey since the  bureau  changed the annual
sales threshold for companies eligible for inclusion to 20
million yuan from 5 million yuan.  ‘Broadly Bullish’  Chinese stocks and energy companies are expected to lead
advances by Asian equities this year, according to a survey of
participants attending a Credit Suisse Group AG investor
conference in  Hong Kong  last week.  “The general vibe is that actually inflation is not going
to be that much of a worry, that in the second half of the year
inflation concerns are going to wane,” Jahanzeb Naseer, Credit
Suisse Group AG’s Hong Kong-based product manager for Asian
research, said in a phone interview on March 25.  “People are
broadly bullish.”  Citic Securities Co. said in a report today that it’s
“cautious” about China’s stocks in the second quarter as  oil
prices  are likely to stay high and growth may slow in  Europe .  Consumer Shares  ICBC Credit Suisse’s Hao said he reduced holdings in
consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks, citing
valuations and rising raw material prices.  Gauges tracking consumer-related stocks fell. Kweichow
Moutai Co., China’s largest liquor maker by market value, lost
1.4 percent to 180.91 yuan. Wuliangye Yibin Co. declined 2.2
percent to 31.66 yuan. FAW Car Co. slid 1.9 percent to 17.28
yuan.  Guangzhou Pharmaceutical lost 2.9 percent to 20.65 yuan.
The stock’s rating was reduced to "Buy" from "Strong Buy" at
Huachuang Securities by equity analyst Wanguo Liao. The 12-month
target price is 20.65 yuan per share.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
