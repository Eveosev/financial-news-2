Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper will announce today plans for a tax break to families
with children under the age of 18 if he wins the country’s May 2
elections, CTV news reported.  The measure, which will allow individuals within a
household to split their income for tax purposes, won’t be
implemented until the country’s budget returns to balance, CTV
news said, according to a report on the broadcaster’s website.
