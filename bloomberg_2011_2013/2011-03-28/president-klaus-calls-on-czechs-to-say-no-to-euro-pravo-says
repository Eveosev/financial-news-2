The  Czech Republic  should “have
the courage” to say it doesn’t want to adopt the euro as
 Europe ’s monetary union battles a sovereign credit crisis,
President Vaclav Klaus said.  The European Union is moving toward closer fiscal and
political integration and it’s not in the Czech Republic’s
interest to take part in that process, Klaus wrote in an article
posted on his website and published by the Prague-based
newspaper Pravo today.  Klaus, who delayed signing the EU’s Lisbon Treaty in 2009,
asked the government of Prime Minister Petr Necas last year to
look at whether the country may renege on its obligation to make
the currency switch because the economic and monetary union, or
EMU, has changed since the Czech Republic committed to it when
entering the EU in 2004.  “We should, at last, ask ourselves what form of European
integration we want so that every future Czech negotiator has a
clear position,” Klaus said. “We should have the courage to
say that we don’t even want the EMU.”  The euro fell for a second day against the dollar today
after EU leaders agreed to cut the startup capital for a future
emergency-aid mechanism, stoking concern efforts to quell the
debt crisis will be insufficient.  To contact the reporter on this story:
