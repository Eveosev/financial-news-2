Silver forward mid rates moved to
positive from negative last week for the first time since the
beginning of February, indicating that supply may be increasing
versus demand.  The 12-month indicative silver forward mid rate increased
to 0.043 percent on March 24, the first positive figure since
Feb. 3, data compiled by Bloomberg from the  London Bullion
Market Association  show. The rate, the midpoint between bid and
offer sides of a swap between market makers, was at 0.034
percent today.  A positive figure means “that forward rates are at a
premium to spot,” according to the LBMA’s over-the-counter
guide published on its website. “This condition is often
referred to as contango. When there is a shortage of metal
liquidity for leasing, the cost of borrowing metal may exceed
the cost of borrowing dollars. In this scenario, the forward
differential becomes a negative figure.”  Metal can be lent or borrowed against currency, which
participants refer to as lending on the swap or borrowing on the
swap, according to the LMBA.  The 12-month lease rate, the cost of borrowing silver, was
at 0.75 percent today, down from 1.39 percent on Feb. 21, the
data show. Scarcity of metal liquidity can lead to high lease
rates, and an increase in liquidity can lead to lower lease
rates, according to the LBMA.  Silver for immediate delivery traded at $37.17 an ounce as
of 5:08 p.m. in  London . Prices are up 20 percent this year and
reached $38.165 on March 24, the highest level since February
1980.  To contact the reporter on this story:
