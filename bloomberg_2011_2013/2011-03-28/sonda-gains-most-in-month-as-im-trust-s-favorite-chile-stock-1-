Sonda SA (SONDA)  rose the most in three
weeks in Santiago trading after IM Trust SA said the information
technology company is its top pick among Chilean stocks.  Sonda climbed 4 percent to 1,195.6 pesos, the biggest
advance since March 3. Chile’s IPSA index rose 0.1 percent.  Sonda replaced retailer Cencosud SA as the Santiago-based
brokerage’s preferred Chilean stock, IM Trust analysts wrote in
an e-mailed note to clients, citing a $500 million expansion
plan and an “attractive” price of 16.9 times earnings.  “The market has not captured the full extent of its
fundamentals,” the analysts wrote.  IM Trust selected Cencosud in second place and  Banco
Santander Chile (BSAN)  in third. Other top picks include  Lan Airlines
SA (LAN)  and health services provider  Banmedica SA. (BANMED)   To contact the reporter on this story:
