Essar Energy Plc (ESSR) , the operator of
 India ’s second-largest private refinery, has delayed a plan to
halt its plant after calls from government-run companies facing
shortages of petroleum products.  Essar planned to shut the Vadinar unit in western India for
35 days starting in the third week of May, two people with
knowledge of the matter said March 16. The works will be
postponed until September, the company said today in a
statement. This will not affect plans to expand capacity at the
refinery, it said.  The expansion will boost capacity to 375,000 barrels a day
from about 300,000 barrels a day, the company said. The majority
of the increased production is expected to begin operating from
the middle of the fourth quarter of this year, Essar said.  Government-run refiners Bharat Petroleum Corp., Hindustan
Petroleum Corp. and Indian Oil Corp., all Essar’s customers,
asked the company to continue production because of insufficient
supply in  Asia  of oil products such as gasoil or diesel,
according to the statement.  Essar Energy is the London-listed arm of India’s Essar
Group, whose interests include shipping, telecoms and steel. The
group also operates a Mumbai-based unit called  Essar Oil Ltd. (ESOIL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
