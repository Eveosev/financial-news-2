Groupe Lactalis said French law
doesn’t consider the food sector a “strategic” one that should
be protected from foreign control, the company said in an e-
mailed statement this evening. The company said it was
“surprised” at Italian media reporting the “alleged
presence” of such rules, “because no such rules exist,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
