The Australian dollar rose to
almost a record high versus the U.S. currency and  New Zealand ’s
currency reversed yesterday’s loss after commodities erased a
decline, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The kiwi, as the currency is nicknamed, appreciated against
all of its 16 most-traded counterparts after a government report
showed New Zealand’s imports increased by more than economists
forecast. Australia’s dollar gained before reports forecast to
show retail sales climbed in February for a fourth month and
home-building approvals increased.  “The momentum over the next weeks and months can take the
Aussie higher,” said  Imre Speizer , a market strategist in
Auckland at Westpac Banking Corp., Australia’s second-largest
lender. He advised buying dips in both currencies, as they
“have their own strengths based on commodity growth at the
moment.”  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to $1.0259 at 12:14
p.m. in New York, from $1.0244 yesterday. It touched $1.0315
yesterday, the highest level since it began trading freely in
1983. The Aussie gained 1 percent to 84.55 yen, from 83.69 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.6 percent to 75.55 U.S.
cents, from 75.13 cents yesterday, when it declined 0.3 percent.
The currency climbed 1.5 percent to 62.26 yen, from 61.37 yen.  The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of  raw materials  erased a
0.7 percent loss today. Raw materials make up a majority of New
Zealand’s and Australia’s exports. Crude oil for May delivery
rose 0.5 percent to $104.48 a barrel in New York, after earlier
falling as much as 1.2 percent to $102.70 a barrel.  Trade Surplus   New Zealand posted its first trade surplus in eight months
in February on record-high commodity prices, while imports grew
more than forecast. The nation’s exports outpaced imports by
NZ$194 million ($146 million),  Statistics New Zealand  said
today. Overseas shipments, which make up 30 percent of gross
domestic product, rose 17 percent from a year earlier to a nine-
month high of NZ$3.87 billion, compared with a forecast for
NZ$3.5 billion.  Australian retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month, and
the number of permits granted to build or renovate houses and
apartments advanced 4 percent, after a 15.9 percent drop in the
previous month, according to the median forecasts of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The Bureau of Statistics will
release the data at 8:30 p.m.  New York  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
