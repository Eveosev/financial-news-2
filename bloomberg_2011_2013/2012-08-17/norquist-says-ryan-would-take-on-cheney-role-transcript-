Anti-tax advocate  Grover Norquist 
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political
Capital With  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that Republican
vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan would influence economic
and tax policy if Mitt Romney wins the White House much the way
former Vice President Dick Cheney helped guide national security
matters during  George W. Bush ’s administration.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with the president of the
Americans for  Tax Reform  and author of “The Taxpayer Protection
Pledge,” Grover Norquist. Thank you for being with us, Grover.
You were -  GROVER NORQUIST: Sure.  HUNT: - pleased about the selection of  Mitt Romney ’s
running mate. Let me ask you this. What do you find more
appealing - because there are at least a few differences - the
Romney or the Ryan economic budget blueprint?  NORQUIST: The advantage of the Ryan plan is that it’s been
scored by CBO, it’s been written down. The entire Republican
caucus in the House and Senate has vetted it, can speak to it,
has voted for it once, so it’s sort of been through the process.  HUNT: Right.  NORQUIST: The presidential candidate, Romney’s, proposal is
a fine one, 20 percent across the board. I think what we’ll get
is something like what  Jack Kemp  and  Ronald Reagan  had in 1978
to ’81, which was Reagan endorsed Kemp-Roth, and then the final
package was the Reagan  tax cut , but it was built around the idea
-  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: So you would expect Romney to basically embrace Ryan,
and it’ll be the Romney tax cut?  NORQUIST: With rough edges taken off and changes here and
there.  HUNT: Do you worry that Mitt Romney is distancing himself a
little bit over the last four or five days from Paul Ryan’s
budget?  NORQUIST: Well, I think quite correctly, if you’re running
for president, you want to say this is what we’re looking to do,
but to get nailed down to - I mean, the bill’s quite long, it’s
quite detailed, is there something in there that -  HUNT: So that’s proper?  NORQUIST: - that he would not want to buy into? Possibly.  HUNT: OK.  NORQUIST: But the thrust, he’s made it clear. He’s - he’s
for moving in that direction.  HUNT: Let me ask you this. There’s a debate among some
people who know Romney well, how would he govern if elected
president, the rather pragmatic, solutions-oriented governor of
 Massachusetts , or the conservative candidate for president? Do
you feel that  Paul Ryan , as the vice president, would be more
likely to deter any impulses to get wobbly if he’s -  NORQUIST: Well, I would argue the difference in
Massachusetts, he was governor for four years. During the entire
four years, the Democrats in the House and the Senate in the
Massachusetts legislature had more than 80 percent of the seats.
So when he was -  HUNT: So it’s not analogous to -  NORQUIST: No, because he was playing defense. He was a
goalie. The other team took shots on goal all day.  HUNT: You don’t think he needs someone like Paul Ryan there
to stop him from -  NORQUIST: No.  HUNT: - or argue strongly against going for compromise?  NORQUIST: No. When - when you’re playing defense and you’re
- you’re the goalie, the best you can do is stop shots on goal
and come to some accommodation, because you have to have a
budget. He’s going to get elected with a Republican House and
Senate and be able to move forward an agenda as opposed to play
defense.  HUNT: Do you have any sense that Paul Ryan, given his
experience and expertise in the economic area, would be a
domestic economic equivalent in the Romney - Romney
administration, say, to  Dick Cheney  on national security in the
 Bush administration ?  NORQUIST: Absent Gitmo, yes. I think that he would
certainly have a large footprint. I was actually publicly an
advocate of not having Ryan be the vice presidential nominee,
not because I don’t think Ryan’s key or important, but because I
think he’s so key and important.  HUNT: But you were still pleased with the pick? I mean
(inaudible)  NORQUIST: Oh, yes. No, no, I wanted him to stay in the
House and run the Romney-Ryan plan through the House and the
Senate, because I thought that was so important. So -  HUNT: But you see - let me make sure I’m right on this. You
see him as playing - again, we’re talking on economics and
taxes, not national security -  NORQUIST: Yeah.  HUNT: - as playing the sort of role in that area that
Cheney did in the Bush 43?  NORQUIST: Similar, although, remember, Cheney designed the
’83 tax cut, too, and that was -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: But that wasn’t -  (CROSSTALK)  NORQUIST: - Cheney put together -  (CROSSTALK)  NORQUIST: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I misspoke, 2003. The 2003
tax cut was Cheney’s (inaudible)  HUNT: Yeah. Let me - you have always had an interest in the
 Middle East . What did you think of Governor Romney’s comment
when he was in  Israel  that the Israelis are economically
superior to the Palestinians because of cultural differences?  NORQUIST: Well, I think he was doing several things, and he
mixed up a couple of different books. He talked about “Guns,
Germs and Steel,” which has actually the opposite case, so I’m
not quite sure how he put those together. What happens is policy
matters, property rights matters. If you want to know countries
that succeed, they have property rights and rule of law. That’s
one thing that you don’t have in the countries surrounding
Israel and that is denied to the Palestinians.  So it was an odd place to make that case. If you wanted to
argue that property rights matter and rule of law matters, yes.
I don’t know if that’s culture. I mean, go back 20 years, the
Israeli economy pre-Netanyahu’s economic reforms was not doing
very well. The culture didn’t change. The  tax code  changed, and
the regulatory base changed, and the rule of law changed -  HUNT: OK.  NORQUIST: - and got better in Israel.  HUNT: You have a lot of members, the vast majority of
Republican members of Congress who have signed your tax pledge.
But the other day, the  American Enterprise Institute , a
cathedral of conservativism in this town for some at least,
wrote that many Republicans, particularly those pro-defense
Republicans, are, quote, “tuning Grover Norquist out.”  NORQUIST: AEI said this?  HUNT: AEI, yeah, on their website.  NORQUIST: Oh, somebody at AEI said this.  HUNT: Yeah. Yeah.  NORQUIST: OK. One, they’re wrong. And, two, there was an
effort by a couple of people to say, let’s raise taxes to avoid
the sequester. Here’s the challenge with that. Were you to raise
taxes to try and buy more spending for national defense, the
Democrats would insist that you have to buy them $2 worth of
social welfare programs for every dollar you got on defense.  HUNT: So that’s just a tradeoff that you say is absolutely
unacceptable?  NORQUIST: Well, it’s not necessarily for me to say it’s
unacceptable. The House and the Senate find it unacceptable. But
more importantly, the leadership in the House and the Senate
that wants tax reform realizes that if you go in and take
deductions and credits and give them to the appropriators,
they’re not available to the tax writers at Ways and Means and
Finance to reduce marginal tax rates.  HUNT: Grover, you - one of the people who signed your
pledge is  Lindsey Graham , who said the other day that we have to
raise revenues by closing loopholes or raising fees. And then on
his old pledge, he said I’ve crossed that Rubicon.  NORQUIST: I had a conversation with him about that, because
I was saying, what were you thinking? And he has this imaginary
unicorn that he hopes to reach, and that is the Democrats giving
him trillions of dollars of - in a lockbox - trillions of
dollars of entitlement reforms, less spending, in which case
he’d trade a teeny tax increase for that. I suggested that
that’s not - does not exist in the real world. It is like
unicorn in that. And he said you may be right.  So if he wants to go out and look for unicorns, he can have
that conversation. But he’s - he’s going to be lonely out there,
because there are no Democrats and no Republicans in that zone.  HUNT: Do you think that any - any  budget deficit  deal early
next year, with a Republican administration, will include no net
revenue increases?  NORQUIST: Correct. And, remember, that’s what happened two
years ago, after the Republicans won the House, not the Senate
and not the presidency. They just had the House. Democrats came
in and continued all the Bush tax cuts, plus AMT reform and the
other - the patch and so on.  HUNT: So let me just go - you think there will be a deal
next year, some kind of budget?  NORQUIST: There will be a budget.  HUNT: There will be a - there will be a budget deficit and
a long-term deficit reduction deal -  NORQUIST: It’ll look like the Ryan plan. It will not have a
tax increase in it.  HUNT: If Obama should win a narrow re-election, what would
the budget fight look like next year?  NORQUIST: Look an awful lot like what it did for the last
two years, which is a Republican House and, I believe, a Senate
saying we’re not going to raise your taxes and we’re not letting
you spend the money you want to spend.  HUNT: OK, Grover Norquist, thank you so much for being with
us. You have been called the most powerful man in  Washington ,
even more powerful than Bryce Harper, but he is in a hitting
slump, I’d have to point out, Grover.  NORQUIST: And we’ve stopped every tax increase.  HUNT: Hey, thank you very, very much. And when we return,
Paul Ryan enters the fray. Bloomberg reporters are next.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
