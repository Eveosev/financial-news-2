Clearwater Paper Corp. (CLW)  should
separate the company’s tissue and pulp units for a possible
sale, SAC Capital Advisors LP, the hedge fund run by  Steven Cohen , said.  Clearwater should separate the  consumer products  unit,
which makes tissue, from the pulp and paperboard unit so that it
can sell one or both of the businesses,  Stamford , Connecticut-
based SAC said today in a regulatory filing. SAC also proposed
that Spokane, Washington-based Clearwater hire an investment
bank to advise on divestitures and add two independent directors
to the six-member board.  SAC told Clearwater’s board in a May 1 letter that the
stock is “deeply undervalued,” partly because litigation and a
tissue acquisition were causing uncertainty. Clearwater is worth
$43 to $67 a share when the two businesses are evaluated
separately, SAC said in the letter. SAC holds 1.64 million
Clearwater shares representing 7.1 percent of outstanding stock,
it said.  Matt Van Vleet, a Clearwater spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a phone message seeking comment after regular business
hours.  Clearwater rose 0.4 percent to $36.66 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
