Taiwan ’s dollar completed a weekly
loss as data showed the gross domestic product shrank more than
estimated and the government cut its economic estimates.  The currency and local stocks erased gains today as the
statistics bureau reported that GDP contracted 0.18 percent in
the three months through June from a year earlier, compared with
a July 31 estimate for a 0.16 percent drop. The island’s economy
will expand 1.66 percent this year, the bureau forecast today,
compared with an earlier projection of 2.08 percent.  “The authorities will want to help the exporters by
keeping the  Taiwan dollar  on a depreciation bias,” said  James
Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei.  Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.1 percent this week to NT$30.025
against its U.S. counterpart, the lowest level since Aug. 13,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.40 percent
from a week ago.  Exports may shrink 1.72 percent this year, compared with an
earlier forecast for a 0.07 percent gain, the statistics bureau
said. Orders for shipments probably fell 2.98 percent in July
from a year earlier, versus a 2.62 percent drop in June,
according to a Bloomberg survey before data due Aug. 20.  Global funds bought $789 million more Taiwanese shares than
they sold this week through yesterday, compared with $1.7
billion last week.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 was
little changed at 1.182 percent versus 1.177 percent on Aug. 10,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight money-
market rate  was steady at 0.386 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
