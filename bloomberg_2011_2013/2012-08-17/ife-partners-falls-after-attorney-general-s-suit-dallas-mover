Life Partners Holdings Inc. (LPHI)  fell in
New York trading after Texas Attorney General  Greg Abbott  sued
the company for allegedly selling unregistered securities.  Life Partners, which buys rights to life insurance death
benefits and sells them to investors, plunged 6.7 percent to
$2.22 at 9:59 a.m. in New York. The Waco, Texas-based company
has dropped about 66 percent this year.  A hearing was scheduled for today in state court in Austin
after Abbott sought a court order barring Life Partners, Chief
Executive Officer Brian D. Pardo and President R. Scott Peden
from continuing to sell the allegedly fraudulent Securities. The
attorney general is also seeking to appoint a receiver.  “We deny the allegations in the strongest possible
terms,” Pardo said in a statement issued by Life Partners
Holdings late yesterday. He also said Texas courts and a federal
appeals court had reviewed the companies’ life settlements and
ruled they are not securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
