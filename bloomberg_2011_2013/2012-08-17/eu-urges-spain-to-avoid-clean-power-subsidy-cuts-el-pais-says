European Commissioner for Energy
Gunther Oettinger urged  Spain  not to impose retroactive cuts to
subsidies for clean energy, El Pais reported.  “Any measures taken in the Spanish  energy industry  should
be neutral from a technological point of view and should not
create an unfavorable treatment for renewables,” the newspaper
cited Oettinger as saying in a letter to the renewable energy
industry association.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
