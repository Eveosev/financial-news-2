European gasoline fell from a four-
month high as  Brent crude  declined. The motor fuel’s crack, or
premium to the crude benchmark, decreased.  Egyptian General Petroleum Corp., the state-owned  oil
company , issued a tender to buy 18 gasoil cargoes from October
through December, according to two traders with knowledge of the
matter.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $1,106 and $1,110 a metric ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with $1,114 yesterday.  The trades are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added
to make finished fuel. Barge deals are typically for lots of
1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  premium  to Brent fell to $13.82 a barrel as of
10:40 a.m. local time from $14.31 yesterday, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in  London .  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent widened to $7.61 a barrel from
$7.09 in the previous session, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for delivery in September rose $1.25, or 0.1
percent, to $978.50 a ton as of 12:57 p.m. local time on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London. The more actively traded
October contract was at $977.75 a ton.  That takes the market into backwardation for the first time
since Aug. 10, a structure where near-term supplies are more
expensive than later-dated deliveries that can signal near-term
scarcity of supply or an increase in demand.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability, jumped
to $17.45 a barrel from $15.19 at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent
dropped 1.3 percent to $113.78 a barrel.  Tenders  EGPC, as the Egyptian company is known, is seeking to
purchase four cargoes a month of gasoil for delivery to
Alexandria and two a month to El Dekheila, each of 30,000 tons,
the traders said on condition of anonymity. A phone call to
EGPC’s Cairo office today, which is not a business day in  Egypt ,
wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
