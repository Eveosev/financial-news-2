The Texas Rangers escaped a series
sweep by the American League-leading New York Yankees last night,
winning the last of the four Major League Baseball games 10-6.  The Rangers lost a 4-0 lead when the Yankees answered with
five runs in the sixth inning. David Murphy tied the game with a
run-scoring double and Craig Gentry added a two-run single in
the seventh to put Texas up 7-5 at Yankee Stadium.  Elvis Andrus scored on Adrian Beltre’s sacrifice fly and
Josh Hamilton reached home on Geovany Soto’s single in the
eighth inning.  Nelson Cruz  added a 10th run for the Rangers on a
single by Andrus in the ninth.  “I don’t know about putting up 10 runs every night,”
Rangers manager  Ron Washington  told reporters. “It’s certainly
the offense I expect to see most nights.”  Mark Teixeira  scored  Raul Ibanez  on a fielder’s choice
ground out to shortstop in the bottom of the seventh to bring
the Yankees within one run.  Tanner Scheppers (1-0) allowed one run on two hits in one-
third innings for the win. Boone Logan (4-1) took the loss,
surrendering two runs on two hits in 1/3 inning for the Yankees.  “It’s going to happen,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  told
reporters. “Our guys aren’t going to be perfect out there.”  The Yankees (70-48) have a six-game lead in the American
League East, and the Rangers (68-49) lead the AL West by the
same margin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
