European Union carbon allowances
rose for a third week, even as German electricity was unchanged
and the nation’s Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said the EU
should avoid intervention in the emissions market.  EU permits for delivery in December closed at 7.71 euros
($9.50) on London’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange, unchanged today
and 6.9 percent higher in the week.  German electricity for 2013 fell 0.2 percent today to 49.50
euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. Cheaper prices can curb the incentive to sell
electricity forward, lowering demand for carbon permits.  Politicians in Europe should not interfere with the
emissions market, Roesler told reporters in Warsaw today,
commenting on a plan to delay some auctions of carbon permits to
bolster prices.  United Nations carbon offsets for 2013 fell 0.3 percent to
2.90 euros a ton at 5:47 p.m. in London, a decline of 1 percent
in the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
