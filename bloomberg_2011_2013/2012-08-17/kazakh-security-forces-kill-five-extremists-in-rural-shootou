Kazakh security forces killed nine
people suspected of planning terror attacks in a shootout in the
Almaty region, the Prosecutor General’s Office said.  The suspects opened fire after refusing to surrender to a
special-forces unit that located them in the countryside, the
Astana-based prosecutor’s office said today in a statement. One
officer was wounded in the attack.  Kazakh security forces suspect the extremists were involved
in a bomb blast in the Almaty region in July 11. The authorities
are identifying the bodies, according to the statement.  President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  last month said the
population of  Kazakhstan , the second-largest former Soviet
republic, is growing “angry” at  law enforcement  for failing to
keep extremists in check.  “Radical elements are exerting severe pressure on the
state and society as a whole,” Nazarbayev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
