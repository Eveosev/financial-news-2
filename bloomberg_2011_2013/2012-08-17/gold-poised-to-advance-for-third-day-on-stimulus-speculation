Gold is set to gain for a third day,
paring a weekly loss, on speculation governments from  China  to
U.S. may take steps to spur growth. Platinum rose to a five-week
high after production disruptions at a mine in South Africa.  Gold for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.2 percent to
$1,618.52 an ounce and was at $1,617.90 at 2:48 p.m. in
 Singapore . The price is down 0.1 percent this week. December-
delivery bullion was little changed at $1,620.10 on the Comex in
New York.  While U.S. housing  permits  rose to the highest since August
2008, jobless claims climbed by 2,000 to 366,000 in the week
ended Aug. 11, reports showed yesterday. Unemployment has been
above 8 percent since February 2009, the longest stretch in the
post-World War II era. Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said Aug. 15
that there’s “growing room for monetary policy operation.”
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may talk about monetary
options at a conference in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, at the end of
the month.  “The U.S. economic recovery is still fairly opaque,” said
 Gavin Wendt , founder and senior resource analyst at Mine Life
Pty in Sydney. “There isn’t a lot of growth. We’ve seen some
bright spots but sometimes they turn into dark spots the next
time the data comes out.”  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said the  European Central
Bank ’s insistence on conditionality in return for helping lower
borrowing costs for indebted countries matches her priorities.  Holdings in exchange-traded products were little changed at
2,416.7 metric tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Lonmin Strike  Spot platinum gained as much as 0.6 percent to $1,450 an
ounce, the highest since July 10, before trading at $1,449.50.
The metal rallied 3.3 percent yesterday amid disruptions at the
mine owned by Lonmin Plc, the third-biggest producer.  More than 30 workers were killed and several others injured
after police shot striking miners near Lonmin’s Marikana
platinum-mining complex in  South Africa  yesterday as violence at
the mine escalated, Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa said in an
interview with Johannesburg-based 702 Talk Radio today. A six-
day work stoppage had already led to deaths of 10 people before
yesterday’s clash.  Platinum, used to make autocatalysts and jewelry, is set to
climb 3.2 percent this week, the biggest gain since the five
days ended June 15.  Spot silver declined as much as 0.3 percent to $28.1388 an
ounce and was at $28.2425. The metal is heading for a 0.4
percent gain this week. Palladium climbed as much as 0.9 percent
to $589.50 an ounce and was last at $589.  To contact the reporter for this story:
