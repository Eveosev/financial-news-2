Mark Thompson , hired as the  New York 
Times Co.’s chief executive officer this week, will receive a
pay package totaling as much as $10.5 million, including an
annual salary of $1 million.  Thompson, who served as the British Broadcasting Corp.’s
director general, stands to make as much as $4.5 million from
his signing bonus, $2 million in annual incentives and $3
million in long-term incentives.  Times Co., the 161-year-old publisher based in New York, is
counting on Thompson to revive sales growth and accelerate a
shift to the Internet. So far, online advertising and a new so-
called paywall on the website haven’t been enough to offset
years of shrinking print revenue.  The new package represents a pay bump for Thompson, 55, who
received  622,000 pounds  ($976,000) in total compensation for his
most recent year at the  BBC . Under his leadership, the
commercial-free network eliminated jobs and moved some offices
and production outside London to save money. The BBC has
undergone spending cuts of more than 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion) since 2008.  Times Co. (NYT) ’s union workers had expressed discontent over the
exit package offered to its previous CEO, Janet Robinson. She
received $23 million, on top of her $1 million base salary. The
compensation included $4.5 million in consulting fees. Chairman
Arthur Sulzberger Jr. has served as interim CEO since Robinson
left in December.  Union Talks  The publisher still faces contentious negotiations with the
 Newspaper Guild  of New York, which represents almost 1,100
employees at the  Times newspaper . Employees have been working
without a contract for more than a year.  Thompson will get $1.5 million of his signing bonus as a
stock award based on his performance between December 2012 and
November 2015, Times Co. said in the filing. Depending on what
he achieves, he could earn 200 percent of that bonus, or $3
million. The remaining $1.5 million of the bonus will be granted
in the form of  stock options .  Times Co. shares  rose less than 1 percent to $9.40 at the
close in New York. The stock has climbed 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
