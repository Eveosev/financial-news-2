Australia ’s average vacancy rate
fell slightly in July, keeping the number of homes available for
rent below 3 percent across the nation’s eight state capitals,
according to  SQM Research Pty.   The vacancy rate fell to 1.9 percent from 2 percent a month
earlier, SQM said in an e-mailed release. Melbourne had the
highest vacancy rate at 2.9 percent, and Darwin the lowest at
0.4 percent, showing signs of a “severe rental crisis,” it
said.  “The rental vacancy market remains steady as it has been
for the course of this year, with the market overall favoring
landlords,” SQM Managing Director Louis Christophersaid in the
release.  Rental yields across Australia’s biggest cities remained at
4.2 percent for houses and 4.9 percent for apartments in July,
according to figures from Brisbane-based researcher RP Data. The
gross rental yield was 5.7 percent for houses and 5.9 percent
for apartments in Darwin, the highest in the country.  Melbourne 
had the lowest yields, at 3.6 percent for houses and 4.4 percent
for apartments, RP Data said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
