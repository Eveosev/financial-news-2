Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V)  and  Stora Enso Oyj (STERV) 
will not progress plans to build a Finnish renewable diesel
plant that would have cost more than 500 million euros ($615
million) after it missed out on European Commission funding.  Neste Oil and paper and packaging company Stora Enso had
planned to build a commercial biodiesel plant to make biowax,
suitable for refining into renewable diesel, Lauri Peltola, a
spokesman for Helsinki-based Stora Enso, said today by phone.  The companies applied for funding under a European Union
program to finance renewable energy technologies and  carbon
capture  and storage projects. The venture was not included in a
document published by the European Commission listing the
projects selected as candidates for NER 300 funds, generated
from the sale of allowances to emit carbon dioxide.  “It would have represented a very significant investment
and we concluded that we would not have gone ahead in any case,
even if we had won public funding,” Matti Lievonen, chief
executive officer at Neste, and Jouko Karvinen, CEO at Stora
Enso, were both quoted as saying in a  statement  on Espoo-based
Neste Oil’s website.  The project, with potential locations at Porvoo or Imatra,
would have produced about 200,000 metric tons of renewable fuel
from wood biomass a year. Trials at a pilot plant in Varkaus to
make biowax were successful and the companies will continue
working together on other products, according to Neste Oil.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
