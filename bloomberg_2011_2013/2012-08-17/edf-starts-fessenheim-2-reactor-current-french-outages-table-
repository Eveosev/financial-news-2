Electricite de  France  SA started its
Fessenheim-2 nuclear power plant today and its Gravelines-1 unit
yesterday, French grid operator Reseau de Transport
d’Electricite said on its website.  The world’s biggest nuclear power plant operator has 39
French reactors online, representing 67 percent of the country’s
available nuclear capacity, RTE data show. EDF’s 58 atomic
plants generate about 78 percent of France’s power.  The table below lists EDF’s nuclear units that are out of
 service , their generating capacity in megawatts, when they
