President Francois Hollande must act
quickly to cut payroll taxes and improve the pension system to
boost France’s credibility in talks with Germany about the
future of the euro, a former adviser said.  “For France, it’s important to gain credibility by
engaging in structural reform,” Philippe Aghion, who advised
Hollande during his election campaign and is a professor at
 Harvard University , said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview from  Stockholm .  The remarks highlight the challenge facing Hollande as he
returns from his summer break next week after three quarters in
which growth in Europe’s second-largest economy has stalled.
Hollande is scheduled to meet with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  on Aug. 23 in Berlin to discuss the next step in tackling
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “Payroll taxes should be transfered to the health tax, the
CSG,” Aghion said. “That needs to be done very quickly.
Administrative costs and the health system and the retirement
system need to be further reformed. I very much hope they will
do it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
