Nine residents of St. Petersburg,
 Russia ’s second-largest city, filed a 333 million-ruble ($10.4
million) lawsuit against pop-star Madonna for violating cultural
traditions during an Aug. 9 concert.  The Moskovsky district court registered a lawsuit against
the U.S. singer, concert organizer PMI Corp. and the
Peterburgsky Sports and Concert Complex, where the show was
held, said Alexandr Pochuev, an attorney for the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs are members of the Trade Union of Russian
Citizens and Narodny Sobor, Pochuev said in a phone interview.
Some were at Madonna’s concert, while others found out about it
from media reports and have a video record of parts of the show,
said Pochuev. A hearing date has not been set.  St. Petersburg  Legislative Assembly member Vitaly Milonov
said in an Aug. 10 interview that Madonna may have broken a law
that forbids propagating homosexuality during her concert in and
should be prosecuted. He said 12-year-old children attended the
show,“which was full of sexual scenes.”  Madonna concert tickets informed holders that children
under 18 were banned, PMI President Evgeny Finkelstein said on
Aug. 10. No laws were broken during the show and the company is
ready to defend its rights in court, said PMI spokeswoman Olga
Lototskaya.  Madonna’s spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg didn’t immediately
reply to an e-mailed message seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
