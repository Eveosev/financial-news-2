Asian currencies had their first
weekly drop in more than a month on concern regional exports
will falter as  China  refrains from adding to measures that
support growth in the region’s biggest economy.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index lost 0.3 percent
in the past five days after data showed China’s  imports  rose the
least in three months in July.  India ,  South Korea , Indonesia and
Taiwan all reported this month that their overseas shipments
fell. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said there’s “growing room for
monetary-policy operations,” during a visit to the eastern
province of Zhejiang, Chinese state television reported this
week. The yuan weakened 1 percent this year.  “There was disappointment that China didn’t do a
stimulus,” said  Vishnu Varathan , an economist at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “There’s also a sense China
wouldn’t allow a fast pace of appreciation with its currency,
which means Asian currencies have less room to rise.”  The Philippine peso weakened 1.3 percent this week to
42.420 per dollar in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
India’s rupee slid 0.8 percent to 55.7450, Malaysia’s ringgit
fell 0.4 percent to 3.1323 and South Korea’s won lost 0.3
percent to 1,134.25. The  yuan  was little changed at 6.3585.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the yuan’s reference
rate to 6.3495 per dollar yesterday, the weakest level since
Nov. 29. Yuan positions at Chinese lenders accumulated from
foreign-exchange purchases stood at 25.658 trillion yuan ($4
trillion) at the end of July, down from 25.661 trillion yuan in
June, PBOC data showed on Aug. 14.  Chinese Exports  Chinese  exports  grew 1 percent in July from a year earlier,
the smallest gain since a decline in January, figures released
on Aug. 10 showed, spurring speculation the nation will act to
revive growth.  The Philippine currency completed its biggest weekly slide
since May as central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said on Aug.
14 a slowdown in  China’s economy  may hurt overseas sales. China
is the Philippines’ largest export market after Japan and the
U.S.  The peso touched 42.43 per dollar yesterday, the weakest
level since June 29, after growth in remittances slowed. Funds
sent home by Filipinos living abroad rose 4.2 percent in June
from a year earlier, the least in 15 months, the central bank
reported on Aug. 15. The peso has gained 3.3 percent this year,
the second-best performance among Asia’s 11 most-active
currencies.  The rupee touched a two-week low after Director General of
Foreign Trade Anup Pujari said on Aug. 14 that merchandise
shipments from India declined 14.8 percent to $22.4 billion last
month, leaving a trade deficit of $15.5 billion. The currency
completed the biggest weekly drop since June this week.  Indian Inflation  The rupee is also weakening on concern the fastest
inflation among the largest  emerging markets  leaves little room
for policy measures to stimulate growth, according to Mumbai-
based brokerage Edelweiss Financial Advisors Ltd.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said this
week that high  inflation  has reduced room for policy measures to
spur the nation’s economic growth. A government report on Aug.
14 showed wholesale prices rose 6.87 percent in July from a year
earlier, after gaining 7.25 percent in June. Inflation was 5.2
percent in Brazil, 1.8 percent in China and 5.6 percent in
Russia last month, according to official figures.  Thailand ’s baht completed a weekly loss as official figures
next week will probably show exports fell for a second month in
July amid Europe’s debt crisis, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. The baht dropped 0.1 percent since Aug. 10
to 31.52 per dollar.  Thai GDP  Gross domestic product rose 3.1 percent last quarter from a
year earlier, the most since the third quarter of 2011, a
separate survey showed before data due on Aug. 20.  “Thailand is still benefiting from the rehabilitation
process from last year’s floods, which is supporting domestic
demand,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center
for  Economic Research  in  Tokyo . “But I don’t expect a one-way
sharp appreciation in the baht as external demand is weak
because of Europe’s debt crisis, and exports may continue to be
sluggish.”  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar slipped 0.1 percent this week to
NT$30.025, while Indonesia’s rupiah closed at 9,494 yesterday,
compared with 9,492 on Aug. 10. Vietnam’s dong was little
changed at 20,845.  To contact the reporter on this story:
