Baltika AS (BLT1T) , the third-biggest listed
Baltic clothing company, rose in Tallinn trading to its highest
level in 12 months after posting a quarterly profit.  The stock rose as much as 10 percent to 63 euro cents,
after gaining 8.1 percent yesterday when Baltika said it made a
profit in the second quarter, its first since 2008. Tallinn-
based Baltika’s stock has more than doubled this year, compared
with a 28 percent gain for its east European peers, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company reported second-quarter net income of 572,000
euros ($702,000), compared with a loss of 444,000 euros a year
earlier, citing closure of unprofitable stores and a larger
selection of brands.  The company, whose rivals include Vilnius-based  Apranga
PVA (APG1L) , said this month it borrowed 3 million euros from a unit of
 Swedbank AB. (SWEDA)  It’s renovating existing stores and plans to open
20 more.  To contact the reporter on this story:
