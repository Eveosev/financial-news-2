India ’s rupee completed the biggest
weekly drop since June on concern gains in crude prices will
widen the current-account deficit of the nation that imports
about 80 percent of its oil.  Brent futures jumped 8.4 percent this month, after climbing
7.3 percent in July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
recent rise in fuel costs is an inflation risk, Subir Gokarn, a
deputy governor at the central bank, said yesterday.  “The sharp increase in crude prices will increase demand
for dollars and pressure the current-account deficit,” said
Krishnamurthy Harihar, a Mumbai-based treasurer at  FirstRand
Ltd. (FSR)  “High inflation will also deter foreign fund inflows.”  The rupee declined 0.8 percent this week to 55.7450 per
dollar in Mumbai, the biggest drop since the five-day period
ended June 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency was little changed today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose 20 basis points, or 0.20
percentage point, this week to 10.40 percent. It was little
changed today.  The shortfall in the current  account , the broadest measure
of trade, widened to a record 4.2 percent of gross domestic
product in the year through March 2012 from 2.7 percent in the
previous 12 months, according to the  Reserve Bank  of India.  India’s  benchmark price  index rose 6.87 percent in July
from a year earlier, after gaining 7.25 percent in June,
according to official data published this week. That compares
with 5.2 percent in Brazil, 1.8 percent in  China  and 5.6 percent
in  Russia .  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.75 per
dollar, compared with 56.37 on Aug. 10, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.70 from 56.25 a week earlier.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
