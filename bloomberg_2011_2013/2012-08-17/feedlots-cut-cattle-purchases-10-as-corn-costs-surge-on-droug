U.S. feedlots bought 10 percent
fewer young cattle in July as feed costs climbed after the most
severe drought in 56 years scorched grain crops.  Feedlots bought 1.922 million head of cattle last month,
down from a record 2.135 million in July 2011, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Ten analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 9.1 percent drop, on
average. The feedlot herd totaled 10.656 million head as of Aug.
1, up 0.7 percent from a year earlier. Analysts expected a 0.8
percent increase.  The price of corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed,
surged 60 percent from June 15 through yesterday on the Chicago
Board of Trade as a widespread drought dimmed harvest prospects.
Feedlots probably lost about $200 a head on cattle sold in July
because of high feed costs,  Rich Nelson , the director of
research for Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois , said in a
telephone interview before the report. Feedlot purchases in July
2011 were the highest for the month since the government began
tracking the data in 1996.  ‘Tough Comparison’  “With that tough comparison, this year’s July placement
was certain to be lower,” Nelson said in an e-mailed report.
“Significant losses on outgoing cattle from feedlots in July
provided further reason for buying fewer new calves and
feeders.”  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened on corn for about four to five months until they
weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  More than half of the Midwest was in  “severe”  drought as
of Aug. 14, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. While
purchases were down from 2011, they were still “tremendously
large” as the drought spurred producers to move animals off
pastures, Nelson said.  Feedlots sold about 1.913 million animals to meatpackers
last month, down 0.3 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected a 1.2 percent gain, on average.  Fattened cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.1
percent to $1.25675 a pound at 11:37 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price was up 3.4 percent in 2012
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement were little
changed at $1.44075 a pound. Before today, the commodity dropped
3.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
