Light  Louisiana  Sweet oil weakened
to the smallest premium to the U.S. benchmark in more than three
weeks after the Obama administration said a release from the
nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve is possible.  A release from reserves remains “an option that is on the
table” if prices rise or supply is disrupted,  Josh Earnest , a
White House spokesman, said. No decision has been made and he
refused to say if there is active discussion about the reserve.  A release from the inventories, which are stored in salt
caverns in Texas and Louisiana, could suppress regional and
Brent prices, said John Shages, who was deputy assistant energy
secretary for petroleum reserves in President  George W. Bush ’s
administration. The  reserves  held 262 million barrels sweet oil
and 433.9 million barrels of sour oil as of Aug. 3.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
narrowed $1.90 to $16.50 a barrel at 2:02 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the smallest gap
since July 23. Heavy Louisiana Sweet decreased $1.60 to $16.40
over WTI.  Poseidon  premium  slipped $1.60 to a $12.65 premium. Mars
Blend decreased $1.40 to $12.65 a barrel over WTI. Southern
Green Canyon’s premium narrowed $1.75 to $11.25.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, decreased $1.50 to a
premium of $15.25.  Syncrude’s premium increased 25 cents to $8.50 a barrel.
Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed by $3.75 to
$11.75 a barrel.  Bakken oil from  North Dakota  lost $1 to a $1-a-barrel
discount to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
