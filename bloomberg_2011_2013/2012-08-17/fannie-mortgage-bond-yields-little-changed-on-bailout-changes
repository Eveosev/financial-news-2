Relative yields on  Fannie Mae  and
Freddie Mac mortgage securities that guide home-loan rates were
little changed as the Treasury Department said it would alter
their bailout agreements, while spreads on the companies’
corporate debt narrowed.  A Bloomberg index of yields on Fannie Mae-guaranteed
mortgage bonds trading closest to face value was unchanged at
1.31 percentage points higher than an average of five- and 10-
year Treasury rates as of 9:54 a.m. in New York, the widest in a
month. Spreads on its unsecured notes due in August 2017 fell
0.05 percentage point to 0.13 percentage point, the lowest since
the debt was issued on July 18, Bloomberg data show.  Adjustments to the companies’ government support will
replace a requirement that they pay 10 percent dividends
annually on the capital they’ve drawn from the Treasury. The
firms’ earnings eventually may not have been able to cover that
amount. Their available aid to cover losses and the payouts
would no longer have been unlimited after this year. The
Treasury will also direct the firms to wind down their holdings
of mortgage backed-securities and loans faster.  “All else equal, this change indicates the net supply of
agency MBS from the GSEs to the rest of the market to increase
by $50 to $70 billion in 2013 from what it would have been
otherwise,” Nomura Securities International analysts led by
Ohmsatya Ravi wrote today in a note to clients. The companies
are referred to as government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
