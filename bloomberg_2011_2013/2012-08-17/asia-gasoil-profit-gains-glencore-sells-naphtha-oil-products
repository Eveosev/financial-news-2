Asia ’s gasoil crack spread climbed
to the widest in nine months, signaling increased profit for
refiners. Glencore International Plc sold naphtha and gasoline
cargoes in Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Middle Distillates  The premium of  gasoil , or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude rose 20 cents to $19.85 a barrel at 1:55 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This  crack spread , a measure of refining profit, was the widest
since Nov. 21. It’s poised for a third weekly advance.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil fell 5 cents to 65 cents a
barrel, PVM data showed. This  regrade  is set to drop for a
second week, indicating it’s less profitable to make  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures climbed $25.40, or 34 percent, to $99.68 a metric ton at
4:52 p.m. Singapore time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The difference, also known as the crack spread, was
the widest since April. It’s also set to gain for a third week.  Glencore sold two 25,000-ton cargoes of open-specification
 naphtha  at $953 a ton to Vitol Group, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of traders who monitored transactions on the Platts
window. The shipments are for first-half November delivery.  Glencore, the world’s biggest commodities trader, also sold
50,000 barrels of 97-RON gasoline for Sept. 9 to Sept. 13
loading to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $135.90 a barrel, the survey
showed.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur  fuel oil ’s  discount  to Dubai crude narrowed 15
cents to $3.17 a barrel at 1:55 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM. The gap is set to narrow for the first time in three
weeks, signaling reduced losses for refiners turning crude into
residual fuels.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged for a second day at $13 a ton, PVM data
showed. This  viscosity spread  is to widen for a second week,
meaning bunker, or marine fuel, rose less than supplies used in
power stations.  Refinery News  Utilization at  China ’s biggest refineries fell 3 percentage
points from two weeks ago to an average 80.4 percent of capacity
as of yesterday, according to Oilchem.net. That’s the second-
lowest rate this year. Privately owned facilities in Shandong
province, known as teapot plants, increased operating rates to
an average of 36.3 percent in the week ended Aug. 16,
Oilchem.net said, citing a survey.  Tenders  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. offered to sell 45,000 tons of
high-sulfur fuel oil for September loading from Mailiao,
according to an e-mail sent to prospective buyers.  Honam Petrochemical Corp. bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for
September delivery to Yeosu at a discount of 50 cents a ton to
Japan prices, said two traders with knowledge of the purchase
who asked not to be identified as the information is
confidential.  To contact the reporters on this story:
