Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average capping a second week of advance, after
U.S. building permits reached a four-year high and German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  reiterated her commitment to working
with the  European Central Bank .  Honda (7267)  Motor Co., a carmaker that counts  North America  as
its biggest market, climbed 2.4 percent as the yen traded near
its lowest in a month versus the dollar.  Makita Corp. (6586) , a power-
tool maker that gets more than 40 percent of its sales in
Europe, gained 3.1 percent.  Tokyo  Steel Manufacturing Co. jumped
5 percent after increasing steel scrap prices. Yamaha Motor Co.,
Japan’s second-largest maker of motorcycles, jumped 6.7 percent
after its equity rating was lifted by Credit Suisse Group.  “Investor sentiment is moving to risk-on from risk-off
globally,” said Ichiro Takamatsu, a  fund manager  at Tokyo-based
Bayview Asset Management Co., which manages about $1.9 billion.
“The  U.S. economy  is back on a recovery track. Positive remarks
from the German Chancellor are a benefit for the markets.”  The  Nikkei Stock Average 225 (NKY)  rose 0.8 percent to 9,162.50
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, with a weekly gain of 3.1 percent.
Volume on the gauge was 11 percent above the 30-day average,
even with many investors taking the week off for O-bon holidays.
The broader  Topix (TPX)  gained 0.9 percent to 765.81.  The Topix has fallen 12 percent from this year’s peak on
March 27 on concern earnings would be hurt by Europe’s debt
crisis and slower growth in China and the U.S.  The decline has cut the price of shares on the gauge to 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.4 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less
than one means companies can be bought for less than the value
of their assets.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  were little changed today. The gauge
rose 0.7 percent yesterday after building permits rose to an
812,000 annual pace, the most since August 2008. Permits were
projected to increase to 769,000, according to the median
estimate of 52 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Honda, a carmaker that gets almost 45 percent of its sales
from North America, gained 2.4 percent to 2,642 yen. Uniden
Corp., an electronic equipment maker that counts North America
as its biggest market, added 2.2 percent to 184 yen.  “The U.S. economic deterioration is being curtailed,”
said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura
Holdings Inc. “Euro-region officials are going along with the
ECB, reducing uncertainty. There’s less anxiety out there so we
should see investors continuing to buy.”  Spain Bailout  Shares extended gains after a person familiar with the
matter said Spain is about to get an emergency disbursement from
a 100 billion-euro ($123 billion) bailout package. German
 Chancellor Merkel  said the ECB’s insistence on conditionality in
return for help to lower borrowing costs in indebted countries
matches her country’s priorities to end the crisis in the euro
region.  The euro strengthened against the yen to as much as 98.18
yen today in Tokyo, compared with 97.42 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday, boosting the value of European income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Makita climbed 3.1 percent to 3,010 yen. Ricoh Co., an
office-equipment and camera maker that obtains more than a fifth
of its revenue in Europe, rose 2.3 percent to 658 yen.  Tokyo Steel Manufacturing, an electric furnace steelmaker,
jumped 5 percent to 296 yen after releasing revised price lists
on its website. It raised steel scrap prices for the first time
since April 4, increasing the prices by between 5 percent and 8
percent as of today, reflecting steel scrap markets especially
in Asia, said company spokesman Nobuaki Nara. Steelmakers gained
the most in the Topix’s 33 industry groups.  Yamaha Motor (7272)  soared 6.7 percent to 760 yen after Credit
Suisse boosted the motorcycle maker’s equity rating to
“outperform” from “neutral.” Shipments will likely rebound
in Indonesia from this fiscal year through next fiscal year.  Japan Tobacco Inc. declined the most in the Nikkei 225,
falling 3.7 percent to 2,480 yen after officials and health
researchers said the U.K. and  New Zealand  are among countries
more likely to ban logos from cigarette packages after Australia
approved the world’s first uniform-packaging law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
