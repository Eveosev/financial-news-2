Premier Oil Plc (PMO) , a U.K. explorer
with North Sea and Southeast Asian fields, fell the most in a
month in London after plugging and abandoning a  Vietnam  well.  The  shares  dropped as much as 3.4 percent to 377.2 pence,
the biggest decline since July 23. The company drilled the Chim
Sao North West appraisal well in Vietnam Block 12W to a depth of
4,235 meters (13,895 feet), London-based Premier said today in a
statement. It encountered “only oil shows,” the explorer said.  It slid 1.8 percent to 383.6 pence by 8:40 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
