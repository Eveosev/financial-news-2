A 7-year-old academic paper that surfaced Monday may shed some light on the views of those now at the head of the Egyptian military. On Sunday, Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi ousted Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, leader of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, and General Sami Anan, chief of staff of the Egyptian Armed Forces. Morsi replaced Tantawi with Abdul Fattah al-Sissi, head of military intelligence, and Anan with Sedky Sobhy, commander of the 3rd Field Army in Suez. The Arabist, an independent  Middle East  news website, on Monday  discovered  a 2005 paper by Sobhy,  posted  on a Defense Department website. Sobhy wrote the 10,000-word paper while a masters student at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle,  Pennsylvania . Sobhy recommended "the permanent withdrawal of U.S. military forces from the Middle East and the Gulf" and "the pursuit of U.S. strategic goals in the region through socioeconomic means and the impartial application of international law." He argues that the U.S.'s commitment to  Israel 's security conflicted with other policy objectives in the region, including safeguarding oil supplies. Although many in the Arab world are critical of American foreign policy -- a  June Pew Research Center poll  shows only 11 percent of Egyptians think President  Barack Obama  has dealt fairly with Israelis and Palestinians -- it is rare to hear criticism of American foreign policy in the Middle East from such a senior military official. Egypt is a key American ally and the recipient of more than $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid annually. Sobhy also lamented the lack of communication between the U.S. foreign policy establishment and actors in the Middle East, citing the difference in the role of religion in government: He highlighted U.S. socioeconomic engagement with the Arab world in the 1950s and 1960s as a model to follow, noting that the European Union has gained socioeconomic influence in the region as U.S. influence has waned. Significantly, Sobhy criticized the involvement of the ruling elite in the domestic economy in the Arab world. The Egyptian military holds vast economic power -- last year it made a $1 billion loan to  Egypt 's central bank. The total value of its economic holdings is unknown -- it is considered a state secret -- but the army's empire includes everything from factories to beach resorts. Under Field Marshal Tantawi, the military seemed to believe that economic reform and the lessening of government control over production and prices were threats to social stability. It's unclear what the new balance of power between Mursi and the Supreme Council of Armed forces will be, but Sobhy's thesis offers a relatively anti-establishment outlook from someone now at the reigns of the Egyptian military.
