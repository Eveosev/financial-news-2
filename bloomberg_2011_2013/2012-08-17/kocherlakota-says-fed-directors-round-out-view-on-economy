Federal Reserve  Bank of Minneapolis
President Narayana Kocherlakota praised the “decentralized
nature” of Fed policy making, saying his bank’s board of
directors helps him gain a complete grasp of the economy.  “The Federal Reserve is very good at aggregating and
analyzing data, but data often lag and do not give a complete
description of what is currently happening in the economy,”
Kocherlakota said today in the text of prepared remarks in
Williston, North Dakota. “The information that I receive from
our directors is important in helping me complete that economic
picture.”  The composition of the board of directors at the regional
Fed banks “ensures that the public is represented by directors
who are chosen locally, and not by  Washington ,” Kocherlakota
said. “In this way, the framers of the Federal Reserve Act
carefully balanced national and local interests.”  The Minneapolis Fed chief, who doesn’t vote on the policy-
setting  Federal Open Market Committee  this year, gave similar
remarks in Minot, North Dakota yesterday. He said he sees no
conflict of interest arising from the fact that bankers serve on
the boards of the regional Fed banks.  Kocherlakota didn’t comment on the economy or the outlook
for monetary policy in his prepared remarks today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
