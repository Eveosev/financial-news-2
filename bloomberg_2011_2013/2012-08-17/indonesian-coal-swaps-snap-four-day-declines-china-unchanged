Swap contracts for lower-quality
thermal coal from  Indonesia , the world’s biggest exporter,
snapped four days of declines, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte. Prices for  China  were unchanged.  The swap for sub-bituminous coal with a calorific value of
4,900 kilocalories a kilogram for loading from Indonesia in the
fourth quarter remained at $64 a metric ton on a net-as-received
basis yesterday, the energy broker said in an e-mail today. The
September contract rose 25 cents to $62.  The contract for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South China in the
fourth quarter was unchanged at $83 a ton on a net-as-received
basis, Ginga said. The swap for September remained at $81.75.  The average price for coal at the port of Newcastle in
 Australia , the Asian benchmark, will be $90 to $95 a ton in 2012,
Moody’s Investors Service said today. It compares with 2011’s
average of $120 a ton.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with grades with a better
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
