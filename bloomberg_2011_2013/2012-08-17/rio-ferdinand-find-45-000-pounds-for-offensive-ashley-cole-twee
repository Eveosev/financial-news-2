(Corrects spelling of fined in headline.)  Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has been fined 45,000 pounds ($76,900) for improper
conduct over a post on his Twitter page, the Football
Association said today.  Ferdinand’s fine comes after the F.A. asked an independent
commission to investigate him for endorsing a tweet on the
social-networking website that referred to Chelsea defender
 Ashley Cole  as “choc-ice,” the governing body said.  Cole gave evidence in support of teammate  John Terry  in a
trial in which he was accused of racially abusing Ferdinand’s
brother Anton. Terry was cleared and Ferdinand re-posted the
reference to Cole, who like Ferdiand is off mixed-heritage.  “The commission decided that the comment was improper and
brought the game into disrepute,” the F.A. said. “In addition,
the Commission found that the breach included a reference to
ethnic origin, colour or race.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
