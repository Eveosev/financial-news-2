European Union antitrust authorities
will seek comments on whether an airport used by  Ryanair
Holdings Plc (RYA)  in Belgium received  government aid  that may have
benefited some budget carriers over competitors.  The European Commission in March extended an investigation
into government support for Belgium’s state-owned Charleroi
airport to examine changes to Ryanair’s contracts on airport
access and aid from the local Walloon regional government.  The Brussels-based regulator is inviting interested parties
to contact them about the case as part of its efforts to
establish whether Belgium broke the bloc’s state aid rules,
according to a  statement published  on the EU’s website.  -- Editor: Anthony Aarons  To contact the reporter on this story:
