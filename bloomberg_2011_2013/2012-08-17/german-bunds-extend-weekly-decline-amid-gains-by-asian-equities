Spain ’s two-year notes  advanced  for
a fourth day on speculation the nation will request a sovereign
bailout that would trigger European Central Bank purchases of
its government debt.  Spanish 10-year bonds outperformed most of their euro-
region peers, pushing yields to a six-week low. German 10-year
bonds headed for the biggest weekly decline this month after
Chancellor Angela Merkel signaled support for the ECB’s plan to
insist on conditions in exchange for helping reduce indebted
countries’ borrowing costs. Spain’s two-year yield may drop to 2
percent with ECB purchases, said  Steven Major ,  HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA) ’s head of fixed-income research.  ECB buying “would reinforce the rally in Spanish bonds,”
said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at broker RIA
Capital Markets in Edinburgh. “Given the fragile position of
the Spanish economy, it looks almost inevitable Spain will
require a bailout.” Shorter-term securities are the “most
attractive” maturities, he said.  Spain’s two-year note yield slid 22 basis points, or 0.22
percentage point, to 3.77 percent at 5:39 p.m. London time,
after reaching 3.72 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 7. The
yield has fallen 43 basis points this week. The 4.75 percent
security due July 2014 rose 0.4, or 4 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,230) face amount, to 101.795.  ‘Time is Pressing’  Spain’s 10-year yield dropped eight basis points to 6.44
percent, the least since July 5. The 10-year bund yield fell
three basis points to 1.50 percent, leaving it 11 basis points
higher in the week.  “Obviously time is pressing” on stamping out the debt
crisis, though “on many of these issues we feel we’re on the
right track,” Merkel told reporters in Ottawa at a joint press
conference with Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper 
yesterday. Euro-area policy makers “feel committed to do
everything we can to maintain the common currency.”  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index (SXXP)  rose 0.6 percent, heading for
its 11th weekly rally. The euro weakened 0.3 percent to $1.2323.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on Aug. 2 that the central
bank may buy government debt in unison with the region’s bailout
funds to address elevated yields that are “related to fears of
the reversibility of the euro.”  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said the next day he
would consider triggering the mechanism if it were in the “best
interests of Spaniards,” comments he reiterated on Aug. 14.  Note Yields  “Two percent would be reasonable for a two-year Spanish
bond if the ECB decides it should go there,” HSBC’s Major said
in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with
 Maryam Nemazee . “It’s all about getting those front-end yields
stapled to the floor,” he said, referring to shorter-maturity
government debt.  The  additional yield  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-
year bonds over the notes rose for a second day, increasing 11
basis points to 272 basis points. The spread widened to a record
343 basis points on Aug. 6.  Spanish debt was the most volatile in euro-area markets
today, followed by  Germany  and Portugal, according to measures
of 10-year bonds, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  Portugal’s 10-year bond climbed for the 16th time in 17
days, pushing the yield down nine basis points to 9.76 percent.
That’s the lowest in seven weeks.  Germany’s  Chancellor Angela Merkel  is considering easing
 Greece ’s bailout terms, two German lawmakers said.  Greece’s bond maturing in February 2023 advanced, pushing
the yield down 24 basis points to 24.38 percent. The price
climbed 0.30 to 19.78 percent of face value.  German debt returned 2.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities lost 3.3 percent and Italy’s handed investors 10
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
