The Czech Senate rejected a plan to
raise taxes that the government proposed to cut the  budget
deficit  next year,  Mlada Fronta Dnes  said, citing the result of

Senate. The government can overturn the Senate vote in a new
ballot in the lower house of parliament in Prague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
