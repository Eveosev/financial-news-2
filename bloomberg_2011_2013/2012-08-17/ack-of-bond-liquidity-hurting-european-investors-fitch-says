Investors are concerned about a lack
of liquidity in  Europe ’s corporate bond market as banks cut back
on trading and fund managers hold on to securities for longer.  Two-thirds of participants in a Fitch Ratings survey
published today reported reduced corporate bond liquidity since
the start of the euro crisis. The same is true in the U.S.,
where trading volumes averaged $9.97 billion last month, 8
percent lower than in July 2011, according to data from the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  “It’s something that’s not going away and if it’s already
taking place in the U.S., where the market’s much more liquid
and mature than Europe, then we’re in trouble,” said Adriaan Klop, a  fund manager  at Bryan Garnier Asset Management Ltd. in
Paris.  Buying and selling activity in Europe’s corporate bond
market has declined as banks deleverage because of the
continent’s debt woes and investors hold onto bonds they’ve
bought for longer, even amid a 42 percent jump in issuance this
year compared with the same period of 2011. A knock-on effect is
an increase in spread volatility, fund managers overseeing about
$7.2 trillion of fixed-income assets told Fitch for its third-
quarter survey.  Companies sold 137.6 billion euros of bonds in the common
currency and pounds so far this year, up from 97 billion euros
last year and the most for any equivalent period since 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A total of 41 percent of respondents to Fitch’s survey said
a lack of liquidity is making trading more complicated and time
consuming, while 20 percent said it reduced their interest in
sub-benchmark sized bond issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
