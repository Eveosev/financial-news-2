Most  Chinese stocks  rose, paring the
benchmark index’s biggest weekly loss in two months, as an
increase in U.S. building permits overshadowed concerns about
slowing corporate earnings growth.  EGing Photovoltaic Technology Co. (600537)  paced gains among
companies reliant on overseas sales. CSR Corp., the nation’s
biggest train maker, advanced the most in five weeks after it
won contracts worth 12.7 billion  yuan  ($2 billion).  Yunnan
Copper Industry Co. (000878)  dropped for a third day after first-half
profit fell. Consumer staple and health-care companies, the  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300) ’s best performers this year, declined.  “The  Europe  and the U.S. will provide a stable external
environment to us as their economies may have seen the worst,”
said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities Co. in
 Shanghai . “Corporate earnings haven’t hit bottom and may get
even worse in the third and fourth quarters.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.1 percent to 2,114.89
at the close. About seven stocks gained for every five that
dropped in the gauge, which changed directions at least 20 times
today. The CSI 300 Index declined 0.3 percent to 2,313.48.  The Shanghai Composite lost 2.5 percent this week, the
biggest decline for the five days to June 8, after banks
including Bank of America Corp. cut forecasts for China’s
economic growth. The index tumbled 14 percent from this year’s
high on March 2 through yesterday amid concern the economic
slowdown is worsening. The gauge is  valued  at 9.5 times
estimated profit, compared with the 17.4 average since Bloomberg
began compiling the data in 2006.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong , climbed 1.1 percent today. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, fell 0.9 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Solar Stocks  Exporters advanced after data showed U.S. building permits
rose to an 812,000 annual pace, the most since August 2008.
Permits were projected to increase to 769,000, according to the
median estimate of 52 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  EGing Photovoltaic jumped 2.7 percent to 9.55 yuan. The
maker of solar panels derived 62 percent of sales from overseas
last year, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co.
advanced 2.8 percent to 5.11 yuan. Zhejiang Sunflower Light
Energy Science & Technology Co. climbed 3.3 percent to 6.36
yuan.  In Europe, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said the
 European Central Bank ’s insistence on conditionality in return
for help to lower borrowing costs in indebted countries matches
her country’s priorities to end the crisis in the euro region.  Europe and the U.S. are China’s two biggest export markets,
making up about 35 percent of the nation’s overseas shipments,
according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  Commodity Stocks  CSR gained 2.6 percent to 4.31 yuan, the steepest advance
since July 11. The 12.7 billion yuan contracts are equivalent of
15.7 percent of the company’s 2011 revenue, CSR said in a
statement yesterday.  Thirty-day  volatility  on the Shanghai index was at 12
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.5. About 4.3
billion shares changed hands in the gauge today, the lowest
level since Dec. 26.  Yunnan Copper, China’s fourth-biggest producer of the
metal, retreated 0.7 percent to 16.73 yuan after it said first-
half net income dropped 53 percent from a year earlier.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111) , China’s
biggest producer of rare earth, fell 1.3 percent to 37.62 yuan.
The National Business Daily reported today the company asked its
units to halt production.  Profit Estimates  The Chinese nonferrous metal industry’s first-half profit
slumped 14 percent from a year earlier, while earnings for the
 steel industry  fell 49 percent, the National Development and
Reform Commission said in a statement yesterday.  Second-quarter profits for 57 percent of the 94 Shanghai
Composite companies for which Bloomberg compiles earnings
 forecasts  missed analyst projections, while 40 percent beat, the
data show.  Measures of consumer staple and health-care stocks in the
CSI 300 slid 2.6 percent and 1.5 percent today, the biggest
declines among the 10 industry groups. They have gained 4.3
percent and 7.6 percent this year, respectively.  Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s biggest producer of baijiu
liquor by market value, retreated 4 percent to 229.62 yuan.
Yunnan Baiyao Group Co., a manufacturer of traditional Chinese
medicines, lost 3.1 percent to 61.02 yuan.  Investors were taking breather as consumer and health-care
stocks rose a lot this year, said Wei of West China Securities.  Rate Outlook  The People’s Bank of China may decide to cut benchmark
 interest rates  before required reserve ratios for lenders to
gradually guide funds to flow to the real economy, according to
a front-page article in the Securities Times today. The central
bank is avoiding cutting reserve ratio, which has a longer
period of impact, it said.  “The market is basically fighting between the poorer-than-
expected economic data and the potential for stimulus that could
come, the two forces that are affecting daily moves,” Sam Mahtani, who oversees about $5 billion as director of  emerging
markets  at F&C Asset Management Plc in  London , said by phone
yesterday.  Policy makers cut interest rates in June and July after two
reductions in banks’ reserve-requirement ratios this year to
bolster growth.  China ’s exports grew 1 percent in July after
climbing 11.3 percent in June, data showed last week. Foreign
direct investment declined 8.7 percent in July from a year
earlier to $7.58 billion, the smallest inflow in two years,
Commerce Ministry data showed yesterday.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Chan Tien Hin, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
