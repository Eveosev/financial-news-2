Khonburi Sugar Pcl (KBS) , the worst
performer among  Thailand ’s publicly traded food producers,
forecast profit will increase as much as 50 percent in the next
two years after its new power project comes on stream.  Net income is expected to remain little changed at about
800 million baht ($25 million) this year, Khonburi Director
Issara Twiltermsup said today in an interview in Bangkok, where
the company is based. The 1.7 billion baht, 35-megawatt power
plant will start operations early 2014 and contribute as much as
400 million baht of profit annually, he said.  Khonburi and rival  Khon Kaen Sugar Industry Pcl (KSL)  have
boosted investments in  power plants  to use crushed cane stalks,
called bagasse, as the main fuel for electricity generation. The
revenue from power sales will help shield Khonburi’s earnings
from the volatility in global sugar prices, Issara said.  “The power plant will be the most important driver for
earnings growth because of the limitation in expanding sugar
production,” Issara said. “Sugarcane bagasse is a no-cost fuel
that can contribute substantial value.”  Khonburi slid 9.1 percent this year, the biggest decliner
among 26-member  SET Food & Beverage Index. (SETFOOD)   Profit in the first six months this year fell 17 percent to
550.4 million baht from a year earlier, the company said on Aug.
14. An increase in sugar output will boost net income next year
by about 10 percent, he said.  Khonburi expects sugar production at its plant in Nakhon
Ratchasima province, 200 kilometers (124 miles) northeast of
Bangkok, will increase by 10 percent to about 300,000 metric
tons in 2013, Issara said.  Khon Kaen Sugar, the bigger among the nation’s two publicly
traded sugar mills, in May took a 2.15 billion baht loan from
Kasikornbank Pcl to build power and sugar plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
