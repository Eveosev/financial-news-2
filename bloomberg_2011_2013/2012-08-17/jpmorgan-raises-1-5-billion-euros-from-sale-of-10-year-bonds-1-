JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  raised 1.5
billion euros ($1.85 billion) from its first bond sale in the
currency for more than a year as investors seek to diversify
risk by purchasing non-euro region assets.  The largest U.S. bank priced the 10-year bonds to yield 100
basis points more than the mid-swaps rate, according to a person
familiar with the deal. The notes were initially marketed with a
110 basis-point spread.  The New York-based lender followed Wells Fargo & Co.
and Procter & Gamble Co. in tapping European investors seeking
haven assets. JPMorgan last sold 1 billion euros of 3.75 percent
bonds on June 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It offers a way to increase exposure to non-European
risk, like the recent Wells Fargo deal,” said Gregory Turnbull Schwartz, an Edinburgh-based  fund manager  at Kames Capital,
which manages about 50 billion pounds ($78.5 billion) of assets.  The cost to swap euros for dollars is near the lowest in
three months, according to the 10-year cross-currency basis
swap, making it attractive for issuers to sell bonds in the
common currency. The swap was 32 basis points below the euro
interbank offered rate, or Euribor, at 12:24 p.m. in  London ,
approaching the lowest since May 11.  JPMorgan arranged the deal.  Kate Haywood , a London-
based spokeswoman for the bank, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
