Espirito Santo,  Brazil ’s biggest
robusta coffee-growing state, will have more rain next week,
according to forecaster Somar Meteorologia.  Moisture from the sea is causing wet weather in the state
of Espirito Santo, Marcio Custodio, forecast operating director
at Somar, wrote in a report e-mailed today. Other main growing
areas are dry, he said. Above average rains in June delayed the
arabica coffee crop and reduced the quality of beans that had
already been picked.  To contact the reporters on this story:
