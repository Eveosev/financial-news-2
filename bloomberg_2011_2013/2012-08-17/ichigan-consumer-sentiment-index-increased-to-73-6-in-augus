Confidence among U.S. consumers
unexpectedly improved in August, boosting the prospect of
stronger household spending this quarter.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
August index of consumer  sentiment  increased to 73.6, the
highest level since May, from 72.3 the prior month. The gauge
was projected to be little changed at 72.2, according to the
median forecast of 72 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  After two months of sliding sentiment, August’s advance
indicates consumers may be feeling the benefits of growing
payrolls. Rising confidence raises the odds households can
sustain July’s pickup in retail sales, which set the pace for
stronger growth in the third quarter.  “The fundamentals behind consumers are not that bad,”
George Mokrzan, director of economics for Huntington National
Bank in Columbus,  Ohio , said before the report. “Consumer
finances are improving. We’re actually moving to a stage where
we could get some more substantial improvements” in spending.  Estimates in the survey ranged from 69 to 75. The index
averaged 64.2 during the last recession and 89 in the five years
before the 18-month economic slump that ended in June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
