Share options in  Janus Capital Group
Inc. (JNS) , the Denver-based fund company struggling to reverse
investor defections, were set at a 33 percent premium to the
price before a deal was announced to sell a minority stake to
Tokyo-based insurer  Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. (8750)   Dai-ichi, which agreed Aug. 10 to purchase between 15
percent and 20 percent of Janus shares within one year, will pay
$10.25 a share if it exercises the options, according to a
regulatory filing. The insurer bought about 743,531 shares, or
0.4 percent of Janus shares in the market in the past week, at
an average price of $8.42, according to the filing.  “It doesn’t mean they have to exercise that option,”
 Michael Kim , an analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in
New York. “They have the flexibility to buy the entire 15
percent through the open market.”  Janus Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Weil, a former
executive at Pacific Investment Management Co., the bond-fund
manager co-founded by  Bill Gross , is partnering with Dai-ichi
Life as falling markets and client withdrawals erode assets and
the fees charge for overseeing them. Janus lost 47 percent of
its market value over the past three years through Aug. 9.|  Janus rose 0.2 percent to $8.46 at 9:46 a.m. in New York
trading. The stock advanced 34 percent this year, compared with
the 13 percent gain in the 20-member  Standard & Poor’s  index of
asset managers and custody banks.  Dai-ichi, Japan’s second-largest life insurer, also agreed
to invest $2 billion into Janus funds and help distribute them
in Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
