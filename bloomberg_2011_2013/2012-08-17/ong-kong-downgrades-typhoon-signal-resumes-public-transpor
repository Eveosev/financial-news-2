Hong Kong  lowered its tropical
cyclone warning to Strong Wind Signal No. 3, the second-lowest
level, as Typhoon Kai-tak moved away from the city toward
 China .  Kai-tak was estimated to be about 350 kilometers (217
miles) west-southwest of Hong Kong at 9 a.m. and was forecast
to move toward China’s Leizhou Peninsula, the city’s
observatory said on its website.  The government hasn’t received any reports of flooding or
landslides, while a total of 40 flights have been delayed or
canceled, it said in an e-mailed statement at 7 a.m. local
time. Public transport has resumed gradually, it said.  Last month, Typhoon Vicente, the most serious storm to
hit Hong Kong since 1999, felled trees throughout the city and
damaged a coal conveyor belt at a  CLP Holdings Ltd. (2)  power
station. Plastic pellets owned by China Petroleum and Chemical
Corp. spilled into the city’s waters from a ship during the
storm, affecting fishermen.  There were six reports of tree damage received as of this
morning, the city’s government said. The education bureau said
kindergartens and special schools will remain closed for the
day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
