Xiamen Airlines Co. ,  China ’s only
all- Boeing Co. (BA)  carrier, is in talks about ordering 30 737 MAX
planes as it expands domestic and international services, an
official at the airline said.  Negotiations are at an early stage and the carrier could
instead opt for  Airbus SAS (EAD)  A320neo aircraft, said the official,
who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private.
The order would be worth as much as  $3.2 billion  at list prices.
Carriers typically get discounts.  Xiamen Air, a unit of China Southern Airlines Co., agreed
to order 40 737-800s earlier this month as China’s rising wages
spur travel in the world’s most populous nation. The MAX and
A320neo are revamped versions of Airbus and Boeing’s bestselling
aircraft, featuring new engines and other improvements designed
to help reduce fuel use.  Boeing doesn’t comment on discussions with customers, said
Wang Yukui, a Beijing-based spokesman for the planemaker.  The 737 MAX is due to enter service in 2017, two years
after the A320neo. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China is also
working on a new narrow-body plane, the C919, which is scheduled
to begin test flights in 2014.  China Southern (1055) , the nation’s biggest carrier by passenger
numbers, fell 2.4 percent to HK$3.74 as of 2 p.m. in  Hong Kong 
trading today. The stock has fallen 29 percent in the past year.  Xiamen Air operates six 757s and 77 737s, Boeing said in an
Aug. 3 statement. The carrier plans to expand its fleet to 200
planes by the end of 2020, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
