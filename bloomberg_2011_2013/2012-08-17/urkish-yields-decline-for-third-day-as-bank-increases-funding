Turkish  bond yields  dropped for a
third day to the lowest level in a week as the central bank
increased its funding after signaling a rate cut yesterday.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 7.73 percent at the close in Istanbul
after falling as much as six basis points. The three-day decline
totaled 25 basis points, the biggest drop in that period since
July 6. The lira weakened 0.4 percent to 1.8009 per dollar at
7:15 p.m., depreciating for the first time in three days.  The central bank provided 7.5 billion liras ($4.2 billion)
at its lowest annual funding rate of 5.75 percent via one-week
 repurchase agreements , the most since Dec. 16. It also lent 4.5
billion liras in a one-month repo auction, held once a week on
Fridays. The total funding exceeded banks’ repayments of 6
billion liras for weekly repo they borrowed on Aug. 10 and 2
billion liras for monthly repo from July 20.  The central bank raised the maximum amount it may provide
via one-week repo at its benchmark rate of 5.75 percent to 7.5
billion liras at the Monetary Policy Committee meeting
yesterday, up from 6.5 billion liras since July 19.  The Ankara-based bank kept the benchmark rate unchanged, as
well as its highest lending rate of 11.5 percent, saying it may
narrow the interest-rate corridor “gradually in the coming
period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
