Etihad Airways  PJSC, the Abu Dhabi-
based carrier, said it’s not holding discussions with  Ryanair
Holdings Plc (RYA)  about buying the budget carrier’s 30 percent stake
in Aer Lingus Group Plc.  “Etihad Airways is not in talks with Ryanair regarding its
stake in Aer Lingus,” the airline said in an e-mailed statement
today. “If approached by Ryanair we would be happy to have a
discussion about the stake, and evaluate the opportunity as we
would any other commercial proposition.”  The Middle Eastern carrier, which owns 3 percent of  Aer
Lingus (AERL) , has had talks about buying the Irish state’s 25 percent
stake as it invests overseas to help bolster traffic through its
Abu Dhabi hub. Etihad also has stakes in  Air Berlin Plc (AB1) ,  Virgin
Australia Holdings Ltd. (VAH)  and Air Seychelles Ltd.  “Dublin is a strong and profitable route for Etihad
Airways,” the carrier said. “We’re very keen to strengthen our
partnership there.”  Ryanair has offered to buy the rest of Aer Lingus to
bolsters its operations in Ireland. The bid has drawn opposition
from management and politicians and sparked a review by European
Union regulators who blocked a similar takeover bid in 2006.  The Dublin-based carrier said in its June bid statement
that if Etihad or another investor acquired the government stake
in Aer Lingus it would be willing to enter into talks about
selling its holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
