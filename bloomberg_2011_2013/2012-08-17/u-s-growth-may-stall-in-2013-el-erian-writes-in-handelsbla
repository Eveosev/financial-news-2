The  U.S. economy  is likely to grow
only 2 percent in 2013 and there’s a risk that growth will
stall, Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive officer and co-
chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co.,
wrote in  Handelsblatt .  The  budget deficit  will probably continue at about 10
percent of gross domestic product, giving the president little
room for maneuver, El-Erian wrote. Europe’s debt crisis is
likely to escalate in the coming months and China’s economic
dynamism will probably decline further, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
