Greek Labor Minister Ioannis Vroutsis gave the country’s highest court the names of 1,014
people who receive a state pension but are not registered,
Athens News Agency said.  Vroutsis submitted the information today as part of the
court’s investigation into fake pensions and those who
facilitated their payment, costing the state millions of euros a
year, state-run ANA reported, without citing anyone.  In May 2011, the state froze the pensions of the 1,014
people, who received the payments from the Agricultural
Insurance Fund,  OGA , ANA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
