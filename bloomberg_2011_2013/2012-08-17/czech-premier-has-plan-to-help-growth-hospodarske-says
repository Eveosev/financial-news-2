The Czech government is preparing a
program to restart growth after the economy shrank for three
straight quarters,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing Premier
Petr Necas.  Construction of two new units at the Temelin nuclear power
plant, estimated at about $10 billion, and modernization of the
electricity grid are among projects that may boost the economy,
the Prague-based newspaper quoted Necas as saying in an
interview published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
