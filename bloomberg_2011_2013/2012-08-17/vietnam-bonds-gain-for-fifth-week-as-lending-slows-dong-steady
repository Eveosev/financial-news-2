Vietnam ’s government bonds gained
for a fifth week on speculation banks increased debt holdings as
lending slowed. The dong was little changed.  The five-year yield fell to the lowest level in more than
two months after the central bank said in a statement yesterday
that lending growth this year won’t exceed 8 percent to 10
percent. The estimate is lower than a government target of 15
percent to 17 percent announced in January.  “Because of sluggish lending, some banks have surplus of
funds to buy more bonds,” Vu Anh Duc, the Hanoi-based deputy
director of the investment department at Vietnam Joint-Stock
Commercial Bank for Industry & Trade, said by telephone today.
“Bonds are still a relatively safe and profitable investment
channel now.”  The yield on five-year notes fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 9.61 percent this week, according to a
daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
dropped one basis point today to the lowest level since June 14.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam cut the 2012 credit growth
forecast as rising unsold inventory in a slowing economy curbs
demand for loans from businesses. Credit increased 1.07 percent
in the Jan. 1 to Aug. 8 period, according to the central bank.
Economic expansion slowed to less than 5 percent in the first
half from 5.89 percent in all of 2011, according to data from
the General Statistics Office. Deputy Prime Minister Vu Van Ninh
has said the country may miss its 6 percent full-year growth
target.  The dong traded at 20,845 per dollar as of 4:45 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared to 20,850 yesterday, and 20,853 a week earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set
the currency’s reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec.
26, according to its website. The dong is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
