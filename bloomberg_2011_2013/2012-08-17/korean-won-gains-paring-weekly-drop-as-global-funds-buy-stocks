The South Korean won rose, paring a
weekly decline, as optimism the nation’s economy will withstand
European turmoil lured global investors to increase purchases of
domestic stocks. Bonds are set for a second weekly loss.  Exchange data showed overseas investors bought $3.9 billion
more local shares than they sold this month, the biggest net
purchases among 11 Asian nations tracked by Bloomberg.
Government data yesterday showed the jobless rate fell to a
seven-month low of 3.1 percent in July from 3.2 percent in June.  “We expect persistent foreign stock purchases to shore up
the won quite well, together with exporter settlements,” said
Jeon Seung Ji, a Seoul-based currency analyst at Samsung Futures
Inc. “And hopes for more stimulus are still alive which will
help fuel risk appetite.”  The won climbed 0.2 percent to 1,132.10 per dollar at 9:21
a.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency fell 0.2 percent this week, the first loss in a month.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was little changed at 7.3 percent.  Sales at major Korean department stores fell for the second
straight month in July, data showed today and the central bank
may cut its benchmark  interest rate  next month, helping to
support demand, said An Ki Tae, an economist at Woori Investment
& Security in Seoul.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.06
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. It jumped 16 basis
points this week. Three-year debt futures were at 105.67, from
105.63 yesterday and 106.19 at the end of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
