Western areas of the U.K. may get
“heavy rain” today, while temperatures climb in the south and
east, the  Met Office  said.  Parts of  Wales  and northern  England  may have more than 60
millimeters (2.4 inches) of rain and strong winds, before storms
ease by early tomorrow, the national weather  forecaster  said
today on its website. Southeast England will be “much drier,”
it said. Temperatures will climb through the weekend, reaching
30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of Kent and
East Anglia on Aug. 19, it forecast.  “While it will be hot in the south east, we’re not
expecting wall-to-wall sunshine and it will feel quite humid and
oppressive over the weekend,” Chief Met Office Forecaster
Martin Young said in the statement. “As we head into next week,
south westerly winds will push that humid air away to bring
fresher conditions and showers to north west Britain.”  Farmers in the U.K.,  Europe ’s third-largest wheat producer,
made “good progress” on the harvest last week as the weather
stayed mostly dry, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development
Board said in a  report  yesterday. Damp weather this summer has
eroded crop quality and delayed plant maturity, the Kenilworth,
England-based researcher has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
