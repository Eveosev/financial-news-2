Millions of Iranians, chanting
“Death to Israel,” took to the streets in major cities to mark
Jerusalem Day, FARS news agency reported.  The late  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , founder of the
Islamic Republic, designated the last Friday of the Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan as Jerusalem Day, known as Quds Day in
Iran. The agency said those taking part in today’s rallies
voiced Iran’s readiness to “defend the ideals of  Palestine  and
remove the cancerous tumor,” a reference to Israel, “from the
face of the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
