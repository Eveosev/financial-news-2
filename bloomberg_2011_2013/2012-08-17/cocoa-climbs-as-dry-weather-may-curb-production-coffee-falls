Cocoa gained for the first time in
three days in  New York  on speculation dry weather will cut
output in West Africa, supplier of about two-thirds of the
world’s crop. Arabica coffee slid and sugar rose.  Ghana ’s western region, the largest growing area of the
second-biggest producer, got 4.5 millimeters (0.2 inch) of rain
from Aug. 1 to Aug. 10 in three towns monitored, data from the
Ghana Meteorological Agency showed. That compares with 35.4
millimeters a year earlier. Neighboring  Ivory Coast  is the
biggest cocoa grower.  “Current weather conditions are not supportive for the
main crop harvests in West Africa,” Keith Flury, an analyst at
Rabobank International in  London , said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. “We expect further upside.”  Cocoa for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to $2,412 a
metric ton by 7:32 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Cocoa
for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to 1,617 pounds
($2,538) a ton by on NYSE Liffe in London.  Global demand may outpace supply by 133,000 tons in the
2012-13 season, or 270,000 tons if El Nino returns, Flury said.
There are renewed signs that El Nino is forming,  Australia ’s
Bureau of Meteorology said Aug. 14.  Raw sugar for October delivery added 0.2 percent to 20.20
cents a pound in New York. White, or refined, sugar for October
delivery fell 0.3 percent to $558.10 a ton in London.  Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$1.607 a pound on ICE, the seventh consecutive decline, the
longest losing streak for a most-active contract since Feb. 16.
Robusta coffee for November delivery was unchanged at $2,103 a
ton NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
