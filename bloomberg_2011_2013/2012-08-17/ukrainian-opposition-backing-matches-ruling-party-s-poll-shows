Support for jailed former Prime
Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko ’s opposition party has drawn level
with that of President  Viktor Yanukovych ’s ruling party two
months before parliamentary elections, an opinion poll showed.  Tymoshenko’s Batkivshchyna, or Fatherland, party has 19.6
percent backing, compared with 19 percent for Yanukovych’s Party
of Regions, the  Razumkov Center for Economic and Political
Studies , based in the capital, Kiev, said today in an e-mailed
statement. The poll of 10,979 people has a margin of error of 1
percentage point.  Tymoshenko says her seven-year sentence for abuse of office
was engineered by Yanukovych to keep her from participating in
the Oct. 28 elections. Other opposition leaders including former
Defense Minister Anatoliy Hrytsenko and former Parliamentary
Speaker Arseniy Yarsenyuk have joined forces with her party
before the vote.  The party of boxer Vitali Klitschko was backed by 9.5
percent of those polled, while the Communist Party had 7.5
percent support. The survey was conducted between July 27 and
Aug. 9 by the Razumkov Center, the Rating sociology group, the
Center for Social and Marketing Research Sotsis and GfK Ukraine.  To contact the reporters on this story:
