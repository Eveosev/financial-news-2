The following is the text of
 Canada ’s consumer  price index  report for July released
by  Statistics Canada .  Consumer prices rose 1.3% in the 12 months to July,
following a 1.5% gain in June. Higher prices for the purchase of
passenger vehicles, food purchased from restaurants, meat and
electricity were major factors in the increase of the July
Consumer Price Index (CPI).  12-month change in the major components  Consumer prices rose for every major component in the 12
months to July, with the exception of clothing and footwear.  Food prices rose 2.1% in the 12 months to July following a
2.0% advance in June. These two increases were the lowest year-
over-year gains in food prices since the beginning of 2011.
Leading the July increase were higher prices for food from
restaurants (+2.4%), meat (+5.3%) and cereal products (+3.7%).
In contrast, prices for fresh vegetables declined for the fifth
consecutive month.  Shelter costs rose 1.0% in the 12 months to July after
increasing 1.3% the previous month. Increases for electricity
prices, homeowner’s replacement cost, and rent were major
factors leading to the July rise in shelter costs. Natural  gas
prices  continued to fall on a year-over-year basis.  Higher costs for telephone services and financial services
led to year-over-year price gains for the household operations,
furnishings and equipment component.  Prices for transportation rose 1.1% on a year-over-year
basis in July after increasing 1.7% in June. The cost for the
purchase of passenger vehicles increased 2.3% in July, following
a 3.9% rise the previous month.  The only major component which declined in the 12 months to
July was clothing and footwear (-0.7%), led by price declines
for women’s clothing.  Energy prices  Energy prices fell 1.2% in the 12 months to July after
declining 0.8% in June.  Natural gas prices dropped 15.2% on a year-over-year basis,
continuing a pattern of declines observed since January 2011.
Notable declines were recorded in Ontario and  Alberta .  Gasoline prices fell 1.3% in the 12 months to July, the
third consecutive year-over-year decline. Prices for gasoline
decreased in the Atlantic provinces, Ontario and  Quebec , while
they rose in the Western provinces.  The cost of electricity increased 3.7% year over year in
July, after a 5.9% rise the month before. Increases in
electricity prices in Ontario were the biggest factor in this
rise.  12-month change in the provinces  Consumer prices rose at a slower rate in eight provinces on
a year-over-year basis in July compared with June. Prices in
Ontario grew at the slowest pace of any province, while the
Quebec CPI recorded the largest increase.  The Ontario CPI rose 0.7% year over year in July, the
smallest increase in the province since October 2009. As in June,
Ontario recorded the smallest rate of increase for food
purchased from stores, which rose 0.8% in July. This compares
with a 1.9% increase for Canada. Gasoline prices declined 3.7%
in the 12 months to July.  Consumer prices in Quebec increased 1.9% in the 12 months
to July after rising 2.0% in June. Prices for food purchased
from restaurants, which accounts for a significant proportion of
 consumer spending  in the province, rose 3.6% in July. Prices for
the purchase of passenger vehicles and meat also increased.  In Manitoba, consumer prices rose 1.8% in July after
increasing 1.4% in June. This faster increase was mainly the
result of larger price gains for gasoline, which rose 5.2% in
July, following a 0.7% increase in June.  Seasonally adjusted monthly Consumer Price Index decreases  On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI declined
0.1% in July, after decreasing 0.2% in June. This marked the
third consecutive monthly decline in the seasonally adjusted CPI.  The seasonally adjusted index for transportation fell 0.6%
in July, following a 1.1% decline in June. The clothing and
footwear index declined 0.9% after falling 0.1% the previous
month. In contrast, prices for food increased 0.4% on a
seasonally adjusted monthly basis in July.  Bank of Canada’s core index  The Bank of Canada’s core index
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/62-001-x/2012007/technote -
notetech2-eng.htm) rose 1.7% in the 12 months to July, following
a 2.0% gain in June.  On a monthly basis, the seasonally adjusted core index was
unchanged in July for the second consecutive month.  Note to readers  The special aggregate “Energy” includes: electricity;
natural gas;  fuel oil  and other fuels; gasoline; and fuel, parts
and supplies for recreational vehicles.  The Bank of Canada’s core index excludes eight of the
 Consumer Price Index ’s most volatile components (fruit, fruit
preparations and nuts; vegetables and vegetable preparations;
mortgage interest cost; natural gas; fuel oil and other fuels;
gasoline; inter-city transportation; and tobacco products and
smokers’ supplies) as well as the effects of changes in indirect
taxes on the remaining components.  A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal
movements have been eliminated. Users employing Consumer Price
Index data for indexation purposes are advised to use the
unadjusted indexes. For more information on seasonal adjustment,
