Malaysia’s ringgit completed its
worst week since June as concern a slowdown in China will
deepen, dimmed the Southeast Asian nation’s export outlook.  The ringgit erased earlier gains, in tandem with other
regional currencies, amid fading expectations that the  Federal
Reserve  will boost asset purchases. A government report
yesterday showed foreign investment in China, Malaysia’s biggest
export market in June, fell 8.7 percent in July from a year
earlier to $7.58 billion, the smallest inflow since July 2010.  “A slowdown in China will have a negative impact on
Malaysia’s economic growth,” said Lam Chee Mun, a  fund manager 
at TA Investment Management Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The flight
to safety will further strengthen the dollar.”  The ringgit decreased 0.1 percent to 3.1340 per dollar as
of 6:05 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It dropped 0.4 percent this week, the most since
June.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was steady at 6.7 percent. It
climbed 40 basis points, or 0.4 percentage point, for the week.  Malaysia’s five-year bonds fell this week, with the yield
on the 3.314 percent notes due October 2017 rising 11 basis
points to 3.34 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The rate
fell four basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
