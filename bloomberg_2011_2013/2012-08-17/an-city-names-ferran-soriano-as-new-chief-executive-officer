English Premier League champion
 Manchester City  named former Barcelona official Ferran Soriano
as its new chief executive officer.  Soriano, 45, held the same role, along with that of vice
chairman, at Barcelona until 2008. He’ll begin work on Sept. 1,
City said on its website.  City has been looking to recruit a new chief executive
since Garry Cook resigned almost a year ago following
controversy over an e-mail he sent to a player’s mother,
appearing to ridicule her cancer.  “The process of finding a chief executive officer has been
deliberate, far reaching and exhaustive,” Chairman Khaldoon al
Mubarak said. “In Ferran we have our preferred candidate. His
experience in football, and in the wider commercial world, make
him exceptionally well to lead Manchester City through its
continued evolution.”  Soriano most recently was chairman of Spanair SA, a Spanish
airline that collapsed into bankruptcy in January. It was the
first failed European airline since the last recession ended in
2009.  City, bankrolled by Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed  Al
Nahyan , won its first league title since 1968 in May.  Soriano grew Barcelona’s sales from 123 million euros ($152
million) to 308 million euros during the five years he worked
there, City said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
