Typhoon Kai-tak knocked down trees
and flattened crops when it made landfall today in southern
 China ’s Guangdong province, where authorities had evacuated more
than 18,000 people ahead of the storm.  The typhoon hit the city of Zhanjiang at 12:30 p.m. local
time with winds as fast as 137 kilometers (85 miles) per hour,
the China Meteorological Administration said. Kai-tak was
forecast to dump 250 millimeters (9.8 inches) to 300 millimeters
of rain on parts of Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan provinces, the
weather agency said. No deaths or injuries have yet to be
reported.  Guangdong had as of 8:00 p.m. yesterday evacuated 18,972
people and called 51,286 fishing boats back to port, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported. Authorities also stopped
some train services in Guangdong and the island province of
Hainan, according to Xinhua.  Hong Kong  late yesterday issued a No. 8 gale signal, the
city’s third highest, for Typhoon Kai-tak. That was downgraded
this morning to a No. 3 signal and lowered later to a No. 1
Standby Signal, the  Hong Kong Observatory  said on its website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
