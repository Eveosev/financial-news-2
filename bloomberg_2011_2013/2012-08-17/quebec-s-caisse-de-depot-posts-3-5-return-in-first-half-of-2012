Caisse de Depot et Placement du
 Quebec ,  Canada ’s largest pension- fund manager , posted a 3.5
percent investment return in the first half of the year with
gains in all its main asset classes.  The Caisse had C$5.4 billion ($5.46 billion) in investment
income in the first half of the year, and depositors made net
contributions of C$1.4 billion, the Montreal-based fund manager
said today in a statement. Net assets rose to C$165.7 billion as
of June 30 from C$159 billion on Dec. 31.  The results beat the 3.3 percent median return for Canadian
pension funds during the first half, as estimated in a July
report by RBC Investor Services. They fell short of the 3.7
percent return for the Caisse’s benchmark portfolio.  Private equity and publicly traded stocks drove the first-
half performance, generating C$3 billion in investment income,
the Caisse said. Equity investments returned 4.2 percent,
compared with 2.6 percent for “inflation-sensitive”
investments such as real estate and 2 percent for fixed income,
the  money manager  said.  The Caisse oversees pensions for retirees in the French-
speaking province of Quebec. It had about 37 percent of its
assets each invested in publicly traded stocks and fixed income
as of June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
