Sameer Africa Ltd., (SAME)  a Kenyan tire
maker, fell the most in more than three months on investor
concern over another change in the chief executive officer.  Shares in the company plunged 6.3 percent to 3.70 shillings
by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the biggest fall
since May 9.  Sameer appointed Allan Walmsley as managing director
starting on Sept. 1, it said on Aug. 13. He replaces Michael
Karanja, who will continue until his contract ends on Aug. 31,
it said.  “The rotation in the top seat would unnerve some
investors,”  Aly-Khan Satchu , chief executive officer of
Nairobi-based investment company Rich Management Ltd., said in a
phone interview today.  Walmsley will be the third chief executive officer in six
years, taking over from Karanja who joined in 2008 when Eric
Kimani left after two years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The stock has declined 16 percent this year and is the
third-worst performer on the Nairobi Securities Exchange All
Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
