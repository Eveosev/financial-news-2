Indian stocks advance for the third
consecutive week amid signs the  U.S. economy  is improving and as
Germany signaled its support for a European Central Bank plan to
resolve the crisis.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, increased 0.1
percent to 17,681.61, according to preliminary closing prices in
Mumbai, taking this week’s rally to 0.7 percent. The market is
closed on Aug. 20 for Eid holiday.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  climbed for
a third day after Jaguar Land Rover sales surged 41 percent.
 Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the biggest home-products maker,
rallied to a record.  Applications for construction permits in the U.S. rose to
the highest since August 2008, a month before the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., signaling stabilization in the
housing market that triggered the crisis. German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said the ECB’s insistence on conditionality in
return for helping cut interest rates for indebted governments
matches her priorities.  The Sensex has risen 15 percent this year, helped by record
overseas  investor  purchases. Foreign funds bought a net $50
million of stocks on Aug. 14, taking their investments in local
equities this year to $11.4 billion, data from the market
regulator show. That’s an all-time high for the period and the
most this year among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
