Lithuania’s  economy  will probably
grow at a slower pace than previously estimated next year as
 Europe ’s debt crisis hurts exporters, the central bank said.  Gross domestic product will expand 3.4 percent, down from a
May estimate of 3.5 percent,  Lietuvos Bankas , based in the
capital, Vilnius, predicted today in an e-mailed statement. It
kept this year’s 3 percent growth estimate unchanged.  GDP growth slowed to 2.1 percent from a year earlier in the
second quarter, missing economist forecasts, as the Baltic
country’s biggest exporter, Orlen Lietuva AB, curbed output. The
Baltic economy is slowing from the second-fastest pace in the
European Union last year as the continent’s debt crisis lowers
demand for its products.  “External demand will grow less in the quarters to come,
thus export growth in  Lithuania  may decline more,” the central
bank said. “It is likely to recover only next year, if global
economic development is more dynamic.”  The central bank also cut next year’s inflation-rate
forecast to 2.4 percent from 2.7 percent, keeping the 2012
estimate unchanged at 2.9 percent.  Consumer-price growth accelerated to 2.8 percent in July,
the fastest in three months. Lithuania needs price growth to
ease to qualify for planned euro adoption in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
