A  Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM)  lawsuit
against the website Chinastockwatch.com over alleged false
information posted about the company was dismissed by a New York
state court judge.  Silvercorp sued Chinastockwatch.com and Alfredlittle.com
and their operators in September, accusing the sites of
publishing false information to lower the company’s share price
and profit on short sales. In a short sale, an investor sells
borrowed shares, hoping to return them to the lender after
buying the stock back at a lower price.  Anthion Management LLC in March filed a countersuit
identifying itself as the author of an anonymous report on
Silvercorp that was sent to securities regulators, auditors and
journalists and later published on Chinastockwatch.com.  Justice Carol R. Edmead dismissed the countersuit last
month and yesterday granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss
the lawsuit, agreeing with Anthion’s argument that the
defamation claim should be thrown out because the statements are
“non-actionable, constitutionally protected opinion.”  “The content of the communications at issue, their tone
and stated purpose show that Anthion was expressing its view
that Silvercorp potentially committed accounting fraud,” Edmead
wrote in her decision.  A voice-mail message left with Vancouver-based Silvercorp
spokesman Jonathan Hackshaw seeking comment on the ruling wasn’t
immediately returned.  The case is Silvercorp Metals v. Chinastockwatch.com,
150374/2011,  New York  State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
