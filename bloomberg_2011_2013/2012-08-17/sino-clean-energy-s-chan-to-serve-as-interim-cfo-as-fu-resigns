Sino Clean Energy Inc. (SCEI) , a coal-water
slurry fuel producer, said Hon Wan Chan will serve as interim
chief financial officer following the resignation of Wen Fu.  Chan’s appointment as full-time CFO will be subject to the
approval of the board of directors, the company said in a
regulatory filing dated Aug 10. Chan served as vice president of
finance since February 2010.  Sino Clean Fuel  said  on Aug. 15 that it received a letter
from the  Nasdaq  Stock Market LLC on Aug. 7 saying the company’s
shares would be delisted because of allegations that listing
rules had been violated.  “The company strongly disagrees with NASDAQ’s findings and
intends to appeal the delisting determination,” the Xi’an,
Shaanxi Province-based company said in the statement.  Fu’s resignation wasn’t a result of any disagreements on
matters relating to the company’s operations, policies or
practices, Sino Clean Energy said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
