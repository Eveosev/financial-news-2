Ann Inc. (ANN) , owner of the Ann Taylor
and LOFT clothing brands, rose to the highest since 2007 after
reporting profit that beat analystsâ€™ estimates and raising its
full-year revenue forecast.  Ann  advanced  20 percent to $33.89 at the close in  New York ,
the highest intraday price since October 2007. The  shares  had
gained 14 percent this year through yesterday.  Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill has sought to draw
shoppers with smaller stores and less expensive clothing. Sales
in the second quarter rose 6.6 percent to $594.9 million, the
New York-based company said in a statement today.  Net income in the quarter ended July 28 jumped 24 percent
to $30.7 million, or 63 cents a share, from $24.8 million, or 47
cents, a year earlier, Ann said today. Analysts projected 51
cents, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue for the year will rise to $2.39 billion, compared
with a previous estimate of $2.38 billion, Ann said. Analysts
had projected $2.38 billion, the average of 15 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ann, which also owns factory and outlet locations, had 962
retail stores as of July 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
