A clash between striking  Lonmin Plc (LMI) 
workers and police at Marikana in South Africa yesterday led to
the deaths of 34 people while 78 are injured and 259  have been
arrested, Riah Phiyega, the country’s police commissioner, said
at a press conference at the mine today.  The police retrieved six firearms including one from a
police officer murdered in mine violence earlier this week, she
said.  “Its a time to mourn a sad and dark moment for our
country,” she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
