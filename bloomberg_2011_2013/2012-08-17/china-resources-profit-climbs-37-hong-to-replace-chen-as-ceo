China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291) , the
government-backed partner of  SABMiller Plc. (SAB) , rose the most since
2008 in  Hong Kong  trading after reporting first-half growth rose
37 percent and naming a new chief executive officer.  The stock rose 11 percent to HK$24.25, its biggest gain
since December 2008.  Net income  surged to HK$2.24 billion ($288
million) in the six months ended June and sales jumped 20
percent to HK$64 billion.  China Resources expanded its beer and retail business by
 buying rivals  to tap the country’s growing domestic consumption
as incomes rise. China’s gross domestic product expanded 7.6
percent in the three months ended June.  Hong Jie will become CEO, replacing Chen Lang, who will
take the chairman’s role, the company said. Qiao Shibo resigned
as chairman because of “other work allocation” by the  China
Resources  Group, it said.  Profit at the beer division, which makes China’s best-
selling Snow beer with SABMiller, rose 14 percent to HK$375
million. Retail earnings jumped 60 percent, helped by asset
revaluations, it said. Excluding one-time items, profit from the
company’s supermarkets and other outlets fell 3.6 percent.  The “short-term operating environment” in China will
continue to be affected by the global economy, the company said
in today’s statement. Consumer spending is expected to be
supported by government initiatives, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
