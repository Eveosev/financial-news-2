The  New York  City Department of
Education said 55 percent of this year’s eligible teachers were
granted tenure, compared to 97% in 2007.  The DOE’s new approach to teacher tenure raises the bar by
asking principals to provide detailed evidence to support their
tenure recommendations, Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott said
today in a statement.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
