JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  hedged 27
percent of its fuel needs for the third and fourth quarters.  The carrier expects fuel needs, including the impact of
hedges and taxes, to average $3.13 a gallon in the third quarter
and $3.18 for the full year, New York-based JetBlue said in a
July 25 statement.  JetBlue said that it used crude call options, jet fuel
swaps and collars, a protective options strategy to help prevent
massive losses, to lock in its fuel requirements and that the
cost projections were based on the curve as of July 20.  Delta Air Lines Inc. said in a July 25 statement that it
expected fuel to average $3.09 a gallon and $3.05 in the fourth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
