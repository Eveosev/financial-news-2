Romania ’s hydropower generator
Hidroelectrica SA will see its output decline 11 percent this
year from a year ago as a prolonged drought lowered water levels
and prompted the company to cut electricity supplies.  The power company’s production will total about 13
terawatts per hour this year, down from 14.6 terawatts in 2011,
Remus Borza, Hidroelectrica’s judicial administrator, who now
manages the insolvent company, told reporters in Bucharest
today. The output is 26 percent lower than the 17.6 terawatts-
per-hour output under normal conditions, Borza said.  “Hidroelectrica will post a historical low production in
2012, after two consecutive years of drought, as its output will
reach about 13 terawatts per hour compared with a budgeted
output of 15.6 terawatts for this year,” Borza said.  A prolonged drought in the past two months in the country
prompted Hidroelectrica to cut electricity supplies this month
by 36 percent from Aug. 7. The producer lowered its power output
to about 700 gigawatts per hour compared with budgeted
production for this month of 1,100 gigawatts per hour, it said
on Aug. 6.  Romanian hydropower production will probably rebound toward
the end of the year as the drought is expected to peak in
October, Deputy Economy Minister Rodin Traicu said yesterday.  Water flows on the Danube,  Europe ’s second-longest river,
will return to a normal rate of about 5,500 cubic meters per
second during “the winter months,” restoring drought-affected
hydropower production, according to Traicu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
