Nigeria ’s naira weakened against the
dollar, paring its second weekly gain, after oil sales declined
and the central bank sold the least amount of the U.S. currency
in more than three months. Bond yields fell.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer declined 0.6
percent to 157.80 per dollar as of 1:10 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has gained 0.3 percent this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $274 million at its twice-
weekly foreign-currency auctions this week, the lowest since the
five days to May 11, according to data on its website. Dollar
sales by the oil industry, the second-largest supplier after the
central bank, didn’t meet expectations, Sewa Wusu, a currency
analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said.  “Dollar supply is a bit tight,” Wusu said by phone today.
“Expectations of dollar sales by some  oil companies  are yet to
materialize.”  Yields on the nation’s 16.39 percent bonds due 2022
declined 50 basis points to 15.53 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, after a report today that showed
inflation slowed.  The  inflation rate  in the West African country declined to
12.8 percent in July from 12.9 percent a month earlier, the
Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics said.  Borrowing costs on the country’s $500 million of Eurobonds
due 2021 fell three basis points to 5 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi was little changed at 1.9455 per dollar as of
12:02 p.m. in Accra, the capital, from 1.9458 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
