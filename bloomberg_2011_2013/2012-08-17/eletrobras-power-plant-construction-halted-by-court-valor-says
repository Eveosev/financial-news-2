Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) 
had the construction of a 1.2 billion-real ($590 million) power
plant suspended by Brazil’s audit court, Valor Economico
reported, citing the ruling.  The court, known as TCU, found irregularities in the
bidding process through which construction company Andrade
Gutierrez SA won the contract to build the plant, after the
other five bidders were disqualified, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said.  The gas-fired power plant contract was awarded by
Eletrobras’s Amazonas Energia SA unit, Valor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
