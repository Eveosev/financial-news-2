England bowled out South Africa for
309 on the second day of the third and final cricket Test at 
Lord’s.  Greame Swann got the last wicket by dismissing Vernon
Philander, who hit a career high of 61.  Steve Finn  was top
wicket-taker with 4-75.  South Africa started the day 262-7 and added 8 more runs
before Stuart Broad had  Dale Steyn  caught behind for 26. Morne
Morkel got 25 before wicketkeeper Matt Prior took a diving, one-
handed catch off Finn. Philander was stumped by Prior attempting
a heave.  England needs to win the match to avoid losing the top spot
in the International Cricket Council’s Test rankings to South
Africa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
