Wheat prices advanced for a third
day in  Chicago , limiting the extent of a second weekly loss as
falling supplies from  Russia  may boost demand for grain from the
U.S. and the European Union.  December-delivery wheat rose as much as 1.1 percent to
$8.9125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade before trading at
$8.8925 at 12:29 p.m. Paris time, set for a 1.3 percent weekly
loss. Milling wheat for November delivery traded in the French
capital rose 0.5 percent to 261.50 euros ($323.42) a metric ton.  Russia’s exportable grain surplus in the 2012-13 season
may be 12 million tons, 1 million tons less than estimated two
weeks ago, according to ZAO Rusagrotrans, the country’s biggest
rail transporter of cereals. All the grain may be shipped by the
end of 2012, the company estimates.  “Because of the expected decline in export availability
from the  Black Sea , wheat from U.S. and European origin should
find a place of choice this season,” Paris-based farm adviser
Agritel wrote in a market report today.  Russian grain stockpiles held by large agricultural
producers, procurement companies and millers fell 15 percent
from a year earlier as of Aug. 1, the government said.  December-delivery corn lost as much as 0.6 percent to $8.03
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $8.06 a
bushel, poised for a 0.4 percent loss this week. Futures, which
reached a record $8.49 on Aug. 10, are up 25 percent this year,
after the worst drought in half a century parched crops.  U.S. export sales from the new harvest slumped to 130,602
tons in the week to Aug. 9, from 928,277 tons a week
earlier, the Department of Agriculture said in a report
yesterday. Sales of the  old crop  fell 30 percent, it said. The
USDA on Aug. 10 said domestic corn output will drop 13 percent
to a six-year low of 10.78 billion bushels this year.  Soybeans for November delivery rose 0.5 percent to $16.335
a bushel, heading for a weekly decline of 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
