President Narayana Kocherlakota said he believes the  Federal
Open Market Committee  has gone too far by pledging to hold the
main interest rate near zero at least through late 2014.  “I would not have chosen to put that date as far out as
the committee has chosen,” Kocherlakota said in response to an
audience question after a speech today in Williston, North
Dakota.  The policy-setting FOMC repeated on Aug. 1 that it expects
economic conditions to warrant unusually low interest rates,
while saying it’s prepared if necessary to increase stimulus to
reduce unemployment. Policy makers are next scheduled to meet
Sept. 12-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
