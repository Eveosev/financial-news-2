Spotify Ltd. was sued by Nonend
Inventions NV over technology that allows Spotify users to get
music from the streaming service and other subscribers.  Netherlands-based Nonend accuses Spotify of “making,
using, offering to sell, and selling streaming music services to
users which incorporate methodologies that infringe one or more
claims” of certain patents, according to court papers filed in
federal court in  Delaware .  Closely held Spotify said in November it had 10 million
registered users worldwide, and 3 million paying subscribers.
Spotify July 31 said 5 million more subscribers signed up for
its ad-supported music service since January, with expansion
into countries including Australia and New Zealand.  Spotify has content agreements with  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s Sony
Music,  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Universal Music,  EMI Group (EMIS)  and Warner Music
Group. Under those agreements, artists, record companies and
publishers receive a cut of ad sales and subscriber fees.  Graham James, spokesman for Spotify, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment about the lawsuit.  The case is Nonend Inventions NV v. Spotify USA Inc., 1:12-
cv-01041, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
