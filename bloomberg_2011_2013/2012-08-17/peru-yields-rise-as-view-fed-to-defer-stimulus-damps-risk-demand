Yields on Peru’s sol-denominated
bonds rose to a two-week high as speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will defer additional stimulus for the world’s largest economy
damped demand for emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent bond due
in August 2020 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 4.62 percent at 12:57 p.m. in Lima, extending the
week’s advance to three basis points, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price declined 0.15 centimo to 121.14
centimos per sol.  In the U.S., the index of leading economic indicators
climbed more than forecast in July, and  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly improved this month, signs of sustained expansion.
European stocks rose to a 13-month high amid optimism policy
makers will take steps to protect the region’s banks.  “The mood is slightly more positive in  Europe  and in the
U.S. the situation isn’t catastrophic either,” weakening the
case for additional stimulus, said Alberto Jabiles, a trader at
 BBVA Banco Continental  in Lima.  The bond’s yield fell to 4.53 percent on Aug. 2, its lowest
since at least 2006, as speculation the Fed will step up bond
purchases to spur growth boosted demand for emerging-market
debt.  The sol was little changed at 2.6130 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The currency earlier
touched 2.6110, which  data  from Peru’s financial regulator show
is the strongest level since 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
