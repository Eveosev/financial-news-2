Orascom Development Holding AG (ODHN) , the
hotel and construction company controlled by Egyptian
businessman  Samih Sawiris , fell the most in more than two months
after saying its first-half loss may more than double.  The company, based in the Altdorf,  Switzerland , declined as
much as 1.1 Swiss francs, or 6.9 percent, to 14.75 francs in
Zurich, and traded at 14.90 francs as of 10:23 a.m. That gave
the company a market value of about 425 million Swiss francs
($437 million).  Higher construction costs, tax payments and the impairment
of some investments in associates will lead to a first-half loss
that Orascom said will be in the range of 20 million francs to
30 million francs, according to a statement today. The company
lost 13.7 million francs a year earlier.  Chairman and majority owner Sawiris has loaned the company
75 million francs and guaranteed as much as 50 million in
additional bank financing, as the builder fights to recover from
low sales in  Egypt  because of political unrest. Egypt
contributed 70 percent to Orascom Developmentâ€™s 2010 sales.  The company will report full first-half results on August
29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
