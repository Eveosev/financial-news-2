Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led Czech shares
to the highest in four months as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
signaled support for the European Central Bank’s plan to stem
the region’s debt crisis, boosting demand for riskier assets.  The stock rose 1.9 percent to 408 koruna by 11:42 a.m. in
Prague, adding to a 3.8 percent rally yesterday and headed for
its steepest two-day gain in six weeks. The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity
index, in which the Austrian bank has a 21 percent weighting,
rose 0.5 percent to 945.60, the highest since April 5.  European stocks, the euro and Spanish bonds gained before
U.S. data that may show the index of leading economic indicators
in the world’s largest economy rebounded in July. Merkel said
yesterday in Ottawa the ECB’s insistence on conditionality in
return for helping cut borrowing costs for indebted governments
matches her priorities. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
earlier objected to ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s proposals.  “Investors have recently been concerned about the mounting
split between Draghi and Bundesbank’s chief Weidmann or members
of the German ruling coalition,” analysts at Cyrrus brokerage
in Brno, Czech Republic, wrote in a report today. “Merkel’s
more reconciliatory attitude has largely dispersed these
concerns.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
