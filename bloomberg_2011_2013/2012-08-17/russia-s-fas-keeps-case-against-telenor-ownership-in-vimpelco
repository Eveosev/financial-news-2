Russia’s Anti-Monopoly Service said
it’s not ready to withdraw its case against  Telenor ASA (TEL) , the
Nordic company that increased its stake in  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)   Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s Altimo, which owns a
40.5 percent stake in VimpelCom, had complained to the Russian
regulator, known as FAS, after Telenor bought 11.3 percent of
the world’s sixth-biggest mobile phone provider from Weather
Investments II in February, initiating the dispute.  Altimo boosted its stake in VimpelCom this week as it seeks
to reach the same level of ownership as Telenor, which has 43
percent of the voting rights, Altimo Vice President Evgeny
Dumalkin said by phone on Aug. 15. The transaction will put an
end to the ownership dispute, Telenor said.  “As for the withdrawal of the claim, we believe it’s too
early to talk about it,” Ekaterina Zubova, spokeswoman at FAS,
said by e-mail from Moscow today. The FAS is “satisfied” with
its talks with Telenor, as well as with its talks with Altimo,
she wrote in the e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
