Eni SpA (ENI) , a partner in  Kazakhstan ’s
biggest oilfield, and state-owned KazMunaiGaz National Co. won
government approval to build a 43 billion-tenge ($288 million)
shipyard on the  Caspian Sea .  The shipyard will be able to maintain as many as 70 ships a
year and build new vessels with deadweight capacity of as much
as 15,000 metric tons, Astana-based KazMunaiGaz said today in an
e-mailed statement, after the partners’ feasibility study was
approved. The shipyard construction in Kuryk on the Kazakh shore
of the Caspian Sea is part of the state’s industrial program
through 2014, the state oil producer said.  Eni will help to arrange financing of the project, said
KazMunaiGaz, which is a partner with Eni in the Kashagan
oilfield. The company didn’t say when construction of the
shipyard will start and what share of the venture will belong to
the Italian oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
