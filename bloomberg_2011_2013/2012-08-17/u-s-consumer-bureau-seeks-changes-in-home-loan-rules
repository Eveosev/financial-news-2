U.S. lenders would be required to
offer the option of home loans without points or fees under  a
proposal  by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau designed to
allow borrowers to better compare prices.  The rule, released under the Dodd-Frank Act, would also
require that borrowers who choose to pay an upfront point or fee
receive an actual reduction in  interest rates , the agency said
in a statement today. The points or fees should serve to reduce
a consumer’s monthly loan payments, the CFPB said.  “Consumers have a hard time comparing loans when they are
dealing with a bewildering array of points and fees,”  Richard Cordray , CFPB director, said in the statement. “We want to
provide consumers with clearer options and enable them to choose
the loan that they believe is right for them.”  The agency, created in 2010 by Dodd-Frank, intends to
complete the regulations by January. The regulations would also
set standards for mortgage originators, including requiring
screening for felony convictions.  For Related News and Information:  Editors:  Lawrence Roberts , Gregory Mott  To contact the reporter on this story:
