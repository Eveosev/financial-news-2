Iraq will increase its daily exports
of Basrah Light crude from the  Persian Gulf  by 6 percent in the
second half of August compared with the previous two weeks, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The  nation  will ship 23 cargoes from the Basrah Oil
Terminal, compared with 20 in the first half of this month,
according to the plan. Exports will total 35.72 million barrels,
or 2.23 million barrels a day, compared with 2.11 million a day
two weeks earlier.  The program for the second half of August comprises 14
consignments of 2 million barrels each, six 1 million-barrel
shipments, and one lot each of 715,000, 556,000 and 444,000
barrels.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
