Orix Corp. (8591) , a Japanese finance and
leasing company, plans to spend 54 billion yen ($680 million) on
solar projects worth 200 megawatts in the next three years.  Orix will invest 30 billion yen to build solar power
stations with a total capacity of 100 megawatts, Tamaki Shibata,
a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based company, said today. A further
24 billion yen will be spent to lease rooftop space from
factories and warehouses for the installation of panels to
produce 100 megawatts of capacity, she said.  The plans come after  Japan  introduced an incentive program
for clean energy including solar and wind in July. Feed-in
tariffs require utilities to pay above-market rates to producers
of clean energy with the added costs passed to consumers as
surcharges.  Shibata confirmed a report today in the Tokyo Shimbun that
said the company may increase the investment to a total of 100
billion yen to build as much as 400 megawatts of capacity.  “We will closely monitor panel and land prices,” she
said.  The government set the feed-in tariff for solar at 42 yen
per kilowatt-hour for 20 years, about triple the 14.59 yen per
kilowatt-hour industrial users paid for electricity in the 12
months ended in March.  Orix is developing a 2 megawatt solar plant in Kagawa
prefecture scheduled to begin operating as early as January,
according to the spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
