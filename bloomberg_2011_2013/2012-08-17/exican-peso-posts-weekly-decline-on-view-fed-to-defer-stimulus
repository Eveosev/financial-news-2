Mexico’s peso posted its first five-
day decline in four weeks on speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will defer additional stimulus for the Latin American nation’s
biggest trading partner.  The currency has fallen 0.3 percent since Aug. 10, its
first weekly drop since the period ended July 20. The peso
appreciated 0.4 percent to 13.1225 per  U.S. dollar  at 4 p.m. in
Mexico City.  Signs of an improving U.S. economy are supporting bets that
the Fed will hold off in September from a third round of bond
buying known as quantitative easing. Mexico’s northern neighbor
is the destination for 80 percent of its exports.  “The above-expected growth we’ve seen makes people think
that they’ll push back monetary stimulus,” Alejandro Padilla, a
strategist at Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said in a telephone
interview from  Mexico  City. “However, it’s not enough growth to
suggest the U.S. is going to recover at a much stronger pace.”  That is “putting the brakes on the peso’s appreciation,”
he said.  The currency has rallied 6.2 percent against the dollar in
2012, the biggest increase among the 16 most-traded counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
August index of U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly increased
to 73.6 from 72.3 in the prior month. The index of U.S. leading
economic indicators gained 0.4 percent in July after a revised
0.4 percent drop in the previous month, the New York-based
Conference Board reported.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 dropped one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.58 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price of the securities rose 0.06
centavo to 139.31 centavos per peso. The yields have increased
16 basis points since Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
