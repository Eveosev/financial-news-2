Japan’s government named Yasushi
Manago to be the finance ministry’s top official as part of its
annual personnel reshuffle, Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said.  Manago, chief of the ministry’s budget bureau, will lead
bureaucrats as the government doubles the  sales tax  to 10
percent to slow the expansion of the world’s largest public
debt. The tax hike was approved by the parliament this month.  Takehiko Nakao, the ministry’s top currency official, will
stay in the position and continue to oversee the country’s
foreign-exchange policy. Tatsuo Yamasaki, deputy head of the
international bureau, will be promoted to bureau chief and
support Nakao. Yamasaki was director of the ministry’s currency
market division from 2002 to 2004, when authorities sold 39
trillion yen.  Mitsuhiro Furusawa, who had been dispatched to the
 International Monetary Fund , will head the ministry’s financial
bureau, which supervises the country’s debt issuance. Yasushi
Kinoshita will lead the budget bureau and Kazuho Tanaka will
head the tax bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
