China  State Grid Corp., the nation’s
largest energy provider, bought four pumped-storage units from
 Germany ’s Voith GmbH for a renewable-power plant in Jiangxi
province.  The plant will generate 2,400 megawatts once built, the
Heidenheim-based supplier said today in a statement, valuing the
order at 70 million euros ($86 million). The facility will store
power generated from renewable sources and release it through
turbines during periods of high demand.  “Pumped-storage plants are the only proven, economically
attractive technology for storing electricity from other
renewable sources,” Roland Munch, chief executive officer of
Voith Hydro, said in the statement.  China, the world’s biggest carbon emitter, has 24 pumped-
storage plants, with a total installed capacity of about 18,700
megawatts. Beijing aims to generate 11 percent of its energy
from renewable sources by 2015 and 20 percent by 2020.  Voith also won a 16 million-euro contract to refurbish a
pumped-storage plant in  Austria , it said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
