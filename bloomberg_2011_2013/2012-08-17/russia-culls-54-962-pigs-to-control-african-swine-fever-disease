Russia  culled and destroyed 54,962
pigs in the west of the country to contain an outbreak of the
deadly porcine disease African Swine Fever, the World
Organisation for  Animal Health  reported.  Pigs were culled at 11 locations in July and August after
pigs died from the disease at a dozen farms and villages, based
on a  notification  from Russia’s Ministry of Agriculture to the
Paris-based animal-health organization published online today.  African Swine Fever is harmless to people, and caused by a
virus for which there is no vaccine. The disease may have been
introduced in the region in 2007 when pigs at a dump in the
Black Sea port of Poti ate garbage from a ship,  the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization says.  The culls included 32,864 pigs at the Zavolzhskoye farm in
the village of Zavolzhskoe in Tver Oblast, and 13,886 swine at
the Gerba farm in Mingrelskaya, Krasnodar Krai, according to the
OIE notice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
