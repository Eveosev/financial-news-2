Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil producer, and miner  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  led borrowers
selling at least $35 billion in dollar-denominated bonds this
week as relative yields narrowed to the lowest level in a year.  While sales fell from $39.2 billion in the five days ended
Aug. 10, the busiest period since March, issuance exceeded the
weekly 2012 average of $26.6 billion, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demand to hold corporate
bonds rather than government debt narrowed 3 basis points to 265
basis points, or 2.65 percentage points, the lowest since Aug.
3, 2011, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
Corporate & High Yield index.  “Spreads are just so incredibly tight that anybody who
wants to issue, or thinks they should issue, is issuing,” said
Jody Lurie, a Philadelphia-based corporate credit analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. “It’s that whole concept of not
wanting to wait.”  Companies took advantage of borrowing costs at about record
lows, uncertain whether the  Federal Reserve  will undertake a
third round of asset purchases to reduce borrowing costs as the
U.S. housing market shows signs of improvement. In Europe, the
German and French economies slowed less than expected.  Yields Rise  Yields rose 9 basis points to 4.01 percent yesterday, the
first time they’ve exceeded 4 percent since an unprecedented
fall below that level on July 18, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. Yields reached a record-low 3.9 percent Aug. 2.  Sales of investment-grade debt were $23.8 billion this
week, down from $26.7 billion in the five days ended Aug. 10 and
compared with a 2012 weekly average of $20.6 billion, Bloomberg
data show.  Shell raised $2.5 billion in a three-part sale with its
first bond offering since 2010, Bloomberg data show. The
company, which is based in The Hague, sold $1 billion each of
1.125 percent, five-year notes and 2.375 percent, 10-year bonds,
and $500 million of 3.625 percent, 30-year debt.  Rio Tinto , the world’s third-largest miner, issued $3
billion in bonds in the London- and Melbourne-based company’s
second sale this year, including $1.25 billion of 1.625 percent,
five-year notes at a spread of 93 basis points, Bloomberg data
show.  BHP Billiton  and Vale SA are the two biggest mining
companies.  Yields on investment-grade debt reached 3.18 percent
yesterday, an 11 basis-point increase from 3.07 percent on Aug.
10, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
Corporate Master index. Spreads decreased 1 basis point to 186
basis points. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Speculative-Grade Sales  New-home construction in the U.S. fell in July, while the
number of building permits jumped to the highest level in four
years, indicating the industry may keep improving in the second
half of the year. Building permits, a proxy for future
construction, rose to an 812,000 pace, the most since August
2008.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro-area fell 0.2
percent in the second quarter from the first, when it stagnated,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said Aug.
14.  Germany ’s economy grew 0.3 percent, compared with
economists’ forecast of 0.2 percent, and  France ’s economy
stalled for a third straight quarter, better than an estimated
0.1 percent contraction.  High-yield offerings of $11.2 billion this week are down
from $14.5 billion in the five days ended Aug. 10 and compare
with a weekly average of $5.9 billion this year, Bloomberg data
show. The sales helped bring August issuance of $30.5 billion to
the highest on record for the month.  DaVita Offering  Yields on junk debt were unchanged this week at 7.42
percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. Spreads
decreased 9 basis points to 589 basis points.  DaVita Inc., the dialysis services provider whose biggest
shareholder is billionaire  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., sold $1.25 billion of 5.75 percent, 10-year bonds at a
relative yield of 404 basis points, Bloomberg data show.
Proceeds will help the company fund its $4.4 billion acquisition
of HealthCare Partners.  “We’re seeing very healthy, strong flows into high-yield
bond funds and ETFs,”  James Kochan , chief fixed-income
strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management LLC in  Menomonee
Falls ,  Wisconsin  said in a telephone interview. “There is money
to be put to work and the issuers know that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
