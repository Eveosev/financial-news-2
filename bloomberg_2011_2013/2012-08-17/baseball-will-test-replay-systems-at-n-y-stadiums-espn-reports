Major League Baseball  will test two
replay systems at  New York  stadiums this month for possible
future use in reviewing fair and foul balls, ESPN reported.  The “Hawkeye” system used in tennis will be tested at
Citi Field during New York Mets games in September and on days
off, while a radar-based system similar to those used to trace
shots during pro golf events will be tested at Yankee Stadium,
 ESPN said , citing unidentified MLB officials.  An e-mail seeking comment from MLB spokesman Pat Courtney
wasn’t immediately returned.  The systems also will be tested during the  Arizona  Fall
League before being presented at major-league owners’ meetings,
though there’s no timetable on deciding when or if to implement
them, ESPN said.  The latest collective bargaining agreement between MLB and
its players’ union allows for the implementation of replays for
fair/foul calls and to determine whether a ball is caught or
trapped. Baseball Commissioner  Bud Selig  has said he would like
to expand replay as early as next season, ESPN said. Video
reviews currently are used on home runs to determine if the ball
cleared the wall, was fair or foul and whether there was fan
interference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
