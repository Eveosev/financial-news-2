On Aug. 6, 1964, Donald Currey was
at the timberline of  Nevada ’s Wheeler Peak looking for
bristlecone pines, the oldest trees on earth.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  A graduate student, he was working on a climate timeline,
and the trees held valuable data. Using a Swedish borer, Currey
took samples from trunks without harming the pines.  His 114th specimen had a 252-inch circumference and was so
tough it broke his regular borer and the backup. The Forest
Service gave him permission to get out his chain saw and cut the
tree down.  It turned out to be “Prometheus,” more than 5,000 years
old, and known to conservationists as the most ancient living
thing on earth. A sapling when the Sumerians created mankind’s
first written language, it had now been pointlessly destroyed.  I spoke with Eric Rutkow, author of “American Canopy:
Trees, Forests and the Making of a Nation,” on the following
topics:  1. Virgin Forests  2. Commodification  3. Founding Fathers  4. Conservation  5. American Backwoods Heroes  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
