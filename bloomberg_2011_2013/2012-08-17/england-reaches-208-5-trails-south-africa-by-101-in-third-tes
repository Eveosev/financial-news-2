England reached 208-5 after bowling
out South Africa for 309 on day two of the third and final
cricket Test at Lord’s in London.  Jonny Bairstow was 72 not out, with Matt Prior on 22, at
stumps for England, which must win to avoid losing the top spot
in the world rankings to South Africa.  South Africa started the day 262-7 and added eight more
runs before  Stuart Broad  had  Dale Steyn  caught behind for 26.
 Steven Finn , who finished 4-75, got Morne Morkel, and Graeme Swann ended Vernon Philander’s career-high innings at 61.  England’s poor start with the bat matched the visitors’
effort yesterday with both teams slumping to 54-4 before staging
recoveries.  Morkel bowled captain  Andrew Strauss , playing in his 100th
career Test, for 20. Then Steyn got two successive wickets,
claiming Jonathan Trott and Alistair Cook, and James Taylor fell
for 10 off Morkel.  Ian Bell and Bairstow steadied the hosts by putting on 124
for the fifth wicket before Philander dismissed Bell for 58.
Bairstow and Prior then added 30 runs to see the day through.  Bairstow’s innings is a boost for the England management
after he was selected to replace  Kevin Pietersen , who was
omitted from the team following a controversy over text messages
the South African-born batsmen sent to opposing players. The
texts contained “less than flattering” comments about Strauss
and his teammates, the Daily Mail reported.  Bairstow brought up his 50 with a cut behind square off the
wicket for four off Morkel. The landmark had Strauss up on his
feet and applauding from the England balcony.  England needs a victory to remain No. 1 in the
International Cricket Council’s Test rankings, while a draw is
enough for South Africa to leapfrog the hosts. The Proteas won
the first Test by an innings and 12 runs with the second rain-
affected game drawn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
