U.S. stocks rose, sending benchmark
indexes to near the highest levels in more than four years, amid
better-than-forecast economic data. Treasuries halted a four-day
drop, pulling 10-year yields down from a three-month high.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2 percent to
1,418.16, less than one point below its highest closing level
since May 2008, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly
topped its best close since December 2007. Rates on 10-year
notes lost two basis points to 1.81 percent after yesterday
climbing as high as 1.86 percent, matching their  200-day moving
average . The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose to a 13-month high and
Spain’s bonds rallied as concern over the debt crisis eased.  Better-than-forecast data on consumer confidence and
leading economic indicators weren’t enough to send the  S&P 500 
above 1,419.04, its four-year high reached in April. Treasuries
still fell for a fourth week, the longest streak since 2010, as
improving data reduced demand for the safety of  U.S. debt . In
Europe, speculation grew that policy makers will take steps to
protect the region’s  banks , helping the Stoxx 600 extend its
rebound from a June low to 17 percent.  “Today’s data is just a couple more pieces of the puzzle
that show improvement, but not all that great,” Terry L.
Morris, who helps oversee about $2.5 billion at Wyomissing,
Pennsylvania-based National Penn Investors Trust Co., said in a
phone interview. “The general attitude is optimistic, maybe
more optimism than the market should have.”  Market Leaders   Trading of S&P 500 companies was about 13 percent below the
30-day average and the index swung no more than 0.29 percent
from its high to its low of the session, the smallest
fluctuation since 2006.  The Dow climbed 25.09 points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,275.20
and rose  as high as  13,281.32.   Gap Inc. (GPS)  and J.M. Smucker Co. jumped at least 4.8 percent
after  earnings  topped analyst estimates. Apple Inc. rose to a
record $648.11 and exceeded $600 billion in market value for the
first time after Jefferies & Co. said the company had started
production of the iPad mini, a smaller version of its popular
tablet.  Marvell Technology Group Ltd. slumped 14 percent after
predicting profit that fell short of forecasts.  As the S&P 500 approached its highest level since 2008, the
cost of using options to protect against declines in the
benchmark index slid to a five-year low. The Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index, the benchmark for U.S.
options known as the VIX, sank 5.9 percent to 13.45 today, its
lowest level since June 2007.  Economy Data  Today’s reports on U.S.  consumer confidence  and leading
economic indicators added to optimism about the economy after
data this week that showed retail sales jumped more than
expected and applications for building  permits  rose to the
highest since August 2008.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
August index of consumer sentiment increased to 73.6, the
highest level since May, from 72.3 the prior month. The gauge
was projected to be little changed at 72.2, according to the
median forecast of 72 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months increased 0.4 percent after a revised 0.4
percent drop in June, the New York-based group said today.
Economists projected the gauge would rise by 0.2 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Thirty-year yields today slipped two basis points to 2.93
percent, while rates on two-year debt lost less than one basis
point to 0.29 percent.  European Markets  The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  climbed 1.1 percent over five days to cap an
11th straight weekly gain, its longest rally since January 2006.
Bankinter SA and Bankia SA rallied more than 2 percent on
speculation the European Union will disburse the first
installment of a 100 billion-euro ($124 billion) bailout
facility to Spain’s lenders.  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  jumped 3.1
percent as the biggest Swiss life insurer’s first-half  profit 
exceeded analysts’ estimates  Spanish bonds outperformed all their euro-area peers today,
with the nation’s 10-year yield falling eight basis points to
6.44 percent. The rate lost 46 basis points this week, the
biggest decline since the five days through July 27. Spain’s
two-year yield dropped 22 basis points to 3.77 percent today.  Yield Watch  The two-year yield may fall to as low as 2 percent should
the ECB buy debt through its bond-purchase program, said  Steven Major , head of fixed-income research at HSBC Holdings Plc in
 London .  “It’s all about getting those front-end yields stapled to
the floor,” Major said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “The Pulse” with  Maryam Nemazee .  German 10-year yields slipped three basis points to 1.50
percent.  Australia ’s dollar declined against 15 of its 16 major
peers, weakening 0.9 percent versus the U.S. currency, after the
nation’s Treasury said the central bank would be able to ease
monetary policy if the currency’s gains are hurting the economy.  The S&P GSCI  gauge  of 24 commodities was little changed
after a three-day rally, with lead, cocoa and wheat leading
gains and gasoline,  Brent crude  and heating oil falling the
most.  Oil for September delivery rose 41 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $96.01 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the
highest settlement since May 11, amid rising tension in the
 Middle East . The price is up 9 percent in August and 13 percent
in the third quarter.  Platinum Rallies  Platinum for October delivery jumped as much as 2.8 percent
to $1,475.30 an ounce, the highest since July 6, after 34 people
were killed at  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana platinum mine in  South
Africa , according to the country’s police commissioner.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  fell 0.4 percent, capping
its first weekly drop in five weeks. South Korea’s Kospi Index
lost 0.6 percent, with shares in South Africa,  Poland  and  Taiwan 
declining. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland
companies added 0.9 percent, and Turkey’s benchmark gauge
climbed 1.3 percent.  India ’s Sensex rose 0.2 percent, while
