Coffee exports from  Nicaragua 
climbed 17 percent last month from a year earlier, according to
the country’s Center for Export Procedures, known as Cetrex.  Shipments totaled about 146,823 bags of 60 kilograms (132
pounds) in July, up from 125,787 bags in the same period last
year, Cetrex said in a  report  on its website.  Nicaragua will produce 1.6 million bags of coffee in the
2011-12 season that ends on Sept. 30, data from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture show. Output will rise to 1.8 million
bags in 2012-13, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
