Berlin-based Internet-development
company Rocket Internet is shutting down its offices in  Turkey 
and began firing some of its 400 workers today, Turkish
technology blog Webrazzi reported.  The company may sell off some of its web businesses in the
country, Webrazzi said, citing a Rocket executive it didn’t
name. No reason was given for the exit.  Rocket, owned by German brothers Oliver, Marc and Alexander Samwer, generally copies promising Internet businesses in the
U.S. and offers them internationally. The company’s Zappos.com
Inc. clone, Zalando GmbH, is estimated to be worth $1 billion by
Financial Times Deutschland.  The company’s venture capital fund, European Founders Fund,
invested in European knockoffs of Facebook Inc. and  Google
Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube, which sold for $112 million and $36 million,
respectively.  Andreas Winiarski, head of public relations for Rocket in
 Germany , did not immediately respond to calls or an e-mail
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
