Republican vice presidential
candidate  Paul Ryan  paid effective federal tax rates of 20
percent in 2011 and 15.9 percent in 2010, tax returns released
last night show.  In 2011, Ryan and his wife, Janna, paid $64,764 in federal
taxes on $323,416 of adjusted gross income. In 2010, the Ryans
paid $34,233 in taxes on $215,417 of adjusted gross income.  Over the past two years, they’ve donated a total of about
$15,500 to charities including the Boy Scouts of America and St.
John Vianney Parish in Janesville,  Wisconsin , their hometown.  Presumed Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney 
announced Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, as his running mate on
Aug. 11. The Ryan returns were released by Romney’s campaign.  Romney so far has released only his 2010 returns, which
showed he and his wife Ann paid a 13.9 percent effective federal
tax rate on more than $21 million in income.  The tax rate paid by the Ryans topped Romney’s for that
year, in part because a much larger share of income for the
Ryans came from wages, rather than investments taxed at lower
rates. The top marginal income tax rate is 35 percent while
 capital gains  are taxed at 15 percent.  In 2011, Ryan reported $153,359 in wages, $33,153 in
capital gains and $29,987 in dividends. Another $116,043 came
from “rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S
corporations, trusts, etc.” Among the itemized deductions the
Ryans claimed in 2011 was $16,143 in mortgage interest.  ‘Several’ Years  The previous year, Ryan reported $153,741 in wages as well
as $26,052 in dividends and $3,135 in capital gains. Another
$39,013 came from “rental real estate, royalties, partnerships,
S corporations, trusts, etc.”  Though Ryan said he gave Romney “several” years of tax
returns during his vice-presidential vetting process, the
filings released last night matched the number of returns Romney
has said he’s willing to make public. The former Massachusetts
governor has pledged to release his 2011 return when it is
completed, while rejecting calls from Democrats and some
Republicans that he release additional years of returns.  Under pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to
release more information about his personal finances, Romney
said on Aug. 16 that he has reviewed his returns “and over the
past 10 years, I never paid less than 13 percent.” He also said
that “if you add, in addition, the amount that goes to charity,
why, the number gets well above 20 percent.”  Obama Offer  President  Barack Obama ’s re-election campaign earlier
yesterday called on Romney to release at least five years of
returns, saying it would let the issue rest if he did so.  Romney’s campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, rebuffed the
offer, responding that “it is clear that President Obama wants
nothing more than to talk about Governor Romney’s tax returns
instead of the issues that matter to voters, like putting
Americans back to work, fixing the economy and reining in
spending.”  The average household paid 17.4 percent in all federal
taxes in 2009, according to the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget
Office . That figure includes all federal levies, such as the
Social Security payroll tax.  Obama and his wife, Michelle, paid 20.5 percent in federal
taxes on $789,674 in adjusted gross income for 2011.  Vice President Joseph Biden and his wife, Jill, reported
paying $87,900 in federal taxes for 2011 on $379,035 in adjusted
gross income for a 23.2 percent rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
