Germany “must end” its purchases
of client information stolen from Swiss banks, German Foreign
Minister  Guido Westerwelle  told  Bilanz .  The practice of buying “stolen property” to trace tax
evaders is “questionable,” Westerwelle told the Zurich-based
magazine. A Swiss-German tax treaty should be ratified as soon
as possible, Westerwelle was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
