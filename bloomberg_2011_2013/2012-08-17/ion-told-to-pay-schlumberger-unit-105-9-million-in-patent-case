ION Geophysical Corp. fell the most
in a year after it was told to pay $105.9 million for infringing
patents owned by  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) ’s WesternGeco unit over
equipment that provides underwater seismic data.  Ion, an oilfield services provider, fell 88 cents or 11
percent to $6.89 in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading,
the biggest one-day  drop  since Aug. 8, 2011. Earlier, it fell as
much as 16 percent.  A federal jury in Houston yesterday said Ion should pay a
royalty of $12.5 million and compensate WesternGeco $93.4
million for its lost profits. The jury also found that the
infringement was intentional, so WesternGeco can ask for the
damage award to be increased. It also can seek an order blocking
Ion from further use of the invention.  The four-week trial targeted Ion’s DigiFin lateral-streamer
control system. Houston-based Ion said it would take “immediate
steps to pursue all available legal options to overturn the
verdict,” according to a company statement.  Oil companies  pay more than $15 million for surveys to
determine the likelihood of underwater oil or gas pockets. The
surveys are done using streamers that pick up sound waves and
stretch six miles behind a survey boat.  WesternGeco pioneered technology more than a decade ago for
ways to control where the streamers are positioned to get better
images and consistent results, said Gregg LoCascio of  Kirkland &
Ellis  in  Washington , who represented WesternGeco in the trial.  Protecting Technology  The verdict “reaffirms our commitment to protect the
technological innovation and advancement in our Q-Marine
Products,” WesternGeco President Carel Hooykaas said in a
statement.  WesternGeco filed its complaint in 2009, claiming that
Ion’s marine seismic-streaming steering devices infringed its
patents. Ion, which denied infringing the patents and challenged
their validity, said in its annual report it has accused
WesternGeco of trying to restrict competition in the market for
marine seismic surveys.  “We respect the legal process but remain convinced that
WesternGeco’s patents are invalid and that we do not infringe,”
Ion Chief Executive Officer Brian Hanson said in the statement.
“We developed our own technology utilized in DigiFin and in
fact have our own patents covering DigiFin and other inventions
related to lateral steering.”  DigiFin sales account for about 3 percent of projected
revenue for the year. Hanson said the verdict would have minimal
impact on revenue in the second half of the year. Ion has
sufficient inventory for customers through this year and would
make operational changes to ensure that DigiFin remains
available to customers over the long term, he said.  Schlumberger, based in Houston and Paris, is the world’s
largest oilfield-services provider.  The case is WesternGeco LLC v.  ION Geophysical Corp. (IO) ,
09cv1827, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of  Texas
