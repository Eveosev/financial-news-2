Russian authorities proposed that
 Josef Ackermann , former  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  chief executive
officer, join the country’s new financial agency that would
manage sovereign wealth funds, Vedomosti  said , citing several
unidentified Russian bankers.  Ackermann, who stepped down from his post in Deutsche Bank
in May, may join the agency’s board of directors or even head
it, the newspaper said. The agency, known as Rosfinagentstvo,
may be created in 2013 and is expected to manage the Reserve
Fund, the National Wellbeing Fund and part of state debts that
include OFZ bonds and Eurobonds, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
