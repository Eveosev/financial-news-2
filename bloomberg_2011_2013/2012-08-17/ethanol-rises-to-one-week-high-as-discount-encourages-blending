Ethanol futures rose to a one-week
high in  Chicago  on speculation the fuel’s discount to gasoline
will encourage increased use.  Prices gained as refiners stand to take advantage of a
43.75-cent  discount  to gasoline. The motor fuel’s premium to the
additive has more than tripled from its 2012 low of 15.6 cents
on July 17 as rising crude-oil prices sent gasoline futures up
6.4 percent. Ethanol is typically blended into gasoline at a
level of 10 percent.  “Blend spreads are pretty good with crude up here,” said
Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in
Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 0.3 cent to
settle at $2.59 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since Aug. 10. Prices have gained 18 percent this
year.  Babler said an influx of imports is placing a cap on how
much ethanol increases.  The U.S. imported 93,000 barrels of ethanol a day in the
week ended Aug. 10, up from none a year earlier, Energy
Department data show. It was the highest since the agency began
tracking weekly  data  for the biofuel in June 2010.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.63 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive
dropped 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.725, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slipped 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.63 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel added 0.5 cent to
$2.565.  To contact the reporter on this story:
