Canada ’s dollar fell against its
U.S. peer as crude oil, the nation’s biggest export, declined
and the government prepared to issue a report that may show the
country’s consumer price index was unchanged in July.  The Canadian currency headed for a sixth consecutive weekly
gain, its longest winning streak since 2010. Consumer prices
rose 1.5 last month from a year earlier, unchanged from June,
economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast before the data.  “There’s a little pessimism around CPI and whether that
number will meet expectations,” Blake Jespersen, managing
director of foreign exchange in Toronto at Bank of Montreal,
said in a telephone interview. “Generally speaking, the
Canadian dollar is still quite strong. Barring a disappointing
CPI, it will hang onto these gains today.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.2 percent to
98.82 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 8:16 a.m. in Toronto. It has
advanced 0.3 percent this week. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0119.  Crude oil for September delivery fell 0.3 percent to $95.32
a barrel in  New York , its first decline in four days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
