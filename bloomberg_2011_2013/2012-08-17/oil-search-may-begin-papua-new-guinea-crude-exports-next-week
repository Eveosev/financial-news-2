Oil Search Ltd. (OSH)  may start exporting
crude as early as next week from  Papua New Guinea  after failing
to find leaks in its offshore loading terminal.  Testing at the Kumul Marine Terminal has “found no source
of any leak in the oil export system” and inspections will
continue over the next few days, according to  a release today .
Oil Search shut the terminal when droplets, totaling an
estimated 1 barrel of crude, were seen on the sea surface,
according to a July 26 release.  “Should this work confirm present conclusions, Oil Search
expects to return to normal operations early next week,” the
company said.  Oil Search’s Papua New Guinea operation was producing about
30,000 barrels a day and typically exporting two cargoes per
month before the incident, Ann Diamant, investor relations
manager, said in a phone interview Aug. 14.  Two crude tankers are anchored near the terminal, according
to data from  IHS Inc. (IHS)  on Bloomberg. The Singapore Voyager has
been in the area since Aug. 1, and the Vallombrosa since July
12, the data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
