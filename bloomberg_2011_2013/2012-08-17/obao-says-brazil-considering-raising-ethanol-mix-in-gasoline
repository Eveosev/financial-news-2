Brazil  is considering an increase
this year in the amount of ethanol added to gasoline, Energy
Minister Edison Lobao said, a move that could boost  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA’s (PETR4)   earnings.  The government is reviewing supplies of the biofuel to
determine if the measure can be implemented, Lobao said
yesterday.  “We are working with the possibility of increasing the mix
this year, at the end of the year,” Lobao told reporters in  Sao
Paulo . “We are in talks with producers and if they can give
solid guarantees of supply we have all the interest in
increasing the mix.”  Petrobras sells imported gasoline and diesel at less than
cost in Brazil. The price gap combined with a weaker currency
led the state company to post its first net loss since 1999 in
the second quarter. Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas
Foster said Aug. 3 that the company plans to bring domestic fuel
prices into line with international prices to improve profit.  Petrobras reported on Aug. 3 a  loss  of 1.35 billion reais
($670 million), compared with a 2.94 billion-real average profit
estimate among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company incurred losses of about 750 million reais from
fuel imports this year, said  Adriano Pires , head of the
Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, in a June 29 interview.
Increased ethanol levels could cut gas imports by 40 percent, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
