The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars held at the lowest level in more than a year,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 33.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
at 8:20 a.m. in  London . It reached as low as minus 32 basis
points yesterday, the cheapest since July 22, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 39 basis
points below Euribor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The three-month Eonia swap rose to the highest since Aug.
3. The swap was at eight basis points from 7.7 yesterday. The
European Banking Federationâ€™s euro overnight indexed average, or
Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.111 percent
yesterday, from 0.112 percent the day before.  Banks cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  to 322 billion euros ($398 billion)
yesterday from 351 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
