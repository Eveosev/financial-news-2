Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) ,  Switzerland ’s
biggest life insurer, gained the most in two weeks in Zurich
trading as first-half profit exceeded analyst estimates after
capital gains from selling euro-zone sovereign debt.  Swiss Life climbed as much as 4.1 percent and was 3.7
percent higher at 105.60 francs as of 9:48 a.m. in Zurich. The
stock has gained 22 percent this year, booting the insurer’s
market value to 3.39 billion Swiss francs ($3.5 billion).  Net income fell 11 percent to 360 million francs, the
Zurich-based insurer said today, beating the 304.8 million-franc
average  estimate  of nine  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. Capital
gains on investments rose eightfold to 1.17 billion francs after
Swiss Life sold about 7.8 billion francs of euro-zone debt and
switched mainly into U.S. Treasuries, according to Chief
Executive Officer Bruno Pfister.  “These are strong results,” said Daniel Bischof, a
Zurich-based analyst with Helvea. “The profit was driven by
more  capital gains .”  “We decided to reduce our sovereign exposure to euro-zone
debt on our Swiss balance sheet,” resulting in an investment
gain, said Pfister.  Swiss Life plans to make more savings after reducing annual
costs by 404 million francs since 2009 and cutting 520 jobs in
Switzerland. The insurer is also trying to reduce its dependency
on investment income and compensate for a decline in revenue
from selling life policies, known as wrappers, to wealthy
clients of Swiss private banks.  Tax Item  First-half profit declined after one-time tax revenue of 89
million francs in the year-earlier period due to the “disposal
of business activities” in prior years.  Swiss Life is targeting a return on equity of 10 percent to
12 percent this year from selling more pension products and a
new business margin of 2.2 percent.  Total gross written premiums fell 2.6 percent to 9.84
billion francs from a year earlier after declines in Germany and
 France . The insurer’s biggest unit in Switzerland saw gross
written premiums drop to 5.74 billion francs, while premium
income fell 8.6 percent in France.  Operating profit rose 17 percent to 528 million francs
because of higher income from investments.  AWD Holding AG, the German financial services broker that
Swiss Life acquired in 2008, contributed 13.1 million euros
($16.2 million) to group earnings in the first half, down from
21.8 million euros in the year-earlier period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
