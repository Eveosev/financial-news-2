Japan  will cap new bond sales at 44
trillion yen ($554 billion) next year and reduce public works
spending by 10 percent as it attempts to slow the expansion of
the world’s largest public debt burden.  The government also plans to limit general spending
excluding debt interest payments to 71 trillion yen for the year
starting April 1, according to budget guidelines approved by the
Cabinet in Tokyo today. The ceilings are the same as the ones
set for this year’s budget.  Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  this month won parliamentary
approval to double the nation’s sales tax to 10 percent by 2015
to help pay for rising social-welfare costs. Japan’s outstanding
debt issuance reached a record 976.2 trillion yen as of June 30,
the  Finance Ministry  said last week.  Social welfare costs are projected to increase by 800
billion yen in the next fiscal year, according to the statement.
The guidelines approved today are the framework for the nation’s
annual budget, which is usually compiled in December.  “Japan’s fiscal conditions are worsening seriously and if
we leave this problem as it is, concerns about the country’s
fiscal sustainability will mount and may cause extremely adverse
effects on the economy and the Japanese people’s life,” the
guideline said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
