Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , seeking to fend off
competition from Android devices in growth markets such as Asia,
said it plans to start offering two Zynga Inc. games on its
cheaper mobile phones.  “Draw Something” and “Zynga Poker” will be available as
free downloads for Nokia’s Asha touch-screen handsets this
quarter, according to a statement from the Espoo, Finland-based
phonemaker today.  Nokia is adding features to cheaper devices as ZTE Corp.,
Huawei Technologies Co. and other mobile-phone manufacturers
using  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system lure away users in
emerging markets such as India. Nokia, which has also ceded
market share in higher-priced smartphones, lost its lead as the
biggest mobile-phone maker by units this year.  For San Francisco-based  Zynga (ZNGA) , the agreement with Nokia
provides more than 100 million potential users. Zynga, the
biggest maker of games played on Facebook Inc.’s website, is
seeking growth in mobile devices as more users access the Web
using smartphones and tablets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
