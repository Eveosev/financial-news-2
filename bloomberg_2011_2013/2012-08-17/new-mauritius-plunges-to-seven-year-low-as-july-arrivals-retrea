New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the
country’s biggest leisure operator by market value, slumped to a
seven-year low after Statistics Mauritius announced tourism
arrivals fell in July.  The  stock  slid 1.7 percent to 58 rupees a share by 11:52
a.m. in Port Louis, the lowest since May 2005.  Arrivals declined 2.4 percent to 76,166 from a year ago,
the data agency said in a  statement  on its website today.
Tourists coming from  Europe  dropped 15 percent, led by a 30-
percent contraction from France, which is Mauritius’ biggest
market by country, it said.  New Mauritius, which owns and manages eight hotels under
the Beachcomber brand in the Indian Ocean island nation, slid 15
percent this month, the second-worst in the 39-member SEMDEX
index,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show. The gauge slipped 1.9
percent over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
