U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index approaching a four-year high, amid better-
than-estimated data on  consumer confidence  and leading
indicators and as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  climbed to a record.  Apple rose 1.9 percent, surpassing $600 billion in market
value, after Jefferies & Co. said the company had started
production of the iPad mini, a smaller version of its popular
tablet.  Gap Inc. (GPS)  and  J.M. Smucker (SJM)  Co. added at least 4.8 percent
as earnings topped estimates. Marvell Technology Group Ltd. lost
14 percent after predicting profit that fell short of forecasts.  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to 1,418.16 at 4 p.m. in  New
York , as swings in the S&P 500 narrowed to 0.3 percent, the
smallest daily change since November 2006. The benchmark index
is within one point of a four-year peak of 1,419.04 set on April
2. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 25.09 points, or 0.2
percent, to 13,275.20 after briefly surpassing its highest close
since 2007. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was
5.3 billion shares, 18 percent below the three-month average.  “We have surpassed most people’s expectations for what
stocks would do in June, July and August,” Rod Smyth, the
Richmond, Virginia-based chief investment strategist of
Riverfront Investment Group, which manages $3 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “Gradually people are succumbing and
putting money in.”  Economic Reports  Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly improved in
August, boosting the prospect of stronger household spending
this quarter, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment. The Conference
Board’s index of U.S. leading economic indicators, a gauge of
the outlook for the next three to six months, climbed more than
forecast in July.  The  S&P 500  added 0.9 percent this week for its sixth
weekly advance while the Dow is up 0.5 percent. Both measures
capped their longest winning streaks since January 2011.  Concern about Europe’s debt crisis and a slowdown in China
pushed the S&P 500 down as much as 9.9 percent from April
through June. The index has since rallied 11 percent amid
speculation global central banks will introduce further stimulus
measures. The  Stoxx Europe 600 (SXXP)  Index today climbed to a 13-month
high, extending gains for an 11th week.  Optimistic Attitude  “Today’s data are just a couple more pieces of the puzzle
that show improvement, but not all that great,” Terry L. Morris, who helps oversee about $2.5 billion at Wyomissing,
Pennsylvania-based National Penn Investors Trust Co., said in a
phone interview. “The general attitude is optimistic, maybe
more optimistic than the market should have.”  The S&P 500 yesterday broke out of a narrow trading range
after hovering around 1,400 for the past seven sessions. Trading
volume and volatility have dropped as vacationing traders
awaited policy clues from the  Federal Reserve ’s summit at the
end of the month and a European Central Bank meeting in
September.  About 5.8 billion shares a day changed hands in August, 14
percent lower than the daily mean in the first seven months of
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Chicago Board
Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , known as the VIX, fell 5.9
percent to 13.45 today, the lowest level since June 2007.  The S&P 500 Total Return index, which assumes dividends are
reinvested back into the gauge’s 500 stocks, climbed to a record
even as the regular S&P 500 remained about 9 percent below its
peak in 2007. The  S&P 100 Index (OEX) , a measure for the biggest
companies in the S&P 500, rose to the highest level since 2008.  Policy Uncertainty  “People are taking a high-quality, longer-term perspective
and may not be trading as much because of policy uncertainty,”
Jeff Schwarte, a  money manager  who helps oversee about $260
billion in Des Moines, Iowa, at Principal Global Investors, said
in a phone interview. “What investors are trying to balance
here is weaker economic data with the anticipation of a policy
response from China, Europe or the U.S.”  Technology, industrial and consumer discretionary companies
rose the most among  10 S&P 500 groups , climbing at least 0.5
percent. Health-care and energy stocks performed worst, erasing
more than 0.2 percent.  Apple Rallies  Apple increased 1.9 percent to $648.11, its highest level
ever. The tinier iPad may go on sale by October and a new
television could reach stores by 2013, according a research
report from  Peter Misek , an analyst at Jefferies.  Gap gained 4.8 percent to a 12-year high of $35.99. The
largest U.S. specialty-apparel retailer reported a 29 percent
rise in second-quarter profit, aided by domestic sales. The
company boosted its full-year earnings forecast.  J.M. Smucker jumped 5.1 percent to $82.96. The maker of
Folgers coffee reported first-quarter earnings excluding some
items of $1.17 a share. That topped the average analyst estimate
of $1 in a Bloomberg survey.  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  added 2.4 percent to $46.87, the highest level
since 2005. The world’s largest Internet marketplace was rated
“above average” in new coverage by Caris & Co., with a target
price of $52.  Ann Inc. (ANN)  rallied 20 percent to $33.89. The women’s clothing
retailer increased its full-year sales forecast as second-
quarter profit exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Marvell (MRVL)  dropped 14 percent to $10.54 for the biggest
retreat since 2006. The maker of chips for mobile phones and
communication and storage gear predicted third-quarter profit,
excluding certain costs, will be 24 cents a share, plus or minus
2 cents. Analysts, on average, expected 32 cents, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  McKesson Corp. (MCK)  slipped 2.5 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $86.42. The largest U.S. drug distributor was reduced to
equalweight from overweight at Morgan Stanley.  Facebook, Groupon  Facebook Inc. (FB)  slipped 4.1 percent to $19.05. The world’s
largest social-networking company sank  6.3 percent  yesterday for
the second-largest post-lock-up decline among companies that
have gone public since January 2011. The stock reached a record
low after a 60 percent increase in the number of shares
available for trading.  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  tumbled 5 percent to $4.75, the lowest level
since its debut in November. Evercore Partners Inc. downgraded
shares of the daily-deal website, citing a potential for
billings to decline.  Molycorp Inc. (MCP)  declined 12 percent to $9.84. The U.S. owner
of the largest rare-earth deposit outside of China raised $360
million, more than expected, selling shares and convertible
bonds to help fund construction at its mine in California.
