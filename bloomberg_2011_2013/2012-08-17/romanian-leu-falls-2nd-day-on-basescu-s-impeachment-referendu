Romania ’s leu weakened for a second
day before a  Constitutional Court  ruling on the presidential
impeachment next week which may worsen the country’s political
gridlock.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 4.4862 per euro at
5:15 p.m. in Bucharest, extending its loss this year to 3.7
percent, the second-worst among emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg after the Brazilian real. The leu is
heading for a 1.1 percent gain this week.  Romania’s Constitutional Court will meet on Aug. 21 to
debate whether a July 29 vote to impeach suspended President
Traian Basescu is valid. The power struggle between Basescu and
Prime Minister Victor Ponta in the past two months has pushed
the currency to record lows and boosted borrowing costs.  “The referendum ruling is a key Romania specific factor
for the leu and adds a lot of uncertainty about where it could
go next week,”  Koon Chow , an emerging-market strategist at
 Barclays Capital , said in an e-mail note today.  The central bank lent 5 billion lei ($1.4 billion) in one-
week repurchase agreements auction on Aug. 13, compared with
12.1 billion lei on July 30, according to the Bucharest-based
bank. Romania’s interbank offered rate, or ROBOR, rose to 6.22
percent yesterday, the highest in eight months.  Before a ruling, the court must check the number of
eligible voters in the country to decide whether a minimum
turnout threshold of half of the electorate was achieved. If the
referendum is invalidated on the turnout, Basescu will return to
his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
