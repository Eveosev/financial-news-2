Lithuanian inflation under European
Union methodology will probably quicken to 3.2 percent from a
year earlier in August, the  statistics office  said.  Consumer prices rose 2.9 percent in July, the statistics
office, based in the capital, Vilnius, said today in an e-mailed
statement. Prices may fall 0.1 percent from the previous month
on lower vegetable and clothing prices, it said.  Lithuania needs to slow inflation to qualify for planned
euro adoption in 2014. Countries seeking to make the currency
change must keep inflation at less than 1.5 percentage points
above the average of the three lowest levels in the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
