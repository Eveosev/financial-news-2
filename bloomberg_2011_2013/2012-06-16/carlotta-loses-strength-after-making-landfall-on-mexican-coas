Carlotta, the second hurricane of
the Eastern Pacific season, weakened to a tropical depression
over the mountains of southern  Mexico  after producing mudslides
that killed two girls.  Carlotta, with winds of 35 miles (55 kilometers) per hour,
was about 50 miles north-northeast of Acapulco, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said in an  advisory  at 11 a.m.  New
York  time, the most recent posting. The system was moving west-
northwest at 12 mph.  The storm, which has dropped below the hurricane threshold
of 74 mph winds, lost strength as its center moved across the
coast, disrupted by the mountainous landscape. Carlotta made
landfall last night near Puerto Escondido.  Mudslides set off by Carlotta killed two girls, aged 7 and
13, as it passed through the southern state of Oaxaca, state
civil protection spokesman Miguel Manzano said in a telephone
interview from Oaxaca City.  The heavy rains collapsed roofs on some homes and the state
opened shelters for families who had to evacuate, Manzano said.  While the storm will further weaken in the next 48 hours,
it was still capable of producing wind gusts and  storm surge ,
which should gradually diminish today, according to the NHC.  Mexicoâ€™s government withdrew its tropical storm warning
west of Punta Maldonado to Acapulco.  To contact the reporters on this story:
