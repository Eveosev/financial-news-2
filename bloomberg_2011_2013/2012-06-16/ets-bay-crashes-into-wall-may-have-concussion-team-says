New York  Mets outfielder  Jason Bay 
was sent home with a “possible concussion” after he crashed
into the left-field wall during the team’s 7-3 loss to the
Cincinnati Reds at Citi Field, the team said.  Bay, 33, dove into the warning track last night as he tried
to catch Jay Bruce’s inside-the-park home run in the second
inning. His head hit the lower part of the wall.  The outfielder had difficulty getting up and finding the
ball. His throw failed to reach home plate before Bruce crossed
for the score. Trainer Ray Ramirez escorted him off the field.  Bay missed the last two months of the 2010 season with a
severe concussion received when he struck the left-field wall at
Dodgers Stadium.  This season, Bay was on the disabled list from April 24 to
June 6 with a fractured left rib.  To contact the reporter on this story:
