Spain’s 100 billion-euro ($126
billion) bailout appears to be “more than sufficient” to
recapitalize and restructure its financial system, European
Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso  said in an interview
with  Veja magazine .  The euro zone as a whole is better off than the U.S. or
 Japan  in terms of the ratio of debt to gross domestic product,
Barroso said, according to the Sao Paulo-based publication.
Greece should honor its commitments and remain in the currency
union, he said.  Barroso also said Brazil should avoid engaging in
protectionist measures, the magazine reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
