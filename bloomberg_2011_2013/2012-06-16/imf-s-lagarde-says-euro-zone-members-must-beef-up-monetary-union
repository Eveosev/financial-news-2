International Monetary Fund chief
 Christine Lagarde  said euro-zone members must give clear
indications in the weeks ahead that they will reinforce their
monetary union,  Liberation newspaper  quoted her as saying in an
interview.  Euro-zone members should consider the creation of a
European Treasury to issue common debt and be prepared to have
their budgets decided at a European level, Lagarde said.
Monitoring of the financial industry should be at European Union
level rather than at the  European Central Bank , the daily
reported, citing Lagarde. The IMF chief also said she favors the
creation of a European finance minister position.  Lagarde said the IMF will return to  Greece  after the June
17 election to assess what the country has accomplished in the
past eight weeks. She declined to say if Greek debt may have to
be restructured again, the daily reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
