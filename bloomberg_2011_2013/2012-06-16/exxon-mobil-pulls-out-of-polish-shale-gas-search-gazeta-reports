Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  has ended its
search for shale gas in Poland after two wells failed to yield
flows big enough to make development profitable,  Gazeta Wyborcza 
reported today, citing Adam Kopysc, public and government
affairs adviser for the company’s Warsaw-based exploration unit.  “Ending shale gas exploration in Poland means pulling out
of further operations,” the newspaper quoted Kopysc as saying.
In addition to the two failed wells at Krasnystaw and Siennica,
Exxon Mobil has four other licenses among the 109 issued in the
country, Gazeta reported.  Kopysc didn’t answer a call to his mobile phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
