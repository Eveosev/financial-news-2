A takeover of  Etablissements Maurel
& Prom SA (MAU)  by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  would make sense, Investir
newspaper reported, citing an interview with Maurel’s chief
executive.  “In theory, a Shell offer would make sense,” Jean-
Francois Henin told the weekly newspaper after saying last week
he wasn’t approached by Shell. A rumored offer price of 19 euros
($24) a share would be a “high” level, according to the CEO.
“We’ve always said we would be ready to sell Maurel & Prom
under two conditions: The price of course and an assurance to
keep all current staff,” he told Investir.  To contact the reporter on this story:
