The purchase of the  National
Basketball Association ’s New Orleans Hornets by Tom Benson was
completed following approval by the league’s Board of Governors.  Terms of the transaction weren’t released by the league
yesterday. The deal is worth $338 million, according to a person
with direct knowledge of the transaction, who was granted
anonymity because the NBA didn’t make the sale terms public.  Benson, owner of the National Football League Saints,
bought the Hornets from the league’s 30 owners, who purchased
the team from  George Shinn  in December 2010.  “There is a lot of excitement in the region about the
franchise, especially after winning the No. 1 pick in the
upcoming NBA draft,” Benson said in a statement. “We have been
successful with the Saints and I know we can translate that
success to our NBA team as well.”  The Hornets’ lease extension with the state, which provides
funding for upgrades to the  New Orleans  Arena and eliminates all
exit options, attendance benchmarks and financial inducements,
was approved by Governor  Bobby Jindal  and the Louisiana
legislature.  “Championship performance is tied to fan support and the
passion of the New Orleans sports fan is second to none,”
Benson said. “We look forward to joining up with all of our
valued current fans and also introducing this great team game to
many more residents of our city and region.”  In addition to the first selection in the NBA draft June 28,
the Hornets also have the 10th pick. New Orleans will host the
2014 NBA All-Star Game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
