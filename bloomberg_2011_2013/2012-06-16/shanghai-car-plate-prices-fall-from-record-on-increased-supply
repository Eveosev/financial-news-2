Shanghai ’s car-license plate prices
fell in June from a record last month, after the city offered
more permits to cater to demand in  China ’s financial center.  The city auctioned off 9,500 license plates this month,
with the average successful bid at 58,227  yuan  ($9,145),
according to  Shanghai International Commodity Auction Co. , which
conducts the sale for the city’s transport department. The local
government made 200 more permits available for sale after
average prices rose to a record 64,367 yuan in May.  Major cities including Beijing and Shanghai are restricting
the growth of vehicle traffic, even as the pace of auto sales
falters nationwide. The state-backed auto dealership association
said this month that average inventory carried at showrooms
bloated to an unsustainable level exceeding two months of sales
by the end of May.  There were a total of 24,774 bidders for license plates
this month, a 2.2 percent increase from last month, according to
the Shanghai auction company. Shanghai began auctioning plates
in 2002. Cars with out-of-town plates are restricted from the
city’s elevated freeways during peak hours.  For the average price of a permit in June, a buyer in
 Detroit ,  Michigan  could purchase a late-model  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) 
Accent hatchback in Detroit, Michigan, according to car-pricing
website Kelley’s Blue Book.  Beijing’s municipal government started holding lotteries
for car license plates in January 2011 to curb traffic and
exhaust pollution. The Chinese capital’s infamous traffic jams
were recognized in a 2010 International Business Machines Corp.
survey, where respondents voted the Chinese capital as the city
with the world’s most onerous commute.  Statistics released this week in Beijing show gridlock
lasted an average of 55 minutes during weekdays in the first
quarter, compared with 2 hours and 25 minutes in 2010.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
