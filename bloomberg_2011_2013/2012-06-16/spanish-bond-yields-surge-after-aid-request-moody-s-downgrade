Spain ’s bond yields surged the most
since the euro was created in 1999 this week after the nation
requested aid for its banks and asked the  European Central Bank 
for more financial support.  Bunds slumped amid concern Germany will need to increase
borrowing to support its struggling neighbors as Moody’s
Investors Service cut Spain’s credit rating to one step above
junk.  Spanish 10-year yields  approached 7 percent after Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  published a letter to European Union
leaders on June 13 saying the ECB should help countries trying
to shore up their finances. Greek bonds rose before tomorrow’s
election that may determine its future in the euro region.  “The market is saying that the problems in Spain extend
beyond the banks,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist
at WestLB AG in London. “The Moody’s downgrade put the icing on
the cake for Spanish bonds. There’s a growing sense that if
policy makers want to save the single currency then  Germany  may
have to open up to the idea of euro bonds and if that’s the case
then bund yields will need to rise.”  Spain’s 10-year yield rose 67 basis points, or 0.67
percentage point, this week to 6.89 percent at 4:45 p.m. London
time. The 5.85 percent bond due January 2022 changed hands at
92.855 percent of face value.  Spanish Rates  German 10-year bunds fell for a second week with the rate
climbing 11 basis points to 1.44 percent.  The rate on Spanish 10-year bonds jumped to 6.998 percent
on June 14, a euro-era record. Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria yesterday said  Europe ’s fourth-largest
economy has to cut its  budget deficit  because it can’t afford to
pay the  interest rates  the market is demanding. It plans to sell
debt due in 2014, 2015 and 2017 on June 21.  Bunds slid amid speculation global policy makers will take
coordinated action to combat the risks from Europe’s debt
crisis. Leaders from the Group of 20 nations meet June 18-19.  The Greek ballot will turn on whether voters accept
austerity to stay in the euro or reject the conditions of a
bailout and risk exiting the 17-member currency. Greece’s 2
percent bond maturing in February 2023 rose for a second week,
with the yield sliding 1788 basis points to 27.15 percent.  Voting ends at 7 p.m. tomorrow Athens time with a first
official result estimate due around 9:30 p.m.  Spanish debt has handed investors a loss of 1.1 percent
through the month to June 14, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German securities have lost 2 percent and Italian
bonds declined 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
