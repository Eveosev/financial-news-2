Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said Canadian policy makers would have to work quickly
to respond to any “disorderly markets” that may result from a
spreading of the crisis in Europe.  “It’s a very serious matter once these dominoes start to
fall, that’s why we have to act early on as we did in 2008 to
make sure that things don’t accelerate,” Flaherty said today in
an  interview  with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.  Flaherty said policy makers, including the Bank of  Canada ,
could take measures similar to steps implemented in 2008 to
maintain liquidity in Canada’s banking system.  Canada faces a “major shock” and global financial
conditions could deteriorate significantly if Europe’s crisis
worsens, the  Bank of Canada  said June 14.  “If we had disorderly markets in banking that extended
from Europe into the United Kingdom,  United States  and the
entire banking system, and credit started to contract because of
a loss of confidence between banks, then you start to have a
liquidity problem in the banks,” Flaherty said today. “That’s
when governments need to act.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
