New Swansea manager Michael Laudrup
has made Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner one of his top targets
this summer, the  Daily Mirror  said.  Bendtner spent last season on loan at Sunderland. He’s
fallen down the pecking order at Arsenal with the Gunners having
signed  Lukas Podolski  from Cologne and closing on Montpellier
striker Olivier Giroud.  Laudrup, who was hired on a two-year contract yesterday, is
keen to lure his fellow Dane to Wales, the Mirror said.
Bendtener scored two goals in Denmark’s 3-2 loss to Portugal at
Euro 2012 three days ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
