Toyota driver Anthony Davidson will
remain in the hospital until tomorrow for a precautionary check
after his car running in third place at the 24 Hours of  Le Mans 
flipped over and smashed into a tire barrier.  Davidson, 33, was suffering from shock and back pain,
although appeared not to have any serious injury, Toyota said in
a statement at the racetrack 130 miles southwest of Paris.  Amateur driver Piergiuseppe Perazzini, in a Ferrari 458
sports-car, clipped the Britonâ€™s Toyota TS030 Hybrid and it flew
into the air. Perazzini, 56, was able to get out of the car and
sit on a grass verge. Amateur and professionals race side-by-
side in different classes at Le Mans.  Overtaking was suspended for about one and a half hours to
clear up the mess. With cars bunched together at the restart,
the Toyota of Kazuki Nakajima made contact with the Nissan
DeltaWing, which went into a wall and had to quit the race
because of damage to its front end.  The experimental car had taken much of the pre-race
attention because of its design: It has four-inch front wheels
and weighs about half the amount of other entrants. It was
backed by U.S. entrepreneur Don Panoz and the 1967 Le Mans
winner Dan Gurney, and had been running near the back of the
field following early gearbox problems.  To contact the reporters on this story:
