The University of  Arkansas  defeated
Kent State University 8-1 and the University of South Carolina
beat the University of Florida 7-3 in the men’s College World
Series.  The University of  California , Los Angeles and  Arizona , both
winners of their first games, will play each other today in the
double-elimination contest in Omaha, Nebraska. Stony Brook and
Florida State, losers in their first games, will be trying to
avoid elimination.  Arkansas’ Jake Wise hit the go-ahead home run in the second
inning and then drove in two more runs in the eighth. The
Razorbacks meet South Carolina tomorrow.  Jimmy Rider hit a solo home run in the sixth inning for
Kent State. The Golden Flashes play against Florida tomorrow.  South Carolina ’s Erik Payne hit a three-run triple in the
five-run fifth inning then scored the deciding run on a double
by L.B. Dantzler in the Gamecocks’ victory over the Gators.  The Gators had taken a 2-0 lead on Preston Tucker’s two-
run double in the third inning, and Josh Tobias added a third
run for Florida on Mike Zunino’s sacrifice fly in the fifth.  The best-of-three National Collegiate Athletic Association
baseball championship games begin June 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
