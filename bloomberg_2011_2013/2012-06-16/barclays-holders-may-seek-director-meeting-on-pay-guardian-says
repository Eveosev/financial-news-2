Shareholders of  Barclays Plc (BARC)  may
seek a meeting with senior independent director Michael Rake to
discuss pay concerns, the  Guardian  reported.  Investors would prefer to speak with an independent
director rather than Chairman Marcus Agius, the newspaper said,
without identifying the shareholders. They’re seeking a meeting
following reports Alison Carnwath, head of the remuneration
committee, didn’t initially support a 2.7 million-pound ($4.2
million) bonus for Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond.  To contact the reporter on this story:
