The head of  Egypt ’s ruling military
council, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, formally
dissolved parliament and lawmakers have been barred from
entering the legislature, the state-run Ahram Gate website
reported today, citing a decree by the military council.  The ruling, which was issued after the country’s highest
court ordered parliament dissolved, is effective from June 15,
the website said. The constitutional court’s ruling only
affected the parliament’s lower house.  In compliance with “the verdict of the Supreme
Constitutional Court, issued on June 14, the People’s Assembly
is considered dissolved effective June 15,” the decree said,
according to Ahram Gate.  Security officials at the parliament received orders today
to not allow lawmakers into the premises, the website reported.
It said the only exception was for parliament speaker Saad el-
Katatni, who must first file notice before going to the
legislature’s building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
