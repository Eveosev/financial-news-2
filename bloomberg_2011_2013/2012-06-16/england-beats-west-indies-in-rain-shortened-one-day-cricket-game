  England  beat the West Indies by 114
runs in a rain-shortened one-day international cricket match at
the Rose Bowl in Southampton.  Ian Bell scored 126, his second one-day century, as England
reached 288-6 in its 50 overs. The opener passed a fitness test
this morning after being hit in the face with the ball during
practice yesterday.  An hour-long rain delay in the afternoon cut the West
Indiesâ€™ innings to 48 overs and reduced the target to 287 under
the Duckworth-Lewis rules used for weather-shortened matches.  Tim Bresnan then took 4-34 as the visitors were bowled out
for 172 with 14.2 overs remaining. Dwayne Smith, opening in
place of injured Chris Gayle, top-scored for West Indies with
56.  The three-game series continues June 19 at the Oval in
 London  before concluding three days later in Leeds. England has
already won the three-Test series 2-0 and the teams will also
play a Twenty20 match on June 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
