European soccer’s governing body
opened disciplinary proceedings against  Croatia  over alleged
abuses of Italy’s  Mario Balotelli  at the Euro 2012.  UEFA said in a  statement  on its website it was taking
action against the Croatian Football Federation for fans’ racist
chants and symbols during a 1-1 tie against Italy in Poznan,
 Poland . Supporters were also cited for setting off and throwing
fireworks during the Group C match.  UEFA’s control and disciplinary body will hear the case on
June 19, the ruling body said.  The step comes after two monitors from UEFA-appointed
Football Against Racism Europe filed a report stating as many as
500 supporters in the Croatian section subjected Balotelli, who
is of Ghanian descent, to monkey chants throughout the game. A
banana was also thrown onto the field.  The investigation is the latest into supporters during the
16-team tournament being co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland.  UEFA  earlier fined the Russian and German federations for
misbehavior by supporters. Yesterday it also fined the Croatian
federation 25,000 euros ($32,000) for fans throwing fireworks
and other objects, as well as a supporter running onto the field
during a match against Ireland on June 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
