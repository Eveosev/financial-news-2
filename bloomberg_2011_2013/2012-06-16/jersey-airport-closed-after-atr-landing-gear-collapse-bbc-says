Landing gear on a Blue Islands ATR
42 flight carrying 43 passengers collapsed after it touched down
at Jersey Airport in the  Channel Islands , the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported on its website.  No one was injured in the incident, which happened at about
8:30 a.m. local time. The flight originated in Guernsey and the
accident happened while the Blue Islands plane was taxiing to
its stand, the  BBC  said, citing airport spokesman Alan Donald.
ATR is joint-owned by European Aeronautic, Defence and Space Co.
of France and  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  of Italy.  All flights at the airport have been suspended and the
runway is closed, Donald told the BBC. The runway was due to
reopen at 12:30 a.m. local time, BBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
