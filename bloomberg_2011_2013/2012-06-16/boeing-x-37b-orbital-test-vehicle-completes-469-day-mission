Boeing Co. (BA)  said its second X-37B
Orbital Test Vehicle landed in  California  today after a 469-day
mission by the U.S.  Air Force  to test the capabilities of
reusable unmanned vehicles for future space missions.  The pilotless spacecraft, which was launched from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station,  Florida , on March 5, 2011, landed
on a runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base at 5:48 a.m. local
time, Boeing said in a statement.  “With OTV-1, we proved that unmanned space vehicles can be
sent into orbit and safely recovered,” Paul Rusnock, Boeing
vice president of Government Space Systems, said in the
statement. “With OTV-2, we tested the vehicle design even
further by extending the 220-day mission duration of the first
vehicle, and testing additional capabilities.”  Originally a joint research effort beginning in 1999 by
 NASA , Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Boeing, the
program was transferred to the Air Force in 2004. With a length
of 29 feet, 3 inches (about 8.9 meters), height of 9 feet, 6
inches and a wingspan of 14 feet, 11 inches, the X-37B is about
one-fourth the size of the recently retired space shuttles,
Boeing said in a previous release. The vehicles were designed to
stay in orbit for 270 days, Boeing said.  OTV-1 was the U.S.’s first unmanned vehicle to return from
space and land on its own, Boeing said. Previously, the space
shuttle was the only spacecraft capable of returning to Earth
and being reused, the company said in the statement.  The Soviet Union’s Buran shuttle completed one unmanned
flight in 1988.  The Air Force plans another X-37B launch from  Cape
Canaveral  later this year aboard an Atlas V booster; no date has
been set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
