Welsh rally co-driver Gareth Roberts
was killed in a crash during today’s Targo Florio Rally in
Sicily, race organizers said.  Roberts, 24, was the navigator in a car being driven by
Craig Breen which crashed during the eighth stage of the race.
Medical crews attended to Roberts at the scene.  “Despite their best efforts, Gareth Roberts succumbed to
his injuries and the remainder of the event has been canceled as
a mark of respect,” a statement on the Intercontinental Rally
Challenge website said. “Craig Breen was unhurt in the
accident. No spectators were involved.”  Roberts and Breen were in sixth place when the accident
took place. They were competing in the event for the first time,
organizers said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
