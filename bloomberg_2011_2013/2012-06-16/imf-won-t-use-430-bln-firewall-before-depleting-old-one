The  International Monetary Fund  said
it will only tap a $430 billion financial firewall agreed to in
April to shield the world from the European debt crisis after
using up its existing lending power.  The decision is part of rules agreed to by the Washington-
based lender’s board today on how to use the money, which is
expected to be formalized by Group of 20 leaders meeting in Los
Cabos,  Mexico  next week.  “The IMF would only draw on the new agreements after it
has committed most of its existing” permanent resources as well
as a crisis pool of money obtained in 2009, the IMF said in an
e-mailed statement. “Members’ claims on the IMF under the
agreements can be counted as part of their international
reserves, and the IMF will repay any amounts drawn with
interest.”  The U.S., which along with nations from  China  to Germany
had contributed $100 billion to the IMF crisis pool of 2009,
 declined  to take part in the most recent fund-raising effort.
Today’s decision means its past contribution will be used before
the lender taps more recent pledges, including ones from
European countries.  With the new agreements not yet in place, the IMF, which
has co-financed bailouts in  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal , has
about $380 billion  available  to lend. While it is not taking
part in the 100 billion euros rescue for Spain announced last
week by the nations sharing the single currency, it has been
asked to monitor it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
