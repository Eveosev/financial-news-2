The U.S. praised the Yemeni
government for military victories against al-Qaeda fighters in
southern Yemen, a State Department spokeswoman said.  The operations allowed the government to retake control of
“important areas,” including the cities Ja’ar and Zinjibar,
 Victoria Nuland  said today in a statement. The success came
weeks after pushing extremists out of Lawdar, she said.  Al-Qaeda’s presence in the region “has had a devastating
impact on the citizens there and prevented the delivery of
critical humanitarian assistance,” Nuland said. The U.S.
remains committed to working with President Abdu Rabbu Mansour
Hadi, she said.  President  Barack Obama  sent a report yesterday to Congress
confirming that the U.S. is conducting military operations
against al-Qaeda in Yemen in conjunction with the Yemeni
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
