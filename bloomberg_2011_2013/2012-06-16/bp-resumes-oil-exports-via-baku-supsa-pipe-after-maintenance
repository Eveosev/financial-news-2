BP Plc (BP/)  yesterday resumed oil exports
via the Baku-Supsa pipeline after a month of maintenance,
according to Tamam Bayatli, a spokeswoman for the company in the
Azeri capital of Baku.  The pipeline connecting BP’s Sangachal terminal south of
Baku with  Georgia ’s Black Sea port of Supsa was closed for
planned maintenance on May 15.  Production from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oilfield, known
as ACG, or the Shah Deniz fields, was not affected by the
shutdown as crude exports continued through the main Baku-
Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, or BTC, BP said at the time. Both the
ACG and Shah Deniz developments, as well as the BTC pipeline,
are led by BP.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and  Kazakhstan , exported 6.4 million
metric tons of crude in the first quarter. That’s down 7.3
percent from a year earlier, the State Statistics Committee said
in April.  The Caspian Sea nation pumped 18.5 million tons of oil in
the first five months of 2012, down 7.5 percent from a year
earlier, the Statistics Committee said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
