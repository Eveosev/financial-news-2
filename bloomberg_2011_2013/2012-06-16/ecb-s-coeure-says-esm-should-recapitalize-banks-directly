European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said Europe’s permanent bailout fund
should be allowed to offer capital directly to banks.  “If the European Stability Mechanism could inject capital
directly into banks, with strong conditionality and control,
this would also help to break the bank-sovereign loop,” Coeure
said during a speech in Tourrettes,  France , today. Coeure also
backed the “creation of a pan euro-area deposit insurance fund
and a pan euro-area bank resolution framework, supported by a
single supervisory system with centralized decision-making.”  European policy makers are debating the future design of a
more integrated single currency as a debt crisis that has seen
four countries appeal for bailouts highlights its shortcomings.
While the ESM, the euro-area’s 500 billion euro ($632 billion)
permanent rescue fund, is due to start operating next month,
some countries have still not ratified the mechanism and a
debate over whether bank recapitalization funds can flow
directly or only via governments is yet to be resolved.  Coeure said the fundamental causes of a lack of trust in
 Europe ’s banking sector need to be addressed if the functioning
of money markets is to return to normal.  “It may take a long time before secured, and particularly
unsecured, money-market segments begin to function normally
again,” he said.  The Frankfurt-based ECB has granted more than 1 trillion
euros in 3-year loans to the financial sector since December, in
a bid to ward off a looming credit crunch.  “Restoring proper market functioning requires a series of
actions to rebuild confidence in the creditworthiness of banks
and governments, as well as the taking of decisive steps towards
a banking union,” Coeure said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
