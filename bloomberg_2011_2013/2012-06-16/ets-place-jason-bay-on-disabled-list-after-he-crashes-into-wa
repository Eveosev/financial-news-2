The New York Mets placed outfielder
 Jason Bay  on the seven-day disabled list today after he crashed
into the left-field wall at Citi Field during last night’s 7-3
loss to the  Cincinnati Reds .  The Mets also said on Twitter that they had reinstated
infielder  Justin Turner  from the 15-day disabled list to take
Bay’s place on the roster.  Bay, 33, was sent home last night with a possible
concussion after his head hit the wall as he dove to try to
catch a fly ball by Jay Bruce that went for an inside-the-park
home run.  Bay missed the last two months of the 2010 season with a
severe concussion after he crashed into the wall at Dodger
Stadium. Bay, who’s hitting .187 with four home runs and six
runs batted in this season in 22 games, was also on the disabled
list from April 24 to June 6 with a fractured left rib.  Turner, 27, who’s hitting .269 in 33 games for  New York 
this season, had been sidelined with a right ankle injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
