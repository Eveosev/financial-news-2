CVC Capital Partners Inc., a part-
owner of Formula One, sold $500 million of shares in the auto-
racing series to  Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. (WDR)   The sale values Formula One at $9.1 billion and boosts
Waddell & Reed’s holding to 20.9 percent, CVC said in a
 statement . Waddell & Reed,  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and Norges Bank
Investment Management paid CVC $1.6 billion for 21 percent of
the company in an earlier deal  announced  May 22.  Formula One canceled $1.8 billion of loans sold last month
after postponing an initial public offering, two people with
knowledge of the matter said yesterday. Investors including CVC,
which has been a controlling shareholder since 2006, had planned
to raise as much as $3 billion by selling stock in  Singapore .  Formula One is notifying lenders that the debt transaction
won’t be completed as it was conditional upon the company
pricing the IPO by June 30, said the people, who asked not be
named because the deal is confidential. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc arranged the loans,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The auto-racing group’s Chief Executive Officer  Bernie Ecclestone  said last month that the planned stock sale may not
take place until later this year because of time pressures and a
volatile equity market.  CVC bought about 63 percent of Formula One in 2005 and 2006
using $2.5 billion of loans. The buyout firm is seeking to take
Formula One public after leading racing teams Ferrari,  Red Bull 
and McLaren agreed to new terms through 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
