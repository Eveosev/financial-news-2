Nigerian security forces yesterday
killed four suspected members of a militant Islamist group in a
raid in the northern city of Kano, according to a statement.  A team of military and security-service officials raided a
suspected hideout of the Boko Haram sect following a tipoff, the
Joint Security Task Force in Kano said in the statement. The
refuge was thought to be the media center of the “terrorist
elements” operating in the city, it said.  Authorities in  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s biggest oil producer,
blame Boko Haram, which seeks to impose strict Islamic law in
the country, for attacks in the mainly Muslim north and Abuja
that have killed hundreds of people this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
