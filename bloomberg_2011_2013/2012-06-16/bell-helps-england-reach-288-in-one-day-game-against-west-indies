Ian Bellâ€™s century helped  England 
reach 288-6 in its 50 overs in the opening one-day cricket match
against West Indies.  Bell finished with 126 at the  Rose Bowl  in Southampton for
his second one-day century. The opener passed a fitness test
this morning after being hit in the chin during practice
yesterday.  Jonathan Trott added 42 for England and Craig Keiswetter
was 38 not out.  Marlon Samuels took two wickets for West Indies. The
visitor is without opening batsman Chris Gayle, who was ruled
out with a left shin injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
