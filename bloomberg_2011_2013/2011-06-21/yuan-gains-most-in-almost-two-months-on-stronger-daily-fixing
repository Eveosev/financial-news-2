China ’s yuan strengthened the most
in almost two months on speculation policy makers will tolerate
appreciation to tame inflation.  The People’s Bank of China set the currency’s reference
rate at a stronger level for a third day, fixing it 6.4690 per
dollar. China should continue to raise banks’ reserve-
requirement ratios to curb inflation, Market News International
reported yesterday, citing an unidentified person close to the
National Development and Reform Commission.  “The yuan is moving higher today probably in a trend that
will extend into next year,” said Tommy Ong, Hong Kong-based
head of advisory sales with DBS Bank Ltd. “China is inclined to
let the currency strengthen to combat inflation pressure,”
after a number of increases in  interest rates  and banks’ reserve
requirements, Ong said.  The yuan advanced 0.19 percent, the most since April 27, to
6.4655 per dollar as of the close at 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The
currency touched 6.4634 on June 17, the strongest level since
1993.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.07
percent to 6.4683 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards rose 0.11 percent to 6.3875, a 1.2 percent premium to
the spot rate in Shanghai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank has raised benchmark interest rates four
times since September, boosted lenders’ reserve-requirement
ratios nine times to a record and allowed the yuan to gain 1.8
percent in 2011. A stronger currency helps curb inflation by
reducing the cost of imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
