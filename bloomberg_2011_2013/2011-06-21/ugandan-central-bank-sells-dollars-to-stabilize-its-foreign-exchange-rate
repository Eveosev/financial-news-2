Uganda ’s central bank sold dollars
in the domestic foreign-exchange market today to stabilize the
East African nation’s currency, which fell to an 18-year low
against the  U.S. dollar .  “We intervened” to bring stability to the market, Paddy
Turyamwijuka, deputy director of financial markets at the Bank
of Uganda, said in a phone interview today from Kampala, the
capital. He declined to provide further details.  On June 15, the central bank sold $20 million to stabilize
the market following an outflow of $30 million caused by
currency speculators, Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile said
on June 16.  Uganda’s shilling has depreciated 7 percent against the
dollar since Jan. 1 and is Africa’s second-worst performing
currency this year, after the Kenyan shilling, according to
Bloomberg data. The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.7 percent to
2,482 today, the lowest since June 22, 1993.  Inflation in the East African country surged to a
17-year high of 16 percent in May as food and fuel prices
increased.  Uganda is scheduled to become an oil producer next year
when  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  is expected to start pumping crude and gas
from the Lake Albert Basin. The country has an estimated 2.5
billion barrels of oil, with about 1 billion barrels in proven
reserves, according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
