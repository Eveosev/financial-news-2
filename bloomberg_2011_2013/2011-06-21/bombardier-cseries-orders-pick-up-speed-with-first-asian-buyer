Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  gained traction with
its CSeries single-aisle jet at the  Paris Air Show  after Korean
Air Lines agreed to buy as many as 30 of the aircraft, becoming
the first customer from  Asia  to select the mid-range airliner.  South Korea’s flagship airline signed an agreement to buy
10 CS300 aircraft, with an additional 10 options, and 10
purchase rights on CS300 airliners following “several months of
detailed negotiations,” Bombardier said at the air show today.  “This is our first CSeries aircraft customer in Asia and
signals the aircraft program’s entry into the fast growing Asia-
Pacific market,” Gary R. Scott, the president of Bombardier
Commercial Aircraft, said at the show. “Our list of customers
continues to grow and now covers the Asian, European and North
American markets.”  Bombardier has managed to reverse its fortunes on the
CSeries after failing to sign a single order at last year’s
Farnborough show, which alternates with Paris. Bombardier is
targeting the single-aisle market for jets with 100 to 149
seats, an area now controlled by  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
