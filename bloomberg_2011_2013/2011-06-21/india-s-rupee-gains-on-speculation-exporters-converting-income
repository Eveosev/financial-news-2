India ’s rupee rose on speculation
exporters are repatriating income to take advantage of a
favorable exchange rate, and as concern Greece will default on
its debt eased.  The currency touched 45.06 per dollar yesterday, the
weakest level since May 31. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
regional shares climbed for the first time in a week after
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  had assured him that his government
would take the steps needed to obtain financial aid from the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund.  “Whenever the rupee touches the 45 level, exporters jump
in,” said Vikas Babu, a Mumbai-based currency trader at state-
owned  Andhra Bank . “There is some relief from Greece as reports
suggest they want a resolution of the issue.”  The rupee strengthened 0.4 percent to 44.84 per dollar as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The currency also strengthened after the benchmark  stock
index  rebounded from the lowest close in four months. The Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 0.3 percent to
17,560.30.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.44
to the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of
45.60 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets
at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled
in dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
