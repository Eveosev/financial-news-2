Northern Ireland  police  said shots
were fired and two men were taken to hospital with gunshot
injuries during “major” rioting in east Belfast between
Catholics and Protestants which began late yesterday.  “Petrol bombs, fireworks, bricks, stones and smoke bombs
were fired during major disorder last night,” a police
spokeswoman said in a recorded message today. “It is understood
a number of shots were fired from both sides.”  “It was exceptionally serious and I undoubtedly witnessed
orchestrated violence,” Conall McDevitt, a lawmaker with the
 Social Democratic & Labour Party , said in an e-mailed statement.
Everybody in the community with “political and faith leadership
roles” should work together “to assure that this situation is
defused,” he said.  Tension between Catholic and Protestant communities in
 Belfast  rises at this time of year as parades celebrating a 17th
century victory over Catholics increase, culminating in hundreds
of marches on July 12. East Belfast is predominantly Protestant
while the Short Strand area is a Catholic enclave within the
district.  In a separate incident, a bomb was thrown at a police
patrol in west Belfast in the early hours of today, police said.
No-one was injured in the attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
