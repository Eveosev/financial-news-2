Cameroonâ€™s  Cotton Development Corp.
lost 14 billion  CFA francs  ($31 million) during the 2010-11
harvest season because of smuggling of the fiber, le Jour
reported, citing Ibrahim Ngamie, director of agricultural
production.  Farmers prefer to sell their cotton to neighboring  Nigeria 
where prices are higher than the 200 CFA francs per kilogram
(2.2 pounds) offered by the Cameroonian company known as
Sodecoton, the Yaounde-based newspaper cited Ngamie as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
