Taiwan ’s dollar rebounded from the
lowest level in three weeks after the government reported export
orders that beat analysts’ estimates, boosting optimism the
island’s economic recovery remains intact.  Orders for goods climbed 11.5 percent in May from a year
earlier, compared with a 10.1 percent gain the previous month,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs said yesterday. The median of
14 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 9.45 percent
increase. Asian currencies recovered from yesterday’s losses
after Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of
euro-area finance ministers, said a solution to Greece’s debt
crisis will be found.  “Looks like the problem in  Europe  has mitigated
temporarily,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency
trader at Union Bank of Taiwan. “Exporters continue to sell the
 U.S. dollar , which is supporting the local currency.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$28.949
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close in Taipei,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.005 on June 17,
the weakest level in three weeks.  Government bonds  declined. The yield on the 1.375 percent
notes due March 2021, the most-traded securities, rose two basis
points to 1.49 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The overnight money-market rate dropped for a second day.
The rate, which measures interbank funding availability,
declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.33
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
