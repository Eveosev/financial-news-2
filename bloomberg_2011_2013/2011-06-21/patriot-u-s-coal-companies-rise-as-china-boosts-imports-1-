Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX) , a producer with
mines in Appalachia and the Illinois Basin, led other companies
higher after a report that China’s coal imports hit a four-month
high and on speculation the equities are underpriced.  Patriot rose 93 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $20.25 at 10:32
a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.  Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR) , the world’s third-largest producer of
steelmaking coal, increased $1.82, or 4.4 percent, to $42.80.
 Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) , the second-biggest U.S. coal company, added 78
cents, or 3.1 percent, to $25.59.  China’s coal imports gained 22 percent in May from April to
13.6 million metric tons, a four-month high, according to data
from the Beijing-based General Administration of Customs today.
Separately, today’s gain halted a 9.8 percent drop this month
through yesterday in the Stowe Global Coal Index.  “Coal stocks are very cheap,” said  Jeremy Sussman , an
analyst at Brean Murray Carret & Co. in New York. “Fundamentals
and valuation are just taking over at this point. We’ve also
seen China bolster its imports for the third month in a row.”  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest U.S. coal producer,
jumped $1.80, or 3.3 percent, to $56.01.  Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , a
coal and natural-gas company, increased $1.37, or 3 percent, to
$47.48.  Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) , a Southern Appalachia producer of
steelmaking coal, added $2.76, or 2.6 percent, to $108.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
