Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose as Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a
parliamentary confidence vote, moving the country a step closer
to avoiding a default on its debt.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s largest
exporter of consumer electronics that gets more than 20 percent
of its sales in Europe, climbed 1.2 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of Toyota Motor Corp. advanced 1.1
percent after Deutsche Bank AG. raised its profit estimate for
the world’s biggest carmaker. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s No. 1 mining company, gained 1.7 percent after metal
prices increased.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,525 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,450 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,510
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index advanced 0.8 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
increased 0.4 percent in Wellington.  “Excessive fears for  Europe ’s debt issues will decrease,”
said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. “As Papandreou won a confidence vote, Greece
took a step forward to parliamentary approval and additional
loans.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In  New York , the index rose 1.3 percent to
1,295.52 yesterday as concern about Greece’s debt crisis eased.
Shares advanced even after a report showed sales of existing U.S.
homes fell in May to the lowest level in six months.  Greek Vote  Purchases of existing homes dropped 3.8 percent to a 4.81
million annual pace last month, in line with the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists, data from the National
Association of Realtors showed.  In Athens early today, a total of 155 lawmakers in the 300-
seat parliament supported the confidence motion, with 143 voting
against, Speaker Filippos Petsalnikos said in remarks carried
live state-run Vouli TV.  Attention now turns to whether Papandreou can push through
parliamentary approval next week of a 78 billion-euro ($112
billion) package of budget cuts to stave off the threat of
default.  European finance ministers said this week they would hold
off on approving a 12 billion-euro payment to the country
promised for July until passage of the plans to cut the deficit,
sell state assets and impose a “crisis levy” on wages.  Yen Falls  The yen depreciated to 115.83 against the euro, the lowest
since June 15, compared with 115.04 at the close of  stock
trading  in  Tokyo  yesterday. A weaker yen boosts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 5.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 3 percent by the  S&P
500  and a drop of 2.3 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500
and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum rose 0.9 percent
yesterday.  Deutsche Bank analyst Kurt Sanger increased his estimate of
Toyota’s operating profit for the year ending in March 2012 to
500 billion yen ($6.2 billion) from 461 billion yen. That’s
higher than Toyota’s target of 300 billion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
