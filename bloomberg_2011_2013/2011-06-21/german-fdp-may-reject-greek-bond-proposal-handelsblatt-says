German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
Free Democrat allies may reject any accord in the euro region
that attributes a voluntary investor role in a new bailout for
 Greece , the  Handelsblatt  newspaper reported.  Otto Solms, the FDP’s finance parliamentary spokesman, says
a proposal endorsed by Merkel and  France  last week to integrate
bondholders on a voluntary basis strays too far from German
lawmakers’ envisioned plan, the newspaper reported.  German coalition lawmakers stated in a June 10
parliamentary resolution that bondholder participation must be
“adequate” and “divided fairly” between taxpayers and
creditors, the newspaper cited Solms as saying.  “What we’re seeing in resolutions and declarations doesn’t
correspond with this and is unsatisfactory,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
