Suspected Islamic gunmen killed five
policemen and a civilian during a raid on a police station and a
bank yesterday in  Nigeria ’s northern Katsina state, police said.  The attackers stole weapons from the police armory and
freed suspects detained in the station in the town of Kankara,
Katsina police spokesman Abubakar Mohammed said by phone today
from the state capital.  Authorities in northern Nigeria have blamed a radical
Islamic sect known as Boko Haram for a spate of bomb attacks and
killings targeting government officials and the security forces
since last year.  The group, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s
Taliban movement, claimed responsibility for a blast on June 16
at Nigeria’s police headquarters in the capital, Abuja, which
killed at least five people and injured 11.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous
nation, with more than 140 million people, is roughly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south. More than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious
clashes in the West African nation between 1999 and 2009,
according to the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
