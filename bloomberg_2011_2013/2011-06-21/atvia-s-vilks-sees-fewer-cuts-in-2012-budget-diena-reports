Latvia  will need to find savings of
100 million lati ($202.6 million) to 150 million lati in the
2012 budget, less than previous estimates, Finance Minister
Andris Vilks said, according to the newspaper  Diena .  International lenders had put the figure at 150 million
lati to 180 million lati. The savings will be made mostly
through spending cuts and increased revenue from the grey, or
untaxed, economy, Vilks told the Riga-based newspaper.  The Baltic country will be able to meet all the criteria to
adopt the euro in 2014, Vilks said, according to the newspaper.
If Latvia sees “big problems” in the euro region shortly
before 2014 it may put off adopting the currency, Vilks said.  Vilks said he will run in parliamentary elections later
this year should they take place, the newspaper reported.
President Valdis Zalters last month called a July 23 referendum
in which voters will decide whether to dissolve parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
