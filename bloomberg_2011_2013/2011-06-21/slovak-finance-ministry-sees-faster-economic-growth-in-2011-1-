The Slovak Finance Ministry raised
its forecast for economic growth this year to 3.6 percent from
the 3.4 percent projected in February, citing increasing demand
for the countryâ€™s exports.  Gross domestic product is expected to grow 4.4 percent in
2012 and 4.2 percent in 2013, according to the forecast e-mailed
by the Bratislava, Slovakia-based  ministry . The ministry
previously forecast growth of 4.8 percent in 2012 and 2013.  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, is relying on
increased demand in western  Europe  to drive growth as government
austerity measures depress domestic consumption. Demand from
Slovak consumers will revive gradually as export-oriented
manufacturers add jobs, the ministry forecasts.  The ministry increased its estimate for average inflation
in 2011 to 4.1 percent from 3.5 percent because of a faster-
than-expected increase in commodity prices. The average
inflation rate will then slow to 3.5 percent in 2012 and 2013,
the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
