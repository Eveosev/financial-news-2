Insurance regulators must settle on
global capital and accounting standards to enhance risk
management, said Julie Dickson,  Canada ’s financial services
regulator.  “A key issue for the global  insurance industry  is the lack
of global standards on both supervisory and regulatory fronts,”
Dickson, superintendent of the  Office of the Superintendent of
Financial Institutions , said during a speech today at the
 International Insurance Society  conference in Toronto.  In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors hasn’t made as much
progress as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on
“international harmonization” in the banking industry, said
Dickson, 53.  “Regulators around the world have to decide whether it is
important enough to have a global capital standard and to have
more uniform supervisory approaches,” Dickson told reporters
following her speech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
