Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, will build ethanol mills to boost
production and guarantee stable supplies, Energy Minister Edison Lobao told the  O Globo  newspaper.  Petrobras will more than double its stake in Brazil’s
ethanol market to 12 percent from 5 percent, Lobao told the Rio
de Janeiro-based newspaper. The government decided to have
Petrobras increase investments in ethanol after prices for the
fuel climbed earlier this year, Lobao told O Globo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
