Lebanon asked the  United Nations  to
adopt measures to prevent a conflict with  Israel  over oil and
gas exploration that may fall within Lebanese territorial
waters,  Beirut ’s Daily Star said.  Israel’s agreement with Cyprus to demarcate Israeli
maritime borders last year “is a violation of Lebanon’s
sovereignty and economic rights,” Lebanese Foreign Minister
Adnan Mansour said in a letter sent today to UN Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
