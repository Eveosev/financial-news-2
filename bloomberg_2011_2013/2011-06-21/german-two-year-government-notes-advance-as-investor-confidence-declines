German two-year notes advanced,
reversing an earlier decline, after a report showed investor
confidence in  Europe ’s largest economy dropped to the least in 2
1/2 years as the region’s debt crisis worsened.  The advance pushed the two-year yield down for the first
time in three days. The 10-year bund yield was within five basis
points of a six-month low. The ZEW Center for European Economic
Research in Mannheim said its index of investor and analyst
expectations, which aims to predict developments six months in
advance, fell to minus 9 from plus 3.1 in May. That’s the lowest
since January, 2009. Economists predicted a decline to minus 3,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “The ZEW numbers suggest the German recovery may be losing
some momentum,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “That’s
giving some support to bunds. Direction in the market is
dictated by developments in  Greece .”  The two-year note yield fell one basis point to 1.52
percent as of 12:57 p.m. in London after earlier climbing as
high as 1.53 percent. It dropped to 1.43 percent on June 16, the
least since Feb. 22. The 1.75 percent security due June 2013
rose 0.015, or 15 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,435) face
amount, to 100.45.  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 2.97 percent.
It reached 2.91 percent on June 16, the lowest since Jan. 11.  German Haven  Bunds have gained this year as investors seek a haven amid
mounting concern that policy makers will fail to contain the
euro region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  German  government bonds  have returned 0.3 percent in 2011,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, while Treasuries
gained 3.3 percent. Greek and Portuguese securities have both
lost 19 percent, while Irish debt has dropped 11 percent, the
indexes show.  Greek bonds rose as Prime Minister  George Papandreou  faces
a confidence vote that may determine whether the nation becomes
the first euro-area country to miss a debt payment. European
Union leaders have insisted Papandreou secure multi-party
support for austerity measures that are a condition of the aid
needed to avoid default as soon as next month.  Greece Focus  “The market’s focus is very much on Greece, and the no-
confidence vote is in the spotlight,” said  David Schnautz , a
fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.
“Papandreou needs to get over that hurdle. There may be signs
of more erosion of his support, and that may not go down well
with the market. It’s a must-clear hurdle.”  Greek 10-year bond yields dropped nine basis points to
17.26 percent. They rose to a euro-era record 18.35 percent on
June 17. Two-year yields, which surpassed 30 percent for the
first time last week, fell for a third day, dropping 58 basis
points to 28.03 percent.  Greece sold 1.25 billion euros of 91-day Treasury bills at
an average yield of 4.62 percent. Investors bid for 2.94 times
the amount of debt on offer. That compares with a so-called bid-
to-cover ratio of 3.3 at the previous auction of similar-
maturity securities held on May 17, which were allotted at 4.06
percent.  Portuguese 10-year yields fell four basis points to 11.11
percent. They reached an all-time high 11.19 percent yesterday.
Two-year note yields were little changed at 13.18 percent after
reaching an all-time high 13.26 percent yesterday.  ‘Crisis Levy’  Irish 10-year yields declined eight basis points to 11.38
percent. The yield jumped to a record 11.70 percent on June 17.  Spain  sold 3 billion euros of three- and six-month bills.
The Treasury in  Madrid  said it sold 632 million euros of three-
month bills at an average yield of 1.568 percent, compared with
1.380 percent at the last sale on May 24. Spain also sold 2.36
billion euros of six-month debt at an average yield of 1.776
percent, compared with 1.766 percent on May 24.  Ministers at a euro-crisis meeting in Luxembourg
“forcefully reminded the Greek government” to fulfill its
commitments, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told
reporters yesterday. Decisions on the next payout and a three-
year follow-up package were put off until early July.  The  International Monetary Fund , contributor of a third of
the bailout money for Greece, Ireland and  Portugal , has warned
European leaders that a failure to take decisive action on the
debt crisis risks triggering “large global spillovers.” At the
same time, Papandreou is struggling to convince Greeks to accept
a 78 billion-euro package of state-asset sales and budget cuts,
which include a “crisis levy” on wages.  -- With assistance from Maria Petrakis in  Athens  and Angeline Benoit in Madrid. Editors:  Matthew Brown , Mark McCord  To contact the reporter on this story:
