Bank of Montreal (BMO) , Canada’s fourth-
largest bank, said it received regulatory approvals to complete
its acquisition of  Marshall & Ilsley Corp. (MI)  and that the deal
won’t require an additional stock offering.  Bank of Montreal, which previously said it may have to sell
“less than” C$400 million ($412 million) in stock to buy
Milwaukee-based M&I, has received all “key” bank regulatory
approvals, the Toronto-based company said today in a statement.
The companies expect to complete the transaction on July 5,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
