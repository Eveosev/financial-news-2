The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rebounded after touching its 200-day moving average last week, a
sign that the market’s decline from an April peak may be
limited, analysts who study charts to make predictions said.  The benchmark index for U.S. equities fell to as low as
1,258.07 on June 16, 0.17 point above its average level of
1,257.90 in the previous 200 days, before recouping the loss and
ending the day higher. The S&P 500 has risen 2.3 percent as of
12:57 p.m. New York time from the intraday low to trim its
decline from the 2011 peak on April 29 to 5.1 percent.  The 200-day moving average “is a pretty significant
support level,” as it’s close to the S&P 500’s low for the year
in March and to the closing level at the end of 2010,  Ryan Detrick , senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment
Research in Cincinnati, said in an interview. “There could be
some potential buying here,” he said. “We’re encouraged the
market held pretty well. Longer term, the uptrend is still in
place.”  The S&P 500 finished last year at 1,257.64 after rallying
13 percent. This year, the index is up 2.9 percent as government
stimulus measures and better-than-estimated earnings countered
concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and weaker-than-forecast
economic data.  The benchmark index has stayed above its 200-day moving
average since Sept. 13, Bloomberg data show.  Christopher
Verrone , head of  technical analysis  at New York-based Strategas
Research Partners, said he expects the market to resume its
advance because the S&P 500’s retreat so far has been limited at
that threshold.  “Major market tops typically form below 200-day moving
averages,” he wrote in a note today. “We’ll need to see a more
severe deterioration to trend before our longer-term bias turns
more cautious.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
