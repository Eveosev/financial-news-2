The premium for Heavy Louisiana
Sweet crude in the U.S. Gulf Coast surged to a record margin as
 TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  curtailed Canadian crude shipments to the U.S.
Midwest.  TransCanada Corp. reduced July crude deliveries on its
591,000-barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline by 19 percent, according
to a bulletin sent to shippers yesterday that was obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 75 cents to $21 a
barrel over West Texas Intermediate as of 2:16 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the largest gap
since at least 1991, when Bloomberg began collecting the data.
Light Louisiana Sweet added 75 cents to $20.75 over the
benchmark.  Other U.S. Gulf crude grade premiums weakened as the gap
between Brent and the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
narrowed $1.26 to $16.80 a barrel as of 3:06 p.m. in  New York .  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed 30 cents to $13.40 a barrel, while Poseidon lost
10 cents to $12.10 over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon was unchanged at $12 a barrel above
WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to $1.55.
Thunder Horse’s premium added 30 cents to $19 a barrel.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $9. Syncrude is a
light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in
 Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 50 cents to
$19 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
