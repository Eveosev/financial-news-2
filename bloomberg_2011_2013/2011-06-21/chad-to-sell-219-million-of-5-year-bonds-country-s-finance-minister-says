Chad will offer 100 billion  CFA
francs  ($219 million) of five-year local-currency bonds at an
interest rate of 6 percent to fund investment projects and pay
debts, said Finance Minister Gata Ngoulou.  The bills will be listed on the Libreville, Gabon-based
Central African Stock Exchange, he said in a statement handed to
reporters in Yaounde, the Cameroonian capital, today. The
deadline for the offer is June 23.  “Although not particularly attractive for offshore
accounts, we still suspect the issue will prove appealing to
central African investors given the lack of listed securities in
the Monetary and Economic Community of Central Africa,”  Samir Gadio , a London-based emerging markets strategist with Standard
Bank Group Ltd., said in an e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
