Middle East crude oil for sale to
 Asia  fell for a second day amid a drop in demand as refining
profits slumped and supply increased.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s Murban for August loading
dropped 12 cents to a discount of 25 cents a barrel below its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest gap since Aug. 2. Qatar Land declined 10
cents to 35 cents below its official level, its largest discount
since July 1, Bloomberg data showed.  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest oil exporter, was said to
have sold additional crude cargoes to refiners in Asia,
depressing prices for other Middle East crude at a time when
processing profits are sliding. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude
dropped 34 cents to $19.07 a barrel today, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based brokerage.  Oman crude for immediate loading climbed $1.58, or 1.5
percent, to $107.48 barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai
oil for delivery in August rose 1.4 percent to $106.91. Murban
increased 1.1 percent to $111.63.  Oman futures for August delivery advanced 50 cents to
$106.60 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:58 p.m.
Singapore time, with 650 contracts traded. The settlement price
was at $107.15 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker versus the Persian Gulf grade, narrowed 15
cents to $5.90 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates, a broker. The exchange for swaps for September fell
11 cents to $5.59 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
