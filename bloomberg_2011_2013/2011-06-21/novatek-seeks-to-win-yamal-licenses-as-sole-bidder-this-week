OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-biggest
natural-gas producer, may win four licenses this week on the
Yamal Peninsula as it seeks resources for its liquefied natural
gas project in the country’s Arctic.  Novatek is the sole bidder for the licenses to fields that
hold about 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources, Chief
Financial Officer Mark Gyetvay told reporters in London today.  The Tarko-Sale, Russia-based gas producer plans to produce
LNG, gas cooled to a liquid for transportation by tanker, at the
Yamal LNG project starting in 2016. The company is developing
the South Tambey field to supply the plant.  Novatek needs more resources for the project, Gyetvay said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
