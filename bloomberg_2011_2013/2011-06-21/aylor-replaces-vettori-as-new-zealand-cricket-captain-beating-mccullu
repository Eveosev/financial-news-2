Ross Taylor will replace Daniel Vettori as captain of  New Zealand ’s cricket team after beating
Brendon McCullum to the job.  The appointment of the 27-year-old Taylor, who had been
Vettori’s vice-captain, was “fully endorsed” by the board of
New Zealand Cricket, the governing body said today in a
statement. Vettori stepped down following this year’s  World Cup .  “The process to select the captain has been robust,”
Justin Vaughan, New Zealand Cricket’s chief executive officer,
said in the statement. “We wanted to make sure the right people
were involved and that we appointed the right man for the job.
I’m sure we have done that.  Middle-order batsman Taylor, who averages 41.12 in 30 Tests
and 36.80 in 107 one-day internationals, already led his country
in 11 one-day games and three Twenty20 matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
