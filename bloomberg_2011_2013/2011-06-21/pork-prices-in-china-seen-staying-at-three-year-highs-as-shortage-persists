Pork prices in  China , the biggest
producer and consumer, may stay at their highest level in more
than three years as a shortage persists, said Wang Xiaoyue, an
analyst at Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultant Ltd.  Prices climbed 20 percent this year by June 10 to 22.52
yuan ($3.48) a kilogram, the costliest since April 2008,
according to the Ministry of Commerce. They advanced a further
4.8 percent in the week to June 19, the ministry said today,
without elaborating.  Pork is the country’s most consumed meat and its weighting
in the food component of the  consumer price index  means every 20
percent year-on-year increase leads to a one percentage-point
gain in the final inflation gauge, Beijing Orient’s Wang said.
China has ordered banks to keep more money as reserves six times
this year and raised  interest rates  twice to rein in inflation
that accelerated in May to the fastest in almost three years.  “The shortage looks set to continue in the next year
because the herd size was reduced sharply,” Wang said by phone
from Beijing today.  The tight supplies are the result of farmers reducing herds
after prices declined almost 20 percent in the 15 months through
March 2010, Wang said. It takes 12 months for a piglet to become
mature enough for slaughter, he said.  Higher production costs will limit how much prices may
decline, Wang said. The total cost, including labor and animal
feed, has gone up to 1,700 yuan to 1,800 yuan per hog, so that
the pork must sell for at least 20 yuan a kilogram for farmers
to breakeven, he said.  Record Prices  The price of pork and live hogs surged to a record this
month, the  China Daily  reported today, citing Feng Yonghui,
chief analyst at Soozhu.com, a website that monitors the market.
The price for live pigs rose to 18.57 yuan a kilogram by the end
of the third week of June, exceeding the previous record set in
April 2008, the newspaper reported, citing Feng. The price of
pork rose to 27.67 yuan a kilogram last week, also exceeding a
record set in 2008, according to the report.  China produced a total 50.7 million tons of pork in 2010,
according to Beijing Orient’s data, and represented about 70
percent of total meat output last year. Production may be flat
to lower this year, according to Wang’s estimate.  --Feiwen Rong. Editors:  John Liu , James Poole  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
