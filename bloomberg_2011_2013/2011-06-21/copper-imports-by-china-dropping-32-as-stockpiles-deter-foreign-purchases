China ’s copper imports may plunge 32
percent this year, more than earlier estimated, as stockpiles in
the world’s biggest user stay above average, said state-owned
researcher Beijng Antaike Information Development Co.  “We have cut our forecast from 2.4 million tons made at
the beginning of this year to 2 million tons,” said Antaike
copper analyst Li Yusheng in a phone interview. “We think the
destocking will continue.” Refined shipments fell 8.4 percent
in 2010 to 2.92 million tons, according to the General
Administration of Customs.  A decline in imports may push down prices further from a
record reached in February. Shipments tumbled 47 percent in May
from a year earlier as fabricators continued destocking, keeping
local prices low and making it unprofitable to buy from
overseas, data showed today.  “Imports failed to climb in a pickup of seasonal demand in
April and May, and this isn’t a good sign,” Li said. “We think
inventories at bonded and exchange warehouses can be further
tapped to meet demand in the fall.”  Stockpiles at bonded warehouses in  Shanghai  have fallen to
about 400,000 tons from as much as 600,000 tons two months ago,
while the historical average was around 200,000 tons, according
to Li. Inventories at the Shanghai Futures Exchange-monitored
warehouses have fallen 51 percent from this year’s high in March
to 87,310 tons last week, bourse data showed.  Imports of refined copper were 149,235 tons last month,
compared with 279,690 a year earlier and 160,236 tons in April,
data show. Shipments in the first five months fell 33 percent
from a year ago to 905,434 tons.  Price Drops  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was traded at $9,070 a ton at 4:43 p.m. Shanghai time,
about 11 percent lower than February’s record of $10,190.  Imports have fallen as local output has risen and prices
overseas have been more expensive, making imports unprofitable
for traders who seek to exploit price gaps between markets.
Refined-copper output in China hit a record 470,000 tons in
March and was 439,000 tons in May.  “The London price is still too high for any restocking
plan,” said Zhao Kai, an analyst Jinrui Futures Co., a
subsidiary of China’s largest refined copper producer Jiangxi
Copper Co. “As the June-to-August period is the usual slack
season, we probably won’t see a strong rebound in imports,
despite the significant decline of domestic stocks,” he said.  Rebound  To be sure, the drop in imports so far has prompted
expectations of a rebound later this year among some analysts.
Prices will rise to a record $12,000 a ton by the end of this
year as Chinese imports begin rising from July, said Nicholas
Snowdon, an analyst at  Barclays Capital , on June 8.  Imports in June may jump 25 percent from April as
consumption and investment demand rise, Jesse Jiang, the manager
of copper research at Antaike, said June 7.  Copper may climb to a record $11,000 a ton by the end of
the year, partly because  Japan , the world’s fourth-biggest user,
will need to rebuild following the March 11 earthquake, draining
global inventories as mining output wanes, analysts in a
Bloomberg survey said in April.  Dwindling supplies of copper scrap may also lift imports.
Copper recyclers in southern China have been reducing output of
refined metal on tight scrap supply, said an executive from
Guangdong Qingyuan Yunnan Copper Nonferrous Metals Co.  “Scrap imports are too expensive, almost close to the
refined metal price, so traders are reluctant to import,” Tao
Yonghe, general manager of Guangdong Qingyuan, said in an
interview today. The company is a unit of Aluminum Corp. of
China, the nation’s biggest producer of the light metal.  Recycled copper accounts for about 35 percent of China’s
total refined output, and 60 percent of scrap supply is from
imports, according to the company, which has a recycling
capacity of 100,000 tons per year.  -- Helen Sun . Editors:  Richard Dobson , James Poole  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
