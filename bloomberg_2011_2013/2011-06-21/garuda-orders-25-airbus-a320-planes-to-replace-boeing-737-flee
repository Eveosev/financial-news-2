PT Garuda  Indonesia  ordered 25
Airbus SAS A320s, including 10 A320neos, as it replaces a fleet
of  Boeing Co. (BA)  single-aisle aircraft at its low-cost unit.  The contract, worth about $2.2 billion at list prices, also
includes options for another 25 A320neo planes, Garuda Chief
Financial Officer Elisa Lumbantoruan said by e-mail today. The
Citilink unit, which operates five 737s, will receive the new
Airbus aircraft from early 2014, he said.  The deal builds momentum for the A320neo after Toulouse-
based Airbus yesterday won 90 orders for the plane on the first
day of the  Paris Air Show . Boeing is deciding between joining
Airbus in offering a revamped single-aisle aircraft with new
engines and developing an all-new model.  Garuda, Indonesia’s biggest carrier, picked the Airbus
planes because of lower operating costs and because they were
more quickly available than Boeing models, Lumbantoruan said.
Slots for the 737 are sold out until 2016,  Jim Albaugh , the head
of Boeing’s commercial-plane unit, said in an interview
yesterday.  Airbus markets the A320neo as 15 percent more fuel
efficient than current planes. Deliveries of the new aircraft
are due to begin in 2015.  Citilink also plans to add four leased Airbus A320s this
year to support traffic growth that’s three times as fast as
last year, Garuda said earlier this month. The unit flies to
domestic cities including Jakarta, Surabaya and Denpasar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
