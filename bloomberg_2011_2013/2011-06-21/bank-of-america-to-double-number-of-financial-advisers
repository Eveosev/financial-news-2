Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  said it will
almost double its number of financial solutions advisers to more
than 1,000 by the end of 2011.  The company said the move was part of a plan to improve
 service  for what it calls preferred customers, or those with
investable assets of $50,000 to $250,000.  Editor: Bill Koenig  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
