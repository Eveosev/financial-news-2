The U.K. will push for an
agreement to improve market information and access when Group of
20 agriculture ministers meet tomorrow in Paris, according to
U.K. Agriculture Minister James Paice. He made the following
comments at a conference in London today:  The U.K. “will be pushing for an agreement on improving
market information and access, on reducing trade distorting
subsidies, and on reducing the need for export bans.  “This is the first time the agricultural ministers of the
G-20 have had a conference and that in itself is a significant
step forward. We do believe the French government has to
be encouraged in the leading role they are taking as president
in the G-20.  “I don’t pretend that it will achieve everything we want.
Transparency in terms of trade and volumes would be a major
step.  “Volatility happens in any market and you will never
eliminate it, but it’s not good for the producer, nor is it good
for the consumer. Transparency and understanding of global
stocks is the first part of trying to minimize the volatility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
