A majority of German business
leaders said they back a restructuring of  Greece ’s debt while
almost two-thirds predicted unbroken growth for the German
economy, a poll showed.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s approval rating declined in the
survey of 519 German company executives and state officials for
Capital magazine, which said that 87 percent believe Greece can
master its problems only by restructuring its debt. Sixty-four
percent are concerned for the euro’s stability, according to the
Allensbach Institute poll.  Merkel is viewed as a “weak” chancellor by 58 percent of
the group, the lowest rating since she took power in 2005, and
78 percent said they view her Christian Democrat-led coalition
as weak. One reason was her decision to cut short the use of
nuclear power in  Germany  after the Fukushima reactor meltdowns
in  Japan  in March.  “A distinct sense of frustration has taken hold,
especially among businesses,” Capital quoted Allensbach head
Renate Koecher as saying.  Even so, 62 percent of respondents said the German economy
will keep growing and 90 percent of the executives said orders
at their company are good or very good, the highest level since
the poll began more than 20 years ago.  The poll, which includes 77 executives of large German
companies, was conducted between May 25 and June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
