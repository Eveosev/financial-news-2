Bankers and economic officials are
discussing ways to swap Greek Treasury Bills for bonds held by
insurance funds, Euro2day  reported , without saying where it got
the information.  The swaps are needed because the  European Central Bank ’s
3.3 billion-euro ($4.7 billion) ceiling on the amount of T-Bills
it accepts for liquidity operations is causing problems for the
government’s T-Bill issuance program, the Athens-based news
website said.  The swaps would allow Greek banks, which buy the majority
of the T-Bills, to offer bonds as collateral instead, Euro2day
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
