U.S. vehicle thefts dropped to the
lowest since 1967, falling for a seventh straight year as more
cars were equipped with security devices and police tactics
helped deter thieves, an insurance industry group said.  Thefts probably declined 7.2 percent last year from 794,616
in 2009, according to preliminary figures released today by the
 National Insurance Crime Bureau . The New York City region,
 Dallas ,  Los Angeles ,  Detroit  and Miami were among 257 urban
areas reporting fewer thefts, the non-profit trade group said,
citing FBI data.  Insurers including  Allstate Corp. (ALL)  and State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Co. offer discounts to customers who use
anti-theft devices. In addition to built-in security features,
NICB recommends manufacturer-installed products such as LoJack
Corp. tracking devices and  Ravelco  ignition disablers.  “Technology both on the manufacturing end and what comes
out of the automakers is a lot better than it was,” Frank Scafidi, a spokesman for Des Plaines, Illinois-based NICB, said
in an interview. “Even on the baseline vehicle today, it’s
harder to steal than in 2000.”  Auto thefts in the New York City area, including northern
 New Jersey  and  Long Island , fell 1.9 percent to 29,189. The
region had the 198th-highest-rate of 366 Metropolitan
Statistical Areas, compared with 223rd in 2009.  State College ,
 Pennsylvania , had the lowest rate for the second straight year
with 46 thefts, or 30 per 100,000 people.  Bait Programs  Car thefts in Dallas declined 14.5 percent in 2010 to
21,963, or 345 thefts per 100,000 people, the NICB said. Police
use “bait programs” in which officers leave cars unlocked,
often with the keys still in the ignition, to tempt would-be
thieves. The tactic has helped reduce thefts, said Sgt. Robert
Benitez of the  Dallas Police Department .  Fresno, California -- one of eight regions in the state
among the top 10 places for car snatching -- had the highest
rate of theft. The Fresno area, in central California, had 7,559
thefts, or 812 per 100,000 people, the NICB said.  Law-enforcement efforts are hobbled by insufficient
capacity at the county jail resulting from staff shortages, said
Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer.  “Individuals we arrest for the crime of auto theft are
being booked into jail and released, generally the same day,”
he said in an interview. “It is not uncommon for us to arrest
the same person for auto theft multiple times in one
week.”  Sgt. Eddie Perez of  California ’s  Delano Police Department ,
in the Southern California region with the third-highest rate of
car thefts, said more automobile owners should take basic
precautions.  “The simplest, the easiest and the most cost-effective is
really just to lock the thing,” Scafidi said. “I know that
sounds kind of elementary, but there are lots of vehicles that
are stolen every year because people make it easy on the
thief.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
