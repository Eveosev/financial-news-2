Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-
largest bank, said it may cut all the 659 U.K. employees it
inherited with its purchase of the credit-card business Egg.  The bank may also close a site in Derby,  England  as part of
Egg’s integration with Barclaycard, Barclays said in a statement
on its  website  today. If the plan goes ahead, job cuts would
take place in stages over the remainder of this year, the
London-based company said.  Barclays agreed to buy the U.K. business from  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  in March to add 1.15 million accounts. Citigroup Chief
Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  has been selling units after the
New York-based bank received a $45 billion bailout from the U.S.
government.  “Our proposal to cease operations in Derby was a tough
decision to make,” Paula Gowland, operations director at
Barclaycard, said in the statement. “People were informed as
soon as the decision was made to give them as much time as
possible to consider their options.”  Employees will be informed about alternative jobs at other
Barclays sites in the U.K., the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
