South African consumer confidence
increased in the second quarter, indicating that household
spending will continue to support the recovery in  Africa ’s
biggest economy.  The FNB/BER consumer confidence index rose to 11 from 9 in
the previous three months, First National Bank and the  Bureau
for Economic Research  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Growth in gross domestic demand, which includes consumer,
government and investment spending, accelerated to an annualized
8.3 percent in the first quarter from 2.4 percent in the
previous three months, the  Reserve Bank  said today. The central
bank has maintained its key interest rate at a 30-year low of
5.5 percent this year as it seeks to bolster demand.  “Provided income growth in the economy continues to evolve
favorably, as it has since mid-2009, with retail and motor trade
credit remaining plentiful, the consumer-led revival is yet to
be checked to any major degree,”  First National Bank ’s Chief
Economist Cees Bruggemans said in the statement.  While South Africans became more optimistic about the
prospects for economic growth in the next year, they remained
“relatively prudent” in their purchases of durable goods, such
as TVs and furniture, in part because they expect  interest rates 
to increase soon, according to the statement.  Retail sales increased an annual 9.8 percent in April,
compared with 5.3 percent the month before, beating all
economist forecasts, the statistics office said on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
