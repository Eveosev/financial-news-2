Fortis Inc.,  Canada ’s biggest
publicly traded utility, lost its ownership interest in a  Belize 
power company after the Belize government seized the assets.  Fortis holds an approximate 70 percent interest in BEL, the
main electricity distributor in Belize, the  St. John’s ,
Newfoundland based-company said today in a statement. The stake
represents less than 2 percent of the company’s total assets of
C$12.9 billion ($13.3 billion) as of March 31, 2011, the company
said. A spokeswoman for Fortis did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.  The action stemmed from a dispute over a requested rate
increase in 2008, the government of Belize said in an e-mailed
statement. The government took over the company to ensure an
uninterrupted supply of electricity, said Joseph Waight,
financial secretary of the Belize Ministry of Finance, in a
telephone interview.  Fortis received notification of Belize’s asset possession
today, the company said. The government of Belize has not served
an expropriation order for Fortis’s ownership of Belize Electric
Company Ltd., a non-regulated business that operates three
hydroelectric plants in the Central American country.  Fortis fell 3 cents to C$32.01 at 4:10 p.m. in trading on
the Toronto Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
