HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) ’s Tanzanian unit
may close its Wazo Hill plant unless the government removes 952
people illegally occupying its premises, the Dar es Salaam-based
 Guardian  reported, citing Sam Mapande, the company’s lawyer.  The squatters refused to move until the government pays
them compensation following a dispute over ownership of the
land, the newspaper said. In 2008, a domestic court ruled that
the company is the owner of the land and the government promised
to relocate the villagers, it said.  The state may lose 25 billion shillings ($15.6 million) in
annual tax revenue if the factory closes, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
