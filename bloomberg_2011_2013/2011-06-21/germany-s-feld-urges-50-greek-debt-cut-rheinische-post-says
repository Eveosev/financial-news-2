Greek debt must be restructured as
soon as possible and should include a reduction by about half,
Lars Feld, a member of the German government’s council of
economic advisers, said, Rheinische Post reported, citing an
interview.  The European Union must first stabilize the area’s banks to
prepare them for a possible Greek default, the newspaper cited
Feld as saying in a preview of an article to appear in today’s
edition. The debt restructuring should take place in the first
half of 2012 at the latest, Rheinische Post cited Feld as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
