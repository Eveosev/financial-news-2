BP Plc (BP/)  rose from a six-month low
after Weatherford International Ltd. agreed to pay the oil
company $75 million to cover its liability for any current or
future claims related to the Macondo oil spill.  BP jumped 16.1 pence, or 3.7 percent, to 445.7 pence as of
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London . The stock has fallen 4.3 percent
since the beginning of the year, valuing the company at 84.1
billion pounds ($136.5 billion).  The agreement is the second reached by London-based BP in a
month with a partner or contractor on the well. Geneva-based
Weatherford provided the equipment used when the Macondo well in
the Gulf of Mexico exploded. The payment will be added to a $20
billion trust for claims stemming from the biggest offshore U.S.
oil spill.  “Weatherford is the first of BP’s contractors to formally
agree with BP that the entire industry can and should learn from
the Deepwater Horizon incident,” Investec analyst  Richard Griffith  said in a note to investors today.  Companies including Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Transocean
Ltd. and Halliburton Co. are likely to face increased pressure
to come to an agreement with BP, he said. The  oil company 
announced an agreement on May 20 in which a unit of Mitsui & Co.
would pay $1.07 billion for spill costs related to MOEX Offshore
2007 LLC’s 10 percent stake in Macondo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
