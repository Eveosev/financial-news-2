Units of U.S. Bancorp and East West
Bancorp created a fund to finance about 9 megawatts of projects
for Borrego Solar Systems Inc. in  Massachusetts ,  New Jersey  and
 California .  The $46 million fund follows $56 million in project
financing that U.S. Bank and East West Bank previously provided
the company, Jessica Elkus, a spokeswoman for Berkeley,
California-based Borrego, said in an e-mail.  Borrego installs, maintains, and operates grid-tied
photovoltaic systems for commercial and government customers.
Through a financing arrangement known as a power purchase
agreement, the companyâ€™s customers pay no installation costs and
buy the generated electricity at a fixed monthly rate that is
lower than a typical utility bill, according to the company. It
serves customers in California, New England, and the Mid-
Atlantic U.S.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
