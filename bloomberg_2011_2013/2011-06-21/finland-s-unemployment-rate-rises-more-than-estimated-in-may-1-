Finland ’s jobless rate rose more
than expected last month as students joined the workforce to
look for summer jobs and as private sector demand for labor
waned.  The  unemployment rate , which isn’t adjusted for seasonal
variations, increased to 9.8 percent in May from 8.2 percent in
April, Helsinki-based  Statistics Finland  said on its website
today. The median estimate of four economists was for a rate of
9.5 percent last month. The rate was 10.5 percent a year ago.  Finland’s economy won’t grow enough to fill the gap between
revenue and spending and Jyrki Katainen’s new government must
take “firm measures” to fill the shortfall, the  Finance
Ministry  said yesterday. Bank of Finland Governor Erkki Liikanen
warned last week the country, one of only six AAA rated euro
members, may need to resort to “emergency action” if
politicians don’t act “promptly” to address Finland’s
demographic challenges.  “More than half of the jobs were created in the public
sector in May,” Reijo Heiskanen, chief economist at OP-Pohjola
Group said in a telephone interview in Helsinki today. “This
isn’t a beneficial trend for the sustainability of public
finances.”  Finland’s economy, burdened with the fastest-aging
population in  Europe , will expand 3.9 percent this year as the
economy rebounds from its record 8.2 percent slump in 2009.
Growth will slow to 2.8 percent next year and 2.4 percent in
2013, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
