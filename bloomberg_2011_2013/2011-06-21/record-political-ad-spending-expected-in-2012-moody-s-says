Spending on U.S. political
advertising will surge to record highs in 2012 as campaign-
spending caps are eliminated, Moody’s Investors Service says.  Corporations and unions can spend unlimited money on the
2012 presidential election and Congressional races for the first
time in more than a decade, Moody’s analyst Carl Salas, based in
 New York , wrote in a note to clients. The rule change, resulting
from a January 2010 decision from the U.S. Supreme Court, will
likely lead to an increase in spending of 9 percent to 18
percent over 2010’s record levels, he wrote.  Political spending in 2010, a year without a presidential
election, was about $2.3 billion, breaking 2008’s record of
about $2 billion, according to the Moody’s note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
