Pablo Picasso ’s portraits of three
different lovers raised 42.2 million pounds ($68.5 million) last
night in London as collectors of the Spanish artist battled for
paintings and led demand for 20th-century artworks.  Christie’s International’s three-hour auction of modern and
Impressionist art totaled 140 million pounds, including 40 lots
from the estate of the Swiss art dealer Ernst Beyeler, who died
last year. The Basel-based gallerist’s material contributed 44.7
million pounds with only one piece failing to sell -- a  Claude Monet  water-lily painting.  “The market is strong,” the New York-based dealer Tony Shafrazi said. “The media is panicking about the economy, and
yet there’s a lot of hidden money out there.”  Picasso is the world’s most heavily traded modern artist at
auction. Wealthy investment-conscious collectors looking for a
hedge against recession are attached to his trophy works,
particularly when they depict his lovers. The 1932 painting of
Marie-Therese Walter, “Nude,  Green Leaves  and Bust” fetched
$106.5 million -- the most for any artwork at auction -- at
Christie’s,  New York , in May 2010.  A 1939 painting of Dora Maar, “Femme assise, robe bleue,”
showing Picasso’s lover on a chair sporting a purple hat, sold 
yesterday for 18 million pounds, against an estimate of 4 
million pounds to 8 million pounds. It had been acquired by 
the seller’s family from Beyeler in about 1968.  The new buyer was the Swiss-based Greek collector Dimitri Mavrommatis, bidding by telephone to Thomas Seydoux, Christie’s
international head of Impressionist and modern art, the auction
house said after the sale.  Marie, Dora  Two lots earlier, the London-based dealer Alan Hobart of
the  Pyms Gallery  paid 13.5 million pounds for Picasso’s 1935
painting “Jeune fille endormie,” showing the artist’s mistress
Walter snoozing on her folded arms.  Valued at 9 million pounds to 12 million pounds, the canvas
was sold by an anonymous owner who is donating proceeds to the
 University of Sydney  to fund medical research.  “The Maar was the best of tonight’s Picassos,” said Guy Jennings, partner in London-based dealers  Theobald Jennings .
“The market is sane and solid, and slightly stronger than it
was in May in New York.” Jennings was one of several dealers
who noticed Asian clients bidding on “entry level” works by
modern masters. A Picasso print priced at 67,250 pounds was one
of 4 percent of the lots that went to Asian buyers. European
bidders bought 54 percent of the works, with the remaining 42
percent falling to the U.S., said Christie’s.  Francoise Gillot  The most expensive Beyeler lot was the 1946 painting “Bust
de Francoise,” showing Picasso’s lover Francoise Gillot seated
in a white chair. The oil-on-board work had been acquired from
the artist’s daughter,  Maya Widmaier-Picasso , in 1997 and sold
to the New York-based dealer  Acquavella Galleries  for 10.7
million pounds, against a high estimate of 10 million pounds.  Monet’s 7-foot-wide (2.1 meter) “Nympheas” painting,
dating from about 1914 to 1917, had been bought by Beyeler for
stock from a Paris dealer in 1981. Unfinished and with a stamped
signature, it failed to attract a bid against an estimate of 17
million pounds to 24 million pounds. Monet’s late water lily
paintings have been given hefty valuations after Christie’s sold
the 1919 “Le Bassin aux Nympheas” for a record 40.9 million
pounds in June 2008.  “The Beyeler works weren’t fresh to the market and most of
them were selling the right prices,” Jennings said. “The Monet
was just a bit overvalued, and then there were some silly prices
for smaller things with personal associations.”  A Diego Giacometti glass-topped table with base in the form
of a bronze tree sold to a telephone bidder for 646,050 pounds,
against a valuation of 50,000 pounds to 70,000 pounds. The
dealer’s 17th-century Spanish walnut desk reached 289,250
pounds, more than 10 times the upper estimate of 20,000 pounds.  Macke, Klee  August Macke  and  Paul Klee  were among five artists who
reached new auction highs. The short-lived Macke’s vibrant 1914
watercolor “Im Bazar” sold to a telephone bidder for 4 million
pounds, five times the upper estimate. Klee’s 1932 painting of a
dancer sold for 4.2 million pounds to an unidentified bidder in
the room, doubling the low estimate. The Klee’s European seller
had acquired the canvas from Galerie Beyeler in 1979.  Christie’s sold 87 percent of its 92 lots, achieving a
total that was the third highest for an auction in this category
held by the company in London. The total with fees fell in the
middle of the estimate of 114.7 million pounds to 144.4 million
pounds, based on hammer prices.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
