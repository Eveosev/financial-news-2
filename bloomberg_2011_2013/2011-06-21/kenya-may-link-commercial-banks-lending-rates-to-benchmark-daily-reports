Commercial banks in  Kenya  may be
required to peg their lending rates to a benchmark with a
clearly defined spread under new rules being considered by the
country’s Treasury, Business Daily reported.  The government wants the pricing of loans to be made as
transparent as possible, similar to other countries where short-
term loans are priced using the London Interbank Overnight Rate,
the Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing Henry Rotich, deputy
economic secretary in the Treasury.  Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki said yesterday there was an
“urgent need” for commercial banks to cut rates to spur
economic growth.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
