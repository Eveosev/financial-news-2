Petroleos Mexicanos ,  Latin America ’s
largest oil producer, said it will rent eight offshore drilling
rigs for more than $1.2 billion.  The state-owned company will publish a bidding schedule in
July and plans to begin operating the rigs at the end of this
year and 2012’s first quarter, it said today in a statement. The
company will seek seven platforms that can operate at a depth of
105 meters (344 feet) and one at 90 meters.  Pemex, based in Mexico City, plans to spend $23 billion
this year to boost oil production. Output dropped to 2.576
million barrels a day in 2010, the lowest daily average since
1990, and has slipped for six straight years.  Pemex also plans to buy five land-drilling rigs for about
$200 million, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
