Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell a
cargo of  North Sea  Forties crude after yesterday’s transaction.
Glencore International Plc sought to buy Russian Urals in the
Mediterranean without success.  North Sea  Trafigura didn’t manage to sell one cargo of Forties for
loading July 8 to July 10 at parity to Dated Brent, according to
a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading
window. Yesterday it sold one shipment at a discount of 8 cent.  Vitol Group failed to buy Forties for July 11 to July 14 at
5 cents below Dated Brent, while Royal Dutch Shell Plc was
unable to buy at 10 cents less than the benchmark for July 10 to
July 12, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days cost 8 cents less
than Dated Brent, the lowest since March 25, compared with a
premium of 7 cents yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.  Brent for August settlement traded at $111.88 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the
window, down from $112.19 on June 17. The September contract was
at $111.46, 35 cents less than August.  Buzzard crude’s share in the Forties oil blend fell to 21
percent last week from 25 percent in the period to June 12,
according to BP Plc. Daily Forties production is forecast to
increase to 461,000 barrels in September from 399,000 barrels in
August, BP said in a posting today on its website.  Oil from Buzzard, the biggest in the Forties blend, will
account for 25 percent of total production in September,
compared with 40 percent a month earlier, BP said.  Mediterranean/Urals  Glencore was unable to buy 80,000 metric tons of Urals in
the Mediterranean for July 3 to July 7 delivery at $2.55 a
barrel below Dated Brent, according to the survey. Yesterday
Shell sought to sell at $1.90 less than the benchmark without
success.  No bids or offers were made for Urals in northwest Europe
for the fourth session.  West  Africa   Nigeria , Africa’s largest oil producer, plans to export 7.7
million barrels of Agbami condensate, or light crude, in August,
1.3 percent less than July, a loading schedule obtained by
Bloomberg News showed.  Agbami’s shipping program comprises seven cargoes of
975,000 barrels, one of 500,000 barrels and one of 375,000.  The West African nation will also export one consignment of
700,000 barrels of Abo crude and three 950,000-barrels of Yoho
shipments, according to the plan.  Equatorial Guinea  will keep exports of its Zafiro and Ceiba
crude unchanged in August from July, according to shipping
schedules. The country will ship four cargoes of Zafiro crude
and three consignments of Ceiba, the programs showed. All
cargoes are 1 million barrels each.  Chad  will export four 950,000-barrel shipments of Doba
crude in August, one more than July, according to the plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
