Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
 Latin America ’s largest publicly traded utility, climbed the
most in eight months after its first-quarter earnings beat
analysts’ estimates.  Eletrobras, as the utility is known, rose 14 centavos, or
0.8 percent, to 20.80 reais at 12:33 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading.
Earlier, the stock jumped as much as 4 percent, the most since
Oct. 26.  Eletrobras’s net income jumped almost eightfold to 1.28
billion reais in the first quarter, from 163.5 million reais a
year earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said today in a
statement. The company was expected to report profit on an
adjusted basis of 799.7 million reais, the median of three
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Net sales jumped 40 percent to 7.89 billion reais, the
company said.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
