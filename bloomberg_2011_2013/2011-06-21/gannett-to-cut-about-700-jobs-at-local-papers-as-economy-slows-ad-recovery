Gannett Co., publisher of 82
newspapers including  USA Today , is cutting about 700 jobs at its
community-newspaper unit as it struggles with continuing
weakness in local and national advertising.  Gannett is reducing staff because the economic recovery is
not happening “as quickly or favorably as we had hoped,” Bob Dickey, president of Gannett’s U.S. community publishing
division, said in a memo. The division includes the Cincinnati
Enquirer and Indianapolis Star.  “While we are seeing improved circulation results and
audience growth, weakness in the real estate sector, slow  job
creation  and now softer auto ad demand continue to challenge
revenue growth in the division,” Dickey said. “National
advertising remains soft and with many of our local advertisers
reducing their overall budgets, we need to take further steps to
align our costs with the current revenue trends.”  Gannett’s revenue declined for four years in a row to $5.44
billion in 2010, from $7.44 billion in 2007. In the first
quarter, revenue dropped 3.7 percent to $1.25 billion and net
income fell 23 percent to $90.5 million.  Gannett closed up 40 cents, or 2.9 percent, at $14.16 in
New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock has declined 6.2
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
