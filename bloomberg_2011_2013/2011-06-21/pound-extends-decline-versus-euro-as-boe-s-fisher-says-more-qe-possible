The pound extended a decline against
the euro after Bank of England Markets Director  Paul Fisher  said
he’s “wary” about deflation and that further quantitative
easing is a possibility.  The pound depreciated 0.5 percent to 88.70 pence per euro
as of 9:48 a.m. in  London , the weakest level since June 10.
Sterling declined 0.1 percent to $1.6179 and 0.2 percent to
129.77 yen.  U.K. government bonds were little changed with the 10-year
yield at 3.23 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
