Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co. (TEL)  and  Globe Telecom Inc. (GLO)  jumped on reports the Appeals Court
dismissed a rival’s complaint and upheld a 2005 regulator’s
decision to award 3G mobile-phone service licenses to the two
companies.  Philippine Long Distance advanced 5.5 percent to 2,322
pesos at 11:49 a.m. local time, set for the sharpest gain since
March 30. Globe Telecom climbed 2.9 percent to 867 pesos,
heading for the steepest rise since May 26.  The Court of Appeals rejected Multimedia Telephony Inc.’s
petition and ruled that the regulator’s decision to award the
licenses was “reasonable and made pursuant to its quasi-
judicial powers,” the newspaper said, citing the court.  Philippine Long Distance, Globe, Digital Telecommunications
Philippines Inc. and Connectivity Unlimited Resource Enterprises
were give the licenses in 2005 allowing them to offer high-speed
mobile-phone  Internet access , the daily said.  Appeals Court Associate Justice Mario Guarina III, who
wrote the decision, couldn’t be reached for comment at his
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
