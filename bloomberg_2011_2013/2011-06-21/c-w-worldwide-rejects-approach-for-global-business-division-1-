Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/)  has
noted recent press speculation in relation to an approach for
its global business division, it said in a statement, adding
that its board “considered and rejected that approach.”  The Financial Times reported on June 19 that the U.K.
telecommunications company is considering selling most of its
international assets.  The newspaper said Pacnet Ltd., a telecommunications group
based in  Hong Kong  and Singapore, made an informal offer of $500
million for C&W’s overseas businesses. Both companies declined
to comment, the FT said.  C&W Worldwide said on May 24 that full-year earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other items rose
2.6 percent to 442 million pounds ($718 million) in the 12
months through March, beating analysts’ estimates for earnings
of 441.5 million pounds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
