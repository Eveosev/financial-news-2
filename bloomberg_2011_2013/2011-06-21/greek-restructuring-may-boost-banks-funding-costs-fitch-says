Banks outside  Greece  may face higher
funding costs if a restructuring or rollover of the country’s
debt is “disorderly,” Fitch Ratings analysts said.  About 37 billion euros ($53 billion) of Greek sovereign
debt is held by 34 major European banks outside the country,
Fitch analysts’ including James Longsdon said in a statement.
Though a restructuring would have “minor direct consequences”
to the banks’ solvency, a long period of  risk aversion  would
make more European lenders prone to negative ratings actions.  “Provided contagion risks can be relatively quickly
contained, most major European banks should be able to absorb
the immediate credit, market and liquidity risks of a Greek
sovereign debt restructuring or rollover with minor, if any,
negative rating actions,” Longsdon said in the statement.  Cypriot banks or smaller Spanish lenders would be the first
non-Greek institutions to suffer negative ratings actions due to
their Greek holdings, Fitch said. If contagion risk increases,
banks with direct exposure to peripheral European countries also
may be affected, Fitch said without identifying any lenders.  Greece’s five biggest banks hold about 45 billion euros of
the country’s debt and have their ratings “tightly tied” to
the sovereign’s, Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
