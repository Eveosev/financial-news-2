Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE) , Spain’s
biggest toll-road operator, said its partnership with a  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  unit was chosen as preferred bidder for two
highways in  Puerto Rico .  Abertis, which holds 45 percent of the bidding group, and
Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners II, with 55 percent, will
run the island commonwealth’s PR-22 and PR-5 highways for 40
years, Barcelona-based Abertis said in a  statement  today. The
contract is scheduled to be awarded by the end of September, the
Spanish company said.  About 40 percent of the project, which involves a $1.08
billion concession fee, will be financed with capital by the
partnership, with the rest funded with long-term debt, Abertis
said. The group already has financing offers from 12 financial
institutions, it said. The Spanish company’s credit ratings are
unlikely to be affected by the transaction, Abertis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
