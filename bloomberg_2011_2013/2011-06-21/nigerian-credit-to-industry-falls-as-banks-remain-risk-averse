Nigerian credit to private industry
fell in May from the year earlier, even as the state bought bad
debts from ailing banks and the  money supply  swelled.  Credit to the private sector declined an annual 1.6 percent
to 9.85 trillion naira (64 billion dollars), according to a
 report  from the central bank today. Broad money supply rose 11.5
percent over the same period, the fastest rate in seven months,
the bank said.  “The decline in credit to private sector arises from the
fact that liquidity is not translating to credit,”  Bismarck Rewane , chief executive of Financial Derivatives Co., said by
phone today. “The environment has to be OK for the banks to
make credit.”  Nigerian banks have become increasingly risk averse as they
rebuild their balance sheets following the near collapse of the
industry in 2009, the central bank governor, Lamido Sanusi, said
last month. Many banks still have negative capital and need to
recapitalise to grow their businesses or risk liquidation,
Sanusi said on June 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
