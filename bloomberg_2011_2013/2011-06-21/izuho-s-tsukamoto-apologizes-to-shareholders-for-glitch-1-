Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  Chief
Executive Officer  Takashi Tsukamoto  apologized to shareholders
for a computer systems failure at its retail banking unit that
delayed transactions following a record earthquake in March.  He was speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting
in Tokyo today. Shareholders will consider whether to approve
the company’s proposal to replace Tsukamoto with Yasuhiro Sato,
currently CEO of Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.  Mizuho, Japan’s third-biggest bank by market value, said on
May 23 that it will combine some functions at its corporate,
retail and trust units to improve operations after the
malfunctions disrupted transactions worth more than $10 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
