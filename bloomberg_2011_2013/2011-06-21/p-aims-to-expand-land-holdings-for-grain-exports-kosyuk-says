Mironovskiy Hleboproduct SA, a
Ukrainian agriculture company, plans to expand its land holdings
in the next few years to boost grain exports, Chief Executive
Officer Yuriy Kosyuk said.  Local land holdings may increase to 500,000 hectares (1.2
million acres) from 300,000 hectares, Kosyuk said yesterday in
an interview at his Kiev office. Grain exports this year may
jump to 700,000 metric tons from 250,000 tons last year, he
said.  Ukraine may have a grain harvest of 60 million tons “in a
couple of years,” the CEO said. This year’s harvest is
estimated at between 42 million and 43 million tons by the
country’s hydrometeorology center.  MHP climbed 22 percent in the past year in London trading,
increasing the company’s market value to $1.85 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
