Mongolia Energy Corp., a mineral and
energy explorer, advanced the most in more than two years in
Hong Kong trading after announcing a 5.4 percent increase in its
coal deposits.  The shares rose 27 percent to HK$1.18, the biggest gain
since May 20, 2009. That compares with the 1.2 percent increase
in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  The energy explorer, which operates in Mongolia and  China â€™s
western Xinjiang province, said in a statement dated June 17
that coal resources rose to 141,456 metric tons as of last month
from 134,170 tons in June 2008.  Shares of the company have fallen 51 percent this year,
compared with the 6.7 percent decline in the Hang Seng Index.  Mongolia Energy said on June 1 that it may report a loss
for the year ended March 31 because of increased staffing,
financing costs and losses from trading investments. The energy
explorer reported a loss of HK$317 million ($41 million) in the
previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
