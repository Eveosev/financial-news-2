Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s largest
maker of heavy-duty vehicles, plans to sell 20 percent more
Mercedes-Benz trucks this year, boosted by demand for a revamped
version of the long-haul Actros model.  Daimler spent more than 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) to
develop and assemble the 18-ton truck, which will reduce fuel
consumption compared with the current, 15-year-old version by as
much as 7 percent, the Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker said
today in a statement.  “Freight-forwarding companies are now getting a boost”
from the recovering global economy,  Andreas Renschler , head of
the Daimler Trucks division, said in a speech at the unveiling
in Brussels. “This is having a positive impact on truck
manufacturers as well.”  Growth in the European market for trucks weighing 6 tons or
more will exceed 25 percent this year, Daimler said. The
automaker overhauled the Actros, which goes on sale July 1, to
meet tighter European Union environmental rules. The truck is
the first model capable of meeting so-called Euro VI emissions
standards, which will take effect by 2014, the automaker said.  Because the new regulations require more equipment, which
adds costs and may increase fuel consumption, governments should
provide incentives to freight companies to buy new trucks,
Renschler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
