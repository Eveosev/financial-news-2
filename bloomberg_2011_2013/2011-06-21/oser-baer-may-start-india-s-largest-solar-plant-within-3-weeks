Moser Baer Ltd.,  India ’s second-
largest maker of solar cells, plans to start the country’s
biggest solar-power plant in the next three weeks.  “Commissioning is subject to grid connection,” K.N.
Subramaniam, chief executive officer of the company’s solar
photovoltaic division, said in an interview today in  New Delhi .
“That shouldn’t be a problem.”  The 30-megawatt project in the western state of Gujarat
would be India’s largest solar photovoltaic plant to date,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Photovoltaic plants directly convert sunlight into electricity
using semiconductors.  Moser Baer was up 3.2 percent at 38.65 rupees at 1:25 p.m.
in Mumbai trading after rising as much as 5.2 percent. The
benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange gained 1
percent.  The project will use thin-film panels that are coated with
a layer of semiconductor material to absorb sunlight. Moser Baer
is using 10 megawatts each of panels made by  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) ,
the world’s largest maker of the thin-film devices, and DuPont
Co., the third-biggest U.S. chemical maker, as well as its own
panels, Subramaniam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
