Chile ’s peso strengthened versus the
 U.S. dollar , ending four days of losses, as a rise on the euro
and commodity prices spurred demand for riskier emerging-market
assets.  The peso rose 0.3 percent to 470.78 per dollar at 10:08
a.m. New York time from 472.25 per dollar yesterday. The peso
weakened 1.3 percent in the previous four sessions.  “The peso is gaining slightly in line with the euro,
copper prices and equities,” Cristian Donoso, a trader at the
brokerage unit of lender  Banco de Chile (CHILE) , said in a telephone
interview. He added that the next meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee, which begins today, may have an effect on the
 exchange rate  by strengthening the peso if the Fed decides to
extend stimulus programs.  The euro rose as much as 0.6 percent versus the dollar as
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou seeks to secure support
for his government’s austerity measures, which include a 78
billion euro ($112 billion) package of budget cuts to ensure the
payment of a fifth loan under last year’s 110 billion euro
bailout.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, rose in
New York and London, rebounding from a three-week low, on
reduced concern of a Greek default.  The FOMC meets today and will announce its rate decision
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
