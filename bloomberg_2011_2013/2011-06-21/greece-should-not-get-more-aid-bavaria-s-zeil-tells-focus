Greece  shouldn’t be granted new aid
and the Mediterranean nation should restructure all of its debt
as signs mount that it can’t withstand further fiscal
tightening,  Bavaria ’s Finance Minister Martin Zeil told  Focus
Money .  A new aid package will be tied to a new budget squeeze that
Greece cannot withstand, the politician is cited as saying in a
guest column. Zeil is a member of the Free Democratic Party, the
junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
