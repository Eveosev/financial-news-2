The Czech Republic’s benchmark stock
index advanced the most in more than four months, led by banks,
as speculation Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will win a
confidence vote boosted demand for Europe’s assets.  The PX equity gauge jumped 1.5 percent, the most since Feb.
4, to 1,230 at its 4:28 p.m. close in  Prague .  Erste Group Bank
AG (EBS)  and  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  surged more than 2.2 percent each, the
lenders’ biggest one-day gain in more than two months.  Equities rallied worldwide and the euro strengthened amid
expectations that the Greek parliament will back Papandreou’s
cabinet reshuffle and austerity measures that could help the
country avoid a default. Stocks in Europe pared losses late
yesterday after Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker 
said a solution will be found to Greece’s debt crisis.  “Hope that the Greek government will win the parliament’s
confidence has helped stock markets today,” Miroslav Adamkovic,
an analyst at Komercni Banka AS in Prague, wrote in a report to
clients. “The PX gauge has also experienced strong growth.”  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech power utility, added 1.1 percent
to 901.9 koruna, its strongest close since June 2. Telefonica
Czech Republic AS, the largest phone operator, also rose 1.1
percent to 429.7 koruna, the highest price since September 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
