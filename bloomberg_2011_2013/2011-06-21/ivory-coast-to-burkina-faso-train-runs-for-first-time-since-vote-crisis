A train from  Burkina Faso’s  capital,
Ouagadougou left today for Abidjan,  Ivory Coast ’s commercial
capital, for the first time since the end of the Ivorian post-
election conflict, said Paulin Wango, director of the Societe de
Transport Ivoiro-Burkinabe.  “There were passengers, export products and equipment
inside,” he said by phone. “It is a test to see if effectively
everything is back to normal again.”  The railway halted service in March amid  Ivory Coast’s  4
1/2-month crisis that sparked violence between supporters of
 Alassane Ouattara , who won the November vote, and Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbent who refused to cede power.  Landlocked Burkina Faso,  Africa ’s biggest cotton producer,
relies on access to Ivory Coast’s ports for both imports of
goods and exports of its commodities. More than 60 percent of
Burkinabe imports and exports pass through the harbor at
Abidjan, said Hyacinthe Ouedraogo, director-general of the
inland port at Bobo Dioulasso,  Burkina Faso ’s second-biggest
city.  The road corridor reopened in May, with shipments of goods
including fertilizer and cement being received, Ouedraogo said
by phone today.  In recent days, “cashew nuts which were stored in Bobo
Dioulasso for a long time left for Ivory Coast,” he said.  Ouattara was sworn in as president of Ivory Coast on May
21, following the April capture of Gbagbo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
