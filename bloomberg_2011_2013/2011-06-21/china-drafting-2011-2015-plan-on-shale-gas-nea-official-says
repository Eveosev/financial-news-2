China  is drafting a plan to develop
domestic shale-gas reserves during the five-year period ending
in 2015 as demand rises in the world’s largest energy consumer,
a government official said.  The government may offer financial support and tax
incentives to spur domestic explorers to extract shale gas, Yang
Lei, director of oil and natural gas at the National Energy
Administration, said at a conference in Beijing today.  PetroChina Co.,  Asia ’s largest oil producer, is leading
companies to tap unconventional gas resources, including gas in
shale rock, to help cut reliance on oil and coal. China may have
26 trillion cubic meters of shale-gas reserves, more than 10
times its proven holdings of conventional natural gas, Zhang Dawei, deputy director of oil and gas strategy research at the
Ministry of Land and Resources, said in April.  “We’ll also make shale-gas development more economical,
such as building the infrastructure required to transport the
shale gas,” Yang said.  PetroChina’s parent, China National Petroleum Corp., and
Royal Dutch Shell Plc are currently exploring the Jinqiu shale-
gas block in southwestern Sichuan province. Shell and PetroChina
are already operating the Changbei tight-gas field in the Ordos
Basin in northern Shaanxi province and exploring the Fushun-
Yongchuan block in Sichuan.  “Foreign companies are welcome to jointly explore for
shale gas with Chinese  oil companies ,” Yang said.  --Chua Baizhen and  Wang Ying  in Beijing. Editors: Ryan Woo,  Jane Lee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
