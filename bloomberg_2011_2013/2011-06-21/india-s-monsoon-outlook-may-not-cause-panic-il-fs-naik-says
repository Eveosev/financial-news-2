Suhas Naik, chief operating officer
at IL&FS Portfolio Management Services Ltd., which manages $100
million in assets, comments on the outlook for Indian equities
after the weather bureau said monsoon rainfall may be less than
the long-term average this year.  Precipitation in the June-September rainy season, the main
source of irrigation for the nation’s 235 million farmers, may
be 95 percent of the 50-year average, the weather office said
in a statement today after markets closed. Showers would be 98
percent of the long-period average, the office said April 19.  “There possibly will be a negative reaction in the market
on the news as the overall mood is gloomy, but there won’t be a
substantial downside. The downscale in forecast isn’t too
significant for investors to panic, but they will definitely
continue to stay cautious.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
rose 0.3 percent to 17,560.3 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai.
The gauge has declined 14 percent this year, the worst performer
in  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
