Serbian commercial lenders’ gross
profit rose 38 percent in the first quarter on rising interest
income and an improved loan business, the central bank said.  The 33 banks active on the market posted a combined 9.6
billion-dinar ($138 million) profit in the period, the central
bank said. The top performers were the local units of Banca
Intesa SpA,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Raiffeisen Bank International
AG (RBI) , with pre-tax earnings of 2.7 billion dinars, 1.6 billion
dinars and 1.4 billion dinars respectively,  Narodna Banka
Srbije  said on its web site today.  Interest income rose 13 percent while loan losses were
reduced 23 percent from a year ago, the central bank said.
Fees and commissions rose 0.6 percent, on average.  “A stable growth of income from interest, enhanced by
substantially lower net losses due to improved placements, was
the key factor for continued recovery of profitability in the
banking sector,” the central bank said.  Ten banks reported losses for the first three months,
including the subsidiaries of  Hungary ’s  OTP Bank PLC (OTP) ,  Greece ’
 Alpha Bank AE (ALPHA)  and Marfin Popular Bank PCL.  Combined assets of the banks declined 3.2 percent in the
period to 2.453 trillion dinars. Banca Intesa AD remained the
biggest by assets, with 343 billion dinars, or 14 percent of
the entire sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
