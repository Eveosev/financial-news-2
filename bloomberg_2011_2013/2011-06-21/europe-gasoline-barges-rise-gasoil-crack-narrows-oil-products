Norway’s Statoil ASA bought a cargo
of naphtha in northwest  Europe  from Glencore International AG.
The fuel’s discount to  Brent crude  narrowed.  Vitol Group bought a cargo of diesel from Litasco, a unit
of  Russia ’s OAO Lukoil. Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining
profitability, narrowed.  Light Products  Statoil paid $924 a metric ton for 12,500 tons of naphtha,
priced for delivery to Rotterdam from July 7 to July 11,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. That
compares with a deal on June 15 at $961 a ton.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent decreased to $8.03 a barrel
from $8.47 yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., an
oil and refined products broker in  London . That’s the lowest
margin since June 7.  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $977 to $991 a ton, according to a
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board and Platts. That compares with yesterday’s deals from $984
to $989 a ton.  The trades are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added
to make finished motor fuel, and are typically for lots of 1,000
tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack decreased to $5.96 a barrel from $6.24
yesterday, according to PVM data.  Middle Distillates  Vitol bought as much as 30,000 tons of diesel at $42 a ton
above July gasoil, priced for delivery to the Turkish port of
Aliaga from July 4 to July 8, according to the survey of Platts.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges changed hands at $24 to $27
a ton more than July gasoil, the survey showed. That compares
with yesterday’s deals at premiums of $26 and $27.  Gasoil for July dropped 2 percent to $914 a ton as of 5:02
p.m. local time on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract for August decreased 2 percent to $918 a ton. Brent for
August settlement declined 0.7 percent to $110.94 a barrel.  The fuel’s crack narrowed to $12.37 a barrel at 4:30 p.m.
London time compared with $13.64 at the same time yesterday,
according to data on the ICE exchange.  Gasoil barges traded at discounts of $4.50 and $6 a ton to
July gasoil, according to the survey of Platts. That compares
with yesterday’s deals at $7 to $8 below gasoil futures.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded from $611.50 to $614 a ton, the
survey of Platts showed. That compares with yesterday’s deals
from $611 to $620 a ton.  Pipeline Leak  Italy’s Saras SpA said an oil pipeline leak at its Sarroch
refinery in Sardinia was “negligible” and didn’t affect
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
