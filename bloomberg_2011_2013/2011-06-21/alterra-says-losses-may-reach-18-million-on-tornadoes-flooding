Alterra Capital Holdings Ltd. (ALTE) , the
Bermuda-based reinsurer, expects to lose $18 million to $28
million before taxes because of costs tied to tornadoes and
other severe U.S. storms in April and May.  The prediction, which also cited recent flooding along the
 Mississippi River , assumes total insured losses from the storms
of $11 billion to $18 billion, Alterra said today in a Business
Wire statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
