New South Wales Waratahs captain
Phil Waugh said he’ll retire from professional rugby at the end
of the 2011 season and wants to end his career as a member of
 Australia ’s  World Cup  squad.  The 31-year-old openside flanker, who’s played a record 131
Super Rugby matches for the Waratahs and 79 Tests for Australia,
said the timing was right “to make the transition into the next
chapter of my life.” He said he plans to start a corporate
career and is in negotiations with several companies.  “In terms of rugby I hope that my fondest memories occur
over the coming months,” Waugh, who won the John Eales Medal in
2003 as Australian rugby’s best and fairest player, said at a
televised news conference in Sydney. “I’m looking forward to
finishing on a high.”  The Waratahs, who’ve never won the southern hemisphere’s
elite provincial competition, face the Auckland Blues in three
days in the opening qualifying final. The Wallabies’ first game
of 2011 is July 17 against Samoa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
