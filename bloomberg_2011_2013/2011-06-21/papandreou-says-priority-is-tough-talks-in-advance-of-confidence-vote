Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said  Greece  faced tough talks with its European
partners to emerge from its financial crisis, and that saving
Greece was the priority.                 “If we give up in the middle of the road, history will
judge us harshly,” Papandreou said as a three-day debate
on a vote of confidence in his government drew to a close today.
“The impression the political class in this country gives is
that it hasn’t understood the seriousness of the crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
