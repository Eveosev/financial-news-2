Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) 
shareholders will receive preliminary bids until July 8 for
their controlling stake in the world’s second-largest maker of
computer-memory chips,  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  said.  Nine financial institutions led by Korea Exchange Bank will
pick a preferred bidder in August, the bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. Bidders will be asked to buy all or part of the
shareholders’ 15 percent stake as well as new shares, according
to the statement.  The shareholders gained the stake by converting debt into
shares through a government-initiated bailout of the chipmaker
in 2001. The shares are worth about 2.24 trillion won ($2.1
billion) based on yesterday’s closing price.  Three previous efforts since 2009 to sell the stake failed
because buyers could not be found.  Hynix fell 0.4 percent to 25,100 won as of 11:49 a.m. in
Seoul trading, giving the company a market value of 14.8
trillion won. The stock has gained 4.4 percent this year,
compared with the benchmark Kospi index’s 1.5 percent decline.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the world’s biggest shipyard,
said June 8 it is looking “with interest” at buying the Hynix
stake.  Credit Suisse Group AG,  Korea Development Bank , NH-CA
Investment & Securities Co., Shinhan Investment Corp. and Woori
Investment & Securities Co. are to arrange the sale, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
