Stora Enso Oyj (STEAV) ,  Europe ’s biggest
papermaker, plans to close the Kopparfors sawmill and pellet
mill in Sweden by the end of the year following negotiations
with unions.  Kopparfors is unprofitable, “with no significant prospect
of improvement,” the Helsinki-based company said today in a
statement, reiterating a preliminary decision announced March
22. The Swedish site has 110 employees. Stora Enso is looking
for a buyer of the location and has “already had some
contacts,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
