Sudan  will shut export pipelines for
oil pumped in  Southern Sudan  if the landlocked south doesn’t pay
usage fees or share proceeds following its independence from the
north next month, President Umar al-Bashir said.  Southern Sudan will assume control of about 75 percent of
Sudan’s current oil production of 490,000 barrels a day when it
is declared independent on July 9. Under the 2005  peace
agreement , which ended the two-decade civil war between the
north and the south, the two sides share proceeds from oil
pumped in the south on a 50-50 basis.  “Either we continue the split, or we take our right from
any oil that passes through our land here,” al-Bashir said in a
speech given in the northeastern  Red Sea  state and broadcast
live on state-owned Sudan TV. “If you don’t want either of the
two options, we will shut the pipeline.”  Delegations from the two sides agreed last month that the
south will pay the north fees for the use of pipelines and
facilities at  Port Sudan  on the Red Sea to export the crude,
Lual Deng, a member of the south’s ruling Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement and the oil minister in Sudan’s national
unity government, said on June 16.  The two sides are discussing the cost of the fees, which
must be “reasonable” or the south would look for other ways to
export its oil, Deng said.  Sudan’s crude is pumped mainly by China National Petroleum
Corp., Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd and India’s Oil &
Natural Gas Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
