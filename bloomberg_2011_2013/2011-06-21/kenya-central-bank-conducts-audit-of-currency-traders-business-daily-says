Kenya ’s central bank carried out an
audit of commercial banks’ foreign-exchange-dealing books on
June 16 in an attempt to identify suspected currency
speculators, Business Daily reported.  The action was taken on the day the currency fell to a
record low of 90.60 against the dollar, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing Samir Lagadia, a senior trader at  Diamond
Trust of Kenya Ltd. (DTKL)  It’s the second time the Central Bank of
Kenya has audited banks’ dealing activities, the newspaper said.  In March, Governor Njuguna Ndung’u warned that the bank
would withdraw licenses where there was evidence of irregular
trading, the newspaper said. The central bank didn’t respond to
requests for comment, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
