China ’s aluminum consumption will
probably grow at the same rate as the country’s economy, said
Lilian Luca, a managing director at Beijing Axis, a commodity
adviser.  China’s gross domestic product may grow at an average 8
percent to 9 percent for the next 10 to 15 years, Luca, who is
based in Beijing, said in an interview today at an industry
conference in  Chicago .  Global aluminum prices probably will rise gradually, without
a “dramatic surge,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
