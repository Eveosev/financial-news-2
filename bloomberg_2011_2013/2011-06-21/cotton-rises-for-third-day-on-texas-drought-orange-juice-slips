Cotton climbed for the third
straight session on signs drought conditions will worsen in
 Texas , the biggest U.S. producing state.  Orange juice  fell.  Texas is not expected to receive any significant rainfall
for at least two more weeks, according to AccuWeather Inc. The
October-through-May period was the state’s driest since record-
keeping began in 1895, according to Texas State Climatologist
John Nielsen-Gammon. The U.S. is the world’s biggest cotton
shipper.  “There’s no real forecast for any type of weather that’s
going to make the cotton areas, especially the Texas areas, get
any better,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price
Futures Group Inc. in Chicago.  Cotton for December delivery climbed 1.42 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $1.2549 a pound at 10:07 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . Before today, the price tumbled 44 percent since
reaching a record $2.197 on March 7 on signs of slowing demand
in China, the largest consumer.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery declined 0.55
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $1.8215 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
