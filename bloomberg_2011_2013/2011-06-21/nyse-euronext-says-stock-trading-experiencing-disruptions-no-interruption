NYSE Euronext (NYX)  said it’s working to
fix a technical problem in one of the units of the equity and
bond markets it operates, which has caused disruptions in the
Netherlands and  Belgium .  “We are experiencing a technical incident and we are
working to resolve it,” said Caroline Tourrier, a spokeswoman
for Euronext in Paris. She said the issue affected “only a
subset” of equities.  Euronext halted the “trading unit 2,” causing “partial
degradation” of trading, according to the exchange’s website.
The Netherlands’ AEX Index and Belgium’s  BEL 20 Index (BEL20)  were “not
broadcasting” while traders were unable to enter or cancel
orders for some products, the site said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
