Major League Baseball Commissioner
 Bud Selig  acted without a “good faith basis” in rejecting the
 Los Angeles Dodgers ’ proposed television deal with  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s
Fox Sports, a lawyer for team owner  Frank McCourt  said.  McCourt is “trying to sit down” with Selig and remains
hopeful an agreement can be reached on the Fox proposal or a
similar deal, Robert Sacks, McCourt’s lawyer, said today in an
interview with Bloomberg Television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
