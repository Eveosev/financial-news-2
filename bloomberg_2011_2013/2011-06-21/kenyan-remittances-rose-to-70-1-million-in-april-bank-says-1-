Money sent home from Kenyans living
abroad increased 33 percent to $70.1 million in April from the
year earlier as the economic recovery continued in  Europe  and
 North America , the central bank said.  Remittances to the East African nation surged to $266.5
million in the first four months of the year, compared with
$196.5 million in the year-earlier period, the Nairobi-based
Central Bank of Kenya said in a statement on its website today.  Kenya relied on North America for 56 percent of its
remittances in April and Europe for 26 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
