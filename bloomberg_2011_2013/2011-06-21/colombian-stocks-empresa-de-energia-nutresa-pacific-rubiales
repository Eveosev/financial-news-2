The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 1 percent to 14,197.88, while the
Colcap Index added 0.7 percent to 1,709.27.  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB)  , Colombia’s
second-biggest electricity transporter, fell 1.7 percent to
160,000 pesos, a six-month low, after the company began the
process of splitting its stock 100-for-1, according to an e-
mailed statement yesterday.  Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA CB), Colombia’s biggest food
producer, rose 2.5 percent, the most in three weeks, to 23,580
pesos, after Celfin Capital raised the company’s year-end target
price by 1 percent to 29,400 pesos. Proceeds from the company’s
$295 million share sale “will be used to increase Nutresa’s
firepower for new acquisitions -- which, according to our
calculations, could be between $450 million and $550 million,”
Celfin said yesterday in an e-mailed report.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia , rose for a second
day by 3.5 percent to 49,100 pesos, the most in more than two
months, on bets the stock’s decline was overdone after the
company reported last month its first quarterly loss in a year,
said Santiago Melo, an analyst at brokerage Alianza Valores SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
