The U.S. boosted its import quota
for raw sugar in an attempt to ease a supply shortage amid
surging retail prices.  An additional 120,000 short tons was added to the tariff-
rate quota for the 2011 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the
Department of Agriculture said today in a  statement  on its
website. The quota now totals 1.676 million tons, the USDA said.  Sugar is the only major agricultural commodity produced in
the U.S. that is subject to import quotas. The limits were
established to benefit domestic growers. Mexico became exempt
from the quota in 2008 under the  North American Free Trade
Agreement .  To contact the reporters on this story:
