Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  advanced 65.82 points, or 1.8
percent, to 3,794.94, the steepest increase since Feb. 18.  PT Bakrie & Brothers (BNBR IJ), an Indonesian  investment
company , jumped 6.2 percent to 69 rupiah, the most since May 10.
The stock rebounded amid speculation its 18 percent, two-week
plunge was excessive, according to Ryan Ariadi Suwarno, an
analyst at PT Kiwoom Securities  Indonesia . The stock’s 14-day
relative-strength index, which measures how rapidly prices have
risen or dropped during a specified period, dropped to 29
yesterday. A reading of below 30 suggests to some analysts that
a stock is poised to gain.  PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional (BTPN IJ), which
specializes in pension loans, rose 1.7 percent to 3,000 rupiah,
the sharpest increase since May 27. The company will sell two
series of fixed-rate bonds for a total of 500 billion rupiah
($58 million) on June 22 and June 23, it said in a statement
published in  Bisnis Indonesia  today.  PT Medco Energi Internasional (MEDC IJ), Indonesia’s
biggest listed oil producer, rose 2.3 percent to 2,275 rupiah,
the largest gain since Feb. 17. Medco said it’s in talks with
Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Indonesian unit to supply gas from its
Block-A natural-gas project to Exxon’s Arun liquefied natural-
gas plant in Aceh province.  PT Metro Realty (MTSM IJ), a supermarket operator, jumped
23 percent to 1,850 rupiah, the highest close since Jan. 12,
1995. The company’s shareholders approved a plan for a four-for-
one stock split, Metro Realty said in a statement to the
Indonesia Stock Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
