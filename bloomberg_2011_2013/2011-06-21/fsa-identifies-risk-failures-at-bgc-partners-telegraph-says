The Financial Services Authority
imposed restrictions on  BGC Partners Inc. (BGCP) , an inter-dealer
broker, after identifying problems in its risk, compliance and
governance procedures, The  Daily Telegraph  reported.  The U.K. regulator found weaknesses relating to controls
against money laundering, bribery, corruption and fraud
prevention controls, the paper reported, without saying how it
got the information.  BGC agreed not to launch any new business lines in the U.K.
or make any acquisitions for at least six months. Shareholders
have been informed that the regulator may impose additional
requirements, according to the Telegraph.  FSA spokeswoman Clare Duffy and BGC spokeswoman Deborah
Spencer declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story: Kit Chellel in London
