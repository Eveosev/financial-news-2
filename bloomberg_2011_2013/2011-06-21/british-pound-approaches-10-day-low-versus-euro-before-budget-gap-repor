The pound neared the weakest level
in more than a week against the euro before data forecast to
show the U.K. budget gap widened in May.  Net borrowing rose to 16.5 billion pounds ($27.6 billion)
from 7.7 billion pounds in April, according to the median
estimate of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The U.K.
plans to auction 4.75 billion pounds of 2 percent notes maturing
in January 2016 today.  The pound depreciated 0.2 percent to 88.50 pence per euro
as of 7:34 a.m. in  London . It reached 88.55 pence on June 17,
the weakest since June 10. Sterling climbed 0.2 percent to
$1.6234 and was little changed at 130.14 yen.  Stocks gained, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index adding 1.3
percent, the most since May 31. Futures on the FTSE 100 Index of
U.K. shares gained 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
