Aquila Resources Ltd. (AQA) , an Australian
coal producer, missed two further shipments from its mine in
Queensland state as talks with joint venture partner  Vale SA (VALE) 
over shipping remain deadlocked.  The company doesn’t anticipate any shipments before the end
of the quarter, Perth-based Aquila said today in a filing. Sales
for the quarter will be 141,740 metric tons, it said.  Vale  and Aquila haven’t been able to agree on shipping
schedules after a previous arrangement ended in November under
which Vale marketed coal from Isaac Plains. A customer canceled
a shipment earlier this month, Aquila has said.  “Isaac Plains currently continues to produce coal and coal
stocks at Isaac Plains are building up,” Aquila said. “It is
now likely that stockpile limits will be reached in early
July.”  Aquila rose 2.2 percent to A$7.51 at 10:24 a.m. Sydney time
on the Australian stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
