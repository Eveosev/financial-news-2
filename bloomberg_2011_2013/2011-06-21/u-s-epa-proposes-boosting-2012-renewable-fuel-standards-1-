The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency proposed increasing the amount of renewable fuels used in
U.S. vehicles next year.  The volume of renewable fuels such as biomass-based diesel
and advanced biofuels should increase to 15.2 billion gallons in
2012 from 13.95 billion gallons this year, the agency said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Under a 2007 federal law, the U.S. intends to reach 36
billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022.  To contact the reporters on this story: Angela Greiling Keane in
