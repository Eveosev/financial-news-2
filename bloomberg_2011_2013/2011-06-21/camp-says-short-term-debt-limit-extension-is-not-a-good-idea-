House Ways and Means Chairman  Dave Camp  said a short-term increase in the U.S. debt ceiling
wouldn’t be his choice.  “I think that’s not a good idea because it doesn’t give
you the certainty,” the Michigan Republican said today in
 Washington  at a meeting of corporate chief financial officers
sponsored by the Wall Street Journal.  Camp said an agreement to raise the debt limit may not
include all of the details that would show how a savings of more
than $2 trillion would be achieved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
