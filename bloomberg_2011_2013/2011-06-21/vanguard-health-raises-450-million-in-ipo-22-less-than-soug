Vanguard Health Systems Inc., the
hospital operator controlled by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , gained 5
cents on its first day of  stock trading  after the company raised
$450 million in an initial public offering.  Vanguard Health climbed to $18.05 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The Nashville, Tennessee-based
company sold 25 million shares at $18 each yesterday, according
to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, after
offering them for $21 to $23. Vanguard Health is trading under
the symbol VHS.  The hospital operator cut its offering to attract buyers as
the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index has fallen 3.7 percent this
month amid concern the U.S. economic recovery is stalling.
Pandora Media Inc., the streaming radio company, dropped 17
percent since its IPO June 14 and LinkedIn Corp., the networking
website, is down 30 percent from its post-IPO high last month.  Vanguard Health owns and operates 26 hospitals in five
states, as well as two surgery centers in  California  and three
health insurance plans, according to the filing. It had $3.39
billion in revenue for the nine months ended March 31. Funds led
by New York-based Blackstone agreed to buy the company in 2004
for $1.75 billion, according to a company statement at the time.  Blackstone owned about two-thirds of the company before the
offering. After the IPO, current investors will still hold a
majority of the  voting rights , Vanguard said in the filing.  Proceeds will be used to pay down debt, according to the
IPO prospectus. Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup
Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the
deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
