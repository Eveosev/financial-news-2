Zimbabwe’s Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai  said military, police and intelligence officials
should quit their positions and enter politics as civilians, the
 Daily News  reported.  The prime minister, who heads the Movement for Democratic
Change, said security officials should end their often violent
support for President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front and enter politics in their own right, the
Harare-based Daily News said on its website. Tsvangirai said
that state-sponsored violence against civilians was treasonous,
the Daily News said.  The newspaper quoted Tsvangirai as saying Mugabe, 87, was
old and “needs help.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
