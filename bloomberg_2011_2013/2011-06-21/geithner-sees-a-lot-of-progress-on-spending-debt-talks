U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said today he sees “a lot of progress” in bipartisan
spending and deficit talks that have been taking place in
 Washington .  Geithner, speaking at an event in Washington, said that the
government’s Aug. 2 limit for borrowing is “imposed by
reality” unless there is Congressional action to raise the debt
ceiling.  “We are making a lot of progress” on a plan to cut the
deficit and raise the government’s borrowing limit, Geithner
said. “We’re getting closer.”  Vice President Joe Biden’s bi-partisan deficit-reduction
group has been holding meetings since May 5 to reach a
compromise that would clear the way for a vote in Congress to
raise the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. Republicans are
demanding trillions of dollars in budget savings, while
Democrats are resisting any changes to Medicare, the long-term
driver of the debt.  Geithner expressed confidence in raising the debt limit,
saying that the alternative, a possible U.S. government default,
is unthinkable.  The Treasury secretary said that a strong  U.S. dollar 
“will always be in the interest of the U.S,” while encouraging
a “more unified” voice from  Europe  as it seeks to resolve its
debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
