Credit-default swaps on  Allied Irish
Banks Plc (ALBK)  will be settled at auctions after the International
Swaps & Derivatives Association  ruled  there has been a failure-
to-pay  credit event .  Allied Irish caused the event when it skipped payments on
subordinated bonds this month. This trumps ISDA’s ruling last
week that a restructuring event had occurred when the Dublin-
based lender changed terms on subordinated bonds, wiping out
investors who refused to accept as much as a 90 percent
discount.  Restructuring events are more difficult to settle because
they involve multiple bond auctions, while under a failure-to-
pay method two auctions will be held for senior and subordinated
debt. Investors bought and sold 1,621 swaps insuring a net $502
million of  Allied Irish  debt as of June 10, according to the
 Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.   “This is what the market was hoping for,” said  Hank Calenti , a bank strategist at Societe Generale SA in London.
“It certainly provides more clarity and will probably help with
easier settlement.”  Catherine Burke , a spokeswoman for Allied Irish wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  Allied Irish’s 1.5 billion euros ($2.2 billion) of senior
unsecured floating-rate notes due September 2011 rose 0.75 cent
today to 95.75 cents on the euro, the highest since June 17,
according to Jefferies International Ltd. prices. Its 750
million euros of 5.625 percent bonds maturing in November 2014
climbed 0.5 cent to 70.5 cents on the euro, the first increase
since May 6, Jefferies prices show.  Subordinated Bonds  The lender’s 868.5 million euros of 12.5 percent
subordinated bonds maturing in June 2019 have been unchanged at
24.5 cents on the euro since May 31, according to Jefferies
prices.  The lender is the second Irish institution to default after
 Anglo Irish Bank Corp . triggered both restructuring and failure-
to-pay credit events last year.  Default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a company
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
