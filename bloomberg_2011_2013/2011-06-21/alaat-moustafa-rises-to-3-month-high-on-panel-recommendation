Talaat Moustafa Group (TMGH)  Holding headed
for the highest close in almost three months after an advisory
panel of judges recommended the company keep the land it
purchased from the government for its Madinaty project.  The shares of  Egypt ’s biggest publicly traded real-estate
developer jumped as much as 4.2 percent. They gained 1.2 percent
to 5.1 Egyptian pounds at 12:14 p.m. in Cairo, headed for the
highest close since March 24. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
advanced less than 0.1 percent.  Judge Hassan Abdel Aziz said the court needed time to study
the report by the advisory panel. The judge delayed a ruling
until Oct. 4 on the case filed to strip Talaat Moustafa of a
land plot on the outskirts of Cairo because it wasn’t purchased
from the government at a public auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
