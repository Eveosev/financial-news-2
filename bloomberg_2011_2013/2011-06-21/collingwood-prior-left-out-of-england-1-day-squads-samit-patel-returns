Former captain  Paul Collingwood  and
wicketkeeper Matt Prior were left out of the England cricket
squads for forthcoming limited-overs matches against Sri Lanka.  Wicketkeeper  Craig Kieswetter  and all-rounder Samit Patel
were recalled for both a Twenty20 match in Bristol in four days
and the five-match one-day series, which starts June 28.
Collingwood and Prior were both in England’s World Cup squad
earlier this year.  Collingwood, 35, retired from Test cricket in January
following the Ashes to concentrate on the shorter forms of the
game. He captained England to the World Twenty20 title last year
and recently returned to his county club Durham after a knee
injury.  England national selector Geoff Miller said the all-
rounder’s omission was “purely down to form.”  “He has always brought a great deal to the England team
and we know he’ll be working as hard as ever to reach peak form
and fitness with an England recall firmly in the forefront of
his mind,” Miller said in a  statement .  Patel, who hasn’t played a one-day international since
November 2008, returns to the squad after his exclusion for
being overweight.  “Samit Patel has taken significant steps in the right
direction and he has more hard work ahead in order to make
further progress,” Miller said.  Stuart Broad  will debut as Twenty20 captain, while Alastair Cook will lead the one-day squad for the first time. Both were
named to the posts last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
