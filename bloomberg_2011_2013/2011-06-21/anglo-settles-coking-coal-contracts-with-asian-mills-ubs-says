Asian steelmakers agreed to pay
 Anglo American Plc (AAL)  $315 a metric ton for hard coking coal in the
September quarter after first rejecting the offer as too high,
according to UBS AG.  “This sudden deal reflects new concern over supply,” UBS
analysts led by Sydney-based Tom Price said in a note yesterday,
citing  strike action  at mines operated by BHP Billiton
Mitsubishi Alliance. UBS didn’t say where it got the
information. Jacqui Strambi, a spokeswoman for Anglo, didn’t
immediately return a voicemail left at her office.  Steelmaking-coal prices rose 47 percent to a record $330 a
ton for three-month contracts starting April 1 after heavy rain
and flooding in  Australia  shut mines and curbed output from the
world’s biggest exporter of the commodity. Rio Tinto Group,
Xstrata Plc and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  were among companies that
notified customers they would miss deliveries after the floods.  Stoppages at BHP’s mines in Queensland took place across
three days, commencing at the Saraji and Norwich Park mines on
June 14, then the Gregory, Crinum and Blackwater mines on June
15 and the Goonyella Riverside and Peak Downs mines June 18.  Australia is the biggest shipper of coking coal and the
second-largest exporter of thermal coal for power stations,
after Indonesia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
