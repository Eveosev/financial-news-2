Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  and European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. should cooperate to build drones
for the French and British militaries, French Defense Minister
Gerard Longuet said.  France  will need to buy non-French drones to fill a gap
until 2016, the earliest that Dassault and EADS’s drone could be
available, he said.  “It would be absurd for the state in its role as
shareholder not to tell companies it has stakes in to work
together,” he said at the Bourget Air Show. “The French
British MALE accord will result in one drone; they will have to
learn to work together,” he said, referring to Medium Altitude
Long Endurance drones.  France and Britain pledged in the so-called Lancaster House
agreement last November to jointly develop the next generation
of drones to end their dependence on U.S. and Israeli unmanned
aircraft. Drones have taken on an increasingly important role in
reconnaissance and even ground attacks in conflicts such as
 Afghanistan .  Dassault is working with  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  on their Telemos
drone, while EADS is developing its Talarion vehicle.
Longuet wouldn’t say what drones he will buy to fill the gap.  “If I told you I want to buy Reapers, they’d just raise
their prices,” he said, referring the unmanned military
vehicles made by General Atomics.  “We can’t accept holes and we won’t sacrifice the security
of our soldiers,” he said. “The choice is not binary or
national. I’ll look for a synthesis between our need for
capacity and supporting our national industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
