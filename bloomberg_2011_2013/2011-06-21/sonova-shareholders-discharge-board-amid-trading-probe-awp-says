Sonova Holding AG (SOON)  shareholders

their duties for the business year that ended in March during
Sonova’s annual general meeting, AWP reported.  The Zurich prosecutor’s office is probing a possible
insider trading case in which Rihs, former Chief Executive
Officer Valentin Chapero and ex-finance chief Oliver Walker are
under investigation, the company said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
