Freeport LNGâ€™s liquefied-natural-gas
terminal in Freeport,  Texas , is to receive an LNG tanker July 5,
according to vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  The tanker, Grace Cosmos, can carry 146,794 cubic meters of
LNG, or about 3.16 billion cubic feet when converted to a gas.  LNG is gas that is cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back to a gaseous form.  To contact the reporter on this story:
