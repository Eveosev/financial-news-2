Energy Development Corp. (EDC)  climbed the
most this month in Manila trading after the power producer
obtained a $175 million loan to refinance existing debt and said
it may recover the 1.8 billion-peso annual revenue loss caused
by the rehabilitation of a facility.  Energy Development rose 1.9 percent to 6.52 pesos at the
noon local-time close, the sharpest advance since May 31. The
benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index increased 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
