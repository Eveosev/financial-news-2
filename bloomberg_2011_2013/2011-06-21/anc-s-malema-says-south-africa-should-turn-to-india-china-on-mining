South Africa  is likely to attract
investment into its  mining industry  from India and  China  if it
goes ahead with a policy of nationalizing mines proposed by the
youth wing of the ruling  African National Congress ,  Julius
Malema , the leader of the organization, said.  Malema has advocated the nationalization of South African
mines, banks and land to spread the wealth of the country to the
black majority.  Malema spoke in an interview with Johannesburgâ€™s Metro FM
radio station today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
