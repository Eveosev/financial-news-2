     June 21 (Bloomberg) --South African stocks advanced the
most in almost a month, led by mining companies  Anglo American
Plc (AGL)  and  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL) , as easing concern that  Greece  will
default buoyed metals prices.  The FTSE/JSE All Share Index climbed 1.1 percent to
30,971.88 by the 5 p.m. end of trading in Johannesburg, the
biggest one-day jump since May 27.  Copper rebounded from a three-week low while lead, nickel,
and zinc also advanced after Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker indicated a solution to the crisis would be
found. Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  faces a confidence
vote today that may determine whether Greece becomes the first
euro-area country to default.  Anglo American, the diversified mining company that makes
up almost 10 percent of  South Africa ’s benchmark stock index,
climbed the most since February, jumping 3 percent to 318 rand.
 BHP Billiton , the world’s largest mining company, snapped three
days of losses, rising 2.4 percent to 252.90 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
