What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 12 cents to 15 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade as the U.S.  forecast  that
above-average temperatures may move north from the southern
Great Plains into the Midwest by the middle of next week,
eroding crop prospects, said Gregg Hunt, a broker at Archer
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 13 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that high Midwest temperatures may
damage crops, Hunt said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open 0.4 cent to 0.5 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal
futures may open up $2 to $3 for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that a Canadian government report
on June 23 will show flooding and excessive rains in the past
month reduced planting, Hunt said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
