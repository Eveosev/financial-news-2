Australia , the world’s largest
shipper of coal, iron ore and wool, raised its forecast for
export earnings 2 percent to a record for the next fiscal year,
driven by expectations of higher production and export prices.  Sales may total A$256.3 billion ($272 billion) in the 12
months to June 30, 2012, the Canberra-based  Australian Bureau  of
Agricultural & Resource Economics & Sciences said in a report
today. That compares to its March forecast of A$251.3 billion
and a revised prediction for the current year of A$217.8 billion.  Rising incomes and economic growth in emerging markets
including China and  India  are fueling demand for energy, metals
and farm products, helping drive prices higher. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials has rallied 5.6 percent
this year as commodities from silver to corn advanced.  “Forecast increases in export prices and shipments for
Australian  iron ore  and metallurgical coal are the main reasons
for the expected increase in mineral resources exports,” Kim
Ritman, acting deputy executive director at the bureau, said in
a statement. Higher production and prices will boost farm
exports, offsetting the stronger Australian dollar, he said.  Earnings from energy and mineral exports are expected to
reach A$218.3 billion, compared with a March forecast of A$214.6
billion and A$182 billion a year earlier, the agency said.  The value of Australia’s farm exports is forecast at A$34.1
billion next fiscal year, up from A$32.5 billion in the March
outlook and compared with A$32 billion this fiscal year,
according to the report.  The bureau raised its Australian dollar forecast to $1.01
from 97 cents in its March outlook. The local currency has
gained 3.6 percent this year and touched $1.1012 on May 2, the
strongest since it was freely floated in 1983, as surging demand
from China and India boosted sales of the nation’s commodities.  Australia’s economy will recover faster than anticipated
from last quarter’s contraction driven by a record mining boom,
Finance Minister  Penny Wong  said June 17. The economy will be
underpinned by a A$430 billion pipeline of investment in
minerals and energy, she said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
