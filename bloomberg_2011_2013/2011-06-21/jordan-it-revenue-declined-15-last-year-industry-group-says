Jordan’s  information technology 
revenue dropped by 15 percent to $732 million last year compared
with 2009 because of a cut in government spending in the
industry, the  Information Technology Association of Jordan  said.  “In 2010, the government’s spending on information
technology was about 25 million dinars ($35 million), while in
2009 and the years before it was about 150 million dinars on
average annually,” Abed Shamlawi, Chief Executive Officer of
the industry body, said in a phone interview in Amman today.  The kingdom’s top clients were in  Saudi Arabia , with 34
percent, followed by Iraq and the  United Arab Emirates  with 13
percent and the U.S. with 7 percent, he said.  Foreign direct investments in the information technology
industry increased by $15 million last year to $143 million
compared with 2009, according to the association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
