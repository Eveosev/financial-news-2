Ormat Industries (ORMT)  Ltd. climbed the
most in almost two weeks after  Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) , the U.S.
subsidiary of the developer of geothermal power plants, was
awarded a project to build a plant in New Zealand.  Ormat Industries shares increased 5.6 percent, the biggest
gain since June 9, to 21.77 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in
Tel Aviv.  A unit of Ormat Technologies entered a so-called BOT, or
build, operate and transfer, agreement with Tikitere Geothermal
Power Ltd. for a 45 megawatt geothermal power project, Ormat
Technologies said today in a statement distributed by PR
Newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
