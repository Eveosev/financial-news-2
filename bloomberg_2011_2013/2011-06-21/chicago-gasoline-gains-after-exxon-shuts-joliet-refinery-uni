Chicago  gasoline strengthened after
Exxon Mobil Corp. shut a furnace for repairs at the Joliet,
Illinois, refinery.  The 238,000-barrel-a-day plant flared hydrogen sulfide and
sulfur dioxide, causing the shutdown of the furnace for repairs,
the company said in a filing with the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency.  The discount for 87-octane, conventional gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 2 cents to 13.5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:34 p.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
slipped 0.65 cent to $2.75 a gallon.  BP Plc’s 475,000-barrel-a-day Texas City, Texas, refinery
will operate at reduced rates until August because of problems
associated with an April power failure that caused the plant to
shut,  Scott Dean , a BP spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  narrowed 1.75 cents to 19.5 cents a gallon.  On average over the second quarter, BP’s Texas City
refinery has used about half the plant’s capacity, Dean said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
