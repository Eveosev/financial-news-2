BP Plc (BP/)  said it will resume drilling
on the Central Azeri platform once scheduled maintenance is
completed this month.  “We have temporarily stopped drilling activities on the
Central Azeri platform due to the planned rig maintenance,”
Tamam Bayatly, a BP spokeswoman in Azerbaijan, said in an e-
mailed statement late yesterday.  Central Azeri produced an average 216,000 barrels a day in
the first quarter, she said. “This is slightly lower than what
was expected because of certain planned activities that we
undertook as part of normal operations,” according to Bayatly.  Azeri oil output has fallen this year because a 2008 gas
leak kept the BP-led venture from drilling at a Caspian Sea
field, ANS television said on June 19, citing Rovnaq Abdullayev,
head of the State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
