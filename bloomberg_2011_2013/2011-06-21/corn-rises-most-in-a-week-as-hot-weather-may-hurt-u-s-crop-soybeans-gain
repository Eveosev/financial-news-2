Corn advanced the most since June 8
and soybeans had their biggest gain in more than two weeks on
speculation that hot U.S. weather will move into the main
growing regions next week, limiting crop prospects.  Temperatures as much as 12 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in the southern Great Plains may move into parts of the Midwest
beginning June 30, said Dave Tolleris, the president of
WXRisk.com in Richmond, Virginia. The hot, dry weather will
approach the Canadian border and may cause stress for crops that
had too much rain in the past month, Tolleris said.  “The markets fear a possible shift in the weather pattern
that may damage crops,” said Gregg Hunt, a broker at Archer
Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago . “There are enough questions
about the weather forecast” to spur traders to reduce bets on
lower prices, Hunt said.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 19.75 cents, or 3
percent, to close at $6.8025 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the third straight gain. On June 17, the
price touched $6.4775, the lowest since March 17.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 14.25 cents, or
1.1 percent, to close at $13.4975 a bushel on the CBOT, capping
the first two-day gain for the most-active contract since June
3. Yesterday, the price touched $13.30, the lowest since May 17.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, valued at $66.7
billion in 2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion,
government figures show. The nation is the world’s top exporter
of the grain and oilseed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
