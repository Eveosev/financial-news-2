The U.S. Treasury Department imposed
sanctions against three Libyan banks and lifted sanctions
against a former Libyan government official who defected.  “The Treasury Department is carefully monitoring Libyan-
associated entities worldwide to ensure that they are not
attempting to evade sanctions and assist the Qaddafi regime,”
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control Director Adam Szubin
said in a release. “We will remain vigilant in our efforts to
isolate the Qaddafi regime from the international financial
system.”  The Treasury blocked licenses from three Libyan-owned banks
and identified nine Libyan owned- or controlled companies
subject to sanctions. OFAC, as the office is known, removed
sanctions against  Libya ’s former oil minister and former
chairman of the National Oil Corporation of Libya, Shokri
Muhammed Ghanem, who defected from the Qaddafi regime last
month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
