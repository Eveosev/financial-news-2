Investors are increasing bets the
central bank will keep the benchmark interest rate at a record
low this week on speculation that inflation will slow.  Three-month forward-rate agreements fell five basis points
to 9 percent, the first decline since June 10, at 2:50 p.m. in
Istanbul. Six-month cross-currency swaps dropped three basis
points to 7.1196 percent, the biggest decline since May 24.  Policy makers will probably leave their benchmark rate at
6.25 percent when they meet June 23, according to the median of
14 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Lower fruit prices will
probably help curb inflation after it accelerated to a six-month
high of 7.2 percent in May, the central bank said June 6.  “Food prices will surprise on the downside and central
bank will not hike rates on Thursday,” Isik Okte, a trader at
Finans Invest, said in e-mailed comments.  The two-year benchmark bond yield fell five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.03 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
