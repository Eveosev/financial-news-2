A failure by  Greece  to meet
conditions for release of the next tranche of an international
aid package would imply the country must declare a default,
Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said.  Greek authorities must approve fiscal measures and
privatization laws by the end of June to secure financing
needed beginning next month, Miklos said. The release of the
next installment of the 110 billion-euro ($158 billion)
package pledged by the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund  last year hinges on Greece’s ability to meet
these goals, he said.  “Full responsibility now lies with the Greek government
and parliament,” he said at a press conference in Bratislava
today. “If they don’t approve all that needs to be approved,
then there is nothing to talk about. Greece will have to
declare a default.”  More than a year after receiving the first bailout in the
euro region, concern about Greek public finances has risen and
the country remains dependent on external aid to avoid a
default. Prime Minister George Papandreou today faces a
confidence vote as he struggles to convince lawmakers to
accept austerity measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
