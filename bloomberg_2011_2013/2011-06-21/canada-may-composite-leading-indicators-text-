Following is the text of
 Canada 's leading indicators report from  Statistics Canada .  The composite leading index rose 1.0% in May after a
0.9% increase in April. The May increase equaled the
largest advance this year. In comparison, the composite
leading index rose 0.4% as recently as December 2010. In
May, 9 of the 10 components increased, 1 more than the
month before, while 1 declined. The manufacturing sector
showed the largest improvement from the previous month.  New orders for durable goods increased 9.8% in volume,
its largest advance since the recovery began. Much of the
hike in orders originated in aerospace. The ratio of
shipments to inventories posted a fourth straight advance,
as sales rose steadily while inventories leveled off after
three straight declines. The average workweek lengthened
for the fifth straight month.  The indicators related to household spending remained
mixed. The housing index continued to decline, down 0.6%,
as a dip in house sales outweighed a rebound in housing
starts. Furniture and appliance sales recorded their
largest gain in over a year, while spending on other
durable goods rebounded 0.2% after a drop the month
before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
