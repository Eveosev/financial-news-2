The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in

exporter, rose 3.5 percent to 1.17 pesos, the highest since
October 2008, after President  Juan Manuel Santos  said yesterday
he expects U.S. lawmakers to approve a free-trade agreement with
 Colombia  by August, according to a statement on the presidential
website.  Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA CB), Colombia’s biggest food
producer, rose 3.9 percent, the most since November on an
intraday basis, to 23,900 pesos, after Celfin Capital raised the
company’s year-end target price by 1 percent to 29,400 pesos.
Proceeds from the company’s $295 million share sale “will be
used to increase Nutresa’s firepower for new acquisitions --
which, according to our calculations, could be between $450
million and $550 million,” Celfin said in an e-mailed report.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, rose 2.6 percent
to 48,680 pesos, the most in almost a month on bets the stock’s
decline was overdone after the company reported last month its
first quarterly loss in a year, said Santiago Melo, an analyst
at brokerage Alianza Valores SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
