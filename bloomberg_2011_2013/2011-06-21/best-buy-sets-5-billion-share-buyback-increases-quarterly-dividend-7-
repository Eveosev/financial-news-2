Best Buy Co., the world’s largest
consumer electronics retailer, approved a new $5 billion share
repurchase plan and raised its quarterly dividend by 7 percent
after last quarter’s earnings exceeded analysts’ forecasts.  The buyback plan replaces the $5.5 billion program
announced in 2007, which had $800 million left as of May 28, the
Richfield, Minnesota-based company said today in a statement.
The payout will be increased to 16 cents a share.  Increasing demand for mobile phones and tablets countered
declining revenue from televisions in the quarter ended May 28.
As competition intensified from Amazon.com Inc. and Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., Chief Executive Officer Brian Dunn began
reorganizing stores and retraining employees last year to push
sales of gadgets that work together.  The stock jumped $1.19, or 3.8 percent, to $32.73 at 9:30
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Best Buy had
fallen 17 percent in the past 12 months through yesterday.  Profit has declined in the past three quarters as Best Buy
coped with competition from online sellers and discounters, and
consumers’ outlook on the economy darkened.  Bloomberg’s gauge of economic expectations fell this month
to the lowest level since March 2009 after unemployment hit a
2011 high of 9.1 percent in May.  Best Buy announced the measures as it prepares to host its
annual meeting at its headquarters today. The retailer last
raised its quarterly dividend, from 14 cents to 15 cents, in
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
