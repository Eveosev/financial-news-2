Ethanol futures rose a third day in
 Chicago  on speculation hot weather may move into the Midwest and
damage corn crops, raising production costs.  The biofuel also jumped on speculation that heat will hurt
crops in the Eastern corn belt, which were affected by a wet
spring that slowed planting. The U.S. Agriculture Department
reported that ethanol plants in the region are bidding as much
as $7.505 a bushel for corn, compared with the top bid in  Iowa 
of $7.105.  “There’s just a lot of front-end strength,” said Justin Dirico, senior ethanol trader at SCB & Associates LLC in
Chicago. “A big part of it is getting the corn to the East
Coast. That’s caused demand to grow for those gallons.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 6.1 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.727 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
steepest one-day gain since June 9. Futures have gained 15
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago jumped 8.5
cents, or 3.2 percent, to $2.725 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive increased 5.5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.81, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dirico predicted the spread between New York and Chicago
spot ethanol will widen as buyers in the East pay a premium amid
concern about the crop in the nearest corn-producing region.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf climbed 4 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $2.775 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive added 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.84.  Corn futures for December delivery increased 19.75 cents,
or 3 percent, to $6.8025 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes
at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa earning 4 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are pocketing 11 cents
on a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
