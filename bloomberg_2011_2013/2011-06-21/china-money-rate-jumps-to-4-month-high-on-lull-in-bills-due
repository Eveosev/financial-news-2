China ’s money-market rate climbed to
the highest level in more than four months on speculation a
decline in the amount of maturing central bank bills will extend
a cash shortage.  The People’s Bank of China didn’t offer any  repurchase
agreements  today, and sold 1 billion yuan ($155 million) of one-
year bills at a yield of 3.4019 percent, according to a
statement on its website. That compared with 3.3058 percent at
the auction last week and was the first time the rate had
increased in 11 weeks. Some 372 billion yuan of bills will
mature in July, compared with 601 billion yuan in June, said Liu Junyu, a Shenzhen-based bond analyst at China Merchants Bank Co.  “The cash shortage won’t ease until the end of this month
because only small amounts of bills mature this week and next,”
said Pang Aihua, a Beijing-based bond analyst at China Citic
Bank Co., a unit of China’s biggest state-investment company.
“The seven-day repo probably won’t drop below 6 percent this
week.”  The seven-day repurchase rate gained 83 basis points to
8.34 percent as of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to
a weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank
Funding Center. It touched 8.50 percent earlier, the highest
level since Jan. 31.  Some 88 billion yuan of central bank bills and repurchase
agreements will mature this week, compared with 115 billion yuan
the week before, Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong , said yesterday.  ‘Cautious Sentiment’  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose eight basis
points to 3.86 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “Cautious sentiment is dominating the market,” said Chen Qiwei, a senior bond trader at Shenzhen Development Bank Co. in
Shanghai. “There is still speculation an interest-rate hike may
come in the short term.”  The yield on the 2.77 percent government bond due May 2012
gained two basis points to 3.59 percent, the highest level since
the note began trading on May 12, according to the Interbank
Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Sandy Hendry  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
