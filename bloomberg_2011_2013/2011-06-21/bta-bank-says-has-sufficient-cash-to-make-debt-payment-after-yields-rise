BTA Bank,  Kazakhstan ’s biggest
lender before it defaulted two years ago, said it has enough
money to make a 24.3 billion tenge ($166 million) interest
payment on June 30 after yields on its debt soared.  BTA has 50.7 billion tenge in its accounts and can access
251 billion tenge through repurchase operations with the
National Bank of Kazakhstan, the Almaty-based lender said today
in an e-mailed statement.  “The bank has a sufficient level of short-term liquidity
allowing it to perform all of its obligations in full and in
accordance with the schedule and without any prejudice to the
current operational activities of the bank,” BTA said.  The yield on BTA’s dollar-denominated notes due in
2018 fell 42 basis points to 18.7 percent as of 7:27 p.m.
Almaty, after jumping 167 basis points to a record high
yesterday. BTA last year restructured $16.7 billion of debt
after the government took control of the bank when credit
markets froze and Kazakhstan’s property bubble burst.  In addition to the June 30 interest payment, BTA must repay
25.5 billion tenge of trade financing on Sept. 30, the bank said
today. BTA made the first 24.3 billion tenge coupon payment on
the 2018 notes in January and paid back 25.5 billion tenge of
trade financing in March, according to the statement.  The bank rejected on June 3 speculation that it may
restructure debts for a second time after overestimating the
potential recovery on bad loans.  “I totally exclude the question of BTA Bank restructuring
during this phase,” Chief Executive Officer Anvar Saidenov told
Bloomberg News on June 3. “We don’t even discuss this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
