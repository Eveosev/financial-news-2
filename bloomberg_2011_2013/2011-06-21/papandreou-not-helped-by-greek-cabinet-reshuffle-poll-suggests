Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s Cabinet shuffle last week hasn’t improved his Pasok
party’s standing among voters, according to an opinion poll for
private television channel Mega.  The number of people who said they would vote for Pasok
fell to 20.1 percent from 21.9 percent in a poll carried out
before the reshuffle, according to the results of the survey e-
mailed today by Athens-based Mega.  Support for the main opposition  New Democracy  party rose to
21 percent from 20.2 percent, while the number of voters who
said they would cast invalid ballots increased to 19.1 percent
from 17.4 percent, the poll showed.  In an effort to shore up political support from his own
party after two of his lawmakers quit parliament on June 17,
Papandreou replaced Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou 
with Evangelos Venizelos, who was defense minister.  While 60.7 percent of those questioned said Venizelos was a
positive choice for finance minister, 58 percent said he has
little room to change the government’s economic policy. More
than one in three voters said neither Papandreou nor New
Democracy leader Antonis Samaras was suitable to be prime
minister, while just over 55 percent of respondents said
Papandreou should not call early elections.  A total of 1,000 people were surveyed yesterday and today
for the poll, which had a 2.8 percentage-point margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
