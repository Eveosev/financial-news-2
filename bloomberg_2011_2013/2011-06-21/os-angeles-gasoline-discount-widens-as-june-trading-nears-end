Spot gasoline in the  San Francisco 
and  Los Angeles  spot markets strengthened as trading began for
July delivery.  The discount for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles narrowed 9.65 cents to 4 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 2:13
p.m. New York time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
fuel’s discount had widened the past two days as June-delivery
trading came to an end.  “Nothing blew up. It’s nothing crazy. We just rolled from
June to July,” said Randy Simpson, vice president of supply and
trading at Idemitsu Apollo Corp. in Sacramento, California.  The discount for the same fuel in San Francisco shrank for
the first time in six days, tightening 8.15 cents to 5.5 cents a
gallon.  Chevron Corp. shut a unit after an upset late yesterday at
its Richmond refinery in  California , according to regulators.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland , Oregon,
weakened 1.25 cents to a discount of 0.25 cent.  The premium for California-blend, low-sulfur diesel in Los
Angeles rose for the fifth consecutive day, gaining 0.25 cents
to 8.75 cents over heating oil futures on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
