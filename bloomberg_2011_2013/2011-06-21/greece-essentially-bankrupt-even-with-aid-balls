(Corrects Balls comment in headline and story, which was
published on June 21.)  Any attempts to solve Greece’s
sovereign crisis with a new bailout will be like “kicking the
can down the road,” said  Andrew Balls , Pacific Investment
Management Co.’s head of European  portfolio management .  Even if the nation is granted fresh aid, “these issues are
going to come up again in the next months,” Balls told Andrea Catherwood on Bloomberg Television today. It would be
“complacent if investors think this can be kicked down the road
until 2013,” he said.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  faces a confidence
vote today as he seeks to secure parliamentary support for
austerity measures required for the granting of outside aid to
prevent a default.  Balls said the only benefit of a Papandreou victory would
be to buy some time to prevent contagion spreading to other
economies, such as  Spain ’s.  “The concern we have is that if you continue to kick the
can down the road, you raise the risk of a disorderly default
and worse contagion impact,” he said. “If you just told the
truth and said Greece looks like it will need to restructure its
debt” you could then “try and have a supportive orderly
framework to do that.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
