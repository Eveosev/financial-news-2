The cost of insuring European
sovereign and corporate debt fell on speculation the Greek
government will pass a confidence vote tonight that will help it
avert an imminent default.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments dropped 9 basis points to 215 at
12:06 p.m. in London. Swaps on  Greece  dropped 119 basis points
to 1,883, according to CMA.  European Union leaders have insisted Greek Prime Minister
 George Papandreou  secure multi-party support for austerity
measures that are a condition of the aid needed to avoid
default. In an effort to shore up political support, Papandreou
on June 17 reshuffled his cabinet, replacing finance minister
 George Papaconstantinou  with Evangelos Venizelos, his defense
minister and one-time rival.  “A back room political carve up does not solve the long-
term issues facing Greece,” said  Bill Blain , co-head of
strategy at Newedge Group in London. “It just gives more time
to dig the hole a little deeper. Our considered advice - sell.”  Greek 10-year bond yields dropped seven basis points to
17.27 percent. They rose to a euro-era record 18.35 percent on
June 17. Two-year yields, which surpassed 30 percent for the
first time last week, fell for a third day, dropping 58 basis
points to 28.03 percent.  Irish Swaps  Default swaps on Ireland declined 26 basis points to 735,
 Portugal  fell 14 to 754 and  Spain  dropped 10 to 277, while Italy
narrowed 6.5 to 169.5 and Belgium was 5.5 lower at 146.5. A
decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 5
basis points to 406, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 2 basis points to 109.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 2 basis points to 159 and the
subordinated index declined 3.5 to 284.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
