Nigeria ,  Africa ’s largest oil
producer, plans to export 7.7 million barrels of Agbami
condensate, or light crude, in August, 1.3 percent less than
July, a loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Agbami’s shipping program comprises seven cargoes of
975,000 barrels, one of 500,000 barrels and one of 375,000.  The West African nation will also export one consignment of
700,000 barrels of Abo crude and three 950,000-barrels of Yoho
shipments, according to the plan.  Nigeria will export 12 cargoes of Qua Iboe, nine Bonny
Light, eight Forcados, six Bonga, five Erha, four Brass River,
three EA, two Okwori, one Okono and one Antan in August,
according to the programs released yesterday. Cargo sizes range
from 300,000 barrels to 1 million barrels.  Schedules of Akpo, Amenam, Escravos, Oso, and Pennnington
grades will be released in coming days.  The country plans to ship 77 cargoes totaling 70.2 million
barrels, or 2.27 million barrels a day, in July, according to
the schedules.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
