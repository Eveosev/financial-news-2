Refined-copper imports by  China 
tumbled to the lowest since level November 2008 as the biggest
user continued destocking, lowering local prices and making it
largely unprofitable to buy from overseas.  Inbound shipments dropped 47 percent from a year ago to
149,235 metric tons, down 6.9 percent from 160,236 tons in
April, according to Bloomberg News calculations based on data
provided by the General Administration of Customs. Exports
declined to 20,175 tons from a record 44,595 tons in April.  Chinese fabricators drained inventories in exchange and
bonded warehouses as a seasonal increase in demand from air-
conditioner makers and expansion of power grids was supplied by
higher domestic output. The usual summer lull, coupled with
tight credit conditions in the nation, may curb any rebound of
imports in the third quarter, analysts said.  “The London price is still too high for any restocking
plan,” said Zhao Kai, an analyst Jinrui Futures Co., a
subsidiary of China’s largest refined copper producer Jiangxi
Copper Co. “As the June-to-August period is the usual slack
season, we probably won’t see a strong rebound in imports,
despite the significant decline of domestic stocks,” he said.  Inventories Drop  Copper stockpiles monitored by the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange declined to a 21-month low of 82,309 tons on May 26.
They rose to 87,310 tons last week. Inventories at bonded
warehouses dropped to 300,000 tons to 350,000 tons from close to
600,000 tons two months ago, Zhao’s estimates show.  The metal for August delivery in Shanghai closed 1 percent
higher at 68,250 yuan ($10,557) a ton. Including a 17 percent
value-added tax in China, that’s $60 less than copper for
delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange, which
last traded at $9,072.25 a ton.  Output of semi-finished copper products in May jumped 20
percent from a year ago to 979,000 tons, and the production in
the first five months rose 15 percent on year to 4.11 million
tons, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.  Imports of refined copper may fall 32 percent this year to
2 million tons, said Li Yusheng, an analyst at metals researcher
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. The forecast was cut
from an estimate of 2.4 million tons made at the beginning of
this year, according to Li.  Weak Rebound  “We expect imports in the second half to rise from the
first half, but a jump doesn’t seem to be very likely,” Wu
Jianjian, an analyst at Yong’an Futures Co., said from Hangzhou.
“Because Beijing is determined to curb inflation, and as CPI
growth remains fast, there is no sign now that it’s going to
loosen  money supply  in the near future.”  China’s inflation rate climbed to 5.5 percent in May,
exceeding the government’s 4 percent target, even as the
People’s Bank of China has raised  interest rates  four times
since September, and reserve requirement ratio nine times to a
record of 21.5 percent for the biggest lenders.  The nation has missed its opportunity to stem inflation and
may now risk a hard landing, billionaire investor  George Soros 
said on June 14.  Monthly imports of unwrought copper, alloy and products may
not exceed 350,000 tons, Jinrui’s Zhao estimated. “Fabricators
may continue to use inventories in summer, if prices stay
elevated,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
