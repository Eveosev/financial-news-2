Germany  sees no other option than
having government-owned KfW Group buy  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s 15 percent
stake in European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co., Reuters
reported.  A search for a private bidder that could preserve the
balance in the French-German ownership structure has not
succeeded, the newswire reported, citing unidentified government
people.  Daimler Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche is pressing
the government to speed up the process, according to Reuters.
The discussions concerning a solution cannot continue forever,
Zetsche said, according to the newswire.  -- Editor: John Simpson  To contact the reporter on this story:
