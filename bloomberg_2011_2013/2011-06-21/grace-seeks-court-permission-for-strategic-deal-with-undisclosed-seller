W.R. Grace & Co., a bankrupt
specialty-chemical maker, asked a judge for permission to make
an acquisition from an undisclosed seller.  “The board determined in its business judgment that this
proposed transaction would significantly enhance Grace’s
business plan and growth strategy in coming years,” the company
said in papers filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Wilmington, Delaware.  Grace asked the court to seal documents related to the
proposed transaction. Its request “includes a range of highly
sensitive subjects that would cause the debtors great harm if it
were disclosed to seller and otherwise made public,” Grace said
in court papers.  Grace, based in Columbia,  Maryland , was among companies
that filed multibillion-dollar bankruptcies in 2000 and 2001 in
an attempt to limit their financial exposure to hundreds of
thousands of asbestos lawsuits. Asbestos particles can lodge
deep in the lungs, causing respiratory illnesses and cancer.  The central issue in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case was the
size of the asbestos liabilities faced by the 156-year-old maker
of chemicals and construction materials.  The bankruptcy case is In re W.R. Grace, 01-1139, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
