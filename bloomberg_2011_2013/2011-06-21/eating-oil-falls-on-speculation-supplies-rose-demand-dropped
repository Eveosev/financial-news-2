Heating oil futures sank to a four-
week low on speculation that U.S. heating oil and diesel
inventories rose last week and demand for  diesel fuel  declined.  Futures lost 1.4 percent as the Energy Department will
probably report that total stockpiles of distillate fuels rose
550,000 barrels last week to 141.4 million, according to the
median estimate of 17 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News.  “Most of the planting season is done and there is an
expectation of a build in supplies,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “And in their
desire to make gasoline, refiners are going to raise distillate
supplies by default.”  Heating oil for July delivery fell 4.2 cents to settle at
$2.89 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have
dropped 5.4 percent this month and 6.5 percent during the
quarter.  Heating oil was the worst performer, followed by gasoline,
on the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities.
The index advanced 0.6 percent as of 3:10 p.m. in  New York  as 16
of 19 commodities rose.  Demand for industrial, trucking and home-heating fuels sank
5.2 percent to 3.6 million barrels a day, a five-month low, in
the week ended June 10, according to department data.  The government is scheduled to report on last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington . Supplies of
gasoline probably rose a seventh straight week, gaining 1
million barrels, according to the survey.  Refinery Rates  Refinery rates rose 0.5 percent point to 86.6 percent,
according to the survey.  “The inventory report could be bearish for refined
products,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the
Energy Management Institute in New York.  Heating oil also declined as  Brent crude  on the ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange fell more than West Texas Intermediate oil on
Nymex. Refineries on the East Coast, where  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gasoline futures are delivered, primarily use oil from
Europe and West Africa, which are priced versus Brent.  The WTI-Brent spread, based on August futures, was $16.78 a
barrel, down from $18.06 yesterday.  The July heating oil crack spread on Nymex fell a second
straight day, losing $1.90 to $27.98 a barrel. The spread
reached $33.14 on June 13, the largest premium since May 2008.  Gasoline for July delivery fell 2.89 cents, or 1 percent,
to settle at $2.8826 a gallon on the exchange. Prices are down
8.5 percent this month and 7.2 percent this quarter.  Regular gasoline at the pump declined 0.9 cent to $3.637
yesterday, according to AAA data on its website. It’s the lowest
level since April 1. Prices are 33 percent above a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
