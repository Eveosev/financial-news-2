Gold may gain for a sixth day in New
York as a weaker dollar and concern about Europe’s debt crisis
spur demand for an alternative investment.  The dollar fell against six major currencies before a
report forecast to show U.S. home sales dropped in May to this
year’s low. Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  faces a
confidence vote in his government today that may determine
whether  Greece  becomes the first euro-area country to default.  “The softer dollar tone has lent some support to the
precious complex,”  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London, said today in a report. “Greece
looks set to be the focus of attention.”  Gold for August delivery rose $3.60, or 0.2 percent, to
$1,545.60 an ounce by 7:59 a.m. on the Comex in New York. A
sixth consecutive rise would be the best streak of gains since
April. Immediate-delivery gold was 0.3 percent higher at
$1,544.65 in London.  Bullion fell to $1,543 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in  London , used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,544 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  The  International Monetary Fund , contributor of a third of
the bailout money for Greece, Ireland and  Portugal , has warned
European leaders that a failure to take decisive action on the
debt crisis risks triggering “large global spillovers.” At the
same time, Papandreou is struggling to convince Greeks to accept
a 78 billion-euro ($112-billion) package of state-asset sales
and budget cuts, which include a “crisis levy” on wages.  Europe’s Debt Crisis  Gold is up 8.7 percent in 2011 after climbing the past 10
years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades in
London.  Europe ’s debt crisis helped bullion futures reach a
record $1,577.40 on May 2. The metal touched an all-time high
priced in British pounds yesterday and is trading 1.2 percent
from its peak in euros.  Gold is “holding near record highs as there is no quick
end in sight to economic turmoil in Europe,”  GoldCore Ltd. 
analysts in Dublin said in a report. “All fiat currencies are
now vulnerable to currency debasement and devaluation. Focusing
on gold solely in U.S. dollar terms remains simplistic and
misleading.”  Bullion may average $1,500 an ounce this year and $1,550 in
2012, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics and Sciences said in a report today. The metal has
averaged $1,445 so far in 2011.  “Uncertainty about the ability of many developed economies
to stimulate economic growth and control growing budget deficits
is expected to encourage investment demand for gold as a lower
risk, or safe haven, asset,” the Canberra-based agency said.  Silver for July delivery gained 0.5 percent to $36.255 an
ounce in  New York . Holdings of the metal in exchange-traded
products declined 13.6 metric tons to 13,551.9 tons yesterday,
the lowest level since September.  Palladium for September delivery rose 0.9 percent to $755
an ounce. Platinum for July delivery was 0.9 percent higher at
$1,746.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
