France ’s Parliament will vote next
month on whether to continue military operations in  Libya  in
accordance with the nation’s constitution.  The  National Assembly  will debate and vote on July 12 and
the  Senate , the upper chamber, will vote on an undetermined date
in the same month, press offices of both chambers said today in
Paris. Under  Article 35  of the constitution, parliament must
vote on continuing any military action that exceeds four months.  The mission has cost the country 100 million euros ($144
million) in unbudgeted operational expenses, Defense Minister
Gerard Longuet said today in a press conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
