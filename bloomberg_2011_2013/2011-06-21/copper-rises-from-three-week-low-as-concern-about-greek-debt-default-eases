Copper rebounded from a three-week
low as concern eased that  Greece  will default on its debt,
boosting the outlook for commodity demand.  The MSCI World Index of equities gained as much as 1.7
percent as renewed confidence in Greece buoyed the prospects for
global growth. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw
materials climbed for the second straight day.  “The economic numbers will start to improve” in the
second half, said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist
at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. Prices will “move higher as
equities make new highs for the year.”  Copper futures for September delivery advanced 1.45 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to close at $4.107 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . Yesterday, the price touched $4.024, the
lowest for a most-active contract since May 25.  The metal reached a record $4.6575 on Feb. 15 as the global
economic recovery lifted demand. Since then, the price has
dropped 12 percent as manufacturing slowed in  China , the world’s
largest consumer.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $75, or 0.8 percent, to $9,080 a metric ton
($4.12 a pound).  Zinc, tin, nickel, lead and aluminum also rose in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
