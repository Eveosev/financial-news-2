CEZ AS, the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, may sell its 50 percent stake in the Mibrag mine
in  Germany  because it’s worried about opposition among Germans
to coal-fired power plants,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing
an unidentified CEZ manager.  CEZ originally bought the Mibrag mine with the idea to
build a coal-fired power station on the site, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
