The  Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board  is seeking comment on proposed changes that may
require auditors of U.S.-registered firms to explain their
findings rather than simply saying whether rules were followed.  The PCAOB, the Washington-based watchdog for firms that
review companies’ books, issued a statement today on “possible
enhancements” of the model for the auditor’s report, which it
called a primary means for communicating with investors.  “The auditor is in a unique position to provide relevant
and useful information,” Martin F. Baumann, the PCAOB’s chief
auditor and director of professional standards, said in the
statement. “The concept release explores ways to expand the
auditor’s communication” about a report and a company’s
financial statements.  PCAOB Chairman James Doty said the release is a significant
move for investor protection in response to the 2008 financial
crisis and the first step toward reforms designed to improve the
relevance, transparency and reliability of the audit process.  The regulator, created by the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of 2002
and overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, will
accept comment on the concept release through Sept. 30 and plans
to hold a public meeting on the proposal later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
