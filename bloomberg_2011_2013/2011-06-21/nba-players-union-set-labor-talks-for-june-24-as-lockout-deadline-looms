The  National Basketball Association 
and its players’ union scheduled another round of contract talks
for June 24, less than a week before the deadline for a lockout.  The two sides met today in New York in what Commissioner
 David Stern  had described as a crucial session if progress was
to be made toward avoiding a work stoppage June 30.  Both Stern and  Billy Hunter , head of the players’ union,
said some progress was made today and another bargaining session
was warranted.  The owners are proposing a 10-year deal that guarantees the
players a minimum of $2 billion a year, the same as they get
now, and would eventually lead to a 50-50 split in revenue.
Players currently get 57 percent.  The owners also are proposing a flexible salary cap, not a
hard ceiling on payrolls.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
