Senegalese  anti-riot police broke up
an opposition rally in the capital, Dakar, yesterday, arresting
the leader of countryâ€™s National Movement of Young Socialists
party, Barthelemy Dias, Agence de Presse Senegalaise said.  An opposition coalition called Benno Siggil Senegal
organized the demonstration in response to a constitutional
amendment presented at the National Assembly, according to the
Dakar-based  news agency .  That amendment would allow incumbent President Abdoulaye Wade to win a third term in office with as little as 25 percent
of the vote in the first round of a presidential election
planned for Feb. 26. It would also see the creation of a vice
presidential position.  To contact the reporter on this story:
