Belgian regulators’ proposal forcing
cable operators including  Telenet Group Holding NV (TNET)  to open their
networks for rival offerings of broadband Internet and digital
television met with objections from the European Commission.  Belgian regulators need to take into account the emergence
of  Belgacom SA (BELG)  as a provider of digital TV services and
“justify better” the proposed obligation on cable operators to
share their networks with competitors given the declining
importance of analogue TV services, the European Commission in
Brussels said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
