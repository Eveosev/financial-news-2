National Bank of Kuwait (NBK)  SAK, the
country’s biggest lender, had its ratings lowered at Moody’s
Investors Services because of concerns about pressure on asset
quality and weaker credit conditions at home.  The bank’s standalone bank financial strength rating was
cut to C from C+, while the long-term global local currency and
long-term foreign currency deposit ratings were reduced to Aa3
from Aa2, Moody’s said in a report today.  “The action was driven by Moody’s expectations that in
2011, NBK will experience asset quality pressure arising from
its operations in countries experiencing political unrest,
mainly in  Egypt ,” where NBK’s Al-Watany Bank of Egypt accounts
for 6.1 percent of group assets, Moody’s said.  Moody’s also cited credit risk among Kuwaiti banks arising
from problems with Kuwaiti investment companies,  Kuwait ’s real
estate market and the weak performance of the Kuwait Stock
Exchange. The government’s spending plans are unlikely to be of
a scale that will revive credit growth, Moody’s said.  National Bank reported a 6 percent rise in first-quarter
profit to 80.8 million dinars ($294 million) as the lender
reduced its non-performing loan ratio. The bank’s shares rose
1.7 percent to 1,180 fils at the close in Kuwait today.  NBK’s “capitalization remains robust, underpinning its
loss absorption capacity” and making the bank well-placed for
growth once increased  government spending  emerges, Moody’s said.  Kuwait plans to increase spending by about 10 percent to
17.9 billion dinars in the fiscal year that started April 1 as
it steps up a development program that aims to boost energy
output and modernize transport links.  To contact the reporter on this story:
