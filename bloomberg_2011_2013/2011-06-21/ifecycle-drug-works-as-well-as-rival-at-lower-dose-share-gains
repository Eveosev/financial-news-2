LifeCycle Pharma A/S, which develops
treatments for transplant patients, said its experimental
medicine worked as well as  Astellas Pharma Inc. (4503) ’s Prograf at
lower doses. The shares rose as much as 40 percent.  LCP-Tacro taken once daily helped prevent  organ rejection 
in kidney transplant patients just as well as Prograf, which is
taken twice daily, the Hoersholm, Denmark-based company said
today. An analysis showed rejection rates after 12 months were
2.5 percent for LCP-Tacro and 4.9 percent for Prograf, LifeCycle
said.  Both LCP-Tacro and Prograf’s active ingredient is
tacrolimus, a chemical derived from a fungus, which suppresses
the immune system. Generic versions of Prograf in the U.S.,
where the medicine has lost patent protection, have dented
Astellas’ sales, the Tokyo-based company said in May.  LifeCycle said it’s awaiting results of another trial
before seeking regulatory approval in the U.S. and  Europe  in the
first quarter of 2013. Worldwide sales of treatments to prevent
the rejection of organs following a transplant exceed $5
billion, with Prograf having a market share of about 40 percent,
LifeCycle said.  LifeCycle gained as much as 0.54 krone in Copenhagen
trading, its biggest gain since the November 2006 listing. The
share rose 0.19 krone, or 14 percent, to 1.55 kroner at 12:06
p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
