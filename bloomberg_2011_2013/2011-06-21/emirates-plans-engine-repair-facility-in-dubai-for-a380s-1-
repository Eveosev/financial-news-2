Emirates, the world’s largest
airline by international traffic, will build a $120 million
engine repair and maintenance facility in Dubai for the upkeep
of power plants fitted to Boeing Co. 777s and Airbus A380s.  The engine shop will be capable of conducting 300 repairs
annually on GE90, made by General Electric Co., and GP7000
engines, made by Engine Alliance, Emirates said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “The growth of the Emirates fleet and the subsequent number
of operating engines have necessitated the need for an in-house
engine shop in Dubai to provide the most cost-effective,
efficient engine maintenance,” the carrier said.  The airline has signed a letter of intent with General
Electric Co. to oversee the design and construction of the site,
expected to begin in the first quarter of 2012, Emirates said.
GE formed Engine Alliance with partner  Pratt & Whitney .  The project will create more than 500 jobs, it added.
Emirates has a test cell facility and its current engine shop is
limited to module replacements only.  Emirates has 90 A380s on order and is targeting a fleet of
120. It has about the same number of 777s in operation or on
order, making it the model’s top user.  “The intention of the new Engine Shop is support the
requirements of Emirates’ 153 aircraft,” the company said.
“However, Emirates could consider additional third-party work
in the facility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
