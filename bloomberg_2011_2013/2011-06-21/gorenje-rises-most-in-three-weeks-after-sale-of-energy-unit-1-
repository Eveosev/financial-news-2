Gorenje Group d.d. rose the most in
three weeks in Ljubljana after the Slovenian appliance maker
sold a 46.5 percent stake in its energy unit Istrabenz Gorenje
d.o.o.  Shares of Gorenje gained 10 eurocents, or 1.1 percent, the
biggest advance since May 30, to close at 9.40 euros on the
Ljubljana stock exchange after rising as much as 1.6 percent in
earlier trading. That gives the Velenje-based company a market
value of 149.5 million euros ($215 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
