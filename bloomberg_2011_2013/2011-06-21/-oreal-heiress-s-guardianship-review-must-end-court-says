L’Oreal SA (OR)  heiress Liliane Bettencourt’s need for protection can’t be examined by a
guardianship judge because her daughter retracted a request for
such an assessment last year,  France ’s highest appeals court
said.  The daughter’s decision “puts an end to the authority” of
the guardianship judge, the Cour de Cassation judges wrote in an
 opinion  posted on the court’s website yesterday.  Bettencourt and her daughter Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers
concluded a settlement in December ending a three-year-old
dispute over the heiress’s generosity in granting gifts to a
friend. Bettencourt-Meyers questioned her mother’s mental
fitness and had asked a so-called guardianship judge to review
whether she needed to be monitored. That request was withdrawn
as part of the agreement.  As part of the settlement, Bettencourt’s lawyer Pascal
Wilhelm was named as a protector-in-waiting, should she be
deemed to need one. Her daughter asked the guardianship judge
this month whether it was possible to withdraw that status, on
concerns that an investment by Bettencourt in an online gaming
site company represented by the same lawyer showed he was not
acting in her best interests. The deal was canceled at the
request of the company’s owner, Le Point magazine reported June
15.  The Cour de Cassation didn’t consider this question,
saying that the fact that the initial application had been
withdrawn made the issue pointless.  Lawyers for Bettencourt and her daughter didn’t immediately
return calls for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
