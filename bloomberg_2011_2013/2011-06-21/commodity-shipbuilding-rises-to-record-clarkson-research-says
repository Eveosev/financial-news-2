Construction of ships to haul
commodities rose to a record, helping to cut transportation
costs for cargoes including coal, iron ore and grains,  Clarkson
Research Services Ltd.  said.  In the first five months of the year 429 vessels began
trading, up from 388 a year ago, according to data on the
website of  Clarkson Research , a unit of the world’s largest
shipbroker. The previous record for the period was set in 2010.  The global fleet of 8,446 bulk ships is growing nearly
three times faster than demand for seaborne agricultural and
mining bulk commodities, according to Clarkson’s data today.  Cargo shipped on bulk carriers will rise by 4 percent to
3.43 billion metric tons in the full-year for 2011, while fleet
capacity in the first five months of the year is 11 percent
higher than it was in 2010, it said.  About 44 percent of all new ships that started trading in
2011 were bulk carriers, including 139 in May, Clarkson said.  The new deliveries and fewer orders cut the list of all
ships scheduled to be built at the world’s shipyards to its
lowest level since July 2006. There were 6,914 ships on the
list, known in the industry as an orderbook, down 41 percent
from the September 2008 peak, Clarkson said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
