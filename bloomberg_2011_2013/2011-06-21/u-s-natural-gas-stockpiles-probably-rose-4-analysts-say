U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
rose by more than the seasonal average last week as milder
weather in the East reduced air-conditioning demand, according
to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories advanced 90 billion cubic feet, or 4 percent,
to 2.346 trillion cubic feet in the week ended June 17, based on
the median of five estimates. The five-year average stockpile
change for the week is an increase of 86 billion, according to
Energy Department data. Supplies climbed 81 billion cubic feet a
year earlier.  Temperatures in  New York  last week reached a high of 84
degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius) on June 16, compared with a high
of 95 degrees in the previous week, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. Rising nuclear-power
production also reduced gas consumption for electricity
generation.  “We had lower temperatures and the lack of tropical
activities,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst with PFGBest in
Chicago. “We also have some nuclear  power plants  coming out of
maintenance.”  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 88 billion
to 92 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department’s next weekly
supply report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. June 23 in
 Washington .  Temperatures were in a normal range last week in the U.S.
