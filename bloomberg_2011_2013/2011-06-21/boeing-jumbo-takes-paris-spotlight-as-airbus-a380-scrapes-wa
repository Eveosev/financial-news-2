Boeing Co. (BA) ’s four-decade-old 747
jumbo jet picked up a new fan base at the  Paris Air Show  as its
latest version won customers and eclipsed the bungled appearance
of Airbus SAS’s A380 flagship double-decker.  While Airbus draped the exhibition with billboards touting
the world’s largest passenger plane as “Love at First Flight,”
the A380’s initial rendezvous was with an airport building which
kissed a wingtip and forced a return to the factory for repairs.  The wing strike was a rare misstep at a show dominated by
orders for Airbus’s A320neo single-aisle model. With the damaged
A380 gone for the first two days of the show, Boeing’s 747-8
Intercontinental in red “sunrise” livery made its debut in the
expo’s static display and to add insult to injury won 19 orders
or commitments as Airbus’s superjumbo came away empty-handed.  “Many of our customers have called and said ‘Can I please
come and see your Intercontinental,’ and we love that because
usually we’re knocking on their door,” Elizabeth Lund, the 747
program chief, said in an interview at the show yesterday.
“We’ve gotten some great responses.”  Blue Danube Waltz  Airbus said the A380, which comes with a price tag of $375
million, brushed along a building and scraped off the outer part
of the wing. A Korean Air Lines Co. A380, already painted in
bright blue corporate livery, was put on flight display, soaring
through the skies with the Blue Danube Waltz by Johann Strauss
blaring over the Le Bourget exhibition fields.  The A380 has a wingspan of 262 feet (80 meters) and a 239-
foot fuselage. It stands almost 80 feet from the ground to the
top of its tail. The 747-8 passenger version’s wings span more
than 224 feet, its fuselage is 250 feet long and its tail is
63.5 feet tall. It is Chicago-based Boeing’s costliest jet, with
the freighter model listing for $319.3 million.  While Airbus’s top-selling A320neo has ruled the show,
Boeing has led in twin-aisle jets, even without the jumbo,
announcing 21 orders and commitments on the first two days as
its rival announced deals for 15 A330s. The A350, which enters
service from 2013, won its first contract only today, for six
planes for Kuwait-based Aviation Lease & Finance Co.  ‘Strange Contrast’  “There’s a strange contrast with the remarkable success of
the A320Neo series,” said  Richard Aboulafia , vice president of
Fairfax, Virginia-based aviation consultant Teal Group. “It’s
almost as though Airbus really needs to prove a point about
their A380 launch decision a decade ago.”  More orders may be in the offing, as the Paris exhibition
runs through this weekend, said Rainer Ohler, an Airbus
spokesman.  “Get ready for more A380 news before the end of the
show,” he said. “We always save the best for last.”  Airbus returned the damaged A380 today, the show’s third
day, to take over display duties after emergency repairs. The
run-in with the structure wasn’t Airbus’s only mishap. The
A400M, Airbus’s military transport, couldn’t perform a daily
flight routine because of a glitch in the gearbox.  Nor was the Paris swipe the A380’s first collision. An Air
France A380 struck a commuter plane’s tail at  New York ’s Kennedy
airport in April, spinning the smaller jet around by 90 degrees.
In 2007, an A380 carrying 150 passengers was delayed for more
than four hours after hitting a terminal building in  Thailand .  Airport Modifications  Airports have required modifications to accommodate the
plane. The  Port Authority  of New York and  New Jersey  spent $180
million to improve airport runways and taxiways to create enough
clearance for the A380 to maneuver safely on the ground.  Airbus is marketing the A380 as the largest, most fuel-
efficient and smoothest ride among its peers, carrying as many
as 800 passengers. Boeing had a monopoly on the jumbo market for
decades with its 747, which took its maiden flight in 1969, the
year  Neil Armstrong  became the first man to walk on the moon.  Boeing has since upgraded the 747 several times, stretching
the iconic hump to accommodate more passengers on the upper deck
and improving the aircraft’s performance. Deliveries exceed
1,400 so far, compared with 51 A380s handed over to customers
since the aircraft’s debut 2007.  Jumbo-Jet Delays  Neither program has been free on bungles. Airbus’s first
delivery, to  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , was years late, and the
A380’s development was billions of euros over budget. Boeing is
more than a year behind schedule on the 747 freighter, which is
more popular, as well as the passenger version.  “I’m very focused on the 747 this year, and I’ve made it a
priority that it’s the year of the 747,” Marlin Dailey,
Boeing’s sales chief, said today in an interview. “I’ve already
delivered three new customers this year; I’m working on the
fourth and I’m going to bring in more.”  Dailey said he is talking with existing 747 buyers about
“greater commitments” as well as with prospective customers.  Boeing has been more limited in the design choices
available for the 747’s interior than Airbus on its A380, which
can be feature enclosed cabins, showers and duty-free shops. The
747 has LED lighting with an optional “Disco Wave,” as Boeing
calls it, that cycles through a rainbow of colors.  Executives at Boeing decided to capitalize on the decade of
research done by architects and psychologists on the smaller 787
Dreamliner to add features to the 747-8 including more spacious
ceilings and overhead bins.  Boeing has won orders for 50 Intercontinental versions from
four airlines and eight VIP customers, along with a commitment
for five from  Air China Ltd. (601111) , and for 78 freighters from six
cargo carriers. Boeing began selling the freighter in late 2005
and the Intercontinental in December 2006.  Passengers Only  Airbus suspended the A380 freighter program in 2007. The
passenger version is being built at a rate of about 25 a year at
the main Airbus production hub in Toulouse. That’s less than a
month’s worth of output on the A320.  Airbus has 234 orders for the aircraft from 18 customers,
among them an individual buyer. The planemaker is considering a
stretched version that could carry close to 1,000 passengers,
Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders  said yesterday.  “My every instinct says that A380 orders are coming, maybe
at Paris, but just as likely at the Dubai Air Show in
November,” said  Sandy Morris , an analyst at Royal Bank of
Scotland who recommends buying the shares of Airbus parent
European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.  “It’s only two years since the world went to hell in a
hand basket,” damping airlines’ appetite for the plane, Morris
said, recalling the global financial collapse of 2008. “Give
the A380 time.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
