Jordan  Telecom Corp., one of the
countryâ€™s three mobile operators, plans to invest 50 million
dinars ($70.5 million) this year to develop faster 3G wireless
and Internet services, Chief Executive Officer Nayla Khawam
said.  The company, which started 3G service in Jordan in March
2010, had 500,000 users of the service at the end of May, Khawam
said today in an interview at a conference in Amman.  Zain Jordan, a unit of Kuwait-based Mobile
Telecommunications Co., is the largest mobile operator in Jordan
with 3.3 million subscribers and 39 percent of the market, Chief
Executive Officer Abdul Malik al-Jaber said May 31.  Umniah , a
unit of Bahrain Telecommunications Co., is the second-largest,
with 2.2 million subscribers and a market share of 31.5 percent,
Chief Executive Officer Ihab Hinnawi said last month.  Khawam declined to disclose the current number of mobile
subscribers for  Jordan Telecom. (JTEL)  The company had 2.8 million
subscribers a year ago, Khawam said in an interview in June last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
