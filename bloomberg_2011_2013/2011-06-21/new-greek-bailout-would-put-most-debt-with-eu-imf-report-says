A second financial aid package for
Greece would mean that European Union taxpayers, the  European
Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  would hold 64
percent of the country’s sovereign debt, according to research
group Open Europe.  As much as 250 billion euros ($359 billion) of Greek debt
could be held by those lenders in 2014, up from 85 billion euros
at the start of this year, the London-based research institute
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The study underlines the risks EU governments and the IMF
are taking as they contemplate offering more support to Greece,
which is the euro area’s most-indebted nation. Greek Prime
Minister George Papandreou today faces a confidence vote as he
struggles to convince lawmakers to accept austerity measures
that are part of a 78 billion-euro aid deal.  “Taxpayer-backed loans are gradually replacing private-
sector exposure,” Open Europe said. “The cost of a Greek
default to the European economy will only increase with time.”  EU member states have a total exposure to  Greece  of 331
billion euros, including the debt held by their banks on top of
government loans and ECB holdings, Open Europe said. France and
 Germany  account for about half of the total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
