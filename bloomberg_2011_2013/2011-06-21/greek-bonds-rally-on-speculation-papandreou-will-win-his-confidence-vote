Greece’s government bonds rose amid
speculation Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will win a
confidence vote today, paving the way for the country to receive
financial aid.  Two-year notes gained for a third consecutive day, driving
the yield on the securities down by the most in more than two
weeks. Greek 10-year bonds also rose. European Union leaders
have insisted Papandreou secure multi-party support to implement
austerity measures that are a condition of the aid needed to
avoid default as soon as next month. German bunds fell before
the nation sells an additional 4 billion euros ($5.8 billion) of
10-year securities tomorrow.  “There’s some confidence building up in the market that
Papandreou will win his vote,” said  Glenn Marci , a strategist
at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “If he achieves that, there will be
a level of relief.”  Greek two-year note yields, which surpassed 30 percent for
the first time last week, fell 97 basis points to 27.64 percent
as of 5 p.m. in  London . The 4.6 percent security due May 2013
rose 0.995, or 9.95 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 68.965.
The 10-year bond yield dropped 37 basis points to 16.97 percent.
It rose to a euro-era record 18.35 percent on June 17.  Greek and Portuguese securities have both lost 19 percent
in 2011, while Irish debt has dropped 11 percent, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German  government bonds  have
returned 0.3 percent in 2011, while Treasuries gained 3.3
percent the indexes show.  German Confidence  German bonds fell today, even as a report showed investor
confidence in  Europe ’s largest economy dropped to the least in 2
1/2 years. The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in
Mannheim said its index of investor and analyst expectations,
which aims to predict developments six months in advance, fell
to minus 9 from plus 3.1 in May. That’s the lowest since
January, 2009. Economists predicted a decline to minus 3,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose two basis points to 2.98
percent, after dropping earlier to 2.95 percent. It declined to
2.905 percent on June 16, the least since Jan. 11.  Yields on two-year notes were one basis point higher at
1.53 percent. They dropped to 1.43 percent on June 16, the
lowest since Feb. 22.  ‘Must-Clear Hurdle’  Bunds have gained this year as investors sought a haven
amid mounting concern that policy makers will fail to contain
the euro region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The yield on  Greece ’s two-year note has plunged more than
200 basis points, or 2 percentage points, in three days as
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  dropped calls for a mandatory
bond exchange that might lead credit-rating companies to declare
Greece in default.  Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said
yesterday that Papandreou assured him the government would do
everything to avoid defaulting.  “The market’s focus is very much on Greece, and the no-
confidence vote is in the spotlight,” said  David Schnautz , a
fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.
“Papandreou needs to get over that hurdle. There may be signs
of more erosion of his support, and that may not go down well
with the market. It’s a must-clear hurdle.”  Greek Bill Sale  Greece sold 1.25 billion euros of 91-day Treasury bills at
an average yield of 4.62 percent. Investors bid for 2.94 times
the amount of debt on offer. That compares with a so-called bid-
to-cover ratio of 3.3 at the previous auction of similar
securities held on May 17, which were allotted at 4.06 percent.  Portuguese 10-year yields fell two basis points to 11.13
percent. They reached an all-time high of 11.19 percent
yesterday. Two-year note yields added two basis points to 13.21
percent after reaching a record 13.26 percent yesterday.  Irish 10-year yields declined six basis points to 11.40
percent. The yield jumped to a record 11.70 percent on June 17.  Spain  sold 3 billion euros of three- and six-month bills.
The Treasury in  Madrid  said it sold 632 million euros of three-
month bills at an average yield of 1.568 percent, compared with
1.380 percent at the last sale on May 24. Spain also sold 2.36
billion euros of six-month debt at an average yield of 1.776
percent, compared with 1.766 percent on May 24.  Ministers at a euro-crisis meeting in Luxembourg
“forcefully reminded the Greek government” to fulfill its
commitments, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told
reporters yesterday. Decisions on the next payout and a three-
year follow-up package were put off until early July.  The  International Monetary Fund , contributor of a third of
the bailout money for Greece, Ireland and  Portugal , has warned
European leaders that a failure to take decisive action on the
debt crisis risks triggering “large global spillovers.” At the
same time, Papandreou is struggling to convince Greeks to accept
a 78 billion-euro package of state-asset sales and budget cuts,
which include a “crisis levy” on wages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
