OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-biggest
gas producer, will decide on further exploration at its
development in  Egypt  in September after writing off some wells,
Chief Financial Officer Mark Gyetvay said.  Gyetvay was speaking to reporters in London today. He
didn’t say how many wells were written off as Novatek processes
data from the El-Arish oil and gas project.  Novatek said in January that exploration wasn’t affected
while evacuating some workers during civil unrest in the North
African country. The Russian gas producer bought 50 percent of
El-Arish from Egypt’s state-owned Tharwa Petroleum SAE in
September 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
