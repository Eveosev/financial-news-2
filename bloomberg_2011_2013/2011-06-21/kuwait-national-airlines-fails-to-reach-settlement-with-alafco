Kuwait National Airlines Co. (KNA)  K.S.C.
failed to reach a settlement with Aviation Lease & Finance Co.
on the payment of $70 million for an aircraft leasing deal,
Kuwait National said in a statement to the Kuwait Stock Exchange
today.  Aviation Lease, known as Alafco, hasn’t yet received any
response to a final settlement proposal sent to Kuwait National
on June 14, Alafco also said in a statement to the Kuwait bourse
today.  Shareholders in Kuwait National Airlines, the holding
company that owns Wataniya Airways, in May postponed a vote on
raising the company’s capital to 65 million dinars ($237
million), pending agreement by the company on Alafco’s demands.
Kuwaiti carrier Wataniya Airways halted operations in March, two
years after starting up.  Alafco said in April that it had signed a deal to lease
three aircraft to Wataniya from 2009 to 2017 and that the
airline’s ceasing of operations “is regarded as a breach to the
deal.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
