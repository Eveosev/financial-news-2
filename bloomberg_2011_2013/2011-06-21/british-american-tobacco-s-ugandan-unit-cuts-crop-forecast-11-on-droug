British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) ’s
Ugandan unit, the country’s biggest producer of the leaf, cut
its crop forecast for this year by 11 percent after a drought,
and said a stunted harvest may further pressure estimates.  Contracted farmers may produce as much as 16,000 metric
tons this year, from an earlier forecast of 18,000 tons, Solomon
Muyita, the corporate and regulatory affairs coordinator at BAT
Uganda Ltd., said in an e-mailed response to questions today.  “Our farmers, especially in the main tobacco growing area
of West Nile, didn’t receive enough rain this season to support
a good crop,” Muyita wrote. “Because of the adverse drought in
the first half of 2011, it will be no surprise if our new volume
targets also drop.” The harvest will still be larger than last
year’s 14,000 tons as the company controlled pests and diseases.  Harvesting and curing of the crop has begun, with marketing
expected to start in early July, Muyita said. Aerial surveys
show the crop from West Nile is “generally stunted,” he said.  BAT  Uganda  produces mainly flue-cured tobacco, dried in a
closed barn with heat piped from a furnace, and burley, treated
in the open air, according to the company. Small quantities of
lower-quality dark fire-cured tobacco are also produced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
