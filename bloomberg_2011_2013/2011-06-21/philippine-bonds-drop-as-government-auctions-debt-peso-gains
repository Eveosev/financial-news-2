Philippine 10-year bonds declined
after the government sold debt at yields higher than similar-
maturity bonds in the secondary market. The peso climbed from a
three-month low.  The government sold 9 billion pesos ($207 million) of 10-
year securities at an average yield of 6.436 percent, compared
with 6.445 percent at the last sale of such debt on April 26.
The bid-to-cover ratio at today’s auction was 2.36. Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas is watching oil and food prices and will
“keep an eye on liquidity” as the annual inflation target of 3
percent to 5 percent is “still at risk,” Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday.  The yield on the 7.375 percent note due March 2021 rose
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, from June 17 to
6.35 percent as of 4:32 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tradition

higher,” said Yvette Marquez-Carlos, who helps manage the

earlier, the most since April 2010. Bangko Sentral last week
ordered lenders to set aside more money as reserves and held its
benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent after raising it two
times this year.  The central bank’s recent actions are “part of the
normalization of monetary policy,” Tetangco said. “The
question is, whether there is going to be a need for further
action moving forward.”  The  Philippines  plans to issue 10- and 20-year bonds in a
debt exchange that will start on June 28, Deputy Treasurer
Eduardo Mendiola told reporters in Manila today. The Bureau of
the Treasury hired  Land Bank  of the Philippines,  Development
Bank  of the Philippines and four other banks to manage the bond
swap, Mendiola said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
