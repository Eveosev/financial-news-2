Gold rose for the sixth straight
session as concern that  Greece  may default on its debts boosted
the appeal of the metal as an investment haven.  Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou’s government faces a
confidence vote today that may determine whether the country
becomes the first euro-area nation to default.  “Gold may continue to be the beneficiary of events in
Greece, where uncertainty will continue to dominate,” said Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.  Gold futures for August delivery rose $4.40, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,546.40 an ounce on the Comex in  New
York . The price has climbed 2 percent in the six sessions
through today, the longest rally since April.  The precious metal touched a record $1,577.40 on May 2 as
escalating sovereign-debt woes and record-low U.S. borrowing
costs increased the appeal of bullion as an alternative to
currencies. Gold denominated in euros reached an all-time high
on May 25.  “We remain bullish of gold in non-U.S. dollar terms,”
said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 30.8 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $36.379 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for July delivery climbed $16.70, or 1
percent, to $1,747.20 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Palladium futures for September delivery rose $19.05, or
2.5 percent, to $767.25 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
