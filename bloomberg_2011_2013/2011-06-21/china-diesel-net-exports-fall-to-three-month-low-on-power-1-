China , the world’s second-largest
oil user, reduced net diesel exports to the lowest in three
months in May after power shortages boosted demand for the fuel.  Exports exceeded imports by 50,000 metric tons last month
from 90,000 tons in April, according to data from General
Administration of Customs. Imports of the fuel were unchanged at
130,000 tons from a month earlier and exports fell to 180,000
tons, the lowest since January.  China suspended diesel exports last month, excluding
shipments to Macau and  Hong Kong , to bolster domestic supplies
after manufacturers turned to diesel-fueled generators following
a rationing of electricity by local governments. China may need
an extra 1 million tons of the fuel a month in the third quarter
because of the power shortage, Gong Manying, a market research
director at PetroChina Co., said June 16.  China bought diesel at $982 a ton last month, up from $974
a ton in April, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
today’s data.  Net exports of gasoline fell to 259,963 tons, the least
since February last year, ahead of the summer consumption peak.
Net exports of kerosene rose to 250,000 tons from 80,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
