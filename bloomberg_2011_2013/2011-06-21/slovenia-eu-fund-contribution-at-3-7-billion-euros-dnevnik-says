Slovenia’s participation in the
European Financial Stability Facility will increase to 3.7
billion euros ($5.3 billion) from 2 billion euros ,  Dnevnik
 reported, citing Finance Minister  Franc Krizanic .  The increase will prompt Slovenia to revise legislation,
the newspaper said. Krizanic doesn’t expect any problems with
that because of the importance of the euro for Slovenia, the
Ljubljana-based newspaper reported.  The European Financial Stability Facility was set up after
the Greek rescue last year to stop the crisis spreading to other
euro-region nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
