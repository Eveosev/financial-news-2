The Australian dollar dropped
against the greenback after the  Federal Reserve  lowered its
forecast for U.S. economic growth, discouraging demand for
higher-yielding assets including stocks.  “The Aussie came off,” said Robert Sinche, global head of
currency strategy in Stamford, Connecticut, at Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc. “The shorter-terms moves have been dominated by
what’s been going on in equities.”  Australia’s dollar slid 0.3 percent to $1.0573 at 3:55
p.m. in New York, from $1.0605 yesterday. New Zealand’s currency
pared its gain, rising 0.2 percent to 81.44 U.S. cents after
earlier appreciating 0.9 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index decreased 0.5 percent,
while the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.5 percent.  Fed governors and regional-bank presidents now say the  U.S.
economy  will expand by 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent this year,
down from April’s forecasts of 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent, based
on the median range of projections. Growth in 2012 will range
from 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent, compared with forecasts of 3.5
percent to 4.2 percent in April, the Fed said.  The U.S. central bank refrained from signaling additional
economic stimulus after the completion this month of its
$600 billion bond-purchase program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
