Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Chairman  Sheila Bair  said the agency’s Advisory Panel on
Systemic Resolutions “represents the best of both private and
public experience” to help map strategy for dealing with too-
big-to-fail firms in the event of a collapse.  “The committee members have a wide range of knowledge and
experience,” Bair said today in opening remarks for the 18-
member panel’s inaugural meeting in Washington.  Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker  and former
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  co-chairman  John Reed  are serving on the panel
along with executives including BlackRock Inc. fixed-income
chief  Peter Fisher  and  Standard & Poor’s  President Deven Sharma.  The Dodd-Frank Act gave the FDIC responsibility for
resolving systemically important financial firms if they should
fail. Lawmakers granted the authority to prevent a repeat of the
market tumult that followed the 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., which sparked a credit freeze that led
to government bailouts for companies including Citigroup.  “Post-crisis there is a natural tendency for memories to
fade,” Bair said today. There will be a need for a robust
resolution planning process to restore balance to the financial
system, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
