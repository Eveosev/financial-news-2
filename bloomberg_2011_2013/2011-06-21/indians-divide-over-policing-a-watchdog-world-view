Can political corruption in  India  be addressed by reforming  the institutions currently assigned to check it, or does the country need a new vigilance institution to help restore trust in its corruption-blotted democracy? Has the Indian Parliament reneged on its primary function, which is to debate and pass laws? And if so, can citizens’ groups, or “civil society,” come up with draft bills of laws, or would such a step be extra-constitutional? Should the position of an ombudsman, or “Lokpal” -- from the Sanskrit roots "lok" (people) and "pal" (protector) -- be set up to investigate corruption and maladministration at the highest level? What kinds of checks and balances would be placed upon the office of the Lokpal itself? And would its powers of investigation extend to the highest office in the land -- the prime minister -- and to the judiciary? More widely, are hunger strikes to the death a legitimate method of exerting pressure on the government to address the issue? And wider still, what are the duties and responsibilities of citizenship in a democracy and have Indian citizens been remiss in fulfilling them? All these questions have been widely debated by Indian citizens over the last three months and in  New Delhi's North Block  in the last week, as  a ten-member committee  made up of five ministers and five representatives of civil society sat down to thrash out their differences and ready a draft of the Lokpal Bill by the end of the month. The civil society group included four members of the campaign  India Against Corruption , which earlier this year began a nationwide protest that was seen by  some commentators  as India’s own version of  Egypt 's Tahrir Square movement, a spontaneous mass uprising against longstanding governmental apathy.  Others  perceived it as an emotive and misguided attempt to promote a utopian one-step solution to corruption. Indian citizens have a right to be skeptical of the government’s interest in getting the bill through Parliament, as the draft legislation has been bouncing between the two houses of the legislature, the  Lok Sabha  and the Rajya Sabha, for more than four decades. As the journalist Pradeep Baisakh explained a few years ago in a piece on the  history of the bill : Anna Hazare , a veteran social activist who in April had begun a  fast unto death  to force the government to table a bill guaranteeing comprehensive and not cosmetic powers to the proposed Lokpal, was among those on the Joint Drafting Committee. The two halves of the panel sparred all week over a final version of the bill that melded the government’s own draft  with the one prepared by India Against Corruption (called the “ Jan Lokpal Bill ”, or “The Lokpal Bill of the People”). Each side made derisive remarks about the  other in the press. Arvind Kejriwal, one of the members on the civil-society side, devised the pun “ Jokepal Bill ” to mock the draft favored by the government side;  Kapil Sibal , one of the ministers on the committee, said Hazare was "like the  Pied Piper of Hamlin ," (an analogy with very low recognition value in India). The committee's last meeting was June 20, and its resolutions were reported the next day by The Indian Express in a piece titled " In Final Lap, Rush To Reconcile ": In a piece in the Hindustan Times called “ Who’s Afraid of the Lokpal Bill? ,” Jagdeep Chhokar played down fears that the bill would supply the Lokpal with draconian powers and an impossible roster of responsibilities, and concluded by saying: In an acute piece in  The Telegraph  on Anna Hazare's fast in April, and his threat to begin another fast unto death  Aug. 16  if a diluted bill was presented to Parliament, the academic Prabhat Patnaik made several telling points. He argued that, contrary to popular perception, Hazare's fasts were not "Gandhian," since Gandhi always used the practice of fasts not to sway governments but instead in opposition to the people. The difference between the two, Patnaik argued, was the difference between violence and non-violence: A different, out-of-the-box approach to the intricate tangle of corruption, government,  law enforcement , policy, democracy and discontent was taken recently by the lawyer Gautam Patel in the Economic and Political Weekly. In an essay called “ What We Talk About When We Talk About Corruption ,” he suggested that corruption might be thought of as existing not just on the level of financial malfeasance but at the very level of policy, and that the proposed bill would hand the Lokpal too much power. He wrote: The argument that civil society was trampling upon the dignity, legitimacy and sovereignty of Parliament in seeking to draft laws was vigorously contested by MG Vaidya, a former spokesperson for the  Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh , who wrote an acerbic piece called " The Sovereign's Right " in the Indian Express last week: Analyzing the context in which popular discontent about political malfeasance had finally detonated in “a season of outrage,” the political scientist Sunil Khilnani, author of the book The Idea of India, wrote in an essay in the weekend paper Mint Lounge called “ The Social Network ” : Khilnani's words were echoed by the columnist Tavleen Sing in a piece called " Postcard From A Private Club ," which bemoaned the narrowing and the feudalization of Indian democracy: Expect plenty more on the Lokpal Bill in this space in the months to come.
