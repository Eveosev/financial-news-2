International Monetary Fund acting
head  John Lipsky  urged euro-area governments to stop bickering
and agree on further aid for debt-strapped Greece,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  said, citing comments after a finance ministers’ meeting
in Luxembourg.  Lipsky said yesterday it’s essential to end the debate
about restructuring quickly, the Munich-based  newspaper  reported
today. The crisis in peripheral euro nations requires additional
aid and attention to prevent it from spreading to Europe’s
center and the rest of the world, the IMF official was quoted as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
