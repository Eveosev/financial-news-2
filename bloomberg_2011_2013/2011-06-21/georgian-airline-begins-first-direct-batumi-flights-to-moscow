Georgia’s national airline  is
starting the first direct flights between Moscow and the port
city of Batumi as the Black Sea nation seeks to boost tourism in
the Adjara region.  Airzena Georgian Airways will operate weekly  charter
flights  starting today and until October because of high demand
for the route, Nino Giorgobiani, a spokeswoman at the Tbilisi-
based carrier, said by phone from Batumi.  Georgia expects as many as 3 million visitors by the end of
the year, 50 percent more than last year and the highest figure
since 2003, Economy and Sustainable Development Minister Vera
Kobalia has said.  Tourism will probably account for 6 percent of Georgia’s
gross domestic product next year, up from a 5 percent share in
2011, Kobalia said last week. The number of visitors has begun
to increase since  Georgia ’s five-day war with Russia in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
