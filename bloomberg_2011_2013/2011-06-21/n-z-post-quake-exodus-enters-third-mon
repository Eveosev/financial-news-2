More migrants left  New Zealand  than
arrived for a third straight month in May, the most prolonged
decline in 10 years, as people relocated after an earthquake
struck the nation’s second-biggest city.  Permanent migrant departures exceeded arrivals by 360 in
May following readings of 130 in April and 520 in March,
 Statistics New Zealand  said in Wellington today. In the year
ended May 31, arrivals outpaced departures by 4,625, the lowest
number since the 12 months through January 2009.  Slowing migration adds to the evidence for weaker growth
and a declining labor supply this year after the magnitude 6.3
quake killed more than 180 people, wrecked houses and closed
businesses in Christchurch on Feb. 22. The central bank may hold
borrowing costs at record lows for longer after Christchurch was
struck last week by aftershocks, pushing interest-rate swaps to
the lowest this month.  “Taxpayers fleeing the country will hamper the
government’s desire to swiftly restore the budget to surplus,
while a softer economy for longer keeps the  Reserve Bank  on hold
for longer,”  Annette Beacher , head of Asia-Pacific research at
TD Securities in  Singapore , said in an e-mailed note.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed after the report.
It bought 81.08 U.S. cents at 12:25 p.m. in Wellington from
81.01 cents immediately before the release. The two-year swap
rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating rates, rose one
basis point to 3.32 percent, after touching 3.275 percent on
June 17, the lowest since May 24.  Gross domestic product will rise 2.1 percent in the year
ending March 31, 2012, according to the average forecast of 11
economists surveyed by the New Zealand Institute of Economic
Research Inc.  Christchurch Departures  Permanent departures of Christchurch residents in the three
months through May were 1,300 more than the year-earlier period,
the statistics agency said. About 400 fewer people arrived in
the city, the statistics agency said.  Many of the residents departing are heading to  Australia , a
country with five times New Zealand’s population of 4.4 million
people that is little more than three hours away by aircraft and
offers employment and higher wages as its economy benefits from
demand for mineral exports.  There were 4,350 more citizens who departed permanently for
Australia in the three months through May than a year earlier,
today’s report showed. The annual flow to Australia was 38,899
persons, rising 12,128 from the year through May 2010.  More New Zealanders also departed on overseas trips for
holidays or business, today’s report showed. Short-term
departures rose 9.9 percent in May from a year earlier, and
increased 6.6 percent in the year ended May 31.  Short-term visitor arrivals fell 0.4 percent from May last
year, and annual arrivals rose 1 percent, adding to signs that
growth is sluggish in the  tourism industry , which makes up about
9 percent of the economy.  More migrants left New Zealand than arrived for 16 straight
months through March 2001, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
