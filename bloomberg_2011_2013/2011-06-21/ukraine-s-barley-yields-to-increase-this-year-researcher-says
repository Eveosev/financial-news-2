Ukraine’s barley yields will
increase this year by 8.7 percent to 2.13 metric tons a hectare
(2.47 acres) though spring barley was damaged by high
temperatures, UkrAgroConsult said.  Winter barley is “remarkably good,” Liza Malyshko, an
analyst at the Kiev-based researcher, said by phone today.
Average barley yields are expected to be 2.13 tons a hectare
this year compared with 1.96 million tons last year, Malyshko
said. Spring barley plants are “low and poorly tillered,” the
researcher said in an e-mailed statement, though the situation
improved in areas where rains fell in June.  Ukraine lost about 6 million tons of grain in last year’s
drought, which prompted the eastern European nation to introduce
export quotas in October that lasted almost eight months. The
government is to impose duties on outbound shipments from July
through the end of December, with barley taxed at 14 percent.  Farmers planted 2.5 million hectares of spring barley this
year, or 8.1 percent less than a year earlier, according to the
state statistics office. Winter barley accounted for 1.2 million
hectares, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
