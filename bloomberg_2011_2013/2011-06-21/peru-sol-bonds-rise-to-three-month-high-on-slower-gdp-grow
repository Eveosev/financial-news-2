Peru ’s sol-denominated bonds rose to
a three-month high, pushing yields down, as traders bet slowing
mining investment will ease pressure on the central bank to
raise borrowing costs.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 6.37 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The bond’s price increased 0.28 centimo to 110.09
centimos per sol.  The central bank trimmed its forecast for economic growth
June 17 as private investment slows amid concern that President-
elect  Ollanta Humala ’s plans to introduce a mining windfall tax
could make the country’s mines less competitive.  Peru’s central bank will keep its benchmark rate unchanged
at 4.25 percent for the rest of this year amid slowing growth
and easing inflationary pressures, Barclays Capital Inc. said
yesterday in an e-mailed report to clients. Barclays said April
1 the central bank will raise the rate to 5.5 percent by August.  “With Humala winning the election, you should have
significant consequences for mining regulation,” said Gustavo Rangel, an economist at ING Financial Markets in  New York . “We
don’t necessarily know what Humala will do. If I were an
investor in Peru’s mining sector, I would wait. As mining
investors wait, GDP growth immediately takes a hit.”  The economy will expand 6.5 percent this year, the central
bank said, down from a forecast of 7 percent growth three months
ago, and compared with an 8.8 percent expansion in 2010.  Mining projects will account for almost half the $47.5
billion of private investment expected in Peru from 2011 to
2013, according to the central bank.  Peruvian bonds are “cheap” given the pause in monetary
tightening and the chance of “positive surprises” from Humala
when names his cabinet, Barclays said.  The sol gained 0.2 percent to 2.7545 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7606 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
