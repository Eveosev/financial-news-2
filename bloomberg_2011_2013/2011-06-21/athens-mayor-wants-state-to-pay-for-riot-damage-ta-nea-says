Athens  Mayor George Kaminis wants
the Greek government to pay for damage to the city centre in the
aftermath of anti-austerity riots last week,  Ta Nea  reported,
citing comments from a city council meeting.  Kaminis said the city is already financially strapped, with
revenue in April down 30 percent from the same month a year
earlier, and can’t afford to pay for the damage, the newspaper
said. Kaminis said the city would consider legal action to
secure the funds if they’re not given by the state, the Athens-
based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
