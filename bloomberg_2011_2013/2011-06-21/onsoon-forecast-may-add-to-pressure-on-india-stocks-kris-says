Arun Kejriwal, a director at
Mumbai-based Kejriwal Research & Investment Services Pvt.,
comments on the outlook for stocks after the weather bureau said
monsoon rainfall may be less than the long-term average.  Precipitation in the June-September rainy season, the main
source of irrigation for the nation’s 235 million farmers, may
be 95 percent of the 50-year average, the weather office said
in a statement today after markets closed. Showers would be 98
percent of the long-period average, the office said April 19.  “The market tone is currently bearish and confused. A
comment like this will affect sentiments and only add to the
pressure on stocks. Volumes in the market have to improve for
this panic to subside.  ‘‘Investors will have to kill time in such a market and
wait for first-quarter results, which may offer some triggers.’’  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index rebounded from
its lowest close in four months today, gaining 0.3 percent to
17,560.30 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The gauge has lost
14 percent of its value this year, the worst performer in  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
