Crude oil inventories fell 81,000
barrels last week to 363 million, the  American Petroleum
Institute  said today.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.52 million barrels to 211.9
million, the report showed.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Analysts expect the government report to show stockpiles of
crude oil fell over the period. Supplies probably dropped 1.83
million barrels, according to the median of 16 responses in a
Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline inventories increased 1 million
barrels, the survey showed.  Oil-supply totals from the API and DOE have moved in the
same direction 72 percent of the time over the past year.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for August delivery fell 4 cents to $93.59 a
barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract traded at $93.76 before
release of the report at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
