India ’s benchmark stock index
rebounded from the lowest close in four months amid speculation
the recent decline was excessive and as investor concern eased
that Greece may default on its debt.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s most valuable company,
increased 1.9 percent, halting seven days of losses.  Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software exporter, surged
most in two months.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the
biggest mortgage lender, climbed the most in three weeks.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
53.67, or 0.3 percent, to 17,560.30 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai. It climbed as much as 1.2 percent earlier. Its 14-day
relative strength index, a gauge of how rapidly prices gained or
fell during the specified period, reached 28.7 yesterday. A
reading below 30 is a signal to buy for some investors.  “We are incrementally turning more and more bullish,”
said Sampath Reddy, who manages $6.7 billion as chief investment
officer for equities at Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co.
“Valuations have corrected to attractive levels. We are eagerly
looking to invest more money in equity markets in the next
couple of months.” Reddy is overweight on shares of drug
makers, fast-moving consumer goods and telecom companies.  Asian stocks increased for the first time in five days as
concern eased that  Greece  will default after Luxembourg’s Jean-
Claude Juncker, leader of euro-area finance ministers, indicated
a solution to the crisis will be found.  The Sensex slumped to a four-month low yesterday after a
report the government sought to tax gains on investments routed
through Mauritius sparked a selloff. The gauge has declined 14
percent in 2011, the worst performer in  Asia . Sensex stocks are
valued at 14.3 times estimated earnings, compared with 10.8 for
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Nifty Outlook  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.3 percent to 5,275.85 and its June futures settled at
5,276.10. The BSE 200 Index increased 0.1 percent to 2,182.50.  About sixty-four percent of local brokers expect the Nifty
to drop as much as 5 percent and trade in the range of 5,000 to
5,200, according to a survey of 20 brokerages by Bloomberg UTV.
The brokers are bullish on shares of telecom and  consumer goods 
companies. They are negative on shares of automakers, software,
cement, metals, infrastructure and state-run lenders.  “Markets could be very volatile in the short term, given
the kind of headwinds we’re facing, whether it’s the Greece
concern or the interest rate hikes that have been happening,”
Bajaj’s Reddy said. “The headwinds will probably be over in a
couple of months or so.”  Reliance, TCS Recover  Reliance Industries, owner of the world’s largest refining
complex, advanced 1.9 percent to 848.65 rupees, its steepest
climb in two weeks. Yesterday, the stock fell to its lowest
level since April 2009. Tata Consultancy Services jumped 3.5
percent to 1,106.75 rupees, reversing four days of slide.
Housing Development Finance increased 2.1 percent to 643.05
rupees and its June futures settled at 633 rupees.  The central bank raised the repurchase rate to 7.5 percent
from 7.25 percent on June 16, extending the longest streak of
tightening in a decade, joining its peers from  China  to  South
Korea  in stepping up the fight against surging living costs.  Rising borrowing costs have begun to crimp demand. India’s
$1.4 trillion economy expanded 7.8 percent in the three months
through March 31, the slowest pace in five quarters.  Overseas investors sold a net 3.63 billion rupees ($80.8
million) of Indian stocks on June 17, taking total withdrawals
this year to 11.7 billion rupees, according to data on the
 website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
