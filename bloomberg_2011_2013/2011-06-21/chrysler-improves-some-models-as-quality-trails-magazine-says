Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker controlled by  Fiat SpA (F) , improved its Dodge Durango
sport-utility vehicle and Charger sedan as its models continued
to trail rivals in overall quality, Consumer Reports said.  While redesigns of the Durango and Charger won the vehicles
“very good” road-test scores, the models placed below offerings
from Ford Motor Co.,  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  General Motors Co. (GM) ,
the non-profit magazine said in an e-mailed statement. Consumer
Reports didn’t give either vehicle a “recommended” label, its
highest ranking.  Consumer Reports tested eight of the Auburn Hills,
Michigan-based automaker’s vehicles and said five of them
“remain unimpressive.” The Chrysler 200 and Dodge Avenger
sedans and Dodge Journey, Jeep Patriot and Jeep Compass SUVs are
“mediocre vehicles,” the magazine said. The Chrysler Town &
Country minivan was rated “very good.”  “Chrysler is on the right path, but they still have a long
way to go,”  David Champion , senior director of Consumer
Reports’ auto test center, said in the statement.  Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of both
automakers, is working to improve Chrysler Group vehicles’
quality as part of a plan to boost global sales 32 percent.
Chrysler last month reported its first quarterly profit since
emerging from bankruptcy in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
