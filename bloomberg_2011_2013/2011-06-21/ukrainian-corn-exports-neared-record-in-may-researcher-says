Ukrainian corn exports reached 1.05
million metric tons in May, the second-highest on record after
the 1.07 million tons shipped in December 2009, according to
UkrAgroConsult.  Outbound shipments of grains last month increased to 1.157
million tons from 424,000 tons a month earlier, the Kiev-based
researcher said in an e-mailed statement today. Corn was
delivered to Egypt, Spain and  Iran , it said.  The eastern European nation canceled corn export quotas on
May 5 after seven months. Wheat and barley quotas were scrapped
on June 4. Authorities will tax grain exports from next month
through December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
