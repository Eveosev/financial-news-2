The Brazilian government is studying
an additional tax on the country’s most profitable mining
projects, Folha de S.Paulo reported, without saying where it got
the information.  The windfall tax would apply to 25 percent of the country’s
mining concessions including mines operated by  Vale SA (VALE5) , the
newspaper said.  Mining companies currently pay 2 percent of net sales on
their concessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
