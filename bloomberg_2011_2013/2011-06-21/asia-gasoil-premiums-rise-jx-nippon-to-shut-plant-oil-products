Asia gasoil premiums traded at the
highest in five weeks after BP Plc bought an ultra-low-sulfur
cargo in  Singapore . JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. planned to shut
its Kawasaki naphtha cracker for repairs.  Middle Distillates  BP paid $2.30 a barrel over benchmark quotes for 150,000
barrels of gasoil with 10 parts-per-million of sulfur from
PetroChina Co., according to a survey of traders and brokers
monitoring transactions on the Platts trading window. That’s the
biggest premium since PetroChina sold at plus $2.60 on May 18.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude dropped 34
cents to $19.07 a barrel at 5:30 p.m. Singapore time, based on
data from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. The difference, a
measure of refining profit known as the crack spread, was the
narrowest since June 2.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising to
$1.25 a barrel, the highest this month, PVM said.  Light Distillates  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline for loading from Singapore was
sold at $118.80 a barrel, according to the survey. That’s up
from $117.30 a barrel yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley sold a cargo for July 11 to July 15
loading to Vitol, they said.  Cargoes of 97-RON traded at $124.70 a barrel. Royal Dutch
Shell Plc bought 50,000 barrels for loading July 6 to July 10
from PetroChina and another 50,000 barrels for the same period
from BP.  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  traded
between $933.50 and $935 a metric ton, with first-half August
cargoes $1.50 a ton cheaper than those for second-half August,
according to the Platts survey. Shell bought from Vitol Group
and BP.  The crack spread, or premium, of Japan-delivered naphtha to
 Brent crude , fell to $78.57 a ton at 5:30 p.m. Singapore time
from $83.33 at the end of Asian trading on June 17, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on data from PVM Oil Associates.
Naphtha swaps for July were at $922.75 a ton, PVM data showed.  JX Nippon, Japan’s largest refiner and a unit of JX
Holdings Inc., plans to shut the naphtha cracker at its Kawasaki
plant for repairs.  The facility, capable of producing 448,000 tons of ethylene
a year, will close from June 27 to July 1, said a JX spokesman
who declined to be identified, citing company policy.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 28 cents to
$6.53 a barrel, according to PVM. The difference was the
narrowest since March 15, signaling reduced losses for refiners
turning oil into residual products.  July high-sulfur fuel oil swaps rebounded 75 cents to
$643.50 a ton, snapping a six-day losing streak, PVM said. The
premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade
decreased 75 cents to $10.75. The difference, or viscosity
spread, was at the narrowest this month, signaling bunker, or
marine fuel, has declined less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
