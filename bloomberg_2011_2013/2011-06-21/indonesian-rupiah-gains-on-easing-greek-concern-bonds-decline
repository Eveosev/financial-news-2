Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced the most
in more than two weeks as concern that Greece would default on
its debt eased, boosting investor appetite for emerging-market
assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional stocks rose for the
first time in a week after Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  had assured
him that his government would take the steps needed to obtain
financial aid from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund .  “The market believes the European Union is close to an
agreement to help Greece,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency
analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “Stocks in  Asia  are
up.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.2 percent to 8,601 per dollar as
of 3:59 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest one-day gain since June 3. The currency will
probably trade in a range of 8,500 to 8,700 per dollar in the
next three months, Martumpal forecast.  The rupiah has appreciated 4.4 percent this year as global
funds increased holdings of government debt by 21 percent to
237.79 trillion rupiah ($27.7 billion) through June 17,
according to data from the  debt management office .  The  finance ministry  sold 3 trillion rupiah of bonds and
bills in an auction today, less than the 7 trillion rupiah
targeted, the ministry said in a statement on its website. A
total of 11.43 trillion rupiah of bids were received.  Ten-year bonds declined for a fourth day. The yield on
Indonesia’s 8.25 percent notes due July 2021 climbed one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.71 percent, according to
the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
