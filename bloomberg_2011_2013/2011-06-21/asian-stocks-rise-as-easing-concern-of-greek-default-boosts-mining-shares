Asian stocks rose for the first day
in five as concern eased that Greece will default after
Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , leader of euro-area finance
ministers, indicated a solution to the crisis will be found.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company with
almost a fifth of its sales in Europe, climbed 1.6 percent in
Sydney as crude prices advanced. Nissan Motor Co., the No. 2
Japanese seller of cars in Europe behind  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  in
May, rose 3.1 percent after the yen depreciated.  Foster’s Group
Ltd. (FGL) , Australia’s biggest brewer, jumped 13 percent in Sydney
after rejecting a takeover offer.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.3 percent to 130.6 as
of 4:42 p.m. in Tokyo, set for its biggest increase since May 31,
with almost four times as many stocks advancing as declining.
Close to $750 billion has been wiped off the market value of the
gauge since its high for the year on May 2 through yesterday.  “The whole market is oversold and hence the bounce on a
hint that one of the issues weighing on the market may be close
to a resolution,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about
$1.7 billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney.
“Greece is arguably the biggest of these issues because of its
ability to cause severe damage to markets.”  ‘Undervalued’ Banks  The Asia-Pacific index lost 1.9 percent last week,
completing its seventh straight decline, the longest such run
since 2004. Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 13.2
times estimated earnings on June 16, the lowest since April 20,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 1.1 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 1.3 percent and  Hong Kong ’s
Hang Seng Index rose 1.2 percent.  South  Korea ’s Kospi Index gained 1.4 percent, paced by
lenders after Daewoo Securities Co. said in a report today that
loan growth in the nation may improve in the second half and
that bank stocks were “undervalued.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.5
percent today. In  New York  yesterday, the index advanced 0.5
percent to 1,278.36.  Juncker, head of the euro-region finance ministers group,
said yesterday Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  assured
him the government would do everything necessary to ensure
delivery of financial aid from the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund .  Austerity Measures  Papandreou faces a confidence vote in his parliament today
that may determine whether  Greece  becomes the first euro-area
country to default. European Union leaders have insisted Greece
secure multi-party support for austerity measures that are a
condition of the aid needed to avoid default as soon as next
month.  “Greece will be supported by European nations in the
end,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at
Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. “We’re going to avoid a
worst-case scenario.”  BHP Billiton  climbed 1.6 percent to A$42 in Sydney. Rio
Tinto Group, a mining company that gets about 14 percent of its
revenue from Europe, gained 1.7 percent to A$78.64. PetroChina
Co., the mainland’s biggest oil producer, advanced 1.8 percent
in to HK$11.08 in Hong Kong.  Crude oil for July delivery increased 0.3 percent to settle
in New York yesterday, and rose as much as 1.1 percent today
before paring gains ahead of the confidence vote in Greece and a
two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve that begins today in
 Washington .  QE2 Exit  The Fed has said it will complete $600 billion in bond
purchases, known as QE2 for the second round of quantitative
easing, by the end of this month. More than three quarters of 58
economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
to keep the Fed balance sheet at current levels until October or
later, compared with about half who held that view before the
Fed’s last policy meeting in April.  Honda Motor Co., the world’s fourth-largest automaker by
market value, advanced 1.1 percent to 2,928 yen in Tokyo after
the weakening yen boosted Japanese exporters’ earnings prospects.
Toyota, the world’s No. 1 carmaker, gained 0.9 percent to 3,205
yen. Nissan gained 3.1 percent to 820 yen after Daiwa Securities
Capital markets raised the rating on the company’s stock to
“buy.”  TDK Corp., an electronics manufacturer that gets about 15
percent of its revenue from  Europe , gained 3.3 percent to 4,485
yen.  The yen depreciated to 115.08 against the euro, after
reaching 115.35, the least since June 16, and compared with
114.80 in New York yesterday. A weaker yen boosts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  Relative Valuations  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 6.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 1.7 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 3.6 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times for the S&P 500
and 10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  Foster’s jumped 13 percent to A$5.14 in Sydney. Australia’s
biggest brewer rejected an unsolicited A$9.5 billion ($10
billion) conditional cash takeover offer from  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  as
too low.  The non-binding approach, at A$4.90 a share,
“significantly undervalues” the company for a change of
control, and Foster’s won’t take further action on it, the
Melbourne-based brewer said in a statement. The offer is 8.2
percent higher than yesterday’s closing price.  Korean Banks  In  Seoul ,  KB Financial Group Inc. (105560) , owner of South Korea’s
largest bank, rose 5.4 percent to 51,000 won after Daewoo
Securities said loan growth will improve. Shinhan Financial
Group Co. added 4.4 percent to 50,800 won.  Industrial Bank of
Korea (024110) , which lends to small-and medium-sized companies, advanced
4.3 percent to 20,550 won.  Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Co., a shipyard,
climbed 4.7 percent to 30,250 won after Daewoo raised the stock
to “buy” from “trading buy,” saying earnings and orders were
likely to improve in the second half.  Among other stocks that advanced today, Aeon Co. jumped 3.8
percent to 931 yen in  Tokyo  after the Nikkei newspaper said
profit for the retailer increased by 30 percent in the three
months through May.  Kubota Corp., a maker of  farm equipment  that delayed
earnings forecasts because of damage from Japan’s worst
earthquake in March, advanced 2.9 percent to 681 yen after
saying full-year net income will rise 9.4 percent.  In Hong Kong, Hengan International Group Co., a
manufacturer of personal hygiene products, climbed 1.8 percent
to HK$69.10 after Yuanta Financial Holding Co. rated the stock
“buy” in new coverage.  To contact the reporters on this story:
