The share of North Sea Buzzard crude
in the Forties oil blend fell to 21 percent last week from 25
percent in the period to June 12, according to  BP Plc. (BP/)   Daily Forties production is forecast to increase to 461,000
barrels in September from 399,000 barrels in August, BP said in
a posting today on its website. The company operates the Forties
Pipeline System.  Oil from Buzzard, the biggest in the Forties blend, will
account for 25 percent of total production in September,
compared with 40 percent a month earlier, BP said.  Forties is one of the grades that determine the price of
