BP Plc may invest $15 billion over
10 years to develop the Block 61 tight gas fields,  Oil & Gas
Journal  reported, citing the vice-president of BP Oman.  About $10 billion will be spent on drilling wells and the
rest on surface facilities, Jonathan Edwards said, according to
the publication. The company will submit a field development
plan to the government early next year, which includes a 1.2
billion cubic-feet-a-day gas processing plant and production
will start by early 2017, Edwards was cited as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
