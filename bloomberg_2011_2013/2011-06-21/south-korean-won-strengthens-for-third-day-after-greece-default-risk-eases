South Korea ’s won advanced the most
in almost one month and government bonds dropped as concern
eased that Greece will default on its debt after Luxembourg’s
Jean-Claude Juncker assured investors a solution will be found.  Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers,
said Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  had assured him the
government would take steps needed to obtain financial aid from
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  “Market nervousness over Greece’s debt issue retreated a
bit over Juncker’s comments, pushing up stocks and the
currency,” said Jeong Mi Young, a currency analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc. in Seoul. “Still, the market is likely to see ups
and downs depending on developments.”  The won climbed 0.6 percent to 1,078.73 per dollar at the 3
p.m. close in  Seoul , the biggest gain since May 26, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. South Korea’s main Kospi index rose
1.4 percent, climbing the most since May 31.  The yield on the 4 percent government bonds due March 2016
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.95
percent, according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
