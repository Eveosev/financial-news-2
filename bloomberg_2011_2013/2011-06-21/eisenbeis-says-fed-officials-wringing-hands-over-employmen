Federal Reserve officials meeting in
 Washington  today and tomorrow are “wringing their hands” over
the U.S. employment situation and are “awfully gun-shy” about
undertaking a third round of quantitative easing, said Robert Eisenbeis, chief monetary economist at Cumberland Advisors Inc.
in Sarasota,  Florida .  “Shrinking that balance sheet when you’re loaded up with
the kind of assets they’re loaded up with won’t be easy,” he
said in an interview today on the Bloomberg Radio program, the
“Hays Advantage” with  Kathleen Hays . “The more they engage in
these purchases, the harder the exit will be.”  “When you’ve dug yourself into a hole, the first thing you
do is stop digging,” Eisenbeis said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
