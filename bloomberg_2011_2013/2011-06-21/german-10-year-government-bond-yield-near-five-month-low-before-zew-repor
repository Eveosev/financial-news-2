German 10-year government bond
yields were near their lowest level since January before a
report economists said may show investor confidence fell,
strengthening the case for  interest rates  to be left unchanged.  The two-year yield snapped two days of increases. The ZEW
Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim will say its
index of investor and analyst expectations fell to minus 3 in
June from 3.1 in May, according to the median prediction of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Greek bonds declined.  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 2.97 percent
as of 8:11 a.m. in  London . It reached 2.91 percent on June 16,
the lowest level since Jan. 11. The 3.25 percent security due
July 2021 fell 0.020 or 20 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,435)
face amount, to 102.410. Yields on two-year notes were at 1.52
percent. They dropped to 1.43 percent last week, the least since
Feb. 22.  German  government bonds  have returned 0.3 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
gained 3.3 percent. Spanish debt has gained 1.7 percent, while
Greek securities lost 19 percent, the indexes show.  The 10-year Greek yield increased 15 basis points to 17.49
percent, while that on the two-year security was 20 basis points
higher at 28.81 percent. The two-year yield increased to 30
percent last week for the first time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
