What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 1 cent a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that warm,
dry weather next week will increase the risk of damage to crops
in  Argentina , while weekend rains will fail to alleviate stress
on fields in southern  Brazil ,  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT on speculation that adverse weather in  South America 
will limit output and lift overseas demand for U.S. supplies,
Roose said.  Soybean-oil  futures are expected to open 0.15 cent
to 0.25 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open
steady to $1 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that a 21 percent drop in prices
this year will boost global food and animal-feed demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
