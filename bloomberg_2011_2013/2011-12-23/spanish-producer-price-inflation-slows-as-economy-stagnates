Spanish  producer-price  inflation
slowed for a second month in November after the economy stalled.  Prices  of goods leaving factories, mines and refineries
rose 6.3 percent from a year earlier, after increasing 6.5
percent in October, the  National Statistics Institute  in Madrid
said today. Prices rose 0.2 percent on the month.  Spain ’s  economy  stagnated in the third quarter and the Bank
of Spain estimates activity contracted in the last three months
of the year as unemployment reached almost 23 percent. Crude  oil
prices  rose 19 percent in the 12 months to end of November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
