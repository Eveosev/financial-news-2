(Corrects total to million from billion in second
paragraph.)  The  European Central Bank  bought
fewer bonds this week after a record liquidity injection
designed to keep bank credit flowing.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it settled 19 million euros
($24.7 million) of bond purchases, compared with 3.36 billion
euros last week. The central bank announced the purchases early
because of the Christmas holidays. They are normally published
on a Monday. The ECB will take seven-day term deposits on Dec.
27 to absorb the 211 billion euros of liquidity created since
its  bond program  started on May 10 last year, a practice it
employs to ensure the purchases don’t fuel inflation.  The institution loaned banks a record 489 billion euros for
three years on Dec. 21 to avert a credit crunch from the
sovereign debt crisis. Growth prospects in  Europe  have worsened
since September, U.K. central bank Governor Mervyn King said
yesterday after a  risk assessment  by regional officials. The ECB
cut its 2012 euro-area growth forecast this month to 0.3
percent.  ECB officials have resisted calls from investors and
governments to backstop the currency bloc and combat the turmoil
by boosting bond purchases. The ECB says it’s up to governments
to solve the crisis, and asking the central bank to rescue
states would damage its independence and credibility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
