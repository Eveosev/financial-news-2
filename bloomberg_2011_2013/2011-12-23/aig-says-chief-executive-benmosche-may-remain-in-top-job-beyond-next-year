American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche , who’s been treated for
cancer, may stay in the top job longer than previously planned.  Benmosche, 67, has said he’d like to remain CEO past next
year, according to an e-mailed statement today from Mark Herr, a
spokesman for the New York-based insurer. Benmosche took the CEO
post in 2009 and had previously said he planned to complete
three years on the job.  “He has said he would like to, health-willing, continue to
lead AIG past 2012,” Herr said. The Wall Street Journal
reported earlier on Benmosche’s plans.  Benmosche said in an interview earlier this year that his
health was “OK” and he continued to exercise. AIG said last
year that Chairman  Steve Miller  is available to be CEO if
Benmosche stepped down before a permanent successor is named.  AIG received a government bailout in 2008 that swelled to
$182.3 billion. It repaid the remaining $21 billion on its Fed
credit line in January and has a stake in Fed-controlled
vehicles that took over mortgage-related assets after the
bailout. The U.S. Treasury Department holds 77 percent of the
company’s shares and is seeking to wind down the stake.  “I would like to see all the Treasury stocks sold and to
feel comfortable that we have a sustainable organization and
leadership team, that AIG if it hits some new bumps in the road
will not have a problem,” Benmosche said in the April
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
