Austria’s financial regulator took
control of Alizee Bank AG, a specialized lender to solar and
wind-power projects, by assigning a state supervisor charged
with protecting creditors’ interests.  The regulator, FMA, yesterday assigned Dorotea Rebmann as
state supervisor to the bank to “safeguard the financial
interests of creditors and the assets entrusted to the
company,” the agency said in an e-mailed statement today. A
state supervisor is assigned if “there is a risk to the ability
of a credit institution to serve its liabilities to creditors.”  Alizee, based in Vienna, confirmed the appointment in an e-
mailed statement, adding that it didn’t mean the bank lacked
liquidity. Alizee plans to raise fresh capital soon, it said.  The bank had assets of 41 million euros ($53.5 million) at
the end of last year, according to its annual report. Its net
loss widened to 2.25 million euros in 2010, from 1.36 million
euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
