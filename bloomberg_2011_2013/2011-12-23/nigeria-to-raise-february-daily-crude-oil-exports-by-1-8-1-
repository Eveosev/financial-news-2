1.8 percent from January, according to loading plans obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The country will ship 68 cargoes totaling 62.1 million
barrels, or 2.14 million barrels a day. That compares with next
monthâ€™s daily volume of 2.1 million barrels.  The country will export 11 shipments of Qua Iboe grade,
seven Agbami, six Forcados, six Brass River, five  Bonny Light ,
five Bonga, five Akpo, four Erha, four Escravos, three Amenam,
three Yoho, two EA, two Okono, two Antan, one Okwori, one Abo
and one Pennington in February, the plans showed. No Oso
condensate will be exported. Cargo sizes range from 90,000
barrels to 1 million barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
