An Israeli lawmaker called for a
parliamentary investigation into how Internet-monitoring
equipment made by an Israeli company was shipped to  Iran .  Nachman Shai, a member of the opposition Kadima Party, said
he will ask the  Foreign Affairs  and Defense Committee this week
to follow up on a Bloomberg News report that the NetEnforcer
product made by Hod Hasharon, Israel-based  Allot Communications
Ltd.  was sold through a Danish company to a buyer in Iran.  Allot shares fell 5.1 percent to $15.84 at 11:04 a.m. in
 New York , after earlier plunging as much as 13 percent.  A strict Israeli ban prohibits “trading with the enemy,”
including any shipments to Iran. Israeli trade, customs and
defense officials say their departments were unaware of the
sales.  The Israeli Defense Ministry issued an e-mailed statement,
saying it “has started to examine the report and will decide
how to act according to the information and details that it
collects.”  “It’s clear that the right hand doesn’t know what the
left hand was doing,” Shai said in a telephone interview. “The
Knesset must investigate how such important information slipped
under the radar of the  Defense Ministry .”  NetEnforcer conducts “deep-packet inspection” of networks.
While the technology has commercial uses, such as managing
network traffic, packet inspection also has been used by
countries, including  Tunisia , for snooping into e-mail contents
of citizens, Bloomberg News found.  Allot officials said they authorized no sales to Iran and
are looking into it.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
