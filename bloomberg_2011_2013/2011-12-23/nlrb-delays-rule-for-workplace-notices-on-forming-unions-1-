The  National Labor Relations Board 
said it will postpone for three months requiring U.S. employers
to notify workers of their rights to form a union, allowing time
to resolve legal challenges.  U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson asked the board at a
court hearing on Dec. 19 for a delay after groups led by the
National Association of Manufacturers and National Federation of
Independent Businesses said the NLRB lacked the power to require
union-organizing posters in the workplace.  Pushing the effective date to April 30 from Jan. 31 “would
facilitate the resolution of the legal challenges,” the NLRB
said today in a  statement .  The NLRB, which investigates unfair labor practices, in
August ordered employers to display notices informing workers
about their rights to form a union and bargain on contracts.
Such signs must be in the same place as posters about personnel
rules or policies.  The NLRB said the  National Labor Relations Act  gives it the
authority to pursue new workplace rules such as the proposed
requirement.  The case is National Association of Manufacturers v.
National Labor Relations Board, 1:11-cv-1629, U.S. District
Court,  District of Columbia  ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
