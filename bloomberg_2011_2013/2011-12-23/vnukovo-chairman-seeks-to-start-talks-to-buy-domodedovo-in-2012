Vitaly Vantsev, Chairman of Vnukovo
International Airport, plans to start talks on buying
Domodedovo,  Russia ’s largest airport, after the country’s
January holidays.  “We are considering buying Domodedovo with partners,”
Vantsev said on the phone yesterday. He said he had received no
offer and learned about the sale from the press. The Vedomosti
newspaper reported yesterday that Domodedovo had hired Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to act as an adviser on the sale.  Vantsev valued the airport at $3 billion, citing his
experience. Vnukovo is Moscow’s third-largest airport, after
Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo. The airport’s owners are seeking
about $5 billion for the asset, Interfax reported today.  “We will look for financial partners if we enter into a
deal,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
