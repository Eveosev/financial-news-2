Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  and  Erste Group
Bank AG (RBAG)  climbed for at least a fourth day, leading Czech shares
higher on optimism that the U.S. economy is recovering and
European Central Bank loans will prevent a euro-area recession.  The  PX (PX)  gauge climbed 0.8 percent to 898.6 at its close in
Prague as Komercni,  Societe Generale SA (GLE) ’s Czech unit, gained 1.7
percent and Austria’s Erste rose 3 percent. The index has lost
27 percent in 2011, set for the second-biggest slide in the
bourse’s 16-year history, after a 53 percent drop in 2008.  Global shares rose for a fourth day and the dollar weakened
as a U.S. report showed orders for durable goods in the world’s
largest economy jumped in November, after data yesterday showed
jobless claims fell. The ECB two days ago offered a record
amount in three-year loans to cash-strapped lenders in the euro
area, the main market for Czech exports.  “The end of the year could be fairly positive after all
for the assets in our region” because of “several pieces of
positive news from both sides of the Atlantic,” analysts Jan Cermak and Jan Bures at CSOB AS in  Prague  wrote in a report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
