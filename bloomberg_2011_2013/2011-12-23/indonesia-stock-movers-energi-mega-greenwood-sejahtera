Shares of the following companies
had  unusual (JCI)  moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The Jakarta Composite Index climbed less than 0.1 percent
to 3,797.15. The gauge increased 0.8 percent this week and has
gained 2.5 percent this year. The market will be closed on Dec.
26 for a public holiday.  Palm oil  producers:  PT Astra Agro Lestari (AALI)  , the
nation’s biggest plantation stock by market value, advanced 0.7
percent to 21,250 rupiah, the highest close since Dec. 12.  PT
Perusahaan Perkebunan London Sumatra Indonesia (LSIP)  , the
third-largest, increased 1.1 percent to 2,250 rupiah.  Palm oil climbed to the highest level in more than two
weeks on concern that rains in Malaysia, the second-largest
grower after  Indonesia , may affect harvesting and curb
production. The March-delivery contract rose as much as 2.1
percent to 3,162 ringgit ($1,002) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange.  PT Energi Mega Persada (ENRG)  , Indonesia’s second-
biggest listed oil company, declined 2.3 percent to 173 rupiah
amid speculation its two-day, 13 percent jump this week was
excessive, according to Ivan Kurniawan, an analyst at PT First
Asia Capital in Jakarta. Energi Mega’s relative-strength index,
a moving average based on how rapidly prices have advanced or
dropped, was 68 yesterday. A reading of 70 suggests to some
investors the stock is poised to fall.  PT Greenwood Sejahtera  (GWSA IJ), the property developer,
sank 18 percent to 205 rupiah on its trading debut. The company
raised 400 billion rupiah ($44 million) in an initial public
offering to acquire land for its projects. Short-term investors
hoping to realize gains on the first trading day sold the stock
after seeing demand was weak, said Edwin Sinaga, president
director at PT FinanCorpindo Nusa, a Jakarta-based brokerage.  To contact the reporters on this story:
