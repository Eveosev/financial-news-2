Gulf Coast gasoline rose against
futures after power failed at  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ) ’s Krotz
Springs refinery in Louisiana and a compressor tripped offline
at  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Beaumont site in Texas.  There was “limited production impact” from the  power
failure  at Krotz Springs, which was caused by the weather, and
the refinery restarted, Blake Lewis, an outside spokesman for
Alon with Lewis Public Relations in Dallas, said in an e-mail.  The compressor at Beaumont restarted after flaring from the
fluid catalytic cracker, according to a filing with state
regulators.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in  the
Gulf Coast market  narrowed 0.75 cent to 5.5 cents versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:02 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
2.88 cents to $2.6061 a gallon.  Nymex gasoline, heating oil and natural gas contracts
closer early today at 1:30 p.m. New York time. This applies to
both floor and electronic trading.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New York Harbor widened
its premium by 0.12 cent to 2.25 cents a gallon against futures,
the biggest margin since Nov. 10. Prompt delivery rose 0.37 cent
to $2.6648.  To contact the reporter on this story:
