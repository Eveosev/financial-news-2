Ethanol futures rose a sixth day in
 Chicago  amid optimism the  U.S. economy  is improving and will
lead to more fuel consumption.  Prices followed crude oil and gasoline higher a day after a
U.S. Labor Department report showed  initial jobless claims  fell
to the lowest level since April 2008 and Commerce Department
data released today showed  orders for equipment  meant to last
for at least three years climbed 3.8 percent last month.  “We just followed suit,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “It’s
commodities in general. Everything was pretty much up.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery added 1.2 cents, or
0.6 percent, to settle at $2.185 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the sixth consecutive gain and the longest such streak
since Nov. 3. Futures have fallen 8.1 percent this year and are
headed for the first yearly decline since 2008.  In cash market trading ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.325 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive
gained 5.5 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $2.275, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  rose 5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.335
a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel added 2 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.225.  Crude oil for February delivery rose 15 cents to $99.68 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Dec. 13. Futures have climbed 9.1 percent this
year after increasing 15 percent in 2010.  Gasoline for January delivery rose 4.74 cents, or 1.8
percent, to settle at $2.6872 a gallon in New York, the highest
settlement price since Nov. 8. The futures are up 9.5 percent
this year, after gaining 20 percent a year ago and doubling in
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
