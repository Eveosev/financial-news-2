India ’s gasoline sales dropped in
November as consumers purchased less of the motor fuel, opting
for cheaper diesel.  Gasoline sales dropped 7 percent from October to 1.2
million metric tons, or about 330,000 barrels a day, last month
and diesel rose 6.8 percent to 5.7 million over the same period,
according to data on oil ministry data and those compiled by
 Bloomberg . Gasoline is 60 percent more expensive than diesel
sold in New Delhi compared with 48 percent on Jan. 1.  The  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers  may cut its
annual domestic passenger-car sales target as higher borrowing
costs and fuel prices sap demand, the group said Dec. 8. Sales
fell for four straight months till October before rising 7
percent in November. The federal government allows state-run
refiners to sell gasoline at market linked prices while it
control diesel rates to help curb  inflation  that has stayed
above 9 percent every month this year.  The nation’s refineries imported 14.8 million tons of
crude, or about 3.6 million barrels a day, in November,
according to the oil ministry data. That’s 17 percent higher
than the previous month, the ministry figures showed. Liquefied
petroleum gas purchases from overseas were 369,000 tons and
9,000 tons of diesel last month, according to the data.  Fuel exports including gasoline, diesel and naphtha were
4.9 million tons. Motor fuel shipments increased 6.4 percent to
1.1 million with diesel cargoes falling for a second month to
1.7 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
