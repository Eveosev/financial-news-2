The U.S. and partner nations have
agreed to increase their ability to deal with biological weapons
attacks and mass outbreaks of disease.  The decision, made at the close of the seventh Review
Conference of Biological and Toxin Weapons in Geneva, was part
of a larger program that the 165 member nations agreed to pursue
until their next meeting in five years, said Thomas Countryman,
the assistant secretary of state for international security and
nonproliferation.  Countries also committed to strengthening implementation of
the convention. Now, only about half of the signatory countries
submit an annual report on their biological activities, as the
agreement calls for, Countryman said in a telephone briefing.  Two U.S. aims -- to increase the three-person staff that
administers the convention and to allow the conference to make
decisions in the five years between formal meetings -- failed
due to objections from some members. The conference is governed
by consensus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
