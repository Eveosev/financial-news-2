Argentina ’s Senate last night
approved a bill that limits the purchase of farmland by
foreigners, newspaper Clarin reported.  Senators voted 62-1 in favor of the bill, which was already
approved by the lower house, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper
said. According to the bill, foreigners can buy as much as 15
percent of the country’s rural areas, Clarin said.  The bill also restricts individual foreign ownership of
farmland to 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres), the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
