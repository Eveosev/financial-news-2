Kenya ’s shilling was unchanged,
snapping two days of declines. The Tanzanian shilling weakened
as businesses stockpile dollars on expectations the U.S.
currency may become more expensive after the holiday break.  The Kenyan shilling, currency of  East Africa ’s biggest
economy, has been the best performer among more than 170
currencies on Bloomberg in the second half of this year, gaining
6.8 percent against the dollar. Kenya’s currency has weakened
3.5 percent for the year, and was steady at 83.65 per dollar at
1:56 p.m. in Nairobi.  Tanzania’s shilling depreciated by 0.2 percent to 1,590 per
dollar at 1:54 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital.  “Commercial banks are demanding dollars to secure their
position ahead of the Christmas holiday which caused the
shilling to depreciate,” Fred Siwale, a trader with CRDB Bank
Plc, said today by phone from  Dar es Salaam .  Uganda ’s currency slumped for the third day, the longest
losing streak in four weeks, retreating 1.2 percent to 2,449.50
by 1:55 p.m. in Kampala, the capital.  To contact the reporters on this story:
