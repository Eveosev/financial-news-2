Canada ’s currency touched its
strongest level in more than a week versus the dollar after
reports showed the economic recovery gaining momentum in the
U.S., the nation’s largest trading partner.  The Canadian dollar gained for a fourth consecutive day as
a report showed the nation’s gross domestic product grew by less
than 0.1 percent in October. U.S. durable-goods orders rose the
most in four months in November, after data yesterday showed a
drop in jobless-benefit claims. Crude oil posted its biggest
weekly gain in almost two months and global equity prices rose.  “The  U.S. economy  is looking a bit more resilient even
though it’s growing at moderate levels,” said Eric Viloria,
senior currency strategist for Gain Capital Group LLC in  New
York . “The Canadian dollar is responding more to the overall
risk environment.”  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, was little
changed at C$1.0203 at 5 p.m. Toronto time, after earlier
reaching C$1.0181, the strongest level since Dec. 12. One
Canadian dollar buys 98.01 U.S. cents.  The currency posted its biggest five-day gain in three
weeks. It has fallen 2.2 percent this year versus its U.S.
counterpart.  Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the
 two-year  benchmark up two basis points, 0.02 percentage point,
to 0.92 percent. It reached 0.94 percent, the highest since Dec.
2. The 1 percent security fell four cents to C$100.17.  Stocks Correlation  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  rose 0.9 percent and the S&P/TSX
 Composite Index  gaining 0.4 percent. Crude oil, Canada’s largest
export, rose 0.4 percent to $99.889 a barrel and 6.5 percent on
the week.  Movements in the Canadian dollar have been increasingly
tied to equities. The one-month correlation coefficient between
the gauge of U.S. equities and the Canadian dollar reached
0.9348 on Nov. 14, the strongest relationship since Bloomberg
data began in 1992, versus an average since then of 0.2426. A
reading of 1 indicates the measures move in lockstep. The
reading was 0.853 today.  Real GDP  increased less than 0.1 percent on a seasonally
adjusted basis,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa.
Economists forecast a 0.1 percent gain, based on the median
estimate of a Bloomberg survey with 23 responses. Output had
increased for four months before October, with a gain of 0.2
percent in September.  ‘Less Tarnished’  “In terms of regional growth, the fact that  North America 
is the less tarnished button is supportive,” said  Stewart Hall ,
senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto.
“There is some room that you see Canada be one of the better
performing currencies in 2012 based on those broad themes.”  The nation’s federal budget deficit dropped by 46 percent
in October as corporate income-tax revenue surged, the finance
department said. The deficit in the first seven months of the
fiscal year that began April 1 shrank to C$15.4 billion from
C$21.5 billion.  The loonie is down 1.7 percent this year for the worst
performance in Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes after the
Swedish krona. The yen has appreciated the most at 3.7 percent,
followed by the  U.S. dollar  at 1.1 percent in the gauge of 10
developed-nation currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
