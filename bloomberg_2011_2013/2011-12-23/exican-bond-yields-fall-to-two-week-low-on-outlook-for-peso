Yields on benchmark Mexican local
bonds fell to a two-week low as the outlook for a less volatile
currency fueled appetite for the securities.  The yield on  Mexico ’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
6.55 percent at the close in Mexico City, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price of the security rose 0.45
centavo to 130.13 centavos per peso. The peso climbed 0.1
percent to 13.8198 per  U.S. dollar , from 13.8272 yesterday.  Mexico’s currency-exchange commission said Nov. 29 the
central bank will auction $400 million of its reserves daily to
arrest a slide in the peso, which has tumbled 11 percent this
year. Three-month implied volatility on peso options, which
reflects investors’ expectations for currency fluctuations,
declined to 16.8 percent today from 20.2 percent before the
measures were introduced.  “There was a fair amount of premium priced in because of
the volatility which was coming from the  Mexican peso ,” Ram Bala Chandran, a Latin American currency and rates strategist at
Citigroup, said in a telephone interview from  New York .  The peso’s slide in 2011 is the biggest among Latin
America’s major currencies. The central bank said it didn’t sell
dollars or receive offers in the three auctions it held today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
