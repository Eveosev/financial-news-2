Gold climbed and was set for the
first weekly gain in three after better-than-expected U.S.
economic data damped demand for the dollar as a haven investment.  Cash bullion snapped two days of losses to rise as much as
0.5 percent to $1,614.05 an ounce. It was at $1,611.45 at 12:48
p.m. in  Singapore , up 0.8 percent this week. The February-
delivery contract climbed 0.2 percent to $1,613.50 on the Comex.  “While the U.S. is beginning to show signs of economic
recovery, it’s still too soon to talk about growth there,” said
Ye Yanwu, head of research at Everbright Futures Co. “At the
same time, Europe continues to be mired in debt, and this will
likely keep demand for the dollar strong and weigh on gold.”  The number of applications for U.S. unemployment benefits
fell last week to the lowest since 2008 and confidence among U.S.
consumers rose in December, reports showed yesterday, sending
the dollar lower.  Mervyn King , vice chairman of the European
Systemic Risk Board, said  Europe ’s crisis may hurt the real
economy and the outlook for financial stability has worsened.  Gold has rallied 13 percent this year, touching a record
$1,921.15 on Sept. 6, as investors sought to hedge against
market turmoil. Prices fell 6.6 percent last week, and touched
$1,560.97 on Dec. 15, the lowest price since Sept. 26, after the
 Federal Reserve  refrained from taking new action to boost growth.  Fund Holdings  Holdings in  exchange-traded funds , which reached a record
2,360.810 metric tons on Dec. 14, fell for a sixth day to a one-
month low of 2,321.158 tons yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the worst run since September.  Gold “is consolidating after the recent big slide,” Ye
said from  Shanghai . “Once the crisis in Europe shows fresh
signs of deterioration, we’ll see investors come back.”  Spot silver gained for the first day in three, climbing as
much as 0.9 percent to $29.335 an ounce. The metal, which has
retreated 5.1 percent in 2011, last traded at $29.33 an ounce
and is 1.4 percent lower this week.  Cash platinum rose for the first time in three days,
gaining 0.3 percent to $1,427 an ounce, down 19 percent for the
year. Cash palladium advanced for a fourth day, rising 0.5
percent to $655 an ounce, trimming the year’s loss to 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
