The Exxon Mobil Corp.-led group
developing the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas deposit won approval from
 Russia  to spend $2.9 billion on the project next year, Interfax
reported, citing an Energy Ministry official it didn’t identify.  The approved budget was little changed from Exxon’s
proposal, the news service said, citing the official. The
Russian state awards tax breaks based on companies’ level of
investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
