The U.S. hog-breeding herd on Dec.
1 was 0.4 percent larger than a year earlier, the government
said, as the outlook for producer profits improved.  About 5.803 million  sows  were being held back for breeding
at the start of the month, up from 5.778 million a year
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
quarterly report. Eleven analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast a 0.7 percent gain, on average. The breeding herd fell
from 5.806 million at the end of the previous quarter.  Producers made an average profit of $12.94 per animal sold
in 2010 and $6.40 this year, said  Rich Nelson , the director of
research at McHenry, Illinois-based Allendale Inc. Profit of
$6.80 a head is expected for 2012, based on closing futures on
Dec. 21, he said. Sow slaughter was almost 3 percent higher
from September through November than in the same period in
2010, Nelson said. That was offset by the addition of young
females, or gilts, to the breeding herd, he said.  “We’ve got two years of clear profits in the pork-
production sector, 2010 and 2011,” Nelson said in a telephone
interview before the report. “Based on current futures for
both hogs and feed prices, 2012 is going to be lined up for
another clear profit year as well.”  Hog futures climbed 6 percent this year before today,
reaching $1.0435 a pound on April 1, the highest since at least
1986. Wholesale- pork  prices, up 11 percent in 2011, reached
$1.1019 a pound on Aug. 8, the highest since at least October
1997, USDA data show. Before today, the price of corn, the main
ingredient in livestock feed, slumped 23 percent since touching
a record in June.  Hog Herd Grows  The total hog herd was 1.5 percent bigger on Dec. 1 at
65.931 million animals, compared with 64.925 million a year
earlier, the USDA said. Analysts expected a 1.2 percent gain.  “The message here is that a fresh crop of new, highly
productive gilts is now in the breeding herd,” Nelson said.
“That will keep pigs-per-litter numbers at this very strong
pace and add an extra 2 percent to pork production” next year,
he said.  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.6 percent to
85.05 cents a pound at 10:51 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.  The inventory of hogs to be sold for slaughter was 60.128
million, up 1.7 percent from 59.147 million a year earlier, the
USDA said. Analysts expected a 1.2 percent increase.  Sows averaged a record 10.02 pigs per litter during the
three months ended Nov. 30, up from 9.89 in the same period a
year earlier, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
