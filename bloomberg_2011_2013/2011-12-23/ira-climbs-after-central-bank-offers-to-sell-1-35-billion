The lira weakened for a third day
against the dollar after the central bank sold a fraction of
what it offered in a currency auction.  The currency depreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 1.901,
near the record low of 1.9056 reached on Dec. 19, before paring
its loss to 1.8987 as of 4.22 p.m. The central bank sold $50
million today after offering as much as $1.35 billion and
receiving bids worth $1 billion. Yesterday it sold $50 million
after putting on offer $150 million. On Dec. 20 and 21, the bank
sold what it offered, $350 million.  “The central bank is making a mistake,” Burcin Metin,
chief currency trader at ING Bank AS in Istanbul, wrote in e-
mailed comments. Its “policy of creating uncertainty” will
lead to “sharper fluctuations” in the lira, Metin said.  The central bank has sold about $10.6 billion since August
to shore up the lira, which has depreciated 19 percent this year
in the worst performance among more than 20 currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  Turkey ’s foreign-exchange reserves declined to
$82.7 billion as of Dec. 16, down from $84.4 billion in the
previous week, data from the bank showed today.  Yields  on two-year Turkish benchmark debt fell three basis
points, 0.03 percentage point, to 10.43 percent, a Royal Bank of
Scotland securities index showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
