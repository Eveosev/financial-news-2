SkyePharma Plc (SKP)  fell as much as 18
percent in London trading after saying the regulatory review of
asthma treatment Flutiform was referred to the European
Medicines Agency for arbitration.  The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use
will make a decision on Flutiform by a majority vote, the
London-based company said today in a statement. The arbitration
process is initiated when a unanimous decision can’t be reached
on a marketing authorization under the so-called decentralized
procedure, SkyePharma said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
