(Corrects headline.)  The FBI will find it “challenging”
to deploy a long-delayed new computer system for managing cases
by May 2012, according to a report by the U.S. Justice
Department’s inspector general.  The case management system, called Sentinel, experienced
two outages and the hardware infrastructure was deemed
“inadequate” during an Oct. 6 testing exercise, according to
the report released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
