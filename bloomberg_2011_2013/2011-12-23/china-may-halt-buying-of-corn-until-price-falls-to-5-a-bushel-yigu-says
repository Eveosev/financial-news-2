China , the second-biggest corn
consumer, may import more of the grain if global prices fall 19
percent to about $5 a bushel, a level that is significantly
below domestic prices, said Yigu Information Consulting Ltd.  China’s corn supply is sufficient after a record harvest
and the government may import to boost stockpiles only if there
is a “clear price advantage,” said  Feng Lichen , general
manager of Yigu, China’s largest corn information portal.  Corn, used as an ingredient in feed and in ethanol, has
plunged 20 percent since Aug. 31 on high global grain supplies
and concerns that  Europe ’s deepening debt crisis and a slowing
global economy may sap demand. Morgan Stanley on Dec. 13 lowered
its price forecasts for agricultural commodities including corn
because of rising supplies.  China may get the “best chance for corn at value” if it
imports in February, when  Argentina ’s crops are harvested,  Tim Hannagan , Chicago-based analyst at brokerage PFG Best Inc., said
in an e-mail today. Uncertainty about U.S. planting usually
drives up prices in April, he said.  China last made a big purchase around Oct. 13, when the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  announced sales of 900,000 tons.
With harvests expanding from Argentina to China, prices will
fall as much as 30 percent to $4.305 a bushel in Chicago trading
next year, according to the median of 24 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg News.  ‘No Hurry’  “China’s government isn’t in a hurry,” Yigu’s Feng said
by phone from Dalian Dec. 19. It has over 10 million tons stored
from last year’s domestic harvest, and has ordered 4 million
tons of imports, which are enough to “control the market,”
said Feng.  Corn for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to $6.155 a bushel
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 9:18 a.m. Beijing time. End
users in China would pay about 2,400 yuan ($378) a metric ton
for U.S. corn, said Tommy Xiao, analyst at Shanghai JC
Intelligence Co., citing prices from exporters.  Prices at  Shenzhen  port, a leading indicator for southern
China, were 2,420 yuan a ton on Dec. 21, so imports have no
price advantage, said Xiao. At $5 a bushel, U.S. corn would be
2,100 yuan a ton after arriving in China, Xiao said. Imports are
subject to premiums, freight costs of about $59 a ton currently,
a 13 percent VAT and 1 percent tarrif, according to Xiao.  ‘Weaker Commodity’  Prices in Chicago may average $6.60 a bushel in the
2011-2012 marketing year, down from a previous estimate of
$7.25, according to Morgan Stanley. Corn may be “one of the
weaker commodities in 2012,” partly because of record supplies
from  South America  in the first quarter, Hackett Financial
Advisors said Dec. 2.  Corn prices in China will be “range-bound” between 2,200
yuan and 2,400 yuan a ton in the next few months, Yigu’s Feng
said.  China said Dec. 19 it would buy domestic corn to support
farming. The policy effectively sets a price floor of about
2,200 yuan in Dalian, the price-setting center in China, said
Feng. Shipping to Shenzhen from Dalian is about 40-60 yuan a
ton, according to Shanghai JC.  The upper range of next year’s domestic price depends on
feed demand from the livestock industry and corn processors,
said Feng. The government may allow a gain of 100 yuan to 200
yuan for increased production costs, he said.  Corn prices in Chicago slipped 1.9 percent last week after
the  USDA  on Dec. 9 raised China’s corn output estimate for this
year by about 7 million tons from a previous outlook to a record
192 million tons, in line with China’s official estimate.  It’s “a joke” that the USDA adopted this figure given
China’s limited yield and land, Feng said. Yigu projected 170
million tons, compared with 166 million tons by Shanghai JC and
189.2 million tons by Geneva-based SGS SA.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
