Time for a pop quiz. See if you can spot what's wrong with this sentence from
the Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit last week against former  Fannie
Mae  chief executive officer Daniel Mudd: "Additionally, during the relevant period Mudd was a member of the board of
directors, the audit committee, a regular attendee at the board's risk policy
and capital committee meetings, held regular weekly meetings with his direct
reports the business units, and attended quarterly business unit briefings." Give up? Here's a hint. The SEC made the same mistake again later on in this
sentence of the complaint: "Also, as a member of the audit committee at Fannie Mae and the board of
directors, Mudd participated in final committee and board reviews of Fannie
Mae's Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q during the relevant period prior to
certifying." If you answered that it was an error to say Mudd was on Fannie's  audit
committee , give yourself a gold star. Mudd not only wasn't a member, he couldn't
have been one, under SEC rules and New York Stock Exchange listing  standards .
That's because, as Fannie's  proxy statement  made clear,  he wasn't an
independent director. Rather, as CEO, Mudd was part of Fannie's management,
which the audit committee was responsible for overseeing. An SEC spokesman,  John Nester , confirmed that the statements were in error.
He declined further comment. ( Jonathan Weil  is a Bloomberg View columnist. Read his previous coverage of
