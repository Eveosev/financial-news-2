Evicting protesters from their
encampment around  City Hall  last month cost Los Angeles
taxpayers $2.35 million, officials said today.  The estimate was released by City Administrative Officer
Miguel Santana. The two-month demonstration, an offshoot of the
Occupy Wall Street protest that began in New York on Sept. 17,
was intended to highlight  income inequality  in America.  Hundreds of tents were pitched in City Hall Park until
police forced protesters out on Nov. 30. About 300 people were
arrested. At least $1.7 million of the costs for police
overtime, fencing and other expenses related to the protest will
increase the current budget deficit of $72 million, according to
the report.  The nation’s second-largest city by population closed a
$457 million spending gap earlier this year in part by asking
employees to contribute to their retirement health-care costs
and by cutting back on police overtime pay.  The cost estimate doesn’t include restoration of the park,
previously projected to be about $400,000, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
