President  Barack Obama  signed into
law a $1 trillion bill to fund much of the government through
Sept. 30.  The 1,200-page measure sets spending for 10 Cabinet
departments including  Defense , Education, Treasury, State,
Health and Human Services,  Homeland Security  and Labor.  The new law delays the new energy-efficiency standard for
light bulbs, cuts  Pell grants  that help students from low-income
families go to college, and calls for a 17 percent reduction in
foreign aid administered through the State Departmentâ€™s Agency
for International Development.  Budgets for the Environmental Protection Agency will be cut
by 3 percent, the  Internal Revenue Service  by 2 percent and the
Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, by 6 percent.  Earlier efforts to increase security fees charged to
airline passengers were dropped, as were proposals to cut
federal funding for Planned Parenthood and NPR, the syndicator
of public radio programs.  The Senate passed the bill, 67-32, on Dec. 17 after the
House gave its approval a day earlier by a vote of 296-121.  The bill is H.R. 2055.  To contact the reporter on this story:
