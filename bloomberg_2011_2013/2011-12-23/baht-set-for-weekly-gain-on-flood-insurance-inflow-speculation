Thailand ’s baht was poised for its
first weekly gain in three amid speculation overseas insurance
companies will increase demand for the currency to pay for
claims related to the nation’s worst floods in almost 70 years.  The currency gained today as the  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia-Pacific Index of
shares snapped two weeks of declines. A drop in U.S. jobless
claims to the lowest since April 2008 and an increase in
 consumer confidence  added to signs the world’s biggest economy
is weathering Europe’s debt crisis, brightening the outlook for
 Asia ’s exports.  “Speculation about the fund inflows related to insurance
payments is an underlying support for the baht,” said Kozo
Hasegawa, a trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok.
“More importantly this week, risk sentiment has been quite
stable with no major bad news from  Europe . Europe will continue
to be the main factor to drive the market next week.”  The baht added 0.4 percent from a week ago and 0.1 percent
today to 31.23 per dollar as of 8:17 a.m. in Bangkok, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched a one-week high of
31.18 on Dec. 21. The currency may trade between 31.15 and 31.40
next week, Hasegawa said.  The Southeast Asian currency is still headed for its first
annual decline since 2008, falling 4 percent, as exchange data
show international investors sold $427 million more Thai
equities than they bought.  The yield on the 3.25 percent debt due June 2017 added six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.12 percent this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was
unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
