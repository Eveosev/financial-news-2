Baltimore Ravens wide receiver
Anquan Boldin will miss the final two National Football League
regular-season games after surgery to repair a slight tear in
his knee cartilage, coach John Harbaugh said.  “He will be back for the playoffs, whichever round we have
to play in,” Harbaugh said yesterday after Boldin’s procedure.
“It will be a little tighter if we have to play in the first
round.”  The Ravens (10-4) have clinched a playoff spot and are tied
with the Pittsburgh Steelers atop the American Football
Conference North division heading into this weekend’s games. If
they finish the season with the second-best record in the AFC,
they will get a first-round playoff bye.  Boldin, the team’s leading wide receiver with 887 yards on
57 catches, will be replaced by rookie Torrey Smith and veteran
Lee Evans for the Ravens’ games against Cleveland and
Cincinnati. They will be the first games Boldin has missed in
two years with the team.  “We’ve got two tight ends that are really good, so we’re
going to go out there and still attack and do everything we know
how to do,” quarterback  Joe Flacco  said. “Obviously, we’re
going to miss Anquan, but it’s an opportunity for him to get
better and hopefully he’ll come back strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
