Taiwan will study possible economic-
cooperation agreements with  New Zealand , India and the
Philippines and may hold a workshop with Israel by 2013 on a
feasibility study for a free-trade agreement.  The island, which wants to join the Trans-Pacific
Partnership within 10 years, will also continue free-trade talks
with Singapore, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang
told reporters at a briefing in Taipei today.  Taiwan and its former civil-war foe  China  signed their
first trade deal last year, part of a rapprochement that’s given
Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou room to seek similar accords with
neighbors without irking officials in Beijing. Taiwan’s first
investment accord with  Japan , its second-biggest trading
partner, was signed in September.  “We are a trade-dependent economy, and it’s important to
ensure our companies have free excess to global trade,” Shih
said. He said he is confident the island’s economy will grow 4.3
percent next year, a target set out by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development.  Taiwan’s export-led  economy  expanded 3.42 percent in the
three months through September from a year earlier, the slowest
pace since a 1.21 percent contraction in the third quarter of
2009.  The island’s statistic bureau last month forecasted
Taiwan’s economy will growth 4.19 percent next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
