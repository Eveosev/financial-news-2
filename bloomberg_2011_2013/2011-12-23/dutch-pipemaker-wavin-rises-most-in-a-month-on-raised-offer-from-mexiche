Wavin NV (WAVIN) ,  Europe ’s biggest maker of
plastic pipes for sewers, rose the most in a month after the
company received an improved bid of 508 million euros ($664
million) from Mexico’s  Mexichem SAB .  Wavin gained 22 percent to close at 9.58 euros in
Amsterdam. The shares have fallen 16 percent this year. The
Zwolle, Netherlands-based company will grant Mexichem access to
due diligence information after today’s offer of 10 euros per
share, it said in a statement today.  Mexichem, the Latin American chemical producer which has
bought more than 15 companies since 2007, raised its bid for the
second time. The company had increased its offer to 9 euros a
share from 8.50 euros a share on Dec. 7.  “The end game seems to be approaching,’” Tijs Hollestelle, an Amsterdam-based analyst at ING, said in a report
to investors today. Hollestelle has a “buy” recommendation on
the stock.  Mexichem dropped less than 1 percent to 44.95 pesos in
 Mexico  City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
