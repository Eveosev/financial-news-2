Russian stocks fell, bucking wider
emerging-market gains as foreign fund withdrawals offset rising
prices for oil, the country’s biggest export.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks declined 0.7 percent to
1,376.11 at 6:45 p.m. in Moscow. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index dropped 0.1 percent to 1,394.12.  Foreign investors pulled $413 million out of funds invested
in Russian equities in the week ended Dec. 21, VTB Capital said
in a research note today.  “The approaching winter holiday season damped any increase
in trading activity,” VTB analysts led by Alexey Zabotkin said.
Trading in Russian stocks yesterday in Moscow and  London  was 38
percent and 39 percent lower than the three-day average,
according to  Alfa Bank . The first official working day in Russia
next year will be Jan. 10, while the markets will be open for
trading Jan. 3 to Jan. 6 and Jan. 9.  OAO Uralkali, the world’s largest potash producer, led
declines, falling 3.9 percent to 226.14 rubles, its biggest
decrease in two weeks. The company cut its output target for the
soil nutrient by about 7 percent next year to as little as 10.5
million metric tons.  Federal Grid, Rusal  Federal Grid Co., the state-run power-line operator, fell
3.5 percent to 27.71 kopeks, and United Co. Rusal, the world’s
largest aluminum producer, retreated 2.6 percent to 190.74
rubles.  “Investors will probably wait until next week for the
results of the protest meetings scheduled in  Russia  for
tomorrow,” Konstantin Chernyshev, head of research at UralSib
Capital, said in a note.  Opposition activists won government permission to hold a
rally tomorrow of as many as 50,000 people in central Moscow.
More than 48,000 people have said on Facebook Inc. that they
plans to attend.  Oil headed for its biggest weekly gain in 10 months in  New
York  after U.S. economic reports indicated that growth in the
world’s biggest crude consumer will accelerate.  Crude for February delivery added 34 cents to trade at
$99.87 a barrel in electronic trading at 9:36 a.m. in New York.
Prices are up 6.8 percent this week, the biggest gain since Feb.
25.  OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest crude producer, gained
0.3 percent to 1,639.20 rubles, while OAO Rosneft, the largest,
fell 1.4 percent to 209.61 rubles.  OAO Gazprom, the country’s biggest company, decreased 0.7
percent to 169.74 rubles, valuing the gas producer at about $129
billion.  The ruble strengthened 0.5 percent to 31.21 in its fourth
straight day of gains, marking its first weekly increase in
three.  Russia’s central bank today cut its refinancing rate to 8
percent from 8.25 percent, effective Dec. 26. The overnight
auction-based repurchase rate, the regulator’s main lending
tool, will stay at 5.25 percent and the overnight deposit rate,
used to withdraw cash from the economy, will rise a quarter-
point to 4 percent. The move was “neutral” for monetary
policy, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
