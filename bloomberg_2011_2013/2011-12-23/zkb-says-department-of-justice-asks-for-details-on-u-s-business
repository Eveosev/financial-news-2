Zuercher Kantonalbank , the biggest
of the Swiss publicly owned cantonal banks, said it received a
letter from the  U.S. Department of Justice  on Dec. 20 requesting
information of how the bank used to do business in the U.S.  “The letter was written in a very friendly tone,”
requesting statistical material and other information about the
bank’s U.S. business, ZKB spokesman Urs Ackermann said in a
telephone interview from Zurich today. “It does not involve
handing over client data.”  ZKB said on Sept. 20 it had learnt it was under
investigation by U.S. authorities. The U.S. was previously
requesting information about accounts held by thousands of
Americans in 10 banks including  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  and ZKB,
SonntagsZeitung reported on Sept. 4, citing correspondence
between Michael Ambuehl, the state secretary to the Swiss
finance ministry, and  James Cole , the U.S. deputy attorney
general.  To contact the reporter on this story:
