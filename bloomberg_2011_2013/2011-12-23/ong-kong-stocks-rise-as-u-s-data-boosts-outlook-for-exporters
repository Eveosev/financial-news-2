Hong Kong  stocks (HSI)  rose for the third
time day in four days as a drop in U.S. jobless claims and an
increase in consumer confidence spurred optimism the world’s
biggest economy will sustain demand for Asian exports.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the No. 1 supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
gained 1.3 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s largest offshore energy
explorer, increased 2.9 percent after crude  oil prices  advanced.
China Tianrui Group Cement Co., a maker of cement products,
surged 22 percent on debut. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., China’s
fourth-biggest coal producer, rose 6.6 percent after resuming
trading. The company agreed to buy Australia’s Gloucester Coal

think that the worst is over for 2011 and next year will be
better,” said Francis Lun, managing director at Lyncean
Holdings Ltd. “If you have an economic recovery in the U.S. and
 Europe , it will benefit  Asia  because they are the two biggest
export markets for Asia. The risk is that the recovery may be
short lived.”  The Hang Seng Index fell 19 percent this year as banks and
developers declined on China’s measures to curb inflation and
property prices. Concern Europe will fail to contain its debt
crisis also dragged on shares. Companies in the gauge traded at

gained 4.2 percent to 37.5 Hong Kong cents.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent

after a report showed the number of applications for

month high as Americans began wrapping up their holiday
spending, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan sentiment index. The index of U.S. leading indicators

keep growing in 2012.  In the U.K., economic growth accelerated more than
