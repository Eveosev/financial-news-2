Chile  may experience power outages
in the northern cities of Iquique and Arica this afternoon after
a generation plant suffered failures,  Radio Bio-Bio  reported on
its website, citing Energy Minister Rodrigo Alvarez.  Transmission lines in Chile’s north, which is home to some
of the country’s biggest copper mines, also are operating at
limited capacity, Bio-Bio  reported .  Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi unit
expects the cuts to have no impact on production as it has
backup generation units, company spokeswoman Bernardita
Fernandez said by phone. Carolina Lucaroni, a spokeswoman for
BHP Billiton Ltd’s Escondida copper mine, the world’s largest,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
