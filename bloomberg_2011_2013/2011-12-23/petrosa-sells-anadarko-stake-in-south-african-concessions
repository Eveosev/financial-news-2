(Corrects size of concessions in second paragraph. The
story was originally published on Dec. 23.)  PetroSA, South  Africa ’s state-owned
oil company, sold a stake in blocks 5, 6 and 7 off South
Africa’s west coast to  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , marking the
U.S. producer’s entry into the country.  The concessions in the Orange Basin cover 94,000 square
kilometers (23.2 million acres), PetroSA said in an e-mailed
statement today. Anadarko didn’t disclose the price of the
purchase,  John Christiansen , a spokesman for The Woodlands,
Texas-based company, said in a telephone interview today.  Anadarko said last month that fields off Mozambique in east
Africa may have 15 trillion to 30 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas, compared with an earlier estimate of at least
10 trillion cubic feet. The company also has acreage off the
coast of Kenya, as well as projects off west Africa.  The South African transaction is consistent with Anadarko’s
overall exploration strategy, Christiansen said. The company may
start to acquire seismic data for evaluation in 2013, he said.  “With the success that we’ve had in  Mozambique  and the
acreage that we have offshore Kenya, this fits nicely with that
whole east African program,” Christiansen said.  Anadarko rose 0.7 percent to $76.67 at the close in New
York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
