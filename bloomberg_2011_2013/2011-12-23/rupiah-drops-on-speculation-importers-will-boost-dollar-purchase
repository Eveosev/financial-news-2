Indonesia ’s rupiah fell the most
this month, snapping two days of gains, amid speculation
importers will step up dollar purchases to settle month-end
bills.  Government bonds  rose for a sixth day.  The rupiah earlier touched a one-week high as exchange data
show global funds bought $95 million more Indonesian equities
than they sold this week through yesterday. Investors also added
to their holdings of government debt for the first time in a
week on Dec. 20 after  Fitch Ratings  on Dec. 15 raised the
nation’s long-term foreign and local-currency debt to BBB-, its
lowest investment grade.  “Importer demand for the dollar could be a factor that
will limit the upside for the rupiah,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk,
a Hong Kong-based senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “
‘‘The credit-rating upgrade is a fantastic thing in the long run
for the rupiah and it will boost demand for their bonds and
portfolio investment.’’  The rupiah slumped 0.8 percent, the most since Nov. 28, to
9,140 per dollar as of 3:38 p.m. in Jakarta, taking this week’s
loss to 1.2 percent, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency, which touched 9,013
earlier, the strongest level since Dec. 16, may rise toward
9,000 before the year-end, Kowalczyk said.  The yield on the 8.25 percent debt due July 2021 dropped
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.0331 today,
according to midday prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. The rate fell 25 basis points from a week ago, the
most in three weeks.  Foreign ownership  of the government’s debt rose to 221.8
trillion rupiah ($24.5 billion) from 221.5 trillion rupiah the
previous day, according to data from the ministry of finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
