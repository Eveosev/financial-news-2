Quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  won’t
start tomorrow when his Pittsburgh Steelers host the  St. Louis
Rams .  Charlie Batch, an 11-year National Football League veteran,
will start in his place, Steelers spokesman Nathan LoCascio said
today in an e-mail. Roethlisberger, 29, is listed as
questionable for the game.  A Pro Bowl selection in 2007, Roethlisberger is recovering
from a sprain to left ankle sustained two weeks ago. He didn’t
practice this week after throwing three interceptions in a 20-3
loss at the  San Francisco 49ers  on Dec. 19.  The Steelers (10-4) have clinched a playoff spot and are
battling with the Baltimore Ravens (10-4) for first place in the
American Football Conference North division.  The Rams (2-12) are tied with two other teams for the
fewest wins in the NFL this season. Their starting quarterback.
Sam Bradford, is listed as doubtful for the game because of an
ankle injury.  Batch has thrown 60 touchdown passes and 47 interceptions
in 78 games with the Steelers and  Detroit Lions . He hasn’t
completed either of his two passes this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
