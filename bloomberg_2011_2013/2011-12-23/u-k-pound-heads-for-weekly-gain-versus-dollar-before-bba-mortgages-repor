U.K. 10-year gilt yields fell below
2 percent for the first time after reports showed U.K. services
output fell the most in six months in October and lenders
approved fewer home loans than economists predicted last month.  Two year gilt yields also slid to an all-time low after the
 Office for National Statistics  in London said services, which
account for about three quarters of the U.K. economy, shrank 0.7
percent from September. The median prediction of five economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a fall of 0.1 percent.
Lenders granted 34,738 loans to buy homes, down from a revised
35,196 in October, the London-based British Bankers’ Association
said in a report today. The pound fell against the euro.  “The data was slightly weak all around,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and institutional
treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in London. “Gilt yields are
falling regardless right now although the market was looking for
stronger data to continue the theme of buying sterling.”  The yield on  10-year  gilts was one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, lower at 2.04 percent as of 4:17 p.m.  London 
time, after reaching 1.996 percent, the least since Bloomberg
started tracking the data in 1989. The 3.75 percent securities
due September 2021 rose 0.090, or 90 pence per 1,000-pound
($1,562) face amount, to 114.990.  Two-year  yields were little changed at 0.34 percent, after
reaching a record low of 0.292 percent.  U.K. Growth  Gilts have returned 16 percent this year, including
reinvested interest, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German  government bonds  gained 9 percent and  U.S. Treasuries 
have returned 9.5 percent, the indexes show.  Data yesterday showed the U.K.  economy  grew 0.6 percent in
the third quarter, more than previously estimated.  Bank of
England  policy makers have said the pace of expansion is
unlikely to be repeated and forecast stagnation in the current
three-month period as  Europe ’s debt crisis dents confidence and
curbs demand.  The pound was 0.2 percent weaker at 83.44 pence per euro,
paring its advance this week to 0.6 percent. Sterling
appreciated to 83.03 pence on Dec. 21, the strongest level since
Jan. 12. It declined 0.4 percent to $1.5624 today.  Sterling has advanced 0.7 percent in 2011 against nine
developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The dollar is 1.1 percent stronger, while the euro has
lost 1.4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
