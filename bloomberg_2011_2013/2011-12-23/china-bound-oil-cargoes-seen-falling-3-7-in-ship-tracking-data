Crude-oil shipments hauled by
supertankers bound for  China  fell 3.7 percent this week,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vessels with a total carrying capacity of 15.8 million
deadweight tons are heading for the Asian nation, down from 16.4
million tons in the week ended Dec. 16. About 13 percent of the
total fleet of the largest  oil tankers  signaling future
destinations is bound for China, the world’s biggest energy
consumer.  The following table shows the destinations of 414 very
large crude carriers, or 74 percent of the global fleet, and the
combined carrying capacity in deadweight tons, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Average drafts are expressed as a
percentage of maximum sailing depth and are an indication of
cargo size. Each country’s percentage share of total oil
shipments is shown for the current and prior weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
