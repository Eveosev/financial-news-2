Germany  will help the rest of  Europe 
stem the debt crisis because taking an anti-European stance is
“wrong,” said President  Christian Wulff , a party ally of
Chancellor  Angela Merkel .  “We Germans experienced European solidarity again and
again and we will offer solidarity to Europe in the future as
well,” Wulff said, according to an advance copy of a Christmas
Day speech released by his  office  in Berlin today. Germany will
find “a spirit of unity” with its European and global partners
that points the way out of the crisis.  Wulff, a former deputy head of Merkel’s Christian
Democratic Union party whose current post is mainly ceremonial,
said Europe is “our common home,” whose values must be
defended jointly. “Whoever says otherwise may earn applause for
a short time, but they would be wrong,” he said in the speech
for broadcast on national television tomorrow.  Merkel, whose governing coalition helped elect Wulff in
2010, is on a winter break after a year marked by state-election
losses for her party as euro-area leaders struggled to stamp out
the debt crisis and prevent a possible breakup of the joint
currency.  Wulff apologized yesterday for failing to disclose a loan
provided by a businessman’s wife in 2008 when he was state
premier of Lower Saxony. It was his first public response to
criticism by opposition parties and German media about an
incident that may make him a liability for Merkel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
