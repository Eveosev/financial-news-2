The naira weakened against the
dollar to its lowest level in more than 17 years.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer declined 0.6
percent to 164.98 in interbank trading as of 4 p.m. in Lagos,
taking its decline this week to 2.1 percent and the lowest since
March 1994 when Bloomberg began compiling the data. Nigeria
plans to increase expenditure in 2012 by 6 percent to 4.8
trillion naira ($29 billion), President  Goodluck Jonathan  said
in a budget speech to lawmakers on Dec. 13.  “There has been pressure on the naira this week arising
from fears that  government spending  and removal of fuel subsidy
as well conditions in some countries globally will expose naira
to further depreciation next year”, Tayo Omidiji, head of
research at Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone
today. “There is a drop in foreign currency flows from  Europe 
and United States into the country, which is affecting supply.”  International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said Dec. 20 that the euro region needs “special
attention” to prevent the contagion from spreading into the
global economy.  The dark clouds of risk are gathering, and Nigeria and
others in Africa will need to watch them carefully, Lagarde
said.  The central bank on Nov. 21 lowered the midpoint of the
exchange-rate band to 155 naira per dollar from 150 naira as
rising imports and weakening oil prices increased pressure on
the currency. Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy
depends on oil exports for more than 95 percent of foreign
income, according to the  Finance Ministry .  Ghana’s cedi appreciated less than 0.1 percent to 1.6395
per dollar as of 4 p.m. in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
