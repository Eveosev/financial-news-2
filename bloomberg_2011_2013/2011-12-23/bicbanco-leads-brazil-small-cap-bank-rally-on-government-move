Banco Industrial e Comercial SA  led
a rally for smaller Brazilian lenders after the central bank
moved to protect the industry from a funding squeeze fueled by
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  BicBanco, as the company is known, gained 3.6 percent to
7.87 reais at 12:53 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , while  Banco Indusval SA (IDVL3) 
rose 3.1 percent to 6.60 reais and  Banco do Estado do Rio Grande
do Sul SA , known as Banrisul, added 1.6 percent to 19.52 reais.
They outpaced advances by their largest rivals, with  Itau
Unibanco Holding SA  climbing 1.3 percent to 34.84 reais.  Policy makers encouraged purchases of the smallest lenders’
assets by enacting new rules under which banks will be allowed
to use part of their  reserve requirements  to purchase credit
portfolios and longer-term bonds known as letras financeiras
from banks whose capital doesn’t exceed 2.2 billion reais ($1.2
billion). If they don’t, they’ll be punished by losing 11
percent interest payments on some of the funds they’re required
to deposit at the central bank.  “This is good for smaller banks,” Aloisio Lemos, a
banking analyst at Agora Corretora, said in a telephone
interview from  Rio de Janeiro . “The central bank is very
attentive to the question of solidity and liquidity in the
financial system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
