 Warm weather for the rest of the
year in  Russia ’s Northern Caucasus area and Krasnodar and
Stavropol regions will help winter grain crops, according to the
Federal Hydrometeorological Center.  About 950,000 hectares (2.3 million acres), or 6 percent,
of Russian fields sown with winter grains were undeveloped as of
Dec. 10, Anna Strashnaya, head of the agricultural-forecasts
department at the center, said by phone yesterday.  The North-Caucasus and Southern federal districts have most
of the undeveloped crops, with 14 percent and 7 percent
respectively, she said.  Temperatures in the Northern Caucasus area and in the
Krasnodar and Stavropol regions are expected to be 3 degrees to
4 degrees Celsius (37.4 to 39.2 Fahrenheit) for the rest of the
month, the forecaster said.  Andrei Sizov Jr., managing director of Moscow-based
 SovEcon , expects next season’s grain crop to be about 90 million
metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
