Joy Global Inc. (JOYG) , the maker of P&H
and Joy mining machinery, won approval from China’s anti-
monopoly authority for its $584 million purchase of coal-mining
equipment maker  International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd. (1683)   The company now will proceed with the purchase of a 41.1
percent stake in International Mining from private-equity firm
The Jordan Company LP as agreed on July 11 at HK$8.50 a share,
Milwaukee-based Joy said yesterday in a statement.  Joy will own about 69.2 percent of International Mining
after the purchase and will make an offer for the balance of the
shares as required under the  Hong Kong  Takeovers Code. The
Chinese company makes shearers that cut coal and produces
excavating and tunneling machines.  “International Mining’s product range is wide and it’s one
of the market leaders,” said John Luo, Hong Kong-based analyst
at Guosen Securities Co. “ Joy Global  through this acquisition
can capture the Chinese market more comprehensively.”  Hong Kong-listed International Mining rose as much as 4.3
percent to HK$8.65, the highest in seven months, and traded at
HK$8.54 at 2:07 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
