Treasuries  fell, with 30-year yields
increasing the most in a week since October, as reports showing
the  U.S. economy  is strengthening offset concern Europe is
struggling to contain its sovereign-debt crisis.  Ten-year yields touched the highest level in more than a
week as sales of new homes in the U.S. rose to a seven-month
high and durable-goods orders increased. Reports yesterday
showed  consumer confidence  climbed and initial claims for
jobless benefits unexpectedly fell, cutting safety demand.  “There’s a positive feedback loop emerging in the
economy,” said Carl J. Riccadonna, economist in New York at
Deutsche Bank AG, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
 Federal Reserve . “People are still optimistic about the broader
economy. There’s evidence of positive feedback that will
hopefully intensify in the next year. Markets are so thin now.”  The 30-year  bond yield  climbed eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 3.06 percent at 2 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 3.08
percent, the highest level since Dec. 13, The 3.125 percent
securities due in November 2041 dropped 1 1/2, or $15 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 10/32. The yield increased 21 basis points
this week, the most since the five days ended Oct. 14.  The long-bond yield has fallen from a 2011 high of 4.79
percent in February as investors have sought safety amid
Europe’s debt crisis and concern the U.S. economy would founder.  Most in Three Years  Today’s increase pared 30-year yields’ drop this year to
127 basis points, which still would be the biggest annual
reduction since 2008. The securities have returned 33 percent in
2011, more than triple the 9.3 percent gain in the broader
Treasury market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes showed.  Yields on  10-year  notes increased eight basis points today
to 2.02 percent and touched 2.04 percent, also the highest level
since Dec. 13. They gained 18 basis points this week.  Policy makers in  Europe  shouldn’t shirk from using
quantitative easing to spur growth if deflation becomes a danger
to the euro region amid its sovereign-debt turmoil, European
Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said in
an interview published yesterday by the Financial Times. Juergen
Stark, another board member, told  Germany ’s Die Welt newspaper
in an interview published today the central bank doesn’t “have
a mandate” for unlimited purchases of  government bonds .  “Europe continues to be a driver,” said Justin Lederer,
an interest-rate strategist in New York at the primary dealer
Cantor Fitzgerald LP. “These issues aren’t going to go away any
time soon. Until we get clarity, the safe-haven bid will remain.
It’s one step forward, two steps back in many cases.”  Lower Volume  About $130 billion of Treasuries  changed hands  yesterday
through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker. The
amount was the least on a daily basis since Nov. 25 and below
the 2011 average of $288 billion. The Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association recommended that trading of
Treasuries  end today  at 2 p.m. New York time and that markets be
closed on Dec. 26 in observance of the Christmas holiday.  “It’s just very light holiday trading, and next week will
be the same,” Cantor’s Lederer said.  The yield  difference  between 10-year Treasuries and
inflation-protected debt, a measure of the outlook for consumer
prices known as the break-even rate, increased to 2.08 percent,
the widest in more than two weeks on a closing basis.  Home Sales  Treasury yields increased as Commerce Department data
showed purchases of single-family  properties  last month
increased 1.6 percent to a 315,000 annual pace. Bookings for
equipment meant to last at least three years rose 3.8 percent in
November, compared with no change in the prior month, the
department said.  Consumer purchases rose 0.1 percent for a second month,
separate Commerce Department data showed. Adjusted for
inflation, the figure used to calculate gross domestic product,
 consumer spending  rose 0.2 percent for a second month. The
median estimate for spending in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists called for a 0.3 percent advance.  U.S. consumer confidence increased to a six-month high of
69.9 in December in a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
index released yesterday.  Labor Department data yesterday showed initial jobless
claims fell by 4,000 to 364,000 last week, versus a forecast in
a Bloomberg survey for an increase to 380,000.  Volatility in the Treasury market has dropped. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measure price swings
in Treasuries based on prices of over-the-counter options
maturing in two to 30 years, fell to 90.2 yesterday, approaching
the lowest level since August. The 2011 average is 94.2, with a
high of 117.8 on Aug. 8 and a low of 71.5 on May 31.  The yield on the 30-year bond will increase to 3.36 percent
by the end of June, according to the average forecast of banks
and securities companies surveyed by Bloomberg, with the most
recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings. The 10-year note
yield may climb to 2.32 percent, a separate survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
