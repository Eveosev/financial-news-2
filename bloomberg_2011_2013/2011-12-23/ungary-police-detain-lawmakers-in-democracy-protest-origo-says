Hungarian police detained leaders of
opposition parties, including former prime minister Ferenc
Gyurcsany, at a demonstration outside parliament today, news
website  Origo  reported.  Lawmakers from the Politics Can Be Different, or LMP, party
chained themselves to objects at the entrance in protest at
draft government bills that they say threaten democracy and that
are due to be voted on today, Origo said.  Police carried off LMP members of parliament and
politicians from the Socialist and Democratic Coalition parties,
including Gyurcsany, who joined the LMP protesters, the website
added.  There were scuffles between police and the LMP lawmakers,
after which officers seized some MPs and carried them to police
vehicles, Origo added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
