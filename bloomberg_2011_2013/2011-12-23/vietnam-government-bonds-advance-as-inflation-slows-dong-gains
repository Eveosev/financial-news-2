Vietnam’s two-year bonds gained on
speculation commercial lenders will lower  interest rates  after
inflation slowed for a fourth month. The dong advanced.  Consumer prices  climbed 18.13 percent this month from a
year earlier, compared with a 19.83 percent increase in November,
according to data from the General Statistics Office today.
Interest rates on dong deposits may ease to around 10 percent by
the end of next year should inflation cool to below 10 percent,
online newspaper Dan Tri reported yesterday, citing central bank
Governor Nguyen Van Binh. Lenders are currently offering rates
of 14 percent, the central bank said on its website today.  “Yields dropped as investors expect interest rates will
decline next year,” said Do Thi Phuong Trang, a trader at the
treasury department of Bank for Investment & Development of
 Vietnam .  The  yield  on the benchmark two-year notes fell eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 12.59 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong gained 0.1 percent to 20,983 per dollar as of 3:22
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,813, unchanged since
Dec. 14, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
