Wheat rose, heading for the longest
rally in almost 11 months, on speculation that demand will rise
for supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter. Corn
and soybeans gained.  U.S. exporters sold 120,000 metric tons of hard, red winter
wheat for delivery before May 31 to  Nigeria , the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said today. Prices had dropped 22 percent this
year as of yesterday, after production climbed 5.7 percent to a
record 688.97 million tons, USDA data show. Cheaper grain may
spur purchases.  “Sales may start to increase,”  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc in West Des Moines, Iowa, said in a
telephone interview. “Rallies will be anchored by large world
supplies.”  Wheat futures for March delivery rose 0.8 percent to
$6.2675 a bushel at 11:23 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices are headed for a sixth straight gain, the longest really
since late January. The grain touched $6.2725, the highest since
Dec. 5.  Corn and soybean crops in  Argentina  will receive rain
through Dec. 29 that will improve soil moisture after warm, dry
weather earlier this month threatened production, the Buenos
Aires Cereals Exchange said yesterday. Rain may relieve crop
stress in parts of Brazil, World Weather Inc. said in a report.
Prices for both commodities touched one-month highs yesterday.  “It’s a little premature to start slashing crop estimates
in  South America , and most of the crop damage that has occurred
is already priced into the markets,”  Shawn McCambridge , the
senior grain analyst for Jefferies Bache Commodities Inc. in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Corn futures for March delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$6.1875 a bushel in Chicago. Yesterday, the price touched $6.25,
the highest since Nov. 18.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$11.755 a bushel on the CBOT. Yesterday, the oilseed touched
$11.775, the highest since Nov. 18.  The U.S. was the largest exporter of all three commodities
last season. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7
billion in 2010, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
