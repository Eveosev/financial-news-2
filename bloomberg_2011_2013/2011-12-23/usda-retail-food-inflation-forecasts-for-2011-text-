Following is the text detailing
forecasts for percentage changes in annual food prices,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture :  With 11 months of data recorded, the outlook for the 2011
Consumer  Price Index  (CPI) and food price inflation has become
clear. The CPI for all food is projected to increase 3.25 to
3.75 percent. Food-at-home (grocery store) prices are forecast
to rise 4.25 to 4.75 percent, while food-away-from-home
(restaurant) prices are forecast to increase 2 to 2.5 percent.
Although food price inflation was relatively weak for most of
2009 and 2010, cost pressures on wholesale and retail food
prices due to higher food commodity and energy prices, along
with strengthening global food demand, have pushed inflation
projections upward for 2011.  For 2012, food price inflation is expected to abate from 2011
levels but is projected to be slightly above the historical
average for the past two decades. The all-food CPI is projected
to increase 2.5 to 3.5 percent over 2011 levels, with food-at-
 home prices  increasing 3 to 4 percent and food-away-from-home
prices increasing 2 to 3 percent. While many inflationary
pressures that drove prices up in 2011 are not expected to
intensify and may even decrease in 2012, retailers have been
slow to pass on cost increases to date. Price levels in 2012
will hinge significantly on several macroeconomic factors such
as weather conditions, fuel prices, and the value of the U.S.
dollar (an indicator of global demand). An end-of-year surge in
prices has increased the starting point for 2012 prices, which
may reflect more moderate inflationary figures for 2012.  November 2011 Prices (Not Seasonally Adjusted)  The CPI for all food decreased 0.1 percent from October to
November 2011, increased 0.2 percent from September to October
2011, and is now 4.6 percent above the November 2010 level. The
food-at-home CPI decreased 0.4 percent in November 2011 and is
up 5.9 percent from last November, while the food-away-from-home
index was up 0.3 percent in November 2011 and is 2.9 percent
above last November. Food commodity and energy price increases
over the past year, combined with a weak  U.S. dollar , have
caused most of the grocery store price increases observed in
2011. The all-items CPI was down 0.1 percent in November and is
3.4 percent above the November 2010 level.  Beef prices were up 0.4 percent in November and are 9.8 percent
above last November, with steak prices up 9.4 percent and ground
beef prices up 10.2 percent. Pork prices decreased 0.9 percent
in November and are 6.9 percent above last November’s level.
Poultry prices decreased 0.7 percent in November and are 3.0
percent above prices last year at this time, with chicken prices
up 1.2 percent and other poultry prices (including turkey) up
10.5 percent. Beef and pork prices have significantly outpaced
most other indexes in 2011 due to higher input costs and
structural inflation resulting from low inventories and strong
international demand. Beef and pork prices are now expected to
exceed 2010 levels by 9.5 to 10 percent for beef and 8.0 to 8.5
percent for pork.  Egg prices decreased 0.7 percent in November 2011; egg prices
remain high and are now 10.2 percent above the November 2010
level. The inventory of table egg-laying hens in the U.S.
decreased for much of 2011 which has contributed to a surge in
prices in the final quarter of 2011. Egg prices in 2011 are
forecast to exceed 2010 levels by 8.25 to 8.75, although
inflation for these products is expected to abate considerably
in 2012.  Fish and seafood prices were up 0.3 percent from October to
November 2011 and are 5.9 percent above the November 2010 level.
Rising feed prices, in conjunction with shocks to the global
market resulting from Japanese supply disruptions, have led to
fish and seafood prices that are considerably higher than 2010
levels. The 2011 outlook is for prices to surpass 2010 prices by
6.5 to 7.0 percent.  Dairy prices were down 0.3 percent from October to November
2011, compared with a 0.1-percent increase from September to
October 2011. Dairy prices are now 8.7 percent above the
November 2010 level. Within the dairy category, prices changed
as follows in November: milk prices were down 0.4 percent and
are 9.8 percent above last November’s prices; cheese prices were
down 0.7 percent and are 8.4 percent above last November’s
level; ice cream and related product prices were unchanged and
are 10.3 percent above last November’s level; and butter prices
decreased 5.9 percent this month and are 1.1 percent below last
November. In 2010, dairy prices were up only 1.1 percent from
2009 (following a 6.4-percent decline from 2008 to 2009). Due to
higher projected prices for farm milk in 2011, ERS forecasts
that retail dairy prices will increase 6.25 to 6.75 percent over
2010.  Fresh fruit prices decreased 0.7 percent in November, and the
fresh fruit index is up 2.6 percent overall from last year at
this time, with apple prices up 9.6 percent, banana prices up
4.8 percent, citrus fruit prices up 1.7 percent, and other fresh
fruit prices down 0.2 percent. The fresh vegetable index
decreased 0.1 percent in November. Since last year at this time,
fresh vegetable prices are up 5.0 percent, with potato prices up
12.0 percent, lettuce prices up 4.3 percent, tomato prices up
4.1 percent, and other fresh vegetable prices up 3.4 percent
from this time last year. A year of unpredictable weather has
had a major impact on fresh vegetable prices which are now
expected to be 5.5 to 6.0 percent above last year’s prices.
Processed fruit and vegetable prices decreased 1.2 percent in
November and are 7.7 percent above the November 2010 level. The
contracts within the processed fruit and vegetable industry have
kept price inflation below that for fresh fruits and vegetables
throughout 2011, though overall prices for these foods will
exceed 2010 levels by 2.5 to 3.0 percent.  Cereal and bakery product prices were unchanged from October to
November 2011 and are up 6.2 percent from last year at this
time, with bread prices up 6.1 percent and breakfast cereal
prices up 6.6 percent over the past year. Lower yields for hard
red varieties of wheat due to a number of weather-related
factors have raised wheat prices for 2011. However, these price
increases have not been passed on to retail prices to the extent
expected, resulting in average prices that will be 3.5 to 4.0
percent above those in 2010. Sugar and sweets prices were down
1.7 percent in November and are 4.7 percent above last November.
Prices for nonalcoholic beverages, including coffee and
carbonated beverages, are down 0.3 percent in November 2011 and
are up 4.4 percent from last year.  The index for fats and oils was down 0.6 percent from October to
November 2011 and is 11.1 percent above the November 2010 level.
The final forecast for 2011 is for prices for fats and oils to
exceed 2010 levels by 8.5 to 9.0 percent. The significant price
increase over 2010 is due in large part to surging soybean
prices.  Food CPI and Expenditures: What’s Behind the Forecasts?  ERS regularly updates and provides food price forecasts for the
short-term period of 12 to 18 months. These forecasts are a
composite of formal model results and judgment. Monthly Bureau
of Labor Statistics’ indexes for all food, food away from home,
food at home, and 15 food at home categories are used in
conjunction with ERS analysis to adjust the current short-term
forecasts for each of the food categories.  ERS food price forecasts are developed through a three-step
process:  First, USDA develops its 10-year baseline projections. The
baseline provides long run projections for the agricultural
sector and covers agricultural commodities, agricultural trade,
and aggregate indicators of the sector, including farm income
and food prices. The baseline projections are a conditional
scenario with no shocks and are based on specific assumptions
regarding the macroeconomy, agricultural policy, the weather,
and international developments. In particular, the baseline
incorporates provisions of the Farm Security and Rural
Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Act) and assumes that current
farm legislation remains in effect through the projections
period. For the actual projections, see the USDA Agricultural
Baseline Projections Briefing Room.  In the second step, ERS analysts develop the short-term
forecasts that incorporate the most recent baseline assumptions
and current information on market conditions and expectations,
weather patterns, commodity prices and supplies, and expected
consumer demand for specific foods.  In the third step, these short-term forecasts are compared
with a computer-based Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) model that determines whether the ERS short-term
forecast falls within an expected statistical range of a 95-
percent confidence interval.  Food price forecasts developed using this three-step process are
subject to revision if the conditions on which they are based
should change significantly. Projections could be affected by
changes, for example, in the feed grain crop outlook; in export
markets, especially for meat items; in nonfarm markets; or in
weather-related crop conditions in major fresh fruit and
vegetable growing areas.  Historical data indicate that fresh fruits and vegetables and
egg prices are the most volatile food prices that ERS tracks.
Grain price changes affect the price of meats, poultry, eggs,
and dairy products more than the prices of other food items and
to a lesser extent cereals and bakery products. Because these
items account for more than half of the at-home food dollar,
price changes for these categories can significantly affect the
 Consumer Price Index  (CPI) for food at home.  SOURCE:  U.S. Department of Agriculture  To contact the reporter on this story:
