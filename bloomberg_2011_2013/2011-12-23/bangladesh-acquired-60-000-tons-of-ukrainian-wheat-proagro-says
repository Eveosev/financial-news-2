Bangladesh  purchased 60,000 metric
tons of Ukrainian wheat under an agreement between the two
governments, agricultural researcher ProAgro said.  The price was $280 a ton with the shipper paying the cost
of delivery to the ship, cargo insurance and freight cost to the
destination. The cost was lower than a market price, the Kiev-
based researcher ProAgro said. It is almost 13 percent lower
than Bangladesh paid for Ukrainian wheat in September, according
to the researcher.  To contact the reporters on this story:
