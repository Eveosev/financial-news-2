Crude oil may rise next week on
speculation that further sanctions against  Iran  will curb supply
from the world’s third-largest oil exporter, a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  Twelve of 32 analysts, or 38 percent, forecast oil will
gain through Dec. 30. Ten respondents, or 31 percent, predicted
prices will drop and 10 estimated there will be little change.
Last week, 53 percent of surveyed analysts expected an increase.
Oil is up 25 percent this quarter, the biggest gain since the
second quarter of 2009.  Iran’s navy will hold 10 days of maneuvers east of the
Strait of Hormuz, state-run Fars news agency reported on Dec.
21, citing Navy Commander Habibollah Sayari. The European Union
and the U.S. are seeking support from the  Middle East  and  Asia 
for sanctions against Iran, which exports more crude than any
nation except  Saudi Arabia  and  Russia .  “The market will continue higher due to geopolitical
tensions,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist and
founder of Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “Prices may rise to between
$100 and $103 next week.”  Iran’s military exercise will start Dec. 24 and cover a
distance of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles), Fars news agency
 reported  on its website. State-run Press TV reported the
maneuvers would extend east as far as the  Indian Ocean .  About 15.5 million barrels of oil a day flows through the
waterway between Iran and Oman at the mouth of the  Persian Gulf ,
according to the U.S. Energy Department.  European Union nations, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific allies
met in Rome Dec. 20 and discussed possible measures to increase
pressure on the country to abandon a suspected nuclear weapons
program, according to an Italian Foreign Ministry statement.  Crude oil for February delivery has advanced $5.82, or 6.2
percent, to $99.35 a barrel so far this week on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures are up 8.7 percent this year.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 48 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
