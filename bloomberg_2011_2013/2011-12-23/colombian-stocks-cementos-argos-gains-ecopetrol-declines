The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  fell 0.1 percent to 12,788.96, while the
Colcap Index was little changed at 1,600.40.  Cementos Argos (CEMARGOS)  , Colombia’s biggest cement
maker, rose 0.7 percent to 10,860 pesos. Colombia’s economy grew
7.7 percent from a year ago in the third quarter, led by mining
and construction sectors, the national statistics agency said
yesterday.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest oil company,
fell 0.3 percent to 4,285 pesos after the company said a fuel
pipeline exploded in the central province of Risaralda.  Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said the company
would pay for any damages after at least 11 people were killed,
78 were injured, dozens of homes were destroyed and two
aqueducts were damaged in the blast. He said it may have been
caused by “delinquents” trying to steal fuel, according to a
statement on the presidential website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
