Serbia breached its limit on public
debt this year and must act fast to contain it amid a possible
stagnation of the economy next year, the country’s Fiscal
Council said.  Public debt will likely reach 46 percent of economic output
by the end of the month, above the 45 percent limit agreed with
the  International Monetary Fund , and may grow beyond 50 percent
next year unless the state reigns in spending, the council said
today in a report on fiscal strategies and the 2012 budget.  The budget draft is “overly optimistic” on expected
GDP growth of 1.5 percent, said Pavle Petrovic, who heads the
Council. Falling demand in the European Union, Serbia’s main
export market, will affect inflows and foreign investments will
also decline, he said, predicting “zero growth” in 2012.  The government needs to “prepare immediate, short-term
measures in case such a scenario proves to be true, which may
happen in the first months,” of 2012, Petrovic said. Raising
value-added tax to 20 percent from 18 percent, a freeze on
public wages and pensions are among the options, he said.  Serbia  must reduce its public spending from 44.2 percent of
GDP to no more than 40 percent and cut the budget gap to 1
percent of GDP from 4.5 percent, according to the report.  “Otherwise, there will almost certainly be a debt
crisis,” the report said. It also warned of “possible
withdrawal of investors” from Treasury bills which would create
“financing problems in the first half” of 2012.  The 2012 draft budget overstates likely revenues by 17
billion dinars ($214.5 million), even if the forecast growth of
1.5 percent is achieved, Petrovic said. The shortfall may
reach as much as 35 billion dinars, undermining plans to keep
the budget gap deficit at 4.25 percent of GDP next year.  The draft includes a central budget shortfall of 140
billion dinars ($1.77 billion), with revenue planned at 750
billion dinars and expenditures at 890 billion dinars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
