Poly Implants Protheses SA breast
implants subject to a warning by French health regulators are
used by about 25,000 Brazilian women, the newspaper Le Figaro
said on its website, citing Brazilian health regulators.  France’s Ministry of Health has recommended that women with
the implants see their doctors about having the devices removed,
following leakage that can lead to inflammations.  Brazil  has prohibited the sale of the company’s implants
since April 2010, according to the report. Health regulators
have yet to recommend whether devices already implanted should
be removed, the newspaper quoted a spokesman for the country’s
health regulatory agency as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
