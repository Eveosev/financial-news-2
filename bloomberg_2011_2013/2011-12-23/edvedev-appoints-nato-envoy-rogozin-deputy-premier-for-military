President  Dmitry Medvedev  named
 Dmitry Rogozin , Russia’s ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, as the deputy prime minister in charge of the
country’s defense industry.  Rogozin was appointed “to coordinate activity to develop
the defense industry,” Medvedev said at his residence outside
Moscow. He will liaise with Russia’s armed forces and defense
companies to ensure the timely supply of modern weaponry.  Russia’s defense industry, which was inherited from the
 Soviet Union , has suffered from delays in delivery of equipment
and cost overruns, prompting the Defense Ministry to look for
weapons in countries such as France. Russia plans to spend 20
trillion rubles ($640 billion) on defense spending through 2020.  Rogozin told Medvedev he would be “tough” in reviving the
industry and will “root out any attempts at corruption with an
iron hand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
