High-yield bonds have “a better
than usual chance” of beating stocks next year in the U.S.,
according to Martin Fridson, global credit strategist at BNP
Paribas Asset Management Inc.  Fridson drew his conclusion in a report yesterday that
analyzed yield differences, or spreads, between the bonds and
Treasury debt after adjusting for options. He also considered
price-earnings ratios for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the option-adjusted spread for
the Barclays Capital High Yield Index since August 2000, along
with the Dec. 21 reading, 708 basis points. The spread exceeds
an average of 614 basis points during the period. Each basis
point equals 0.01 percentage point.  Fridson used a different market indicator, the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index, and a longer
time frame, starting in 1988. Even so, he wrote that the spread
was also wider than the historical average, showing the bonds
were inexpensive.  When the spread exceeded the average at the start of a
year, he wrote, high-yield debt usually did better than stock
regardless of the S&P 500’s valuation. The equity index stood at
13.2 times earnings as of yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The ratio was lower than the average of 18.3 for
the study period.  “High-yield investors have a better chance of
outperforming equities when high yield is cheap,” wrote
Fridson, who is based in  New York . He added that anyone who
doesn’t expect exceptional earnings growth or a jump in P/E
ratios ought to increase their holdings of the bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
