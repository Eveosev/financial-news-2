Perfumania Holdings Inc. (PERF) , the
operator of more than 370 perfume shops, agreed to buy
manufacturer  Parlux Fragrances Inc. (PARL)  in a deal valued at about
$170 million to add a direct supply of products.  The offer of $7.91 to $8.55 per share is more than double
Parlux’s $3.40 closing price yesterday, the companies said today
in a statement.  The deal would give Perfumania control over its largest
trading partner and the maker of the Mark Ecko,  Paris Hilton  and
Nicole Miller fragrance brands. Parlux may solicit competing
offers for 30 days.  “Parlux brings a wealth of products and expertise as a
licensee manufacturer and international distributor,”
Perfumania Chief Executive Officer Mike Katz said in the
statement.  Perfumania, based in Bellport,  New York , rose 0.8 percent
to $19.70 at 4:30 p.m. in New York. The shares have more than
doubled this year. Parlux increased 2.1 percent to $3.47. The
stock has gained 18 percent this year.  Holders of Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Parlux can choose
to take $4 in cash and 0.20 share of Perfumania or .53333 of a
share of the acquirer. The limit on the number of Perfumania
shares that could be issued in the transaction is 5.92 million,
and a maximum of $61.9 million in cash may be distributed, the
companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
