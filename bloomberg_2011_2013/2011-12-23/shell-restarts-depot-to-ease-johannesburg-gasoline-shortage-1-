Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said it
restarted services at a fuel storage and distribution center in
Johannesburg that will help ease gasoline shortages.  The depot is expected to be fully operational in the next
two days, which will improve the availability of fuel in the
Gauteng region, the country’s main economic hub, over the course
of the next week, Shell said in an e-mailed statement today. The
depot in southern Johannesburg was shut after a fuel leak,
causing gas stations to run out of diesel and unleaded gasoline.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  is experiencing minor fuel disruptions at some
of its inland sites due to increased demand, spokeswoman
Nothemba Noruwana said in an e-mailed statement.  “As extra products are delivered to address one site,
another area may run out of a particular variant,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
