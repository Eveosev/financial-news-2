Texas  A&M University offensive
lineman Joseph Villavisencio was killed yesterday in a two-car
crash as he drove home after delivering gifts to families at a
mission, the  College Station , Texas-based school said.  Villavisencio, 22, swerved to avoid a buzzard on a highway
south of Normangee, Texas, and drove into the path of an 18-
wheel tractor trailer, the school said. He was a senior majoring
in radiological health engineering.  “Joey V. was a tremendous person and a great Aggie,”
athletic director Bill Byrne said in a statement. “He
epitomized selfless service in making Texas A&M a better
football team. He was an excellent student and just a great
kid.”  Earlier in the day, Villavisencio and teammates delivered
gifts purchased by the team to families at the Twin City Mission
in Bryan, Texas.  “The world lost a very special person today,” former
 Texas A&M  coach Mike Sherman said on the team’s website.
“Although his life on this earth was way too short, his impact
on the people he met will be everlasting.”  Villavisencio is survived by his parents, Christine and
Jose, and his sister, Mikeala.  The Aggies, who finished pre-bowl workouts yesterday, face
 Northwestern University  in the Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas at
Houston’s Reliant Stadium on Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
