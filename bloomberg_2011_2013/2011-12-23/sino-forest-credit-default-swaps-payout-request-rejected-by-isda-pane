A committee of banks and investors
that governs credit-default swaps rejected a request on whether
 Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , the Chinese timber company fending off fraud
allegations, triggered payouts on contracts linked to its debt.  The  International Swaps and Derivatives Association ’s
determinations committee for  Asia  excluding  Japan  declined the
Dec. 19 request, which had asked whether a so-called failure-to-
pay credit event occurred, the trade group said on its  website .  Sino-Forest received notices of default on Dec. 16 on
senior notes due 2014 and 2017 after failing to publish its
third-quarter financial results in a “timely manner,”
according to a Dec. 18 statement from the company. Sino-Forest,
which said last week it expected to receive the default notices,
said it’s now seeking waivers from bondholders.  The $399.5 million of 10.25 percent notes due in July 2014
have tumbled to 26 cents on the dollar from more than 116 cents
in January, according to Trace, the bond price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, after short-
seller Carson Block’s Muddy Waters LLC said it overstated
timberland holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
