A fuel pipeline exploded in central
 Colombia , killing at least 11 people and injuring 78 as a
fireball shot down a creek and scorched dozens of homes as
residents were sleeping.  President  Juan Manuel Santos  traveled to the province of
Risaralda, in Colombia’s coffee-growing region, to oversee
search and rescue efforts. He said authorities are investigating
the cause of the two explosions, which occurred around 4:40 a.m.
local time and may have been caused by thieves trying to siphon
fuel through one of the valves in the pipeline.  The Salgar-Cartago pipeline is operated by state-oil
company  Ecopetrol (ECOPETL)  SA, Colombia’s largest oil company. Santos
said that Ecopetrol would pay for any damages arising from the
blast.  Ecopetrol fell 1 percent to 4,260 pesos at 1:29 p.m. in
Bogota. The benchmark IGBC General index rose 0.1 percent.  “Perhaps there will be some kind of economic contingency
for the company but we have to wait to see what the government
says,” said Catalina Ricaurte, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Serfinco.  Images broadcast on RCN television showed rescue dogs
searching for victims among the ruble left by destroyed houses.
A police spokesman said that the death toll could rise as
rescuers comb through the rubble of 46 flattened homes.  Ecopetrol said in a statement that it suspended the flow of
fuel through the pipeline and its workers are in the area
helping in the emergency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
