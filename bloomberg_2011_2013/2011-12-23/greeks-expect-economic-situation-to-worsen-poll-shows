Most Greeks expect the economic
situation to get worse and unemployment to rise over the next 12
months, a  Eurobarometer  poll showed.  Seventy-eight percent of 1,000 Greeks surveyed said they
expect the country’s finances to deteriorate in the next year
and 82 percent see the labor market worsening, according to the
first results of a November survey by the European Union’s
polling unit. Greece’s unemployment rate rose to 17.7 percent in
the third quarter, from 16.3 percent in the second, according to
Hellenic Statistical Authority data.  Greeks were the most pessimistic among European citizens
about the current state of their national economy, followed by
the Irish, Spanish and Bulgarians. The economic situation is
bad, 99 percent of Greeks polled said. Ninety-four percent said
they distrust politicians.  Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos , appointed on Nov. 11 as
head of an interim government backed by three of the five
parliamentary parties, is trying to meet a three-month deadline
to secure loans under a 130 billion-euro ($169 billion) bailout
for  Greece  agreed to by European Union leaders on Oct. 26.  Of those polled, 75 percent said they support the euro
compared with 20 percent who are against it and 5 percent who
responded they are “neutral.” More than 80 percent said they
support “stronger coordination” in economic and financial
policy for the 27-member EU.  The Greek section of the Europe-wide survey was conducted
by ICAP Plc between Nov. 5 and Nov. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
