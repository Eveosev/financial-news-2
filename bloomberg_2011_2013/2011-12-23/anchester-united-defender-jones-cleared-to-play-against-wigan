Manchester United defender  Phil
Jones  has been cleared to play against Wigan in three days,
manager  Alex Ferguson  said.  Jones left United’s match at Fulham two days ago after
being hit in the face by the elbow of Clint Dempsey as the two
jumped for a ball.  “He had some swelling in his jaw but there’s no break, no
fracture, which is good news,” Ferguson said on United’s
website. “We feared the worst because he lost his vision a bit
in that period when he came back onto the field.”  Ferguson also said that winger Ashley Young will be out for
a “few weeks” after injuring his knee against Fulham.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
