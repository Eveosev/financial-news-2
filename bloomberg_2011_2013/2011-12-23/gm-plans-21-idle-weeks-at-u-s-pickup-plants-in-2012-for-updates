General Motors Co. (GM) , preparing to
introduce new pickups in 2013, has scheduled 21 weeks without
production at three U.S. full-size truck plants next year to
update the factories for building the new models.  GM’s Fort Wayne assembly plant in Roanoke,  Indiana , is
scheduled to suspend output for nine weeks from January to
October, Chris Lee, a spokesman for the Detroit-based company,
said in a telephone interview. The automaker plans to idle its
Flint, Michigan, factory for seven weeks from June to November.
GM’s Arlington, Texas, plant is scheduled to shut for five weeks
from June to December.  The largest U.S. automaker has said it boosted profit this
year by building supply of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra
trucks, two of its most profitable models. GM is idling pickup
factories for updates and renovations so that they’re able to
assemble the automaker’s next-generation trucks.  GM had 202,720 full-size pickups in inventory at the end of
November, 105 days supply on a selling-day basis, the company
said Dec. 1. The company has said it’s targeting year-end
inventory of about 200,000 full-size pickups, or about 90 days
supply.  Capacity in 2012 at GM’s U.S. full-size pickup plants will
be about 640,000 units, according to an Aug. 4 slideshow
presentation. That’s down from “normal” capacity of about
780,000 units, the automaker said.  Scheduled down time for GM’s plant in Silao,  Mexico , that
makes full-size vehicles will be finalized after Jan. 1, Lee
said.  GM fell 1 percent to $20.50 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
