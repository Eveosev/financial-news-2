Barry Bonds ,  Major League Baseball ’s
career home-run record holder, will appeal his conviction and
sentence of two years’ probation for obstructing a U.S. probe of
steroid use in professional sports.  The former  San Francisco  Giants outfielder filed a notice
of appeal Dec. 21 in federal court in San Francisco. He was
sentenced to probation instead of prison time on Dec. 16 and was
also ordered by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston to spend 30
days in home confinement with a location monitoring device, pay
a $4,000 fine and serve 250 hours of community service.  Illston said Bonds deserved a lighter sentence than the 15-
month to 21-month prison term his conduct could have warranted
because other athletes convicted in the steroids probe had
received only probation and Bonds’s conduct was out of
character. Prosecutors had asked Illston to send Bonds to prison
for 15 months.  Bonds, 47, was found guilty of obstruction in April for
what prosecutors called his evasive response in 2003 before a
federal grand jury. Asked if his trainer,  Greg Anderson , ever
gave him anything that required a syringe for injection, Bonds
didn’t immediately say yes or no. In a 146-word response, he
spoke about being a “celebrity child” who didn’t “get into
other people’s business.” In the end, he answered, “No.”  Assistant U.S. Attorney Matt Parrella in San Francisco
declined to comment on the appeal filing.  The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
