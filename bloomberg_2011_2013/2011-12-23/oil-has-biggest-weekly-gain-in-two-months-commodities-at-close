The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.1 percent to close at 645.88 at 3:44 p.m.
in  New York , led by gasoline, hogs and copper. The UBS Bloomberg
CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials climbed 0.2 percent to 1,518,97,
up for a sixth straight session.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil rose, capping its biggest weekly gain in two
months, as U.S. economic reports signaled that growth in the
world’s biggest crude-consuming country will accelerate.  Oil for February delivery advanced 0.2 percent to $99.68 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since Dec. 13. Futures gained 6.6 percent for the
week and have climbed 9.1 percent this year after increasing 15

the session at $107.96 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European contract’s premium to Nymex crude
narrowed to $8.28 a barrel, the smallest differential based on

Texas Intermediate and Brent narrowed a sixth consecutive day.  Vitol Group failed to sell Russian Urals blend in the
Mediterranean at a lower price. No bids or offers were made for
North Sea Forties crude.  The premiums for Middle East crude for sale to  Asia  fell
against benchmark prices as refining profits weakened.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline rose to a six-week high after a U.S. government
report that durable goods orders increased last month signaled
an improving economy. Prices advanced 8 percent this week,
capping the biggest weekly gain since March.  Gasoline for January delivery rose 1.8 percent percent, to
settle at $2.6872 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange,

therm, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
the lowest since July 2010. It was at 55.9 pence at 11:25 a.m.
London time. That’s equal to $8.76 per million British thermal
