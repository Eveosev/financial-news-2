The ruble strengthened for a fourth
day against the dollar for its first weekly rise in three weeks,
after Bank Rossii unexpectedly cut the refinancing rate and oil,
 Russia ’s biggest export, advanced.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 31.21 by
the close in Moscow, its strongest level since Dec. 6. The ruble
added 0.7 percent to 40.65 versus the euro, sending the currency
to its strongest closing level since Aug. 5. That put it at
35.4580 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket, a
third day of advances.  Russia’s central bank cut the refinancing rate to 8 percent
from 8.25 percent today after inflation fell to 6.4 percent as
of Dec. 19 from a year earlier, heading for its lowest annual
growth in two decades. Oil futures rose 0.4 percent to $99.93 a
barrel after adding 0.9 percent yesterday after U.S. initial
jobless claims dropped to the lowest level since April 2008.  Investors pared bets the Russian currency will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
31.6537 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 31.7990 per dollar yesterday. The contracts are a guide to
expectations of currency movements as they allow foreign
investors and companies to fix the  exchange rate  at a particular
level in the future.  Russia’s dollar-denominated Eurobond due in 2020 was little
changed, with the yield rising 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 4.59 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
