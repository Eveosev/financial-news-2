The Swiss Financial Market
Supervisory Authority gave four banks until the end of this
month to improve their finances,  Le Temps  reported, without
citing anyone.  The regulator, known as Finma, declined to comment. Finma,
which regularly puts the country’s biggest banks, through stress
tests, said in July that it has started doing similar exercises
for smaller lenders.  Hottinger, one of two banks identified by the Swiss
newspaper, hasn’t been approached by Finma about its financial
situation, Chief Executive Officer Joerg Auf der Maur said today
in a telephone interview from Zurich.  “Our bank is in good financial health and we fulfill all
of Finma’s capital requirements,” he said.  Nobody at Faisal Bank in Geneva, the other firm cited by Le
Temps, could immediately comment when called by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
