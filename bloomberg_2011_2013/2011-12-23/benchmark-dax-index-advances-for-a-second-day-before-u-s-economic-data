German stocks (DAX)  rose, with the
benchmark DAX index extending its weekly gain, as U.S. economic
data showed a rise in durable-goods orders and new-home sales.  Wincor Nixdorf AG (WIN)  climbed 1.3 percent after signing a 400
million-euro ($521 million) credit facility.  SGL Carbon SE (SGL) 
retreated for the eighth day, its longest losing streak since
January 2010.  The DAX gained 0.5 percent to 5,878.93 at the close in
Frankfurt. The measure advanced 3.1 percent this week, trimming
its losses in 2011 to 15 percent. The broader HDAX Index also
increased 0.5 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands across  Europe  has
fallen as the Christmas holiday approaches. Trading on the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index this week has declined 22 percent compared with
the average for 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “A holiday is well deserved after an immensely stressful
year where the economic news has been so negative,” said Daniel Weston, a portfolio adviser at Schroeder Equities GmbH in
Munich. “It may only get better moving forward.”  Orders for U.S. durable goods rose in November by the most
in four months as an increase in demand for aircraft outweighed
declines in spending on computers and equipment, data from the
Commerce Department showed today in  Washington .  Home Sales  Purchases of single-family properties increased 1.6 percent
to a 315,000 annual pace, figures from the Commerce Department
showed today in Washington. The gain pushed the number of new
homes on the market to a record low.  The U.S. Congress passed a two-month payroll-tax cut
extension late yesterday, days before its scheduled Dec. 31
expiration.  Wincor Nixdorf climbed 1.3 percent to 33.70 euros. The
maker of banking machines and cash registers said it signed a
400 million-euro  credit line  to refinance and fund its business.  Stada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ) , which makes generic drugs, gained
2.5 percent to 19.43 euros.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  gained 1.7 percent to 29.80 euros. DIFC
Investments LLC repaid in full $200 million to Germany’s largest
bank under the terms of a loan facility.  Commerzbank declined 0.7 percent to 1.34 euros, erasing an
earlier gain of 1.5 percent.  SGL Carbon fell 0.5 percent to 36.69 euros, its lowest
price since Sept. 12. The maker of carbon products has declined
for eight successive days, the longest stretch of losses since
January 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
