Catch the grown-up “Nutcracker:
Rated R” at Le Poisson Rouge Friday night for an amusing send-
up of the family classic.  Created by Angela Harriell, this ballet has Clara as a
rebellious teen whose uncle Drosselmeyer takes her back to  New
York ’s 1980s club scene. The fancy footwork ranges from ballet
to breakdance.  There’s also a bit of rhythm gymnastics, presented by a
member of the 1996 German Olympic team.  At 158 Bleecker St. Information: +1-212-505-3474;

natives Yo La Tengo play their annual Hanukkah residency at
Maxwell’s.  The trio’s restless sound roves from fragile to noisy,
brassy to bluesy.  Keep in mind they usually stock their shows with surprise
guests, so each night packs a different punch.  Runs through Dec. 27 at Maxwell’s, 1039 Washington St.,
Hoboken, NJ. Information: +1-201-653-1709;

ringlets, looks up at his grandfather, whose face, filled with
humanity, is dominated by a warty, bulbous nose. Youth and age
regard one another with clear-eyed benevolence.  This is the work of Ghirlandaio, part of the  Metropolitan
Museum ’s powerful new exhibit: “The Renaissance Portrait from
Donatello to Bellini.” In more than 160 works, ranging from
painting to marble sculpture, individuals come alive across the
centuries.  Runs through March 18 at 1000 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-
212-535-7710;  http://www.metmuseum.org .  Saturday Matinee  Old madwoman or emerging artist? The great Rosemary Harris
takes on Athol Fugard’s Miss Helen in the Roundabout Theatre
Company production of “The Road to Mecca.”  Based on  South Africa ’s most famous Outsider artist, Miss
Helen is a widow in the middle of nowhere creating a weird
collection of sculptures in her garden.  Jim Dale  is the worried minister who wants to send her to
the Sunshine Home for the Aged, while Carla Gugino plays the
young friend desperate to keep her free.  In previews at the American Airlines Theatre, 227 W. 42nd
St., opening Jan. 17 for a limited run. Information: +1-212-719-
1300;  http://www.roundabouttheatre.org .  Saturday Night  A cheer goes up in the usually staid Metropolitan Opera
audience when Hansel and Gretel finally push the cannibal witch
into her own oven.  “Eat or be eaten” is the motto of the 2007 Richard Jones
production of the Engelbert Humperdinck work now in revival at
the Met.  Kate Lindsey is an appropriately boyish Hansel, while
Aleksandra Kurzak sings Gretel with sweet innocence. The
voracious villainess is played by tenor Robert Brubaker, decked
out in pearls and a too-tight skirt.  Runs through Jan. 7 at  Lincoln Center . Information: +1-
212-362-6000;  http://www.metoperafamily.org .  Sunday  Take a look at some compassionate photographs shot on New
York City streets during the Depression, World War II and the
tumultuous years that followed.  “The Radical Camera,” formed in 1936 to engage with the
city’s tough realities, shows images taken by members of the
Photo League, including Berenice Abbott, Paul Strand and Weegee.  There are shots of demonstrations, black kids playing in
the streets of Harlem and saucy girls posing for the camera at
Coney Island.  Blacklisted by the U.S. Justice Department for its
activities in 1947, the League shut down in 1951.  Runs through March 25 at the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Ave.
Information: +1-212-423-3200;  http://www.thejewishmuseum.org .  Sunday Afternoon  Grab your skates and head to the Rockefeller Center Ice
Rink, to show off your layback spins.  Towering above is the 12-ton, 74-foot tall Norway spruce
decorated with 5-miles of LED lights, topped by a Swarovski
star.  Get a special holiday premium pass to enter through the VIP
Igloo and avoid the crowds.  Off Fifth Ave. between 47th and 50th Sts. Information: +1-
212-632-3975;  http://www.rockefellercenter.com .  Then retire to the Rock Center Cafe, on the north side of
the rink, and sip a  Manhattan  while savoring the crab and
risotto cake with watercress.  For dessert, try the deep dish apple pie.  Information: +1-212-332-7620.  Sunday Evening  Soothe your soul by listening to the sounds of Christmas at
the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine performed by Early
Music New York.  Conducted by Frederick Renz, the male chamber choir with
instrumental ensemble will present medieval processional music
and early Baroque carols and noels.  Take in the Great Rose Window, made from 10,000 glass
pieces, the largest stained-glass window in the U.S.  At 1047 Amsterdam Ave. Information: +1-212-749-6600;
