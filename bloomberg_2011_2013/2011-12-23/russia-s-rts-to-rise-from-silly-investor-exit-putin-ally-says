Russian stocks may rise as much as
40 percent by the end of 2012, after plunging to a two-year low
as concerns about political unrest in  Russia  compounded a sell-
off during the European debt crisis, according to IFC Metropol
founder Mikhail Slipenchuk.  “Foreign investors’ talks about possible revolution make
me smile,” said Slipenchuk, who became a lawmaker for Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s United Russia party in elections this
month in Russia’s parliament. The sell-off is “silly,”
creating an opportunity to buy shares on the cheap, he said.
About 40 percent of Metropol’s clients are from outside Russia.  Slipenchuk, who funded a submarine to explore Lake Baikal,
the world’s biggest freshwater body, with Putin in 2009, was
nominated to parliament by the prime minister’s All-Russia
People’s Front. Ten of thousands gathered in cities nationwide
Dec. 10 to protest voter fraud in the parliamentary elections in
Russia’s biggest demonstrations in more than a decade.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index  will probably rise to
1,800 to 2,000 by the end of next year, Slipenchuk said in an
interview in Moscow. That corresponds to Citigroup Inc.’s
forecast of 2,000 published earlier this month and Otkritie
Financial Corp.’s target of 1,900, and is as much as 40 percent
higher than the close of the main session yesterday at 1,396.03.  The RTS may fall as low as 1,200 before rebounding,
Slipenchuk said. It sank to a two-year low of 1,217.21 in
October.  “Hidden dollar inflation,” fueled by the U.S. printing
money to repay debt, supports oil and gas prices, Slipenchuk
said. That in turn benefits the Russian economy and makes the
ruble one of the world’s most stable currencies, he said. The
currency may weaken “slightly” next year to 34 rubles against
the dollar, Slipenchuk said. The ruble gained for a fourth day,
adding 0.6 percent to 31.1701 against the dollar today, heading
for its strongest close since Dec. 5.  Opposition activists won government permission to hold a
rally of as many as 50,000 people in central Moscow tomorrow.
More than 41,000 people have said on Facebook Inc. that they
plan to attend.  To contact the reporters on this story:
