Oil tankers able to haul about 7.3
million barrels a day of crude went to  Saudi Arabia ’s Ras Tanura
last week, the world’s largest crude-export terminal, ship-
tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Vessels with a total capacity of 6.96 million deadweight
tons were at Ras Tanura from Dec. 11 to Dec. 17, or 28 percent
less than the previous seven-day period, the data show. The
figure was multiplied by 7.33 and then divided by seven to
estimate a barrels-a-day equivalent.  China will get the largest share of shipments, with four
loadings during the period. Very large crude carriers with a
combined capacity of about 1.22 million tons, or 8.98 million
barrels, are heading for the country after loading at the
terminal.  Japan  will receive three cargoes, the data show.  Following are the tankers that loaded at  Ras Tanura , the
companies that hired them and estimated times of arrival, where
charter data are available. Drafts are expressed as a percent of
maximum sailing depth, an indication of possible cargo size.  Where ships’ destinations are at odds with fixtures data,
they are classified as “other.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
