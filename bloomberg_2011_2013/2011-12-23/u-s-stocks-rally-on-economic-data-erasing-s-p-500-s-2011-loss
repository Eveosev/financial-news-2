U.S. stocks (SPX)  rallied for the week,
erasing the 2011 decline for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as
better-than-estimated economic data boosted confidence in the
world’s largest economy.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)  climbed more than 6.7 percent to lead advances in the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average . Energy producers and financial
companies led a surge by all  10 groups (SPXL1)  in the S&P 500, adding at
least 4.8 percent.  Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM)  soared 20 percent
after agreeing to buy startup competitor Cotendo Inc. Oracle
Corp. tumbled 11 percent after reporting quarterly earnings that
missed analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 climbed 3.7 percent for the week to 1,265.33,
including a 3 percent surge on Dec. 20, the biggest one-day
rally of the month. The Dow rose 427.61 points, or 3.6 percent,
to 12,294, extending its 2011 gain to 6.2 percent. The Dow is at
the highest level since July 27, when a political battle about
the U.S. debt ceiling led stocks on a seven-day decline.  “The fundamentals here in the U.S. have been improving and
I think investors were poised to want to see the equity prices
move up,” Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at
Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages
$54 billion, said in a telephone interview. The U.S. economic
data “puts us on a path to avert the recession going into
2012.”  Erasing Losses  The  S&P 500  erased its decline for 2011, rising 0.6 percent
for the year, after better-than-forecast economic reports
sparked a four-day rally. Gauges on employment, consumer
confidence and housing starts added to expectations that the
 U.S. economy  can weather Europe’s debt woes. The S&P 500 slumped
1.2 percent on Dec. 19 amid concern leaders weren’t making
enough progress in taming the euro-zone crisis.  Wall Street strategists forecast the S&P 500 will end the
year at 1,278, or 1 percent higher than its current level. With
four trading days left in 2011, the benchmark index for U.S.
equities would need to climb about 0.2 percent each day to reach
their projection. On average, the S&P 500 gains 1 percent in the
last four days of the year, according to data dating back to
1928 compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 gained 3 percent on Dec. 20 on a report showing
builders broke ground in November on more houses in the U.S.
than at any time in the past 19 months. Meanwhile, concern about
 Europe ’s debt crisis eased as German business confidence
unexpectedly grew and Spain sold more bills in an auction than
the maximum target.  Jobless Claims  Stocks rose further as the number of applications for
unemployment benefits for the week ended Dec. 17 unexpectedly
dropped to the lowest since April 2008. Confidence among U.S.
consumers rose more than forecast in December, to a six-month
high, as Americans began wrapping up their holiday spending.  “I’m going to call this a sign of relief over Europe
combined with incrementally positive economic news,”  Frederic
Dickson , who helps oversee $28 billion as chief market
strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co. in  Lake Oswego , Oregon, said
in a telephone interview. “The positive news carried investors
past the fact that there were a number of negative earnings
surprises this week.”  Investors also shifted their attention toward the U.S.
political scene. The U.S. Congress passed a two-month payroll
tax cut extension after House Republicans surrendered on whether
to endorse the measure days before its scheduled Dec. 31
expiration.  ‘Domestic Threat’  “The most important thing that happened was the agreement
in Washington to extend the payroll tax cuts and unemployment
benefits,” David Kelly, who helps oversee $394 billion as chief
market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “That removes probably the biggest
domestic threat to the economy in 2012.”  Gauges of energy and financial shares added 5.4 percent and
4.9 percent, respectively, for the biggest advances among 10
industry groups in the S&P 500. The  Morgan Stanley Cyclical
Index (CYC)  rallied 4.1 percent amid economic optimism. GE jumped 7.2
percent to $18.23, while Walt Disney increased 6.7 percent to
$37.70.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest U.S. energy company by
market value, gained 6.6 percent to $107.50.  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  rose 5.3 percent to $33.57.  The  European Central Bank  awarded 489 billion euros ($645
billion) in loans to the region’s banks in the latest attempt to
tame the debt crisis, far more than the median forecast for 293
billion euros in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  “There’s some expectation that U.S. banks are benefiting
from European banks pulling back, allowing them to increase
deposits and market share,” Luschini said.  Justice Department Probe  Bank of America rose 7.7 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$5.60 after agreeing to a record $335 million settlement of a
U.S. Justice Department probe into fair-lending lapses at its
Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage unit.  Akamai Technologies, operator of a server network that lets
businesses speed data delivery, rose the most in the S&P 500
after agreeing to buy Cotendo for about $268 million in cash.
The stock advanced 20 percent to $31.93.  Expedia Inc. gained 14 percent to $30.04. The online travel
agency completed the spinoff of TripAdvisor Inc.  Cintas Corp. rose 14 percent, the most since October 2008,
to $34.88. The provider of restroom supplies and entrance mats
raised its fiscal year 2012  profit forecast (CTAS)  to at least $2.16 a
share, above the average analyst estimate of $2.03 a share.  Oracle (ORCL)  declined 11 percent, the most since October 2008, to
$26.06. The world’s second-largest software maker reported
quarterly earnings that missed analysts’ estimates as customers
held off on purchasing database and applications software.  Business-software companies are taking longer to close
deals as companies gird for slow economic growth in the U.S. and
the possibility of a recession in Europe next year, said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.  Red Hat Inc. (RHT)  tumbled 13 percent, the biggest decline in the
S&P 500, to $41.59. The largest seller of the open-source Linux
operating system reported third-quarter billings and deferred
revenue that missed some analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
