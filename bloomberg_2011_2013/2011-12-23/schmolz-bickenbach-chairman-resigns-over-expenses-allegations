Schmolz & Bickenbach AG, a Swiss
maker of industrial steel, said Chairman Michael Storm resigned
after the board discovered that he had charged the company with
personal expenses, causing an estimated shortfall of about 1.5
million euros ($1.96 million).  Storm incurred “personnel and other expenses which have
arisen through improper separation of private and company”
spending, the Emmenbruecke, Switzerland-based company today in
an e-mailed  statement .  Schmolz & Bickenbach said its operational business hasn’t
been affected by the discovery. The shares were up 1.2 percent
to 5.72 francs at 11:13 a.m. in Swiss trading, reducing the
company’s losses this year to 40 percent.  The company confirmed
its forecast for sales and profit to be “substantially higher”
in 2011 than in the previous year.  Schmolz plans to hire an outside investigator to look into
the incident, it said in the statement. Hans-Peter Zehnder was
named as the new chairman.  “We assume it won’t be necessary” to file a criminal
complaint against Storm, as he gave a written undertaking that
the missing money will be repaid in full, Chief Operating
Officer Marcel Imhof said in a telephone interview. The company
has a market value of about 676 million francs.  Storm’s office in Dusseldorf,  Germany , said he couldn’t be
reached for comment when contacted by Bloomberg News via
telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
