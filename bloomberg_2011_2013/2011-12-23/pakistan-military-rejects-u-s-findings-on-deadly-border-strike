Pakistan ’s army rejected a U.S.
Defense Department report which said American forces shared
responsibility for a Nov. 26 border clash that killed 24
Pakistani soldiers.  The “Pakistan army does not agree with the findings of the
U.S./NATO inquiry as being reported in the media,” according to
a statement posted on the army’s website today. “The inquiry
report is short on facts.”  Inadequate coordination by U.S. and Pakistan military
officers and reliance on incorrect mapping information helped
allow the battle to take place, the Defense Department said in a
statement yesterday.  The late-night strikes, in which an AC-130 gunship and two
AH-64 Apache U.S. helicopters fired rockets and munitions at two
Pakistani border posts, led Pakistan to close its territory to
military supplies for American forces in Afghanistan and to
suspend much of its military and intelligence cooperation with
the U.S.  Pakistan’s military, which didn’t participate in the
investigation, will give its full response after receiving a
copy of the report, the army said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
