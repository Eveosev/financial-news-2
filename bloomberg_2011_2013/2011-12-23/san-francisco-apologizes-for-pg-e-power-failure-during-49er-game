San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee said
the city was at fault for two power failures during a National
Football League game Dec. 19 at Candlestick Park.  In a  letter  addressed to Jed York, president and chief
executive officer of the  San Francisco 49ers  football team, Lee
said the first failure was caused by a break in the  power lines 
leading to the stadium and the second was due to a
malfunctioning switch on the backup power system.  In a separate letter to York,  PG&E Corp. (PCG) , which owns the
utility that delivers power to the stadium, said it would take
“a number of proactive steps” to improve the systems serving
the stadium.  The power failures interrupted a nationally televised game
between the San Francisco 49ers and Pittsburgh Steelers. San
Francisco  won , 20-3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
