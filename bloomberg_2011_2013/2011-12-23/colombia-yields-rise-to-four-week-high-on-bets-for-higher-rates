Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities lower, on speculation higher-
than-forecast growth will boost  tax revenue  and reduce the
government’s financing needs next year.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.65
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.220 centavo to 118.524 centavos per peso.  “The outlook is positive for 2012,” said Daniel Lozano,
an analyst at Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota. “This should
lead to good opportunities” in long-term peso bonds in the next
two months, he said.  Colombia’s economy expanded 7.7 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, the national statistics agency said
yesterday. The growth exceeded the estimates of all 30
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median forecast was for
an increase of 6 percent.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said Dec. 20 that
the government plans to raise less money in the local  bond
market  in 2012 and expects next year’s  budget deficit  to narrow
more than it originally expected, as strong economic growth
boosts tax revenue.  Colombia plans to auction 18.4 trillion pesos ($9.6
billion) of bonds in the local market next year, according to
the revised 2012 financing plan. In June, the government
forecast it would need to raise 20 trillion pesos in the
domestic market.  The consolidated budget deficit, which includes states,
municipalities and state-run companies, should fall to 1.8
percent of gross domestic product in 2012 from a projected 2.9
percent of GDP this year, Echeverry said. Tax collection surged
25 percent to 84 trillion pesos this year and is expected to
rise to 88 trillion pesos in 2012, he said.  The peso advanced 0.2 percent to 1,920.16 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,923.30 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
