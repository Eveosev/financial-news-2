Rob Cameron has stepped down as
chief executive officer of  Fairtrade International , the world’s
largest labeler of goods marketed for the benefit of poor
producers in  emerging markets .  The organization gave no reason for the resignation.  Fairtrade International was the subject of a recent report
by Bloomberg News examining its approval of cotton in a Burkina
Faso program using child labor. That program supplies fiber to
Limited Brands’ Victoria’s Secret division, which said it is
investigating the issue.  Cameron’s departure has “nothing to do with” the report,
Fairtrade International spokeswoman Reykia Fick said.  Cameron joined Fairtrade International in 2007 from Flag, a
U.K.-based adviser to companies on branding, marketing and
corporate responsibility reporting.  Sales of goods from coffee to cocoa labeled by the Bonn-
based network of 25 organizations rose 27 percent in 2010 to
4.36 billion euros ($5.7 billion). Fairtrade International
estimates there were 1.15 million farmers in its system in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
