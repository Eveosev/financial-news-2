Six-time All-Star outfielder  Carlos Beltran  has agreed to a two-year contract with the World Series
champion  St. Louis Cardinals , General Manager John Mozeliak
said.  The Cardinals did not give other details of the contract.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported the deal includes a no-
trade clause and is worth $26 million, without saying where it
got the information.  The Cardinals lost first baseman  Albert Pujols , who won
three National League Most Valuable Player awards while leading
St. Louis to two World Series titles in 11 seasons, as a free
agent to the Los Angeles Angels earlier this month.  “Beltran is a proven outfielder who obviously has been a
tough opponent against the Cardinals for many years,” Mozeliak
said in a statement on the team’s website. “It is going to be
nice to have his bat and competitive nature working for us
instead of on the other side of the field for the next couple of
years.”  During the last Major League Baseball season, the 34-year-
old Beltran hit .300 with 22 home runs in 142 games for the  New
York Mets  and  San Francisco Giants . He also has played for
Kansas City and Houston during a 14-year MLB career.  Beltran, a three-time Gold Glove winner for his defensive
play in center field, may move to right field to take the place
of Lance Berkman -- who probably will replace Pujols at first
base.  To contact the reporter on this story:
