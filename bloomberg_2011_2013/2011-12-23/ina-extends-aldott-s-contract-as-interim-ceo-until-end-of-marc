INA Industrija Nafte d.d. (INARA)  extended
managing board head Zoltan Aldott’s contract as interim chief
executive officer until March 31, 2012, the refiner said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Aldott took over as head of the company on June 15 after
Bojan Milkovic was removed from the post at his own request
following his March 26 arrest on corruption charges.  Croatia’s biggest refiner is controlled by Hungary’s  Mol
Nyrt. (MOL) , which owns 47.47 percent of INA. The government holds
44.84 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
