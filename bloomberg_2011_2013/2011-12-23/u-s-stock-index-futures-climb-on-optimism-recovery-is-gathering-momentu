U.S. stocks rose, pushing the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a 0.6 percent yearly rally, as
expansion in U.S. industrial purchases and stronger new-home
sales offset weaker-than-forecast consumer spending.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and Walt Disney Co. rose at least 2
percent, pacing gains among the largest companies.  AT&T Inc. (T)

purchase of Qualcomm Inc. airwaves. Rambus Inc. jumped 12
percent as the designer of high-speed memory chips settled
patent disputes with Broadcom Corp. Financial stocks climbed 0.7
percent, after dropping as much as 0.2 percent.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  increased 0.9 percent to 1,265.33 today. The

to 12,294, the highest since July 27, when a political battle
about the U.S. debt ceiling was leading stocks on seven-day
decline.  “The macro concerns at least temporarily are being viewed
more favorably than they have, say, two or three months ago,”
Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares
Inc., which manages $4 billion in Raleigh,  North Carolina , said
in a phone interview. “As long as the economic news shows that
the economy is hanging in there and exhibiting signs of
sustainability, then I believe the market can move modestly
upward.”  The four-day rally in the  S&P 500  this week brought the
index to a 0.6 percent advance for the year. The gauge gained
3.7 percent this week after data on employment,  consumer
confidence , housing starts and leading economic indicators added
to expectations that the  U.S. economy  can weather  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  Economic Data  Orders for U.S. durable goods rose in November by 3.8
percent, the most in four months, and more than the 2.2 percent
economists had predicted, data from the Commerce Department
showed today in  Washington .  Consumer spending  and incomes rose
less than forecast in November, while sales of new U.S. homes
rose 1.6 percent to a 315,000 annual pace in November, a seven-
month high, and matching the forecast, data show.  Wall Street strategists forecast the S&P 500 will end the
year at 1,278, or 1 percent higher than today’s close. With four
trading days left in 2011, the benchmark index for U.S. equities
would need to climb about 0.2 percent each day to reach their
projection. On average, the S&P 500 gains 1 percent in the last
four days of the year, according to data dating back to 1928
compiled by Bloomberg.  S&P 500 Components  Of the 500 companies in the index, 238 have posted advances
this year, led by Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg as of yesterday’s closing prices.

the S&P 500, adding 14 percent, while financial shares in the

by utility and telephone-company shares. U.S. stock markets will

rallied 2.4 percent to $5.60.  AT&T, the largest U.S. phone company, rallied 0.7 percent
to $29.87. Federal regulators approved its $1.93 billion
purchase of Qualcomm’s airwaves three days after AT&T dropped
its plan to buy T-Mobile USA Inc. Verizon climbed 1.8 percent to
$39.98.  Rambus jumped 12 percent to $8.21. The agreement with
Irvine, California-based Broadcom ends all litigation, including
claims related to Broadcom’s alleged past use of patented  Rambus (RMBS) 
technology. The license runs for five years, with undisclosed
financial terms, Rambus said in a statement.  TripAdvisor Rallies  TripAdvisor Inc., which replaced Tellabs Inc. in the S&P

today, falling 5.1 percent to $65.29. The Food and Drug
Administration said it may take until next week for test results
to show whether infant formula made by the company spurred a
bacterial infection that killed a newborn or if something else
was at fault.  Congress passed a two-month payroll  tax cut  extension
today, eight days before its scheduled expiration, after House
Republicans dropped their objections under growing political
pressure. House Speaker  John Boehner  agreed late yesterday to
extend the tax cut, capping a month of wrangling that led to a
revolt by House Republicans over the bipartisan deal passed by
the Senate on Dec. 17 in an 89-10 vote. The plan approved today
will go to President Barack Obama for his signature.  “That removes probably the biggest domestic threat to the
economy in 2012,”  David Kelly , who helps oversee $394 billion
as chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in  New York , said
in a telephone interview. “As the year ends, some of the
extremes in uncertainty are diminishing, and that should allow
the market to go up.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
