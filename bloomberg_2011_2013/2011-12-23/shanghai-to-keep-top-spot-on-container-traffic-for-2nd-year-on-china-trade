Shanghai,  China ’s wealthiest city,
said it will remain the world’s busiest port for a second year
as the nation’s economic growth boosts trade volumes.  Terminals in the city handled a record 30 million 20-foot
equivalent boxes in 2011, the Shanghai municipal government said
in a  statement  on its website today. The city surpassed
 Singapore  in container traffic for the first time last year by
moving 29.05 million 20-foot boxes.  Rising exports of Chinese-made goods to the U.S. and
Europe, as well as imports, boosted volumes in Shanghai. Total
exports and imports via the city’s customs increased 19 percent
to $790 billion in the first nine months of this year, the city
government said in the statement.  Shanghai International Port (Group) Co. (600018) , the port’s
operator, gained 1.2 percent to 2.65 yuan at the midday break in
Shanghai trading. The stock has lost 30 percent this year,
compared with a 21 percent drop in the Shanghai Stock Exchange
Composite Index.  The statement didn’t provide Singapore’s container traffic
volume this year. Singapore handled 27.3 million 20-foot
containers in the first 11 months of 2011, according to the
 Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore , which is scheduled to
provide full-year figures in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
