The Republic of Congo will export
six 920,000-barrel cargoes of Djeno crude in February, unchanged
from next month, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The country also plans to ship two consignments of 950,000
barrels each of N’Kossa grade in February, compared with one
next month, the plan showed. Total SA,  France ’s largest oil
producer, operates the two fields.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
