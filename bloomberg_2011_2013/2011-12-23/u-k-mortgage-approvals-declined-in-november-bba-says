U.K. mortgage approvals fell in
November as a darkening economic outlook prompted households to
repay rather than add to debt, the British Bankers’ Association
said.  Lenders granted 34,738 loans to buy homes, down from a
revised 35,196 in October, the London-based trade group said
in an e-mailed report today. From a year earlier, mortgage
approvals rose from 29,875.  “Until there are clear signs of improvement in the economy
and stability on the international front, households and
businesses lack the confidence needed to seek credit for
spending or investment,” BBA statistics director
 David Dooks  said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
