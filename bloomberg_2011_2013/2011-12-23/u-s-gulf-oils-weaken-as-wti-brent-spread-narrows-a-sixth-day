Most U.S. Gulf oils weakened as the
difference between West Texas Intermediate and Brent narrowed a
sixth consecutive day.  The spread between the two benchmark crude futures for
February delivery decreased 36 cents to $8 a barrel at 1:02 p.m.
in  New York  today. The differential has narrowed 71 percent
since reaching a record of $27.88 a barrel Oct. 14.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI dropped 35 cents to
$8.65 a barrel at 11:49 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet  increased $2 to
$10.50 over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI sank 10 cents to $6.50. The
premium for Mars Blend slipped 10 cents to $5.40 a barrel.
 Poseidon ’s premium weakened 45 cents to $4.45 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium decreased 10 cents to $3.95
a barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount narrowed 10 cents to
$1.25 under WTI.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  was unchanged at
$15.75 a barrel.  Syncrude ’s premium was unchanged at $2.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
