A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , the maker of
batteries for electric vehicles, said it found a “potential
safety issue” in batteries it supplies to Fisker Automotive
Inc.  A123, which also sells batteries to automakers such as
General Motors Co. and  Daimler AG (DAI) , said hose clamps that are
part of the internal cooling system of its batteries supplied to
Fisker were “misaligned” and may cause coolant to leak. Such a
leak could lead to an electrical short circuit, David Vieau,
chief executive officer, wrote in a  memo  on Waltham,
Massachusetts-based A123’s investor-relations website.  “We have developed a confirmed repair for this
situation,” Vieau wrote, adding that the company has begun to
fix the fewer than 50 cars affected. A123 expects a “minimal
financial impact” and its relationship with Fisker “remains
strong,” he wrote.  Fisker, based in Anaheim,  California , is ramping up U.S.
deliveries of $102,000 Karma plug-in hybrid sedans. Shipments
have begun with 225 sent to dealers and 1,200 units “in the
pipeline,” Chief Executive Officer Henrik Fisker said in a Dec.
21 interview.  Karma production is now 25 units a day and may rise to 60 a
day next year, said Fisker, a vehicle designer who has styled
cars for Aston Martin and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW.  A123 will supply battery packs for Detroit-based GM’s
Chevrolet Spark electric subcompact going on sale in 2013. The
company has reported losses in every quarter since 2008 and went
public in September 2009.  A123 rose 2.9 percent to $1.77 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
