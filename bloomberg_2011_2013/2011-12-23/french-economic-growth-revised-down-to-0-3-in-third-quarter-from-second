The French economy, the euro
region’s second largest, grew at a weaker pace than previously
estimated in the third quarter as companies cut spending.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.3 percent from the second
quarter, when it fell 0.1 percent, French statistics institute
Insee in Paris said today. It had previously reported a gain of
0.4 percent. In the year, the economy expanded 1.5 percent, down
from 1.7 percent in the previous quarter.  The French economy is probably already in recession, with
output shrinking this quarter and next, Insee said last week.
While French  business confidence  dropped to the lowest in 1 1/2
years in December and manufacturing contracted, government
leaders have refused to use the word recession, saying  France  is
in a “slowdown” or an “air pocket.”  French investment growth slowed to 0.2 percent in the third
quarter from 0.6 percent in the previous three months, today’s
report showed.  Consumer spending  increased 0.3 percent after
dropping 0.6 percent in the second quarter and exports advanced
0.8 percent, up from 0.7 percent.  The weaker-than-initially-estimated growth in the third
quarter was due to revisions to industrial production as well as
to new figures on company revenues, Insee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
