U.S. stock futures pared gains as
 consumer spending  rose less than forecast in November, signaling
the biggest part of the  U.S. economy  may struggle to pick up.  S&P 500  futures expiring in March increased 0.4 percent to
1,254.1 at 8:34 a.m. New York time. The benchmark gauge advanced
0.8 percent to a two-week high yesterday.  Purchases rose 0.1 percent for a second month, Commerce
Department figures showed today in Washington. Incomes also grew
0.1 percent, the weakest in three months, after a 0.4 percent
rise in October. The median estimate for spending in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists called for a 0.3 percent advance.  A separate report showed orders for U.S. durable goods rose
in November by the most in four months as an increase in demand
for aircraft outweighed declines in spending on computers and
equipment.  A three-day rally in the S&P 500 has trimmed the index’s
decline for the year to 0.3 percent. The gauge is up 2.8 percent
this week after data on employment,  consumer confidence , housing
starts and leading economic indicators added to expectations
that the U.S. economy can weather Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
