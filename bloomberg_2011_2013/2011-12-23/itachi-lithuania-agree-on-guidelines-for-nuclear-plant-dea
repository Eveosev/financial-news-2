The Lithuanian government and
 Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  agreed on the guidelines of a preliminary agreement
to build and finance a nuclear power plant in the Baltic
country.  “This is an important intermediate point of the
negotiations,” said Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius at a press
conference following the signing the agreement in Vilnius today.
“This means it’s been agreed on the content of the concession
agreement and its components.”  Hitachi will sign the final contract to begin building the
400 billion-yen ($5.1 billion) project next year, company
President Hiroaki Nakanishi said on Dec. 20. The plant, to be
built by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy Ltd., a venture with General
Electric Co., is scheduled to be operational in 2020, said
Hitachi,  Japan ’s second-largest builder of nuclear reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
