The British Treasury plans to stop
airlines, retailers and other companies from levying excessive
fees on customers paying with credit and bank cards by limiting
the amount they charge to the cost of the transaction.  Consumers “have the right to understand the charges they
may incur up front and not be hit through a hidden last-minute
payment surcharge,” Treasury minister Mark Hoban said in a
statement released by his office in London today.  The  Office of Fair Trading , the U.K.’s antitrust regulator,
said in June that the law should be changed. A three-month
investigation found evidence of “drip pricing” surcharges that
cost U.K. consumers 300 million pounds ($470 million) in 2009 in
the  airline industry  alone, the OFT said.  The Treasury will consult business and consumer groups and
plans to have legislation in place by the end of next year,
according to today’s statement.  Which? , a consumer-rights group, said in a statement that
the move will be a “huge victory” for shoppers and called on
companies to “be up front” about charges immediately and not
wait for legislation. Which? filed a so-called supercomplaint
with the OFT in March about the practice, singling out taxi
services and low-cost airlines as surchargers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
