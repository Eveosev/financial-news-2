Standard & Poor’s  downgraded four
Hungarian banks after lowering  Hungary ’s credit rating to non-
investment grade earlier this week.  The rating company cut  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , the nation’s largest
lender, and its core subsidiary OTP Mortgage Bank to BB+ and B,
respectively, from BBB- and A-3 and removed them from
CreditWatch negative, S&P said in a statement today. The outlook
on both banks is negative, it said.  Hungary lost its investment-grade rating at S&P on Dec. 22,
the second downgrade in a month, as a result of weakening policy
credibility and concern that oversight institutions are losing
independence, S&P said. The  International Monetary Fund  and
European Union suspended financial aid talks last week, accusing
the government of trying to rein in the central bank.  The decision “reflects the banks’ exposure to the
sovereign through the Hungarian bonds in their securities
portfolios, the deteriorating operating environment, and the
consequences of unfriendly measures the government has imposed
on the Hungarian banking system since 2010,” S&P said.  S&P cut the unsolicited public information ratings on K&H
Bank Zrt., a subsidiary of KBC Groep NV, to BBpi from BBB-pi and
revised the outlook on Magyar Takarekszovetkezeti Bank Zrt. to
negative from stable, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
