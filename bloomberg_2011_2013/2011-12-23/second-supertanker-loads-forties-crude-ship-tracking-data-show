A supertanker is loading North Sea
Forties crude at Hound Point,  Scotland , according to ship-
tracking data from AISLive Ltd. compiled by Bloomberg.  Eliza, a very large crude carrier, has been loading oil at
Hound Point, the terminal for Forties crude, since Dec. 21, the
data showed. The final destination of the tanker is not
available.  This is the second VLCC loading Forties in a month after
Alexander the Great, chartered by BP Plc, carried about 2
million barrels of the North Sea grade to  South Korea .  Forties is one of four used to price  Dated Brent , the
benchmark for more than half of the worldâ€™s oil, alongside
Brent, Oseberg and Ekofisk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
