China Investment Corp. , the
country’s sovereign wealth fund, will receive as much as $50
billion in additional funding, Reuters reported, citing two
people familiar with the matter.  Government agencies reached an agreement that will allocate
cash from  China ’s $3.2 trillion foreign exchange reserves each
year, and “chart the future” of domestic unit Central Huijin
Investment Ltd., Reuters said today, without giving details. CIC
declined to comment on the report when contacted by Bloomberg
News.  Chairman  Lou Jiwei  deployed almost all the fund’s cash last
year as an improving world economy prompted a 10 percent gain in
the MSCI World Index. Net income rose 24 percent while the
Beijing-based fund posted an 11.7 percent return on its overseas
investments, according to its July annual report.  CIC will receive additional funding annually based on its
performance in the previous year, according to a report by
Weekly on Stocks that was posted to websites including that of
the China Securities Journal and Sohu.com in June. The fund may
get $50 billion as the first batch of new capital this year, the
report said, without saying where it got the information.  CIC was set up in 2007 with an initial $200 billion of
capital from China’s  Finance Ministry .  --Zhang Dingmin. Editor: Nathaniel Espino, Linus Chua  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
