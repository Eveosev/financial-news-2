Billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, the
former owner of Russian fertilizer maker OAO  Uralkali (URKA) , bought a
controlling stake in the AS Monaco  soccer club , his press office
said by e-mail.  Rybolovlevâ€™s Monaco Sport Invest acquired a 67 percent take
and will invest at least 100 million euros ($130 million) into
the club during the next four years, according to the statement.
Association Sportive de Monaco Football Club will keep a 33
percent stake in the club. A new board of directors for the
football club was approved today, according to the statement.  Rybolovlev sold his controlling stake in Uralkali in 2010
to investors led by billionaire Suleiman Kerimov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
