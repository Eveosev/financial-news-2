Canada ’s currency rose to its
strongest in more than a week versus the dollar after reports
showed the economic recovery gaining momentum for the nation’s
largest trading partner.  The loonie, as the currency is known, gained for a fourth
day before a report forecast to show the nation’s economy
expanded in October. The currency was also supported as crude
 oil prices  headed for the biggest weekly gain in almost two
months and global equity prices rose.  “In terms of regional growth, the fact that  North America 
is the less tarnished button is supportive,” said  Stewart Hall ,
senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto.
“There is some room that you see Canada be one of the better
performing currencies in 2012 based on those broad themes.”  Canada’s currency rose 0.2 percent to C$1.0187 at 7:43 a.m.
Toronto time, after earlier reaching C$1.0184, the strongest
level since Dec. 12. One Canadian dollar buys 98.16 U.S. cents.
The currency headed for its biggest weekly gain in three weeks.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500  rose 0.5 percent and
 contracts  for the S&P/TSX Composite Index gaining 0.7 percent.
Crude oil futures in New York headed for its biggest gain since
the week ended Oct. 28. Canada’s largest export rose 0.2 percent
to $99.70 a barrel and headed for a 6.7 percent advance on the
week.  Global risk appetite was buoyed after reports yesterday
showed U.S. initial  jobless claims  dropped to the lowest level
since April 2008 and leading indicators climbed more than
forecast in November. Canada’s gross domestic product grew 2.7
percent annualized pace in October, according to the median
estimate of a Bloomberg News survey, before the report due at
8:30 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
