Aluminum and copper traders probably
closed out bets that metal prices will fall as the number of
outstanding contracts declined while prices gained.  Open interest  in London Metal Exchange aluminum futures
fell by 143,279 contracts to 1.45 million lots in the week ended
Dec. 21, according to bourse figures. Aluminum for three-month
delivery, the benchmark contract, rose 1.6 percent in that
period. Open interest rose to a record 1.6 million lots on Dec.
16.  Open interest in copper futures fell by 27,050 contracts to
468,842 lots while prices gained 3.4 percent on the LME. Each
contract represents 25 metric tons of the metal.  Falling open interest and higher prices suggest short
covering, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. Short covering
denotes purchases to close out bets on lower prices.  Following are changes to market open interest for LME
members and clients compiled by the exchange for the six biggest
industrial-metals futures traded on the bourse in the week ended
Dec. 21, along with price movements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
