Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil company, confirmed the source of what could be
Nigeria’s worst offshore spill in more than a decade to a leak
in a flexible export line to a tanker.  Cleanup operations continued to the leak in the line
between the tanker and production facility, The Hague-based
Shell said in an  update  on its website. The company shut its
200,000 barrel-a-day Bonga offshore field after it leaked less
than 40,000 barrels earlier this week.  “The sheen has thinned considerably due to a combination
of natural factors and dispersant application, and in places is
breaking up, all of which should aid further dissipation,”
Mutiu Sunmonu, Shell’s chairman for Nigeria, said in the
statement late yesterday.  The Anglo-Dutch company deployed five ships to spray
dispersants and brought experts in to fight the spill.  Bonga ,
 Nigeria ’s first deepwater discovery, produces almost 10 percent
of the country’s crude, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) off the
coast.  The leak could be the country’s worst since a January 1998
Exxon Mobil Corp. spill dumped an estimated 40,000 barrels into
the sea from the Idoho platform on the southeastern coast, with
slicks reported as far west as Lagos.  Shell had planned to export five cargoes of 1 million
barrels each of Bonga crude a month from December to February,
loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News show.  The damaged export line was isolated three days ago and the
facility remains closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
