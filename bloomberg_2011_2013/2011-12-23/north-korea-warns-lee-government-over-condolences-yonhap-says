North Korea  said its relationship
with  South Korea  is at a crossroads and could break down
completely depending on the Lee Myung Bak administration’s
attitude to condolences to the late  Kim Jong Il , Yonhap News
reported, citing a North Korean website.  North Korea is open to all condolence messages and visits
from South Korea following Kim’s death and took steps to open
air routes and a land corridor via the Gaeseong joint industrial
zone, Yonhap said, citing Uriminzokkiri, a website run by the
North’s state-run Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of
Korea.  South Korea’s government on Dec. 20 expressed “sympathy”
to the people of North Korea while stopping short of sending an
official delegation to offer its communist neighbor condolences.
It said it would allow private visits by the wife of late
President Kim Dae Jung and family members of the late founder of
the  Hyundai Group , Chung Ju Yung.  Private individuals and groups, who are banned by South
Korean law from praising the North Korean regime, will be
allowed to send their condolences via mail or fax over the death
of Kim.  Uriminzokkiri said the South Korean government must
consider the impact of condolence visits on the future of inter-
Korean relations, according to the Yonhap report.  The Unification Ministry in Seoul said today it hasn’t
changed its position on condolence visits. The government has
approved 18 requests to send condolence messages after receiving
32 applications, said Choi Boh Seon, a spokesman for the
ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
