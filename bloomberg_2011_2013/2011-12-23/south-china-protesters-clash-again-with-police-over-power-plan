Police fired teargas at protesters
in southern  China  for a second day after the villagers refused
to end demonstrations against the construction of a power plant.  About 500 people from the town of Haimen gathered on a
highway in the fourth day of protests over the plant, which they
say is hurting people’s health and killing fish in nearby
waters, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  Police fired teargas at the protesters when they refused to
disperse,  Radio Television Hong Kong  reported. The protesters
said they would continue their demonstrations until police
release those in detention, RTHK reported.  Police detained five people earlier this week for alleged
vandalism, Xinhua said yesterday. Officials from the nearby city
of Shantou said Dec. 20 that the project will be suspended,
Xinhua said.  Video carried yesterday by  Hong Kong  Cable TV showed dozens
of police wearing helmets and holding shields facing protesters
and shooting teargas at them.  Government officials in  Guangdong province  reached an
agreement earlier this week to end a two-week protest by another
village in the region. A land dispute sparked demonstrations in
Wukan, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southwest of Haimen,
forced local officials to flee the village.  Two calls to the mobile phone of the director Shantou’s
government media office rang unanswered today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
