Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts rose after consumer-price growth
unexpectedly quickened in December, fueling speculation above-
target inflation will prompt the central bank to shorten its
cycle of interest-rate cuts.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.05 percent at
9:46 a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real erased its weekly loss, rising
0.4 percent to 1.8479 per dollar, from 1.8560 yesterday.  Futures yields rose, after climbing the most in almost
three months yesterday, after a report showed inflation
unexpectedly quickened in the 30 days through Dec. 22. The
report bolstered bets on fewer rate cuts after the central bank
said yesterday inflation would exceed its 4.5 percent target in
both 2012 and 2013.  “The market is repricing the size of the rate-cut cycle,”
Eduardo Castro, director of investments at Santander Asset
Management, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “Two
more 50 basis-point cuts is becoming the consensus in the
market.”  Prices as measured by the IPC-S index climbed 0.78 percent
in the 30 days through Dec. 22, from 0.72 percent in the
previous period, according to a report today from the Rio de
Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas Foundation. Inflation was expected
to slow to 0.7 percent, according to the median estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  -- Editor: Jessica Brice  To contact the reporters on this story:
