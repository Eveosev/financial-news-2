Cencosud (CENCOSUD)  SA, Chile’s largest
retailer by sales, is in talks with Brazilian lender  Banco
Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  to expand their credit-card partnership, Pulso wrote
today.  Cencosud’s branded credit cards are already administered by
Bradesco in Brazil and the companies are in discussions to
expand the alliance to Argentina and Chile, the Santiago-based
newspaper wrote, citing unidentified people close to the
negotiations. Cencosud’s operations in Colombia and Peru won’t
be included in the partnership, Pulso said.  Bradesco would provide funding for the credit card
operations, allowing Cencosud to allocate funds to other
investments, Pulso wrote.  An external public relations officer at Cencosud said in an
e-mail to Bloomberg News that the company wouldn’t comment on
the report. Bradesco declined to comment in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
