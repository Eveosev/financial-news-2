Brazilian real-estate firm  Tecnisa
SA  advanced after a stake sale in its Windsor Investimentos
Imobiliarios Ltda. subsidiary boosted the unit’s valuation.  The stock rose 0.4 percent to 10.05 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, trimming an earlier surge of as much as 6.5 percent.  The company, in a filing today, said it sold a 6.25 percent
stake in Windsor, which owns property in Sao Paulo, to BV
Empreendimentos & Participacoes SA for 50 million reais ($27
million), implying a value of 800 million reais for the unit. In
2008, Tecnisa  sold  25 percent of Windsor for 65.5 million reais,
which valued the unit at 262.2 million reais. That’s a threefold
jump.  “It’s a big appreciation,” Wesley Bernabe, an analyst at
 Banco do Brasil SA , said in a telephone interview from  Sao
Paulo . “And it doesn’t impact control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
