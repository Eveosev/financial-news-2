Kenya ’s shilling, the currency of
 East Africa ’s biggest economy, appreciated for the first time in
three days, bringing the currency to its ninth weekly gain.  The Kenyan shilling gained 0.1 percent to 83.60 at 6:10
p.m. in Nairobi, making it the best performer among more than
170 currencies on Bloomberg in the second half of this year,
gaining 6.9 percent against the dollar. Kenya’s currency has
weakened 3.5 percent for the year.  The Tanzanian shilling weakened as businesses stockpile
dollars on expectations the U.S. currency may become more
expensive after the holiday break.  Tanzania’s shilling depreciated 0.2 percent to 1,590 per
dollar at 6:10 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital.  “Commercial banks are demanding dollars to secure their
position ahead of the Christmas holiday, which caused the
shilling to depreciate,” Fred Siwale, a trader with CRDB Bank
Plc, said today by phone from  Dar es Salaam .  Uganda ’s currency slumped for the third day, the longest
losing streak in four weeks, retreating 1.2 percent to 2,448.01
by 6:12 p.m. in Kampala, the capital.  “The shilling is weakening because of reduced dollar
inflows from offshore investors because yields for the last
Treasury bill auction weren’t attractive,” Timothy Muzoora, a
currency trader at Cairo International Bank Ltd., said by phone
from Kampala. “Offshore investors have started withdrawing
their dollars because of the falling yield.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
