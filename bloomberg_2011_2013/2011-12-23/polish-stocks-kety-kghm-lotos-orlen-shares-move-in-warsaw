Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  gained 20.42,
or 1 percent, to 2,168.83 at the close in Warsaw, trimming this
year’s decline to 21 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Grupa Kety SA (KTY)   gained for a fourth day, adding 2
percent to 102 zloty. Poland’s biggest aluminum products maker
forecasts fourth-quarter net income of 22 million zloty ($6.5
million) and sales of 385 million zloty. The company posted a
profit of 18.2 million zloty a year ago.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, climbed 0.9 percent to 115 zloty,
its fourth day of gains. Copper rose on speculation signs of
growth in the U.S. will support demand for industrial metals.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , Poland’s second-largest refiner,
added 1.8 percent to 23 zloty, climbing for a second day as
crude oil advanced, heading for its biggest weekly increase in
almost two months.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL)  , controlled by Banco Comercial
Portugues SA, rose 6.2 percent to 3.43 zloty, rebounding from
the lowest level in more than two years. Fitch Ratings affirmed
its long-term issuer default rating of BBB- for the bank, it
said in a statement yesterday.  Separately, the stock’s 14-day relative strength index,
which shows how rapidly prices advanced or dropped during a
specified time period, was at 31.1 yesterday. A reading of 30 or
below signals to some investors that shares are set to rise.  To contact the reporters on this story:
