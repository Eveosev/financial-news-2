Banks led  Nigeria ’s benchmark stock
index for a sixth day of gains, the longest winning streak in
more than eight months, as investors bet companies will pay good
dividends this year, Mega Equities Limited said.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index gained 0.4
percent to 20,689.52 by the 12:30 p.m. close in Lagos, reducing
its loss for the year to 16 percent. Trading ended two hours
earlier today because of the Christmas holiday.  “The rise has to do with year-end valuations as people
take positions for likely dividend payments early in the new
year,” Samuel Onukwue, managing director of Lagos-based Mega
Equities, said by phone today.  United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , a lender with operations in 19
African countries, soared by the maximum daily limit of 5
percent to 2.73 naira, the highest in almost nine months.
 Sterling Bank Plc (STERLNBA) , who bought privately-held Equitorial Trust
Bank Limited, also surged 5 percent to 1.05 naira, the biggest
daily jump in almost three months.  Japaul Oil & Maritime
Services Plc , a marine offshore construction and equipment
leasing company, gained 5 percent to 84 kobo, the steepest rise
since Mar. 11.  Livestock Feeds Plc (LIVESTOC)  also increased by 5 percent
to 63 kobo, the maximum since Feb. 7.  A debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 threatened the Nigerian
banking system, prompting the central bank to fire eight chief
executives of the country’s 24 lenders and set up the Asset
Management Corp. of Nigeria, or Amcon, to buy bad debts and
stabilize the industry. Amcon has acquired 3.14 trillion naira
($19 billion) worth of debts, Chief Executive Officer Mustafa
Chike-Obi said Nov. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
