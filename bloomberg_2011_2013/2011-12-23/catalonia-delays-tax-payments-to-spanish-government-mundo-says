Spain â€™s Catalonia region is
postponing income tax and social security payments for its
workers because of a liquidity squeeze,  El Mundo  reported,
citing people in the regional government.  The Barcelona-based administration agreed with the central
government to pay in January the income tax due in November and
December, and also plans to postpone social security payments,
the newspaper said.  An official at the regional government, who declined to be
named in line with policy, said the administration was still
negotiating the postponement of the social security payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
