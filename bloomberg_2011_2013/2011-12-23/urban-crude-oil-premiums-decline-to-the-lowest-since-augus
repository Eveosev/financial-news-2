The premiums for Middle East crude
for sale to  Asia  fell against benchmark prices as refining
profits weakened.  Murban , produced in  Abu Dhabi , fell 3 cents a barrel to 11
cents below its official selling price today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest since August. The grade
was at a 3 cent premium on Dec. 16.  Qatar Land  slid 3 cents to a
discount of 23 cents a barrel to the official price, the deepest
since Sept. 1, the data show.  The value of crude such as Murban, which has a high yield
of middle distillates including gasoil and kerosene, has been
falling as processing profits have declined.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude is set to
narrow for the fifth week in six. This crack spread rose 31
cents to $18 a barrel on Friday, according to PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a London-based broker. That compares to $20.95 on Nov. 16,
the highest in the last six months.  The January Dubai swaps premium to March narrowed 3 cents
to $1.05 a barrel, according to data from PVM. The difference
was at $2.65 on Dec. 6. This market situation known as
backwardation suggests demand is greater for immediate
shipments. A decline in the level shows that the need for
cargoes has lessened.  Oman  crude fell 0.4 percent to $107.25 a barrel, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Dubai  dropped 0.4 percent to $106.
 Murban crude  was down 0.4 percent to $111.24.  Oman futures for February delivery increased 45 cents to
$107.85 a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 4:51 p.m.
Singapore time with 1,483 contracts traded. The settlement price
was $107.88 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The February  Brent-Dubai  exchange for swaps, which measures
the European benchmark contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
narrowed by 12 cents cents to $3.85 a barrel, according to data
from PVM. The exchange for swaps for March fell 5 cents to
$3.48.  To contact the reporter on this story:
