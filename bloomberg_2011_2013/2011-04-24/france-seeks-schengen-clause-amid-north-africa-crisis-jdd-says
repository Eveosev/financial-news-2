France  will seek a new clause in
the Schengen convention to allow member states to close borders
temporarily to block a rush of immigrants fleeing unrest in
North Africa,  Journal du Dimanche  reported citing an interview
with European Affairs Minister Laurent Wauquiez.  France will consider restoring border controls in case of a
massive influx, Wauquiez was quoted as saying. He ruled out the
possibility that the country would withdraw from the treaty,
which creates a borderless zone in Western Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
