(Corrects Saudi output targets in headline and first
paragraph.)  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest
oil producer, expects production to reach an average of 8.7
million barrels a day by 2015, the country’s OPEC governor said.  Average crude output will rise to 10.8 million barrels a
day by 2030 as long as supplies from other nations don’t
fluctuate sharply, Majid al-Moneef said in a report posted on
the website of Arab Energy Club. This level of production will
allow the kingdom to maintain total capacity at 12.5 million
barrels, he said.  The country’s upstream investments in recent years are
sufficient “to meet both export and local demand requirements
while keeping a high spare capacity reaching 1.7 million barrels
a day by 2030,” according to the report, entitled  ‘Saudi
Economy and the Future of Energy’  published on April 18. The
kingdom aims to maintain surplus production of 1.5 million to 2
million barrels a day.  Saudi Arabian output averaged 8.3 million barrels a day in
the past two decades, or 32 percent of shipments from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, he said. The
resumption of Iraqi supplies has lowered the kingdom’s share of
OPEC production to about 28 percent in the past five years, al-
Moneef said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
