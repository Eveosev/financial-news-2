U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  is close to signing a deal that will mean tens of
thousands of U.K. citizens pay tax on secret Swiss bank
accounts, the Sunday Times reported.  Dave Hartnett, head of HM Revenue & Customs, told tax
experts that the agreement between the U.K. and Switzerland will
be announced next month, while Swiss banks believe it will be
announced in the next two weeks, the newspaper said.  The U.K. government wouldnâ€™t comment on the agreement, the
Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
