Marylebone Warwick Balfour may sell
hotels valued at as much as 100 million pounds ($165 million) to
repay debt, the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  The property group may sell the freehold rights for the
Malmaison in  London  to an institutional investor, as well as
selling sites in Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle, the
newspaper said. A final decision has not been made on sales of
the regional properties, the Sunday Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
