Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  is manufacturing at
close to capacity in  Asia , NZZ am Sonntag reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Markus Akermann.  The cement maker will only benefit “on the margins” from
post-earthquake reconstruction in  Japan , the  newspaper  cited
Akermann as saying. Organic growth, for example in  developing
countries , is “more interesting” to Holcim than acquiring a
company in Japan, he said.  Holcim is the world’s second-biggest cement maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
