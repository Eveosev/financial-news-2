The world’s biggest bond dealers
dispute  Bill Gross ’s assertion that the $9.13 trillion market
for U.S. Treasuries offers little value.  While Gross, who runs Pacific Investment Management Co.’s
$236 billion Total Return Fund, is betting against government
debt, the 20 firms that trade with the  Federal Reserve  predict
yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note will hold below 4
percent for a third straight year for the balance of 2011.  “I could join the dealers and say the 10-year’s not going
to go to 4 percent, so what am I left with?” Gross said in a
telephone interview April 20. “I’m left with an under-yielding,
less-than-inflation security. I have better choices. As a firm
we’re not going to put up with it.”  So far, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG
and the rest of the primary dealers are proving right. U.S.
bonds of all maturities are generating their best returns since
August, gaining 0.49 percent this month. Optimism Congress will
cut spending, slower growth and rising demand from banks meeting
tighter risk standards governing the capital they must hold to
cushion against losses are supporting bond prices.  Yields on 10-year notes ended last week at 3.39 percent,
down from this year’s high of 3.77 percent on Feb. 9, even as
 Standard & Poor’s  cut its outlook for the U.S.’s top AAA credit
rating to “negative” from “stable.” S&P said the move
indicates a one-in-three chance of a downgrade.  ‘Significant Demand’  “What’s telling is the significant volume of buying when
10-year yields were above 3.50 percent and 30-year bond yields
were around 4.65 percent,” said  William O’Donnell , head U.S.
government bond strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , a primary dealer. “There’s still significant
demand for long-end Treasury paper at those levels and I don’t
think Bill Gross is going to make that demand disappear.”  Demand at Treasury auctions has risen to record levels this
year, with investors submitting $3 in orders for every $1 of
debt offered, data compiled by Bloomberg show. At this month’s
auctions of three-, 10- and 30-year bonds, the so-called bid-to-
cover ratio exceeded the average of the previous 10 sales.  RBS forecasts yields will fall to 3.25 percent by June 30,
before ending the year at 3.6 percent. Goldman Sachs, the most
accurate bond forecaster in the 13 quarters ended March 31 based
on data compiled by Bloomberg, sees them at 3.5 percent in June
and 3.75 percent in December.  ‘Easier’ Policy  “Increased downgrade risk doesn’t necessarily imply
increased Treasury yields,” Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius in  New York  wrote in an April 19 report. “A significant
push toward fiscal austerity would lead to lower growth and
lower growth would lead to easier monetary policy for longer.”  Fed policy makers, who meet this week, will likely keep
their target interest rate for overnight loans between banks in
a record low range of zero to 0.25 percent through year-end,
according to the median estimate of more than 75 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. A separate poll show the economists
reduced their 2011 growth estimates to 2.9 percent from 3.2
percent in February.  Ten-year yields fell almost two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, last week, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 3.625 percent security due February 2021 rose 3/32,
or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 101 28/32.  The yield fell one basis point to 3.39 percent today at
7:43 a.m. in New York.  Competing Proposals  The split between Gross and the dealers comes as President
 Barack Obama  and Republicans in Congress debate competing
proposals to reduce the $1.4 trillion  budget deficit .  Obama has proposed $4 trillion in spending cuts within 12
years through a combination of reduced expenditures and tax
increases. The Republican-controlled House passed a budget April
15 that would trim spending by more than $6 trillion over a
decade and slash government support of Medicare and Medicaid.  With the supply of marketable Treasuries outstanding having
more than doubled to $9.1 trillion since the start of the
financial crisis in August 2007, the political moves are so far
insufficient for Gross.  “This no Treasury thing is simply a demonstration of
vigilance on the part of Pimco that says these bonds aren’t
worth what others appear to think they’re worth, and we prefer
another menu, that’s all,” Gross said.  Eliminated Treasuries  Gross eliminated Treasuries from his fund in February and
then, in March, bet that the debt will lose value, according to
the firm’s holdings statement released April 11. The Total
Return Fund has averaged an 8.65 percent gain the past five
years, beating 99 percent of its peers, Bloomberg data show.  While Pimco’s $1.24 trillion in assets under management
commands the attention of investors, foreign central banks and
sovereign wealth funds exert a bigger day-to-day pull on
Treasury yields, said John Fath, who manages $2.5 billion at BTG
Pactual in New York.  “Gross’s point is well-taken and ultimately I think he
will be right,” said Fath, former head of Treasury trading at
primary dealer UBS AG. Even so, “if these guys are willing to
hold these securities at these levels, it’s going to be hard to
see rates go up,” he said in reference to overseas investors.  Foreign holdings of Treasuries jumped $36.4 billion to
$4.47 trillion in the first two months of the year, according to
the Treasury. U.S. financial markets should be stable over the
long term, even after S&P’s warning, Xia Bin, an adviser to the
Chinese central bank, said last week.  Increasing Holdings  Banks have increased their holdings of Treasuries and
agency securities by $49.1 billion to $1.67 trillion since the
end of last year, according to Fed data. The  Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision , appointed by the Swiss government, proposed
rules in October requiring banks to increase available capital
under the so-called Basel III rules.  While commercial and industrial loans rose to $1.25
trillion this month from $1.21 trillion in September, they
remain below the peak of $1.62 trillion in October 2008, Fed
data show.  Banks may boost their purchases as they reinvest the
proceeds of maturing loans and non-government bonds, according
to Laurence Fink, chairman and chief executive officer of New
York-based BlackRock Inc., which manages $3.65 trillion.  “Banks are going to have their C&I loans and their
structured bonds rolling off to the tune of $2 trillion,” Fink
said April 19 on Bloomberg Television’s InsideTrack with Erik Schatzker. “Banks may be a big buyer of Treasuries.”  End of QE2  The end of the Fed’s second-round of so-called quantitative
easing may not be enough to spark a sell-off. The $600 billion
bond-purchase program wraps up in June, and the Fed is likely to
signal at the conclusion of this week’s meeting it will continue
to reinvest the proceeds of maturing mortgage securities in
Treasuries, said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse.  “We do not view the end of QE2 as a reason for rates to
spike,” Nomura strategists led by  George Goncalves  wrote in a
report published April 19. “If the markets behave according to
prior QE experience, we should see the curve flatten and rates
stay in check.”  A flatter yield curve would mean a smaller difference
between short- and long-term bond rates. Ten-year notes yield
2.73 percentage points more than two-year securities, compared
with the mean of 1.16 percentage points since 1991.  In its first round of bond purchases the Fed bought $1.7
trillion of mortgage and Treasury securities in 2009 and the
first quarter of 2010. Within three months of that program
ending, 10-year yields fell to 2.93 percent from 3.83 percent.  HSBC Holdings Plc has the most bullish year-end yield
forecast among the primary dealers at 3.4 percent, followed by
 Societe Generale  at 3.5 percent, according to a survey by
Bloomberg News. Jefferies Group Inc. has the most bearish call
at 5 percent, followed by BNP Paribas’ 4.25 percent.  *T Primary Dealer Forecasts for 10-Year Yields  Firm                June 30        Dec. 31
