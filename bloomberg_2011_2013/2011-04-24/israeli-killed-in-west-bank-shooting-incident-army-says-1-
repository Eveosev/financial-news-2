A Palestinian policeman in the  West
Bank  killed an Israeli civilian and wounded four others today
after opening fire at a “suspicious movement,” the Israeli
Army Spokesman’s Office said in an e-mailed statement.  Palestinian officials informed the Israeli army of the
shooting and the two sides will hold a meeting to investigate
the incident later today, according to the statement. The
Israelis entered the Palestinian city of Nablus to visit
Joseph’s Tomb, a Jewish holy site, without coordinating with
their army as required by law, according to the statement.  The shooting came amid rising tensions in the West Bank
following the stabbing to death in March of an Israeli family in
their Jewish settlement home. Two Palestinians have been
arrested in connection with that attack. After the funeral,
Jewish settlers and Palestinians threw stones at one another
near the West Bank town of Hawara and a Palestinian car was
torched, an army spokeswoman said, speaking anonymously
according to regulations.  The casualty of today’s shooting was the nephew of Israeli
Minister of Culture and Sport Limor Livnat, a member of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, said Or Doron, a
ministry spokeswoman.  Defense Minister  Ehud Barak  condemned the shooting, calling
on the  Palestinian Authority  to investigate the incident.  “A slip-up in security coordination can’t justify an
incident like this,” Barak said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
