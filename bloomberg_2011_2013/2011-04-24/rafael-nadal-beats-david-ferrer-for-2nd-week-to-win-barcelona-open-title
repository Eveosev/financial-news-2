World No. 1 Rafael Nadal beat
fellow Spaniard  David Ferrer  in a tournament final for a second
straight week, winning 6-2, 6-4 today at the Barcelona Open.  Nadal, 24, who takes the title for a sixth time in seven
years, has now notched 501 career victories and is on a 34-match
unbeaten run on clay. He clinched a record seventh consecutive
Monte Carlo Masters tennis title last week.  Nadal had three breaks in the opening set to one for
Ferrer, who then appeared in control in the second after winning
four successive games for a 4-2 lead.  After breaking back in the next game, Nadal managed to hold
in a lengthy eighth game before taking the next two comfortably
to complete victory.  Nadal now leads Ferrer, who is sixth in the ATP World Tour
 rankings , 13-4 in career meetings. He’d won seven straight
matches against Ferrer before his defeat in the Australian Open
quarterfinals in Melbourne in January.  The reigning champion at the  French Open  will be aiming to
win a sixth title at  Roland Garros  starting next month.  Elsewhere, Germany’s Julia Goerges defeated top-ranked
Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark in the final of the Porsche Grand
Prix in Stuttgart. Georges won 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 to claim her
second WTA Tour title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
