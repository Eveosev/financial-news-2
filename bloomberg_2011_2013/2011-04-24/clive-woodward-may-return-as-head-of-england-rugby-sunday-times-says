England ’s Rugby Football Union
denied it’s set to appoint Clive Woodward as its performance
director, following a Sunday Times report that the coach who led
the nation to World Cup victory in 2003 is about to get the job.  In the newly created post, Woodward would take charge of
all England rugby teams, the newspaper said, without saying
where it got the information. It said he hadn’t applied for the
role but would be approached as he appeared to be the “only
serious candidate.”  The RFU said such reports are “incorrect and are based on
rumor and speculation, not fact.” Candidates were invited to
apply, it said in an e-mailed statement.  “We are pleased to say they did so and we have a strong
short list who will go forward to the next stage but we will not
comment on any individual people who may or may not have applied
for the role as it remains a confidential process,” the RFU
said.  The ruling body said it expects to make an announcement on
the appointment by the end of May at the latest.  The job carries an annual salary of about 330,000 pounds
($545,000) the Sunday Times reported. The role entails being in
charge of the whole national coaching structure, including
appointment of the head coach, in the buildup to the 2015  World
Cup  to be staged in England, it added.  Woodward, 55, is currently director of elite performance at
the  British Olympic Association , with the summer Games to be
staged in  London  next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
