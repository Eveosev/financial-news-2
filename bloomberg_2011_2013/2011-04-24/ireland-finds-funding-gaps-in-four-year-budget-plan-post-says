Ireland’s seven-week-old government
has found funding gaps in a four-year budget plan drawn up by
the country’s previous administration, the  Sunday Business Post 
reported, citing two cabinet ministers.  There’s a shortfall of as much as 140 million euros ($204
million) in this year’s budget for the Department of Social
Protection, while road maintenance will cost double the original
100 million-euro estimate, the newspaper said.  The government will have to make deeper budgetary cuts to
cover the funding shortfalls in order to keep overall spending
within the terms of Ireland’s international bailout accord,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
