Saudi Arabia , holder of the world’s
largest crude oil reserves, has no plans to raise production
capacity beyond 12.5 million barrels a day, a Saudi Arabian oil
official said.  Reports that the country may boost its output capacity to
15 million barrels a day aren’t true, the official said by
telephone today, declining to be identified by name because he
isn’t authorized to speak publicly.  Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a trade publication,
reported on April 22 that the kingdom is considering raising
capacity to 15 million barrels a day, without citing anyone.
Saudi Arabia’s OPEC Governor  Majid al-Moneef  said in a report on
April 18 that the country will keep capacity at 12.5 million
barrels a day for the next two decades.  At an emergency oil summit that Saudi ruler King Abdullah
convened in the port city of Jeddah in June 2008, the government
said it could raise output capacity by an additional 2.5 million
barrels a day, if needed, by developing untapped giant fields.  To contact the reporters on this story:
