Codelco, the worldâ€™s largest copper
producer, plans to buy or explore for new mines outside of
Chile, La Tercera reported.  Diego Hernandez , chief executive officer of the state-owned
company, said he formed a unit that will begin exploring for new
mines in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador, the newspaper reported.  Codelco is interested in medium or small mines and will
seek private investors to help fund the expansion, La Tercera
said, citing Hernandez. Codelco eventually wants to search for
mines in Africa, Hernandez told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
