Moroccans calling for faster
democratic change took to the streets today in the country’s
biggest cities, echoing demands that have spread from North
Africa to  Yemen .  The non-violent demonstrations in Casablanca, Fes, Rabat
and Marrakech followed last month’s pledge by King Mohammed VI
to introduce more liberties, with some protesters demanding the
dissolution of the government and greater involvement in
rewriting the constitution.  “I am marching because we are not a free people,” said
Madmad Thahani, a 20-year-old student in Casablanca. “We demand
the dissolution of the committee appointed by the King because
its members weren’t chosen by the people.”  The revolutionary contagion in the Arab world toppled
governments in Egypt and  Tunisia  and may push Yemen’s leader out
of power. Demonstrations in  Morocco  began Feb. 20, aiming to
reduce the king’s power, curb corruption and end police
brutality.  “Corruption must end and we demand a progressive
country,” said Abdelfetah Bahjadi, another protester. “This is
the people speaking to get its dignity back.”  In a March 9 address, King Mohammed announced his intent to
make “progress in democracy.”  He vowed more religious freedom,
more transparent justice, and a prime minister coming from an
elected party. He appointed a commission to review the
constitution by June and promised a subsequent referendum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
