Winfried Kretschmann, the Green
Party leader poised to become Baden-Wuerttemberg’s next prime
minister, said  Germany  should reduce the number of cars and
build vehicles that consume less fuel,  Bild am Sonntag  reported.  “Fewer cars are of course better than more,” Kretschmann
told the German newspaper. “We want to export green products
and services,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
