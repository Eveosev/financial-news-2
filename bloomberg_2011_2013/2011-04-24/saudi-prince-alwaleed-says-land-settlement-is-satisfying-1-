Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the
Saudi billionaire who controls investment company  Kingdom
Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , said the agreement it reached with  Egypt  over
contested land in the country was “satisfying.”  The Riyadh-based company’s Egyptian investments won’t be
affected by the dispute, Prince Alwaleed told reporters in
 Kuwait  today.  Kingdom Holding reached an initial agreement with the
Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture over the 100,000 feddans
(103,800 acres) of land it owns in Toskha in southern Egypt, it
said in an announcement to the  Saudi bourse  today. The company’s
 Kingdom Agricultural Development Co.  unit would give up 75,000
feddans to Egypt, own 10,000 feddans and lease 15,000 feddans,
Kingdom said.  Ahmad Halwani, Kingdom Holding’s executive director for
private equity and international investments, said yesterday
that “such a settlement guarantees all rights of Kingdom
Agricultural.” The agreement “will not adversely impact the
shareholders of Kingdom Holding Co.,” he said in an e-mailed
statement.  The disputed land is part of the Toshka development
project, which plans to use water diverted by a canal from the
Aswan High Dam reservoir to reclaim land in Egypt’s western
desert. Kingdom’s acquisition was criticised after the revolt
that ended the 30-year rule of President  Hosni Mubarak .  To contact the reporters on this story:
