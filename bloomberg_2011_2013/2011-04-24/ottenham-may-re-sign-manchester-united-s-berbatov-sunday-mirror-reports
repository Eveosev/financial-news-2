Tottenham may attempt to re-sign
Dimitar Berbatov from  Manchester United  if the striker fails to
agree to a new contract, the  Sunday Mirror reported , without
saying where it got the information.  The 30-year-old is likely to be offered only a one-year
extension and if he does not sign will be sold this summer
rather than allowed to leave on a free transfer when his
contract expires in 2012, the newspaper said.  Tottenham, which sold Berbatov to United for about 30
million pounds ($49.5 million) three years ago, is prepared to
pay up to 8 million pounds to bring the Bulgarian back to White
Hart Lane, the Mirror reported.  Spurs manager Harry Redknapp is also interested in Aston
Villa’s Ashley Young and Napoli’s Edinson Cavani, although the
size of the club’s transfer budget will be decided by whether it
qualifies for the Champions League, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
