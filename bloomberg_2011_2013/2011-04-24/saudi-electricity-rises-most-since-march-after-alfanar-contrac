Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO) , the state-
controlled power producer, advanced the most in more than a
month after it awarded two contracts valued at 1.9 billion
riyals ($507 million) to Alfanar Construction Co.  The shares advanced 5 percent, the most since March 5, to
13.7 riyals at the 3:30 p.m. close in  Riyadh , paring the drop
for the year to 2.5 percent.  The contracts are to reinforce a power plant and build
railway substations. Alfanar will add 280 megawatts to a power
plant extension in Hail, the Riyadh-based contractor said in an
e-mailed statement today. The project will start operations in
August 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
