Paris Saint-Germain missed the
chance to go third in French soccer’s top league when it drew 2-
2 at Brest yesterday.  PSG took the lead through Mathieu Bodmer before Brest
rallied to go 2-1 ahead with goals by Larsen Toure and Bruno
Grougi. An own goal by Ahmed Kantari three minutes from time
gave the visitors a draw.  Lille has 60 points and Marseille 58. Lyon and PSG have 53,
with Lyon having the better goal difference. Lille drew 1-1 at
Lorient in yesterday’s late game, and the Lyon-Montpellier and
Marseille-Nice matches take place in two days.  Marseille two days ago beat Montpellier 1-0 in the League
Cup final to retain the trophy, thanks to a goal from Taye
Taiwo.  Lionel Messi  two days ago became the first player to score
50 goals in a Spanish season as he and  David Villa  were on the
mark in league leader Barcelona’s 2-0 win over Osasuna.  Real Madrid stays eight points behind after a 6-3 victory
at third-placed Valencia, including three goals by  Gonzalo Higuain . Valencia is now 17 points behind Real.  Villarreal remains fourth on 57 points after a 3-2 loss to
Sevilla in yesterday’s late game. Athletic Bilbao has 51 and
Atletico Madrid 49 after yesterday’s 4-1 win over Levante.  AC Milan extended its lead to eight points in  Italy ’s Serie
A after a 1-0 win at Brescia two days ago, Robinho scoring in
the 82nd minute. Inter Milan moved into second with a 2-1 home
win over Lazio. Napoli, a point behind, lost 2-1 at Palermo.  Borussia Dortmund  saw its lead in  Germany  cut to five
points after a surprise 1-0 loss two days ago at Borussia
Moenchengladbach, which moved off the bottom of the table.
Mohamadou Idrissou got the winning goal in the 35th minute.  Bayer Leverkusen , in second place, had a 2-1 home victory
over Hoffenheim.  In the Netherlands, Feyenoord got revenge for its club-
record 10-0 drubbing at PSV Eindhoven in October by winning the
home game 3-1 yesterday.  FC Twente, a 2-1 winner at Den Haag three days ago, leads
on 68 points, with Ajax on 67 and PSV on 65. Ajax beat Excelsior
4-1 yesterday.  WEEKEND RESULTS
