The European Investment Bank is
making "unreasonable" demands on a finance plan for Saab
Automobile,  Dagens Industri  reported, citing Lars Carlstrom, a
spokesman for Russian billionaire  Vladimir Antonov .   Saab, which has been forced to halt production amid a
payment dispute with suppliers, will not be able to complete the
transaction, which includes Antonov buying certain Saab
properties, unless the bank changes its demands, Stockholm-based
Dagens Industri quoted Carlstrom as saying.   Carlstrom declined to elaborate on the bank’s demands,
Dagens Industri said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
