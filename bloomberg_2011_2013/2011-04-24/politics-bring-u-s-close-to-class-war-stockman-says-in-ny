Bipartisan politics are bringing
the U.S. close to class war and deepening the fiscal stalemate,
 David Stockman  wrote in an op-ed article published in today’s
New York Times.  The fiscal condition of the U.S. requires higher taxes on
the middle class, not just the richest two percent, and
entitlement reform requires means-testing Social Security and
Medicare programs, not just squeezing smaller areas like
Medicaid and food stamps, Stockman wrote.  President  Barack Obama  has denied the first point while
Representative Paul D. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget
Committee, contradicted the second by putting the entire burden
of entitlement reform on the poor, according to Stockman.  “The Ryan plan worsens our trillion-dollar structural
deficit and the Obama plan amounts to small potatoes, at best,”
Stockman wrote. “The global  bond market  is already rumbling --
and around the corner, a fiscal conflagration surely lies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
