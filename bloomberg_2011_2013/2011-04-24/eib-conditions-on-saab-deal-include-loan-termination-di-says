The  European Investment Bank  wants
to terminate a 3.6 billion kronor ($590 million) loan to Saab
Automobile as a condition of approving a new financing plan for
the Swedish automaker,  Dagens Industri  reported today, citing an
unnamed person close to Saab.   The condition to terminate the loan within 90 days after
the financing plan comes into effect is unacceptable to Saab,
Stockholm-based Dagens Industri reported, citing the unnamed
person.   The EIB gave notice on the plan to Saab on Thursday, and
now "the ball is in GM’s court," Dagens Industri quoted Eva
Srejber, EIB spokeswoman, as saying. Srejber wouldn’t comment on
whether the bank approved Saab’s financing plan and wouldn’t
provide any more details, the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
