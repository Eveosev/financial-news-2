The  Boston Celtics  beat the New
York Knicks 101-89 to sweep their National Basketball
Association playoff series.  The 4-0 series defeat means the Knicks, who returned to the
postseason for the first time in seven years, are still without
a playoff win since April 29, 2001.  Also today, the  Philadelphia 76ers  avoided a series sweep
with an 86-82 home win against the Miami Heat. Trailing 3-1 in
games in the Eastern Conference series, the 76ers head back to
Miami for Game 5 on April 27.  In other games today, the Atlanta Hawks and the defending
champion Los Angeles Lakers will seek to take 3-1 leads against
the Orlando Magic and New Orleans Hornets respectively.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
