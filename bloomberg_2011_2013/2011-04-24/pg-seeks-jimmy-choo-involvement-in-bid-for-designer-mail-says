TPG Capital has held talks with
designer  Jimmy Choo  seeking his involvement in a bid for the
fashion group he founded, the  Mail on Sunday  reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  TPG is one of three parties to have made an opening 500
million pound ($825 million) bid for Jimmy Choo Ltd., the
newspaper said.  Jones Group Inc. (JNY)  is thought to have bid as well,
the Mail on Sunday said.  Owen Blicksilver, a TPG spokesman, didnâ€™t immediately
respond to an e-mail outside of business hours seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
