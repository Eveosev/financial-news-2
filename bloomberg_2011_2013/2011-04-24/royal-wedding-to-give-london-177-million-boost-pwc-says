Spending by visitors to  London  for
the April 29 wedding of Prince William and  Kate Middleton  will
have a “commercial benefit” of 107 million pounds ($177
million), according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP survey.  PwC forecast that 560,000 people will travel to London from
other parts of the U.K. and that 550,000 people will head for
the Westminster area where the wedding is held, while nearly 1
million people will watch it on big screens.  “Our survey suggests that the wedding will be a great
economic boost for London’s economy and a good indicator of the
potential economic benefits of the Olympic games when more than
10 times this number of visitors is expected,” PwC economist
Mark Ambler said in a  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
