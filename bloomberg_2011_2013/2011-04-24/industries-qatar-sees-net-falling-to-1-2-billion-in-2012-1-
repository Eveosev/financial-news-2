Industries Qatar QSC (IQCD) , the Persian
Gulf nation’s largest company by market capitalization, said it
expects profit to fall 6 percent to 4.6 billion riyals ($1.2
billion) next year as it sets up new plants.  The company with stakes in petrochemicals, fertilizers and
steel manufacturing forecasts net income will drop from the 4.9
billion riyals budgeted for this year, before rising to 5
billion riyals in 2013, it said in an e-mailed statement today.
Revenue will climb to 15.3 billion riyals in 2012 and 16.8
billion riyals in 2013, from 14.5 billion riyals this year, the
company said.  Industries Qatar, the second-biggest petrochemicals company
in the Middle East, said it plans to start two fertilizer
plants, two steel plants and a polyethylene facility by 2015. It
forecasts depreciation costs will nearly double to a
“significant” 2.067 billion riyals by 2013, according to the
statement.  The Doha-based company is using Qatar’s natural gas
reserves, the world’s third-largest, to ramp up production as
demand grows in  Asia  and the Middle East for food, chemicals and
building materials. The emirate’s petrochemicals output will
rise to 28 million tons by 2014, former Energy Minister Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah said on May 4.  Industries Qatar said its QAFCO 5 and QAFCO 6 plants will
each open a quarter later than planned, in the third quarter of
this year and in the same period of 2012. The company’s
petrochemicals unit will begin operating a low-density
polyethylene plant, called LDPE 3, in the first quarter of 2012.  Industries Qatar said it plans “major shutdowns” in 2012
and 2013, including a 42-day outage at an ethylene plant in the
fourth quarter of next year, an 89-day closure of a methanol
plant in the first three months of 2013 and a 45-day shutdown of
its Ras Laffan ethane cracker in the final quarter of that year.  The company fell 0.7 percent to 146.5 riyals in Qatar
