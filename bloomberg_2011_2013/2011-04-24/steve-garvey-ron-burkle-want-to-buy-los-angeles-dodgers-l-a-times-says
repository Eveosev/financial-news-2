Former Dodgers first baseman Steve Garvey said he and billionaire  Ron Burkle  want to buy the Los
Angeles team, which was taken over last week by  Major League
Baseball , the Los Angeles Times reported.  “We want to bring the Dodgers back to their glory,”
Garvey, 62, told the newspaper. “There was a Dodger way, but
that way has drifted by the wayside.”  Burkle, 58, chairman of Los Angeles-based Yucaipa Cos.,
joined Mario Lemieux in buying the National Hockey League’s
Pittsburgh Penguins in 1999, the Times said. Burkle also has
shown an interest in buying the National Basketball
Association’s Sacramento Kings to keep the team from moving.  Billionaire developer Alan Casden, who tried to buy Dodgers
when the team was last for sale, and financier Alec Gores, whose
brother bought the NBA’s  Detroit Pistons  earlier this month,
also are said to be putting together bids for the team after MLB
took control out of concern for its rising debt, the Times
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
