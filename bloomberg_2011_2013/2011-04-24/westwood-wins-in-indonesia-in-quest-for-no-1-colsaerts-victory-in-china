England’s  Lee Westwood  scored a
final-round 69, 3-under par, to clinch a three-stroke win at the
Indonesian Masters on his 38th birthday and boost his chances of
regaining the world No. 1 golf ranking.  Westwood finished on 19-under-par 269 at the Royale Jakarta
Golf Club, Thailand’s Thongchai Jaidee coming second after a 65.  “This will definitely be the most memorable birthday for
me,” Westwood told reporters. “I’ve ticked every box this week
so we will have to wait and see what happens.”  Westwood, now ranked second behind  Martin Kaymer  of
 Germany , picked up a first prize of $119,000. He can reclaim the
world No. 1 spot if English countryman Luke Donald doesn’t win

field by a stroke.  There was a four-way tie for third in Indonesia between
Park Hyun-Bin of  South Korea , Thailand’s Thitiphun Chuayprakong,

round 66, 6-under par, for a 24-under total at the China Open
and a first victory in more than 10 years on the European Tour.
