Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the owner and
operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that exploded
last year, will pay shareholders $1 billion in dividends even
after the payout was blocked by a court ruling, the  Sunday Times 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Swiss authorities blocked the dividend in August because it
expected litigation, according to the report. Zug, Switzerland-
based Transocean plans to pay the dividend under a transaction
that doesnâ€™t require their approval, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
