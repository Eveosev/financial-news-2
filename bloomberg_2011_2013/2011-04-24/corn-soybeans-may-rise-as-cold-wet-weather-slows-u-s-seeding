Corn and soybeans may rise this
week as wet, cold weather in the U.S. Midwest threatens to delay
planting of the nation’s two biggest crops, eroding yield
prospects.  Twenty-four of 31 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to Chicago on April 21 said corn will rise, and 25 respondents
forecast a gain for soybeans. Last week on the Chicago Board of
Trade, corn futures for July delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
$7.445 a bushel, and soybean futures for July delivery rose 3.5
percent to $13.8975 a bushel.  Last week’s gain in soybeans was expected by the majority
of respondents surveyed on April 15, while the drop in corn was
a surprise. Since 2004, the surveys have been correct 55 percent
of the time for corn, and 53 percent for soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 24    Bullish on soybeans: 25
Bearish on corn:  7    Bearish on soybeans:  6  To contact the reporter on this story:
