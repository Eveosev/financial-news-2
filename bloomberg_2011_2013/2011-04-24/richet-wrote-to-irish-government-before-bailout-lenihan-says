European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  told the Irish government he was concerned
about money the nation’s banks owed the ECB before it applied
for a bailout in November, according to  Brian Lenihan , then
finance minister.  Trichet wrote to Lenihan on Nov. 12, and “raised the
question about whether Ireland would be participating in a
program,” Lenihan said in an interview aired today on BBC Radio
4. Ireland said on Nov. 21 it was applying for a rescue package.  Irish Central Bank Governor  Patrick Honohan , the first
official to publicly say, on Nov. 18, that Ireland needed a
rescue, said he was prompted to speak when “a friend texted me
around midnight the night before” saying that an editorial
would appear in the Financial Times “saying, effectively,
people should be planning on bank runs.” Honohan also spoke in
an interview aired by Radio 4 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
