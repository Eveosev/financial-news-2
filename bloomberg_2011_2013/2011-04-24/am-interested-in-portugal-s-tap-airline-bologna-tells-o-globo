Brazilian airline  Tam SA (TAMM4)  is
“tracking” the possible sale of Tap SGPS SA, Portugal’s state-
owned airline,  O Globo  newspaper reported, citing an interview
with Tam Chief Executive Officer Marco Antonio Bologna.  Tam is waiting for Portugal to announce the privatization
of the airline, Bologna told the paper. Tam is also interested
in investing in Brazilian airports, Bologna is cited as saying.  Chile’s antitrust tribunal must first approve a takeover of
the company by  Lan Airlines SA. (LAN)  Tam plans to buy shares from
minority investors who don’t approve the takeover, O Globo
reported, citing Bologna.  Lan said in August it planned to buy Tam for $3.9 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
