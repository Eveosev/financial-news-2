Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA) ’s head of
research Amer Halawi resigned last week for personal reasons,
the  United Arab Emirates ’ biggest investment bank said.  Walid Shihabi, who heads the brokerage unit, will oversee
the research division, the company said in a statement in
response to questions by Bloomberg News.  The departure of Halawi, who was appointed as managing
director and head of research at Shuaa on Sept. 1, follows the
resignation of the company’s Chief Financial Officer David Deards last month. Shuaa’s loss widened in the fourth quarter to
186.7 million dirhams ($51 million) from 154.3 million dirhams
in the year-earlier period. The shares have dropped 4 percent
this year.  Before Shuaa, Halawi held a position of managing director
at Abu Dhabi-based The National Investor, where he focused on
research, sales and trading, according to the appointment press
release last year. Halawi has held equity analyst positions at
UBS AG, BNP Paribas and HSBC Holdings Plc. He declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
