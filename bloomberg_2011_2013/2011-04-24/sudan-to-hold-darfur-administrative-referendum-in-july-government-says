Sudan  will conduct a referendum on
the administrative structure of the western region of  Darfur  in
July, the state-run SUNA news agency said today in a text
message.  Darfuris will vote in the referendum on whether to keep
Darfur divided into three states, or to combine them into one
region, presidential adviser Ghazi Salaheddine Atabani said last
month.  Darfur rebel groups reject the current division, and demand
the reunification of the region’s three states into one.  Sudan’s army has been fighting rebels in Darfur since 2003,
when insurgents took up arms, accusing the government of
neglecting the region.  The conflict has led to the deaths of as many as 300,000
people, mainly due to illness and starvation, and forced about
2.7 million to flee their homes, according to United Nations
estimates. The Sudanese government has put the death toll at
about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
