Medicare and Medicaid programs must
be part of the U.S. effort to reduce the  budget deficit , Senator
Tom Coburn said.  “You can’t have Medicare out of the equation,” Coburn, an
Oklahoma Republican and member of the Senate Budget Committee,
said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program broadcast today. “You
can’t have Medicaid out of the equation. To lead on this issue
and create a false predicate that says we can solve our problems
without addressing our entitlements hurts the country.”  As part of the debate on  government spending , which
includes completing a 2012 budget, President Barack Obama has
offered the outlines of a plan to reduce the debt by $4 trillion
over 12 years through a combination of spending cuts and tax
increases.  House Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan , a Wisconsin
Republican, has proposed cutting spending by $6 trillion over a
decade in part by privatizing Medicare and capping Medicaid
spending. Republicans reject Obama’s push for tax increases on
the wealthiest Americans to help reduce debt.  Senator  Kent Conrad , a North Dakota Democrat and chairman
of the budget committee, said on “Meet the Press” that the
U.S. is “headed for a fiscal cliff” if it doesn’t address the
deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
