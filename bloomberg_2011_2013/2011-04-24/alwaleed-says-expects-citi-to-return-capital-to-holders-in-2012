Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, is likely to step up efforts to return
capital to shareholders in 2012 after resuming dividend payments
this year, the lender’s largest individual shareholder said.  “Citigroup has announced publicly that 2012 will be the
year of returning shareholders’ capital,”  Saudi Arabia ’s Prince
Alwaleed Bin Talal told reporters in  Kuwait  today. “No doubt
that the one-cent dividend is very symbolic and for the short-
term.”  Prince Alwaleed, the chairman of Saudi Arabian investment
firm  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , owns a 0.75 percent stake in
Citigroup, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Citigroup spokesman Jon Diat declined to comment.  Citigroup said March 21 it would resume paying a quarterly
dividend of 1 cent per share in the second quarter after a 1-
for-10 reverse stock split. Citigroup hasn’t paid a quarterly
dividend since 2009, when the financial crisis eroded the bank’s
capital. The bank took a $45 billion bailout and taxpayers
guaranteed more than $300 billion of its risky assets.  Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  said in a Jan. 18
conference call that returning capital to shareholders, either
through a dividend or a share buyback, was “a 2012 thing.”  “No doubt, Citigroup is on the right track. Citigroup is
doing very well these days,” Alwaleed said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
