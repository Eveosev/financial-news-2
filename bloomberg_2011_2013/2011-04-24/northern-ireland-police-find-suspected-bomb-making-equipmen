Police in  Northern Ireland 
yesterday found “two large quantities of what is believed to be
bomb-making equipment,” the service said in a  statement  on its
website today.  A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland said
both discoveries were in South Armagh in Northern Ireland. The
hauls follow the arrest on April 22 of three men who are
“helping” police with their probe, the spokesman said.  The PSNI, which is investigating dissident republican
activity with the Republic of Ireland’s police service in South
Armagh, has warned on its website for  vigilance  over the Easter
weekend against a “severe threat posed by terrorists.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
