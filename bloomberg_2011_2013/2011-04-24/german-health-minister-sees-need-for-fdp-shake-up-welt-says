German Health Minister Philipp Roesler, who’s running to become leader of the Free Democratic
Party, said his candidacy marks the beginning of a shake-up in
the top ranks of the party, which is also the junior partner in
government,  Welt am Sonntag  reported, citing an interview.  “It is urgent to restore the party’s credibility and
success,” Roesler told the German newspaper. The priority is to
have the best team for the FDP, he told Welt am Sonntag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
