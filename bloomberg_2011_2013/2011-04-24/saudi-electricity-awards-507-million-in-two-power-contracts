Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO) , the state-
controlled power producer, awarded two contracts valued at 1.9
billion riyals ($507 million) to Alfanar Construction Co. to
reinforce a power plant and build railway substations.  Alfanar will add 280 megawatts to a power plant extension
in Hail, the Riyadh-based contractor said in an e-mailed
statement today. The project will start operations in August
2012.  The second contract is for the construction of six 380-
kilovolt substations for the high-speed Haramain Railway linking
Mecca and Medina. Construction will be finalized in two years,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
