A property tax in  China  is
“desperately needed” to “reverse” the country’s imbalances
in wealth distribution, Zhang Monan, a researcher with the State
Information Center, wrote in a commentary published in today’s
 China Daily  newspaper.  The nation needs to improve its property reporting system
and to levy taxes on various personal holdings, including on
real estate, capital earnings, inheritances and donations, Zhang
wrote. The State Information Center is a research agency under
the National Development and Reform Commission.  China should also “moderately” shift some taxation powers
to local governments from the central government to help
“extricate” some local governments from excessive dependence
on land for revenue, Zhang wrote.  The nation’s plan to raise the individual income tax
threshold to 3,000 yuan from 2,000 yuan a month is an important
step towards narrowing the wealth gap and fixing the country’s
income “distribution disparity,” Zhang wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
