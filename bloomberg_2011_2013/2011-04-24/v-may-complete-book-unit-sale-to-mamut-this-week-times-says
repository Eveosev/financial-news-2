HMV Plc may complete the sale of
its Waterstone’s bookstore chain to Russian billionaire
 Alexander Mamut  for 35 million pounds ($58 million) this week,
the  Sunday Times  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  That’s about half what HMV hoped to sell the business for,
the newspaper said. Tim Waterstone, founder of the U.K. book
chain, may work with Mamut if the bid is successful, according
to the report.  Nick Cosgrove, an outside spokesman for the company,
declined to comment in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
