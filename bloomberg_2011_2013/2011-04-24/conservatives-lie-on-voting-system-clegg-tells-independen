U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick
Clegg  said that the  Conservative Party ’s campaign opposing next
month’s referendum on Britain’s voting system contained “lies,
misinformation and deceit,” the Independent on Sunday reported.  “This nasty No campaign, I hope, will prove to be the
death rattle of a right-wing elite, a right-wing clique who want
to keep things the way they are. That’s why they are lashing
out,” Clegg said in an interview, the Independent reported.  “It includes the Conservative Party, who like this nice
little racket: they get a job for life and they waft into power
and they don’t even need to bother try to get a majority of
people on side,” Clegg said, the Independent reported.  Clegg said it was important to point out ‘lies’ about the
use of counting machines, the rise of extremism and additional
costs of the proposed alternative vote system, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
