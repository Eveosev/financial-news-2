Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said she plans to discuss a free-trade agreement
tomorrow with South Korean President  Lee Myung Bak  and is
confident the two nations will complete a deal.  “I am committed to building Australia’s relationship with
Korea,” Gillard said in a speech yesterday in Seoul, according
to a copy of the  address  on the prime minister’s website. “This
is a partnership full of promise and potential.”  South Korea is Australia’s fourth-largest trading partner,
a nation with a “highly complementary” economy and a consumer
of its liquefied natural gas, Gillard said.  Korea Gas Corp. (036460)  is a
partner in the $16 billion Gladstone LNG project in Queensland
state led by  Santos Ltd. (STO) , Australia’s third-largest oil
producer, while Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Co.
have become “household names,” she said.  “Our trade links are intense and highly complementary,”
Gillard said in her speech. “Australia’s strengths in raw
materials, energy and services have complemented Korea’s
strengths in mass production and heavy industry.”  Australia will contribute A$10 million ($10.7 million) to
 South Korea ’s Global Green Growth Institute, established by the
government to support the development of environmental policies
in developing countries, according to Gillard.  Australia and Japan agreed to work more closely on
developing sources of clean energy following the March 11
earthquake and nuclear crisis and reaffirmed a commitment to
introduce a free-trade agreement, Gillard said April 22 in
Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
