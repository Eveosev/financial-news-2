Hundreds of protesters took to the
streets in  Hong Kong  yesterday in support of detained Chinese
artist Ai Weiwei, the South China Morning Post said today.  The demonstration led by a coalition of artists known as
the Art Citizens marched through Kowloon and then staged a rally
in front of the Cultural Center, the paper said. Organizers said
about 2,000 people took part, while police estimated the turnout
at 900, the paper said.  The reported detention by Chinese authorities of Ai, whose
whereabouts have been unknown since April 3, has prompted
protests from countries including the U.S. and  Germany .  Ai was taken away by Chinese officials after he was
prevented from boarding a flight to Hong Kong at Beijing’s
airport on April 3, Hong Kong’s South  China  Morning Post
reported on April 4. China’s investigation of Ai is related to
suspicion of “economic crimes” and has nothing to do with
human rights, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
