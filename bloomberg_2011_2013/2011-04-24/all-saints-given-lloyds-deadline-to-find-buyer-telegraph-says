U.K. retailer All Saints has been
given a deadline of April 26 to complete a rescue buy-out deal
by lender  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , the Sunday Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Lloyds is believed to have asked  KPMG  LLP to be on standby
to start administration proceedings as early as the morning of
April 27, the newspaper said.  All Saints Chief Executive Officer Stephen Craig said the
company was “in the middle of a transaction we are confident
will complete within the next couple of weeks,” the paper
reported. A Lloyds spokesman said that talks were continuing,
while KPMG declined to comment, the Sunday Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
