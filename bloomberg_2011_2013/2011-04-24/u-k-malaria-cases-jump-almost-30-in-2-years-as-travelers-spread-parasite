Malaria cases in the U.K. have
increased almost 30 percent since 2008, as people visiting
family and friends in  Asia  and Africa didnâ€™t seek or adhere to
medical advice to prevent the mosquito-borne disease, according
to the Health Protection Agency.  Infections rose to 1,761 last year compared with 1,370 in
2008, the U.K. health agency said today in an e-mailed
statement. About 40 percent of the cases in 2010 were among U.K.
residents who had visited  Nigeria , Ghana or India, the HPA said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
