Japanese Trade Minister  Banri Kaieda  said he asked  China  and South Korea to rely on scientific
evidence in deciding whether to ban Japanese goods over concern
they may be contaminated with radiation.  Chinese Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  and South Korean
Trade Minister Kim Jong Hoon both agreed that will be the
criteria for any import restrictions, Kaieda told reporters
after meeting his counterparts in Tokyo today. Chen and Kim also
said safety is their priority, Kaieda added.  Trading partners worldwide are testing Japanese products
for radiation following leaks at the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant, the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.  China, Japan’s largest export market, earlier this month
expanded a ban on imports of food and agricultural produce,
threatening to exacerbate an export slump in the world’s third-
largest economy after a record earthquake disrupted supply
chains.  South Korea , Singapore and the U.S. have also halted
imports of some products on concern that produce grown around
the stricken nuclear station has been contaminated.  Japan, South Korea and China agreed on the need to
accelerate negotiations to form a free-trade agreement among
them, and to “resist protectionism in all forms,” according to
a joint statement released after the discussions today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
