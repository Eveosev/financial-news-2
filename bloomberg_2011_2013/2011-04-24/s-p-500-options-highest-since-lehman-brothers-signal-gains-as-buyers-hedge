The end of the  Federal Reserve ’s
Treasury repurchase program is prompting options traders to pay
the most in four years for protection against stock declines, a
signal that proved bullish in the past.  The cost of three-month put options to sell the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index is almost twice the price of calls to buy, the
highest ratio since July 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The last 17 times that so-called skew rose as high,
the benchmark gauge for American equities climbed a median 3.9
percent over three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Traders are loading up on insurance in the options market
on speculation policy makers will halt their program of
quantitative easing in June. Similar purchases preceded gains in
the past because they meant professional investors who use the
contracts as hedges are buying stocks, said Pam Finelli, head of
European equity derivatives research at Deutsche Bank AG.  “Risk management and portfolio protection is a huge theme
in the market and it’s not unusual to see people expanding their
equity allocation, but doing so with a hedge in place,” Finelli
said in an interview from  London . “The equity market goes up
but the puts stay bid because there’s an underlying hedge that’s
being put on at the same time. This has been a major trend.”  Sergi Martin Amoros, chief executive officer at Credit
 Andorra  Asset Management in Andorra, added to equities following
the March 11 earthquake in  Japan , he said in a telephone
interview on April 21. He’s also buying protection on the firm’s
4 billion euros ($5.8 billion) in investments.  ‘Question Marks’  “We made the most of the March sell-off to add to
positions as equities had weakened,” he said. “There were good
prices and we took the opportunity. We are buying puts and
protection across the board. There are many open fronts, too
many question marks.”  The  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent to 1,334.60 as of 9:42 a.m. in
 New York . It climbed 6.3 percent this year through April 21 as
the U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped to a two-year
low of 8.8 percent in March as companies created more jobs than
forecast, the Labor Department said this month. The economy
probably expanded at a 1.9 percent annual pace in the first
quarter and will grow at an average rate of 3.1 percent though
2013, according to the average of estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  China , Oil  China’s decision to raise its reserve requirement for the
biggest lenders to a record 20.5 percent to cool inflation sent
the S&P 500 down 1.1 percent on April 18, the most in a month.
Oil climbed for a third day to $112.29 in New York April 21,
bringing its advance in the past year to 32 percent. Japan’s
 Nikkei-225 (NKY)  Stock Average plunged to a two-year low of 8,605.15
on March 15 after the earthquake and ensuing tsunami.  “Skew is really driven by net buying pressure of index
puts and as that buying pressure increases, the skew gets
steeper,” said Robert Whaley, a finance professor at  Vanderbilt
University  in Nashville, Tennessee who designed the Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX. “There’s a
significant effort going into managing the economy and people
are more confident than they were, but there’s still that demand
for protection.”  The S&P 500 rose 1.3 percent to 1,337.38 last week, the
most in almost a month, after the biggest U.S. companies
reported better-than-estimated profits. Of the 121 S&P 500
constituents that have reported earnings since April 11, 82
percent have beaten analysts’ per-share earnings estimates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings Surprises  The gauge climbed 1.4 percent on April 20 after Santa
Clara, California-based  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s biggest
chipmaker, forecast second-quarter sales above analysts’
estimates. Cupertino, California-based  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  reported
profit that almost doubled amid rising demand for the iPhone.
 United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , the Hartford, Connecticut-based maker
of Carrier air conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines,
said 2011 sales will be at the high end of its forecast.  “Earnings are still good,” said  Mark Bronzo , who helps
manage $25.5 billion at Security Global Investors in Irvington,
New York. “With China raising rates, higher fuel prices and the
tragedy in Japan, people have gotten concerned that with all of
these disruptions earnings could be impacted as expectations
were high. The worst fear has not been realized.”  Implied Volatility  Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for S&P
500 puts 10 percent below the index was 21.20, 1.86 times the
level for the equivalent calls, on April 20. That ratio is in
the 83rd percentile for the past five years, the data show. In
the 17 occurrences of skew exceeding 1.86 before this year, the
S&P 500 gained after all but two with a median increase of 3.9
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The biggest gain was
9.2 percent in three months after the skew reached 2.03 in July
2006.  The VIX, which measures the cost of S&P 500 options with a
30-day maturity, is down by half from this year’s peak of 29.40
on March 16 to 14.69 last week, the lowest since June 2007. The
three-month VIX is down 32 percent from the peak to 18.35.  The skew ratio reached 2.32, its highest level of the past
five years, on April 13, 2007. Six months later, the S&P 500
peaked at 1,565.15 then plunged 57 percent over the next 17
months, wiping out $11 trillion in U.S. equity value. The lowest
skew during the period was 1.16 on Nov. 20, 2008, the same day
that the VIX soared to a record 80.86 following the bankruptcy
of New York-based securities firm Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Adding to Hedges  Traders are adding to hedges after being caught off guard
by Japan’s earthquake and tsunami, said Mandy Xu, an equity
derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York.
S&P 500 skew was 1.62, the lowest in two months, on March 10,
the day before stocks plunged and volatility soared worldwide.
The VIX and its European counterpart, the  VStoxx Index (V2X) , jumped
to the highest levels since July, while Japan’s Nikkei Stock
Average Volatility Index surged to a two-year high of 69.88.  “While some macro risks have subsided in recent weeks,
such as Japan and the Middle East, and that has driven implied
volatility lower, other option signals suggest investors remain
nervous and continue to hedge,” Xu said. “This is why skew
remains elevated despite the lower VIX.”  The S&P 500 has risen 28 percent since Aug. 26, the day
before Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in  Jackson Hole ,
 Wyoming , that he was willing to do “everything in his power”
to stimulate growth. In November, the central bank pledged to
complete $600 billion in bond purchases by the end of June.  “We’re definitely in a  bull market ,” said Randall Warren,
chief investment officer at Warren Financial Services &
Associates Inc., which trades VIX options and manages $65
million in Exton,  Pennsylvania . “People are worried about a lot
of things, from geopolitical risk to earthquakes in Japan to the
downgrading of  U.S. debt , and there are a million things to be
worried about. But the market is climbing that wall of worry.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
