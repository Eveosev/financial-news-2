NTT Data Corp. (9613) , the network-
services unit of  Japan ’s largest phone company, will acquire
 Italy ’s Value Team SpA to expand overseas sales.  The Tokyo-based company announced the purchase in a
statement, without disclosing a value for the deal. NTT will
spend 250 million euros ($365 million) for the purchase, the
Nikkei newspaper reported earlier today. NTT Data’s spokesman
Norihiko Sugimoto declined to comment on the amount.  President Toru Yamashita plans to spend as much as 300
billion yen ($3.7 billion) on acquisitions to quadruple sales
outside Japan over three years. The purchase of the closely held
Value Team is NTT Data’s seventh overseas deal in the past year,
including Boston-based Keane International Inc. in December,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  NTT Data rose 1.8 percent to 254,500 yen as of 9:22 a.m. on
the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average added 0.7 percent. The stock has declined 9.4 percent
this year, after falling 2.8 percent in 2010.  Value Team, which offers consulting and system engineering
services to Italy’s telecommunications, manufacturing and
financial companies, reported 308 million euros in sales in the
year ended Dec. 31, according to NTT Data’s statement. The
Milan-based company employs 2,923 people, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
