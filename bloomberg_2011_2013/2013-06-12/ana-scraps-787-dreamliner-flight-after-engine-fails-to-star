ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) , operator of the world’s biggest fleet of  Boeing Co. (BA)  787s, scrapped a service with the Dreamliner today, the third cancellation for the aircraft in  Japan  this week after a four-month grounding.  ANA couldn’t use the 787 for the flight from Ube, western Japan, to Tokyo’s Haneda airport as the right engine failed to start, said Megumi Tezuka, a spokeswoman at the company. The airline is looking into the cause and said it was separate from the battery issues that had plagued the Dreamliner earlier.  Japan Airlines Co. (9201) , the world’s second-largest Dreamliner operator, also canceled a service with the 787 yesterday after an indicator on a flight bound for  Singapore  showed problem with the engine anti-icing system. ANA and Japan Air both restarted flights with the plane June 1 after battery malfunctions kept their Dreamliner fleet grounded for more than four months.  On June 10, ANA scrapped a 787 flight to Tokyo from Fukuoka after a sensor next to an engine indicated a possible problem.  ANA had a reliability of 98.9 percent on domestic flights in April, Tezuka said. That means 1.1 percent of the airline’s 812 domestic flights were canceled for reasons ranging from weather delays to maintenance, or roughly eight to nine a day, she said.  The carriers, which have a total of 27 Dreamliners, are flying the fuel-efficient aircraft to cities such as Boston and San Jose,  California , that wouldn’t be profitable with larger planes. The four-month suspension of 787 services would affect sales this year, ANA and JAL have said, after melting batteries on two jets spurred regulators to park all the planes in January.  Biggest Market  Japan has been the biggest market so far for  Boeing (BA) ’s plane, the first jetliner made chiefly of composite plastic materials. That meant ANA and JAL had the broadest disruptions while the aircraft were grounded and Boeing was rushing to find a fix for the lithium-ion batteries.  Among the eight Dreamliner operators whose fleet were grounded by the battery problems, Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise began flying again in April while Qatar Airways Ltd., Air India Ltd. and  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  resumed service last month.  One of ANA’s 787s made an emergency landing on Jan. 16 after smoke from a lithium-ion battery was detected. Nine days earlier, a battery had caught fire on a JAL 787 in  Boston . No one was injured in either incident.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ordered 787s in domestic service grounded, the first such action for an entire model since 1979, and regulators around the world followed suit. The Dreamliner is the only large commercial jet equipped with lithium-ion batteries as part of its power system.  The groundings may have reduced  ANA sales  by about 16 billion yen ($166 million), according to figures from the company. JAL’s probably lost 6.5 billion yen in sales due to the groundings, it has said.  Boeing redesigned the battery to include more protection around individual cells to contain any overheating, added a steel case to prevent fire and a tube that would vent any fumes outside the fuselage. Carriers began 787 test flights after the FAA approved the battery upgrades.
