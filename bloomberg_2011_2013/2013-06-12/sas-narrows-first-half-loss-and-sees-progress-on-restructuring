SAS Group (SAS) , the Nordic region’s
largest airline, narrowed its first-half loss and said
restructuring efforts including job cuts, new pay agreements and
asset disposals are showing “tangible effects.”  The net loss for the six months through April was 1.02
billion kronor ($160 million), compared with a year-earlier loss
of 2.97 billion kronor, Stockholm-based SAS said. Sales for the
period were little changed at 19.5 billion kronor.  “The earnings level is not yet satisfactory,” Chief
Executive Officer Rickard Gustafson said in a statement. “Our
focus is directed to fully completing the restructuring measures
and the forecast of achieving positive income for the full-year
remains firmly in place.”  SAS is targeting earnings before interest and tax equal to
more than 3 percent of sales, assuming a stable fuel price and
no external shocks. The carrier cut about 300 job in the second
quarter and aims to reduce headcount by about 1,000 positions by
the end of the financial year.  Other restructuring measures include the sale of 80 percent
of Wideroe Flyveselskap AS unit for 2 billion kroner and the
outsourcing of ground handling to Swissport International Ltd.
earlier this year.  The company’s 4Excellence savings plan, introduced in
November, aims to deliver 3 billion kronor in savings over the
next two years. The move to slash expenses comes as low-cost
carriers including Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA on short-haul
routes and network operators such as  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group and
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  reduce their own cost bases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
