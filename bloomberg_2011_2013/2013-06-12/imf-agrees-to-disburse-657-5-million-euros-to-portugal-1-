The  International Monetary Fund  said
it agreed to disburse 657.5 million euros to  Portugal  after
reviewing implementation of conditions tied to the country’s
loan program.  Formal approval of the seventh review of Portugal’s aid
program is expected at a meeting of the 17 euro-area finance
ministers on June 20, Portuguese Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar
said on May 29. The IMF, in an e-mailed statement today, said it
was enabling “immediate disbursement.”  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
joblessness and a deepening recession as he cuts spending and
raises taxes to meet the terms of the 78 billion-euro ($104
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the IMF. Coelho
announced measures on May 3 intended to generate savings of
about 4.8 billion euros through 2015 that include reducing the
number of state workers.  Portugal had to propose alternative measures to meet  budget
deficit  targets set in the aid program after the country’s
 Constitutional Court  on April 5 blocked a plan to suspend the
equivalent of a monthly salary payment to state workers and
pensioners this year. The measures blocked by the court
represented 1.3 billion euros of savings in 2013, or about 0.8
percent of the country’s gross domestic product of 164 billion
euros.  Economic Growth  Economic growth has averaged less than 1 percent a year for
the past decade, placing Portugal among  Europe ’s weakest
performers. The government projects GDP will contract 2.3
percent this year before growing 0.6 percent next year. The
jobless rate will climb to 18.2 percent in 2013 and 18.5 percent
in 2014.  The government on March 15 announced less ambitious targets
for narrowing its budget deficit as it forecast the economy will
shrink twice as much as previously estimated this year. The
government targets a deficit equivalent to 5.5 percent of GDP in
2013, 4 percent in 2014 and below the EU’s 3 percent limit in
2015, when it aims for a 2.5 percent gap. It forecasts debt will
peak at 123.7 percent of GDP in 2014.  Portugal in September had already been given more time to
narrow its budget gap after  tax revenue  missed forecasts.  The EU may consider giving Portugal more time to meet its
deficit targets if economic conditions worsen, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the group of euro-area finance ministers,
said on May 27. Dijsselbloem said the government hasn’t yet
requested another change of timetables and targets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
