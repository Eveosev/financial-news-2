H&R Block Inc. (HRB) , the biggest U.S. tax
preparer, posted a fiscal fourth-quarter profit that fell short
of analysts’ estimates amid tax-law changes and filing delays.  Net income  from continuing operations for the three months
ended April 30 rose 16 percent to $688.9 million, or $2.51 a
share, from $591.7 million, or $2.01, a year earlier, the Kansas
City, Missouri-based company said today in a statement. Adjusted
earnings per share, which excludes some items, was $2.54,
missing the $2.61 average  estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  H&R Block, led by Chief Executive Officer Bill Cobb, said
last year that it would cut about 350 jobs and close offices as
the firm sought to recapture market share lost to TurboTax maker
 Intuit Inc. (INTU)  Internal Revenue Service changes and new U.S. tax
laws led to the filing of fewer returns during the quarter, the
firm said.  “Considering the challenges the industry faced this tax
season, we’re pleased to have executed well and delivered
improved profits,” Cobb, 56, said in the statement. “We also
gained share for the third consecutive year in the important
digital online category.”  H&R Block fell 1.9 percent to $28.83 at 4:01 p.m. in New
York. The shares have climbed 55 percent this year, outpacing
the 13 percent advance for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)   Fewer Returns  The shares slid in late April after the company said it
handled fewer returns than expected during the 2013 tax season.
The stock has since recovered as investors expect the U.S.
health care overhaul and potential changes in immigration policy
to increase the number of people who file tax returns,  Mark Palmer , a New York-based analyst at BTIG LLC, wrote yesterday in
a report.  Fourth-quarter revenue rose 10 percent to $2.2 billion,
according to the statement. Total U.S. returns prepared by H&R
Block fell 0.7 percent to 22.2 million in the fiscal year ended
April 30, the company said. Returns filed online and with the
company’s desktop software climbed 3.1 percent to 7.67 million.  H&R Block said last year that it hired New York-based
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help the tax preparer explore
“strategic alternatives” for its bank. Selling the unit may
free up as much as $400 million of capital that may be used to
buy back stock, Palmer said.  The tax preparer repurchased 21.3 million shares for $315
million, or $14.82 per share, during the fiscal year, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
