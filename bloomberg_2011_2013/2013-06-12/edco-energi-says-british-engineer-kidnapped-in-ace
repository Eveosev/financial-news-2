PT Medco Energi Internasional (MEDC)  said a
British energy engineer was kidnapped by a group of men on
Indonesia’s Sumatra island yesterday, in a rare attack targeting
a foreign worker.  Malcolm Primrose, 62, was abducted from his car near the
Matang-1 Block A gas exploration well in Aceh province, where he
was working as a subcontractor, the Jakarta-based company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  “All parties are working round the clock to find his
location,” Medco, Indonesia’s largest private oil and gas
producer, said in the statement.  Aceh, Indonesia’s westernmost province and the only one
with Shariah law, was the base for a training camp for Islamic
militants who planned to bomb foreign embassies and hotels,
Indonesian police said after raiding the camp in 2010. Militants
have robbed banks in the past to raise funds.  Medco said it’s coordinating with local security and
government officials in an effort to ensure Primrose will be
released safely. Primrose is working for subcontractor Blade
Engineering, Medco said.  Aceh is  Indonesia ’s third-wealthiest province by resources.
A 30-year separatist war and the 2004 tsunami killed a combined
5 percent of the population, leaving a fragile peace and the
country’s fourth-highest poverty level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
