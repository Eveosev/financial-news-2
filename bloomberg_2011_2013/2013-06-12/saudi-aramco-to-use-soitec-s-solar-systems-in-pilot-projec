Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, will evaluate  Soitec (SOI) ’s solar energy
systems for possible utility-scale deployments.  Saudi Aramco  chose the company’s equipment in a competitive
bidding process for a 1-megawatt pilot project that Belectric
Holding GmbH will build in Saudi Arabia’s northwestern Tabuk
region, Bernin, France-based Soitec said today in a statement.
The expected cost wasn’t disclosed.  Saudi Arabia’s government estimates that demand for
electricity in the country may exceed 120 gigawatts in 20 years,
and the kingdom plans to introduce more renewable power to meet
that need, including 41 gigawatts of solar generating capacity
by 2032, Soitec said.  Khaled Juffali Co., a Saudi Arabian  investment company , is
Soitec’s partner for the project. It agreed in April to
cooperate with the French manufacturer on solar installations in
 Saudi Arabia  and the Middle East.  Soitec’s concentrating photovoltaic, or CPV, systems use
lenses and mirrors to focus sunlight on solar panels and
generate more power than conventional products. Its technology
has achieved energy-generating efficiencies of 30 percent, about
twice that of conventional photovoltaic panels, Soitec said.  CPV equipment is typically more expensive than standard
solar panels, which have fallen in  price  by about 56 percent
since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
