Senator  Claire McCaskill  said she
opposes removing decisions on sexual-assault cases from the
military chain of command, a move sought by victims’ advocates
and proposed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.  “I’ve come to the floor before we convene to explain why I
am supporting significant changes as to how we handle sexual
assaults in the military, but also why I am not supporting
completely removing the role senior military commanders play in
ordering these kinds of trials to go forward,” McCaskill, a
Missouri Democrat, said on the Senate floor before the Armed
Services Committee met to tackle the issue.  Committee leaders were preparing to strike the provision to
turn over sex-assault cases to independent military prosecutors
that was championed by Gillibrand, a  New York  Democrat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
