Detroit, the Michigan city that’s on
the brink of bankruptcy, had its general-obligation bond rating
cut four levels by  Standard & Poor’s  to CCC- from B.  The so-called superdowngrade of more than three levels “is
based on recent announcements from the city’s emergency
financial manager that Detroit may take steps to adjust payments
to bondholders, as well as immediate plans to meet with
bondholders to discuss the city’s financial condition and
resources,” S&P said today in a report.  Emergency financial manager Kevyn Orr plans to meet June 14
with more than 100 creditors, union leaders and bond insurers on
his preliminary proposal to avert a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing.
He said in a report last month that he would cut debt costs by
lengthening payback terms, lowering  interest rates  or obtaining
forgiveness on some obligations.  The CCC- rating is nine steps below investment grade, and
“has a currently identifiable vulnerability to default,”
according to S&P’s grading scale. The outlook on the city is
negative, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
