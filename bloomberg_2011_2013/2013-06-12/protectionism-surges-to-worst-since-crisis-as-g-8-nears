Global trade protectionism has
surged to its highest since the financial crisis began in a
threat to economic growth, according to Global Trade Alert.  Four-hundred-thirty-one new protectionist measures were
imposed from June 2012 to this month compared with 141 steps
taken to liberalize commerce, said GTA, which was created in
2009 by University of St. Gallen professor Simon Evenett in
 Switzerland . Another 183 practices aimed at restricting trade
are in the pipeline.  With trade on the agenda for the upcoming U.K. meeting of
Group of Eight leaders, the report said such nations were
responsible for almost a third of protectionist measures over
the past year.  “G-8 countries have a massive stake in preserving an open
trading system,” said Evenett in a statement. “Each
protectionist measure is a termite eating away at one route to
economic recovery.”  Leaders from Russia, Germany, France, the U.S., Japan,
 Italy  and Canada will join U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  at
the Lough Erne resort in County Fermanagh in  Northern Ireland 
for the conference of G-8 leaders on June 17-18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
