The pound strengthened to a three-week high against the euro after a government report showed U.K.
jobless claims fell more last month than economists forecast.  Sterling advanced for a second day versus the 17-nation
currency as a wider measure of unemployment declined in April,
adding to evidence an economic recovery is under way. U.K. 30-year bonds rose for a second day after yields climbed to the
highest since February yesterday. Gilts have led losses among
the bonds of Group-of-Seven nations this year as government
securities have tumbled amid speculation the Federal Reserve
will taper its asset purchases.  “The pound is outperforming across the board,” said Neil Jones, head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. in  London . “U.K. data continues to point to a
recovery. Overseas investors are encouraged by the data and are
buying the pound in order to purchase U.K. assets.”  The pound rose 0.1 percent to 85.03 pence per euro as of
4:35 p.m. London time after appreciating to 84.70 pence, the
strongest level since May 21. The U.K. currency rose 0.2 percent
to $1.5676 after climbing as much as 0.3 percent.  Sterling has gained 5.8 percent in the past three months,
the best performer among the 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
was little changed and the euro appreciated 2.6 percent.  Jobless Claims   U.K. jobless claims  fell by 8,600 in May to 1.51 million,
the Office for National Statistics said in London. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted a decline of 5,000.
Employment rose 24,000 to a record 29.8 million, while the
jobless rate stayed at 7.8 percent.  The yield on the  30-year gilt  fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.40 percent after climbing to 3.47
percent yesterday, the highest level since Feb. 14. The price of
the 3.25 percent security due in January 2044 rose 0.29, or 2.90
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 97.10.  The benchmark  10-year (GUKG2)  yield also slid two basis points, to
2.16 percent, after increasing to 2.24 percent yesterday, also
the most since Feb. 14.  “The move today may just be because of the yield levels we
have right now,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst
at Investec Bank Plc in London. “We have obviously had a big
move over the past few days and so people might think there’s a
bit of value at these levels.”  ‘Bigger Picture’  Gilts handed investors a loss of 2 percent this year
through yesterday, according to the Bloomberg U.K. Sovereign
Bond  Index. (BRIT)  German bonds and U.S. Treasuries dropped 1.2
percent, separate Bloomberg indexes show.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds has widened four basis
points this week to 56 basis points.  The decline in gilts this year is “part of the bigger
picture,” said Jason Simpson, a rates strategist at Banco
Santander SA in London. “It’s all about the Fed. In a falling
market, unless domestic factors are supportive, you expect gilts
to underperform, given they are a thinner market than bunds or
Treasuries. It is also not really a coincidence that the market
is underperforming in a week that has two auctions.”  The U.K. Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction
2.25 billion pounds of securities due in 2032 tomorrow,
following a 3.75 billion-pound sale of new benchmark debt
maturing in 2023 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
