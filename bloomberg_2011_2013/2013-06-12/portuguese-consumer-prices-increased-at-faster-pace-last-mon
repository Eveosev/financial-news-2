Portugal ’s consumer price index rose
in May from a year earlier at a faster pace than recorded in
April.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
climbed 0.9 percent from a year earlier, more than the 0.4
percent increase in April, the Lisbon-based National Statistics
Institute said today in an e-mailed statement.
Prices rose 0.2 percent from April.  Using the statistics institute’s own methods, consumer
prices rose 0.7 percent in May from a year earlier and climbed
0.2 percent from April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
