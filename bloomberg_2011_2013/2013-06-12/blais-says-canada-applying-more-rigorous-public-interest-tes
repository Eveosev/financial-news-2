  Canada ’s top broadcast regulator
said he is applying a “more rigorous” public-interest test on
ownership transactions in the country’s broadcasting industry.  In a speech today at a media conference in Banff, Alberta,
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission
Chairman Jean-Pierre Blais said it’s important for regulators to
be audacious to serve the interests of Canadians, citing his
decision to toughen regulation in the wireless phone market and
last year’s rejection of  BCE Inc. (BCE) ’s bid for specialty-channel
provider  Astral Media (ACM/A)  Inc.  “That was clear from our response to the initial
application made by BCE to acquire control of almost all of
Astral’s holdings,” Blais said in the text of the  speech  posted
on the agency’s website. “Our decision last fall sent a clear
signal that the public interest is paramount.”  Blais rejected BCE’s C$3 billion ($2.95 billion) bid for
Astral Oct. 18, saying the takeover would curb television and
radio competition. BCE has since revised its offer for Astral,
agreeing to sell assets to allay concerns about its size.
Hearings on the new bid were held last month in  Montreal .  BCE shares fell to C$43.95 in Toronto today, the lowest
level since January, while Astral shares fell 3 cents to
C$48.53.  To contact the reporters on this story:
