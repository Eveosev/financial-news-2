Profits for crop farmers in the U.K.
may be smaller than previously expected after wet weather
reduced quality and spurred some abandonment of acres, said
Allan Wilkinson, the head of agriculture at HSBC.  Profits for an average 650-hectare (1,600-acre) farm may be
as low as 105,000 pounds ($164,490) in 2013, compared with a
forecast in October of 244,215 pounds, Wilkinson said today at
the  Cereals  conference near Lincoln,  England . In 2012, profits
were 260,657 pounds for a farm that size raising wheat, beans,
barley and rapeseed. Crops this season are of “very variable
quality” after excess rainfall, he said in an interview.  “It comes down to the impact of weather,” Wilkinson said.
“There are increasing short-term issues surrounding cash
flows.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
