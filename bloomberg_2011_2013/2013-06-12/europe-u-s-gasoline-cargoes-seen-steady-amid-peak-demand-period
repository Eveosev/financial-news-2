The number of gasoline cargoes
booked for shipment to the U.S. from Europe will remain little
changed over the next two weeks as the country’s peak demand
period continues, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Traders will charter a total of 21 Medium Range tankers for
loading to June 25, the median in a survey yesterday and today
of seven shipbrokers and traders showed. That compares with 22
vessels, each normally carrying 37,000 metric tons of the auto
fuel, in a corresponding survey last week. There are 28 ships
available for the trade, 17 fewer than last week.  U.S. gasoline usage typically peaks during the so-called
driving season between the Memorial Day holiday in late May and
Labor Day in early September. Demand is forecast to show a
seasonal gain of around 300,000 barrels a day during the summer
months, the International Energy Agency said in a report today.  “Anecdotal reports that the driving season has recently
receded in importance appear overdone,” the Paris-based adviser
to 28 developed nations said. Still, it predicted a 0.1 percent
drop in U.S. gasoline demand for the entire year.  Tankers plying the trans-Atlantic route were earning $8,647
daily as of yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 28, according to
the Baltic Exchange in  London .  Twelve of the 21 charters have been completed and the rest
are anticipated, the latest survey showed. Ship bookings often
contain clauses allowing vessels to sail to different ports.  The survey is based on the industry’s benchmark Rotterdam-to-New York voyage, which takes about 11 days at 12.5 knots,
according to the sea-distances.com website. Below is a table of
ships chartered, probably hired and available to be booked for
the journey loading over the two-week periods from the dates
shown.  *T                             June 11     June 4       Change
