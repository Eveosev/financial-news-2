Stocks in Switzerland  were little
changed as investors watched trends in bond yields and corporate
takeovers across Europe.  Givaudan SA, the world’s largest maker of flavorings,
gained 1.2 percent.  Newron Pharmaceuticals SpA (NWRN)  jumped to a nine-month high as the Italian developer of an experimental treatment
for Parkinson’s disease said it will detail more benefits of its
safinamide drug. Georg Fischer AG advanced 2.3 percent.  Nobel
Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  lost 3.2 percent after UBS AG added the
shares to its “least-preferred” list.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  slipped less than 0.1 percent to
7,671.61 at 10:01 a.m. in Zurich. The gauge retreated yesterday
as the Bank of Japan refrained from expanding stimulus and
Treasuries sank amid speculation the Federal Reserve will trim
bond purchases. The equity benchmark has pared this year’s gains
to 12 percent, from as much as 23 percent on May 22. The broader
 Swiss Performance Index (SPI)  was also little changed today.  “The bond markets are being watched very closely by stock
investors,” said Peter Braendle, who helps manage $60 billion
at Swisscanto Asset Management in Zurich. “They look calmer
than yesterday, which is good. So there’s no more panic in the
market, but investors are on the sidelines and taking a
breather. They’re also getting more excited about possible
takeovers increasing in Europe, like  Kabel Deutschland  in
Germany, for example.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
