Syrian helicopters attacked homes
and roads in the heart of a Lebanese border town, drawing
 Syria ’s smaller neighbor deeper into its civil war.  While Syrian warplanes and helicopters have fired missiles
on the outskirts of Ersal before, today’s assault on the
northeastern town was a rare attack on a Lebanese urban center
and suggestive of the sectarian nature of the widening war.  The Lebanese Army said in a statement that a Syrian
helicopter fired two missiles at the center of Ersal, injuring
one resident. It said the army has taken the necessary
“defensive measures to instantly respond to any similar
violation.”  Ersal is mostly Sunni Muslim, as are rebels battling Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad, whose Alawite sect is an offshoot of
Shiite Islam. The strike took place following a funeral in Ersal
for a local Sunni man shot dead by unidentified gunmen while
driving through a mostly Shiite town, LBC TV said.  LBC said the dead man’s brother blamed the killing on
Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite militant group that has joined the
fighting on Assad’s behalf and is credited with helping his
forces deal a recent series of setbacks to rebels.  He said Ersal’s residents were being punished for housing
25,000 Syrian refugees, most living on empty plots, gardens and
streets, according to LBC.  The Syrian conflict, which began in March 2011, has spilled
into Lebanon, deepening Sunni-Shiite rifts and sparking sporadic
fighting between pro- and anti-Assad forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
