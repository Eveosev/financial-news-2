Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  promoted
Thomas Wittman to oversee its three U.S.  stock exchanges , adding
to his existing role running the company’s options business.  Wittman, who joined Nasdaq after the company’s acquisition
of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in 2008, will report to Eric Noll, who heads Nasdaq’s transaction services in the U.S.,
according to spokesman Robert Madden. Brad Vopni, previously the
head of equity product management and strategy, left the company
last week as part of the management change.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Greifeld  is diversifying the
business to offset a global decline in stock trading. In the
past year, the exchange has bought eSpeed, an electronic
platform for trading U.S. Treasury bonds, the shareholder-relations unit of Thomson Reuters Corp. and a 25 percent stake
in TOM, a Dutch alternative trading system focused on options.  Nasdaq, based in New York, owns 10 equities markets around
the world, including three in the U.S. It operates two U.S.
options markets that represent 25 percent of the total volume,
according to the company’s website.  Wittman previously worked at the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, where he helped transition the firm’s options business
from a floor-based, specialist system to an electronic platform,
according to his profile on Nasdaq’s website.  The Wall Street Journal reported the management changes
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
