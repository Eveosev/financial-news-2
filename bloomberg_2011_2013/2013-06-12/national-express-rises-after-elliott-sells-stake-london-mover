National Express Group Plc (NEX)  rose the
most since May 9 as Elliott Capital Advisors sold its remaining
9.9 percent stake in the U.K.’s largest coach operator.  National Express  shares  advanced 3 percent to 212.4 pence
in London trading, the second-biggest gain in the 21-company
 Stoxx 600 Europe Travel and Leisure Index . Elliott now has no
stake in National Express, the bus and train company said in a
statement today. Elliott previously sold another 9.9 percent
stake in March.  “When they sold down half the stake, the market’s
immediate thinking was, ‘When will they sell the rest?’” John Lawson, an analyst at  Investec Plc (INVP) , said in a phone interview.
“If they’re clearing up that uncertainty, that removes some
overhang.”  National Express came to a truce with Elliott two years
ago, agreeing to adjust the composition of its board after the
investor demanded that management consider a takeover or breakup
to boost earnings.  Elliott, part of New York-based hedge fund Elliott
Associates LP, sold the remaining 9.9 percent stake, or 50.6
million shares, through an offering handled by UBS AG, according
to terms obtained by Bloomberg News yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
