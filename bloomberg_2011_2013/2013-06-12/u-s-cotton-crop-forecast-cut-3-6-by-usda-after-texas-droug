The  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  trimmed its forecast for the domestic cotton
crop by 3.6 percent because of dry conditions in  Texas , the
biggest state grower. The cut beat analysts’ expectations.  In the 12 months starting Aug. 1, farmers may harvest
13.5 million bales, down from 14 million projected last
month, the USDA said today in a report. On average,
analysts and traders expected a drop to 13.98 million
bales, a Bloomberg survey showed. A year earlier, the crop
was 17.32 million bales. The U.S. is the world’s top
exporter.  As of June 4, exceptional- or extreme-drought
conditions spread in West Texas and north-central areas of
the state, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Through
yesterday, cotton futures in New York climbed 13 percent
this year as the USDA projected a reduction in acreage
after lower prices in 2012 prompted growers to shift to
more-profitable crops including corn and soybeans.  “Early indications suggest the western half of the
Cotton Belt may see drought conditions persist well into
summer,” Gary Raines, a vice president of economics and
analysis at FCStone LLC in Nashville,  Tennessee , said in an
e-mail. “This outlook is particularly troubling for
abandonment prospects in Texas.”  U.S. exports may be 11 million bales in the 12 months
that start Aug. 1, down from 13.6 million in the current
season, the government said. Unsold supplies may drop to
2.6 million bales from 3.6 million, and yields may decline
to 800 pounds per acre from 887 pounds.  World output will be 117.16 million bales, down from
120.97 million, the agency said. Consumption will be 110.17
million bales, up from 108.1 million. Stockpiles may be
92.49 million bales, up 8.9 percent from 84.93 million. A
bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
