U.S. life insurers, a group led by
 MetLife Inc. (MET)  and  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , face pressures from
low interest rates that could lead to taking on more investment
risk, according to a report from U.S. Treasury Department.  “Insurers may be tempted to ‘reach for yield’ by investing
in higher-yielding, but riskier, assets,” the Treasury’s
Federal Insurance Office said in a report today. “A sustained
low interest rate environment may lead insurers to offer
products for which risk management becomes more tenuous.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
