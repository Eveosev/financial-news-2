Azerbaijan ’s decline in oil output
slowed in the first five months as  BP Plc (BP/)  stabilized production
at the country’s largest deposit.  The Caspian Sea nation pumped 18.1 million metric tons of
crude in January through May, a decline of 2.2 percent from a
year earlier, according to data published today on the  website 
of the State Statistics Committee, based in the capital of Baku.
That compares with a 7.5 percent slide in the period a year ago.  BP Regional Manager Gordon Birrell last week said output at
the offshore Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field had stabilized at an
average 660,000 barrels a day in the first five months. The
field, known as ACG, cut production by 7 percent last year.  ACG, where partners include State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or
Socar,  Statoil ASA (STL) , Exxon Mobil Corp., and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,
produced 32.9 million tons of oil last year, or 77 percent of
the country’s total output.  Azerbaijan’s production of marketable natural gas held at
7.4 billion cubic meters in the first five months after growing
8.5 percent a year earlier, according to the committee’s data.  The country increased production of marketable gas by 5.4
percent to 17.2 billion cubic meters last year. The country
exports the fuel to Russia, Georgia and Turkey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
