Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , which
operates seven Nordic and Baltic exchanges, offered clients
technology that allows them to access the Oslo bourse.  The so-called smart-order routing technology means traders
on  Nasdaq , which runs all the markets in the region except the
Oslo exchange, can access the Norwegian market through the owner
of the second-largest U.S. stock exchange. The service means
traders can use Nasdaq’s trading system to access all five
 Nordic countries , the New York-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “Technology and connectivity are important for our
customers,” said Lauri Rosendahl, senior vice president of
Nordic equities at Nasdaq, said in the statement. “The new
routing offering makes Nasdaq OMX a one-stop shop for Nordic
equities.”  Oslo Bors, operator of the Norwegian exchange, in October
agreed to buy Burgundy, an alternative trading system focused on
the Nordic region, as it sought to boost volumes. Trading on the
Oslo market has dropped since 2008 as the financial crisis
curbed volumes and as banks, including Deutsche Bank AG, cut
headcount to reduce costs. In August, the Norwegian exchange
shortened its opening by an hour after requests from traders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
