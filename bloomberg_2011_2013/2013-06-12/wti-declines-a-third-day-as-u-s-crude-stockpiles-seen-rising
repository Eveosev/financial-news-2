West Texas Intermediate traded near
its lowest closing level in three days amid signs of expanding
U.S. supplies and as the International Energy Agency trimmed
demand estimates for OPEC’s crude.  WTI fluctuated after losing 0.4 percent yesterday to settle
at its lowest price since June 6. U.S. Energy Department data
today may show crude  inventories  in the world’s largest oil-consuming nation dropped 1.5 million barrels last week,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. The IEA trimmed forecasts
for the amount of oil OPEC needs to supply in the second half of
the year on signs of slower Chinese growth.  “Gloomier overall sentiment is weighing on prices,” said
 Eugen Weinberg , head of commodities research at Commerzbank AG
in  Frankfurt . “There was not much positive for the market in
today’s IEA report. The supply risks, however, should further
support the prices.”  WTI for July delivery traded 8 cents lower at $95.30 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange
as of 1:45 p.m. London time, after declining as much as 92 cents
to $94.46. The volume of all futures traded was 25 percent below
the 100-day average. The contract lost 39 cents to close at
$95.38 yesterday.  IEA Assessment  Brent for July settlement gained 7 cents to $103.03 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark grade was at a premium of $7.72 to WTI. The
spread narrowed for a fifth day yesterday to close at $7.58.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will need
to provide an average of 29.8 million barrels a day in the
second half of the year, the IEA said today in its monthly
market report, trimming the forecast in its previous report by
200,000 barrels a day. That would require OPEC to cut output by
1.1 million barrels from the 30.9 million it pumped in May,
according to the IEA. The agency kept its estimates for global
oil demand for this year unchanged.  Oil use will increase worldwide by 785,000 barrels a day,
or 0.9 percent, to 90.6 million a day as “relatively sluggish
macroeconomic conditions are expected to keep a lid on growth,”
the IEA said.  The report from the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical unit, is projected to show that
gasoline supplies increased by  500,000 barrels , according to the
median estimate of 11 analysts in the Bloomberg survey. The
report is due for release at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute said
yesterday that crude supplies rose by  8.97 million barrels  last
week, the biggest gain since January 2009. U.S. gasoline
inventories climbed 1.04 million barrels, the API said.  The API in Washington collects the information on a
voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the EIA for its weekly survey.  -- Editors:Bruce Stanley, John Buckley  To contact the reporter on this story:
