Dollarama Inc. (DOL) ,  Canada ’s largest
dollar-store retailer, plunged the most in almost two years
after reporting first-quarter earnings per share that fell short
of analysts’ estimates for the first time since it went public.  Dollarama, based in  Montreal , sank as much as 4.8 percent
to C$69.12, and was down 4.1 percent to C$69.59 at 10:29 a.m.
today in Toronto, the biggest intraday drop since August 2011.
The stock rose 23 percent through yesterday, the fourth-best
performer among 18 stocks in the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Consumer
Discretionary Index.  The company reported adjusted earnings of 62 Canadian cents
a share, short of the  median estimate  of 67 cents according to a
Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  Dollarama had topped analyst estimates for 14 straight
quarters since the company’s initial public offering in October
2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The stock has 13 buys and 3 holds,  according  to ratings
compiled by Bloomberg.  Same-store sales, a measure of sales at stores open for at
least a year, rose 3.7 percent in the quarter, compared with 4.6
percent growth a year ago. Gross margin for the quarter was 35.9
percent, compared with 36.3 percent in 2012, Dollarama said in a
statement.  “It was a disappointing quarter, the biggest surprise for
us was the operating costs, which were way higher than what we
expected,” Bobby Hagedorn, analyst with Edward Jones & Co.,
said on the phone from  St. Louis . “They attributed it to costs
from the increased pace of store openings.”  Cost Squeeze  Dollarama opened 21 net new stores in the first quarter and
has added 85 net new stores in the past year compared with 54 in
prior comparable period. The costs of setting up the new stores
as well as training staff are expected to impact Dollarama’s
earnings for the next three quarters, the company said.  “We’re take a bit of a longer-term view, that this is a
blip for them, and they will begin to see the benefits of the
store openings,” Hagedorn said. “If they can get their same-store sales back to the 5 or 6 percent level, that could also
help them mask that effect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
