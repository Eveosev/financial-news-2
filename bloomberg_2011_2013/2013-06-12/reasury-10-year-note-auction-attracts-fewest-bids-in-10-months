The Treasury’s $21 billion 10-year
note auction attracted the least demand since August, the second
consecutive sale of coupon debt this week to be hampered by
concern the Federal Reserve will slow its asset purchases.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered yesterday was
2.53, the least since the 2.49 ratio on Aug. 8. At the auction
of $32 billion in three-year notes June 11, the  bid-to-cover 
ratio was 2.95, the least since December 2010.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes climbed this week to the
highest levels in 14 months as investors speculate whether the
economy is strengthening enough for Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
to consider tapering purchases of Treasuries and mortgage debt
that have been used to keep borrowing rates low. The central
bank’s Federal Open Market Committee meets June 18-19.  “There doesn’t seem to be a great deal of sponsorship at
these levels,” said Kevin Flanagan, chief fixed-income
strategist in Purchase, New York, for Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney. “There seems to be some trepidation stepping in
especially in front of the FOMC meeting. They are looking for
clarity from the committee in terms of what Bernanke said a
couple of weeks ago.”  The current  10-year note yield  rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.23 percent yesterday in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It touched 2.29 percent
on June 11, the highest since April 2012.  The benchmark yield has increased from this year’s low of
1.61 percent set May 1.  Easing Demand  Demand for Treasuries at auction has slackened this year
amid signs of improvement with the U.S. economy. Investors have
bid $2.97 for each dollar of debt sold at the U.S. government’s
$958 billion in Treasury notes and bonds sold at auction,
compared with a record bid-to-cover ratio of $3.15 set in 2012,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 10-year notes sold yesterday  yielded  2.209 percent, the
highest since October 2011, versus a forecast of 2.195 percent
in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Fed’s 21 primary
dealers.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 51.7 percent of the notes, the highest
level since December 2011. That compares with an average of 35.8
percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 11.7 percent of
the notes, the lowest since September. That compares with an
average of 21.2 percent at the last 10 auctions.  Dealer Bids  Primary dealers were awarded 36.6 percent of the offering,
compared with 49.2 percent at the May sale, the highest since
January.  “The street stood back from this one to some degree,”
said Dan Mulholland, head of Treasury trading at BNY Mellon
Capital Markets in New York. “The street’s been beat up pretty
badly” in the value of its fixed-income inventory.  Ten-year U.S. debt has lost 2.5 percent this year, compared
with a 1.4 percent drop in the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
benchmark notes returned 4.2 percent in 2012, compared with a
2.2 percent gain by Treasuries overall. The government will
auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds today.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs and spur economic growth. It will slow the
purchases to $65 billion a month at its October meeting,
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
