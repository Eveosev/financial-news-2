Cotton futures jumped to the highest
in almost five weeks after the government cut its forecast for
output in the U.S., the world’s leading exporter.  In the 12 months starting Aug. 1, American farmers may
harvest 13.5 million bales, down from 14 million projected last
month, the Department of Agriculture said today. On average,
analysts expected 13.98 million bales, a Bloomberg News survey
showed. Domestic output will drop 22 percent after a drought
hurt crops. The agency also boosted its export estimate for the
current season and trimmed its projection for stockpiles.  “The U.S. numbers, in particular new-crop, are friendly,
if not bullish,” for prices, Sharon Johnson, a senior market
specialist with Knight Futures in Roswell, Atlanta, said in an
e-mail.  Cotton for December delivery surged 3.4 percent to settle
at 88.07 cents a pound at 2:34 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Earlier, the price reached 88.18 cents a pound, the
highest for a most-active contract since May 9. In the past 12
months, the fiber climbed 28 percent.  The USDA projects global stockpiles by July 31, 2014, at
92.49 million bales, up 8.9 percent from the current season, led
by inventory gains in  China , the biggest importer.  The higher U.S. prices  may “hurt demand, assuming foreign
supplies can make up the difference,” Johnson said.  Cotton is the biggest gainer this year among the 24 raw
materials tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index. A
bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
