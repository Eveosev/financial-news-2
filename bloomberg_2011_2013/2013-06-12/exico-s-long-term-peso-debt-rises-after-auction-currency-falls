Mexico ’s longest-term peso bonds
rose for a second day as the results of a government auction
yesterday indicated that demand for the securities may rebound.  Yields on peso-denominated debt due in November 2042 fell
almost one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.7 percent
at 5:21 p.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield declined 10 basis points yesterday. The
peso weakened 0.8 percent to 12.9314 today.  The government sold 4.5 billion pesos ($348 million) in 30-year debt yesterday at a yield of 6.71 percent. The bid-to-cover
ratio, a measure of investor demand, was 3.96. Yields on the
2042 bonds surged 46 basis points in the four days before the
sale as concern mounted that the  Federal Reserve  will pare the
U.S. stimulus program that has driven demand for Mexico’s
higher-yielding securities.  “Given the market’s low liquidity in prior days, the
market had become afraid of a bad result” in the auction,
Gerardo Welsh, a bond trader at Banco Base SA, wrote in an e-mailed response to questions. “The result and demand for the
2042 bond yesterday gave some peace to the market and today’s
yield drop reflects that.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said May 22 that policy makers
could consider reducing the pace of its quantitative easing, or
QE, program if they see indications of sustainable improvement
in the labor market. The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries
and mortgage securities each month to support the world’s
largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
