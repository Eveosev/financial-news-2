Indian  government bonds  rose for the
first time in a week on speculation a jump in the 10-year yield
to the highest in almost a month yesterday is luring buyers.  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent notes due June 2022
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.51 percent
as of 10:24 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The rate rose 12 basis points in the first two
days of the week, touching 7.53 percent yesterday, the highest
level since May 13.  The rupee rebounded from a record low touched yesterday,
easing concern a weakening currency will stoke inflation. The
wholesale  price index  probably rose 4.87 percent in May, the
least since 2009, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists
before the data due June 14.  “There is some value buying at these levels, particularly
by state-run banks,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, the Mumbai-based
executive vice president of treasury at Dhanalaxmi Bank Ltd.
“Inflation is also on a downward trend.”  The rupee has declined 6.6 percent this quarter, the worst
performer among  Asia ’s 11 most-traded currencies. A 10 percent
drop would add 60 to 80 basis points to headline wholesale price
 inflation  and widen the current-account deficit by 0.4 percent
of gross domestic product, Mumbai-based Nomura Holdings Inc.
economists Sonal Varma and Aman Mohunta wrote in a research note.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivatives contract
used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one
basis point to 7.24 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
