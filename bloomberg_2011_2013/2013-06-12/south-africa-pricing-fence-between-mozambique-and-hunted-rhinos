South Africa  is assessing the costs
of rebuilding a fence between the Kruger National Park and
 Mozambique  to deter poachers who’ve killed 350 rhinos this year,
Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa said.  A request was received from South African National Parks,
or SANParks, to re-erect the boundary, Molewa said in reply to a
question in Parliament. “The duration of the construction will
be determined once investigations are completed.”  At least 350 rhinos have been killed in South Africa this
year, with 242 in Kruger National Park, which borders
Mozambique, the Department of Environmental Affairs said in a
May 23 statement. The animals’ horns sell in China and  Vietnam 
for more than gold by weight.  Police and rangers have arrested three suspected poachers,
SANParks said in a statement today. This year 56 people have
been arrested in connection with poaching in the park.  To contact the reporter on this story:
