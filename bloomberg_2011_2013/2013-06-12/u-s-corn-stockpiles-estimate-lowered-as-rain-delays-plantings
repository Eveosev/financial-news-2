Corn inventories in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower and exporter, will be smaller than the
government forecast last month after wet, cold weather reduced
the harvest potential.  Reserves on Aug. 31, 2014 will total 1.949 billion bushels,
down from 2.004 billion forecast in May, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a  report . Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg were expecting 1.829 billion, on average. Production
will total 14.005 billion bushels, down from 14.14 billion
estimated in May. The average projection of 26 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was 13.82 billion.  About 17.67 inches (44.9 centimeters) of rain fell in  Iowa ,
the biggest U.S. producer, from March 1 through May 31, the most
in state records that began in 1873. Some farmers may seed
soybeans instead, which can be planted later in the year, or
leave fields empty in exchange for government subsidized crop-insurance payments. In each of the past three years, the USDA’s
forecasts for record crops proved wrong because of adverse
weather.  U.S. Crop  “The U.S. crop is not as big as forecast earlier this
year, but large enough to rebuild inventories,”  Jerry Gidel ,
the chief feed-grain analyst for Rice Dairy LLC in  Chicago , said
before the report. “The cuts in crop production from wet, cold
planting weather will come slowly because weather in July and
August will determine the size of this year’s crop.”  Farmers will sow 97.3 million acres, unchanged from last
month, the USDA said. Average yields this year may reach 156.5
bushels an acre, down from 158 bushels forecast last month and
up from 123.4 bushels in 2012. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop,
with a 2012 value of $77.4 billion, government figures show.  World  inventories  on Oct. 1, 2014, will total 151.83
million metric tons, down from 154.63 million forecast a month
ago, the USDA said. Analysts expected 151.21 million tons, the
average of 16 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Corn futures through yesterday tumbled 35 percent from a
record $8.49 a bushel in August, joining wheat and soybeans in a
 bear market  as the government forecast increasing supplies after
last year’s drought-reduced crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
