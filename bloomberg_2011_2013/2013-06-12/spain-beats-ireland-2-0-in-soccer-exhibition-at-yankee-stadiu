Spain defeated Ireland 2-0 in a
soccer exhibition at Yankee Stadium in New York.  Substitutes  Roberto Soldado  and  Juan Mata  got the goals for
the world and European champions after 69 and 88 minutes last
night. The result extended Spain’s unbeaten run to 22 games
since a 1-0 loss to England in an exhibition on Nov. 12, 2011.  It was the second soccer game in less than three weeks at
Yankee Stadium after Manchester City beat English Premier League
rival Chelsea 5-3 on May 25. The Yankees are staging events
other than baseball games to recoup the $1.5 billion cost to
build the stadium, which opened in April 2009.  Singers Jay Z and  Justin Timberlake  will play the venue on
July 19 and 20; the  New York Rangers  will take on National
Hockey League opponents the New Jersey Devils and  New York
Islanders  on Jan. 26 and 29, and the Yankees on June 3 said
they’d host college football’s Pinstripe Bowl, first played in
2010, for another 10 years.  Since losing 4-0 in the European Championship a year ago in
its last game against Spain, Ireland has tumbled 23 places in
soccer’s world rankings to No. 41, while Spain has been the No.
1 nation since September 2011.  In 26 meetings between the countries, Spain has won 15
times, while Ireland logged the last of its four victories in
1989.  To contact the reporter on this story:
