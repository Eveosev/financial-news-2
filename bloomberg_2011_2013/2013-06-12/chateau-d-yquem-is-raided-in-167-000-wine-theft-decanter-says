Chateau d’Yquem had 380 half-bottles
of its Sauternes dessert wine valued at 125,400 euros
($167,000) stolen in a raid on its cellars near  Bordeaux  this
week, Decanter.com said.  The missing wine came from its 2010 vintage, and while the
chateau alarm system sounded, the thieves had escaped by the
time police arrived, according to Decanter magazine’s website.
Yquem made no 2012 vintage of its dessert wine, and only
started marketing its 2011s earlier this year, Decanter.com
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
