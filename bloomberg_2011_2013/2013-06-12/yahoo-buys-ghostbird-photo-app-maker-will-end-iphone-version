Yahoo! Inc. is buying GhostBird
Software as Chief Executive Officer  Marissa Mayer  seeks to add
more features to the Flickr image-sharing service in a push to
attract more users on the go.  Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Closely-held
GhostBird, which makes the KitCam and PhotoForge2 photo-editing
apps for mobile devices, will no longer offer them for  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s App Store or develop future versions that work on the
iPhone, Yahoo said in an e-mailed statement today.  Mayer, who last month agreed to pay about $1.1 billion for
the image-based blogging platform Tumblr Inc., has been tweaking
Yahoo’s services and adding features designed to win back users
and advertisers who have fled the Web portal in favor of
competing sites such as  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) 
Improvements to Flickr in December helped Yahoo top 300 million
monthly mobile users, up from just 200 million at the end of the
last year.  GhostBird executives Travis Houlette and Ye Lu will join
the Flickr team, Yahoo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
