Germany’s  Federal Maritime and
Hydrographic Agency  approved the proposed Kaikas offshore wind
farm with 83  wind turbines  in the country’s  North Sea .  The project will be built about 120 kilometers (75 miles)
north of the island of Borkum at water depths of about 40
meters, the agency, known as BSH, said today in an e-mailed
statement. Construction must start by Dec. 31, 2019, it said.  About 98 farms with 7,371 turbines are going through the
approval process after about 30 were already granted, BSH said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
