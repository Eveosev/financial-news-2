The South Korean won halted a two-day decline on speculation exporters are taking advantage of the
currency’s slide to a two-month low to repatriate overseas
income. Government bonds fell.  The won weakened 1.5 percent against the dollar in the past
two days on concern policy makers across the globe will scale
back stimulus that boosted the supply of the greenback. Samsung
Heavy Industries Co., the world’s second-biggest shipbuilder,
got a 1.5 trillion won ($1.3 billion) order for two jack-up rigs,
the company said in a regulatory filing today. Global funds sold
more local shares than they bought for a fourth day, exchange
data show.  The won closed at 1,133.70 per dollar in Seoul, compared
with 1,134.00 yesterday, when it touched 1,137.75, the lowest
level since April 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It rose as much as 0.6 percent earlier in the day to 1,127.32.  “Exporters may have sold the dollar when it was strong and
the news about Samsung Heavy Industries winning orders may have
supported the won,” said Jeon Seung Ji, an analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc. in Seoul.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, fell 18 basis points,
or 0.18 percentage point, to 10.88 percent.  The Bank of  Japan  yesterday refrained from changing the
one-year fixed-rate loan facility the authority has tapped on
seven occasions, while the Federal Reserve has signaled it may
taper its bond purchases.  Default Swaps  South Korea’s unemployment rate rose to 3.2 percent in May,
a government report showed today. That compares with the 3.1
percent median estimate of 12 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The government unveiled a 17.3 trillion won supplementary
budget to support exporters pressured by a weaker Japanese
currency and to spur an economy that expanded last year at the
slowest pace since 2009. South Korea’s low-growth phase may
continue with declines in consumption and investment, the
Finance Ministry said yesterday in a statement.  The yield on the 2.75 percent notes due March 2018 rose 11
basis points to 3.06 percent, prices from Korea Exchange Inc.
show. That’s the highest level for a benchmark five-year
security in almost 10 months.  Policy makers meet tomorrow and will probably keep interest
rates unchanged at 2.5 percent after a cut in May, all 15
economists predicted in a Bloomberg survey.  Five-year credit-default swaps on the nation’s debt touched
a nine-month high of 92 basis points yesterday, according to
data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market. The swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on
a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
