Los Angeles Dodgers and  Arizona 
Diamondbacks players and coaches brawled on the field after a
fourth batter was hit by a pitch during a Major League Baseball
game featuring five ejections.  The tipping point at Dodger Stadium last night was reached
when Los Angeles starting pitcher Zack Greinke was struck on the
left shoulder by an Ian Kennedy pitch in the seventh inning.  The benches had cleared in the sixth without a punch being
thrown when Greinke hit Miguel Montero on the back with a pitch
as payback for Kennedy catching Yasiel Puig on the face with a
fastball in the sixth that ricocheted off the Dodgers rookie’s
shoulder. Greinke also struck Cody Ross in the fifth.  After Greinke was hit, players and coaches exchanged
punches near the Arizona dugout. Kennedy was ejected along with
Arizona manager Kirk Gibson and Diamondbacks assistant hitting
coach Turner Ward. Dodgers hitting coach Mark McGwire and Puig
were also thrown out of the game.  The Dodgers won 5-3 to improve to 28-36, while the
Diamondbacks dropped to 36-29.  Arizona took a 2-0 lead in the fifth as Ross scored after
being struck by Greinke on Jason Kubel’s home run. Andre Ethier
tied it with a two-run homer in the sixth before Willie Bloomquist made it 3-2 to Arizona with a run-scoring single in
the eighth.  Tim Federowicz secured the win for Los Angeles with a
three-run double in the eighth before Mark Ellis became the
fifth batter to be hit by a pitch, by Arizona’s Joe Paterson in
the bottom of the eighth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
