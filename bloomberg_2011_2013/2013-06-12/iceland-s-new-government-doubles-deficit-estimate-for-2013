Iceland’s new government expects the
country’s budget deficit to be double previous estimates as tax
revenue slides and costs rise, according to new calculations
from the  Finance Ministry .  The north Atlantic island’s 2013 deficit is expected to
widen to 50 billion kronur ($415 million), compared with a
December budget estimate of 21 billion kronur. In 2014, the
deficit is expected to widen to 22 billion kronur, compared with
a surplus of 5 billion kronur in an earlier estimate.  Reaching a  budget surplus  “can’t be completed without
considerable arrangements in the state’s finances,” the
ministry said in a statement. Good returns in the state’s
finances are a prerequisite “of conditions being created that
allow for the removal of  capital controls  in the coming years.”  Boosting growth and exiting currency controls -- blocking
as much as $8 billion in kronur denominated assets from leaving
the economy -- are key goals of the new government, which took
office after winning April 27 elections.  Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson pledged on June
10 to push a new “action plan” to cut household debt burdens.
Work on 10 different proposals will begin immediately and be
completed next spring, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
