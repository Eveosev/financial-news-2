Alexander Vik said margin calls by
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  as markets tumbled in October 2008 caused him
so much stress that he was treated in a hospital, according to
evidence given by the Norwegian investor to a London court.  Vik was in a state of “confusion and shock” as Deutsche
Bank demanded hundreds of millions of dollars to cover losses by
a trader, Klaus Said, on behalf of Vik’s Sebastian Holdings
Inc., according to a witness statement released today. Vik, who
thought Said had a $35 million trading limit, said his wife took
him to a Greenwich, Connecticut, hospital where he was given
anxiety medication.  Sebastian Holdings is suing Deutsche Bank for as much as $8
billion in losses and missed profits. Sebastian says  Germany ’s
biggest bank allowed unauthorized trading in its accounts, then
improperly liquidated positions.  Vik, 58, appeared as a witness for the first time today in
the 12-week trial, and answered questions about his wealth and
expertise in financial markets.  “I’m proud of being knowledgeable and experienced in
business,” he said. On individual financial products, “I don’t
have any expertise.”  The Frankfurt-based bank denies doing anything wrong and
says Vik’s fund still owes it money from margin calls. Sebastian Howell, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, declined to comment on the
testimony.  The case is Deutsche Bank AG v. Sebastian Holdings Inc.,
 High Court  of Justice, Queen’s  Bench Division , Commercial Court,
09-83.  To contact the reporter on this story:
