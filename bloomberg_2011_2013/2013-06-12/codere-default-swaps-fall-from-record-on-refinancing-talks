The cost of insuring  Codere SA (CDR) ’s
debt against default fell from a record after the company said
it’s in advanced talks to renew a senior financing facility.  The upfront cost of insuring 10 million euros of the
Madrid-based gaming company’s debt for five years with credit-default swaps fell by 200,000 euros to 3.9 million euros,
according to CMA. That’s in addition to 500,000 euros annually
and signals a 91 percent probability of default, assuming
investors recover 50 percent of their holdings.  Codere said in a regulatory filing that it’s in talks and
no final accord has been reached. Credit-default swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or
the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
