Paris prosecutors opened an
investigation into drug packaging mistakes at a  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  plant in Sens, in north-central
 France , which may have killed six people.  The preliminary inquiry was opened today, Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutors’ office, said
in a telephone interview. The six deaths could be linked to the
erroneous packaging, she said.  A sleeping pill was accidentally put in boxes labeled for
the hypertension generic furosemide, newspapers Le Monde and Le
Figaro reported this week. A recall is underway and Petach
Tikva, Israel-based Teva said yesterday it’s suspended shipments
from the Sens plant.  France’s health-care regulator has found no evidence of
problems in the organization and practices at the Sens plant or
its equipment during an inspection of the facility, the  National
Medicine Security Agency  said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  The company is continuing its internal investigation into
the matter and has started opening, under a court bailiff’s
supervision, blister packs of furosemide, Teva said in an e-mailed statement today. So far, the inspection has found no
Zopiclone sleeping tablets inside the furosemide blisters, Teva
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
