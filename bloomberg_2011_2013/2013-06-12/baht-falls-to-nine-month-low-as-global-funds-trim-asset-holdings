Thailand ’s baht weakened beyond 31
per dollar for the first time since September as international
investors cut holdings of the nation’s assets amid speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will trim its monetary stimulus.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares fell 0.7 percent
today and has lost 8.9 percent since May 22, when Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers could reduce the $85 billion
a month in bond purchases should there be a sustained
improvement in the jobs market. Global funds sold $921 million
more Thai stocks than they bought this month through yesterday
and pulled a net $158 million from bonds, official data show.  “Funds are leaving Thailand and that is weighing on the
baht,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a Bangkok-based foreign-exchange
trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “Fund movements by
foreign investors are a major driver for the baht, while both
importers and exporters have taken a wait-and-see attitude.”  The baht fell 0.3 percent to 31.08 per dollar as of 9:25
a.m. in Bangkok and touched 31.10 earlier, the weakest level
since Sept. 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 22 basis points, or
0.22 percentage point, to 7.32 percent. The gauge last reached
that level in December 2011.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 rose one basis point to 3.99 percent, the highest level
since September 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
