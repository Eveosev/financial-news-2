Illinois debt is trading at the
highest average yield in almost nine months as investors demand
greater returns to hold the securities following credit
downgrades by Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.  Taxable Illinois pension-obligation bonds maturing in June
2033 traded yesterday at an average yield of about 5.42 percent,
the highest since Sept. 17, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
securities averaged about 96 cents on the dollar, down from 101
cents May 17. The yield climbed to about 2.63 percentage points
more than benchmark Treasuries, the biggest amount since May 9.  Moody’s cut its rating on Illinois debt to A3, the lowest
of any U.S. state and six steps below top-graded, on June 6
after lawmakers left the capital May 31 without passing bills to
to reduce a $97 billion unfunded pension liability. The
downgrade spurred Democratic Governor  Pat Quinn  to call a
special legislative session on June 19 to consider measures to
fix the worst-funded state pension system.  Fitch lowered its rating on Illinois debt on June 3 to A-,
the equivalent of Moody’s grade, citing the pension deficit.  The state’s taxable bonds, considered a benchmark by
Citigroup Inc., had their biggest monthly rally in at least
three years in May as lawmakers took up pension changes from the
Speaker of the  House of Representatives , Michael Madigan, and
from Senate President John Cullerton, both Democrats. None
passed.  Since May 31, the yield on the bonds has jumped 0.26
percentage point, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
