Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s incoming
chairman said he wants the sports car the company is developing
with  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  to be a midsize vehicle
comparable to the discontinued Supra.  Takeshi Uchiyamada has been telling people that Toyota’s
next sports car should be like the Supra so that it doesn’t
overlap with the 86 coupe, he said in an interview yesterday in
 Osaka  at a gathering of members of the Keidanren,  Japan ’s
biggest business lobbying group. Still, such decisions are up to
engineers, Uchiyamada said.  “That’s what I want but it’s not me who makes the
decision,” said Uchiyamada, who’s known within Toyota as the
“father of the Prius” for his work developing the world’s
best-selling gasoline-electric car. “It’s futile if we make
something similar” to the 86, he said.  Toyota and BMW announced this year they will jointly
produce a midsize sports car as part of a broader collaboration
between the two. Should Uchiyamada, who’s leading the
negotiations with BMW, get his wish, Toyota would be reviving a
model that was last produced in  1999  after a 20-year run.  Toyota spokesman Naoto Fuse declined to comment beyond
saying nothing has been decided.  Uchiyamada, 66, is scheduled to become Toyota’s next
chairman at the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting this
week, replacing Fujio Cho, who will become honorary chairman.
