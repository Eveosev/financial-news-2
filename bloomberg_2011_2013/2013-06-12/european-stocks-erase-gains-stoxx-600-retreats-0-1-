European stocks erased gains,
leaving the region’s benchmark little changed, as investors
weighed the outlook for central bank stimulus. Asian shares
declined, while U.S. futures climbed.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.1 percent to 291.54 at
9:21 a.m. in  London  after earlier climbing as much as 0.3
percent. The gauge has lost 6.2 percent since May 22 amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will taper its bond-buying
program that helped drive the measure to its highest level since
June 2008.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.1 percent, while
contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures advanced
0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
