Kuwait invited proposals for the
first phase of a renewable-energy park as it plans to generate
15 percent of its electricity from sustainable sources by 2030.  Only prequalified groups will be eligible to bid for the 70
megawatts of projects, said Salem Al-Hajraf, executive director
of the energy research center at the  Kuwait Institute for
Scientific Research . They include eight groups for a solar-thermal plant, 13 for a photovoltaic site and 16 for wind farms.  Kuwait, the third-biggest oil producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is investing in alternative
energy to save more crude for export. The Arab state, which
doesn’t yet generate any power from clean sources, will produce
1 percent from renewables after building the park’s first phase.  The Shagaya energy park, to be located in a desert area 100
kilometers (62 miles) west of  Kuwait City , will have a 2,000-megawatt capacity when all phases are completed. It will save
about 12 million barrels of oil equivalent a year, Al-Hajraf
said today in a presentation.  Phase one, scheduled for completion in the first half of
2016, will be funded by the government. The park will be
finished by 2030, according to Al-Hajraf, who declined to
estimate a cost for the project or name the prequalified groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
