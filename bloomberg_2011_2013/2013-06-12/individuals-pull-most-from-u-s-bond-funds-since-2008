Investors pulled $10.9 billion from
U.S. bond mutual funds in the past week, the biggest redemption
since October 2008, after speculation that the Federal Reserve
may scale back its bond buying sent fixed-income markets lower.  Taxable bond funds suffered withdrawals of $8.7 billion and
municipal bond funds lost $2.3 billion in the week ended June 5,
according to an e-mailed statement from the Investment Company
Institute, a Washington-based trade group. Investors withdrew
$942 million from stock funds, the ICI reported.  Retail and institutional investors have been dumping bonds
since Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress on May 22 that
the central bank’s policy-setting board could start scaling back
its bond purchases in its “next few meetings” if the U.S.
employment outlook shows sustained improvement. Global bond
markets posted their biggest monthly losses in nine years in
May.  Individual investors typically own bonds through mutual
funds. Institutional investors are big buyers of exchange-traded
bond funds, which have also experienced redemptions according to
Denver-based Lipper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
