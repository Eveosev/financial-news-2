Here are the reported first quarter of
2013  earnings per share  for companies in the  Standard & Poorâ€™s (SPX)  500
Index. Companies are divided by their reported year-over-year EPS
differences (higher, lower, unchanged, reversals). Within groups, the
companies are ranked by year-over-year percent changes.  Profit figures are based on income from continuing operations
excluding some gains and losses.  Earnings estimates  are provided by
Bloomberg.  
NM -- The calculations of percentage changes between profit and loss
and vice versa are not meaningful, hence not calculated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
