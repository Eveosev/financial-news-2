Brazil ’s real swung between gains
and losses a day after the central bank sold $2.2 billion of
swap contracts to stem the currency’s two-month selloff.  The real dropped 0.4 percent to 2.1408 per dollar at 10:44
a.m. in Sao Paulo, erasing gains that earlier took it to as
strong as 2.1242 per dollar. Yields on interest-rate futures
contracts were mixed, with the rate on the benchmark contract
due in January climbing two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 8.72 percent.  The central bank’s sale of $2.2 billion in currency swaps
yesterday followed the auction of $2.1 billion worth of the
contracts the day before that.  To contact the reporters on this story:
