Ibovespa futures rose, a sign the
gauge may rebound after sinking more than 20 percent from a peak
in January, before  Brazil  announces measures to curb inflation
while boosting demand.  Biofuel producer  Cosan SA Industria e Comercio (CSAN3)  may move
after announcing a program to buy back as many as 4.6 million
shares in one year. Papermaker  Klabin SA (KLBN3)  may be active after
approving a public offering of as much as 1.7 billion reais
($800 million) in units.  Ibovespa  futures  contracts expiring in June advanced 1.2
percent to 50,305 at 9:06 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real
strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.1279 per dollar. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials added 0.1 percent,
boosting the prospects for Brazilian raw materials exporters.  The Brazilian benchmark stock gauge fell 21 percent from
its Jan. 3 bull market high to 49,769.93 at the close of trading
yesterday on concern accelerating inflation may curb Brazil’s
economic recovery and the government’s interventionist policies
will hurt profit in industries including utilities and energy.  The gauge’s 14-day relative index plunged to 22. A reading
below the 30 level indicates to some analysts that a security or
index is oversold and poised to rebound.  President Dilma Rousseff will announce today subsidized
credit for the purchase of furniture and home appliances, as the
government seeks to reverse slowing consumption. Rousseff’s
administration is also considering budget spending cuts and a
credible fiscal target in order to show commitment to fiscal
austerity, newspaper Valor Economico reported today, citing
unnamed people at the government.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.9 times
analysts’  earnings estimates  for the next four quarters,
compared with a multiple of 10.4 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume  for stocks in Sao Paulo was 8.3 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.7 billion
reais this year through June 11, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
