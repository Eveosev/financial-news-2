Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA) , the company
controlled by billionaire  John Malone , announced the start of a
$3.5 billion stock repurchase program and said it intends to
complete the buyback over the next two years.  Under the plan, Liberty Global may acquire Class A shares,
Class C shares or any combination, it said in a statement
yesterday.  The buyback follows the cable giant’s acquisition in Europe
of Virgin Media Inc. for about $24 billion including debt, to
expand in the U.K. A previously announced $1 billion stock
repurchase program is no longer applicable, the company said.  The new buyback plan represents 13 percent of Liberty
Global’s $27 billion market value. The  company ’s purchase of
Virgin Media was completed earlier this month.  Shares of Liberty Global, based in Englewood,  Colorado ,
slipped 1.4 percent to $73.15 at the close in New York
yesterday. They’ve gained 16 percent this year, ahead of the 14
percent advance by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
