U.K. stocks retreated for a third
day amid an increase in mergers-and-acquisition activity.  Severn Trent Plc plunged 7.9 percent as a deadline for a
takeover offer expired. Vodafone Group Plc lost 1.2 percent
after the world’s second-largest wireless carrier confirmed it
approached Kabel Deutschland Holding AG about a takeover.  The FTSE 100 Index fell 13.96 points, or 0.2 percent,
to 6,326.12 at 9:21 a.m. in London. The equity benchmark has
lost 7.5 percent since Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said May 22 that the central bank may scale back stimulus if the
 U.S. economy  improves sustainably. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index also slid 0.2 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index gained 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
