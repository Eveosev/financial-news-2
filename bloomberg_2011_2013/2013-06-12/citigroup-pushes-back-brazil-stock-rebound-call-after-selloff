Citigroup Inc. (C)  tempered its
projections for a recovery in Brazilian stocks after the
Ibovespa plunged into a  bear market , predicting that the
benchmark won’t rebound until next year.  The 71-stock index has plunged more than 22 percent in 2013
from its peak of 63,312.46 on Jan. 3. Citigroup analysts  Stephen Graham  and Nicolas Riva, who had forecast a return to a level of
63,000 by the end of this year, now project that the measure
will rebound by mid-2014, according to a research note dated
yesterday. The bank had already cut its year-end Ibovespa target
twice this year, according to the note.  “The second half is only three weeks away, and things have
just gotten uglier,” the analysts wrote. “Growth expectations
around 4 percent are a distant memory.”  The Ibovespa fell 0.9 percent to 49,304.44 at 3:13 p.m. in
Sao Paulo today. Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge has plunged as
faltering growth drove down consumer stocks and raw-material
exporters slid with commodities on concern about global monetary
stimulus. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell 12 percent during
the same period while the MSCI Global Index gained 7.1 percent.  Latin America’s largest economy expanded 0.6 percent in the
first three months of 2013, below the 0.9 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Economists expect Brazil’s gross
domestic product to expand 2.5 percent this year, down from 3.2
percent in January, according to a central bank weekly survey
published on June 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
