Virgin Money Holdings U.K. Ltd., the
bank that bought Northern Rock Plc, is starting to search for
advisers for an initial public offering, according to a person
with knowledge of the matter.  The search for banking and legal advisers for the share
sale is at an early stage and no shortlist or date has been set,
said the person, who requested anonymity because the process is
private.  Northern Rock was nationalized in February 2008 after
suffering the first run on a U.K. bank in more than a century.
Virgin Money agreed to buy part of the bank in November 2011 for
an initial 747 million pounds ($1.2 billion) after it had been
divided, leaving taxpayers with stakes in  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc ,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and other mortgage assets.  The government will receive as much as 80 million pounds in
cash if Virgin makes a profitable IPO within five years of the
2011 purchase, U.K. Financial Investments, which manages the
government’s stake, said at the time.  Billionaire investor Richard Branson’s Virgin Group and WL
Ross & Co., a New York-based investment firm, each own stakes of
about 45 percent in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England-based Virgin
Money, the company has said.  A Virgin Money spokesman declined to comment. Sky News
reported the share sale preparations earlier today.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
