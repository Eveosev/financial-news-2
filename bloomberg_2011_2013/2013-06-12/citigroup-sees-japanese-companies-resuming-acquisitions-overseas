Citigroup Inc. (C)  said Japanese
companies will resume takeovers abroad as they adjust to a
weaker yen and the shrinking population continues to limit
business expansion at home.  “Japan will see signs of a recovery in cross-border
acquisitions later this year, based on the pipeline of deals
we’re working on now,” Yuichi Jimbo, head of  investment banking 
at Citigroup Global Capital Markets Japan Inc., said in Tokyo
today. “We may be able to announce some deals.”  Mergers and acquisitions by Japanese firms abroad have
fallen to $10.6 billion this year from a record $112 billion for
all of 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yen has
weakened about 10 percent against the dollar this year, making
it more costly for companies to make takeovers overseas.  Japanese firms operating in the pharmaceutical, natural
resource and consumer industries are among those that continue
to go abroad for growth, Jimbo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
