Opera Software ASA (OPERA) , the Norwegian
maker of Internet browsers, rose the most in almost seven months
as a deal to supply its Skyfire software to an unidentified
mobile operator signals that its strategy is working.  Shares in the Oslo-based company rose as much as 6.4
percent, the biggest intraday increase since Nov. 20, and were
up 4.3 percent at 43.9 kroner as of 3:13 p.m. in the Norwegian
capital. About 437,000 shares have traded so far today, more
than 60 percent above the three-month daily average.  “Operators are starting to use cloud solution technology,
instead of just hardware,” Andre Holo Adolfsen, an analyst at
Nordea Securities, said by telephone from Oslo. This is proof
that the concept of Skyfire works and that operators are willing
to install the software and technology in their networks, he
said.  Opera, which competes with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  browsers, is seeking to boost sales by targeting
the growing mobile-phone data market for its cross-platform
Internet browser. It plans to increase revenue this year by as
much as 37 percent  from $216 million last year .  Opera signed a three-year global frame agreement with an
unidentified “major international mobile operator” to supply
Skyfire’s Rocket Optimizer cloud technology across the
operator’s network, the company said in a statement.  “Skyfire was a smart and cheap acquisition,” said Holo
Adolfsen, who recommends that clients buy the stock. “The
upside is tremendous.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
