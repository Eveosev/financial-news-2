Goldman Sachs Group Inc. maintained
its neutral recommendation on commodity prices, predicting a
significant decline in agriculture in the second half of the
year even if the summer weather is worse than in 2011.  Returns for commodities, measured by the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Enhanced Index, will be 2.3 percent over 12 months, Goldman
analysts including  Jeffrey Currie  and Damien Courvalin wrote in
a report today. That’s more than the 1.6 percent gain the bank
predicted on May 14.  “Prices are unlikely to collapse from current levels as
demand is not weak enough to create large unexpected inventory
builds while supply rarely creates a surge in inventory like
what demand can do when it falls unexpectedly,” they said.  Goldman and Citigroup Inc. have predicted the end of the
decade-long  bull market  in commodities after prices that more
than doubled in 10 years spurred expansions at mines, farms and
oil fields. Gluts are emerging as the  International Monetary
Fund  predicts global growth of 3.3 percent this year from 3.2
percent in 2012.  Agricultural commodities face “significant downside
potential” as harvests in  Latin America  and  North America 
replenish world inventories should weather in the U.S. not be
too detrimental to yields, said Goldman.  Farm View  “Even should summer weather be slightly worse than in
2011, U.S. corn inventories would still recover and prices
decline relative to current levels, reinforcing our negative
agriculture view,” the analysts said.  Production of corn in the U.S., the world’s largest grower,
declined 0.7 percent to 313.95 million metric tons in the year
that began September 2011, after parts of the Midwest had the
hottest summer since 1955. The crop slumped a further 13 percent
in 2012 amid the worst drought since the 1930s, reducing
 stockpiles  before this year’s harvest to the smallest since
1996, and pushing prices to a record last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
