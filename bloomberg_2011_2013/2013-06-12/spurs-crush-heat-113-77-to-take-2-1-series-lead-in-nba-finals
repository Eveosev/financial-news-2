Journeymen Danny Green and Gary Neal
combined for 51 points and the  San Antonio  Spurs held  LeBron James  in check again to beat the defending champion Miami Heat
113-77 and take a two-games-to-one lead in the National
Basketball Association Finals.  The host Spurs made an NBA Finals-record 16 3-pointers last
night while holding four-time Most Valuable Player James to 15
points, his lowest postseason scoring total since 2011.  “We got what we deserved,” Miami coach  Erik Spoelstra 
said in a news conference. “We did not bring anywhere near our
best game tonight. I did not recognize the team that was out
there.”  Game 4 in the best-of-seven championship series is set for
tomorrow night in San Antonio.  Green, 25, who was cut twice by the Spurs and spent part of
the 2011 season playing in Slovenia, went 7-of-9 on 3-pointers
to lead the Spurs with 27 points. Green, from North Babylon on
New York’s Long Island, was a former teammate of James in
Cleveland.  Neal, 28, who played in  Turkey , Spain and Italy before
joining the Spurs in 2010, hit six more 3-pointers off the bench
to add 24 points.  “They were huge for us, those guys shot incredibly and
gave us some breathing room when we needed it,” Spurs center
 Tim Duncan  said in a news conference. “It’s an unbelievable
story to see where they came from.”  The Spurs outrebounded the Heat 52-36 and held James below
20 points for the third straight game.  James Struggling  James missed 11 of his first 13 shots and had only four
points until late in the third quarter. After scoring at least
19 in every playoff game the past two seasons, James has had 18,
17 and 15 points in the three games against the Spurs.  “We know what kind of player LeBron is and he’s not at his
best now,” Green told reporters. “With LeBron, it’s not just
us stopping him. He’s kind of stopping himself out there.”  It was the 100th postseason victory for the Spurs’ trio of
Duncan,  Tony Parker  and  Manu Ginobili , second in NBA history to
the 110 wins for the Lakers’  Magic Johnson ,  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
and Michael Cooper.  None of the Spurs’ three veterans had a big game at the
AT&T Center in San Antonio. Duncan had 12 points, Ginobili had
seven and Parker had six points while missing most of the second
half with what appeared to be a leg injury.  The Spurs led 50-44 at halftime and expanded their lead to
59-46 early in the third period and to 73-52 with just under
three minutes left in the quarter.  ‘Outclassed Us’  San Antonio led 78-63 entering the fourth quarter and
scored the first 13 points of the period to take a 28-point lead.  Mike Miller went 5-for-5 on 3-pointers to score 15 points
for Miami, which never led in the game.  Dwyane Wade  led the Heat
with 16 points.  Spoelstra said Miami’s shortcomings were evident on both
offense and defense.  “We’re kidding ourselves if we’re going to point to the 77
points,” he told reporters. “They played with more force and
focus. They outclassed us from the opening tip.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
