Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed for the first time in more than a week after an Energy
Information Administration report showed stockpiles of the
biofuel at the lowest on record.  The spread, or price difference, contracted 0.5 cent to
37.91 cents a gallon after the Energy Department’s analytical
arm said inventories dropped 2.6 percent to 16 million barrels
in the week ended June 7, the lowest level in records going back
to June 2010. Production declined by 1,000 barrels a day to
884,000.  “Stocks are now at the lowest level since the EIA began
reporting the data,” said  Terry Reilly , a senior commodity
analyst at Futures International LLC in Chicago. “That is
friendly to the ethanol market, which limited losses today.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery fell 0.8 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.431 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 11 percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery declined 1.3 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.8101 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, the highest level in two weeks,
the EIA report showed.  Gasoline  demand  sank 2 percent to 8.65
million barrels a day, down 5.3 percent from a year earlier.  Ethanol is made primarily from corn in the U.S. One bushel
makes at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel. Last year’s
drought devastated crops for the fuel and slashed returns for
making the additive.  Corn for July delivery slipped 8.75 cents, or 1.3 percent,
to $6.5075 a bushel in  Chicago . The corn crush spread, or the
cost difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed
to make it, was 6 cents, up from 4 cents yesterday.  The U.S. hasn’t made any  foreign purchases  of ethanol since
May 24, the EIA said today.  Each gallon of ethanol is assigned a tracking certificate
known as a Renewable Identification Number, or RIN. A refiner
can keep the credit to show compliance with federal blending
mandates, or trade it.  Corn-based ethanol RINs for 2013  were unchanged at 87
cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which
cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, were
steady at 95 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol dropped 8 cents to $2.51 a
gallon in Chicago, 7.5 cents to $2.61 on the  Gulf Coast  and 6
cents to $2.63 in  New York , data compiled by Bloomberg show. On
the West Coast, the biofuel was unchanged at $2.83 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf expanded 7.5
cents to 22 cents, the widest since April 18, while Chicago’s
discount to New York Harbor grew by 2 cents to 12 cents, the
largest differential since May 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
