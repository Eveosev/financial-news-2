Indonesia  stocks  rose, snapping
four-days slide, following the biggest selling of the nation’s
shares by overseas investors since March 2011.  The Jakarta Composite Index jumped 1.9 percent to close at
4,697.88, rebounding from its lowest level since Feb. 19 and
paring its decline from a May 20 peak to 9.9 percent. PT Astra
International jumped 7.5 percent and PT Unilever Indonesia
soared 9.5 percent, ending a four-day, 14 percent plunge.  Foreign investors pulled $405 million from Indonesian
 equities  yesterday, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg,
taking outflows for this month to $1.04 billion. The nation’s
stocks had fallen with equities in neighboring  Thailand  and the
 Philippines  since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
on May 22 the central bank could consider paring stimulus if the
U.S. labor market improves.  “It’s just bargain hunting. Local funds are still holding
lots of cash,” Laurentia Amica Darmawan, who helps manage $530
million at PT First State Investments  Indonesia , said by phone
in Jakarta. “With some stocks already 30 percent below their
peak, they are comfortable to get in.”  Indonesia’s rupiah forwards rose the most in a year after
the central bank increased the rate it pays lenders on overnight
deposits in a preemptive step to maintain monetary stability.
Government bonds gained.  One-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 1.7 percent,
the most since June 2012, to 10,110 per dollar, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The contracts touched 10,412 yesterday, the
weakest level since August 2009. In the spot market, the rupiah
fell 0.3 percent to 9,860, taking its decline this week to 0.6
percent.  Bank Indonesia raised the deposit facility rate, known as
the Fasbi, by a quarter-percentage point to 4.25 percent
effective today, the central bank said in a statement on its
website. Indonesia has recorded six consecutive quarterly
current-account shortfalls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
