Etablissements Maurel & Prom (MAU) , a
French oil and gas explorer, denied being subject to action by
Gabon’s government for breaching contracts and evading taxes,
citing a letter from Petroleum Minister Etienne Ngoubou.  An audit by Gabon of Maurel’s operations in the country
found no breaches, Ngoubou said in a letter to Maurel. The
correspondence, dated yesterday, was provided by the French
company and confirmed by the ministry.  The letter rebuts speculation last week by consulting firm
Eurasia Group that the French oil explorer may be the next
target of a government crackdown over production contracts.
Gabon’s oil ministry plans to seize an oil field from China
Petrochemical Corp.’s Addax Petroleum.  Gabon’s audit of Maurel “did not find  tax evasion  or non-respect of contractual clauses,” the letter said.  Maurel on June 10 denied it is the subject of any tax
litigation in Gabon and said it “largely exceeds” contractual
commitments regarding exploration spending, investment, use of
local labor and support for regional development.  Ngoubou won’t renew Addax’s license at the Tsiengui field
because it had breached the law, a ministry official said June
6. Two other companies face similar actions, the official said,
declining to name them.  Founded in 1998, New York-based Eurasia offers worldwide
research on political risk, according to its website.  Maurel “categorically denies the remarks” made by
Eurasia, the French explorer said.  The shares fell 1 percent to 12.07 euros in Paris today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
