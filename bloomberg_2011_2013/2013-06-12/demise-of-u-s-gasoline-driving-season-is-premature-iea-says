The traditional peak for gasoline
use in the U.S. from late May to early September remains
significant and suggestions that seasonality in demand has faded
are premature, the  International Energy Agency  said.  U.S. gasoline consumption will rise by about 300,000
barrels a day this summer, known as the national driving season,
the IEA said. The forecast increase will follow less pronounced
seasonal growth in 2008 and 2009, when the global recession
affected demand, it said.  The U.S. remains the world’s largest gasoline consumer,
with average use of about 8.7 million barrels a day last year,
the IEA said today in its monthly Oil Market Report. That’s
equivalent to almost 10 percent of global demand and is as large
as the combined total consumption of Mexico,  Canada , Germany,
 France  and  New Zealand , according to the Paris-based agency.  Demand in the U.S. is set to decline by 0.1 percent in 2013
as cars become more fuel-efficient, a pattern that will probably
continue in coming years, the IEA said.  “This downwardly sloping trend in U.S. gasoline demand is
nevertheless expected to remain consistent with continued
seasonality in demand patterns,” the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
