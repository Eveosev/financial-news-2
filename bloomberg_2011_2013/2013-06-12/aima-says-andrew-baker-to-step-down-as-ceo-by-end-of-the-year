The Alternative Investment
Management Association , a lobbying organization that represents
more than 1,300 hedge-fund firms, said  Andrew Baker  plans to
step down as chief executive officer by the end of the year.  AIMA is in the process of identifying a successor, the
London-based group said in a statement today. Baker, 56, has
been CEO since 2009.  Baker plans to leave as European regulators implement the
 Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive , which lays out
disclosure and fundraising requirements for  hedge funds  across
the region. The industry successfully watered down earlier
proposals that would have restricted hedge-fund leverage and
implemented higher hurdles to raising money in  Europe .  Baker said he is looking forward to “future challenges,”
according to the statement. An AIMA spokesman, Christen Thomson,
said Baker wasn’t available to discuss what he plans to do next.  Baker will stay on as CEO until his successor is appointed,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
