Ultra-low-sulfur diesel rose as
gasoil gained in  Europe  and the  International Energy Agency 
forecast tighter North Sea crude supplies this summer.  Futures advanced as gasoil jumped 1.1 percent on the ICE
Futures Exchange in London. Higher prices can attract more
imports from the U.S. Brent crude climbed 0.7 percent after the
IEA said summer maintenance at North Sea fields could be
lengthier and more extensive than usual. Crack spreads widened.  “The IEA said crude supplies short-term may tighten even
though they lowered demand expectations,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “That
gave us some support.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for July delivery rose 2.79 cents,
or 1 percent, to $2.8854 a gallon at 10:02 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 24 percent below the
100-day average for the time of day.  The July ULSD contract’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 66
cents to $25.30 a barrel, the first gain since June 4. The
 premium over Brent  rose 66 cents to $17.72.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported
yesterday that  distillate supplies  rose 199,000 barrels last
week and  gasoline inventories  increased 1.04 million barrels.  The Energy information Administration is scheduled to
report last week’s inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in
 Washington . The report will probably show that distillate
supplies climbed 1.5 million barrels and gasoline stockpiles
gained 500,000 barrels, according to the median of 11 analyst
 estimates  surveyed by Bloomberg.  Supply Build  “The market is expecting a build,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for July delivery rose 0.56 cent to $2.8287 a
gallon on trading volume that was 37 percent below the 100-day
average.  July gasoline’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate
narrowed 27 cents to $22.92 a barrel. Gasoline’s  premium  over
Brent slipped 20 cents to $15.41.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.1 cent to
$3.634 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices
