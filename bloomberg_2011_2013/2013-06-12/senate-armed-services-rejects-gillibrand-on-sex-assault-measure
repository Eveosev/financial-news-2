The Senate Armed Services Committee
rejected Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s measure to take sex-assault cases and other major crimes in the U.S. military out of
the chain of command  Gillibrand, a  New York  Democrat, proposed that such cases
be handled by independent military prosecutors, a change opposed
by top military leaders.  The panel voted, 17-9, to accept instead an alternative by
SenatorCarl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the
committee. His measure would require high-level review whenever
a commanding officer decided against pursuing prosecution of a
sex-assault allegation.  Levin was joined in opposing Gillibrand’s approach by
members including Senator  Claire McCaskill , a Missouri Democrat,
who has been among women in the Senate demanding stronger action
to act on sexual wrongdoing in the military.  To contact the reporter on this story:
