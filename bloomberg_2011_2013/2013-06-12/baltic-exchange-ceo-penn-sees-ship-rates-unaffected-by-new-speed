Following are comments from Jeremy Penn, chief executive officer of the Baltic Exchange, about the
assumptions shipbrokers should make when submitting rate
estimates for Capesize vessels that carry iron ore.  The bourse said today brokers should assume vessel speeds
of 12 knots with a cargo and 13 knots without, for fuel
consumption of 44 metric tons a day. Guidance in its manual for
panelists currently stipulates 14.5 knots and 15 knots,
respectively, giving daily usage of 56 tons. Slow-steaming
denotes speed cuts aimed at curbing use of fuel, the industry’s
biggest expense.  “The panelists report the prevailing market rate for
Baltic ships on Baltic routes. Increasingly, that’s been a slow-steaming market, and they have been reporting rates that reflect
that.”  There shouldn’t be a “significant” alteration to the
exchange’s published Capesize rates as a result of today’s
guidance to assume lower speeds and fuel consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
