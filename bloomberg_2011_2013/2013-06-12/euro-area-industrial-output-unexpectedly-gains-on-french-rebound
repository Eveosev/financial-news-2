Euro-area industrial output unexpectedly increased in April, led by  France , adding to signs the currency bloc’s economy is beginning to emerge from a record-long recession.  Factory production in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.4 percent from March, when it increased a revised 0.9 percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The  median forecast  in a Bloomberg News survey of 36 economists was for stagnation. Production fell 0.6 percent from April 2012.  The  euro-zone  economy is forecast to stagnate in the second quarter before gross domestic product returns to growth, according to a separate Bloomberg survey of economists. GDP fell 0.2 percent in the first quarter, a  sixth consecutive contraction . The  European Central Bank  left its  benchmark interest rate  at a record low 0.5 percent last week.  Today’s report “lifts hopes that the sector will expand significantly in the second quarter and help the euro zone dodge a seventh successive quarter of GDP contraction,” said  Howard Archer , chief U.K. and European economist at IHS Global Insight in London.  The euro was down 0.2 percent against the dollar at 12:11 p.m. in Brussels, trading at $1.3291. Europe’s benchmark  Stoxx 600 index  was up 0.5 percent to 293.21.  French Rebound  Industrial output in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, expanded 1.2 percent in April after a 1.8 percent increase a month earlier, today’s report showed. French output rebounded with 2.3 percent growth after a 0.6 percent contraction. Production in  Italy  and  Spain  decreased.  Production of capital goods rose 2.7 percent in April after a 1.2 percent gain a month earlier. Output of non-durable  consumer goods  was up 0.7 percent after a 0.1 percent decline. Energy production was down 1.5 percent.  Euro-area  manufacturing output  shrank less than initially estimated in May, though the gauge has been below 50, indicating contraction, since July 2011, London-based Markit Economists said on June 3.  “Euro-zone manufacturers are being helped by softer oil and commodity prices, which are easing pressure on their margins and giving them more scope to price competitively,” Archer said.
