Gold swung between gains and losses
near a two-week low in London as investors weighed speculation
the U.S. Federal Reserve will curb stimulus against a weakening
dollar.  Data released last week showed U.S. payrolls increased more
than forecast in May, and Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last
month that the central bank could curtail its $85 billion
monthly bond purchases if the economy improves. The dollar was
little changed against six major currencies after falling to the
lowest level since Feb. 21 yesterday.  “There’s a tug of war between investors putting money into
gold and taking it out,” Bernard Sin, head of currency and
metal trading at bullion refiner MKS ( Switzerland ) SA in Geneva,
said today by phone. “One of the concerns that investors are
worried about is if there’s no more quantitative easing. We’ve
seen some scattered buying on the back of the weak dollar.”  Gold for immediate delivery was little changed at $1,377.18
an ounce by 9:37 a.m. in  London . Prices rose as much as 0.1
percent and fell as much as 0.3 percent after reaching $1,366.19
yesterday, the lowest level since May 23. Bullion for August
delivery was unchanged at $1,377 on the Comex in  New York .
Futures trading volume was 51 percent below the average in the
past 100 days for this time of day, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Gold Prices  Prices slid 18 percent this year as an improving U.S.
economy increased speculation the Fed may taper quantitative-easing measures that helped bullion cap a 12-year bull run in
2012. The  Bank of Japan  yesterday refrained from adding stimulus
or expanding its toolkit for tackling volatility in bonds.
 Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s largest gold producer, said
last week it will write down the value of its assets by as much
as A$6 billion ($5.7 billion) after the slump in prices.  Gold will continue to decline over the medium-term on a re-acceleration in U.S. growth and a further unwinding of exchange-traded fund positions, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report
today. The bank sees the metal trading at $1,345 in 12 months.  Holdings in  exchange-traded products  fell 2.3 metric tons
to 2,127.5 tons yesterday, the lowest since April 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver for immediate delivery rose 0.6 percent to $21.8035
an ounce in London. Platinum added 0.2 percent to $1,482.53 an
ounce. Palladium was down 0.3 percent at $751.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
