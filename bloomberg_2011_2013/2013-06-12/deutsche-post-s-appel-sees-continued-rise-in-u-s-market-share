Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  has won market
share from competitors  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and  United Parcel Service
Inc. (UPS)  in the past two years in the U.S., and plans to continue
the push after building new express hubs and modernizing its
vehicle fleets in North and South America.  “We are head-to-head competitors with UPS and FedEx, the
difference is that we have won market share in the U.S. in the
last two years,” Chief Executive Officer Frank Appel said today
in an interview on Bloomberg Television. The company plans to
continue wrestling share from these rivals in its express,
supply chain and global forwarding units in North and South
America, he said.  A free trade agreement between the European Union and the
U.S. may generate at least 1 percent of additional growth in
both regions, Appel said. U.S. and European leaders have shown
increased interest in opening the $15 trillion  U.S. economy  to
the $13.1 trillion of goods and services produced by the 17-nation euro region.  The move would create the world’s largest free-trade zone.
Companies like Deutsche Post, which claims the lead in the
global air freight market and is also among the largest sea
freight senders, would be beneficiaries of increased trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
