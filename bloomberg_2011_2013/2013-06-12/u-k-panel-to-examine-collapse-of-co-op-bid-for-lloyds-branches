The U.K. Parliament’s Treasury
Committee announced an inquiry into the collapse of a bid by the
Co-Operative Bank Plc to buy 632 branches of Lloyds TSB Bank
Plc.  The first evidence session into the proposed takeover known
as “Project Verde” will take place on June 18 with António
Horta-Osório, group chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group Plc,
and Winfried Bischoff, its chairman.  “This divestment should be an important opportunity to
boost competition in the U.K. retail banking market,” the
committee’s chairman,  Andrew Tyrie , said in an e-mailed
statement. “It could have significant benefits for consumers.
We will want to know how the Co-operative Bank’s bid was allowed
to progress to such an advanced stage, why it collapsed and what
will now happen to these branches and their customers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
