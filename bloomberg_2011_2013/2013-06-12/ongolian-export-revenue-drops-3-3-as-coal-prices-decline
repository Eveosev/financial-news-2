Mineral-rich Mongolia’s export
income dropped in the first five months of this year as a result
of falling coal prices paid by  China , the nation’s largest
trading partner.  Mongolia’s exports fell 3.3 percent to $1.64 billion in the
first five months of this year from the same period last year,
the  National Statistics Office  said in a  release  on its website
yesterday. The value of coal shipments declined 44 percent to
$448.6 million, while volumes dropped 14 percent to 6.33 million
tons, according to the statement.  In April, the  World Bank  cut a forecast for 2013 Mongolian
economic growth to 13 percent from 16 percent, citing declines
in exports and foreign investment.  Economic growth in China ,
which bought 87 percent of Mongolian exports in five months
through May, slowed to 7.7 percent in the first quarter from 7.9
percent in the last three months of 2012.  Imports were $2.47 billion in the period, down 6.8 percent
from the same period a year earlier, leaving a trade deficit of
$824.7 million, according to the statistics bureau.  The value of gold shipments more than tripled to $126.2
million in the first five months from $38.9 million a year ago,
according to the agency. Three tons of gold was exported
compared with 0.9 tons a year earlier, the statistics office
said.  Mongolia exported 1.79 million barrels of oil during the
first five months of the year, up from 1.26 million barrels a
year earlier, the statistics office said. The value of the
exports rose 33 percent to $169.5 million this year.  Exports of  iron ore  were 2.32 million tons during the first
five months of the year, falling from 2.39 million tons in the
same period last year, the statistics office said. The value of
the shipments rose 56 percent to $262.4 million from $168.2
million a year ago, according to the agency.  The nation’s consumer prices rose 9.7 percent in May from a
year earlier and gained 0.3 percent from April, the agency  said .
The number of registered unemployed fell to 40,500, the
statistics office said, a 30 percent decrease from the same
period last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
