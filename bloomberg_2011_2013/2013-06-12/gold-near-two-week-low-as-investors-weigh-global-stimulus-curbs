Gold traded near the lowest price in
more than two weeks on speculation central banks will refrain
from adding more stimulus to bolster global growth.  Bullion for immediate delivery was little changed at
$1,378.46 an ounce at 8:40 a.m. in  Singapore . Prices touched
$1,366.19 yesterday, the lowest since May 23. Gold for August
delivery was little changed at $1,377.80 an ounce on the Comex.  The  Bank of Japan  yesterday held back from expanding its
tools to rekindle inflation and stoke growth, sticking with an
April pledge to increase the monetary base by 60 trillion yen to
70 trillion yen a year. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said last month that the central bank could rein in its $85
billion monthly bond purchases if the U.S. employment outlook
showed a sustainable improvement.  “It’s the expectations of QE having a limited time
horizon,” said  David Lennox , an analyst at Fat Prophets in
Sydney, referring to quantitative easing. “The market is
fixated on the Fed.”  The U.S. central bank will reduce its purchases to $65
billion a month at its October meeting, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists last week. Gold is
down 18 percent this year as some investors lost faith in the
precious metal as a store of value, potentially ending a 12-year
bull run.  Silver for immediate delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$21.7355 an ounce after losing as much as 0.4 percent. Spot
platinum was little changed at $1,478.65 an ounce, while
palladium was also little changed at $752.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
