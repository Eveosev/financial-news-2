 U.K. stocks were little changed,
following two days of losses, as mergers-and-acquisition
activity increased.  Severn Trent Plc plunged the most in more than 3 1/2 years
as a consortium of partners abandoned a bid for the water
utility. Vodafone Group Plc fell to a two-month low after
confirming it approached Kabel Deutschland Holding AG about a
takeover. British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc gained 1.6 percent
after Banco Espirito Santo SA said it may get a new bid from
News Corp.  The FTSE 100 Index rose 3.37 points, less than 0.1 percent,
to 6,343.45 at 10:15 a.m. in  London . The equity benchmark has
lost 7.3 percent since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said May 22 that the central bank may scale back stimulus if the
U.S. economy improves sustainably. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index added less than 0.1 percent today, while Irelandâ€™s ISEQ
Index gained 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
