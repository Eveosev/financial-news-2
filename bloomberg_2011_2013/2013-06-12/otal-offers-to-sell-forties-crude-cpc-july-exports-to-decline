Total SA (FP)  failed to sell North Sea
Forties crude at a higher price than its offer yesterday. Vitol
Group sought to sell Russian Urals blend in the Mediterranean at
a smaller discount than the last transaction without success.  The Caspian Pipeline Consortium will reduce daily crude
exports from the Black Sea in July by 1.2 percent from June, a
provisional loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Total offered Forties for June 23 to June 25 loading at 35
cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, 10 cents higher than its
offer yesterday, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.  BP Plc (BP/)  didn’t manage to sell Forties for June 27 to June 29
at 20 cents less than Dated Brent, while  Eni SpA (ENI)  was unable to
sell the grade for July 4 to July 6 at a premium of 20 cents,
the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for Ekofisk and Oseberg.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was at 46 cents less than Dated Brent, compared
with a discount of 28 cents yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for July settlement traded at $103.86 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $102.28 in the previous session. The August contract was at
$103.94 at the same time today, a premium of 8 cents to July.  Forties cargo F0618 was deferred by one day to export on
June 25 to June 27, said two people with knowledge of the
loading program.  Shipments of Foinaven crude will remain at one cargo of
600,000 barrels in July, unchanged from June, according to a
loading program.  Planned oil field maintenance will reduce  North Sea  crude
supply by an average of 330,000 barrels a day from May to
September, potentially influencing  oil prices , according to the
 International Energy Agency .  “Seasonal maintenance, compounded with unplanned
maintenance in the same systems, can reduce the physical supply
of the BFOE price benchmark, causing upward price pressures,”
the Paris-based energy adviser said today in its monthly oil
market report.  South Korean refiners are set to cut imports of North Sea
crude after a tax change that will reduce the benefit they get
from buying oil from the region, according to the report.  Korean refiners receive 90 percent government reimbursement
for the difference in freight charges on crude imports from the
Americas, Africa and Europe compared with the  Middle East  in a
bid to diversify nation’s supply sources. As of July 1, refiners
buying duty-free crude from the EU will no longer be able to
claim this freight rebate, it said.  “The economic benefits that fueled brisk North Sea-Korea
trade over the past few years will be reduced,” the IEA said.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol failed to sell 80,000 metric tons of Urals for June
22 to June 26 at 10 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Augusta in  Italy , the survey showed. That
compares with a cargo it sold yesterday at minus 30 cents.  Eni didn’t manage to buy the same amount of Urals in this
region for June 26 to June 30 at 35 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, according to the survey.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 31 cents to a discount
of 35 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was 33 cents to the
benchmark, versus minus 50 cents in the previous session.  CPC will ship 2.757 million tons in July, compared with
2.699 million tons in June, the schedule showed. That’s equal to
691,029 barrels a day, down from 699,041 barrels this month.  The program comprises seven cargoes of 134,000 to 135,500
tons each and 21 consignments of 85,000 to 93,500 tons.  An unassigned position for 80,000 tons of Urals for June 14
to June 15 loading from the  Black Sea  port of Novorossiysk was
filled by OAO Lukoil, said two traders who participate in the
market, asking not to be identified as the information is
confidential.  OAO Surgutneftegas didn’t manage to fill the 100,000-ton
slot at Primorsk on the  Baltic Sea  for June 20 to June 21, they
said.  Libya  will resume exports from Zueitina after it restarted
supplies of crude and natural gas to the facility, the official
Lana news agency reported today, citing an unidentified engineer
at the port. Strikes and technical issues have disrupted exports
from Zueitina since the start of this year.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose by 4 cents to a
premium of $2.26 a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed.  Gabon plans to export three cargoes of Rabi Blend and two
shipments of Rabi Light in July, unchanged from June, according
to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News . All
consignments are of 650,o00 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
