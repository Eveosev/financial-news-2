Rosan Roeslani, a former  Bumi Plc (BUMI) 
director, has denied claims by the Indonesian coal producer that
he wrongfully received salary and bonuses.  “Obviously these accusations are baseless, one-sided, and
appear to be motivated by the need to deal with the ongoing Bumi
shareholder dispute,” Roeslani said in an e-mailed statement.
“I deplore the accuracy of those information contained in Bumi
Plc’s annual report, and I too deplore the way in which the
information was delivered.”  Bumi said last month that Roeslani, also a former president
director of its PT Berau Coal Energy unit, received
“substantially more” in salary, bonuses and other benefits
than had previously been disclosed. He was paid $3.8 million in
2011, according to Bumi’s annual report, published May 31. In
last year’s annual report Roeslani was said to have received
$700,638 in salary and bonus for 2011.  “Any remuneration I received was based on a contractual
arrangement that was professionally agreed between myself and
the company,” Roeslani said.  A spokesman for Bumi declined to comment.  Bumi has been at the center of a battle for control between
co-founders  Nathaniel Rothschild , scion of a centuries-old
British banking dynasty, and  Indonesia ’s Bakrie family since the
$3 billion deal that brought them together started to sour in
late 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
