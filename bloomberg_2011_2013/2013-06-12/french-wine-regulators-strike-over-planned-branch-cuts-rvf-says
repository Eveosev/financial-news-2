Employees of  France ’s Institut
National de l’Origine et de la Qualite, or INAO, who oversee
food and agriculture quality including wine classifications,
held a strike yesterday to protest against planned closures of
branch offices, La Revue du Vin de France said.  The number of regional offices will be cut to 16 from 25
under proposed spending restrictions, with employees being
offered the possibility to move office or take alternative work
in the civil service, according to RVF’s website. One office
affected is in the Loire wine district of Sancerre, RVF said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
