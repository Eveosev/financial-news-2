Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) , the biggest
publicly-traded commodity supplier, will raise a $17.3 billion
loan after receiving more than $19 billion in commitments from
banks, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.  A group of 80 lenders will provide the debt, including 29
committing $500 million each, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the terms are private. The deal may
complete this week.  The Baar, Switzerland-based company is replacing loans
including $12.8 billion of  credit lines  obtained before it
acquired Xstrata. Glencore concluded the all-share $29 billion
deal with the miner last month to add coal, copper, zinc and
nickel mines to its trading operations.  The revolving credit facilities, where money repaid can be
borrowed again, comprise one-, three- and five-year portions
that pay initial interest margins from 80 basis points, or 0.8
percentage points, to 90 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A spokesman for Glencore declined to comment on the
financing.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is coordinating the loan,
with Banco Santander SA, Barclays Plc, Commerzbank AG and
Societe Generale SA also helping to arrange the debt, the data
show.  Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent company
of  Bloomberg News , has been appointed non-executive director of
Glencore Xstrata, according to a statement from the company
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
