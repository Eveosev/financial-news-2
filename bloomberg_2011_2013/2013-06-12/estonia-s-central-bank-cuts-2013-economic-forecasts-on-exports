Estonia’s central bank cut its
economic-growth and  inflation (ESCPLYOY)  forecasts for 2013, citing weaker-than-expected export demand from Nordic countries and  Russia  and
falling oil prices.  Gross domestic product  will expand 2 percent, less than
December’s 3 percent projection, accelerating to 4.2 percent
next year, the bank, based in the capital, Tallinn, said today
in an e-mailed statement. Inflation will average 3 percent,
compared with the previous 3.6 percent forecast, slowing to 2.5
percent in 2014, the bank predicted.  “The recovery of external demand remains uncertain, which
may threaten the export sector,” the bank said. “Structural
unemployment and labor shortage could cause excessive wage
pressure, spur inflation and thereby harm export
competitiveness.”  Estonia has grown at the fastest pace in the euro area for
the last two years, expanding 8.3 percent and 3.2 percent. The
$22 billion Baltic economy is suffering from the delayed impact
of  Europe ’s debt crisis as demand for its electronics and metals
in Sweden and Finland weakens, according to the central bank.  Fitch Ratings  on May 30 affirmed Estonia’s credit grade at
A+, the fifth-highest investment grade, citing an economic
recovery and fiscal improvement since euro adoption in 2011.
Estonia was one of only three euro-area members last year
meeting European Union limits on public finances, together with
Finland and Luxembourg, Eurostat data show.  The government will meet its goal of balancing next year’s
budget after a deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2013, the
central bank said. The  unemployment rate  will fall to 9.2
percent this year from 10.2 percent in 2012, the bank predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
