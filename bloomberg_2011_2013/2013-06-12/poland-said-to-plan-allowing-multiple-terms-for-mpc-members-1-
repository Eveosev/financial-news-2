Poland’s government is working on
revising the central bank’s charter to allow members of the
rate-setting Monetary Policy Council to serve more than a single
six-year term, according to two people familiar with the plans.  The plans don’t envisage changing the number of MPC members
or the length of their terms, said the people, who asked not to
be named because the information isn’t public.  The central bank’s press office declined to comment when
contacted by phone today. Wieslawa Drozdz, a spokeswoman for the
 Finance Ministry , didn’t have an immediate comment when
contacted by  Bloomberg News  by phone and didn’t reply to an e-mail seeking comment.  “It seems quite a reasonable change,” Jaroslaw Janecki,
chief economist at  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  in Warsaw, said by phone.
“Another term would simply allow using the knowledge and
experience of some of the council members for longer, with clear
benefits to monetary policy.”  The Monetary Policy Council, which sets official borrowing
costs, has 10 members, with three selected by the lower house of
parliament, three by the upper house, three named by the
president and the central bank governor serving as chairman and
casting the deciding vote.  The council’s current term expires in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
