The Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
which operates the only oil export link in  Russia  with foreign
shareholders, will reduce daily crude exports from the Black Sea
in July by 1.2 percent from June, a provisional loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 2.757 million metric
tons, compared with 2.699 million tons in June, according to the
schedule. That’s equal to 691,029 barrels a day, down from
699,041 barrels this month.  The program comprises seven cargoes of 134,000 to
135,500 tons each and 21 consignments of 85,000 to 93,500 tons.  The CPC pipeline, in which Chevron Corp. is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from Kazakhstan’s western fields to a terminal near Russia’s
Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. Russia owns 31 percent and
Kazakhstan 20.75 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO Lukoil and a
joint venture between OAO Rosneft and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are
among the other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
