The  New Zealand dollar  fell against
its 16 major peers after the  Reserve Bank  left benchmark rates
unchanged at a record low and said the currency remains
overvalued.  The kiwi fell as Governor Graeme Wheeler reiterated that he
is prepared to intervene in  currency markets  to cap gains. The
bank lowered economic growth estimates and maintained its
forecast for the three-month bank bill yield, suggesting no
increase to the benchmark until mid-2014. Declines were tempered
as policy makers repeated concern about rising house prices.  “This was not quite as hawkish as the market had expected
and that’s why the kiwi is selling off a little bit,” said  Imre Speizer , a markets strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in
Auckland. “The market had already priced in a hawkish outcome
over the last few days.”  The kiwi dollar slid 0.5 percent to 79.52 U.S. cents as of
7:37 a.m. in Sydney, paring yesterday’s 1.5 percent surge. It
declined 0.5 percent to 76.35 yen.  Australia ’s dollar was down
0.1 percent to 94.71 U.S. cents.  New Zealand ’s central bank today maintained its forecast
the three-month bank bill yield will rise to 2.8 percent in the
second quarter next year from an estimated 2.7 percent in the
current quarter.  “The New Zealand dollar remains overvalued and continues
to be a headwind for the tradables sector,” Wheeler said in a
statement today after leaving the Official Cash Rate at 2.5
percent. “We expect to keep the OCR unchanged through the end
of the year.”  The RBNZ cut its forecast for gross domestic product growth
in the year through March 2014 to 3 percent from 3.3 percent,
and left its projection for the following year at 2.8 percent.
It raised its inflation forecast for 2014 to 1.9 percent from
1.7 percent. Inflation isn’t projected to reach 2 percent, the
midpoint of the RBNZ’s target range, until the second quarter of
2015.  The bank raised its projection for the 90-day bank bill
yield from the first quarter of 2015, predicting it will climb
to 4 percent by the end of that year compared with its previous
forecast of 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
