Brazil â€™s national cities council, an
advisory group created by the government, approved a 508.5
billion-real ($237 billion) sanitation plan aimed at boosting
water-supply and sewage-treatment infrastructure investments.  The goal is to provide potable water supplies to all urban
areas of Brazil over the next 10 years, the Ministry of Cities
said on its  website . Another target is to supply sewage services
to 93 percent of the urban areas within 20 years.  About 10 billion to 12 billion reais is expected to be
invested a year through 2030, the ministry said June 7 on its
website. About 298 billion reais will be furnished by federal
agencies.  The national council includes representatives from academic
institutions, religious groups and businesses, a spokeswoman for
the Ministry of Cities who declined to be named because of
organization policy said today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
