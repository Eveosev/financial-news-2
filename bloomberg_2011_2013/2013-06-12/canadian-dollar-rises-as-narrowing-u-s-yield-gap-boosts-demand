The Canadian dollar rose to its
strongest in almost four weeks against its U.S. peer as the
highest government-bond yields in more than a year bolstered
demand from investors seeking greater returns.  Canada’s currency gained for a fifth day, the longest
streak since April, as Canadian and U.S. government 10-year
securities each yielded about 2.19 percent. Benchmark U.S. notes
had yielded about nine basis points  more  at the end of May.  “If you have a higher-yielding currency, then you’ll have
investors moving in -- so that places a bid into the Canadian
currency,” Mazen Issa, Canada macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities, said by phone. “At the same
time, the  U.S. dollar  has been hit over the past couple of
weeks.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is nicknamed, rose 0.3
percent to C$1.0157 per U.S. dollar at 8:28 a.m. in Toronto
after touching C$1.0160, its highest since May 16. One loonie
buys 98.44 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
