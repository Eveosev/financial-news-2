Germany  had its second-wettest May
in at least 132 years, with rainfall that exceeded norms by 79
percent and an unusually overcast sky, weather office Deutscher
Wetterdienst reported.  Rainfall averaged 128 millimeters (5 inches) across the
country for the month, 57 millimeters more than than usual, the
office wrote in an online  report . 2007 was the only year for
records going back to 1881 when May was wetter, it wrote.  Farmers face flood damage of 405 million euros ($538
million), agriculture organization Deutscher Bauernverband said
yesterday, after downpours at the end of May continued into this
month. The country’s wheat harvest, the European Union’s second-biggest, fell 7.1 percent in 2007, according to figures from the
bloc’s statistics office.  “May 2013 was extremely wet, very poor in sunshine and
slightly colder than the climatological mean of the period 1981-2010,” Deutscher Wetterdienst wrote.  Sunshine in May amounted to 135.8 hours, 34 percent below
normal values and the fourth-smallest amount since 1951, the
weather office wrote. Only 2010, 1984 and 1983 had less sun,
according to the report.  The average temperature of 11.8 degrees Celsius (53.2
degrees Fahrenheit) last month was 1.2 degrees below the mean
for the 30 years through 2010, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
