Dwight 'Doc' Gooden, former Major 
League baseball pitcher, says writing "Doc: A Memoir", which 
chronicles his additions and recovery from drugs and alcohol, 
was painful. He also offers his thoughts on the steroids in 
baseball and the current season. Gooden speaks to Bloomberg's 
Vonnie Quinn and Eben Novy-Williams on  Bloomberg Radio 's "The 
Hays Advantage."  (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 06:55
