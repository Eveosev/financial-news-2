European Union nations may clinch a
deal by the end of this month to overhaul the bloc’s financial
markets rules, said a spokeswoman for Ireland, which holds the
rotating presidency of the bloc.  Governments reacted positively to the country’s latest
batch of compromise proposals on the revamp of the EU’s Markets
in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid, the spokeswoman,
who can’t be named in line with official policy, said by e-mail
following diplomat-level talks in Brussels today.  Ireland, whose EU presidency runs out on June 30, has
urged countries to accept “difficult compromises” to reach an
accord on the measures, which have triggered clashes between
 Germany (GDBR10)  and the U.K. over provisions to boost competition in the
clearing of derivatives trades. Further discussions between
national diplomats on the law are scheduled to take place
tomorrow.  Ireland is hopeful of securing a deal on the law -- which
also introduces measures to curb speculation with commodity
derivatives and toughen oversight of high-frequency trading --
before its presidency ends, the spokeswoman said.  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services chief, proposed
overhauling Mifid in 2011 to counter “speculative trading
activities” and implement agreements reached by the Group of 20
nations.  The draft law must be adopted by governments and by the
European Parliament before it can take effect. Legislators in
the assembly agreed on their negotiating position last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
