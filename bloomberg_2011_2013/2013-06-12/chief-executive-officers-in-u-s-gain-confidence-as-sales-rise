Chief executive officers in the U.S.
project a pickup in sales and hiring in the next six months as
the economy improves, a survey showed.  The  Business Roundtable ’s  economic outlook  index rose to a
one-year high of 84.3 in the second quarter from 81 in the
previous three months, the Washington-based trade group reported
today. Readings greater than 50 are consistent with economic
expansion. Today’s measure is above the long-term average of
79.3.  Seventy-eight percent of business leaders estimated sales
will rise in the next six months, up from 72 percent in the
previous quarter. More respondents, 32 percent this quarter
compared with 29 percent, also forecast an increase in payrolls.  Capital spending plans over the next six months were little
changed, with 37 percent indicating they expect more investment
in equipment compared with 38 percent in the previous quarter.
At the same time, the share of executives anticipating a
decrease in  capital expenditures  fell, to 11 percent from 15
percent.  The survey, taken during the last two weeks of May,
tabulates the responses of 141 chief executive officers who
belong to the Business Roundtable. The group’s members represent
companies with a combined workforce of almost 16 million
employees and more than $7.3 trillion in annual revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
