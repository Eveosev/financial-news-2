Ciech SA posted the biggest drop
this month after PKO Bank Polski SA downgraded Poland’s largest
maker of soda for glass production to sell from hold.  The  shares  fell as much as 2.3 percent and traded 1.5
percent lower to 26.59 zloty, the steepest decline on closing
basis since May 31, as of 1:34 p.m. in Warsaw. Ciech’s price-estimate was set at 23.06 zloty by PKO. The number of shares
traded was 263 percent of the stock’s three-month daily average
volume, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The business environment remains unfavorable,” Monika Kalwasinska, a Warsaw-based analyst at PKO, said in a report
today. “The economic slowdown and weaker demand triggered
overcapacity in  Europe , resulting in pressure on the soda
market.”  Sales at state-controlled Ciech will fall 17 percent from a
year ago to 3.62 billion zloty ($1.1 billion) in 2013, PKO said.
 Poland  is battling a slowdown as the recession in the 17-nation
euro area, which buys 52 percent of Polish exports, crimps
growth. The European Commission last month cut Poland’s 2013
growth forecast to 1.1 percent from 1.2 percent.  The stock has gained 19 percent  this year , outperforming
the WIG20 Index, which fell 3.6 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
