Bakken crude in  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s
pipeline system strengthened to its highest premium over prices
at the well in nearly six months as planned maintenance reduced
the amount of light crude available to Midwest refineries.  The 350,000-barrel-a-day Syncrude upgrader in  Alberta  began
work on a coker earlier this week that had been scheduled for
the second half of the year,  Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the
project’s largest owner, said in a June 10 statement.  Syncrude is a light crude from oil-sands bitumen processed
in an upgrader. It competes for space in Midwest refineries with
Bakken oil that is piped through Enbridge’s North Dakota system
and put on Enbridge’s mainline in Clearbrook,  Minnesota .  Bakken oil priced in Clearbrook was unchanged at a  premium 
of $15.69 a barrel more than the Plains Marketing LP posted
price for Williston Basin Sweet Crude at 4:12 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest level since Dec.
20.  The spread between the two prices had narrowed in recent
months as producers loaded oil directly onto trains headed to
refineries on the East, West and Gulf coasts, where waterborne
crude is more expensive. About 71 percent of Bakken oil was
transported by rail in March, compared to 20 percent by pipe,
according to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority.  Bakken at Clearbrook was unchanged  compared  to West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at a $3.50-a-barrel premium.
Syncrude weakened 50 cents to an $11-a-barrel premium over the
U.S. benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
