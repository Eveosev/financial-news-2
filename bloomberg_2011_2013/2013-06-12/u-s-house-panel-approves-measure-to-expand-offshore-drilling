A U.S. House of Representatives
committee voted 23 to 18 to approve a measure that would expand
oil drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans.  The measure from the Republican-controlled Natural
Resources Committee would call for a boost in production off of
 California  using existing platforms, and leases for drilling off
of Virginia and  South Carolina . The bill would also establish in
legislation the changes to the Department of Interiorâ€™s leasing
and oversight of oil drilling that were made following the 2010
Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
