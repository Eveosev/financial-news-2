A rise in rebels attacks on oil
pipelines hasn’t hurt production in a significant way, the
Colombian Minister for Energy and Mines Federico Renjifo said in
an interview.  The use of drones and a dedicated battalion of soldiers is
part of the government’s strategy to protect the oil
infrastructure, Renjifo said on the sidelines of the Conference
of Montreal.  “Yes there are more attacks than last year but production
hasn’t been affected as much - repercussions have been
smaller,” Renjifo said. “We have an entire battalion of 4,000
or 5,000 men that’s deployed to the protection of hydrocarbons
production. We also have drones and other means at our
disposal.”  The country’s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or Farc, ended a unilateral cease-fire in
January, stepping up attacks on oil pipelines in a bid to
strengthen its hand during peace talks with the Colombian
government, currently under way in  Havana .  Renjifo said the new Bicentenario pipeline will be
completed in July or August and that a study is being conducted
for an additional pipeline leading to the Pacific Coast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
