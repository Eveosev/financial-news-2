Brent crude  may fall to $90 a barrel
in coming months on signs that the  global economy  is weakening,
prompting some Middle East nations to cut production, according
to Noah Capital Markets EMEA Ltd.  Saudi Arabia , Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar
would consider “rapidly” reducing output by as much as 1
million barrels a day to 1.5 million should Brent, the benchmark
for more than half the world’s oil, fall to $90 a barrel, Emad Mostaque, a strategist at the London-based investment bank, said
in an interview today in Dubai. The four Gulf Cooperation
Council members wouldn’t wait for OPEC agreement, he said.  “I see big headwinds in most places as economic data
continues to disappoint,” Mostaque said. “GCC producers have
various budget breakevens but $90 is an important psychological
level.”  Brent has lost almost 8 percent this year, trading today at
$102 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange,
as economic stagnation in Europe, slowing expansion in  China  and
threats to recovery in the U.S. constrain fuel consumption. OPEC
pledged at its May 31 meeting to curb excess production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
