The  European Investment Bank  is
considering loans to countries affected by heavy flooding that
could be on the scale of the 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion)
provided in 2002 under similar conditions, the Luxembourg-based
EIB said today.  Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic
have been offered financial support for dealing with damage to
crops and infrastructure caused by the flooding, the EIB said.
Emergency lending programs can cover up to 100 percent of needed
project financing, using simplified procedures and with terms of
as long as 30 years, the EIB said.  “The EIB is willing to go beyond the amount from 2002,
depending on investment demands and if needed,” EIB president
Werner Hoyer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
