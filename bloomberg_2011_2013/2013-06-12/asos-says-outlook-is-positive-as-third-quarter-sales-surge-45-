Asos Plc (ASC) , an online-only U.K.
fashion retailer, said the outlook for the financial year
through August is positive after third-quarter sales accelerated
on faster growth in the U.K., where it has cut prices.  Total retail sales rose 45 percent to 193.6 million pounds
($303 million) in the three months ended May 31, the London-based retailer said in a statement today. That’s ahead of the
prior quarter’s 37 percent growth and compares with the median
estimate of 43 percent from 10 analysts compiled by  Bloomberg
News . U.K. retail sales rose 39 percent to 64.3 million pounds.  The  retailer  of own-label and branded fashions to 241
markets globally expects full-year results to be in line with
market expectations. Earlier this month it landed Associated
British Foods Plc’s budget fashion chain Primark, which said it
would sell a “small selection” of its most fashion-led pieces
on Asos, cementing the website’s place as a fashion destination
for a target audience of men and women in their twenties.  “We remain positive in our outlook for the year to Aug.
31, 2013 and expect our full-year results to be in line with
expectations,” Chief Executive Officer Nick Robertson said in
the statement.  The shares fell 3.2 percent to 3,981 pence in  London 
trading yesterday. The stock has gained 48 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
