Forget the tie or cuff links â€” this year, let's spoil Dad with the ultimate Father's Day in some over-the-top Dad dens. From a video arcade to a basketball court, here are some rooms that were made for Pops. Get the High Score Dad can impress the guys at the video arcade if he has time to practice on some old-school machines. Drive, shoot and get the high score on four arcade game systems in this Arizona home. And after Dad has gotten some arcade time in, he can check out the rest of the luxe house, which also boasts an 1800s-style saloon, wine cellar and private elevator. Bowl a Frame It's not just a bowling lane in this home, but an entire alley with a snack bar and enough seating for Dad to host the entire bowling team. And if Dad doesn't love bowling, the Dallas home also has a putting green and an enormous garage designed for vintage cars. Cabin Cuisine Does Dad consider himself the "Top Chef" in his kitchen? This cabin-style kitchen has two flat screens, high-end appliances and plenty of counter space for him to show off his culinary skills. Modern Pool Shark This space is for the Dad who prefers modern over rustic. The New York townhouse was flawlessly designed by HGTV stars Bob and Cortney Novogratz and features a basement wine cellar and a fourth-floor zinc-and-mahogany bar imported from Paris. The pool table is a vintage find, according to the listing. Home for Hoops Dad can shoot hoops with the guys in the cul-de-sac or local gym, but it's so much better when the basketball court is in-house! After some time on the court, the space can be converted to a home theater.
