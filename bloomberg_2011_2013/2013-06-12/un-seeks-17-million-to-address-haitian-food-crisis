About 1.5 million Haitians face
severe hunger following extreme weather conditions and depleted
harvests in the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country, the United
Nations’ World Food Programme said.  The WFP said it is “extremely concerned” about food
shortages after  Haiti ’s harvests were diminished by drought and
 Hurricane Sandy , which killed 54 people and destroyed more than
90,000 hectares (222,000 acres) of crops in October last year.
An additional 6.7 million Haitians struggle to meet their own
food needs on a regular basis, the Geneva-based organization
said in a  statement .  The organization plans to assist 1.1 million Haitians in
2013 and needs an additional $17.2 million to provide sufficient
food resources, said Elisabeth Byrs, a WFP spokeswoman.  Severe food insecurity is above 50 percent in 44 national
communes in Haiti, according to the the National Coordination
for Food Security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
