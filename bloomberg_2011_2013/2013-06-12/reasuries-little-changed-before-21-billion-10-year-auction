Treasuries were little changed,
holding yesterday’s biggest gain in almost a week, before the
U.S. sells $21 billion of 10-year notes today and $13 billion of
30-year bonds tomorrow.  U.S. government securities advanced yesterday after an
increase in yields lured investors. Ten-year yields were as high
as 2.29 percent, a level not seen since April 2012. A three-year
sale yesterday drew the weakest bidding in 2 1/2 years.  “There’s some value in 10s and 30s compared to the
inflation rate,” said Kazuaki Oh’e, a debt salesman in  Tokyo  at
CIBC World Markets  Japan  Inc., a unit of  Canada ’s fifth-largest
lender.  Benchmark 10-year notes  yielded  2.2 percent as of 10:18
a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The
price of the 1.75 percent security maturing in May 2023 was 96
1/32. Thirty-year yields increased one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.33 percent.  The U.S. personal consumption expenditure deflator, the
Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, rose 0.7 percent in April
from a year earlier, the smallest increase since 2009, based on
Commerce Department data.  Japan’s 10-year rate was unchanged at 0.88 percent. It has
declined from this year’s high of 1 percent set in May.  The U.S. sold $32 billion of three-year notes yesterday at
a yield of 0.581 percent. A Bloomberg News survey of traders
before the auction projected 0.575 percent.  The amount of bids at the offering relative to debt sold, a
gauge of demand known as the  bid-to-cover  ratio, was 2.95, the
weakest since December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
