Lionel Messi , Barcelona’s four-time
world soccer player of the year, denied allegations of  tax
evasion  filed by prosecutors in Spain,  El Pais  reported.  Prosecutors in Catalonia filed a complaint today alleging
that Messi and his father Jorge failed to declare income from
sponsorship deals dating back to 2005, evading 4 million euros
($5.3 million) of taxes, El Pais said.  “We have never committed any offense whatsoever,” the
newspaper cited Messi as saying on its website. “We have always
met all our tax obligations following the guidance of our
advisers, who will take charge of clearing up this situation.”  Messi last season helped Barcelona to its fourth Spanish
league title in five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
