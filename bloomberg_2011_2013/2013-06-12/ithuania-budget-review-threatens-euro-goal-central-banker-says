A proposed revision of  Lithuania ’s
2013 budget may threaten the country’s goal of adopting the euro
in two years, central bank Governor Vitas Vasiliauskas said.  Parliament asked the government last month to allocate more
money to local governments, whose costs have risen since the
minimum wage increased in January. Lawmakers are able to suggest
other budgetary changes during discussion of the proposal.  “To qualify for adopting the euro in 2015, the main accent
must be keeping public finances under control,” Vasiliauskas
told reporters today in the capital, Vilnius. “Let’s be
realistic -- I don’t see that we have any room for maneuver.”  Lithuania would probably be the last Baltic country to
adopt the euro after Estonia made the switch in 2011 and with
Latvia set to follow suit next year. To qualify, the government
plans to bring the  budget deficit  within the European Union
ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product, narrowing the
2013 gap to 2.5 percent from 3.2 percent last year.  Assuming this year’s fiscal goal is met, “the 2014 budget
will be what ultimately determines Lithuania’s chances to adopt
the euro” during a “window” of low inflation that’s expected
to stay open until 2015, according to the central bank chief.
Meeting the EU inflation limit “shouldn’t be much of a
problem,” Vasiliauskas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
