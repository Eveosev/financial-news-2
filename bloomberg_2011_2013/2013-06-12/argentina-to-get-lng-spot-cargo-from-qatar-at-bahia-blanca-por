Argentina , which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to
receive a spot cargo of the fuel from Qatar, according to ship-tracking data.  The Celestine River, with a capacity of about 145,000 cubic
meters, is on its way to the port of  Bahia Blanca  southwest of
 Buenos Aires , according to ship transmissions captured by IHS
Fairplay on Bloomberg. It was scheduled to arrive on June 8.  The tanker loaded its cargo at Qatar’s Ras Laffan LNG
terminal and departed on May 14, according to the data.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s biggest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. YPF closed a tender on May 6 to buy seven LNG cargoes
for delivery to Bahia Blanca. Enarsa and YPF have issued seven
spot tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
