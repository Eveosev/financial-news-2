Lexington Partners Inc., one of the
largest firms dedicated to buying private-equity interests, is
set to complete fundraising for two pools this year before
seeking investors for its next flagship vehicle in 2014,
according to two people with knowledge of the plans.  Lexington is to finish fundraising on its third co-investment fund, Lexington Co-Investment Partners III LP, of
about $1.5 billion by the end of June, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the talks are private.
Secondaries funds such as those run by Lexington buy investorsâ€™
commitments in private-equity funds rather than purchasing
companies directly.  Previously, Lexington co-investment funds were backed
largely by just two institutions, the Florida State Board of
Administration and the  New York  State Teachers Retirement
System. The new fund, which invests directly in companies owned
by private-equity managers, will feature a wider investor base,
one person said.  Separately, New York-based Lexington held a first close,
the point at which a fund can begin to invest, for its third
mid-market fund, Lexington Middle Market Investors III LP, in
April and is expected to hold a final close at its $750 million
target by the end of 2013, the people said.  With marketing for these funds completed, Lexington is
expected to begin raising a successor to its main vehicle,
Lexington Capital Partners VIII LP, in early 2014, the people
said. The fund is expected to have a similar target to its
predecessor, which closed at $7 billion in 2011, one person
said.  A spokesman for Lexington declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
