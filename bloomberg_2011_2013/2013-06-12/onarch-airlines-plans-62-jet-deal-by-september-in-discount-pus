Monarch Airlines Ltd. plans to order
as many as 62 single-aisle jetliners by the end of September as
the U.K. charter carrier seeks to transform itself into a
discount operator along the lines of  EasyJet Plc. (EZJ)   Monarch is considering both existing and upgraded versions
of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. short-haul models, plus the new
CSeries jet from Bombardier Inc., as it mulls fleet renewal and
expansion requirements, Finance Director  Robert Palmer  said.  “We’ve got a lot of options and we’re going to narrow
those down over the next couple months before getting to the
final bid stage,” Palmer said in an interview. “We have a
unique, once-in-a-generation opportunity to make a real decision
against whatever is in the marketplace without preference.”  Monarch currently operates a short-haul fleet consisting
mainly of Airbus A320 and A321 planes and is looking at the same
variants for the pending order, potentially in the re-engined
Neo version, Palmer said. It’s also evaluating the corresponding
Boeing 737-800 and -900, including the upgraded Max model.  Bombardier (BBD/B) ’s CSeries offers “amazing” seat costs and could
be attractive in a 150-to-160-passenger layout, in which case
Monarch would probably opt for a mixed order from the Canadian
company and either Airbus or Boeing, Palmer said. The aircraft
would be delivered through 2024, according to a statement.  Luton, England-based Monarch has taken delivery of two
A320s this year to fulfill short-term needs and will boost its
fleet to 39 planes by the end of 2013. Eight aircraft are due to
be retired over the next two years, including Boeing 757s.  A handful of Airbus A330 planes will continue to meet the
company’s limited wide-body requirements for the foreseeable
future, Palmer said.  Monarch boosted its passenger total 5.4 percent to 6.28
million in the year through October 2012. Cost cuts helped the
company narrow its adjusted loss before tax to 14.9 million
pounds ($23 million) from 51.1 million pounds as it targets a
profit this fiscal year, according to the statement.  Revenue rose 10 percent in the six months ended April 30,
with yields -- a measure of average prices -- gaining 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
