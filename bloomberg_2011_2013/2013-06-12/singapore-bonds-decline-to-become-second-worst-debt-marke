Singapore  bonds fell for a fourth
day, making their loss for the past three months the second-biggest in the world, as investors gird for the possibility that
the U.S. Federal Reserve could slow bond purchases.  The price of Singapore’s 3.125 percent note due in
September 2022 tumbled to S$107.30 as of 3:27 p.m. local time
from S$108.24 yesterday, based on data compiled by Bloomberg and
the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The yield rose 10 basis
points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 2.24 percent, a level not
seen since July 2011.  “The only reason for this is the speculation of Fed
tapering,” said Michael Wan, an economist at Credit Suisse
Group AG in Singapore. “There’s pretty much a sell-off across
all countries and markets.”  The  Bloomberg Singapore Sovereign Bond Index (BSIN)  has declined
2.4 percent over three months. The only other sovereign index
among 33 tracked by Bloomberg that fell more was Slovenia’s with
a 4.3 percent decline. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index
fell 0.2 percent.  The Fed buys $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed
securities each month to support the economy by putting downward
pressure on borrowing costs. It will probably reduce its
purchases to $65 billion a month at its Oct. 29-30 meeting,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 59
economists last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
