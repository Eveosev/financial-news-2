Arizona  Governor Jan Brewer asked a
federal appeals court to uphold a state law barring health care
providers who perform abortions from receiving Medicaid funds.  State lawyers are seeking to reverse a U.S. judge’s ruling
that the law violates federal Medicaid’s guarantee that patients
can choose their own doctor by excluding otherwise qualified
physicians from participation in the state’s Medicaid program.  The Arizona law prohibits Medicaid funding for health-care
providers who perform abortions except when the pregnancy is the
result of rape or incest or threatens the health or life of the
mother. The measure, which had been scheduled to take effect in
August, was challenged by Planned Parenthood Arizona.  U.S. District Judge Neil Wake in Phoenix issued an order in
February permanently blocking the law from taking effect.  The case is Planned Parenthood Arizona Inc. v. Betlach,
12-17558,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Ninth Circuit ( San
Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
