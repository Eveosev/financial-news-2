The European Commission sought to
distance itself from Greece’s decision to shut down its public
broadcaster, saying the government in  Athens  acted in “full
autonomy.”  “The commission has taken note of the decision by the
Greek authorities,” European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told the European Parliament
today in Strasbourg,  France . “This has not been a commission
decision.”  The government of Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
decided yesterday to suspend the 2,600 jobs at public
broadcaster ERT and create a new, smaller company. The signal
for the three public television channels was switched off by the
Greek finance ministry shortly before midnight.  The step drew criticism from Samaras’s coalition partners,
heightening tensions in a year-old government that is seeking to
pursue budget cuts to remain eligible for emergency
international aid. As part of the conditions for the aid,  Greece 
is required to reduce the number of workers on the state payroll
by 15,000 by the end of 2014.  The commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, helps oversee the
rescue program for Greece along with the International Monetary
Fund and the European Central Bank.  “The commission has not sought the closure of ERT, but nor
does the commission question the Greek government’s mandate to
manage the public sector in Greece,” Rehn said. “The decision
of the Greek authorities has been taken in the context of the
major efforts that the authorities are taking to modernize the
Greek economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
