Robusta coffee fell to the lowest
level in more than 17 months in London, with speculators
boosting bearish bets just as rainfall is set to ease in
 Indonesia ’s main growing area. Cocoa retreated.  Money managers more than  tripled bets  on falling prices of
robusta coffee traded in London in the week ended June 4,
according to NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext.
Southern Sumatra, Indonesia’s main coffee-growing region, will
get drier weather this week, favoring harvesting, MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. Rains had been delaying deliveries from farms.  “As the markets head into new multi-year lows, the specs
and funds just seem to have less excuse not to sell,” brokerage
ABN Amro Markets U.K. Ltd., said by e-mail today. “Roasters,
having priced and extended cover above, are now picking away at
attractive levels but clearly without the ability to support
prices. The pain is clearly to the downside with origin stops
having been elected today.”  Robusta coffee for July delivery retreated 1.4 percent to
$1,773 a metric ton by 11:06 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .
Earlier, the price fell to $1,738 a ton, the lowest since Jan.
9, 2012. Arabica coffee for July delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1.293 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Money managers boosted their net-short positions, or wagers
on a lower market, to 7,096 futures and options in the week
ended June 4, the Commitments of Traders report published on the
exchange’s website on June 10 showed. That compares with 2,029
contracts a week earlier and it’s the biggest net-short position
since Jan. 17, 2012, exchange data on Bloomberg showed.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August added 0.4
percent to $478.30 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in
July was 0.2 percent lower at 16.63 cents a pound in New York.  Cocoa for delivery in July was down 0.6 percent at 1,542
pounds ($2,416) a ton on NSYE Liffe. Cocoa for September
delivery rose was little changed at $2,366 a ton on ICE.  “Physical movement continues to be good as does the
weather, leaving the market vulnerable to setbacks,” Sterling Smith, a futures Specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said
in a report e-mailed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
