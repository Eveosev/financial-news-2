South Korean refiners are set to cut
imports of North Sea crude after a tax change that will reduce
the benefit they get from buying oil from the region, according
to the  International Energy Agency .  South Korea , the world’s fifth-largest buyer of crude
cargoes, signed a free trade agreement with the European Union
in July 2011 that granted the country an exemption from a 3
percent tax on crude imports. Refiners in the country also
receive a tax rebate on refined product exports, including those
made from crude imported from the EU.  A third incentive is a 90 percent government reimbursement
for the difference in freight charges on crude imports from the
Americas, Africa and  Europe  compared with the  Middle East  in a
bid to diversify nation’s supply sources. As of July 1, refiners
buying duty-free crude from the EU will no longer be able to
claim this freight rebate, the IEA said today in its monthly Oil
Market Report.  “The economic benefits that fueled brisk North Sea-Korea
trade over the past few years will be reduced,” the Paris-based
agency said.  There has been an unprecedented flow of North Sea crude to
the country in the last two years. The change in legislation
will see shipments to South Korea drop to 55,000 barrels a day
from 110,000 barrels in 2012, Vienna-based analysts JBC Energy
GmbH said in a report on June 10.  South Korea will import 2.6 million barrels a day of crude
by sea this year, according to data from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the
world’s largest shipbroker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
