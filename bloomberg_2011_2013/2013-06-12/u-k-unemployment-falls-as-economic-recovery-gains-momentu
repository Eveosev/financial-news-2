U.K. jobless claims  fell more than economists forecast in May and a wider measure of unemployment also declined, providing further evidence that an economic recovery is under way.   Jobless claims  fell 8,600 from April to 1.51 million, leaving the rate at a 2 1/2-year low of 4.5 percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in  London . Unemployment as measured by International Labour Organisation methods fell 5,000 in the three months through April to 2.51 million, a rate of  7.8 percent . Employment rose 24,000 to a record 29.8 million.  Recent data show  the economy  is gathering momentum after a return to growth in the first three months of the year, and Bank of England Markets Director  Paul Fisher  said today that the second quarter “looks very good.” Still, wages are under pressure and growth may not be strong enough to deliver further significant improvements to the labor market, economists said.  “After being in a pretty long funk for the past couple of years there is something of an acceleration going on” in the economy, said Neville Hill, an economist at Credit Suisse Group AG in London and a former U.K. Treasury official. “But it isn’t very strong, and certainly nothing like escape velocity.”  The pound advanced for a second day against the euro and was trading at 84.83 pence as of 11:30 a.m. in London after touching 84.70 pence, the strongest level since May 21. It rose 0.1 percent to $1.5662.  Government bonds  were little changed after falling for four consecutive days on speculation the Bank of England will refrain from further asset purchases. The 10-year yield was at 2.17 percent.  Delayed Bonuses  Pay growth accelerated to 1.3 percent in the three months through April from 0.6 percent. Some of the increase may be explained by delayed bonus payments as highly paid workers sought to take advantage of a cut in the top income-tax rate to 45 percent from 50 percent that took effect in April.  Basic pay growth was 0.9 percent versus 0.8 percent in the previous period, underlining the pressure on  living standards  at a time when inflation is running at 2.4 percent.  The outlook for jobs remains “firmly positive,” with construction set to emerge from the recession that has gripped the sector for the past five years, a Manpower survey this week showed.  The euro region is also showing signs of a pickup from its record-long recession. Data today showed euro-area industrial production unexpectedly increased in April. Factory production rose 0.4 percent from March, compared with a forecast for no change, according to the median of 36 economists’ predictions  In  Asia , however, statistics today showed machine orders in  Japan  fell 8.8 percent in April from March, and  South Korea ’s unemployment rate climbed to 3.2 percent in May. A measure of consumer sentiment in  Australia  climbed in June.  Fisher’s View  The slump in the euro area, Britain’s biggest export market, and government austerity at home continue to weigh on the U.K. economy. In addition, companies that curbed costs during the recession by cutting wages rather than firing workers may want to see productivity improve before adding staff.  Fisher of the  Bank of England , speaking at an event in London today, said that he’s “not happy with unemployment where it is and not happy about growth being as slow as it is.”  “Growth is going to be slow for a long time,” he said. “The second quarter as it happens looks very good but these things will slip from one quarter to another.”  The U.K.’s claimant count has fallen for seven straight months to its lowest level since May 2011. In April, it fell 11,800 instead of the 7,300 drop initially reported. Job vacancies in the economy rose 19,000 in the quarter through May to 516,000, the highest level since 2008, the ONS said.  Cameron Austerity  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s deficit-reduction program saw public-sector employment fall 22,000 in the first quarter to 5.7 million, the lowest since December 2001. Cuts in local government and publicly controlled companies accounted for all of the decrease. Central government employment rose 13,000. Private-sector employment increased 46,000 to 24.1 million.  There were increases in both full-time and part-time work in the three months through April, with the number of workers over the age of 65 rising above 1 million for the first time.  Unemployment among 16-24-year-olds declined 43,000 to 950,000, though the number of people out of work for at least a year climbed by 11,000 to 898,000, or 35.8 percent of the U.K. jobless total.
