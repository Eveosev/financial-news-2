Net Insight AB (NETIB) , a Swedish maker of
equipment for media and broadcast networks, rose the most in
almost two weeks in Stockholm trading after winning an order
from the European Broadcasting Union.  The company’s  shares jumped  as much as 6.8 percent to 1.25
kronor, its steepest advance since May 31. The stock traded 2.6
percent higher as of 10:09 a.m. local time, with trading volumes
at 102 percent of the daily average in the past three months,
giving Net Insight a market value of 465 million kronor ($71
million).  The order from the EBU for Net Insight’s Nimbra platform is
valued at more than 1 million euros ($1.33 million), with
delivery to take place in the second quarter, it said in a
statement today. The EBU is the world’s largest alliance of
public service media organizations and operates Eurovision,
which distributes and produces entertainment, sports and news
events and whose fiber network is based on Nimbra, it said.  “EBU is our customer since 2004 and have evolved its
Eurovision network continuously to meet increasing customer
requirements for more capacity and new services,” Net Insight
said in today’s statement. “EBU will perform several different
build-outs of its network to support large global events.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
