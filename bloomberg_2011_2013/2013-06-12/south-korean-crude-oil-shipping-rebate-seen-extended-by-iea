South Korea , the world’s fifth-largest buyer of crude cargoes, extended a law that provides
freight-cost rebates to companies importing non-Middle East oil,
according to the  International Energy Agency .  The Asian country will rebate 90 percent of the freight
cost to companies that purchase 2 million barrels or more of
non-Middle East oil in a year, the Paris-based adviser to South
Korea and 27 other energy-consuming nations said in a report
today. The rule previously applied when annual imports reached 7
million barrels, it said.  The law, designed to diversify where the country gets its
oil from, took effect on June 1 and “supported” the price of
North Sea crudes since then, the IEA said. South Korea will
import 2.6 million barrels a day of crude by sea this year,
according to data from Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest
shipbroker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
