Canada said it will require mining
and energy firms to report payments they make to governments.  The new system “will seek to enhance transparency and
accountability around material payments by extractive companies
to all levels of governments domestically and internationally,
including taxes, license fees and other receipts,” the office
of Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said today in a statement
issued in  London .  The move is “in keeping with” efforts by the U.K. to
promote transparemcy at the summit of Group of Eight leaders in
 Northern Ireland  next week, the government said in the
statement.  Canada will consult with industry, the country’s provinces
and other stakeholders “over the coming months” before
implementing the system, it said.  Harper is in London today on an eight-day trip during which
he will attend the G8 summit..  To contact the reporter on this story:
