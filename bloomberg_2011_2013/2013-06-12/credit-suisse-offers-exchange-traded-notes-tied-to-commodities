Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) ,
Switzerlandâ€™s second-largest bank, is offering two exchange-traded notes tied to commodities today for trading.  The Credit Suisse Commodity Rotation ETN is linked to a
commodities benchmark where prompt contracts cost more than
later deliveries, a phenomenon known as backwardation, according
to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The securities trade under the ticker CSCR and have
an annual fee of 0.85 percent.  The bank also started trading the Credit Suisse Commodity
Benchmark ETN, which is joined to an index of 34 commodities
with delivery periods as long as three months, according to a
 prospectus  filed with the SEC. The securities trade under the
ticker  CSCB (CSCB)  and have an annual fee of 0.65 percent.  Katherine Herring , a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse in  New
York , referred to a press release when asked for comment on the
securities.  Credit Suisse issues seven other ETNs under its own name
and 18 of the securities under the VelocityShares brand,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  largest  is the
 Credit Suisse Cushing 30 MLP Index ETN (MLPN) , with $506.8 million in
total assets, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
