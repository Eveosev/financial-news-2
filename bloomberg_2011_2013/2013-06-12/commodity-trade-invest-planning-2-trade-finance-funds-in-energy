Commodity Trade Invest LLC, a
Geneva-based company started by former BNP Paribas SA bankers,
plans two trade finance funds in oil products and steam coal.  Itâ€™s talking with a hedge fund to raise as much as $500
million that will provide short-term loans backed by commodities
to traders of refined oil and bioenergy products and
petrochemicals, Philippe Steiner, co-founder of CTI, said by e-mail on June 10. The assets targeted for the coal fund are as
much as $100 million and probable investors are high net-worth
individuals and family offices, he said.  Jacques Begle, former co-head of trade finance at BNP, and
Steiner started CTI this year to help bridge a gap in loans for
smaller commodity merchants after banks stepped up lending
rules. Steiner was previously a relationship manager for
commodity finance at BNP, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
