Corn futures tumbled the most in
five weeks, leading declines in wheat and soybeans, after the
U.S. said inventories will be bigger than analysts’ forecast as
global production rebounds from a drought last year.  Record domestic corn output of 14.005 billion bushels this
year will more than double inventories before the harvest in
2014, and soybean production will be 3.39 billion bushels, the
most ever, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
 report . While drought damage late last year will reduce the 2013
U.S. wheat harvest, global output will rise 6.1 percent.  Corn, soybean and wheat futures that surged as the drought
cut output in 2012 have tumbled into bear markets this year,
easing global food prices that are down 9.5 percent from a
record in February 2011. Even after wet, cool weather in April
and May delayed planting, the USDA said it expects a 30 percent
jump in 2013 corn production in the U.S., the world’s largest
grower and exporter, and a 12 percent increased for soybeans.  “The market is reacting to the larger supply forecast than
people expected,”  Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst for
AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,  Illinois , said in a telephone
interview. “This report signals there is no shortage
developing, and takes away much of the speculator incentive to
be bullish.”  Corn futures for delivery in December, after the harvest,
fell 2.4 percent to close at $5.375 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade, the biggest drop for a most-active
contract since May 6. Prices have tumbled 37 percent from a
record $8.49 in August.  Bigger Inventory  U.S. corn  inventories  before the 2014 harvest will total
1.949 billion bushels, up from 769 million this year, the lowest
since 1996, the USDA said. The average estimate of 30 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 1.829 billion. The government said
production in 2013 will be higher than the average estimate of
13.82 billion, based on a separate Bloomberg survey of 28
analysts. Farmers collected 10.78 billion in 2012.  World corn  inventories  on Oct. 1, 2014, will total 151.83
million metric tons, up from 124.31 million this year, the USDA
said. Analysts expected 151.21 million tons, the average of 16
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  U.S. wheat stockpiles on June 1, 2014, were forecast by the
USDA at 659 million bushels, more than the 655 million expected
by analysts and down from 670 million projected in May.
Production in  Kansas , the biggest U.S. producer, was pegged at
307.8 million bushels, up 2.7 percent from a May forecast, as
precipitation in May boosted prospects for late-blooming plants.  Wheat Falls  As much as three times the normal amount of precipitation
fell in central and eastern Kansas in May, National Weather
Service data show. The harvest in the state, which last year at
this time was 48 percent complete, hasn’t started in 2013 after
cold weather prevented plants from coming out of winter
dormancy.  “The rains we’ve had in the last two or three or four
weeks were more beneficial than we thought,”  Larry Glenn , an
analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter, Kansas, said by telephone.
“There were some areas that got some good moisture.”  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 2 percent to $6.83 a
bushel in Chicago, after touching $6.79, the lowest for a most-active contract since May 21. Prices have dropped 28 percent
since reaching a nearly four-high of $9.4725 on July 23.  Soybean Outlook  U.S. soybean inventories may also double before the 2014
harvest as production rebounds from three consecutive years of
drought, the government said.  Reserves on Aug. 31, 2014, will total 265 million bushels,
up from this year’s projection of 125 million, the USDA said
today in a  report . The average estimate of 30 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was 268 million bushels. U.S. production was
forecast at 3.39 billion, up from 3.015 billion harvested last
year and above the 3.371 billion expected on average in a
Bloomberg survey.  Soybean futures for November delivery, after the harvest,
slipped 1 percent to $13.1425 a bushel on the CBOT, the second
decline this week. Prices are down 27 percent from a record
$17.89 in September on forecasts for record combined output in
 Brazil , the world’s top shipper of the oilseed, and  Argentina ,
the leading exporter of soy-based  animal feed  and cooking oil.  Increased supplies later this year may reduce feed costs
for meat producers including Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield
Foods Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
