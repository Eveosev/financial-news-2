Developers of solar projects on
Hokkaido are being forced to review their plans after the
Japanese island’s sole utility received applications for large-scale solar plants that would exceed the grid’s capacity.  Hokkaido Electric Power Co. (9509)  officials have met with
applicants to explain that it can’t add any more solar to its
grid if projects are 2 megawatts or larger, Satoshi Takada, a
spokesman for the utility, said in a phone interview.  By the end of March, applications for grid connections
totaled 1,568 megawatts for plants of 2 megawatts or larger,
according to an April 17  statement  from the utility, which said
it had capacity for only 400 megawatts.  The case highlights growing concern in Japan about
transmitting power from renewable sources to the nation’s grid
as the country expands solar installations following the July
2012 introduction of above-market rates for clean energy.  As one response, the Hokkaido utility plans to install a
storage battery system at its Minami Hayakita substation in the
southern town of Abira to stabilize the flow of solar power onto
the grid, according to Takada.  Hokkaido is attracting the biggest share of  Japan ’s solar
projects because it offers large patches of inexpensive land,
the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said in a  statement 
April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
