Asian  stocks  fell, extending a rout
that wiped out about $400 billion from the value of global
equities yesterday, amid concern that central banks from Tokyo
to Washington are increasingly reluctant to add stimulus.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, retreated
1.8 percent in Tokyo after the yen yesterday gained the most in
three years.  Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. (011200)  plunged 15 percent in
Seoul after North Korea called off talks yesterday on a joint
industrial zone.  Nomura Real Estate Master Fund Inc. (3285) , Japan’s
largest initial public offering this year, fell 6.2 percent in
its debut.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed at 131.65 as
of 8:44 p.m. in Tokyo, with about two shares falling for each
that advanced. Markets in China,  Hong Kong , Taiwan and the
Philippines were shut for holidays.  “There’s lots of confusion around the world at present
about what central bank policy means for the outlook of the
global economy, earnings and valuations,” Matthew Sherwood,
Sydney-based head of market research at Perpetual Ltd., which
manages about $25 billion, said by e-mail. “The Fed is likely
to continue to be ambiguous about its next step, probably
because it’s not sure. This will see markets continue to be
volatile.”  The  MSCI gauge  fell 8.9 percent through yesterday from this
year’s high on May 20 on speculation that an improving  U.S.
economy  will lead the  Federal Reserve  to scale back record
stimulus. In May, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy
makers could reduce the pace of bond buying should there be
sustained improvement in the U.S. economy.  Relative Value  The measure  traded  yesterday at 12.8 times average
estimated earnings, compared with 14.8 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A gauge of consumer discretionary companies in the Asia-Pacific index led gains  this year  as Japanese shares rallied on
a weaker yen and the promise of policies to end deflation.
Energy companies had the biggest declines amid concern that
China’s fuel demand will drop as growth slows.  Japan’s Topix index declined 0.4 percent after dropping 1
percent yesterday, when the  Bank of Japan  kept its policy
unchanged. Data today showed Japan machinery orders, an
indicator of future  capital spending , dropped 8.8 percent in
April, more than the 8.1 percent decline estimated by economists
in a Bloomberg survey.  Regional Gauges  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index retreated 0.7 percent, led by
energy and financial shares.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,
Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas producer, dropped 2
percent to A$34.67.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s No. 2
lender by market value, shed 1.2 percent to A$27.47.  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.5 percent. South Korea’s
Kospi index fell 0.6 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index
dropped 0.6 percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
gained 0.3 percent after the measure dropped 1 percent
yesterday.  Japanese exporters dropped after the yen gained 2.8 percent
against the dollar yesterday, the biggest rise since May 2010.
Toyota fell 1.8 percent to 5,860 yen.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an
automaker that gets 29 percent of its sales in North America,
sank 2.4 percent to 369 yen.  Hyundai Merchant slumped 15 percent to 13,300 won in Seoul
after the cancellation of inter-Korea talks. The discussion was
expected to include reopening a resort in Mt. Geumgang run by
Hyundai Asan Corp., in which Hyundai Merchant had a 66 percent
stake as of March 31, and Gaesong joint factory park.  Nomura Real Estate Master Fund fell 6.2 percent to 93,800
yen in its debut in Tokyo. The investment trust run by a unit of
the nation’s biggest brokerage sold 1.75 million shares in the
IPO and raised 175.1 billion yen ($1.8 billion), according to a
company statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
