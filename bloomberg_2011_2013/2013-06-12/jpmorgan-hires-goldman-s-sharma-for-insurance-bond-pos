JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s asset-management unit hired Prashant Sharma as head of international
fixed-income investments for insurance clients.  Sharma will be based in London and report to Nick Gartside,
international chief investment officer of fixed-income, New
York-based JPMorgan said today in an e-mailed statement. Sharma
previously worked at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s asset-management
business and has a decade of experience working as a fixed-income portfolio manager.  Asset managers including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock Inc.
have been expanding their offerings and adding staff to win
mandates from insurance companies as low interest rates pressure
income from bond portfolios. JPMorgan, which oversees about $50
billion for the industry, recently made additions in  Hong Kong 
and  Tokyo  for the insurance solutions business and last year
named Douglas Niemann, who previously worked at American
International Group Inc., to lead strategy and analytics.  “Fixed-income investing is extremely important to insurance
clients, particularly in the current low interest-rate
environment,” Gartside said in the statement. “However, their
investment needs as a client group are unique, and as our
insurance solutions business grows, Prashant’s dedicated
expertise will be integral to this.”  Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn’t immediately return a call for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
