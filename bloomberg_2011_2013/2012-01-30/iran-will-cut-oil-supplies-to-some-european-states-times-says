Iran  will cut oil exports to some
European nations in the near future in response to the European
Union’s imposition of a ban on Iranian oil imports starting from
July,  Tehran Times  reported, citing Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi.  Qasemi did not name the countries or give a time, according
to today’s report in the newspaper.  Iranian lawmakers have drafted legislation that calls on
the government to halt oil exports to  Europe  as long as the
import ban is in place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
