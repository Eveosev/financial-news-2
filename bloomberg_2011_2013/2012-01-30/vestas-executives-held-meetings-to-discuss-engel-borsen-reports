Members of  Vestas Wind Systems
A/S (VWS) ’s executive management team have held meetings to discuss
the performance of Chief Executive Officer  Ditlev Engel , Borsen
reported, citing sources close to the talks that the newspaper
didn’t identify by name.  Engel wasn’t present at the meetings, the Copenhagen-based
newspaper said. Deputy Chairman Torsten Erik Rasmussen confirmed
a meeting of members of the board and the executive management
team had taken place, while declining to elaborate, Borsen said.  Engel has the company’s support, the CEO told Borsen. The
tasks he faces at the moment are “difficult and complicated,”
Engel said, according to the newspaper. “I’ve been asked to
solve this task, and that’s what I’m doing. If I’m asked to step
down, then I’ll do that. It’s as simple as that,” Borsen cited
Engel as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
