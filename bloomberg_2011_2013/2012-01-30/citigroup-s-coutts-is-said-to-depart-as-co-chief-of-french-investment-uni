Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s co-chief country
officer and head of corporate and investment banking for  France ,
Eric Coutts, left the company as the lender reduces staff,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Coutts probably will be replaced as head of banking by
Charles-Henri Filippi, the French unit’s chairman, said the
person, who asked for anonymity because Filippi’s appointment
isn’t official. Arnaud de Marmies becomes sole chief country
officer, the person said.  Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit , 55, is cutting
bonuses and chopping headcount at the New York-based bank to
control expenses as revenue slumps. Pandit, who’s seeking to cut
as much as $3 billion from costs this year, may eliminate 5,000
jobs and has reduced investment bank bonuses by an average 30
percent, a person briefed on the matter has said.  Revenue at Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank, fell 10
percent in 2011 to $78.4 billion while expenses rose 7 percent
to $50.7 billion, compared with the prior year. Net income
increased 6 percent to $11.3 billion.  Coutts’ departure was reported earlier today by Reuters.
 Jeffrey French , a spokesman for Citigroup, said he couldn’t
comment on the staff changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
