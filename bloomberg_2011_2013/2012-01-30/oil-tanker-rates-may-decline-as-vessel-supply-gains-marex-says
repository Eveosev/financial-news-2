Charter rates for oil tankers
loading  Persian Gulf  crude may decline in the next several days
as supply of the vessels increases, broker Marex Spectron Group
Ltd. said.  There are 50 very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, available
to load in the middle 10 days of February compared with about
25 cargoes, Marexâ€™s freight-derivatives unit in Singapore
said in an e-mailed note today. That means freight rates may
decline even if demand accelerates following the end of holidays
in  China , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
