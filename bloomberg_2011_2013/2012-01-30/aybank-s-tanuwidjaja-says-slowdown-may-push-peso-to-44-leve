Enrico Tanuwidjaja, a senior
currency analyst in Singapore at Malayan Banking Bhd., comments
on the outlook for the Philippine economy and currency.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 42.835 per dollar as of 9:25
a.m. in  Manila . The Southeast Asian economy probably grew at an
annual rate of 3.8 percent in the final three months of 2011,
versus 3.2 percent in the preceding quarter, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before a government report due at 10 a.m.
local time.  “The Philippine trade performance has shifted to the
downside in the second half of last year and the central bank
may have anticipated the weakness by cutting its benchmark
 interest rate  earlier this month.  “The peso’s movement has been disparate with the
developments in the domestic economy. We expect to see the peso
in a 42.60 to 43.80 range today as sentiment looks like
consolidating for now.  “The first quarter of 2012 is still filled with some
uncertainty, especially on the Europe front. Should the GDP
number differs significantly on the downside, it could drive
dollar-peso toward 44.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
