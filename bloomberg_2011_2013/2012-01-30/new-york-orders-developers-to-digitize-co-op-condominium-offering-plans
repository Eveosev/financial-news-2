New York offering plans -- the large
books that lay out the rules and regulations for cooperatives,
condominiums, homeowners associations or timeshares -- are going
online, according to the state’s attorney general.  Beginning April 1, developers will be required to give
prospective purchasers or members the option of receiving plans
in a searchable digital format,  Eric Schneiderman  said today in
an e-mailed statement.  The attorney general “is taking further steps in the right
direction,” said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate
Board of New York. He added that REBNY was involved with
Schneiderman in crafting the new policy, and that many
condominiums already provide such digital copies.  Schneiderman, named last week by U.S. President  Barack Obama  to help lead a state-federal investigation of
securitizations, has been seeking to make more housing
information available electronically. In December, his office
made its database of offering plans accessible on its website.  Under the new rule, prospective purchasers who prefer a
hard copy will still be able to request them from developers, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
