Swedish Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  said 25 European Union countries -- all but the  Czech
Republic  and the U.K. -- agreed to join a fiscal compact
intended to toughen budget discipline across the region.  “The Czech Republic said that because of ratification
reasons they could not say yes tonight,” Reinfeldt told
reporters in Brussels during a meeting of EU leaders. “The U.K.
has already said before that they will not be part of this.”  Sweden ’s concerns about the accord were satisfied in
today’s talks, Reinfeldt said. “This has no legal impact on
Sweden as such, he said. “Our Swedish wage-setting model is
respected. There is a presence for Sweden even though we are not
part of the euro, and it is also confirmed that we can take our
own decision if we want to join the euro in the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
