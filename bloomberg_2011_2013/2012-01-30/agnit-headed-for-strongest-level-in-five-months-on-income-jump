OAO Magnit,  Russia â€™s biggest
retailer by number of stores, headed for its strongest close in
five months after boosting net income 20 percent to 12.2 billion
rubles ($401 million) last year as it increased selling space.  The shares rose for a third day, adding 1.3 percent to
3,313.10 rubles as of 1:02 p.m. in Moscow. A close at that level
would be their highest since Aug. 17. The 30-stock Micex Index
retreated 0.8 percent to 1,496.80.  To contact the reporter on this story:
