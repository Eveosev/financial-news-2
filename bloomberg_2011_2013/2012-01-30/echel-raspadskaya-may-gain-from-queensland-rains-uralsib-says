OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  and OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP) ,
Russian producers of coal used in steelmaking, may benefit from
any disruption to supplies from  Australia  caused by heavy rains
in Queensland, UralSib Financial Corp. said.  Australia’s coal industry hasn’t fully recovered from last
year’s flooding and even mild rainfall in Queensland could pose
“serious problems” for producers, UralSib analyst Dmitry Smolin wrote in a note to clients today.  “Russia’s exporters of coking coal are arguably the only
alternative to Australian producers for Asian steelmakers,”
Moscow-based Smolin wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
