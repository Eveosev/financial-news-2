Russian farmers may reap 98 million
to 100 million metric tons of grain in 2012 with winter
plantings probably escaping frost damage, OOO ProZerno said.  “We need to wait until the end of frosts to see the actual
winter grains loss,” Vladimir Petrichenko, director of the
Moscow-based agriculture researcher and consultancy, said today
by phone in the Russian capital. “The current outlook does not
show any big damage to crops.”  Snow has covered all fields in the southern regions,
traditionally the country’s main grain exporting areas, he said.
It’s snowing now in southern areas that had no snow earlier this
month, he said.  Russia  harvested 93.9 million tons of grains in 2011 after
drying and cleaning, Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service
said Jan. 26. The next crop may exceed last year’s, First Deputy
Prime Minister  Viktor Zubkov  said Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
