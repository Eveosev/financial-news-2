Taiwan’s unemployment rate
unexpectedly fell in December, dropping to the lowest in more
than three years as restaurants and hotels stepped up hiring.  The  seasonally adjusted rate  declined to 4.22 percent from
4.32 percent in November, the statistics bureau said in Taipei
today. That compared with the 4.33 percent median estimate of
six economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News and is the lowest
level since August 2008.  “The service and retail sectors are still resilient
because of the year-end holiday demand, and they partially
offset the weakness in the electronics sector,” Scott Chen, an
economist at Bank SinoPac in Taipei, said before the report. The
central bank will probably hold borrowing costs at 1.875 percent
at its quarterly rate meeting in March, he said.  Asian policy makers from  Thailand  to  India  have cut
borrowing costs or refrained from further increases in recent
meetings to shield domestic growth and counter risks from
 Europe ’s protracted debt crisis. The island’s job market has
come under pressure from the weak global economic outlook, with
export orders last month falling for the first time since 2009.  The  Taiex stock index  closed 2.4 percent higher. The  Taiwan
dollar  rose 0.7 percent to NT$29.786 against its U.S.
counterpart at the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  A total of 91 companies reached agreements with 11,630
workers to take unpaid leave as of Jan. 15, the Council of Labor
Affairs said this month. The number of unemployed fell to
475,000 in December from 485,000 in November, on a seasonally
adjusted basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
