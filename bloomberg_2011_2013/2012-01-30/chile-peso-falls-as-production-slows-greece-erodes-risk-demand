Chile ’s peso snapped a three-day
winning streak as concerns about Greek debt dented demand for
emerging-market currencies and data showed domestic
manufacturing grew less than analysts forecast in December.  The peso declined 0.7 percent to 487.96 per  U.S. dollar  as
of 10:25 a.m. in Santiago from 484.55 on Jan. 27, which was the
strongest closing level since September. The Bloomberg JPMorgan
Latin American Currency Index  declined  0.6 percent.  Stocks and commodities, including Chile’s biggest export,
copper, fell on reports  Greece ’s Finance Minister blocked plans
to allow the European Union to directly intervene in its budget
planning. The peso extended losses today after the National
Statistics Institute said Chile’s industrial output grew 0.5
percent in December, trailing the 1.2 percent median forecast of
eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The scenario doesn’t look good at all,” said Andres de
la Cerda, a money-markets trader at Bice Inversiones in
Santiago. “Local data was bad, copper fell and the stocks and
futures screens are all red. This is a reaction to international
markets, but the local data doesn’t help at all.”  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
increased their short position in the currency to $4.4 billion
on Jan. 26 from $4.2 billion on Jan. 25, according to central
bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
