Protesters who’ve been camped out in
a public park in downtown  Washington , D.C., draped a giant blue
tarp over a statue of a Civil War hero, trying to test whether
they’d be thrown out of McPherson Square.  Sunset fell without any forcible evictions.  The U.S. Park Police had set a deadline of noon today for
protesters in McPherson Square and the Freedom Plaza site on
Pennsylvania Avenue to comply with a ban on camping.  Sergeant David Schlosser, a Park Police spokesman, didn’t
return messages seeking comment.  Protesters flung a tarp over the sculpted head of Maj. Gen.
James McPherson and called it their “tent of dreams.” Members
of the movement, which is affiliated with Occupy  Wall Street ,
expected the police to move in to uncover the statue, spokesman
Legba Carrefour said in a phone interview.  He called the tent part of a strategy to “force the
point” and demonstrate the group’s unity.  Some protesters had removed their belongings so the
encampment would better qualify as a temporary protest site,
Carrefour said.  NI US
