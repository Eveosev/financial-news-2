The regulator of the $3.7 trillion
U.S. municipal-bond market is seeking rules to prevent
overcharging by firms that resell debt for brokers and to ensure
that individual investors have access to new securities.  The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which crafts
regulations for state and local governments, also wants to force
better disclosure of pricings in bond offerings, Alan Polsky, a
vice president with Dougherty & Co. and the chairman of the
MSRB, told reporters on a conference call today. The board
approved the steps during its meeting last week, he said.  The MSRB rules are subject to the approval of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
