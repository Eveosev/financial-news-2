Ukrainian corn planting will
probably rise 25 percent to 4.5 million hectares (11.1 million
acres) for the 2012 harvest, according to the Ukrainian
Agribusiness Club.  Farmers are likely to reap as much as 25 million metric
tons of the grain, compared with 22.8 million tons in 2011, the
Kiev-based organization said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
