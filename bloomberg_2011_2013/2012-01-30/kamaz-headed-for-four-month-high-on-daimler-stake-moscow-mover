OAO  KamAZ (KMAZ) , Russiaâ€™s biggest
truckmaker, was poised for its strongest level in four months,
after the head of its state-owned shareholder said  Daimler AG (DAI)  is
seeking to gain a controlling stake.  The stock jumped as much as 23 percent, and traded up 14
percent at 44.66 rubles as of 5:58 p.m. in Moscow. A close at
that level would be its highest since Sept. 21.  Russian Technologies Corp. is ready to sell a KamAZ stake
to Daimler,  Sergei Chemezov  told reporters today in the
Leningrad region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
