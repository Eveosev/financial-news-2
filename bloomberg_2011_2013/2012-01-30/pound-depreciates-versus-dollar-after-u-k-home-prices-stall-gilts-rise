U.K. gilts rose, with 10-year yields
dropping the most in seven weeks, as investors favored safer
assets as European Union leaders met for their first summit of
2012 amid concern the region’s growth is slowing.  Gilts outperformed German bunds and the pound strengthened
against the euro as the Greek government and its creditors
struggled to reach agreement on a debt-swap plan for the nation.
Sterling fell for the first time in five days against the dollar
after property researcher Hometrack Ltd. said U.K. home prices
stalled last month and remain under “downward pressure.”  “There’s a bit of a move toward the safe havens again,”
said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Investec
Capital Markets in London. “The repeated lack of political
consensus within the euro area is quite worrying. Obviously
that’s much more of a worry for the peripherals than it is for
the core Europeans, and then even less so for outside of the
 euro zone , and that’s why the U.K. is benefitting.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.99 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
dropping as much as nine basis points, the most since Dec. 8.
The 3.75 percent bond due September 2021 rose 0.733, or 7.33
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,567) face amount, to 115.328.  Two-
year (GUKG2)  yields declined two basis points to 0.36 percent.  Spread Shrinks  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds shrank for a second
day, narrowing one basis point to 20 basis points.  EU chiefs met in Brussels hoping to put the finishing
touches on a German-led deficit-control treaty and endorse the
statutes of a 500 billion-euro ($656 billion) rescue fund to be
set up this year.  Efforts to hold the euro area together with stronger fiscal
rules and a sturdier firewall are colliding with stalled
progress in  Greece . The Greek government rejected a plan over
the weekend that would give European institutions powers to
implement austerity measures agreed under the terms of its
bailout agreements, while the Financial Times reported  Germany 
is proposing the creation of a commissioner, with power to veto
Greece’s budget decisions.  The pound climbed 0.5 percent to 83.61 pence per euro,
paring its monthly loss to 0.3 percent.  Gilts have handed investors a 0.5 percent loss this month,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German  government
bonds  declined 0.4 percent.  Debt Sales  The U.K. plans to auction as much as 7.25 billion pounds of
debt this week, starting with a 2.5 billion-pound sale of notes
maturing in 2025 on Feb. 1.  The pound declined from near a five-week high against the
dollar after Hometrack said U.K. home prices were unchanged in
January. The underlying trend is one of “tightening supply and
weakening demand,” the London-based company said in an e-mailed
report to clients.  Sterling slid 0.3 percent to $1.5676 after rising to $1.574
on Jan. 27, the highest since Dec. 21. It dropped 0.7 percent to
119.74 yen.  Sterling has weakened 1.1 percent in January, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar declined 2.1 percent,
and the euro dropped 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
