Shandong Helon Co. (000677) ,  China ’s first
company to lose its investment-grade credit rating, expects to
post a loss of 1 billion yuan ($158 million) for last year, the
fiber maker said in a stock exchange filing today.  “Affected by the macroeconomic conditions, the chemical
fiber industry underwent a downturn in 2011,” Helon said in a
statement to Shenzhen’s stock exchange. “Sales prices dropped
sharply in 2011, while raw-materials and production costs remain
high, all of which led to a sharp loss for the year.”  Helon, based in Weifang in China’s eastern Shandong
province, said Jan. 6 it had 397 million yuan in overdue loans
with banks, accounting for 119 percent of the company’s net
assets as of its latest audit.  China Lianhe  Credit Rating  Co., one of the nation’s largest
credit rating companies, cut its assessment for Helon in
