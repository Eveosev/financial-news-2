African heads of state continue
their annual African Union summit in  Addis Ababa ,  Ethiopia ’s
capital, today. The meeting, which started yesterday, has a
theme of boosting intra-Africa trade and included statements
from AU chairman Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the current
president of  Equatorial Guinea , and United Nations Secretary-
General Ban Ki-Moon, according to the agenda.  Nigeria ’s central bank announces its decision on whether to
adjust its key interest rate tomorrow in Abuja, the capital. The
rate, which was left unchanged at a record-high 12 percent on
Nov. 21, may be held “for a bit” as increases in fuel prices
add pressure to inflation, central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi
said Jan. 16.  Central banks in Kenya and Uganda will also meet to decide
on lending rates on Feb. 1. Kenya held its key rate at 18
percent on Jan. 11 and  Uganda ’s rate was maintained at 23
percent on Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
