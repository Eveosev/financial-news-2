News Corp. (NWSA)  said Teri Everett will
depart next month, the third communications executive to leave
the company since December, and will be replaced by  Julie Henderson .  Everett, who joined News Corp. in 2000, will depart on
Feb. 10, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Her current title is senior vice president for corporate affairs
and communications. She said in the statement that she is
“ready for something new,” without elaborating.  Henderson will become senior vice president for corporate
affairs and chief communications officer. She has managed
corporate communications for the company’s West Coast companies
such as movie studio 20th Century Fox. Henderson will split her
time between Los Angeles and New York, reporting to Chief
Operating Officer  Chase Carey , according to the statement.  News Corp. is trying to manage the fallout from the phone-
hacking scandal at its U.K. unit that has led to the arrests of
at least 20 people, though no one has been charged. Alice Macandrew, the company’s former head of public relations in
Europe, left last month. The departure of  Matthew Anderson , a
strategy adviser to Deputy Chief Operating Officer James Murdoch, was announced last week.  News Corp. rose 1.1 percent to $19.09 at the close in New
York. The  shares  have gained 7 percent this year.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
News Corp. units in providing financial news and information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
