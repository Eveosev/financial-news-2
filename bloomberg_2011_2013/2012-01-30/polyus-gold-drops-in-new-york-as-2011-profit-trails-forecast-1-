Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLGL) ,
 Russia ’s largest producer of the metal, fell the most in two
weeks in U.S. trading after reporting that 2011 earnings lagged
behind analysts’ predictions.  Polyus’s  American depositary receipts  fell 3.6 percent to
settle at $3.19 in  New York , the steepest drop since Jan. 17.
The stock dropped as much as 4.8 percent earlier in the session.
The miner was the second-worst performer on the  Bloomberg
Russia-US 14 Index  of Russian companies traded in New York after
CTC Media. The benchmark slid 1.2 percent.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose to about $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion last
year from $717 million in 2010, Polyus said today in a
preliminary results statement. That was below the $1.15 billion
average  estimate  of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
