Asian  stocks  fell, with a regional
benchmark index dropping from a three-month high, ahead of a
European summit on the region’s debt crisis and after the  U.S.
economy  expanded less than forecast, hurting the earnings
outlook for exporters.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building materials supplier
that counts the U.S. as its biggest market, fell 1.7 percent in
Sydney.  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  slumped 15 percent after Japan
barred the electronics maker from bidding on state contracts.
 Country Garden Holdings Co. (2007)  led Chinese developers lower in  Hong
Kong  after reports showed home sales in the four biggest cities
fell during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index decreased 1 percent to 121.85
as of 7:32 p.m. in  Tokyo , with more than two shares falling for
each that rose. The measure has risen the past six weeks, the
longest streak since a seven-week stretch that ended Oct. 15,
2010, amid bets  China  will ease lending curb, the U.S. economy
is improving and  Europe  is containing its debts crisis.  “I don’t expect the rally to be sustainable,” said
 Pauline Dan , who helps oversee $480 million as chief investment
officer at Samsung Asset Management in Hong Kong. “There will
still be volatility. I don’t think we’ve seen the worst of the
European situation.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  slid 0.5 percent, while South
Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 1.2 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index slipped 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined
1.7 percent.  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 1.5 percent as it
resumed trading following the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.
Taiwan’s Taiex Index, which was also shut last week, jumped 2.4
percent.  ‘Looks Overheated’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.7
percent today. The gauge lost 0.2 percent in  New York  on Jan. 27
after a report showed the U.S. economy grew at a 2.8 percent
annualized rate in the three months through December, compared
with estimates for a 3 percent rise.  Exporters to the U.S. declined. James Hardie slipped 1.7
percent to A$7.15 in Sydney.  Li & Fung Ltd. , a supplier of toys
and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., sank 4.9 percent to
HK$17.50.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker by
market value, slid 1.7 percent to 2,789 yen in Tokyo.  “The U.S. growth number was below forecast and that’s a
negative,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-
based Monex Group Inc., an online brokerage. “The market looks
overheated, so investors are likely to use the report as an
excuse to sell and lock in profit.”  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , India’s biggest maker of
power equipment, sank 11 percent to 244.15 rupees in Mumbai. The
company said net income rose 1.9 percent to 14.3 billion rupees
($289 million) in the quarter ended Dec. 31. That compares with
the 14.8 billion-rupee average estimate of 30 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Biggest Decline  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 8.1 percent this year
through Jan. 27, compared with increases of 4.7 percent by the
S&P 500 and 4.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark were valued at 1.3 times book value. That
compares with 2.2 times for the S&P 500 in the U.S. and 1.4
times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Mitsubishi Electric tumbled 15 percent to 650 yen, the
biggest decline on the MSCI Asian gauge. The Japanese government
has prohibited the company from joining bids until it returns
money from projects on which it charged excessive fees, the
company said in a Jan. 27 statement.  The inflated charges include a 33.6 billion yen ($438
million) contract to design guided missiles for the defense
ministry in 2010, Takaaki Ohno, a spokesman at the ministry,
said by telephone today.  ‘Too Optimistic’  Chinese developers and lenders declined in Hong Kong. Home
sales in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen fell 66
percent to 109 units compared with the holiday period a year
earlier, according to an e-mailed report today from Centaline
Property Agency Ltd., China’s biggest real-estate brokerage.
Stocks also declined after the central bank refrained cutting
reserve requirements for lenders during the break.  “The weak holiday sales struck investors as they probably
were too optimistic that the government may ease curbs anytime
soon,” said Danny Bao, a Hong Kong-based property analyst for
Daiwa Securities Capital Markets.  Country Garden plunged 11 percent to HK$3.22.  China
Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. , the biggest mainland developer
listed in Hong Kong, declined 3.1 percent to HK$14.52.
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the world’s largest
lender by market value, dropped 3 percent to HK$5.42.  Companies that get revenue from Europe also declined before
European Union leaders gather today for their first summit of
2012 as a deteriorating economy and struggle to complete a Greek
debt write-off risk sidetracking efforts to contain the
financial crisis.  Cosco Pacific Ltd., which operates a port in Greece,
declined 3.4 percent to HK$10.84 in Hong Kong.  Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd. (13) , the retailer, port operator and phone company that counts
Europe as its largest market, lost 1.4 percent to HK$72.50.
Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets about 32 percent of sales
from Europe, slid 1 percent to 3,435 yen in Tokyo.  Mining Accident  Raw material producers fell after crude oil and copper
futures declined. The  London Metals Exchange Index (LMEX) , which tracks
prices of six industrial metals including aluminum and copper,
lost 0.6 percent on Jan. 27.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) , China’s biggest producer of the metal,
declined 4 percent to HK$19.96. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.,
the nation’s largest supplier of the light metal, dropped 3.4
percent to HK$3.93. Glencore International Plc, the world’s No.
1 commodity trader, fell 2.4 percent to HK$51.  Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s largest gold producer, sank
4.2 percent to HK$3.43 after three workers died in an accident
at a copper smelting unit.  Nippon Electric Glass Co. slumped 10 percent to 670 yen
after saying profit may fall by at least 54 percent to 31.5
billion yen in the year ending March 31 on slumping demand for
glass used in TVs and cameras.  Among stocks that gained,  Advantest Corp. (6857) , a maker of
memory-chip testers, jumped 12 percent to 817 yen after saying
it plans to raise its full-year dividend to 15 yen per share
from 10 yen a year earlier. The shares also got a boost after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. lifted its target price to 700 yen from 650
yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
