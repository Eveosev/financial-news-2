New Jersey ’s property taxes, the
highest in the nation, climbed 2.4 percent on average to a high
of $7,759 in 2011, according to data posted on a state website.  The gain follows a 4.1 percent jump in real estate taxes,
the prime funding source for schools and local governments, in
2010. After property-tax rebates and credits, the average bill
was $7,519 in 2011, up 20 percent from 2009, the data show.  New Jersey governors before  Chris Christie  used rebates and
credits to help residents deal with their rising real estate
bills. Christie, a Republican who took office in January 2010,
scaled back the payments in his first budget. In 2009, residents
got $1,037 in rebates back on average. Last year, the average
was $240.  “We’ve tried these programs for 30 years and they haven’t
worked,” Christie, 49, said of the rebates. “It doesn’t make
sense to take money out of peoples’ right pockets to put it back
in their left one.”  The 2.4 percent increase last year was the smallest in at
least a decade. Property taxes increased about 7 percent
annually in 2004, 2005 and 2006 before the rate began to slow.  Tax Cap  Limiting spending growth and property-tax increases are
more effective tools for controlling the levies in the long term
than giving rebates and credits, Christie told reporters today.  Christie enacted a 2 percent cap on property taxes that
took effect at the beginning of 2011. The measure reduced the 4
percent limit enacted by Christie’s predecessor, Democrat  Jon Corzine . It also cut the number of exemptions to four from 14.  Under the Corzine system, towns sought cap waivers from the
state’s Local Finance Board. Christie’s measure required a voter
referendum. In April, 14 of 566 communities asked voters to
exceed the cap, and just two increases were approved.  Lisa Ryan , a spokeswoman for the state Community Affairs
department, which tracks the property-tax data, declined to
immediately comment on the figures.  Property taxes in New Jersey have increased 66 percent
since 2001, when they averaged $4,661, the data show.  Christie this month proposed reducing income-tax rates for
every state resident by 10 percent to provide relief from the
“burden that has strangled our families and forced many to move
away.” Democrats, who control both houses of the Legislature,
say Christie’s proposal would favor the wealthy, and they want
to focus on relieving pressure from property taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
