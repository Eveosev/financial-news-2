New York gasoline weakened amid
speculation that  ConocoPhillips (COP)  started a catalytic cracker
after maintenance at the Bayway refinery in  New Jersey .  The fluid catalytic cracker “restarted over the weekend,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. Conoco scheduled the shutdown on Jan. 27, according to
a filing with the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or  RBOB (MOSN87PM) , in the New York
Harbor market strengthened 0.5 cent to a discount of 0.75 cent a
gallon versus futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 12:10 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery fell 5.02 cents to $2.8741 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGR87P)  fell 0.8 cent to a premium
of 1.7 cents versus futures.  The Bayway plant can process 238,000 barrels of crude a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “ConocoPhillips typically does not comment on day-to-day
refinery operations or regulatory notifications,” Rich Johnson,
a Houston-based spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail.  Hess Corp. (HES)  may shut a fluid catalytic cracker at the Port
Reading refinery in New Jersey for about three weeks after
assessing repairs to the unit, the company said Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
