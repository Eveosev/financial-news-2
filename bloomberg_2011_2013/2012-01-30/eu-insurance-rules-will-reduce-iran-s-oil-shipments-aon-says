European Union sanctions on Iranian
oil will lead to a reduction in the Persian Gulf nation’s
exports as tanker owners won’t be able to insure ships visiting
the country, said Simon Schnorr, the London-based marine client
director at Aon Risk Solutions, a unit of the world’s largest
insurance broker.  The 27-nation bloc agreed Jan. 23 to bar the purchase,
transport, financing and insurance of Iranian oil exports.
Tanker owners will struggle to find insurance that doesn’t
comply with EU law because the London-based  International Group 
of P&I Clubs insures 95 percent of the fleet and other companies
probably won’t have the funds needed to meet the “standard
cover provision” of $1 billion for pollution liabilities,
Schnorr said Jan. 26. Following are comments Schnorr made by
phone today.  “Less oil will be shipped out of  Iran  because ship owners
won’t be able to do it without losing their insurance. As soon
as a ship engages in a voyage to Iran, its cover will be null
and void.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
