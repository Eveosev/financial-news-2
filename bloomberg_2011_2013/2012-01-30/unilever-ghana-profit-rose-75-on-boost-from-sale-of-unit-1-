Unilever Ghana Ltd. (UNIL) , a maker of
household products in the West African nation, said net income
rose 75 percent to 39.9 million cedis ($24 million) last year on
earnings from the sale of its palm-oil unit.  Unilever sold its 58 percent stake in Benso Oil Palm
Plantation Ltd. to Wilmar Africa Ltd., a subsidiary of  Wilmar
International Ltd. (WIL) , in March last year for almost 23 million
cedis. Benso’s net income more than tripled to 9.8 million cedis
last year, it said today.  Unilever, which makes Lux soap, Blue Band margarine and Omo
laundry power, said revenue rose 33 percent to 240.9 million
cedis, the Tema, Ghana-based company said in a statement
published in the Ghanaian Times newspaper today.  “The company was able to penetrate more into the markets
with its products,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Accra-based
Databank Financial Services Ltd., said by phone today. “It
improved and repackaged some of the products for target
markets.”  Unilever shares were unchanged at 6.97 cedis in Accra, the
capital, today. The stock may “trade aggressively from now to
the end of the third quarter on the back of performance,” said
Mensah. “Revenue and profitability look northwards, driven by
increased consumer demand as disposable incomes rise.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
