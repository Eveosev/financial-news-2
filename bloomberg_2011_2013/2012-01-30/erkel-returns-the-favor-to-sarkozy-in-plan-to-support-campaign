Chancellor Angela Merkel  said she
will support President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in the French
presidential campaign, reciprocating his electoral backing for
her three years ago.  Merkel, who was asked after a European Union summit whether
a Sarkozy defeat would knock Franco-German crisis measures off
course, made reference to a 2009 campaign event at Berlin’s Sony
Center. There, Sarkozy campaigned for her along with youth
members of her  Christian Democratic Union .  “Nicolas Sarkozy supported me back then in an election
campaign -- if you remember, in the Sony Center, the big event
with the Young Union,” Merkel told reporters in Brussels late
yesterday. “So I’ll give back to him what he offered to me in
the same way. This has nothing to do with being concerned, it’s
simply a common practice between our two countries.”  Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande  is leading Sarkozy
in polls ahead of the two-round presidential elections in April
and May. Asked whether she was concerned that France wouldn’t be
able to ratify new fiscal rules before an election could unseat
the incumbent, Merkel said the EU functions best based on the
principal of “continuity.”  “I’m actually quite relaxed if one asks about how the
presidential election will turn out,” Merkel said. “Europe
wouldn’t function if everything we’ve decided were thrown into
question with every change of government.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
