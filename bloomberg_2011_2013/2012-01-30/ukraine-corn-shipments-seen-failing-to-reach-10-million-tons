Ukraine corn exports may total less
than 10 million metric tons in the marketing year ending June 30
on low quality and storage difficulties, according to
UkrAgroConsult.  “It cannot be ruled out that corn exports in the season
ending June 30 will be lower than 10 million tons,” Liza Malyshko, a grain analyst at the Kiev-based agriculture
researcher, said today by phone. “There were problems with
storage and it is already difficult to find corn with quality
suitable for exports.”  Corn shipments reached 4.2 million tons from July 1 through
December, and exports will probably be about 1.5 million tons a
month in January and February, Malyshko said. Ukraine’s corn
exports usually decline from March through June.  The exportable corn surplus in the marketing year is 12
million tons, according to UkrAgroConsult calculations, Malyshko
said. The researcher’s export estimate is currently 10.2 million
tons, with carryover stocks seen at 1.5 million tons, she said.  The stockpiles will probably consist of low-quality grain,
she said. UkrAgroConsult anticipates a “big” corn harvest loss
of 900,000 tons, compared with the average of 400,000 tons to
500,000 tons, as fractured corn grains can’t be stored for long
periods, Malyshko said. Most of the corn crop was harvested
during an autumn drought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
