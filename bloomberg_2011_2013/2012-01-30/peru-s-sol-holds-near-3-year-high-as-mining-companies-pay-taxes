Peru ’s sol held near its strongest
level in three years as mining companies sold dollars to pay
local taxes.  The sol traded as 2.6905 per  U.S. dollar  at the close of
trading, little changed from 2.69 on Jan. 27, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The sol touched 2.6890 a week
ago, its strongest level since at least December 2008.  Mining companies seeking to pay taxes in soles sold “a lot
of” dollars to local banks last week to take advantage of a
stronger greenback, said Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco
Internacional del Peru in Lima. The central bank continued to
purchase those dollars from the banks today to temper the sol’s
appreciation, Diaz said.  “The only way out for this increased supply of dollars is
via the central bank,” Diaz said.  The central bank  bought  $63 million in the spot market
today after purchasing $426 million last week, according to its
website.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.72 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.09 centimo to 114.12 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
