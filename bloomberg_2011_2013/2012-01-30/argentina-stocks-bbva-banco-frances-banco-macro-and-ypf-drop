The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 1:27 p.m. in Buenos
Aires.  The  Merval (MERVAL)  Index fell 2.1 percent to 2,773.50.  YPF SA (YPFD)  , Argentina’s largest oil company, fell
3.3 percent to 177.5 pesos. Newspaper Pagina12 reported that
Argentine officials have discussed a takeover of the Repsol
unit. A YPF press official, who asked not to be named in
accordance with company policy, declined to comment.  BBVA Banco Frances SA (FRAN)  , the local unit of Spain’s
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, decreased 4.3 percent to
9.18 pesos. Banco Frances “appears most at risk” from new
restrictions that raise the amount of capital banks must hold in
order to pay dividends, Tito Labarta, an analyst at Deutsche
Bank, said in a research note today. The excess capital it holds
above the minimum requirement will “significantly” limit its
ability to pay dividends this year.  Banco Macro SA (BMA AF),  Argentina ’s largest lender by
market share, fell 3 percent to 11.45 pesos. Banco Macro may
face a “much smaller impact,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
