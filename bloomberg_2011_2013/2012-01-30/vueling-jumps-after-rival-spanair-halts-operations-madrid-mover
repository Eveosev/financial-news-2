Vueling Airlines SA (VLG) , a Spanish low-
cost carrier, surged the most in more than three years after
competitor Spanair SA ceased operations as  Qatar Airways  Ltd.
withdrew from a bid and the regional government halted funding.  Vueling rose 25 percent, the biggest advance since Oct. 22,
2008, to 5.10 euros in Madrid. That gave the Barcelona-based
airline a value of 152.5 million euros ($200.1 million). Vueling
said today it will boost capacity by 25 percent this summer from
a year earlier and plans 33 new flights and five new routes.  “Even as Spanair’s closure isn’t surprising, we believe
this is good news for Vueling and it should have a positive
impact in the value of the stock,” Alfredo del Cerro, an
analyst at Banesto Bolsa based in Madrid, wrote in a report to
investors today.  Spanair ceased operations Jan. 27 and may seek protection
from creditors this week. The Barcelona-based airline’s collapse
is the first of a scheduled European carrier since the last
recession. Cash-strapped European governments are considering
whether to dispose of at least half a dozen other airlines in
auctions pitting Qatar Airways and other emerging-market bidders
against  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group,  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and British
Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
