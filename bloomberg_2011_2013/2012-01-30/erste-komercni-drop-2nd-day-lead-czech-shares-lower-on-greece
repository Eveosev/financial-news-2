Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA, and  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  of Austria led
Czech shares lower for a second day as Greece tangled with
European Union officials over terms of a second rescue package.  The  PX (PX)  equity gauge slid 2.1 percent to 947.8 at the end of
trading in Prague, the largest slump since Jan. 5. Komercni
Banka, which has a 17 percent weighting in the index, slid 5.3
percent, its biggest one-day drop in almost three months. Erste,
with a 20 percent weighting, tumbled 3.9 percent.  Global stocks fell after German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said Greece’s aid program won’t be finalized today because talks
with banks over debt reduction aren’t completed. Greek Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos yesterday rejected reports of plans
to appoint a commissioner to oversee the nation’s budget. SocGen
dropped 6.2 percent in Paris after President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said he will impose a financial-transaction tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
