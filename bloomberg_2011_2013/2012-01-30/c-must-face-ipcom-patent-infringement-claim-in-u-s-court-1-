HTC Corp. (2498) , the world’s largest maker
of mobile phones using Google Inc.’s Android system, must face a
patent-infringement claim brought by  IPCom GmbH (0065736D)  in a U.S. court.  An appeals court said today that a lower court judge in
2010 was wrong to invalidate an IPCom patent that the closely
held company was using against HTC in a dispute over mobile-
device base stations. The case is being sent back to the judge,
who can consider additional arguments on the validity of the
patent, according to the  ruling  posted on website of the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in  Washington .  HTC, based in Taoyuan, Taiwan, sued Pullach, Germany-based
IPCom in 2008 to challenge the patent, which covers a way to
maintain service as a mobile phone moves from one coverage area
to another. The companies have sued each other in the U.S., U.K.
and  Germany .  IPCom (0065736D)  is seeking royalties from a family of mobile-
technology patents it acquired in 2007 from Robert Bosch GmbH,
the world’s largest automotive supplier. IPCom bought the
patents after Bosch failed to license them to  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  in 2003.  In addition to patent claims against HTC, IPCom has sued
stores in Germany that sell HTC’s 3G mobile phones.  The case is HTC Corp. v. IPCom GmbH, 11-1004, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower court
case is HTC Corp. v. IPCom GmbH, 08cv1897, U.S. District Court
for the  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
