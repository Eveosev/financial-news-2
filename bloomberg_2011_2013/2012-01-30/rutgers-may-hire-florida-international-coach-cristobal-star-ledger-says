Rutgers University  is close to
hiring  Florida International University  football coach Mario Cristobal to succeed Greg Schiano, the Newark Star-Ledger
reports.  Cristobal, 41, is in the middle of negotiations with
Rutgers, where he was an assistant from 2001 to 2003, the
newspaper reported today citing two unidentified people familiar
with the talks. Should an agreement be reached, it would need
approval from the  New Brunswick ,  New Jersey , school’s board.  Rutgers athletics spokesman Jason Baum didn’t immediately
respond to a voicemail seeking comment on the report.  Schiano was hired last week by the  National Football
League ’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, ending an 11-year run in which
the Scarlet Knights won five of six bowl games.  Cristobal was hired by FIU in December 2006 following a
0-12 season. In the past two years, the Miami-based Golden
Panthers are a combined 15-11, with two bowl appearances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
