European Central Bank Governing
Council member Jozef Makuch said there is “some” probability
that the euro area will fall into recession.  Speaking in an interview for  Hospodarske Noviny , Makuch
also said governments in countries sharing the euro are
responsible for finding a solution to the region’s debt crisis.
Administrations must cut excessive fiscal deficits and reach
structurally-balanced budgets, said Makuch, who is also the head
of the Slovak central bank.  A break-up of the euro area isn’t realistic as it would
hurt individual members and their global position, Makuch said.
He also said it isn’t likely that a country other than  Greece 
will need to write down part of its debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
