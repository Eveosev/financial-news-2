Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  fell the
most in 10 months in  Tokyo  trading after Japan barred the
company from competitive bidding for government orders because
it overcharged for some defense and aerospace contracts.  Mitsubishi Electric, whose businesses include factory-
automation equipment,  satellites  and electronics, declined as
much as 15 percent, the most on an intraday basis since March
15. It traded 13 percent lower at 666 yen as of 1:20 p.m. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, while Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average fell 0.5 percent.  The government has prohibited Mitsubishi Electric from
joining bids until it returns money and takes preventive
measures, the Tokyo-based company said in a Jan. 27 statement on
the excessive fees. The inflated charges include a 33.6 billion
yen ($438 million) contract from the defense ministry to design
guided missiles in 2010, Takaaki Ohno, a spokesman at the
ministry, said by telephone today.  “It may be hard to lure investors until the company clears
the problem,” said Tsunenori Ohmaki, a Tokyo-based analyst at
Tachibana Securities Co., who has a “strong outperform” rating
on the stock. “The situation is still unclear.”  Mitsubishi Electric won 628 contracts valued at about 120
billion yen from the defense ministry in the year ended March
2011, Ohno said. The company gets sales of between 70 billion
yen and 80 billion yen a year from its aerospace division, it
said in a faxed statement. It declined to say how much of its
revenue comes from the government, it said in a separate e-
mailed statement today.  The company, which had sales of 3.65 trillion yen last
fiscal year, is still investigating the overcharged amount and
the impact on earnings, it said in the Jan. 27 statement.  Japan  will ask the company for refunds, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Osamu Fujimura said in Tokyo on Jan. 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
