Heavy rains this weekend in
Cameroon’s main cocoa production area drove away caterpillars
that have been attacking the crop during the past three weeks,
the Ministry of Agriculture said.  The caterpillars had fallen on cocoa leaves in the
southwest region and “consumed them with an aggressive
appetite,” Nkeangnyi Laurence, a ministry delegate for Manyu
said by phone today, in Mamfe, about 550 kilometers (342 miles)
outside of Yaounde, the capital. “This is certainly going to
affect production this season,” Laurence said.  Plants take a year to recuperate, James Mosima, vice
president of the Cameroon National Association of Cocoa and
Coffee Producers, said in a phone interview from his cocoa farm
in Konye. “We are happy the attack has subsided,” he said,
adding pesticides had also helped.  Mosima and Laurence said several hectares of cocoa had been
destroyed by the caterpillar attacks and declined to give a more
specific estimate.  About 240,000 metric tons of cocoa was produced in the
Central African nation in 2010-11, with the southwest region
contributing 60 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
