The  European Central Bank  decreased
its government bond purchases last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it settled 63 million euros
($83 million) of bond purchases in the week through Jan. 27,
down from 2.2 billion euros the previous week and the lowest
amount in a month. The ECB will take seven-day term deposits
tomorrow to absorb the 219 billion euros of liquidity created
since its Securities Markets Program started in May 2010, a
practice it employs to ensure the purchases don’t fuel
inflation.  The ECB’s unlimited three-year loans made in December have
helped stabilize sentiment among bond investors in the euro
area, helping yields to drop. European nations including Italy,
Belgium and  Spain  may sell more than 33 billion euros of
securities this week as credit-rating cuts risk upending
optimism the region’s debt crisis is being contained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
