HEI Hospitality LLC, a closely held
lodging investment and management company, is in talks to buy
the upscale  Hotel Palomar Arlington  for about $45 million,
according to a person with knowledge of the deal.  An agreement for the $292,200-a-room purchase is likely to
be completed soon, said the person, who asked not to be named
because the discussions are private.  The hotel, located near  Washington , is owned by  JBG Cos. , a
 Chevy Chase , Maryland-based developer. The property is run by
Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group LLC, the San Francisco-based
operator of 52 boutique hotels and 56 restaurants in the U.S.
HEI owns 42 high-end properties with such brands the Le
Meridien, Crowne Plaza and Westin.  Occupancy at Washington-area hotels was little changed at
about 69 percent last year through November, according to
Hendersonville, Tennessee-based STR Global. That compares with a
68 percent occupancy for hotels in the top 25 U.S. markets, up
from 65 percent a year earlier.  “Over the long term, Washington is a good market with not
much new supply coming in,” said  Patrick Scholes , a New York-
based analyst at FBR Capital Markets. “In the immediate term,
the region has been one of the softest markets because of
government-austerity measures and a decline in spending.”  Anthony Rutledge, a spokesman for Norwalk, Connecticut-
based HEI, and Aimee Grove, a Kimpton spokeswoman, declined to
comment. Matt Blocher, a spokesman for JBG, didn’t immediately
return a telephone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
