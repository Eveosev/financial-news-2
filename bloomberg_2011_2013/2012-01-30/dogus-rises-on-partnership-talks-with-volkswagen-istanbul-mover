Dogus Otomotiv Servis & Ticaret AS ,
the Turkish importer of  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  cars, climbed on
speculation the company may partner Volkswagen in setting up a
production unit in  Turkey  after Hurriyet newspaper reported the
German automaker is considering such a plan.  Istanbul-based Dogus gained 4.3 percent to 3.67 liras at
the close in Istanbul after rising as much as 6.8 percent. The
report was based on Volkswagen’s internal technical evaluations
regarding production in Turkey and the two companies “have not
met to discuss an agreement for production in Turkey,”
according to a statement from Dogus today.  Volkswagen will publish a preliminary report in March and a
possible production plant would have an annual capacity of at
least 250,000 units, producing more than one model, Dogus
Otomotiv Chairman Aclan Acar said, according to the Hurriyet
article.  Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen, the producer of Jettas
and Golfs, also owns Audi, Seat and Skoda and aims to become the
world’s biggest carmaker by 2018. Volkswagen did not immediately
return two calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
