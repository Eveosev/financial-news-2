Gold declined from a seven-week high
in New York as the dollar gained after  Greece  signaled
opposition to economic oversight in exchange for aid, lowering
demand for the precious metal as an alternative investment.  European leaders won’t finalize Greece’s second aid program
today because talks with banks over debt reduction aren’t
completed, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said. Greek Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos yesterday rejected a reported plan
to appoint a supervisory commissioner, citing “national
dignity.” The dollar gained as much as 0.7 percent against a
basket of six currencies.  “People are in a risk-off mode today,” Rick Trotman, a
senior research analyst at MLV & Co. in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “The dollar’s strength is acting against
gold.”  Gold futures for April delivery fell 0.1 percent to settle
at $1,734.40 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
declining for the first time in four sessions. Bullion touched
$1,743 on Jan. 27, the highest since Dec. 8.  Prices have climbed 11 percent this month, exceeding the 10
percent gain in 2011.  Gold demand in  India , the world’s biggest bullion user, may
be “very low” in January because of higher prices and the
volatile local currency, the Bombay Bullion Association said.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$33.527 an ounce, after jumping to $34.015, the highest since
Nov. 16. The metal has gained 20 percent this month and is the
best performer this year among the 24 commodities tracked by the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery declined 0.4 percent to $1,616.30 an ounce,
retreating for the first time in four sessions. Palladium
futures for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to $688.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
