UBS AG (UBSN) , which sold its Brazilian
lending unit in 2009, is trying to buy another as it steps up
efforts to restart an investment-banking business in the
country, a person familiar with the company’s plans said.  UBS has sought a license for the past two years to open its
own business trading stocks and bonds, investing proprietary
funds, and offering derivatives and syndicated loans, according
to the person, who asked not to be named because the firm’s
strategy is private. Regulators haven’t granted permission as
they try to spur larger banks to purchase smaller ones with
existing licenses instead.  The Swiss company sold its Pactual bank unit to billionaire
 Andre Esteves , the former head of the business, for $2.5 billion
in 2009, less than three years after buying it. It still has a
private bank and a mergers-and-acquisitions business in  Brazil ,
with more than 200 workers.  UBS,  Switzerland ’s biggest lender, agreed in April 2010 to
buy Brazil brokerage Link Investimentos, and still hasn’t
received approval from the central bank for the deal, according
to the person, who declined to name potential bank acquisition
targets.  “There could be newcomers seeing an acquisition as a way
to speed up the process of entering the market,” Anthero Meirelles, the central bank director, said in an interview in
May.  A spokesman for UBS declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
