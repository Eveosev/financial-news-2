A measure of banks’ reluctance to
lend to one another in  Europe  held near the lowest level in
three months, money markets show.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight index swaps, was little
changed at 78 basis points. That’s the lowest since Oct. 27 and
compares with 97.4 at the start of the year.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 73 basis
points below Euribor at 9 a.m. in  London , little changed from
Jan. 27, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The cost has declined
every week since the start of the year when the measure was
minus 114.  The one-year basis swap was 64 basis points less than
Euribor from minus 62 on Jan. 27. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Overnight deposits  at the  European Central Bank  rose for
the first time in five days as banks parked 489 billion euros
($643 billion) at the Frankfurt-based ECB on Jan. 27 from 465
billion euros the previous day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
