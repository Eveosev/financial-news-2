The U.K. Financial Services
Authority appointed Will Samuel, who was most recently Lazard &
Co. U.K. vice-chairman, as investment banking adviser, the
regulator said today.  Samuel, who is currently a senior adviser at Lazard, will
advise the U.K.’s financial watchdog on investment banking
matters. He has worked at Schroders Plc and Citigroup Inc.,
becoming Lazard vice-chairman in 2003.  “Will brings to his role considerable experience of the
investment banking sector which will be vital to our work in
this area,”  Hector Sants , the FSA’s chief executive officer,
said in an e-mailed statement.  The FSA will be disbanded next year as part of the U.K.
government’s plans to hand responsibility for banking
supervision to the  Bank of England . Oversight of trading and
consumer rules will be taken over by the Financial Conduct
Authority.  Samuel is also chairman of Ecclesiastical Insurance Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
