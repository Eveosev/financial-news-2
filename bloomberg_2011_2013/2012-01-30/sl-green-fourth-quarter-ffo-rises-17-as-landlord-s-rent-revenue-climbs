SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG) , the biggest
owner of Manhattan skyscrapers, said fourth-quarter funds from
operations rose 17 percent as rent revenue increased.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, was $90.3 million, or $1.02 a share, compared with $77.4
million, or 97 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based real
estate investment trust said today in a statement. Analysts
expected FFO of $1 a share, the average of 18 estimates in a
Bloomberg  survey.   SL Green in the last two years has acquired “an eclectic
mix” of  Manhattan  (COLA) real estate including stakes in office,
retail and multifamily properties, according to  James Sullivan ,
a Cowen & Co. analyst in  New York . While there are re-leasing
and redevelopment risks, the investments have been mostly
positive and should continue to generate income, he said.  “It is this ‘latent’ earnings power that sets Green
apart,” Sullivan wrote in a Jan. 20 report in which he raised
his  rating  on the REIT to “outperform” from “neutral.”  Sullivan cited SL Green’s retail partnerships with Jeff
Sutton’s Wharton Properties, including 717 Fifth Ave., 747
Madison Ave. and 1552-1560 Broadway in the Times Square area, a
magnet for tourists.  SL Green bought a stake last year in 3 Columbus Circle, a
26-story tower near Central Park, protecting owner Joseph Moinian from a takeover bid by a creditor. In December, the
marketing firm Young & Rubicam Group agreed to become the
building’s anchor occupant.  Revenue, Leasing  Revenue rose 25 percent from a year earlier to $328.9
million, with revenue from rents increasing 26 percent. The
company said it signed 662,450 square feet (61,540 square
meters) of Manhattan leases in the quarter, with the new rents
12 percent higher than the previous fees on the same space.  Earnings were announced after the close of regular U.S.
trading. SL Green fell 1.7 percent to $72.75 today in New York.
The shares lost 1.3 percent in 2011, compared with a 3.9 percent
decline in the  Bloomberg REIT Office Property Index. (BBREOFPY)   SL Green had ownership interests in 27 million square feet
of Manhattan properties at the end of the quarter, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
