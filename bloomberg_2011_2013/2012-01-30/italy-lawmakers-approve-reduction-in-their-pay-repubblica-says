Lawmakers in  Italy â€™s Chamber of
Deputies will see their gross salaries cut by 1,300 euros
($1,700) a month, la Repubblica reported, citing Chamber Deputy
Speaker Rocco Buttiglione.  The measure was approved today by the presidency of the
lower house and will take effect immediately, the newspaper
cited Buttiglione as saying. Lawmakers who hold another post,
such as the speaker or his deputy, will see their monthly pay
cut by a further 10 percent, Buttiglione said, according to la
Repubblica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
