Women’s Professional Soccer ,  the
one-time home of U.S. players Abby Wambach, Hope Solo and
Christie Rampone, called off its season as it fights a legal
battle with a former team owner.  The league plans to return next year, according to a
statement on its website.  The league’s board voted today to end the season as it
continues with a lawsuit filed by former South Florida franchise
owner Dan Borislow. The legal issues “diverted resources from
investment in the league,” the league said in its statement.  The league began play in 2009 and was scheduled to start
its 2012 season in April with five teams.  Borislow’s South Florida franchise was kicked out of the
league in October after repeated clashes with WPS management
over the owner’s treatment of players and his payment of bills.
A Florida judge ruled this month that the league failed to
follow its own procedures when terminating the franchise.
Another court hearing is set for Feb. 1, according to the
 Associated Press .  The U.S. women’s national team beat Canada 4-0 yesterday to
win its Olympic qualifying group. Wambach, Solo and Rampone, all
members of the U.S. team that won a silver medal in the 2011
 World Cup , were no longer under contract with a WPS team,
according to  USA Today .  To contact the reporter on this story:
