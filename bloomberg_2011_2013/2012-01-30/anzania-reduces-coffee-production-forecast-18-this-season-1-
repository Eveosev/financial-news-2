Tanzania  cut its coffee production
forecast for the 2011-12 season 18 percent after a drought
reduced yields, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  Production for this marketing season, which started on July
1 and ends on June 30, may fall to 37,000 metric tons from an
earlier forecast of 45,000 tons, Adolph Kumburu, the board’s
director general, said by phone today from Moshi, northern
Tanzania. The revised forecast is 34 percent lower than 56,247
tons produced in the 2010-11 season, according to the board.  “We have revised our forecast because we realized less
than our anticipated output by the end of December,” he said.
“The Northern region and Kagera in the northwest were affected
by a drought last year.”  East Africa  was hit by the worst regional drought in six
decades last year, cutting farm production.  Harvesting for the season closed in most growing areas
except the high-altitude northern zone, and in the Mbinga and
Mbeya areas in the south, he said.      Tanzania, which consumes less than 3 percent of its annual
output, according to the Eastern African Fine Coffee
Association, reaps the crop from April through August, while its
marketing season runs July through June while sales normally
close in April or May.  The nation grows both the robusta and arabica varieties in
the western Kagera region, while the northern Kilimanjaro and
southern regions mainly produce arabica.  Arabica accounts for about 75 percent of output, with
robusta making up the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
