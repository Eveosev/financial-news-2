Vietnam ’s government bonds fell,
pushing benchmark five-year yields up by the most this year, on
speculation banks are short of cash after the week-long Lunar
New Year, or Tet, holidays. The dong was steady.  “Banks often face with fund shortages after Tet, because
demand for cash soars during the holiday,” said Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based Ocean Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank. “Not many banks have money to buy bonds
now.”  The  yield  on the five-year note gained five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 12.42 percent from Jan. 20,
according to daily fixing prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. That was the biggest increase since Dec. 23.  The dong was little changed at 20,890 per dollar from Jan.
20 as of 5:14 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. Vietnamese financial markets were closed
from Jan. 23 to Jan. 27.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828 per
dollar, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
