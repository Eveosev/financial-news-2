Denmark’s Socialist People’s Party,
part of the ruling coalition, opposes a sale of the country’s
stake in airline  SAS Group (SAS) , seeking to defend Copenhagen
airport’s regional hub status.  “If others think SAS can be a good business, why should we
not make that money ourselves?”  Anne Baastrup , the party’s
traffic chairwoman, said by telephone Jan. 27, adding that there
are currently no talks with potential suitors for Denmark’s
stake.  Denmark holds 14.3 percent of SAS  shares , the same amount
as neighbor  Norway , while Sweden has 21.4 percent of the stock,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
