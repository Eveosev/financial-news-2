The number of U.K. students applying
for undergraduate university courses fell 8.7 percent this year
after colleges were allowed to increase fees as part of the
government’s plan to narrow the  budget deficit .  Applications from U.K.-domiciled students  by the Jan. 15
deadline declined to 462,507 from 506,388 a year earlier,
Cheltenham, western England-based UCAS, which manages the
process of allocating places in higher education, said on its
website today. The proportion of 18-year-olds in  England 
applying for courses fell by about 1 percentage point, after
rising annually since 2006. Application rates in  Scotland ,  Wales 
and  Northern Ireland  were little changed.  English universities are allowed to charge fees of as much
as 9,000 pounds ($14,100) a year from October 2012. Fees were
capped at 3,375 pounds before a House of Commons vote in
December 2010 approving the change that sparked protests in the
streets of central  London .  “Our analysis shows that decreases in demand are slightly
larger in more advantaged groups than in the disadvantaged
groups,” UCAS Chief Executive Mary Curnock Cook said in a
 statement . “Widely expressed concerns about recent changes in
HE funding arrangements having a disproportionate effect on more
disadvantaged groups are not borne out by these data.”  Total applications, including foreign students, dropped 7.4
percent, with a 13.7 percent increase in the number of people
from outside the European Union seeking to study in Britain.  Even so, the indications are that demand for university
places will outstrip supply this year, Curnock Cook said.
“Applications are already 50,000 ahead of the number of
acceptances in 2011, and last year UCAS received over 100,000
further applications” between the January deadline and the
start of courses in the fall, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
