Rice exports from  Vietnam , the
world’s second-largest shipper after  Thailand , may total 400,000
metric tons this month, 25 percent less than a year earlier,
according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.  While export prices “fell slightly” from December,
Vietnamese companies haven’t signed many contracts because the
nation’s prices are higher than those of other exporters like
India and  Pakistan , the ministry said in a monthly  report .  Vietnam may export about 1.1 million tons in the first
quarter, compared with more than 1.8 million tons in the same
period last year, Thoi Bao Kinh Te Vietnam newspaper said today,
citing the Vietnam Food Association.  Shipments may total 3 million to 3.5 million tons in the
first half and 3.5 million tons in the second half, according to
a  statement  on the government’s website, citing the association.
Full-year exports are forecast at 6.5 million to 7 million tons,
with 1 million to 1.5 million tons of stockpiles to be carried
over to 2013, according to the statement, posted yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
