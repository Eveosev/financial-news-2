Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT) , a South African
industrial holding company, said fiscal first-half profit
increased as much as 33 percent, boosted by the sale of part of
its stake in an airport in  India .  Per-share earnings increased by as much as 33 percent in
the six months through December, the Johannesburg-based company
said in a regulatory filing today. Earnings excluding one-time
items climbed 35 percent to 40 percent, it said.  Bidvest on Aug. 23 said the sale of half of its interest in
the Mumbai International Airport Private Ltd. will lift profit
before one-time items by 400 million rand ($51 million). The
13.5 percent stake was sold to GVK Power & Infrastructure Ltd.
for $287 million.  Earnings for the fiscal first-half also include a 96.7
million rand impairment of the company’s investment in  Comair (COM) 
Ltd., the airline part-owned by  International Consolidated
Airlines Group SA (IAG) , Bidvest said. Shares in Comair, in which
Bidvest owns 26 percent, slid 32 percent over the period,
valuing the airline at 760 million rand.  The stock of Bidvest, which owns companies from grain-
handling to car retailing, has gained 10 percent over the past
12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
