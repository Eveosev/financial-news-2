Oslo’s District Court convicted two
men for plotting an act of terror against the Danish newspaper
that spurred outrage across much of the Muslim world for its
2005 caricatures of the prophet Muhammad.  Mikael Davud was sentenced to seven years in prison and
Sawad Sadek Saeed Bujak was handed a 3 1/2-year jail term for
planning terror acts, Judge Oddmund Svarteberg said in a live
broadcast of the verdict. A third man, David Jakobsen, was
acquitted of terror charges and given four months and time
served for helping to procure explosive materials.  The convictions were the first to fall under  Norway ’s
terror act, which came into effect in 2002, according to
broadcaster NRK. The three men were apprehended in July 2010 by
the Norwegian Policy Security Service for having suspected ties
to al-Qaeda.  Jyllands-Posten,  Denmark ’s biggest newspaper, has been the
target of several terrorist threats since it published the
Muhammad drawings in 2005. The cartoons also sparked global
protests in which demonstrators in  Muslim countries  including
 Syria  torched Danish embassies.  Davud, a Uighur originally from  China , arrived in Norway in
1999 and became a citizen in 2007. The Uighurs are a Chinese
ethnic minority from the predominantly Muslim region of
Xinjiang. Bujak, an Iraqi Kurd, came to Norway in the late 1990s
and was granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds.
Jakobsen is an ethnic Uzbek and also holds permanent residence.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
