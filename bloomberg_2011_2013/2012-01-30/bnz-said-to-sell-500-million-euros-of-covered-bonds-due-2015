BNZ International Funding Ltd. plans
to sell 500 million euros of  New Zealand  covered bonds,
according to a banker involved in the transaction.  The notes due May 2015 may be priced to yield about 125
basis points more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, according to
the banker. DZ Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., NAB, Natixis,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are managing
the sale, the banker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
