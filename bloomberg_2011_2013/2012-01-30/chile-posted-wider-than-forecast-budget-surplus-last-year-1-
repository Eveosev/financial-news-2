Chile  posted a fiscal surplus
equivalent to 1.4 percent of gross domestic product last year,
exceeding state forecasts as revenue soared 12 percent from
2010, the budget office said.  Fiscal spending grew 3.2 percent over the same period, the
office said in a report handed out in Santiago today. The
government last year forecast a budget surplus of 1.2 percent of
GDP for 2011.  The Andean nation’s social and economic stabilization fund
held $13.2 billion at the end of 2011, and the pension reserve
fund had $4.4 billion, the office said. The government will tap
its stabilization fund this year to stimulate growth if the
European sovereign-debt crisis causes the Andean nation’s
economy to deteriorate, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain told
reporters in October.  “We have a pretty comfortable position to face challenges
in 2012,” Budget Director Rosanna Costa told reporters in
Santiago today.  Chile’s economy may grow about 4 percent this year after
expanding as much as 6.3 percent in 2011, Larrain told CNN Chile
in an interview last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
