Iran  will generate $57 billion from
oil exports in the next Iranian calendar year if the country
achieves an average sales price for its crude of $85 a barrel,
the state-run  Mehr  news agency said, without citing anyone.  Mehr gave no comparative revenue figure in yesterday’s
report for the current Iranian year ending March 19. The
government’s budget for the next year will probably be based on
an average oil price of $85, according to the report.  Iran is the second-biggest producer in OPEC after  Saudi
Arabia , pumping 3.575 million barrels a day of crude in
December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Spot prices
for Iran’s main export grades currently average more than $100 a
barrel, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
