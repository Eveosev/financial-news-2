Half of Icelanders want the country
to complete European Union accession talks, a poll by the
University of Iceland’s Social Science Research Institute
 published  by RUV showed.  Voter support for continuing the process and putting EU
membership to a referendum was 50 percent, the Reykjavik-based
broadcaster said late yesterday. The poll showed that 37.9
percent want to withdraw the membership bid, while a 12.1
percent didn’t want to comment on their position.  Iceland started EU entry talks in July 2010 and will likely
vote on accession in early 2013. Of a total of 35 negotiating
chapters for EU accession, Iceland has opened 11 and completed
eight, the EU said in December. The primary challenges facing
the talks are in matters relating to agriculture, environment
and fisheries, according to EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule.  The  institute  polled 1,198 people and had 97.9 percent
response rate. The margin of error was 0.95 percent to 1.46
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
