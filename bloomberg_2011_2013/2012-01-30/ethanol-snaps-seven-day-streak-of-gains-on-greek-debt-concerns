Ethanol futures snapped a seven-day
winning streak on concern  Greece ’s bailout negotiations will
falter and slow fuel demand.  Futures followed crude oil and gasoline lower as Greece
resisted calls from  Germany  for a European overseer to head its
budget. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to augment supply as
part of U.S. energy plans to reduce fossil fuel use.  “That’s the big financial sword of Damocles hanging over
our market,” said Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk
Management Inc. in  Dallas . “I’m very worried about this and so
is the rest of the market.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery fell 3.1 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.166 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the first decline since Jan. 18 and the steepest drop since Jan.
13. Prices have fallen 1.7 percent this month and are heading
for the third monthly slump.  In cash market trading ethanol in the U.S. Gulf sank 5
cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.22 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive decreased 4.5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.12,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast fell 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$2.245 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel decreased 2.5 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.245.  Crude for March delivery fell 78 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at $98.78 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices are down 5 cents this month.  Gasoline for February delivery fell 5.61 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $2.8707 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
