An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the
Richter scale struck  Peru ’s southern coast at about midnight
local time, leaving at least 119 people injured.  The temblor knocked out power temporarily and damaged
buildings near the epicenter in Ica, about 270 kilometers (168
miles) south of capital  Lima , Peru’s civil defense authority
said in an e-mailed statement.  The quake shook buildings in Lima and was felt in cities in
the southern highlands and along Peru’s northern coast. In Ica,
people remained outside their homes for the rest of the night
fearing aftershocks,  Radio Programas  reported. Residents in the
port of Pisco concerned the quake might trigger a  tsunami  fled
to higher ground. No tsunami alert has been issued, said Soledad
Arevalo, a civil defense authority spokeswoman, in a phone
interview from Lima.  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , Peru’s largest producer of the
metal, didn’t sustain any damage at its mines or smelter, said a
company official briefed on the matter, declining to be named
because of company policy. Pluspetrol SA said its Camisea
natural gas plant in the coastal port of Pisco is operating
normally.  Peru is the world’s third largest copper and zinc producer
and sixth largest in gold.  The earthquake hit at 12:10 a.m. local time at a depth of
54 kilometers, according to the Peruvian Geophysical Institute’s
website. It was followed by a magnitude 4 aftershock nine hours
later.  The area was devastated by a magnitude-8 quake in 2007,
Peru’s worst in more than 30 years, killing at least 510 people
and leaving another 80,000 homeless.  The  Lima General Index (IGBVL)  of stocks retreated 0.2 percent to
21,806.91 at 11:58 a.m. local time. The Peruvian sol was little
changed at 2.6910 per  U.S. dollar , according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
