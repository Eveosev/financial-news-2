U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lower for a third day, as European
leaders sparred with Greece over a second rescue program.  Equities  pared  declines as some of the biggest technology
companies rallied.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  added at least
1.2 percent.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  fell 3 percent after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. cut its recommendation.  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  and
Chesapeake Energy Corp. dropped more than 1.1 percent as oil
slumped.  Gannett Co. (GCI) , the owner of 82 newspapers including  USA
Today , tumbled 6.9 percent as its profit plunged  33 percent .  The S&P 500 decreased 0.3 percent to 1,313.01 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time. The benchmark index for American equities trimmed a
decline of as much as 1.2 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  retreated 6.74 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,653.72.  “The low hanging fruit has been picked and now it’s a more
difficult slog to get substantive changes in  Europe ,” said
Kevin Caron, a market strategist in Florham Park,  New Jersey , at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co, which has more than $107 billion in client
assets. “There are near term doubts over the willingness of
 Greece  and perhaps other countries to accept fiscal reforms.
Anything that could interrupt further progress in the euro area
could be met with an opportunity for traders to sell.”  Today’s decline follows a four-week rally in the S&P 500,
which was driven by the  Federal Reserve ’s plans to keep  interest
rates  low through at least late 2014 and better-than-estimated
earnings. Of the 171 S&P 500 companies that reported results
since Jan. 9, 113 posted per-share earnings that beat
projections, Bloomberg data show.  ‘National Dignity’  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos rejected reports
of plans to appoint a European Union commissioner to oversee the
nation’s budget, citing “national dignity.” French President
Nicolas Sarkozysaid Greek debt-swap talks with private
bondholders are “going in the right direction” and the issue
should be settled in the next few days.  “The question isn’t whether or not Europe goes into a
recession, but how deep that recession is going to be,” Tom Wirth, who helps manage $1.5 billion as senior investment
officer for Chemung Canal Trust Co., in Elmira, New York, said
in a telephone interview. “Greece as it stands currently is
untenable. The market is getting comfortable with some sort of
Greek default, whether it’s orderly or disorderly.”  Financial shares had the biggest decline in the S&P 500
among 10 industries, falling 1 percent as a group.  Bank of
America  dropped 3 percent to $7.07 after Goldman Sachs cut its
recommendation for the shares to “neutral” from “buy.”  Energy Stocks  A measure of energy shares in the S&P 500 retreated 0.4
percent. Halliburton slumped 1.2 percent to $36.67. Chesapeake
decreased 1.6 percent to $21.69.  Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR)  gained 3.5 percent, the most in the
S&P 500, to $18.56. Traders in the options market are betting
the world’s largest land-drilling contractor may be a takeover
candidate after the departure of its 81-year-old chief executive
officer. In the past two weeks,  calls  priced 10 percent above
Nabors’ stock rose the most in 18 months versus puts on one-
month contracts, signaling traders are anticipating an
acquisition, said JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC.  Gannett tumbled 6.9 percent to $14.17. Revenue from the
publishing division, the  largest  unit, declined 5.3 percent as
advertising and circulation fell. The newspaper industry overall
has continued to lose ad business to Internet companies such as
Google Inc. and Facebook Inc.   Staples Inc. (SPLS)  declined 4.9 percent to $15.23. The world’s
largest office products company was  cut  to “sell” from
“neutral” by Goldman Sachs, which cited a “tough” outlook
for the global printing segment.  Apple Rallies  Measures of telephone and technology companies in the S&P
500 rallied. Apple added 1.3 percent to $453.01. Microsoft
gained 1.3 percent to $29.61.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  rose
1.1 percent to $37.61.  Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe & Jack  surged 24 percent to $14.93
after agreeing to go private in an acquisition by Gores Group
LLC valued at about $791 million. The cash offer of $15 a share
is 24 percent higher than Pep Boys’ closing price on Jan. 27,
the companies said today in a statement.  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  rallied 4.2 percent to $8.52.  Delta
Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  is studying a bid as North American carriers
assess possible combinations after the bankruptcy of American
Airlines parent AMR Corp., people familiar with the matter said.  Valuations (SPX)  for U.S. equities have been stuck below the
five-decade average for the longest period since Richard Nixon’s
presidency, a sign investors don’t trust earnings even after a
three-year bull market.  Record Profits  Analysts  estimate profits  in the S&P 500 will reach a
record $104.78 this year after increasing 125 percent since the
end of 2009, the fastest expansion in a quarter century,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. American companies are
boosting income so much that even after stocks doubled, the  S&P
500  hasn’t traded above its 16.4 mean ratio for 446 days, the
longest stretch since the 13 years beginning in 1973.  Battered by the 14 percent decline in the S&P 500 since
2000, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and
the flash crash 21 months ago, investors are staying away from
stocks, even after record profits, 10 quarters of  U.S. economic
growth  and promises by the Federal Reserve to keep interest
rates near zero through 2014. Of the $37 trillion erased from
global equities in the credit crisis, $24 trillion has been
restored.  “After two significant bear markets, the flash crash and
the lost decade, many have simply said, ‘No mas,’” Howard Ward,
who helps oversee $35 billion at Gamco Investors Inc. in Rye,
New York, said in an e-mail on Jan. 24. “Of course, bull
markets have a history of climbing a wall of worry. And it is
happening again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
