Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. (UCSP) , Kenya’s
only publicly traded retail chain, said profit in the first half
of its financial year rose 26 percent.  Pretax income for the six months through December climbed
to 204.3 million shillings ($2.4 million) compared with 162.2
million shillings a year earlier, while sales jumped to 7.5
billion shillings from 5.8 billion shillings, the company said
in a statement distributed by e-mail by the Nairobi Securities
Exchange today.  The company’s shares gained the  most in a week , rising 0.7
percent to 7.50 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital,
Nairobi.  Uchumi resumed trading on the Kenyan bourse on May 31 after
being suspended when it went into receivership in June 2006 with
debts of 2.2 billion shillings, of which 957 million shillings
was owed to  Kenya  Commercial Bank Ltd. and PTA Bank Ltd. The
company emerged from receivership in March 2010, after most of
its debts were cleared and others converted into shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
