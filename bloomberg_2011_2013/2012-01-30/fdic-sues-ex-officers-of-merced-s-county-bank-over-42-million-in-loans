The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
sued former officials of County Bank in Merced, California, part
of  Capital Corp. of the West , claiming their mismanagement
caused $42 million in losses through bad loans.  Named in the suit, filed Jan. 27 in federal court in
Fresno, were former County Bank Chief Executive Officer Thomas T. Hawker; John J. Incandela, Dave Kraechan, and Edwin Jay Lee,
who are former vice presidents; and Edward Rocha, the former
chief operating officer and bank president.  “Defendants caused or allowed County to make imprudent
real estate loans,” the FDIC said in the complaint.  The bank, which was established in 1977 and provided
residential construction loans in California’s central valley,
failed in 2009, according to the complaint. The FDIC is receiver
for the bank.  “Management repeatedly disregarded the bank’s credit
policies and approved loans to borrowers who were not credit
worthy” or lacked sufficient collateral, the FDIC alleged.  The former officers either had no phone number listed or
had an unlisted number, and couldn’t immediately be located for
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is FDIC v. Hawker, 12-CV-00127, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of  California  (Fresno).  To contact the reporter on this story:
