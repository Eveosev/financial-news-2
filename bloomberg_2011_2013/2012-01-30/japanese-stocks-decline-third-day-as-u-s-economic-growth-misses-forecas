Japanese  stocks  fell for a third day,
the biggest drop in two weeks, after the  U.S. economy  expanded
less than forecast, dimming the earnings outlook for Asian
exporters of cars and electronics.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on the U.S. for a fifth of its
sales, fell 1.8 percent after the yen gained against the dollar.
Nippon Electric Glass Co. tumbled 10 percent after saying profit
may fall by more than half.  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  dropped
the most on the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  after the government
barred it from state contracts.  “The U.S. GDP wasn’t very strong and the yen strengthened
against the dollar, so the market should weaken a little,” said
 Kiyoshi Ishigane  a Tokyo-based strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co. which oversees　about $84 billion. “Stocks
have been rising since the middle of this month and now
investors may want to sell to lock in profit.”  The  Nikkei 225  fell 0.5 percent to 8,793.05 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , the biggest drop since Jan. 16. The broader
 Topix (MXAP)  Index lost 0.5 percent to 757.01. The 25-day  Toraku (TORAKU)  index,
a technical indicator of market momentum, exceeded 120 for a
third day, suggesting the market may be poised to fall.  The Topix has advanced 3.9 percent this year, rebounding
from last year’s 19 percent drop, amid signs the U.S. economy is
improving. Shares on the index trade for an average of 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.2 times for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index. A number less than one means that companies can be
bought for less than value of their assets  U.S. GDP  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  slipped 0.5 percent today. The
gauge lost 0.2 percent in  New York  on Jan. 27 after a report
showed U.S. gross domestic product, the value of all goods and
services produced, expanded less than analysts forecast.  The world’s biggest economy grew at a 2.8 percent
annualized rate in the three months through December, compared
with a forecast for a 3 percent increase.  More than a third of the Topix’s 1,660’s companies are
scheduled to report earnings this week. Of the 296 that have
 posted  net income for the latest quarter so far this year, 38
have exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 40 have fallen short,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Exporters declined after the dollar fell to as low as 76.65
yen today in Tokyo, compared with 77.05 at the close of  stock
trading  on Jan. 27. Sony lost 1.8 percent to 1,388 yen.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) , a carmaker that gets almost 30 percent of its sales
from the U.S., lost 1.7 percent to 2,789 yen.  Greek Debt Deal  European Union leaders gather today in Brussels for their
first summit of 2012 where they will put the finishing touches
on a German-led deficit-control treaty and endorse a 500
billion-euro ($661 billion) rescue fund to be set up this year.  Greece  and its private creditors said Jan. 28 they expect
to complete a deal in coming days after bondholders signaled
they would accept European government demands for a bigger cut
in their debt holdings.  Glass makers  fell the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups. Nippon Electric Glass tumbled 10 percent to 670 yen
after saying profit may fall by at least 54 percent to 31.5
billion yen ($410 million) for this fiscal year on slumping
demand for glass used in TVs and cameras. Asahi Glass Co. sank
3.4 percent to 627 yen.  Mitsubishi Electric plunged 15 percent to 650 yen after
 Japan  barred it from bidding on projects until it refunds the
government for overcharges. The company, which makes satellites
equipment and electronics, last week said it billed the
government too much on aerospace and defense contracts.  Shipping companies also declined after the Nikkei newspaper
reported Japan’s three largest lines may post pretax losses for
the year ending March amid plunging cargo rates. Nippon Yusen
K.K., the country’s biggest shipper, slipped 2.1 percent to 191
yen. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. lost 2.1 percent to 285 yen.  Advantest Corp. (6857)  advanced the most on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  after
saying it plans to raise its full-year dividend to 15 yen per
share from 10 yen a year earlier. The world’s biggest maker of
memory-chip testers also got a boost after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
lifted its target price to 700 yen from 650 yen. Advantest
soared 12 percent to 817 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
