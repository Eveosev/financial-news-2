Ukrainian economic growth eased in
the fourth quarter of 2011 as industrial production slowed
because of weaker demand for the country’s products on world
markets, the state statistics committee said.  Gross domestic product  expanded a preliminary 4.6 percent
from a year ago, compared with 6.6 percent in the previous
three-month period, the statistics committee, based in the
capital Kiev, said today on its website. The result exceeded the
4.5 percent median estimate of three economists in a  Bloomberg (UACPTYOY) 
survey.  Growth accelerated a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent from
the previous three-month period, the statistics office said,
without providing any additional data. Ukraine’s economy grew
5.2 percent in all of 2011, the fastest pace since 2007, spurred
by a good harvest and increased exports, the office said. That
compares with a 4.2 percent gain in 2010 and a 3.9 percent
forecast by the government for 2012.  “The second half of 2011 was stronger than analysts
expected because of a good harvest,” said Alexander Valchyshen,
the head of research at Investment Capital Ukraine in Kiev.
Valchyshen sees growth of 3.5 percent for this year and doesn’t
plan to revise it at the moment.  Ukraine’s government bonds due to mature in 2016 rose,
pushing yields down to 9.6 percent, the lowest level since Dec.
