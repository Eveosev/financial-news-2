Banco Bradesco SA and Itau Unibanco
Holding SA, Brazil’s largest private banks, declined after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. scrapped an “overweight” rating on the
stocks.  Bradesco fell 2.5 percent to 32.12 reais at 1:21 p.m in Sao
Paulo, while Itau lost 2.8 percent, the most since Nov. 17, to
35.11 reais. The  MSCI Brazil (MXBR) /Financials Index was down 2.6
percent, the  worst  performance among 10 industry groups.  The banks were cut to “neutral” from “overweight” by
JPMorgan equity analyst  Saul Martinez , according to a note sent
to clients today. “Investors should rotate out of these
stocks” and select Banco do Brasil SA and smaller banks such as
Banco do Estado do  Rio Grande  do Sul SA, he wrote in the note.
“The ample valuation rerating story for Itau and Bradesco has
mostly run its course.”  Brazil’s central bank has cut borrowing costs for four
straight meetings since Aug. 31 to stimulate growth in the
world’s sixth-largest economy. Since then, Bradesco gained 14
percent while Itau was up 22 percent.  Banco do Brasil dropped 0.6 percent today to 26.88 reais,
and has gained 0.6 percent since the central bank began its
monetary easing cycle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
