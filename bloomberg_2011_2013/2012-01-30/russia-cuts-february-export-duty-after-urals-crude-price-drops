Russia , the world’s biggest oil
producer, will cut its export duty on most crude shipments by 1
percent from Feb. 1 after prices fell.  The standard tax will drop to $393.70 a metric ton ($53.71
a barrel), according to a decree signed by Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  and published today in the government’s
Rossiyskaya Gazeta daily. That compares with $397.50 this month.  The discounted rate on some Eastern Siberian and offshore
oil will decline to $191.20 a ton from $194.10.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
Russia’s benchmark export blend averaged $108.23 a barrel during
the most recent monitoring period, according to the  Finance
Ministry , down from $109.09 in the previous period.  Starting in October, the government lowered the crude
export duty by applying a coefficient of 60 percent of the
average Urals price in its calculations, down from 65 percent,
and unified the tax on most refined products at 66 percent of
that levy.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products will
decline to $259.80 a ton next month.  A special gasoline tax that Putin imposed from May 1 to
fight domestic shortages will fall to $354.30 a ton.  The duty on liquefied petroleum gases, such as butane and
propane, will fall to $181.70 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
