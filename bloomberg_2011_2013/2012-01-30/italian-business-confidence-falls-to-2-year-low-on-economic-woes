Italian business confidence fell in
January to the lowest in more than two years as the economy
probably entered into a recession under the weight of austerity
measures to fight the sovereign debt crisis.  The manufacturing-sentiment index dropped to 92.1, the
lowest since November 2009, from 92.5 in December, Rome-based
national statistics institute Istat said today. Economists had
predicted a reading of 92.3, according to the median of 16
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  The mood among executives mirrors the pessimism of Italian
consumers as Prime Minister  Mario Monti  implements a 20 billion-
euro ($26 billion) package of spending cuts and tax increases to
eliminate the  budget deficit  and tame the debt. The euro-
region’s third-biggest economy shrank in the third quarter, with
the government forecasting a further contraction in the final
quarter of last year, meaning Italy may already be in its fourth
recession since 2001.  Fiat SpA may see its European sales decline by 500,000 cars
a year as fallout from the debt crisis hits growth and demand,
Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said earlier this
month.  Monti, who took office in November as head of an unelected
government of non-politicians, is seeking to show investors he
can tame  Italy ’s 1.9 trillion-euro debt, which is bigger than
that of Spain,  Greece , Portugal and Ireland combined.  Many are rejecting his calls for shared sacrifices now to
spur future prosperity. A wildcat strike by truck drivers last
week clogged traffic on Italian highways, forcing Fiat to halt
car production and leaving some cities short of gasoline and
food.
