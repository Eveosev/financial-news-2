Zodiac Aerospace (ZC)  is a long way from
reaching a “glass ceiling” beyond which acquisitions would no
longer make sense, Chief Executive Officer Olivier Zarrouati
told  Les Echos  in an interview.  The company’s development strategy includes looking for
acquisitions of “reasonable size” relative to Zodiac’s sales,
Zarrouati told the newspaper.  Clients don’t want suppliers who are bigger than them,
which places limits on acquisition strategy, Zarrouati said,
adding that Zodiac is a long way from reaching that point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
