Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil company, found traces of oil in an onshore
well in the POT-T-609 block of the country’s Potiguar Basin.  The discovery in well 1BRSA1038RN hasn’t yet been declared
commercially viable, according to a posting on the website of
Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency.  Petrobras last week said it discovered oil in the
1BRSA1034RN well in the same block.  To contact the reporter on this story:
