Greece  should be closely monitored
by the European Union if it won’t manage itself, German Economy
Minister Philipp Roesler said in an interview with  Bild  today.  Greece also shouldn’t receive any more aid until it
implements reforms, Roesler told the newspaper, adding that
 Germany  opposes adding money to the European Stability
Mechanism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
