HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA ,
 Brazil ’s fourth-largest oil company by market value, has enough
cash to cover investments through 2013 as it accelerates
exploration in the Amazon and off the coast of  Namibia .  HRT has started drilling a third well in the Solimoes Basin
in the Amazon and will approve its budget and drilling plan for
this year in two to three weeks, Chief Executive Officer Marcio Mello said in a telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro  today.
HRT, based in Rio, has about $400 million in cash now, he said.  “We are funded for the next two years,” Mello said. “We
are not going to the bank in 2013.”  TNK-BP,  Russia ’s third-largest oil producer, agreed in
October to pay $1 billion for a 45 percent stake in HRT’s
Solimoes block, with an option for an additional 10 percent.
Under an amendment dated Jan. 27, HRT will pay exploration
expenses incurred during 2011 and pay for the first $175 million
of investments this year.  As compensation, TNK-BP agreed to pay HRT $250 million when
it completes “milestones,” including an accumulated production
of 2.5 million barrels.  “It will be easy, these milestones are incentives for us
to speed up performance,” Mello said. “It didn’t change much,
they already gave me the money, the letter of credit is with
me.”  HRT rose 2.8 percent to close at 473 reais in  Sao Paulo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
