The ruble slid for a second day
against the dollar as  Europe ’s debt crisis reduced  oil prices 
and quelled appetite for riskier assets, while demand for the
Russian currency to pay local taxes declined.  The ruble weakened 0.5 percent to 30.4250 and 0.2 percent
to 39.88 against the euro by the close in Moscow. The currency
dropped 0.3 percent to 34.6797 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket, its sharpest decline since Jan. 13.  Crude for March delivery dropped for a second day,
retreating 0.8 percent to $98.81 a barrel in  New York , as
European leaders meet today to discuss the region’s debt crisis,
which has slowed the economy and threatened global fuel
consumption. The ruble had its longest winning streak in four
years versus the dollar through Jan. 26 as companies bought the
currency to pay local taxes and banks sought funds to repay
about $24 billion of Finance Ministry loans.  As well as an “overall retreat of risk-on attitudes,” the
ruble is sliding as demand to pay about 900 billion ($30
billion) in domestic taxes wanes and investors bet the
currency’s gains will spur central bank interventions to weaken
its advance,  Ivan Tchakarov , chief economist at  Renaissance
Capital  in Moscow, said today by e-mail.  “The central bank may now step in to limit further ruble
appreciation,” he said. “It has strengthened quite a lot since
the start of the year.”  Floating Corridor  Bank Rossii buys and sells international currencies to
manage the ruble within a floating corridor and against a basket
of about 55 percent dollars and 45 percent euros. An  exchange
rate  from 34.70 to 33.87 against the basket implies daily
interventions of as much as $150 million to weaken the ruble,
according to VTB Group’s estimates. The ruble closed at 34.5672
against the basket at the end of last week.  Investors increased bets the ruble would weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 30.8268
per dollar in three months.  Russia’s dollar Eurobond due in 2020 fell, lifting the
yield 0.04 percentage point to 4.355 percent. Domestic notes
maturing March 2018 were little changed with the yield rising
two basis points to 7.92 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
