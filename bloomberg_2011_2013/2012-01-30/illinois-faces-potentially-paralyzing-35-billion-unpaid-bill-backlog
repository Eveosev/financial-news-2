Illinois (STOIL1) ’s unpaid bills may more
than triple to $34.8 billion by 2017 unless lawmakers and
Democratic Governor  Pat Quinn  immediately bring Medicaid and
pension spending under control, said a research group.  The “potentially paralyzing” backlog, projected to reach
$9.2 billion when this fiscal year ends June 30, would be fueled
by an “unsustainable” increase in Medicaid spending, according
to the Civic Federation, which calls itself a nonpartisan
government research organization.  “Failure to address unsustainable trends in the state’s
pension and Medicaid systems will only result in financial
disaster for the state of  Illinois ,” Laurence Msall, president
of the Civic Federation in Chicago, said in a  press release 
today.  Illinois had its general-obligation bond rating reduced
Jan. 6 by Moody’s Investors Service to A2 from A1, making it the
company’s lowest-graded U.S. state. Moody’s revised its outlook
because the state “took no steps to implement lasting solutions
to its severe pension underfunding or to its chronic bill
payment delays.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
