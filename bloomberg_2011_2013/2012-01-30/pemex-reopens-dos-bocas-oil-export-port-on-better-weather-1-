Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned  oil company , reopened a
crude-export terminal in the  Gulf of Mexico  today after weather conditions improved.  The terminal at the port of Dos Bocas reopened as of this afternoon, Mexico’s Merchant
Marine said in a weather  bulletin  on its website.  Pemex, the third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S., exported about 1.3 million barrels of
crude a day in December. About 84 percent of Mexican crude exports are sold to the U.S.,
according to statistics from Mexico City-based Pemex. Canada is the largest supplier of crude to
the U.S followed by  Saudi Arabia .  Dos Bocas is Pemex’s third-largest export terminal behind Cayo Arcas and Coatzacoalcos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
