Brandon Marshall of the Miami
Dolphins had a record four touchdown receptions as the AFC beat
the NFC 59-41 in the  National Football League ’s Pro Bowl.  The American Football Conference scored four straight
second-half touchdowns to erase a 35-31 deficit at Aloha Stadium
in Honolulu, with Marshall catching two scoring passes from
Cincinnati Bengals rookie quarterback Andy Dalton. Marshall had
a team-leading six touchdown catches for the Dolphins during the
regular season.  “These guys were just putting it in the right places and I
was making the play,” Marshall, who was voted the game’s Most
Valuable Player, said in a televised interview. “This is my
playoffs. It’s fun.”  It was the highest-scoring game in Pro Bowl history and
leaves the series tied 21-21.  Larry Fitzgerald of the Arizona Cardinals caught three
touchdown passes for the  National Football Conference , including
one from Carolina Panthers rookie quarterback Cam Newton, who
was intercepted three times.  Dalton, Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers and
Philip Rivers of the San Diego Chargers each had two touchdown
passes for the AFC. Newton, Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints
and Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers each threw two
touchdown passes for the NFC.  The All-Star matchup was played the week before the  Super
Bowl  for the third straight year, meaning players selected from
the  New York Giants  and  New England Patriots  were unavailable.
The Giants and Patriots will meet in the Super Bowl on Feb. 5 in
Indianapolis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
