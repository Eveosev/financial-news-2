UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
agreed to lease a new purpose-built building in London’s main
financial district for about 18 years, confirming an accord
announced in August 2010.  Demolition of an existing building is under way at
Broadgate, adjacent to Liverpool Street railroad station, to
prepare the site for the new 700,000 square-foot (65,000 square
meters) office, developers and future landlords  British Land Co. (BLND) 
and  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  said in a statement today. UBS will use
5 Broadgate as its U.K. base.  Construction is scheduled to finish in the final quarter of
2014. UBS agreed to defer termination of its existing leases on
three buildings in or close to Broadgate, which are also owned
by the partners, by as much as three years to allow the fit-out
of the new building. This will generate 74 million pounds ($116
million) in additional rent, the development partners said in
the statement.  UBS will pay rent of 54.50 pounds a square foot, which will
be pegged to inflation. The bank has obtained an 18-month waiver
on rent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
