A shift in pricing of oil futures
may encourage traders to store cargoes at sea, boosting demand
for tankers, Morgan Stanley analysts said.  Brent crude oil for March is trading at 28 cents more than
April contracts on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
First month contracts were $1.49 more than second-month ones on
Dec. 15. When immediate prices fall below future ones, markets
are said to be in contango, a situation that can encourage cargo
storage.  In late 2009,  oil companies  stored more than 110 million
barrels of crude at sea, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Ole Slorer in  New York  said in an e-mailed note today. That’s the
equivalent of 55 supertankers, known in the industry as very
large crude carriers, or VLCCs.  “As the oil market is heading toward contango, the
supply/demand balance might become irrelevant once again for a
while,” Morgan Stanley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
