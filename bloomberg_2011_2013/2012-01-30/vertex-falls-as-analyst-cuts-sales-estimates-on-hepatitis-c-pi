Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX)  fell the
most in seven weeks after an analyst with Leerink Swann & Co.
cut sales estimates for a hepatitis C pill made by the company
that was approved by U.S. regulators last year.  Vertex’s Incivek, among the first new hepatitis C drugs to
reach the market in almost a decade, may be eclipsed by new
pill-only treatments with fewer side effects and shorter courses
of treatment. Incivek is given with interferon, an injected
medicine.  Merck & Co. ’s similar pill, Victrelis, was also
approved last year.  Shares of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Vertex  fell  3.5
percent to $34.74 at the close in  New York , their biggest one-
day drop since Dec. 8.  Howard Liang , an analyst with Leerink Swann in  Boston ,
reduced his sales forecast for Incivek by 35 percent from $2.3
billion this year to $1.5 billion. Liang also cut his target
price for Vertex shares from $66 to $48.  “In light of recent development of interferon-free
regimens and likely more aggressive development as a result of
recent transactions in the space, we are further curtailing the
Incivek tail,” Liang said in a  note  to clients today.  Vertex had $420 million in revenue from Incivek in the
third quarter of 2011. Revenue from the drug accounts for 64
percent of the company’s sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
