Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317)  led
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  suppliers higher in Taipei trading after the
Cupertino, California-based maker of the iPhone and iPad
reported record earnings last week.  Hon Hai, an Apple product assembler, climbed by the 7
percent daily limit to NT$93.80 as of the close, the biggest
advance since May 2009.  Catcher Technology Co. (2474) , a maker of
iPhone cases, rose 6.9 percent to NT$179, the highest close
since Oct. 28.  Largan Precision Co. (3008) , a lens maker, jumped 6.6
percent to NT$628, the highest since Nov. 9.  Apple’s fiscal first-quarter profit more than doubled to
$13.1 billion as revenue rose 73 percent to $46.3 billion, the
company reported Jan. 24. Looking ahead to the second quarter,
Apple forecast revenue of about $32.5 billion and profit of
$8.50 a share. That compares with average analyst  predictions 
for sales of $31.9 billion and profit of $7.96 a share. Taiwan
trading was closed for a holiday last week.  “Hon Hai could benefit” from Apple’s results, Arthur Hsieh, an analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a Jan. 27 report covering
the world’s largest contract manufacturer of electronics. “The
growth momentum is much more significant than we expected
previously.” UBS raised its recommendation on Hon Hai stock to
“buy” from “neutral.”  Apple’s profit surge comes as tech companies including
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Intel Corp. (INTC)  grapple with slower personal-
computer sales, partly because customers are buying smartphones
and tablets including the iPad instead.  The company sold 37 million iPhones in the period ended
Dec. 31, with customers snapping up the new 4S model that went
on sale in October, a week after the death of co-founder Steve Jobs. Record revenue vaulted Apple ahead of Hewlett-Packard Co.
as the world’s biggest computer maker by sales and quelled
concern that the company’s allure may dim as it embarks on a new
era with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook at the helm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
