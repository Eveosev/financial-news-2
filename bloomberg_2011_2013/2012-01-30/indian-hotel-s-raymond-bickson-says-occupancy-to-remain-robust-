Raymond Bickson, chief executive
officer at  Indian Hotels Co. (IH) , comments on the outlook for the
country’s hospitality industry. He spoke to reporters at the
unveiling of a hotel in the southern city of Hyderabad.  “For the last 9 years, inventory in  India  went from 67,000
rooms to 130,000 rooms. Overall, India is at between 65 percent
and 70 percent occupancy. All of those new rooms have been
absorbed by the market. Barring one or two locations like Pune,
where maybe there is quite a bit of buildup, the market has
totally absorbed those new rooms. We have now just hit 6 million
inbound tourists, and the new number from the government for
domestic travelers has now crossed 740 million  last year. All
of this together means that capacity is growing in the entire
country. Inspite of new inventory, occupancy will still remain
robust at between 65 percent to 70 percent. It is very
sustainable for the next ten years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
