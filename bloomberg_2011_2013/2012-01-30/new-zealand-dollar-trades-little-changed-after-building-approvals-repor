New Zealand â€™s dollar traded little
changed after a report showed home-building approvals increased
2.1 percent in December from the month prior, less than
economists had forecast.  The New Zealand currency fetched 81.83 U.S. cents at 10:45
a.m. in Wellington from 81.84 cents before the release.  The median projection in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists was for building permits to increase by 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
