Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. A federal judge in  New Orleans   ruled Friday  that BP can't collect clean-up costs from Transocean, the company's drilling contractor involved in the 2010 Gulf oil spill. For BP it's another episode of the disaster's "economic effects and the long term-damage to the reputation of the company."  That's the phrase  used by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) in 2010 when they booted BP from the DJSI World Index six weeks into the spill. Sometimes it takes what Dow Jones calls "extraordinary events" to reveal just how unprepared a company is to deal with extraordinary events.
