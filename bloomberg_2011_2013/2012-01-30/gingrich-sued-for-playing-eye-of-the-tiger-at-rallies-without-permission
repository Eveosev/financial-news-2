Newt Gingrich , fighting for the
Republican Party’s nomination to challenge President  Barack Obama  in the 2012 election, was sued for unauthorized use of
“Eye of the Tiger,” the Grammy-winning theme song from “Rocky
III.”  Rude Music Inc., an Illinois corporation owned by Frank
Sullivan, a co-author of the song, sued the candidate today in
federal court in  Chicago , seeking a court order blocking
Gingrich’s unauthorized use of the song at campaign rallies.
Rude Music is also seeking unspecified money damages.  Newt 2012 Inc. and the American Conservative Union, a
political advocacy group, are also named as defendants in the
five-page complaint.  “Newt 2012’s and Mr. Gingrich’s unauthorized public
performance or inducement of or contribution to the public
performance of the copyrighted work infringes Rude Music’s
copyright,” according to the complaint.  Performed by the rock band Survivor, of which Sullivan was
a founding member, “Eye of the Tiger” was released in 1982,
topped the U.S. pop music  charts  and won a  Grammy  Award. It was
also  nominated  for an Academy Award.  R.C. Hammond, a spokesman for the Gingrich campaign, didn’t
immediately reply to an e-mailed request for comment on the
lawsuit.  The case is Rude Music Inc. v. Newt 2012 Inc., 12-cv-00640,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
