Colombia ’s peso posted its biggest
one-day drop this year as concern Greek debt talks will falter
cut into appetite for higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The peso fell 0.6 percent to 1,817.75 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,807.03 on Jan. 27, the biggest decline on a closing basis
since Dec. 28. The peso has jumped 6.6 percent this year, the
fourth-best performer after the Hungarian forint, Brazilian real
and the Mexican peso among a basket of 25 emerging market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  European leaders won’t finalize Greece’s second aid program
today because talks with banks over debt reduction aren’t
completed, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  told reporters before
a European Union summit in Brussels. Leaders are also awaiting a
EU-International Monetary Fund assessment of  Greece ’s current
needs and the status of its economic reforms, Merkel said.  “Investors are taking advantage of the increased risk
aversion to take profit” after the peso’s rally this month,
said Ricardo Bernal, head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage
Serfinco SA.  Colombia’s central bank will leave the overnight lending
rate unchanged at 4.75 percent at its monetary policy meeting
today, according to 31 of 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Daniel Escobar, an analyst at Global Securities brokerage in
Bogota, predicts policy makers will raise the key rate to 5
percent.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.35 percent. The bond’s price fell 0.10 centavo to 121.086
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
