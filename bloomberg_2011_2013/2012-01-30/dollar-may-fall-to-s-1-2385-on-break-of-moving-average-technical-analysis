The dollar may decline toward the
lowest level in three months against its  Singapore  counterpart
after falling below the 200-day moving average, Forecast Pte.
said, citing technical patterns.  The greenback may approach a key support level at S$1.2385,
said Winston Tang, a technical analyst at Forecast. The currency
touched its 200-day moving average versus Singapore’s dollar on
Jan. 26, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The close below the 200-day average should boost the
downside,” Singapore-based Tang said. The dollar may “reach
S$1.2385 in less than a week,” he said.  The U.S. currency was little changed from yesterday at
$1.2581 as of 6:56 a.m. in Singapore. It last reached S$1.2385
on Oct. 31. The U.S. currency’s 200-day average was at $1.2541.  Its moving average convergence/divergence, or MACD, was at
negative 0.0097, below the signal line of minus 0.0072,
Bloomberg data show. A reading below the signal line indicates
the dollar may weaken.  The 200-day moving average is a technical indicator that
displays the average value of a security over that time period.
MACD is a gauge of momentum and is calculated by subtracting the
26-day exponential moving average from the 12-day average. The
signal line is a nine-day exponential moving average of the
MACD, and provides buy and sell signals. Support is where
buy orders may be clustered.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
