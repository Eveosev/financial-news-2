Russian stocks fell for a second day
as oil, the country’s chief export, declined amid speculation
the European Union summit today will fail to draw a line under
the sovereign-debt crisis.  The Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 stocks retreated 0.8 percent to
1,496.26 by 1:06 p.m. in Moscow, adding to a 0.4 percent drop on
Jan. 27.  United Co. Rusal (RUALR) , the world’s largest aluminum company,
and OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of  Russia ’s gas export
monopoly, slid 2.3 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index slipped 0.8 percent to 1,553.11,
heading for its biggest drop since Jan. 11.  Oil, Russia’s main export revenue earner, fell as much as
0.8 percent to $98.74 a barrel in  New York , after declining 14
cents on Jan. 27. EU leaders will meet in Brussels today to put
finishing touches on a German-led deficit-control strategy and
endorse a 500 billion-euro ($657 billion) rescue fund.  Gazprom Neft  retreated to 147.63 rubles, heading for its
lowest level since Jan. 16, while Russian depositary receipts of
United Co. Rusal posted the biggest decline in the Micex today
to 233.01 rubles as metal prices declined.  The Micex has gained 6.8 percent this year and trades at
5.7 times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies.
That compares with an 11 percent gain so far in 2012 for
 Brazil ’s Bovespa index, which is at 10 times estimated earnings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite
Index trades at 9.4 times estimated earnings, and the BSE India
Sensitive Index has a ratio of 14.8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
