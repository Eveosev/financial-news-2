NCR Corp. (NCR) , the world’s biggest
supplier of automated teller machines, will open a service
center and a research and development unit in  Serbia  next month,
the government said.  The investment, worth 5 million euros ($6.56 million) to 6
million euros in the first phase, will include a call center for
client support covering southeastern Europe, northern Africa and
the  Middle East , Serbia’s Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said.  “NCR is opening a new remote services support center in
Belgrade to provide remote service support for customers,” the
company said in e-mailed comment. Serbia was chosen “after
carefully considering a number of factors, including a
multilingual workforce, reliable infrastructure and government
support.”  Ciric said the Duluth, Georgia-based company may have as
many as 300 to 400 engineers in Belgrade as part of the
investment expected to exceed 10 million euros, including the
software development that will open in the second half of
February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
