Universal Solar System , a developer
of clean-energy projects in  India , completed its first 2-
megawatt plant in Gujarat state.  The project, located at a solar park in Patan, used panels
supplied by Miasole Inc. and inverters from  SMA Solar Technology
AG (S92) , Universal said in an e-mailed statement. The Ahmedabad-based
company plans to develop power plants in the U.S. through its
offices in Texas and  California , it said.  Gujarat, home to India’s biggest solar program, has awarded
licenses to build solar plants with a combined 959 megawatts.
The projects were awarded a tariff ranging from 11 rupees (22
cents) to 15 rupees per kilowatt-hour for the first 12 years,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
