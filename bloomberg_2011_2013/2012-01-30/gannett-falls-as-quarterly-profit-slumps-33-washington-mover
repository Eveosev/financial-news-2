Gannett Co. (GCI) , the owner of 82
newspapers including  USA Today , declined the most in more than
three months after reporting a fourth  straight drop  in quarterly
profit amid declining advertising sales.  The stock fell 6.9 percent to $14.17 at the close, making
it the  worst performer  on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX) , after the McLean,
Virginia-based Gannett posted a 33 percent decrease in fourth-
quarter net income.  Revenue from the publishing division, the largest unit,
declined 5.3 percent as advertising and circulation fell. The
newspaper industry overall has continued to lose ad business to
Internet companies such as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc.  “You’re going to see lower newspaper advertising right
across the sector,” said  Edward Atorino , an analyst at
Benchmark Co. in New York who recommends buying the shares and
doesn’t personally own any.  Former Chief Operating Officer Gracia Martore took over as
chief executive in October after Craig Dubow resigned for
medical reasons.  Net income fell to $116.9 million, or 49 cents a share,
last quarter, from $174.1 million, or 72 cents, a year earlier,
the company said today in a statement. That included expenses of
$63.6 million to consolidate printer facilities and costs of
$14.7 million related to Dubow’s disability retirement.  Profit excluding those items and others was 72 cents,
beating the average of 68 cents of analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Sales at the company, also owner of 23 broadcast stations
reaching 21 million households, decreased 5.1 percent to $1.39
billion, compared with the average estimate of $1.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
