Energy Development Corp. (EDC)  shares fell
the most in more than two years after the Philippines’ largest
geothermal company said repair works at its BacMan plant complex
will be extended.  Energy Development tumbled 9.8 percent to 5.68 pesos as of
2 p.m. in Manila, set for its biggest decline since April 2009.
 First Gen Corp. (FGEN) , Energy Development’s parent, dropped 8.2
percent to 13.26 pesos, the most since March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
