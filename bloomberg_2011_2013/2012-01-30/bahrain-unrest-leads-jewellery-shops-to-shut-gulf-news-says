Twenty-five of 90 shops in Bahrain’s
Gold Souq have closed since the outbreak of unrest last year,
Gulf Daily News said, citing Mohammed Sajid Shaikh, head of the
Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s gold and pearl
jewellery committee.  Many jewellery traders in Manama had been defaulting on
rent and utility bills due to the drop in revenue, the paper
cited Shaikh as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
