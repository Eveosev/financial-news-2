L’Oreal SA (OR) , the French beauty-care
company, sued the owners of Coppertone and Neutrogena, claiming
their sunscreens use its patented ingredients.  L’Oreal accused  Merck & Co. , the maker of Coppertone, and
 Johnson & Johnson , which owns Neutrogena Corp., of patent
infringement in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, on Jan.
27.  The “acts of infringement have caused and will continue to
cause damage to L’Oreal,” the Paris-based company said in court
papers. L’Oreal claims it has patented a mixture of compounds
that help stabilize its sunscreen. That mixture appears in so-
called avobenzone sunscreens and uses the compound octocrylene,
according to court papers.  Last year, L’Oreal earned 2.51 billion euros ($3.29
billion) on revenue of 20.3 billion euros, according to
information compiled by Bloomberg.  The company seeks unspecified damages after a  jury trial , a
ruling that the patents are infringed and an order to stop
further use its inventions.  L’Oreal rose 32 cents to 81.44 euros today in trading on
the Paris stock exchange.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  spokeswoman Seema Kumar and Merck
spokeswoman Amy Rose didn’t immediately return phone and e-mail
messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The cases are L’Oreal v. Johnson & Johnson, 12CV98 and
L’Oreal v. Merck & Co., 12CV99, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
