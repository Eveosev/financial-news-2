Russia  won’t support a United
Nations Security Council resolution proposed by Arab and Western
countries that calls on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to cede
power, Interfax reported, citing Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov.  “This document isn’t balanced and it opens the door to
intervention in Syrian affairs,” Gatilov said, according to the
news service. The latest draft resolution proposed by the West
isn’t fundamentally different to an October resolution on  Syria 
vetoed by Russia, and “obviously can’t be supported by us,” he
said.  Countries including Qatar, the U.K. and the U.S. revised
their proposed UN Security Council resolution in a bid to
overcome Russian objections, with a call for Assad to transfer
power to a deputy. Previous language, which urged Assad to
relinquish power to pave way for elections, was replaced with a
call for him to hand over “full authority” to his deputy and
for the “formation of a national unity government,” according
to the draft obtained by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
