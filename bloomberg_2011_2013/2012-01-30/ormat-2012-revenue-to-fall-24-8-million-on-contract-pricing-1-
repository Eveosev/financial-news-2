Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) , a U.S.
developer of geothermal energy, said revenue will decline this
year after forecasted natural-gas prices used in several power-
purchase agreements with utilities were cut.  Revenue in 2012 will fall by an estimated $24.8 million,
the Reno, Nevada-based company said today in a statement. The
reduction represents about 5.9 percent of forecasted 2011
revenue. Still, 2012 revenue is expected to equal or exceed last
year’s, according to the statement.  Ormat fell as much as 3.7 percent to $16.86.  Ormat’s contracts for the power plants Heber 1 and 2,
Ormesa, and Mammoth in  California  were adversely affected by a
decrease in gas-price forecasts and the delay of California’s
greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program, which is now expected to
begin in 2013, according to the statement. Revenue in 2013 is
expected to fall by an estimated $24.9 million, the company
said.  The company may seek to modify some of the contracts to
fixed pricing that’s not subject to the same factors, which are
“uncertain,” Ormat said. The company’s official guidance for
2012 will be provided in its 2011 fourth quarter and year-end
earnings announcement scheduled for February 22, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
