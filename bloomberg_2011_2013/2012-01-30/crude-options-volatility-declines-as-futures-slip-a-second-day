Crude oil options volatility
declined after underlying futures fell for a second day as
European leaders sparred with  Greece  over a debt reduction
program to keep the region’s financial crisis from spreading.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.6 as of 3:30 p.m. in  New York , down
from 27.7 on Jan. 27.  Crude for March delivery fell 78 cents to settle at $98.78
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Jan. 20.  “Volatility is up a little off the down move,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $95 puts, with 1,757 lots changing hands at 3:36 p.m. They
fell 5 cents to 92 cents a barrel. March $90 puts, the second-
most active option, declined 4 cents to 27 cents with 1,495 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  “Earlier today, we had some March $88 and $80 puts
trading,” said Rigolini, who trades for clients on the Nymex.  Puts accounted for 69 percent of electronic trading volume
and were six of the seven most-active contracts.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Bearish options accounted for 58 percent of volume in the
previous session. September $80 puts were the most actively
traded, with 4,210 lots changing hands as they rose 7 cents to
$3.18 a barrel. The next-most active options, March $95 puts,
declined 2 cents to 97 cents on volume of 3,994 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 39,924
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 36,812 lots and
December $100 calls with 32,917.  To contact the reporter on this story:
