Japanese  stock   futures  fell as
European leaders struggled to complete a Greek rescue program
and U.S. consumer spending stalled, sparking concern global
economic growth may slow. Australian shares were little changed.  American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , which
gets about 80 percent of its sales overseas, fell 0.6 percent
after the yen strengthened, cutting the earnings outlook for the
exporter. Those of  Canon Inc. (7751)  sank 2.8 percent after the camera
maker forecast profit that missed estimates and said its
president will step down.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s top oil
producer, lost 0.3 percent in Sydney after crude prices declined.  “There’s more uncertainty about the rescue plan for Greece
and the debt swap, so investors are wary,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.
“The yen continues to strengthen, which is a catalyst for blue-
chip shares to get sold.”  Futures on  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 8,760 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 8,800
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,760 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
rose less than 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
lost 0.6 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The gauge slid 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday
as European leaders sparred with Greece over a second rescue
program.  16th Euro Summit  Commerce Department figures yesterday showed U.S. consumer
spending stalled in December, with purchases little changed
after rising 0.1 percent the prior month. The weak end to the
quarter makes it more likely private consumption, which accounts
for the majority of the  U.S. economy , will cool early this year.  At Europe’s 16th summit since  Greece ’s fiscal emergency
triggered a regional crisis, leaders yesterday completed a
fiscal-discipline treaty, which speeds sanctions on high-deficit
states and requires euro countries to anchor balanced-budget
rules in national law. Eight countries outside the euro backed
the pact, leaving Britain and the  Czech Republic  to boycott it.  The yen appreciated to as high as 99.99 against the euro
last night in Tokyo, the highest level since Jan. 23. Against
the dollar, Japan’s currency strengthened to 76.22 today from
76.67 at the close of  stock trading  yesterday. It touched 75.35
yen Oct. 31, a post- World War II low.  Oil, Metals  Crude oil for March delivery slid 0.8 percent to settle at
$98.78 a barrel in New York yesterday. The London Metal Exchange
Index of prices for six industrial commodities including copper
and aluminum lost 0.9 percent, the biggest drop since Jan. 20.  The China-US 55 Index  of the most-traded Chinese stocks in
the U.S. fell 1.5 percent to 102.61 in New York yesterday, the
steepest decrease since Dec. 19.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 7.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with increases of 4.4 percent by the
S&P 500 and 3.3 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 1.3 times book value. That
compares with 2.1 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in
the U.S. and 1.4 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index in Europe.  The Japanese government is scheduled to release a report on
industrial production at 8:50 a.m. today in Tokyo. Output may
rise 3 percent from a month earlier, according to the median
estimate of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
