Saab AB (SAABB) , which won a tentative
Gripen jet fighter order with Switzerland, said final
negotiations may take all year and that it’s “natural” that
rival  Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  is still fighting for a deal.  “It’s not surprising they haven’t given up,” Erik Magni,
a  Saab (SAS)  spokesman, said today by phone. It’s “part of the game”
that Dassault is still competing, he said.  Saab and Switzerland are holding negotiations that probably
will “take up all of 2012,” Magni said, adding the country’s
parliament has yet to make a decision and that the nation may
hold a referendum on the issue.  Dassault made a fresh attempt to sell its Rafale fighter to
 Switzerland , offering 18 of the aircraft for 2.7 billion Swiss
francs ($2.94 billion) after the government picked Saab in
November, SonntagsZeitung reported, citing a letter sent to
politicians.  The offer is about 400 million Swiss francs cheaper than
the price Saab set for 22 Gripen jets Switzerland agreed to buy,
the newspaper reported. Dassault initially demanded 4 billion
francs for 22 Rafale jets. The new offer reduces the number of
planes and adapts the jets more to Swiss requirements, the
report said.  Dassault spokesmen didn’t immediately return calls seeking
comment.  Saab fell as much as 2.7 percent and was down 2 percent at
145.1 kronor at 11 a.m. in Stockholm.  Dassault was up 0.8
percent in Paris.  To contact the reporters on this story:
