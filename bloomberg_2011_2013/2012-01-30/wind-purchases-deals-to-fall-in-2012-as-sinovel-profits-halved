Purchases of  wind turbines  and other
equipment will decline 14 percent this year and won’t surpass
2011 levels for two years, reducing profits at companies
including  Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558) , according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  Capital investment  in wind-power assets worldwide will be
$69.2 billion in 2012, down from $80.5 billion last year, as
oversupply and waning government support in the U.S. and  Europe 
cut demand. Total installations, including onshore and offshore
projects, will be 49 gigawatts, said Justin Wu, head of wind
analysis at New Energy Finance in  Hong Kong .  Sinovel, China’s top turbine maker, said yesterday it
expects 2011 profit to decrease by more than half from 2.86
billion yuan ($451.6 million) in 2010.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) 
this month cut 10 percent of its staff after twice reducing
sales forecasts since October.  Struggling wind-equipment makers are less likely to get
bought than solar companies because they have less to offer
buyers, said Martin Prozesky, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein
Ltd.  “I think there’s a bigger risk for the smaller guys to go
out of business more than being bought up,” Prozesky said in a
telephone interview from  London . “There isn’t any real
technology that you can acquire with smaller players now.
There’s maybe a bit of manufacturing, but not a huge amount.”  Installations won’t surpass last year’s total until 2014,
when New Energy Finance expects spending to reach $87 billion.  2011 Acquisitions Doubled  Acquisitions of wind companies last year, excluding direct
investment and private-equity buyouts, more than doubled to
$16.6 billion from $7.2 billion in 2010, the London-based
research company said.  That was the sixth increase in seven years, driven largely
by two deals in the third quarter worth about $11 billion
together. Electricite de France SA and  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  both
purchased the remaining stakes of partially owned subsidiaries.  “Third quarter 2011 was unusually large,” said Amy Grace,
a New Energy Finance wind analyst in  New York . “We potentially
could see some more activity in terms of the volume of project
acquisitions this year, but dollar amounts won’t likely reach
the 2011 level.”  One market that is growing is offshore wind. Investment is
predicted to increase 44 percent to $8.5 billion this year and
to climb for the following eight years. By 2020, about $55
billion will be spent on offshore wind farms, compared with
$84.7 billion for onshore projects, according to New Energy
Finance.  Offshore Growth  About 12 gigawatts of offshore turbines will be installed
in 2020, compared with 2 gigawatts this year.  General Electric (GE)  installed an offshore turbine in Sweden’s
Gothenburg Harbor in December, and  Siemens AG (SIE)  won contracts for
six offshore wind farms totaling 1.4 gigawatts  in 2011 ,
including a project in  China .  “If companies like Siemens and others are looking to
extend in this sector, then they’re looking more to the East
than to the West,” Ankit Jain, an analyst at  Standard & Poor’s 
in London, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
