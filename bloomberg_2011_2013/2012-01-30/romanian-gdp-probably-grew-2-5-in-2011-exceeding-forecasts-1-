Romania ’s economy probably expanded
at a faster pace than the International Monetary Fund’s
estimates for 2011 after growing in the fourth quarter, said
Jeffrey Franks, the fund’s mission chief to the country.  Gross domestic product probably grew about 2.5 percent in
2011, surpassing the Washington-based lender’s forecast of 1.5
percent, Franks said in a televised speech from Bucharest today.
The fund expects output to continue to grow this year and next,
Franks said, without giving estimates.  “We estimate economic growth at about 2.5 percent last
year, so more than we had forecast, which is certainly good
news,” Franks said during a meeting with Romanian trade unions
in Bucharest. “The bad news is that we’re going to face very
strong challenges which might be impeding the recovery of growth
over the coming period.”  Romania, which exited a two-year recession in 2011, saw
economic growth accelerating to the fastest in three years in
the third quarter, sparked by a bumper harvest and a recovery in
domestic consumption. The country suffered its worst contraction
on record from 2009 until 2011.  Pension, Wage Increases  Prime Minister Emil Boc has been mandated by the ruling
governing coalition to hold talks with the IMF and the European
Union over pension and wages increases from April, Liberal
Democrat Vice-President Gheorghe Flutur told reporters in
Bucharest today.  A joint IMF and EU mission is currently in Bucharest to
conduct a two-week review of the country’s progress under a 5
billion-euro ($6.5 billion) precautionary loan.  Export-driven growth will probably slow in 2012 to between
1.8 percent to 2.3 percent, compared with a previous forecast of
3.5 percent as  Europe ’s debt crisis slows growth in Romania’s
major trading partners, Franks said on Nov. 7.  The IMF may lower its estimate for Romania this year to as
low as 1 percent, Ziarul Financiar  reported today , citing
unidentified people. The economy may expand between 1 percent
and 1.5 percent in 2012, slower than a previous forecast of 1.8
percent to 2.3 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
