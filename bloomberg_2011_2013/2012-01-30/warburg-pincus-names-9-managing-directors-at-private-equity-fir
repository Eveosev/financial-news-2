Warburg Pincus  LLC, the private-
equity firm with more than $30 billion in assets under
management, hired two people to focus on energy deals and
fundraising and promoted seven others to be managing directors.  Warburg hired Somit Varma from International Finance Corp.,
a member of the World Bank Group, to work on energy transactions
from New York, and Mazin Al Khatib from Investcorp Bank to work
on fundraising from  London . Both will be managing directors, the
firm said today in an e-mailed statement.  The firm promoted seven others in areas including
technology, media and telecommunications; real estate; and
fundraising in offices around the world. Warburg, based in New
York, focuses on growth investing.  “It is their unique combination of sector and regional
knowledge, along with years of valuable investment experience,
that enables Warburg Pincus to be an experienced partner,”
Charles Kaye, Warburg’s co-president, said in the statement.  Warburg, founded in 1966 and led by Kaye and Joseph Landy,
last month agreed to provide as much as $355 million to First
Green Partners, which will back renewable-energy technologies.
Warburg has 65 managing directors after the hirings and
promotions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
