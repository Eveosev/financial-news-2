JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) ,  Japan ’s second-
largest steelmaker, forecast its first annual loss as slowing
economies reduced demand for the metal used in cars, ships and
construction and the yen’s strength erode sales.  The steelmaker forecast a loss of 40 billion yen ($522
million) for the year ending March 31, the first annual loss
since it was created from the merger of Kawasaki Steel Corp. and
NKK Corp. in 2002, Executive Vice President Yoshio Ishikawa said
today. JFE said Oct. 26 it may post net income of 20 billion yen.  The European sovereign-debt crisis has cut demand for steel
in countries, including  China , as profits at Japanese mills are
being squeezed by a strong yen. JFE today cut its full-year
production target to 27 million metric tons from 28 million tons.  “A slump in overseas steel markets is more prolonged than
anticipated,” Ishikawa said at a media briefing in  Tokyo .
“Things are also tough at home because of the yen’s gains,
which are eroding the competitiveness of the Japanese industry
and delaying a recovery in demand.”  JFE had a loss of 12.9 billion yen in the three months
ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of 18.5 billion yen a year
earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on nine-month
results released today.  The shares fell 0.8 percent to 1,397 yen on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange after the earnings announcement, compared with the 0.5
percent decline in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Securities Valuation Loss  The steelmaker posted a 93.9 billion-yen charge in the nine
months ended Dec. 31 to write down the value of its
stockholdings, mostly for JSW Steel Ltd., Ishikawa said. In 2010,
JFE paid $1 billion for a 14.99 percent stake in JSW.  JFE and  IHI Corp. (7013) , in talks to combine their shipbuilding
units since April 2008, will merge the divisions on Oct. 1, the
companies said in a statement to the Tokyo stock exchange today.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , JFE’s larger domestic rival, last week
reported its first loss in three quarters and forecast it will
break even for the year to March 31. The company said Oct. 26 it
expects full-year profit of 85 billion yen.  Japan’s steel output may decline by between 2 million and 3
million tons this year as reconstruction efforts after the
earthquake and tsunami in March last year are unlikely to make
up for falling demand from shipbuilders and other manufacturers,
said  Eiji Hayashida , the chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel
Federation. He is also the president of JFE’s steelmaking unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
