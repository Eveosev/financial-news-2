Nippon Electric Glass Co. (5214)  fell the
most in three months in Tokyo trading as slowing economic
growth, especially in  Europe , and a stronger yen prompted the
maker of glass for TVs and cameras to forecast a drop in profit.  Net income in the year ending March 31 will be as low as
28.5 billion yen ($371 million), 59 percent less than a year
earlier, the company said in a statement after markets closed in
Tokyo on Jan. 27. The companyâ€™s forecast range of 28.5 billion
yen to 31.5 billion yen is less than the 34 billion yen average
of 16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The shares  dropped  as much as 10 percent to 668 yen, the
biggest intraday decline since Oct. 27, and traded at 670 yen as
of 11:04 a.m. on the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange. The benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average declined 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
