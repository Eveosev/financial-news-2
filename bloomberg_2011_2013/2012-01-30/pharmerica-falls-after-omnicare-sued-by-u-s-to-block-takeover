PharMerica Corp. (PMC) , the drug-supply
company  Omnicare Inc. (OCR)  is targeting with a $440.8 million
unsolicited takeover bid, fell the most in more than three
months after U.S. regulators sued to block the deal.  Pharmerica fell 11 percent to $12.69, the biggest intraday
decline since Oct. 4, at 9:49 a.m. in New York. The Federal
Trade Commission said Jan. 27 that merging the first and second-
largest drug suppliers to nursing homes would increase prices
for Medicare recipients, passing on the costs to taxpayers.  PharMerica, based in Louisville,  Kentucky , has said the $15-
a-share bid price undervalued the company. The company said
today in a statement that Covington, Kentucky-based Omnicare
should drop the offer.  “We believed antitrust clearance would be difficult to
achieve and, with that belief now confirmed, we hope that
Omnicare will end its hostile pursuit of PharMerica,” Chief
Executive Officer Gregory Weishar said in the statement.  Omnicare, which pursued the acquisition to save money
through automation and scale amid U.S. cuts to health-care
spending, fell 1.3 percent to $32.63.  To contact the reporter on this story:
