Boris Berezovsky  won a London court
order placing $600 million from billionaire Vasily Anisimov’s
sale of a stake in Russia’s largest iron-ore producer into an
escrow account, said three people with knowledge of the matter.  Anisimov can’t touch almost a quarter of the $2.5 billion
that state-controlled VTB Group paid for his 20 percent of
mining company  Metalloinvest Holding (METIN)  after the U.K. High Court
ruling in December, the people said, declining to be named
because the ruling isn’t public.  Berezovsky, the self-exiled former billionaire adviser to
President  Boris Yeltsin , filed a claim in 2009 to recover money
he said he loaned Anisimov to buy a mining asset that became
part of Metalloinvest, two of the people said.  The court allowed the sale to VTB,  Russia ’s second-biggest
lender, while forcing $600 million into the special escrow
account until a decision is made on the case, the people said.
The trial will begin in October, an external press official for
the businessman said by e-mail, declining to comment on the
funds and asking not to be identified.  Anisimov’s legal counsel and VTB’s press service declined
to comment when called by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
