The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment rose,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2 basis points to 183.5 as of 9:05
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The measure is set for its second straight daily increase, up
from a three-month low of 180.4 marked on Jan. 26, according to
data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index rose 1 basis point to 162.5
as of 9:54 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The gauge
fell 12.9 basis points last week, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was unchanged at 156
basis points as of 12:05 in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
