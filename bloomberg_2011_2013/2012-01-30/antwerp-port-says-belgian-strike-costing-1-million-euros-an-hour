Belgium’s national strike today by
the country’s three main unions to protest government austerity
will cost the Port of Antwerp 1 million euros ($1.3 million) an
hour in lost “added value,” the port said.  Most terminals at the port are closed, vessel traffic is
disrupted and dock workers stopped working at 6 a.m. local time,
Annik Dirkx, a spokeswoman for the port, said today by
telephone.  “The Port of Antwerp regrets that a strike that is not
opposed to the port is affecting the port this much,” Dirkx
said. “Besides the financial loss, there is also, even more
important, the damage that is caused to our reputation on an
international level as a fast, reliable and efficient port.”  Belgian public transport including domestic and
international rail services was brought to a standstill as
workers struck to oppose government reforms to pensions and
spending cuts. Trams, bus and subway services were halted in
Brussels, where European Union leaders are meeting today to
discuss ways to boost growth and jobs. Some flights from the
capital’s international airport were also canceled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
