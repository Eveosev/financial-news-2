Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa â€™s third-largest airline, dropped the most in more than
two weeks in Nairobi trading after saying full-year profit will
decline at least 25 percent.  The stock fell as much as 3.7 percent to 19.50 shillings
and closed 2 percent lower at 19.85 shillings, the biggest
decline since Jan. 13.  The airline will report a drop in profit for the year to
March 31 after the European debt crisis, rising fuel prices and
political unrest in Egypt and Nigeria curbed revenue, it said in
an e-mailed statement on Jan. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
