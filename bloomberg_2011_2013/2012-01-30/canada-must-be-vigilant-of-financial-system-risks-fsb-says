Canada must “remain vigilant” of
risks to its  financial industry , global regulators said in a
report on the country published yesterday.  “Particular attention” should be paid to “the exposure
of the economy and financial system to adverse global economic
developments, and the increasing indebtedness of Canadian
households,” the Financial Stability Board said in an
assessment of the country’s regulation.  Canadian authorities should consider giving regulators
additional powers to combat credit booms, said the FSB, which is
led by Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney . Another priority
should be to implement rules for credit-rating companies and
structured finance products, the group said.  The FSB includes regulators, central bankers and finance-
ministry officials from the Group of 20 countries. The G-20
brings together governments from the main industrialized and
emerging economies to tackle global problems and co-ordinate
their policies and rulemaking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
