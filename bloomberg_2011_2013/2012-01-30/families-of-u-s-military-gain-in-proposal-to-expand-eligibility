The Obama administration proposed
rules expanding benefits of the family leave act to let
relatives of military personnel care for injured veterans, and
revised provisions for airline flight crews.  The Labor Department proposed extending for five years the
right for a family member to take a leave after a relative
leaves the military, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said.
Previously, Family Medical Leave Act provisions expired when a
service member left the military, she said. Time-off for
emergencies will now cover families with relatives in all
services, expanded from families of National Guard members and
reservists.  “Keeping the basic promise of America alive means ensuring
that workers, from our servicemen and servicewomen who keep us
safe at home to the flight crews who keep us safe in the skies,
have the resources, support and opportunities they need and have
rightfully earned,” Solis said.  The new rule adds calculations to determine the amount of
time used by airline crew members, which are often more
difficult to determine than other jobs, Solis said.  The Department estimates that 15,500 eligible employees
will take 854,000 days, or 6.8 million hours, of leave annually
to act as a caregiver for a veteran who is undergoing treatment
for a serious illness or injury. More than 193,000 family
members could be covered by the changed rule, according to Labor
Department statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
