Ticket prices for the Super Bowl
rematch between the  New York  Giants and  New England Patriots 
have fallen more than $300 in the last three days.  The average price for a ticket to the Feb. 5 game at Lucas
Oil Stadium in Indianapolis fell to $3,982 from $4,311 since
Jan. 27, according to data released today by TiqIQ, a ticket
event aggregator that tracks listings from StubHub, EBay,
TicketNetwork and TicketsNow.  The least expensive ticket to the  National Football
League ’s championship game is $2,090, down from a high of $2,400
on Jan. 27, according to TiqIQ.  The most expensive ticket purchased on the NFL Ticket
Exchange, the league’s official resale website, was sold last
week for $16,480.  Prices probably will decline gradually and won’t fall much
further, according to Will Flaherty, a spokesman for SeatGeek,
an event ticket aggregator that has its cheapest listing at
$2,247 for an upper-deck end-zone seat.  “For the fans that really want to hold out, the best call
is to wait until 24 hours before the game,” Flaherty said in a
telephone interview. “My best guess is that if you want to get
into the game and sit in the nose bleeds, you should expect to
pay over $2,000.”  The face value of tickets is $800-$1,200.  SeatGeek assigns scores to tickets in each available
section to determine where there are  good deals  compared to
similar stadium locations. For example, a 20th row seat in
Section 142 -- which is at the 25-yard line -- is $10,895.
Moving one section closer to the end zone, a fan could save more
than half that money with a 28th-row seat for $5,404.  “Increasingly, we’ve seen some better deals creeping in
across the stadium,” Flaherty said.  High Demand  Prices have come down about 20 percent on  StubHub.com  in
the last week, though demand remains high with more than 10
million page views for Super Bowl tickets on the reseller’s
website, according to the company.  The Patriots (15-3) are favored by 2 1/2 to 3 points,
depending on the sports book, in the rematch of the 2008  Super
Bowl , which New York won 17-14. That victory ended  New England ’s
bid for a perfect season. This season, the Giants (12-7) also
beat the Patriots 24-20 in a Nov. 6 game in Foxborough,
 Massachusetts .  To contact the reporter on this story:
