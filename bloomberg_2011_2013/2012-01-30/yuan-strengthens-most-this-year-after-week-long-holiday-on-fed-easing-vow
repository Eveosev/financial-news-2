The yuan advanced on its first day
of trade following a one-week holiday, after the dollar fell as
the  Federal Reserve  vowed to maintain low borrowing costs.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  slid 1.7 percent last week as the Fed
pledged to keep  interest rates  “extremely low” through 2014,
preserving the emerging-market yield advantage over Treasuries.
Chinese financial markets were closed from Jan. 23 to Jan. 27
for the Lunar New Year holidays. World Trade Organization
Director-General Pascal Lamy said last week the yuan is
undervalued, while Xinhua News Agency reported that  Li Daokui ,
adviser to the People’s Bank of China, said there’s signs the
currency is near its equilibrium level.  “The yuan’s gain today reflects more on the weakness of
the greenback in the past week, rather than China reacting to
political pressure on appreciation,” said Kenix Lai, a Hong
Kong-based currency analyst at Bank of East Asia Ltd.
“Investors are awaiting for a new set of economic data this
week to see where  China ’s policy will be heading.”  The yuan gained 0.13 percent to close at 6.3310 per dollar
in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency rose as much as 0.43 percent earlier, the
biggest advance since Dec. 16. The People’s Bank of China raised
the reference rate by 0.13 percent to 6.3056, the strongest
level since Jan. 4. The currency is allowed to trade as much as
0.5 percent on either side of the fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan retreated 0.32
percent to 6.3065, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.25 percent to
6.2790, a 0.8 percent premium to the onshore spot rate.  China is scheduled to release a manufacturing  purchasing
managers’ index  for January on Feb. 1. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg estimate the gauge will be 49.6, compared with 50.3 in
December. Fifty is the dividing line between contraction and
expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
