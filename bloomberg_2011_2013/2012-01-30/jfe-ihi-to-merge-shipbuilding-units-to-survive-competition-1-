JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , Japan’s second-
largest steelmaker, and  IHI Corp. (7013)  agreed to merge their
shipbuilding units to create a builder to compete with South
Korean and Chinese rivals.  JFE and IHI will each hold 45.93 percent of the merged
company while Hitachi Zosen will take 8.15 percent, they said in
a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The units will be
combined on Oct. 1 and achieve cost savings of 10 billion yen
($130 million), they said, without providing merger terms.  JFE’s Universal Shipbuilding Corp. had sales of 205.5
billion yen in the year to March 31 last year, while Marine
United Inc., IHI’s vessel builder, had revenue of 176.2 billion
yen. Universal President Shinjiro Mishima will be president of
the merged entity, he said.  Shipbuilders in  Japan  have struggled as slowing economies
sap demand for new ships and sustained gains in the yen makes
domestic-built ships more expensive than South Korean and
Chinese vessels. Japan lost its title as world’s biggest
shipbuilding country to  South Korea  in 2000 before falling into
third place behind  China  in 2009.  “We’ve been left far behind,” Mishima said. “Unless we
can achieve a certain size, we won’t be able to compete
with rivals in terms of bargaining power and meet the challenges
of developing a wider range of vessels.”  Main Threat  He said South Korean shipbuilders with sales of between 500
billion yen and 1 trillion yen were the main threat to Japanese
shipbuilders, without identifying companies.  The companies don’t plan to cut jobs or close ship yards
after the combination, Mishima said. Tokyo-based JFE and IHI
started discussion on the merger in April 2008.  Universal Shipbuilding (UNSHZ)  was created in 2002 when NKK Corp.,
now a part of JFE, and  Hitachi Zosen (7004)  merged their shipbuilding
operations. Marine United is a wholly owned unit of IHI, a
Tokyo-based heavy machinery maker.  JFE, which said earlier today it expects to report its
first annual loss this fiscal year, fell 0.8 percent to close at
1,397 yen on the Tokyo stock exchange. IHI rose 2.5 percent to
203 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
