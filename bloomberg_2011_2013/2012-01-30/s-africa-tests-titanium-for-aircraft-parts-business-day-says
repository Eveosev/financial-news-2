South African research agencies and
closely-held aircraft parts manufacturer Aerosud (Pty) Ltd. are
spending 28 million rand ($3.6 million) on a project to produce
parts from powdered titanium,  Business Day  reported, citing
Sibusiso Sibisi, chief executive officer of the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research.  The manufacturing platform uses powered titanium developed
by the CSIR, which leads to less wastage, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. The process is currently being commercialized
and a pilot plant will be built during the year, the newspaper
cited  Derek Hanekom , deputy science and technology minister, as
saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
