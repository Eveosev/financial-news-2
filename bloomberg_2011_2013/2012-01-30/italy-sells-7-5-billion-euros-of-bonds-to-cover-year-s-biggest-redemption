Italy  sold 7.5 billion euros ($9.8
billion) of debt, near the maximum for the auction, with the
Treasury’s borrowing costs falling as it prepares for its
biggest redemption of the year.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 2 billion euros of a benchmark
10-year bond at 6.08 percent, down from 6.98 percent at the last
auction on Dec. 29. The Treasury also sold 3.57 billion euros of
5-year bonds at 5.39 percent, down from 6.47 at the last auction
of similar securities on Dec. 14, and a total of 1.9 billion
euros bonds due 2016 and 2021 bonds.  “All in all, demand was not too bad but some caution seems
to have prevailed, given the recent tightening of Italian
spreads,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed income analyst at Newedge
Group in  London , said in a note published after the auction.  Today’s sale raised funds needed to cover a 25.8 billion-
euro bond redemption on Feb. 1, the biggest of the year. The
Treasury needs to sell about 450 billion euros of bonds and
bills in 2012 to cover redemptions and finance the deficit.
Investors bid for 1.42 times the amount of 10-year bonds
offered, up from 1.36 last month.  EU Summit  The auction comes as European Union leaders gather in
Brussels to strengthen fiscal rules and build a stronger
firewall to try to stop the spread of the region’s debt crisis.
Their efforts are being overshadowed by complications in closing
a deal with Greek creditors to accept writedowns on their bonds,
pushing up yields for other highly-indebted countries such as
Italy.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose 22 basis points to 6.12
percent at 11:45 a.m. in Rome, the biggest intraday gain this
year, pushing the difference with German bunds to 429 basis
points.  Italian auctions this year have benefited from the
 European Central Bank ’s efforts to fight the spread of the debt
crisis by shoring up banks and propping up demand for  government
bonds . The Frankfurt-based ECB loaned euro-region banks a record
489 billion euros for three years on Dec. 21 to avert a credit
crunch and has bought more than 200 billion euros of government
bonds since beginning the purchases in May.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  pushed through budget
cuts and tax increases worth 20 billion euros in December,
including higher levies on fuel and a tax on primary homes, in a
bid to convince investors Italy can tame the euro-region’s
second-biggest debt and curb record borrowing costs.  To counter the austerity, the government this month passed
a second plan aimed at boosting competition and growth by
opening Italy’s so-called closed professions, including
notaries, lawyers and taxi drivers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
