Ukraineâ€™s farmers will plant corn
and sunflower on areas with damaged winter grain, according to
agriculture researcher ProAgro.  Farmers will need to re-seed about 2 million hectares of
winter grains, the researcher said in a statement e-mailed late
on Jan. 27. Another 300,000 hectares (741,316 acres) of winter
rapeseed will need to be re-planted.  Ukraine more than quadrupled its grain seed imports to
24,900 metric tons in the July 1 through December period,
compared with 5,500 tons a year earlier, the researcher said.
Corn accounted for more than 90 percent of all seed imports and
most of it came from Romania and  Hungary , ProAgro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
