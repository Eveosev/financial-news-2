Iran said it will install its first
20 percent nuclear fuel plates at the Tehran Research Reactor
within a month,  Tehran Times  reported, citing Foreign Minister
 Ali Akbar Salehi .  Western nations “did not imagine that we could achieve 20
percent enrichment and transform it into fuel plates,” Salehi
was quoted by the newspaper as saying in  Addis Ababa  yesterday,
on the sidelines of an African Union summit.  Iranian officials said the country began in 2010 processing
low enriched uranium to a 20 percent purity level as it needed
to secure fuel for its research reactor, which produces medical
isotopes for cancer patients. Enriched uranium can fuel a
reactor or, enriched to higher degrees, form the core of a bomb.  To contact the reporter on this story:
