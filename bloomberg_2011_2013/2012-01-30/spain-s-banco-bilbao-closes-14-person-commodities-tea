Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
has closed its team buying and selling commodities, a company
official said.  The team consisted of 14 people, and seven of these
employees will be transferred to other units at the Bilbao-based
bank, said the official, who declined to be identified, citing
company policy.  The bank is cutting 150 employees in its wholesale banking
division as it trims staffing in line with reduced business
levels, the company said on Dec. 8.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
