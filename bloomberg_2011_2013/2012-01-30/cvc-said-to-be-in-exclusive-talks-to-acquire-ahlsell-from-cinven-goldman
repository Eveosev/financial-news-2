CVC Capital Partners Ltd., the
buyout firm that owns Formula One, is in exclusive talks to buy
Ahlsell AB, a Swedish construction products supplier, four
people with knowledge of the talks said.  The firm has been granted four weeks by Ahlsell’s owners,
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Cinven Ltd., to complete the
financing of its bid, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private. A sale may raise about
1.5 billion pounds ($2.3 billion), the people said. Reuters
reported the talks earlier today.  CVC competed with the private equity firms Nordic Capital
Svenska AB, Bain Capital LLC and BC Partners Ltd. for the asset,
people with knowledge of the process said earlier this month.
Cinven and Goldman Sachs bought Stockholm-based Ahlsell in 2006
for 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion), according to  Cinven’s 
website.  Officials at Goldman Sachs, Cinven and CVC declined to
comment.  Ahlsell, which distributes heating and plumbing products
and other construction equipment in the Nordic region,  Russia 
and Eastern Europe, had revenue of 19.3 billion kronor ($2.9
billion) and earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of
1.25 billion kronor in 2010, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
