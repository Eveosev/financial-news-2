Japan ’s unemployment rate
unexpectedly rose last month as the strong yen continues to
squeeze manufacturers.  The jobless rate was 4.6 percent in December, the
statistics bureau said in Tokyo today. The median forecast of 30
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for the rate to remain
at 4.5 percent.  The government has approved four supplementary budgets
worth about 20 trillion yen ($262 billion) to stoke demand and
rebuild after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Those funds
are helping support the labor market, offsetting planned job
reductions at manufacturers including  NEC Corp. (6701)   “Labor offers in the devastated areas have been quite
strong, and this will continue to support the labor market.”
 Kiichi Murashima , chief economist at Citigroup Global Markets
Japan Inc. in Tokyo, said before the report. “Manufacturers
have become cautious about hiring people in the context of
global growth, the yen’s appreciation and uncertainty
surrounding electricity supply” stemming from the shutdown of
nuclear reactors since the disaster, he said.  Exporters are struggling with a yen hovering around a
record high against the dollar, which caused Japan to last year
post its first annual trade deficit since 1980. NEC said Jan. 26
it would eliminate 10,000 jobs, with 7,000 of those positions in
Japan.  The job-to-application ratio, which Murashima said he sees
as a “better” indicator given Japan’s aging population,
improved to 71 positions open for every 100 candidates from 69
in November, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
