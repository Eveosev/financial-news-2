OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , Russia’s natural-gas
export monopoly, said recovering demand in  Italy  and Turkey
drove an 8.2 percent increase in exports to Europe last year.  Exports to Turkey, the company’s second-biggest buyer
outside the former  Soviet Union , surged 44 percent to 26 billion
cubic meters, while supplies to Italy jumped 31 percent to 17.1
billion cubic meters, OAO Gazprom Export  said  today.  Shipments to  Germany  were little changed from the previous
year at 34 billion cubic meters.  Demand in Europe, Gazprom’s biggest market by revenue, is
recovering after a two-year slump when buyers turned to the  spot
market  for cheaper supplies than under Russian contracts.
Gazprom, facing competition and a persisting gap between its
long-term oil-linked gas prices and spot rates, agreed to lower
prices to five customers in late 2011 and early 2012.  Russian gas exports to  Europe  climbed to 150 billion cubic
meters last year, Chief Executive Officer Alexey Miller told
President  Dmitry Medvedev  on Jan. 11. Gazprom in June said
annual exports were expected to rise to at least 155 billion
cubic meters for the year, after saying in February that demand
may recover to a pre-crisis level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
