JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  started
marketing a sale of Samurai bonds, the first such offering by a
U.S. bank since the lender’s own a year ago.  The biggest U.S. bank will sell five-year fixed-rate bonds
yielding 80 basis points more than the yen swap rate, according
to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The sale is
slated for Feb. 2, the person said.  JPMorgan will also sell same-maturity floating-rate notes
yielding 95 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate for the yen, said the person, asking not
to be identified as the information is private.  The bank was the first U.S. financial borrower last year to
tap the yen market since the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in September 2008. JPMorgan on Feb. 15 raised
111.1 billion yen ($1.45 billion) in Samurai bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The sale was followed by Aflac Inc.
in June, and General Electric Capital Corp. in November, the
data show.  JPMorgan’s last Samurai offering included a 76.9 billion
yen sale of five-year 1.05 percent bonds priced to yield 25
basis points more than the yen swap rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield premium on the notes rose to
144.7 basis points above the yen swap rate on Dec. 1, before
falling to 114 today, according to Japan Securities Dealers
Association prices on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
