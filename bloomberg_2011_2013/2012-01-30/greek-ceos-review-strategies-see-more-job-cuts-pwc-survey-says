Most Greek chief executives are
reviewing their companies’ strategies and almost half see
further job cuts this year, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said.  Ninety percent of CEOs are reviewing their strategy and 54
percent made job cuts in the past 12 months, according to an e-
mailed statement from PwC’s Greek unit, which interviewed 45
Greek company chiefs between September and December as part of a
global survey. Forty-one percent expect more cuts in workforce
this year.  Both the figures for job cuts in the past 12 months and
expected future cuts were the highest for any country in the
euro region, PwC said. Eighty-two percent of CEOs said they were
unhappy with their tax burden in  Greece  and cited that as a
reason for turning to overseas markets.  Ninety-three percent of CEOs interviewed said they lacked
confidence in the government’s policies for handling the
economic crisis, compared with 85 percent in the year-earlier
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
