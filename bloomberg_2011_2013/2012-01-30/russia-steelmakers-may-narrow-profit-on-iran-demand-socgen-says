Russian steelmakers’ profits may be
hurt as  Iran ’s steel imports decline because of international
sanctions,  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  said.  Iran, which previously accounted for as much as 18 percent
of  Russia ’s steel export volumes, has cut purchases of Russian
and Kazakh semi-finished and finished products to about 40,000
metric tons a month, down more than 90 percent compared with
500,000 tons previously in a good month, the bank said, citing
Steel Business Briefing.  Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel  and  Evraz Plc (EVR)  stand to lose the
most, Sergey Donskoy, an analyst at Societe Generale, said in a
note. “If the situation gets worse, it will hit more or less
everyone to a different degree.”  Evraz doesn’t sell steel directly to Iran, said Tatyana
Drachuk, a spokeswoman for the steelmaker part-owned by
billionaire  Roman Abramovich . The press office of Magnitogorsk,
known as MMK, didn’t comment when called by Bloomberg.  The U.S and European Union have imposed sanctions against
the Persian Gulf country’s bank system in recent years to
increase pressure over its nuclear program. Separately, the EU
agreed this month to halt imports of Iranian crude starting in
July.  Iran has accounted for as much as 40 percent of MMK’s total
exports, and a halt to imports may force MMK to seek alternative
markets or cut production, Donskoy said. Other steelmakers may
be affected as the situation puts pressure on domestic prices
for long-products which are used in construction, Donskoy said
by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
