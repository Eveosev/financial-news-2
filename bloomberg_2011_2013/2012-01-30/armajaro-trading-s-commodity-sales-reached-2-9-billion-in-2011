Armajaro Trading Group Ltd., the
London-based supplier of sugar, cocoa and coffee, sold $2.9
billion in physical commodities in the year ended Sept. 30,
according to a filing to U.K. Companies House.  The company had a profit of $15.4 million in the 12-month
period, the filing submitted on Jan. 20 shows. Armajaro Trading
Group, led by Richard Ryan, chief executive officer, did not
provide comparative figures for the year earlier. The group was
created in May 2010 to absorb 100 percent of London-based
Armajaro Trading Ltd., with 15 percent spun off to management
and employees.  For the 17 months ended Sep. 30, sales totalled $3.8
billion and the profit was $24.3 million, according to the
filing. Company directors recommended transferring profit for
the period to the company’s reserves rather than paying a
dividend, the filing shows.  Armajaro’s value-at-risk, the maximum daily amount the
company estimated it could lose while maintaining a 95 percent
level of confidence, amounted to an average $2.5 million,
according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
