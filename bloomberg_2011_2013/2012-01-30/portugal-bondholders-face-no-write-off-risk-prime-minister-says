Portugal Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said there was no risk of investors being asked to take
losses on Portuguese debt.  “No, there is not,” Coelho said after being asked at a
news conference following a European Union summit in Brussels
about the risk of a possible private-sector involvement being
imposed on Portuguese debt holders.  “In fact at the European Council today the final statement
recalls the Greek situation is exceptional and unique,” he
said.  Portuguese bond yields rose to euro-era records today amid
concern a Greek debt writedown being negotiated with investors
may lead to a similar deal in Portugal. Coelho said both the
 International Monetary Fund  and the EU say Portuguese government
debt is “perfectly sustainable.”  He said  Portugal , which last year became the third euro-
area country to get a bailout from the EU and the IMF, plans to
return to markets in 2013. If external factors stop the country
from doing so, Coelho said both the IMF and the EU will continue
to “support our program.”  “The Portuguese economy deserves to be defended from the
contagion effect that originated outside the country,” he said.
“What matters the most at this time is that all the financial
stress is removed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
