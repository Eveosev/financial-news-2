The Philippine peso fell the most in
two weeks and  government bonds  rose after a report showed 
 economic growth  slowed in 2011 to half the previous year’s pace.   Gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 3.7
percent, the least since 2009, official data showed today.
Growth accelerated for a second straight quarter in the  three
months  ended December. The central bank has the flexibility to
further cut  interest rates , Economic Planning Secretary Cayetano
Paderanga said today, after policy makers lowered borrowing
costs on Jan. 19.  “The first quarter of 2012 is still filled with some
uncertainty, especially on the Europe front,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a senior currency analyst in Singapore at Malayan
Banking Bhd. “The Philippine trade performance shifted to the
downside in the second half of last year and the central bank
may have anticipated the weakness by cutting its benchmark
interest rate.”  The peso declined 0.3 percent to 42.975 per dollar at the
midday break in  Manila , the biggest drop since Jan. 16,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It earlier reached 42.720, the
strongest level since Oct. 28.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which reduced the overnight
borrowing rate to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent this month, will
be “appropriately accommodative of non-inflationary growth,”
Governor  Amando Tetangco  said in a mobile-phone message today.  “The BSP will assess the growth prospects of our major
trading partners and their impact on domestic growth and
inflation dynamics,” Tetangco said.  The Bureau of the Treasury will auction 9 billion pesos
($209 million) of 20-year bonds tomorrow. The yield on the 8.125
percent December 2035 notes fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 6.17 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
