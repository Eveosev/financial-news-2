Ghana ’s cedi gained to the highest
in three weeks against the dollar, as mining companies and non-
governmental organizations sold dollars.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest economy appreciated
as much as 1.7 percent to 1.6550 per dollar and traded at 1.6670
per dollar as of 12:56 p.m. in Accra, the capital. A close at
this level will be the highest since Jan. 10, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Companies that provide support services for mining
companies sold dollars today, as well as non-governmental
organizations to fund their activities this year,” Biggles Amponsah, a currency trader at the Ghanaian unit of Access Bank
Plc, said by phone. “I expect the cedi to continue to gain up
to at least Wednesday on the back of similar sales by
companies.”  Ghana is Africa’s second biggest gold producer after  South
Africa . Johannesburg-based  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AGA)  and Greenwood
Village Colorado-based Newmont Mining Corp. have mines in the
West African nation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
