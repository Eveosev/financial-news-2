A proposal by Australian mining
billionaire  Nathan Tinkler  to build a A$2.5 billion ($2.7
billion) coal export terminal on the nation’s east coast has
been rejected by the New South Wales government.  The site proposed by Tinkler is “more suited to handling
multi-product, container, general cargo and dry bulk terminal
freight,” Premier Barry O’Farrell said in a Jan. 28 statement.  Tinkler’s plan, through his closely held Hunter Ports Ltd.,
competed with Port Waratah Coal Services Ltd.’s A$5 billion
proposal to expand existing port facilities at Newcastle. Coal
exporters in Australia, the biggest exporter of the fuel, are
facing bottlenecks as railroads and ports have struggled to cope
with increased demand, resulting in regular queues of ships
waiting to load.  “The government will continue to build on the existing
industry-supported framework for the expansion of coal terminal
capacity,” O’Farrell said.  Tinkler,  Australia ’s youngest billionaire, last year lost
out in a bid to buy Queensland’s Abbot Point coal terminal,
which was sold to  India ’s Adani Group for A$1.8 billion.  The NSW government’s decision gave coal producers in the
region more certainty about a timely delivery of their future
coal export chain, Port Waratah’s Chief Executive Office Hennie
du Plooy said in a statement.  The port of Newcastle is located about 125 kilometers (70
miles) north-northeast of Sydney. It’s the world’s biggest
thermal coal port.  To contact the reporter on this story:
