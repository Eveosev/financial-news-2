Aviva Plc (AV/) , Britain’s second-biggest
insurer by market value, will cut 160 jobs at its asset
management unit as the European sovereign debt crisis and the
deteriorating U.K. economy crimp sales.  The insurer will scale back its funds that actively select
stocks to focus instead on its fixed income, real estate and so-
called multi-asset investment funds, Aviva said in a statement
today. The cuts, equivalent to 12 percent of Aviva Investors’
workforce, include the company’s London-based European, emerging
markets, global, and sustainable and responsible investments
equity desks. The insurer will retain its equity index team.  “The economic downturn has been the catalyst for a change
in client behavior across the asset management sector, with a
reduced appetite for riskier assets such as equities, notably in
 Europe ,” Aviva said.  The European debt crisis roiled investors last year,
prompting the  European Central Bank  to put in place a three-year
lending facility to shore up the region’s lenders in  December.
The MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks fell 7.6 percent last year, its
biggest annual drop since 2008. The decline included a 7.1
percent gain in the fourth quarter.  Aviva Investors’ funds under management declined to 263
billion pounds at the end of the third quarter from 269 billion
pounds at the end of June, hurt by declining markets and adverse
foreign-exchange movements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
