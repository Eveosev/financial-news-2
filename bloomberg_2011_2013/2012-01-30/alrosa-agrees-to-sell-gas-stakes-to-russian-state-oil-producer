OAO Alrosa,  Russia â€™s diamond mining
monopoly, agreed to sell stakes in three natural-gas and gas
condensate deposits in the Yamalo-Nenetsky region in Siberia to
OAO Zarubezhneft, a Russian state oil producer.  Zarubezhneft will help Alrosa develop the fields after
acquiring blocking stakes of more than 25 percent in the license
holders, ZAO Geotransgaz and OOO Urengoy Gas Co., the diamond
producer said today in an e-mailed statement. The companies are
working on valuing the assets, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
