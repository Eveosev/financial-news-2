Chile ’s industrial production
increased a slower-than-estimated 0.5 percent in December from a
year earlier while retail sales jumped 10.1 percent.  Industrial sales climbed 0.4 percent over the same period,
while supermarket revenue increased 6.1 percent, the National
Statistics Institute said in a report released today. The median
estimate of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for
industrial output to grow 1.2 percent in December.  The European sovereign-debt crisis has cut demand for
exports, while failing to damp inflation or retail sales.
Overall growth in the Andean nation is slowing toward a level
that is neutral for inflation, central bank board members said
in their Jan. 12 policy meeting.  “This deceleration may deepen,” according to minutes from
the meeting published on Jan. 27. “The transmission of the
international situation to Chile’s economy was a factor to
continue evaluating in coming months.”  Mining production increased 2.8 percent in December as
output of copper, Chile’s biggest export, climbed 2.2 percent
from a year ago to 509,407 metric tons, the institute said.  The peso weakened 0.8 percent to 488.25 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:15 a.m. Santiago time.  Chile’s economy will expand 3.75 percent to 4.75 percent
this year after climbing an estimated 6.2 percent in 2011, the
central bank said in forecasts published last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
