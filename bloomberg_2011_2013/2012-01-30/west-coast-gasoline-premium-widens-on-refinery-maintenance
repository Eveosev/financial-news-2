The premium for California-blend
gasoline in  Los Angeles  strengthened amid maintenance at West
Coast refineries that may crimp supplies.  Carbob (MOGLDB85)  increased 0.5 cent to a premium of 9 cents a gallon
against gasoline futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 4:05 p.m. East Coast time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  said in a notice with  California  regulators
last week that it would flare gases at its refinery in El
Segundo, California, today through Feb. 2. Alon US Energy Inc.
closed the 55,000-barrel-a-day  Paramount (PAPACRUD)  oil refinery in
 Southern California  for planned work that may last for a month,
according to two people familiar with the maintenance.  Carbob in  San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  narrowed 0.37 cent to a discount of
0.13 cent.  California-blend diesel in  Los Angeles (DIEILCAD)  fell 0.37 cent to a
premium of 1.38 cents against Nymex heating oil futures. The
same fuel in  San Francisco (DIEISCAD)  was unchanged at a discount of 1
cent.  The discount to futures for conventional, 87-octane
gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon , widened 2 cents to 10 cents a
gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
