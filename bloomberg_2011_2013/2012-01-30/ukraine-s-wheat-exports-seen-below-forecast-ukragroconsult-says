Ukraine’s wheat exports may come in
below earlier forecasts because shipments are slowing,
agricultural researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  “The wheat export rate is very weak,” Liza Malyshko, a
grain analyst at the Kiev-based researcher, said today by phone.
UkrAgroConsult said shipments may not exceed 6 million metric
tons in the marketing year ending June 30, down from a previous
forecast of 7.6 million tons.  This would bring the country’s wheat carryover stock to
about 7 million tons, which compares with annual domestic
consumption of 5 million tons, with another 1.3 million tons
used for seeds, Malyshko said.  Ukraine’s winter grains, most of which are wheat, failed to
sprout across 15 percent of areas as of Jan. 26, according to
the  Agriculture Ministry ’s data. The government expects the
winter wheat crop to fall to between 12 million tons and 16
million tons in 2012.  Ukraine’s wheat harvest rose by 32 percent last year to
22.3 million tons, according to state statistics office data.
The country was taxing its wheat exports with 9 percent duty
from July to Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
