French nitrogen-fertilizer shipments
fell 19 percent to the lowest in at least four years from July
through November, while phosphate and potassium deliveries also
dropped, national fertilizer-industry association Unifa said.  Nitrogen sales in  France , the European Union’s largest crop
grower, fell to 864,000 metric tons in the first five months of
the year begun July 1 from 1.06 million tons a year earlier,
Paris-based Unifa said in an e-mailed statement today.  France is the 27-nation EU’s biggest crop-nutrient user,
according to the International Fertilizer Industry Association.
French grain farmers typically buy fertilizer for next year’s
crop after most harvesting is done in September.  Potassium-fertilizer shipments in France fell 10 percent to
282,000 tons in the May-November period, while phosphate
deliveries slid 24 percent to 221,000 tons, Unifa said.  The association tracks nitrogen sales on the basis of a
year that starts July 1, while the marketing year for potassium
and phosphorus begins May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
