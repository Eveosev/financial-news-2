The forint weakened from a three-
month high on concern European Union leaders won’t be able to
resolve the region’s debt crisis as  Hungary  attempts to obtain a
bailout.  The currency of the European Union’s most indebted eastern
member depreciated as much as 0.9 percent and traded 0.4 percent
weaker at 295.05 per euro by the end of trading in Budapest,
after appreciating to 293.86 on Jan. 27, the strongest close
since October.  EU leaders gather for their first summit of 2012 today to
finalize a German-led deficit-control treaty and endorse the
statutes of a 500 billion-euro ($655 billion) rescue fund to be
set up this year. Hungary struggled to obtain a bailout after
the EU and the  International Monetary Fund  broke off talks on
aid, citing laws which threatened the independence of the
country’s central bank.  “The forint managed to strengthen substantially last week
because of the good international sentiment and the expectation
of an IMF bailout deal,”  Zoltan Arokszallasi, a Budapest-based
economist at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in an e-mailed report
today. “Today the picture is more gloomy,” Arokszallasi said,
citing reports on Greek rescue negotiations.  Hungarian Premier  Viktor Orban  sees it as “unimaginable”
to change the flat personal income tax regime to meet possible
IMF requests related to a loan, Magyar Nemzet reported at the
weekend, without citing anyone.  The BUX  index  of shares retreated 1.1 percent and the
country’s benchmark 5-year bonds slumped, lifting yields 15
basis points,or 0.15 percentage point, to 8.95 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
