Global soybean and corn output will
be lower than predicted last month because of dry weather in
 South America  caused by La Nina conditions, Rabobank
International said.  Soybean production will total 249.2 million metric tons in
the 2011-12 season and corn output will come to 854.6 million
tons, analysts including London-based Luke Chandler said in a
report today. That compares with December estimates of 258
million tons and 855.8 million tons. The bank raised forecasts
for prices of both crops.  “The dry weather is impacting the 2011-12 numbers,”
analyst Erin FitzPatrick, who co-authored the report, said by e-
mail.  Soybeans will average $12 a bushel in the current quarter,
above last month’s estimate of $11.78, Rabobank said. Corn will
average $6.25 a bushel, up from the previous $6.10, according to
the report.  China  is the biggest global soybean consumer and
ranks second for corn, while Argentina and  Brazil  are the
second- and third-largest shippers of both crops.  “There is increased upside risk to our price forecast
should South America’s supplies tighten further or China’s
demands increase above our expectations,” the analysts said.  USDA Estimate  Soybean output in Argentina will be the lowest in three
years at 47 million tons as dry weather persists due to a La
Nina system, Rabobank said. That’s less than the U.S. Department
of Agriculture’s 50.5 million-ton estimate. Yields will come to
2.5 tons of the oilseed a hectare (2.47 acres), down from 2.75
tons previously, the analysts said.  “ Argentina ’s soybean crop has been more negatively
affected by the drought, with production now expected to fall to
a three-year low,” Rabobank said. “The lower production is
directly subtracted from Argentina’s export availability.”  World soybean production will total 261.8 million tons in
the 2012-13 marketing year, below last month’s 264 million-ton
projection, the analysts said. Corn growers will harvest 884
million tons of the grain, less than the 884.5 million tons
predicted last month, according to the report.  Brazil’s soybean production will fall 4 percent to 71.5
million tons as dry weather cuts production, Rabobank said.  “There was a lack of rainfall in the south of Brazil
during the key pod-setting phase of early-maturing soybean
varieties,” the bank said. “As a result, we expect soybean
production in the states of Parana, Santa Catarina and  Rio
Grande  do Sul to decline.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
