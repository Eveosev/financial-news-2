The Liam Neeson action film “The
Grey” opened in first place in U.S. and Canadian cinemas,
taking in $19.7 million for Open Road Films, the distributor
founded last year by the three largest U.S. theater chains.  “One for the Money,” starring  Katherine Heigl , was third
in its first weekend, with $11.8 million, researcher
 Hollywood.com Box-Office  said today in an e-mailed statement.
“Man on a Ledge” was fifth in its debut with $8 million.  “The Grey” is Open Road’s second release, following
“Killer Elite” in September. Owned by  Regal Entertainment
Group (RGC) , AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and  Cinemark Holdings
Inc. (CNK) , the company was a response to shrinking output by major
studios. “The Grey” was expected to have sales of about $14.5
million, the estimate of BoxOffice.com.  “Regal and AMC can go back to Hollywood and say, ‘See,
these are the kinds of movies people want to see,’”  Jeff Bock ,
a box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations Co. in Los Angeles,
said in a telephone interview. “It’s a real coup for them that
they got Neeson for this role.”  The weekend also brought increased sales for a few films
that garnered Academy Awards nominations last week. “The
Artist,” nominated for best picture, recorded a 40 percent rise
in receipts.  “This film is pretty much the favorite to win the best
picture Oscar,” Phil Contrino, the editor of Boxoffice.com,
said in a telephone interview.  Sales more than doubled for “The Descendants,” also a
best-film contender.  ‘The Descendants’  Contrino said the improvement by “The Descendants,” which
was eighth with $6.4 million after expanding by 1,441 screens,
also was driven by the nominations.  “This is a great example of a movie building an audience
by word of mouth,” Contrino said.  George Clooney  is viewed as
the favorite to win the best actor award, he said.  From 2006 to 2010, best-picture winners on average had
$57.2 million in box-office sales heading into the nominations
and $42.9 million afterward, according to research by  Santa
Monica , California-based IbisWorld, an industry researcher.  ‘One for the Money’  First place’s “The Grey” features Neeson as the leader of
a group of oil-rig workers who are stranded in the Alaskan
wilderness after a plane crash. They are threatened by a pack of
wolves. Dermot Mulroney co-stars.  “Underworld: Awakening,” last weekend’s top film, fell to
second with sales of $12.4 million for  Sony Corp. (6758)  The movie, the
fourth film in the vampire-versus-werewolf series, has taken in
$45 million since it opened on Jan. 20.  “One for the Money,” distributed in the U.S. by  Lions
Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) , features Heigl as an out-of-work woman
who takes a job with a bail-bond company. Desperate for money,
she goes after the biggest bail jumper, a former police officer
accused of murder. Jason O’Mara and Daniel Sunjata co-star.  “Red Tails,” from  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Twentieth Century Fox, was
fourth with $10.4 million in receipts. The movie follows the
training and deployment of the first U.S. fighter squadron
staffed by black pilots at Tuskegee,  Alabama . The film stars
Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr.  “Man on a Ledge,” from Summit Entertainment LLC, stars
 Sam Worthington  as a police officer convicted of stealing a
famous diamond. After escaping custody, he stands on the ledge
of a New York high-rise in a plot to clear his name. Elizabeth
Banks co-stars.  Weekend revenue for the top 12 films rose 6.4 percent to
$98.3 million from a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Year to
date, revenue is up 12 percent and attendance 13 percent. The
