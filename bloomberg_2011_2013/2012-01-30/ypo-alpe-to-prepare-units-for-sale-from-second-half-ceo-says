Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International
AG, a nationalized Austrian lender, is preparing to sell its
banking units in Austria,  Italy  and the former  Yugoslavia  and
expects conditions for a deal to improve in the second half.  The bank, based in Klagenfurt, Austria, considers it “very
unrealistic” that it can agree a sale of its lenders in
Croatia,  Serbia ,  Slovenia , Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegowina
this year, Chief Executive Officer Gottwald Kranebitter told
journalists in Vienna today.  “We want to have completed our homework in the second half
of 2012,” Kranebitter said. “When we will start the sale
process and when we can sell, will be determined by the market.
We assume that in the second half of 2012 markets will calm
down” after  Europe ’s big banks have met new European capital
rules, he said.  Hypo Alpe is selling the banking units as the European
Commission continues to investigate whether its 2009 bailout was
illegal state aid.  Austria  took over the bank to avert its
collapse after former owners, including  Bayerische Landesbank  (BLGZ),
withdrew their support. The bank has had three annual losses in
as many years since 2008, totaling 3.2 billion euros ($4.2
billion).  Almost a third of its loan book  is overdue or in
default.  Hypo Alpe came “close to break-even” in 2011, Kranebitter
said. That comes after it reported its first half-year profit in
four years because bad debt charges declined 80 percent in the
six months to June 30, 2011. Net income in period was 71.6
million euros, compared with a loss of 498.9 million euros a
year earlier.  Hypo Alpe received 1.35 billion euros in state capital in
2009 and 2010, as well as a 200 million-euro guarantee. The
government wrote off 700 million euros of that in last year’s
budget. Hypo Alpe’s former shareholders BayernLB, the Austrian
province of Carinthia and insurer Grazer Wechselseitige AG also
injected 210 million euros of non-voting capital last year under
the deal in which Hypo Alpe was nationalized.  To contact the reporter on this story:
