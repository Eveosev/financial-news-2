The Paris commerce tribunal is
expected to announce today which bidder will take over French
financial daily La Tribune, the newspaper reported, as it
published its final paper edition.  There were two bids, the newspaper said. One is from
investment fund La Financiere Patrimoniale d’Investissement
(LFPI), which plans to publish only electronically. The other is
from regional press group France-Economie-Regions which also
plans a weekly, the newspaper said.  Either buyer is expected to reduce La Tribune’s workforce
by three-quarters, it reported.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
