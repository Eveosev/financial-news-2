Sierra Leone recorded a budget
deficit of 3 billion leones ($687,000) in October, down from a
surplus of 25 billion leones a month earlier, the Bank of Sierra
Leone said.  Total revenue, including grants, of 105.5 billion leones
was 21 percent less that a target of 134.3 billion leones and 31
percent lower than income in September, the Freetown-based bank
said in a monthly review published on its website today.  Foreign reserves fell 0.2 percent to $352.4 million in
October, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
