OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  and its partners in the
Sakhalin-2 project may decide on expanding their liquefied
natural gas plant this year, to add supplies by 2018, said
Andrey Galaev, the venture’s chief executive officer.  An expansion may cost $5 billion to $7 billion based on
preliminary estimates, Galaev told reporters today in Moscow.
Depending on changes in oil and gas prices, the construction
cost may drop as low as $3 billion or climb as high as $8
billion, he said.  A decision should be made this year to reach a window for
supplies in 2016 to 2018, before global LNG production capacity
rises, according to Galaev.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  holds 27.5 percent of the project
after agreeing to cede control of  Russia ’s first LNG plant to
Gazprom in 2006.  Mitsui & Co . has 12.5 percent and  Mitsubishi
Corp. (8058)  owns 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
