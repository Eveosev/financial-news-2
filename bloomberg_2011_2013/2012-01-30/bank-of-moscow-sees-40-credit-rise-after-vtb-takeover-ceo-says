Bank of Moscow  seeks to boost
lending by 40 percent this year after its takeover by VTB Group,
 Russia ’s second-largest lender, Chief Executive Officer Mikhail Kuzovlev said.  “It will be a very considerable growth, a much bigger one
than being forecast for the banking sector at 20 percent,”
Kuzovlev said in a Jan. 27 interview at the  World Economic Forum 
in Davos, Switzerland.  The bank has a credit portfolio of 340 billion rubles
($11.2 billion), excluding bad loans inherited from the previous
owners, and expects it to rise to as much as 480 billion rubles
by the end of 2012, said Kuzovlev.  Russian regulators agreed to provide a record 395 billion-
ruble bailout for Bank of Moscow in July after state-run VTB
bought the city government’s 46.5 percent stake in the lender
and uncovered bad debts.  Bank of Moscow, in which VTB now owns almost 95 percent,
also targets increasing its share of the banking market for
small and medium-sized businesses in Russia from 1.5 percent
currently to between 4 percent and 6 percent by 2015, Kuzovlev
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
