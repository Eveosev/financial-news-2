Gasoline fell for the first time in
five days on concern that Greek bailout negotiations will
falter, leading to a default and weakening the region’s economy.  Futures declined as European Union leaders prepared to meet
to discuss the credit crisis. They won’t complete  Greece ’s
second aid program today because debt talks with banks aren’t
over, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said.  “Should Greece default, the concern is that might lead to
instability in other countries and slowing economies that would
spread across Europe,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for February delivery fell 4.18 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.885 a gallon at 11:16 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  EU leaders are also awaiting a European-International
Monetary Fund assessment of Greece’s current needs and the
status of its economic reforms, Merkel told reporters before an
EU summit in Brussels today.  The euro fell for the first time in six days against the
dollar, losing 0.9 percent at 11:19 a.m. in  New York . A weaker
euro and stronger dollar reduce the investment appeal of
commodities.  February-delivery heating oil rose 0.4 cent to $3.0744 a
gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1
cent to $3.429 yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
