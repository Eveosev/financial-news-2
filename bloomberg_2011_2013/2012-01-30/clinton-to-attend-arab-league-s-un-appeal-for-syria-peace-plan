Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
will attend a United Nations  Security Council  meeting Jan. 31 to
show support for an Arab League plan to end the violence in
Syria, an Obama administration official said.  Clinton will push the 22-member group’s proposal for Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad to step down in favor of a national
unity government, according to the official, who was not
authorized to speak on the record.  The Security Council began talks on Jan. 27 on a new Arab-
European draft resolution to resolve the crisis, which has
claimed more than 5,000 lives since it began a year ago,
according to the UN. The draft faces strong opposition from
 China  as well as Russia, which has indicated it will not support
efforts to bring about regime change.  Syria  has rejected the proposal, saying it infringes on its
sovereignty.  To contact the reporters on this story:
