Greek bank deposits by businesses
and households rose in December for the first time since August
as the country’s political outlook stabilized with the formation
of an interim government under Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos .  Deposits increased to 174.2 billion euros ($228 billion)
from 172.9 billion euros the previous month, a rise of 0.75
percent, according to a statement by the  Bank of Greece  on its
website today. Deposits declined 35.4 billion euros, or 17
percent, in 2011.  Deposits shrank 8.3 percent in the three months to November
as the country fell short of targets under a European Union and
International Monetary Fund fiscal program, leading to agreement
on a second Greek financing package at an EU summit on Oct. 26.
Papademos’s appointment on Nov. 11 stemmed the deposit outflow
after his predecessor,  George Papandreou , roiled markets by
calling a referendum on the plan.  “The outlook remains fragile and macro and political
developments, as well as the depth of recession, will drive
deposit evolution in the coming months,”  Euroxx Securities SA (EX) 
research director Manos Giakoumis said in an e-mailed note.  Greek bank lending to households and businesses fell an
annual 3.2 percent in December, according to a separate
statement from the central bank today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
