David Cameron , who found himself
isolated in the European Union after refusing to back a treaty
to enshrine fiscal discipline last month, drew criticism from
his own lawmakers for retreating from his position.  The prime minister told reporters following an EU summit in
Brussels yesterday that Britain will allow  European institutions 
including the  European Court  of Justice to be used to enforce
new fiscal rules in the euro region.  Cameron will have to explain that in Parliament in London
today to rank-and-file members of his  Conservative Party , who
cheered him in December when he forced other EU nations to forge
ahead with their own agreement and vowed to resist the use of EU
institutions to underpin it. Cameron said yesterday he will be
“watching like a hawk” to see the new arrangements don’t
threaten British interests.  “There isn’t an EU treaty, because I’ve vetoed it,”
Cameron said. “We’re not in this treaty, we’re not part of it,
we don’t ratify it. The EU institutions are already used in
other settings we’re not involved in. Our national interest is
that these countries get on and sort out the mess that is the
euro.”  The leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament,
Martin Callanan, accused Cameron of giving way to his Liberal
Democrat deputy,  Nick Clegg . “I blame a combination of
appeasing Nick Clegg, who is desperate to sign anything the EU
puts in front of him, and the practical reality that this pact
is actually quite hard to prevent,” Callanan said in an e-
mailed statement.  ‘Fundamental Change’  Tory lawmaker Bernard Jenkin said the euro region was
embarking on fiscal union “in the full expectation that the EU
institutions will do their bidding,” nullifying the U.K. veto.  “This is a fundamental change in the nature of the EU,
where a veto counts for nothing and highlights how the terms of
U.K. membership of the EU are becoming ever more unacceptable,”
he said in an e-mail.  EU leaders yesterday completed the fiscal-discipline
treaty, which speeds sanctions on high-deficit states and
requires European governments to anchor balanced-budget rules in
national law. Eight countries outside the euro backed the pact,
leaving Britain and the  Czech Republic  to boycott it.  Cameron broke ranks with French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  last month after he failed
to secure guarantees of a British veto right over future
financial regulations. Cameron called them a threat to London’s
standing as  Europe ’s leading financial center.  Lethal Issue  Cameron said at the time that any changes made under the
alternative fiscal pact could not use EU institutions because
they could only carry out policies applying to all 27 members.  Europe has been a lethal issue for Conservative prime
ministers since at least 1990, when it led to  Margaret Thatcher ’s downfall over her refusal to agree to a timetable for
joining the single currency. Her successor,  John Major , found
his leadership undermined by euro-skeptics on his own side.  Cameron attempted to laugh off speculation of a rift with
Sarkozy after the French president told reporters Jan. 29 that
Britain “doesn’t have any industry,” a comment he refreshed
yesterday when he said  France ’s decision to develop industry as
well as finance “aligns us more with our German friends than
our British friends.” The two men exchanged a brief handshake
upon arrival in Brussels.  “Every now and again he says something I don’t agree
with,” Cameron said. “We actually have a larger industrial
sector than France, but I’m going to gloss over that.”  He attacked Sarkozy’s plan for a financial-transactions
tax. “In the spirit of this healthy competition with France, if
France goes for a financial-transactions tax then the door will
be open and we’ll be able to welcome many more French banks and
businesses to the U.K. and we’ll expand our economy in that
way,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
