Indian Energy Ltd. (IEL)  and Trishe
Developers Pvt. agreed to develop as much as 1,000 megawatts of
wind farms in stages as the South Asian nation seeks to boost
its clean energy production.  Trishe will develop the projects and sell them to Indian
Energy subject to “development milestones,” Indian Energy
Managing Director Rupert Strachwitz said in an e-mail.  The agreement is one of the largest announced in  India ,
behind a 2,000-megawatt deal struck by Mytrah Energy Ltd. and
 Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM)  last May. India expects to add 2,400
megawatts of new wind capacity in the financial year ending in
March as part of a target to have 15 percent of its electricity
generated from clean sources by 2020.  The turbines will be supplied by “various” manufacturers,
Strachwitz said, without giving details.  Indian Energy and Trishe expect about 300 megawatts to be
completed in 2013, 350 megawatts in 2014 and the remainder by
2016, Strachwitz said. The projects will be built in  Tamil Nadu ,
Karnataka and Maharashtra states.  Infrastructure India Plc (IIP) , an  investment company  based in
the Isle of Man, bought Indian Energy in September, according to
filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
