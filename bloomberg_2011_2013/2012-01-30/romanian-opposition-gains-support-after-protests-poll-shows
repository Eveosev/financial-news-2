Romania ’s two main opposition
parties gained increased public support over the current ruling
party, according to a survey conducted by pollster IMAS during
the most violent anti-government protests in more than a decade.  The opposition Social-Liberal Union, formed by the Social
Democrats and the  Liberals , would win 53.4 percent of the vote
in a general election, an increase from 48 percent in a December
poll, showed the IMAS poll  published  by the Bucharest-based
newspaper Adevarul today.  The ruling  Liberal Democratic Party  would get 15.8 percent
of the vote from 21 percent last month, the survey showed. The
 People’s Party , newly-founded by media owner Dan Diaconescu,
would garner 13.9 percent, compared with 12 percent in the
previous poll, while the Democratic Union of Hungarians in
Romania, an ethnic minority party which is part of the current
governing coalition, would win about 6 percent of the votes.  Romanian Prime Minister Emil Boc’s government, supported by
a governing coalition, has been grappling with widespread
protests for some two weeks in January ahead of general
elections scheduled later this year. People took to the streets
across the country to protest against an austerity budget,
demanding early elections. The protests turned violent on Jan.
14 and Jan. 15, injuring 60 people.  The survey of 1,039 people was taken from Jan. 11 to Jan.
17 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
