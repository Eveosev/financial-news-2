Valuations for U.S. equities have
been stuck below the five-decade average for the longest period
since  Richard Nixon ’s presidency, a sign investors don’t trust
earnings even after a three-year bull market.  Analysts  estimate profits  in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index will reach a record $104.78 this year after increasing 125
percent since the end of 2009, the fastest expansion in a
quarter century, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
American companies are boosting income so much that even after
stocks doubled, the  S&P 500  hasn’t traded above its 16.4 mean
ratio for 446 days, the longest stretch since the 13 years
beginning in 1973.  Battered by the 14 percent decline in the S&P 500 since
2000, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and
the so-called flash crash 21 months ago, investors are staying
away from stocks, even after record profits, 10 quarters of  U.S.
economic growth  and promises by the  Federal Reserve  to keep
interest rates near zero through 2014. Of the $37 trillion
erased from global equities in the credit crisis, $24 trillion
has been restored.  “After two significant bear markets, the flash crash and
the lost decade, many have simply said, ‘No mas,’” Howard Ward,
who helps oversee $35 billion at Gamco Investors Inc. in Rye,
 New York , said in an e-mail on Jan. 24. “Of course, bull
markets have a history of climbing a wall of worry. And it is
happening again.”  Weekly Gain  The Fed’s pledge to keep  interest rates  low through 2014
helped send the S&P 500 up 0.1 percent to 1,316.33 last week and
extended its 2012 advance to 4.7 percent, the best start to a
year since 1989. At the same time, an average of 6.69 billion
shares traded on U.S. exchanges in the 50 days ended Jan. 18,
the fewest since at least 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The equity index slipped 1 percent to 1,303.81 at
9:32 a.m. New York time.  The S&P 500 trades for 13.7 times profits. It was last
above the mean valuation since 1954 on May 13, 2010, less than a
week after $862 billion was erased from U.S. equity values in 20
minutes, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The slump has
surpassed the two longest periods of the last quarter century,
in 2008 and 1988.  Profits for the 169 companies in the S&P 500 that reported
earnings since Jan. 9 have risen 3.2 percent from a year earlier
and beat analyst projections by 2.9 percent, the data show.
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in Cupertino,  California , the world’s biggest
technology company, Providence, Rhode Island-based defense
contractor  Textron Inc. (TXT)  and 110  other companies  posted higher-
than-forecast earnings in the three months ending Dec. 31.  Earnings, GDP  Companies in the S&P 500  earned $657 billion in the first
nine months of 2011, including $225.2 billion between April and
June, the most for any quarter in at least 12 years. That’s 72
percent more than the comparable period in 2008. U.S. GDP, which
grew at a slower-than-forecast 2.8 percent rate in the fourth
quarter, totals about $13.4 trillion, data compiled by Bloomberg
and the Commerce Department show.  “Corporate America is extremely lean, extremely efficient
at this time,”  Peter Sorrentino , a senior  fund manager  who
helps oversee $14.5 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati, said in a Jan. 27 phone interview. “You can
accumulate these stocks at attractive  valuations. (SPX) ”  The last two times the S&P 500 slumped below its historic
average,  equities  rallied. The benchmark index is up 42 percent
since it climbed above the five-decade mean in June 2009. It
spent 14 months below the average level from August 1988 through
October 1989 before quadrupling within eight years starting in
October 1990, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Peak Multiple  Multiples for the benchmark gauge rose as high as 13.82
this year. Should earnings match analyst forecasts and climb to
$104.78 a share, the index would have to reach 1,718.39 to trade
at the average ratio of 16.4, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s more than 30 percent above its last close.  The  U.S. economy  has expanded by an average of 2.4 percent
a quarter since 2009. While that helped push the S&P 500 up 95
percent, the index’s price-earnings multiple is down 43 percent.
The decline is part of a decade-long retreat in U.S. equity
valuations since the S&P 500 peaked at 31.2 times earnings in
December 1999.  “That is not a sign of optimism, bullishness or
exuberance,”  Hank Smith , chief investment officer at Haverford
Trust Co. in Radnor, Pennsylvania, said in a telephone
interview. His firm manages about $6.5 billion. “It’s a sign of
fear and anxiety.”  Stocks Versus Bonds  Investor doubts helped send new equity sales by U.S.
companies down 4 percent in 2011 as  interest rates  near record
lows spurred companies to issue bonds instead. U.S. corporate
debt sales rose 0.9 percent to $1.19 trillion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Customers of U.S. stock mutual funds have pulled out more
than $146 billion since May 2010 as the S&P 500’s valuation
shrunk by as much as 33 percent.  The longest valuation slump lasted from June 1973 through
January 1986, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The start
coincided with the Watergate scandal that led to Nixon’s
resignation and the Arab oil embargo, marking the end of a
three-year bull market as shares declined 32 percent over 16
months.  The U.S. economy contracted three of the four quarters in
1974, consumer prices climbed 12.3 percent in December and
 unemployment  reached 9 percent in May of the following year.
Gross domestic product shrank 5.1 percent from the fourth
quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009, according to the
Commerce Department.  ‘Extraordinary Long Time’  “One reason why the S&P 500’s P/E has been so low is the
fact that it has taken an extraordinarily long time for the GDP
to reach its pre-recession level,” said Komal Sri-Kumar, the
Los Angeles-based chief global strategist at TCW Group Inc.,
which oversees about $120 billion. As in the 1970s, “we have a
situation today which is also a structural change,” he said in
an interview on Jan. 26.  Analysts say the current slump is different from the one
that started more than 38 years ago. Equities face less
competition from fixed-income investments and inflation compared
with the 1970s and 1980s. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note
peaked at a record 15.84 percent on Sept. 30, 1981. The  consumer
price index  surged during the oil crisis in 1973, rising from
2.7 percent in June of 1972 to 12.3 by the end of 1974. It
peaked at 14.8 percent in March 1980.  All-Time Low  Today, the  10-year yield  is 1.89 percent and touched an
all-time low of 1.67 percent four months ago. Consumer prices
increased 3 percent from the previous year in December,
according to Labor Department data.  “In the 1970s, low P/Es were accompanied by high inflation
and high interest rates,” Nick Sargen, chief investment officer
at Fort Washington Investment Advisors in Cincinnati, which
oversees $40 billion, said in a Jan. 27 e-mail. “That’s
obviously not the case today, where the culprit is uncertainty
about the global economy and financial system.”  Cigna Corp. (CI) ’s annual profit has risen 16.5 percent a year
on average for the last two years. Shares of the fifth-largest
U.S. health insurer are  trading at  8.1 times reported earnings,
compared with the 24.4 average since 1991. Bloomfield,
Connecticut-based Cigna has returned an average 22 percent in
the 12 months after its multiple climbed back to the mean in the
past, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Natural Gas  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  climbed above its 14.2 average price-
earnings ratio on Dec. 23, the first time it’s risen higher than
the average since July 27, 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. While the  Juno Beach , Florida-based  natural gas  company
missed  profit estimates  by 6.3 percent in the third quarter, it
posted a 16 percent increase in earnings when it reported
fourth-quarter results on Jan. 27.  “The U.S. environment looks quite good both economically
and in terms of earnings,”  Hayes Miller , who helps oversee
about $46 billion as the Boston-based head of asset allocation
in  North America  at Baring Asset Management Inc., said in a Jan.
25 phone interview. “It’s going to be a long clean-up, but we
do expect markets to be up this year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
