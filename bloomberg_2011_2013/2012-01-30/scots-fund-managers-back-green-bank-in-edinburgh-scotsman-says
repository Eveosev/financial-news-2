Scotland ’s largest fund management
companies have urged the U.K. government to site its proposed
Green Investment Bank in Edinburgh, the Scotsman said, citing a
letter to Business Secretary Vince Cable.  The chief executive officers at  Aberdeen Asset Management
Plc (ADN) , Standard Life Investments, Baillie Gifford & Co., Kames
Capital, Martin Currie Investment Management Ltd. and Artemis
Investment Management LLP told Cable their firms had thrived in
Edinburgh due to the city’s ability to attract and retain people
with high levels of investment experience, the Edinburgh-based
newspaper said.  The government is expected to make a decision on the
location of the bank, which is being established with 3 billion
pounds of public funding, in the next few weeks with final
submissions having to be submitted by today, the Scotsman said.
The choice is likely to be between Edinburgh and  London , the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
