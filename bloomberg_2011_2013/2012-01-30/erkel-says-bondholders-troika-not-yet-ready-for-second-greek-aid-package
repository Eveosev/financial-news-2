European leaders won’t finalize
 Greece ’s second aid program today because talks with banks over
debt reduction aren’t completed, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said.  Leaders are also awaiting a European-International Monetary
Fund assessment of Greece’s current needs and the status of its
economic reforms, Merkel told reporters before a European Union
summit in Brussels today.  “We won’t have a thorough discussion of Greece because the
troika is in Greece and we don’t have a result of the talks with
the banks,” Merkel said.  The summit will clear away the “last questions” over a
planned deficit-control treaty that ensures German-style
balanced-budget provisions to prevent a repeat of the crisis,
she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
