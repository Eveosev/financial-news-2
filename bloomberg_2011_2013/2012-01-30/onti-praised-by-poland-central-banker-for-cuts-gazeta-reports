Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
austerity policies will increase the country’s competitiveness
and create jobs, Polish central bank Governor Marek Belka told
Gazeta Wyborcza.  “Mario Monti is the hero of modern  Europe ,” Belka said in
an interview with the  daily newspaper  published today. He said
it was “courageous” to raise the retirement age and open so-
called closed professions. “Monti is carrying out reforms that
have huge significance for the Italian economy,” he said.  “It’s easy to say now that Europe should have taken care
of faster economic growth two years ago, and it would have been
better to carry out indispensable reforms 10 years ago,” he
said, according to the newspaper. “It didn’t happen, and so
they have to be introduced now. It’s not too late for Italy or
 Spain , but for Greece it might be.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
