Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped on
speculation economic data signaling a slowdown in the region
will deter global investors from buying local assets.  Government
bonds  advanced.  The currency fell for a second day after  Fitch Ratings 
downgraded five countries including Italy and  Spain  on Jan. 28.
Asian stocks slipped from a three-month high before government
reports this week that economists predict will show Indonesia’s
exports rose by the least in more than two years in December and
manufacturing in  China  contracted this month.  “The central bank doesn’t want the rupiah to weaken too
much which could add to the inflation problem,” said Taufan
Tito, a currency trader in Jakarta at Bank Rakyat Indonesia.
“For now, we see more buyers for rupiah closer to 8,900 than
8,500 levels” given the slowdown concerns, he said.  The rupiah weakened 0.2 percent to 9,005 per dollar as of
3:25 p.m. in Jakarta, paring this year’s gain to 0.7 percent,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The
Jakarta Composite Index of stocks slumped 2.2 percent, the most
in almost three months.  Exports from  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy rose 4.1
percent last month from a year earlier, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, versus an 8.3 percent gain
in November. The report is due Feb. 1. It would be the smallest
gain since September 2009.  Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent this month from a year
earlier, versus 3.79 percent in December, a separate survey
showed before a government report Feb. 1. The government’s plan
to limit the sale of subsidized fuel in April may stoke prices,
Tito said.  Bond Index  The yield on the 7 percent note maturing in May 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.63 percent,
according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.
The rate has declined 47 basis points this month.  The government plans to sell Islamic bonds maturing in 2018,
2022 and 2027 tomorrow as well as regular notes maturing 2036 to
help finance its development spending, according to its sale
 calendar .  Barclays Capital  said Indonesia’s dollar bonds will qualify
for inclusion into the bank’s Global Aggregate Index from
tomorrow after the nation was upgraded to investment grade by
Moody’s Investors Service on Jan. 18.  The index tracks the performance of 13,529 securities
worldwide, and is benchmarked by money managers with $1.5
trillion of assets, the bank estimated. Indonesia has 25
outstanding dollar bond issues with total face value of $22.1
billion, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
