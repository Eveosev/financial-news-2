The Bovespa stock index fell for a
second day as raw material producers followed commodities prices
lower amid renewed concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will damp
global growth.  Petrochemicals maker  Braskem SA (BRKM5)  led declines by producers
and oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  sank to a one-week low as
crude fell. Banks  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  and  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) 
slumped after each was cut to “neutral” from “overweight” at
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Bovespa index slid 0.2 percent to 62,770.01 at the
close of trading in  Sao Paulo , the most since Jan. 13. Thirty-
eight stocks dropped on the gauge, while 31 gained. The real
weakened 0.7 percent to 1.7488 per  U.S. dollar . The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials fell 0.7 percent.  European leaders won’t finalize  Greece ’s second aid program
today because talks with banks over debt reduction aren’t
completed, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said. Greek Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos rejected reports of plans to
appoint a commissioner, citing “national dignity.”  “Again the focus is on Greece, and we’ll keep talking
about this same issue over and over until some solution comes
up,” Fausto Gouveia, who helps manage about 250 million reais
($143 million) at Legan Administracao de Recursos, said by phone
from Sao Paulo. “Stocks linked to commodities end up suffering
the most with all this uncertainty.”  Oil dropped for a second day, while the  Bloomberg Base
Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index  retreated 1.2 percent.  Petrobras fell 0.4 percent to 24.57 reais. Braskem slid 2.8
percent to 15.46 reais.  Steelmakers followed metals lower.  Cia. Siderurgica

declined 0.7 percent to 16.74 reais.  Bradesco, Itau Sink  Bradesco sank 1.6 percent to 32.42 reais. Itau declined 1.7
percent to 35.50 reais. Investors should move out of these
stocks into smaller banks including  Banco do Estado do Rio
Grande do Sul SA , JPMorgan’s analysts including  Saul Martinez 
wrote in a note to clients, citing valuation. Banrisul, as Banco
do Estado is known, trades at 9.3 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, cheaper than the ratio of 11.1 times for Bradesco,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Banrisul rose 1.2 percent to 20.55 reais, the second-best
performer today on the MSCI Brazil/Financials  index .  Brazil Inflation  Brazil’s broadest price index rose less than economists
forecast in January. The  IGP-M index  of wholesale, construction
and consumer prices climbed 0.25 percent from December, the
Getulio Vargas Foundation said on its website today. The median
estimate of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for an
increase of 0.30 percent.  The Bovespa has advanced 11 percent this year, buoyed by
 Brazil ’s interest-rate cuts, signs of growth in the U.S. and
renewed optimism Europe may be closer to solving its debt
crisis. The gauge trades at 10 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, in line with the ratio for the MSCI Inc.’s measure of
21 developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge sank 18 percent
in 2011.  Traders  moved  6.07 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo

daily average of 6.49 billion reais in 2011, according to data
from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
