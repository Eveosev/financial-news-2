Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s
second-largest lender, will record an after-tax charge of C$153
million ($152.7 million) in the fiscal first quarter related to
litigation costs.  The expense equals about 17 cents a share, the Toronto-
based bank said today in a statement.  The charge is related to litigation involving disbarred
Florida attorney Scott Rothstein, who admitted running a $1.2
billion  Ponzi scheme , Maria Leung, a bank spokeswoman, said in a
phone interview. Toronto-Dominion lost a $67 million jury
verdict this month over an investor group’s claims that it
helped Rothstein by telling victims their money was safe as he
depleted accounts.  “As a result of recent adverse judgments, the bank has
taken prudent steps to re-assess its litigation reserve,”
Toronto-Dominion said in the statement. The bank said it will
consider all options including appeal and intends to defend
itself “vigorously” in all cases,  Toronto-Dominion is scheduled to report first-quarter
results March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
