U.S. Steel Corp. (X) , the nation’s
largest producer of the metal by volume, will take a loss of
$350 million to $400 million in the first quarter on its planned
sale of a plant back to the Serbian government.  The total charge will be as much as $450 million, including
about $50 million from a foreign-exchange adjustment related to
its Serbian investments, the Pittsburgh-based company said in a
statement today. The amount attributable to the plant sale was
confirmed by Erin DiPietro, a company spokeswoman, in an e-mail
today.  Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said Jan. 27 that
the government would repurchase the plant for $1 and start
looking for another buyer. U.S. Steel bought the unit from the
government for about $23 million in September 2003. The company
said it will sell the plant for a “nominal” sum in a deal
expected to close tomorrow.  Increasing demand from automakers and energy companies has
helped raise steel  prices  in the U.S. in the past two months.
Steel consumption this year will increase 5.2 percent in the
U.S. this year and 2.5 percent in the European Union, with
demand stalling in most European countries, the Brussels-based
World Steel Association said in its October Short Range  Outlook .  U.S. Steel, which is scheduled to report fourth-quarter
earnings tomorrow,  fell  3.8 percent to $28.73 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
