Stocks slipped, sending the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index lower for a third day, Treasuries rose and
the euro weakened as  Greece  tangled with European officials over
terms of a second rescue package. U.S. equities  pared losses  as
Apple Inc. led a rally in  technology shares .  The  S&P 500  fell 0.3 percent to 1,313.01 at 4 p.m. in New
York, trimming an earlier drop of 1.2 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  dropped 6.74 points to 12,653.72 after losing

expects an accord in the next few days. Greek Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos yesterday fended off calls that a European
Union commissioner be appointed to oversee the nation’s budget.
EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  posted on Twitter that 25 EU
states agreed to join a fiscal compact at a summit today and
leaders endorsed the statutes of the permanent rescue fund.  “We’re working our way through the EU debt crisis, but
it’s happening slowly, in fits and starts,”  Alan Gayle , a
senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond,
 Virginia , which oversees about $47 billion, said in a telephone
interview.  Losses Trimmed  Stocks also trimmed losses as the  Federal Reserve  said
demand for business loans increased in the fourth quarter as
economic growth accelerated. According to a survey of senior
loan officers at banks, 17 of 56 banks reported stronger demand
among companies with $50 million in annual sales or more,
according to the survey released today in  Washington , while six
reported weaker demand. Demand among small businesses for loans
increased by the most in any quarter since 2005.  Bank of America Corp .,  Procter & Gamble Co . and American
Express Co. fell more than 1.4 percent to lead losses in the
Dow. Financial and energy companies were the biggest drag on the
 S&P 500  among 10 groups. Technology and telephone shares
advanced, as Apple and Verizon Communications Inc. climbed more
than 1 percent to pace gains.  Bank of America  decreased 3 percent after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut its recommendation. Halliburton Co. and Alcoa
Inc. dropped more than 1 percent as commodity prices slumped.

straight weekly gain, its longest  streak  since October. U.S.
consumer spending stalled in December, with purchases little
changed after rising 0.1 percent the prior month, Commerce
Department figures showed. The S&P 500 started the session
trading at 13.7 times reported earnings.  Valuations for U.S. equities have been stuck below the
five-decade average for the longest period since Richard Nixon’s
presidency, a sign investors don’t trust earnings even after a
three-year bull market.  Analysts estimate  profits  in the S&P 500 will reach a
record $104.78 this year after increasing 125 percent since the
end of 2009, the fastest expansion in a quarter century,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. American companies are
boosting income so much that even after stocks doubled, the S&P
500 hasn’t traded above its 16.4 mean ratio for 447 days, the
longest stretch since the 13 years beginning in 1973.  Earnings  topped  analysts’ estimates at about two-thirds of
the 170 companies in the S&P 500 that reported results since

appointed by euro-member states, with power to veto budget
decisions by Greece as a condition of a 130 billion-euro bailout
for  Athens , the Financial Times said, citing a copy of the
proposal.  ‘Identity and Dignity’  “Our partners acknowledge that European integration is
based on the institutional equality of nation-states and on
respect for their national identity and dignity,” Venizelos
said in an e-mailed statement from his office in Athens
yesterday. “Whoever poses a dilemma between economic aid and
national dignity is ignoring basic historical lessons.”  The euro weakened against 14 of 16 major peers,
depreciating 1.2 percent against the yen and slipping 0.6
percent versus the Canadian dollar.  Italian bonds decreased, sending the extra yield investors
demand to hold the securities instead of benchmark bunds 26
basis points higher to 430 basis points, or 4.30 percentage
points. France auctions as much as 8.3 billion euros of bills
maturing from 84 to 343 days.  EU leaders gathered in Brussels today for their first
summit of 2012 to put the finishing touches on a German-led
deficit-control treaty and endorse a 500 billion-euro ($661
billion) rescue fund to be set up this year. Greece and its
private creditors said Jan. 28 they expect to complete a
restructuring deal in coming days after bondholders signaled
they would accept a bigger cut in their debt holdings.  Bond Sales  European nations including Italy, Belgium and Spain sell no

being contained. The Spanish two-year note yield jumped 10 basis
points today to 2.63 percent, with the equivalent Portuguese
yield up 383 basis points to 21.01 percent.  Portugal’s 10-year bond yield climbed 217 basis points to a
euro-era record 17.39 percent. The cost of credit-default swaps
insuring $10 million of Portuguese sovereign debt for five years
rose to a record $4.25 million in advance and $100,000 annually,
according to CMA prices at 2:30 p.m. in  London , amid concern
investors will have to take losses in the wake of a Greek debt
deal. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments climbed 9.4 basis points to 332.75.  Copper fell the most in three weeks, losing 1.6 percent to
$3.8265 a pound in  New York  on speculation prices rose too high
when markets were shut in  China  last week. China is the biggest
user of the metal. Oil in New York slipped 0.8 percent to $98.78
a barrel. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities decreased 0.8
