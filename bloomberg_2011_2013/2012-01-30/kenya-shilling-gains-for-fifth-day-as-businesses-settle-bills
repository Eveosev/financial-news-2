Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for
the fifth day, the longest winning streak in more than two
months, as supply was curbed by businesses settling their month-
end bills.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.5 percent and was trading 0.3 percent stronger at
84.78 per dollar at 1:08 p.m. in the capital Nairobi.  “The shilling is gaining against the dollar on account of
tight liquidity in the money market as businesses settle their
monthly obligations,” John Muli a dealer at Nairobi-based
African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview. “With the
interbank rate rising the  market sentiment  is on a stronger
shilling and we expect it to trade within the 83.50 to 84.50
range,” he said.  Kenya’s central bank did not receive any bids for its 1
billion shilling ($11.8 million), 7-day  repurchase agreements 
offer, an official who declined to be identified in line with
the bank’s policy said in a phone interview in Nairobi today.
The average  interbank rate  increased to 19.25 percent last week,
from 15.99 percent, the central bank said in its weekly bulletin
on Jan 27.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened on increased dollar demand
from oil and manufacturing companies. The currency of the
second-biggest economy in East Africa depreciated as much as 0.3
percent to 1,603.30 and was trading 0.1 percent weaker at 1,600
at 1:05 p.m.  “There is demand coming in from oil and manufacturing
importers,” Fred Siwale, a dealer with CRDB Bank Plc said by
phone from Dar es Salaam, the commercial Capital.  Uganda’s shilling strengthened for a second day, rising 0.1
percent to 2,340 per dollar, the highest since April 13 on a
closing basis.  -- With assistance from David Malingha Doya in  Dar es Salaam
