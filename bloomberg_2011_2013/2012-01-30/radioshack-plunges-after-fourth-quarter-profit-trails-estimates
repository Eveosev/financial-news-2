RadioShack Corp. (RSH)  plunged in extended
trading after the consumer-electronics retailer suspended share
repurchases and reported preliminary fourth-quarter earnings
that trailed analysts’ estimates.  RadioShack  declined  19 percent to $8.30 at 5:18 p.m. in  New
York  after the markets closed. The shares dropped 47 percent
last year.  Suspending stock buybacks “for the near term” will enable
Radio Shack to spend on its businesses including mobility, Chief
Executive Officer Jim Gooch said today in a statement. The chain
also plans to continue paying a quarterly dividend.  The company bought back $11.9 million of shares in the
fourth quarter. It had cash of about $590 million as of Dec. 31,
compared with $569 million a year earlier. It plans to report
full-year results Feb. 21.  Earnings probably fell to 11 cents to 13 cents a share last
quarter, RadioShack said. Analysts projected 37 cents, the
average of 19  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. It projected
lower net income in 2012, compared to analysts’ estimates.  The company cited “underperformance” in the  Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S)  wireless business. The quarterly results were also hurt by
promotions during the holiday period and “ongoing pressures”
on  consumer spending , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
