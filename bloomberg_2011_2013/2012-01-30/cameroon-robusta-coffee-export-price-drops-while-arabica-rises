Prices for robusta exports from
 Cameroon , central  Africa ’s biggest coffee producer, declined in
the week through Jan. 29 while rates for arabica beans rose,
according to the nation’s Cocoa and Coffee Board.  The average export price for robusta, which is used in
instant coffee and espresso, decreased to 858  CFA francs  ($1.70)
a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 859 francs a week earlier, Richard
Adzogo, an official at the Douala-based board’s information
department, said in a mobile-phone text message today.  A kilogram of arabica beans climbed to 2,327 francs from
2,317 francs, Adzogo said. Cameroon has shipped 61 metric tons
of arabica since the season began in October, according to the
board’s data. Robusta exports reached 209 tons in the harvest
period that started in December and were 29,557 tons during the
last crop period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
