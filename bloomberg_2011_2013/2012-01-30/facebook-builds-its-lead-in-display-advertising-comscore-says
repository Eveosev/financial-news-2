Facebook Inc., the world’s largest
social-networking service, accounted for 28 percent of U.S.
online display-advertising impressions in 2011, expanding its
lead in the industry,  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)  said.  Facebook had 21 percent of impressions -- the number of
times an ad is presented for viewing -- in the previous year,
 ComScore  said.  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  remained No. 2, with 11 percent, the
research firm found.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  was third, accounting for
4.5 percent, followed by Google Inc. at 3.6 percent.  The company’s more than 800 million members and its ability
to target users have made Facebook more attractive to
advertisers. In dollar terms, the company received 16 percent of
spending on U.S. display ads last year, up from 12 percent,
according to another research firm, New York-based  EMarketer
Inc . Display ads usually include photos, banners and videos --
rather than the text links typical of Internet-search ads.  Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, is aiming to
file for an initial public offering as early as this week with a
potential valuation of $75 billion to $100 billion, people
familiar with the matter said last week. The IPO would provide
resources to help the company maintain its lead in social
networking and display ads.  To contact the reporters on this story:
