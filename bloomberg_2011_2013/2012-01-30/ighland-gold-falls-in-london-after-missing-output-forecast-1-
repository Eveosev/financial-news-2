Highland Gold Mining Ltd. (HGM) , a
producer of the precious metal in  Russia , fell to a two-month
low in London trading after missing its 2011 output target.  Highland Gold dropped 5.3 percent to 178 pence, the lowest
closing price since Nov. 24.  The company produced 184,102 ounces of gold and equivalents
at theÂ Mnogovershinnoye, Novoshirokinskoye and Belaya Gora areas
last year, it said today in a statement. That missed guidance of
190,000 to 200,000 ounces given in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
