European Union leaders called on
 Russia  to back a United Nations  Security Council  resolution
backing an Arab League plan to end the bloodshed in Syria.  “A swift reaction by the UN Security Council is urgently
needed,” European Council President  Herman Van Rompuy  said in a
statement after a Brussels meeting of heads of government of the
27 EU members. “I urge all members of the UN Security Council
to assume their responsibilities in relation to the situation in
Syria, and adopt steps long overdue in order to bring an end to
the repression in Syria.”  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  and European
foreign ministers will attend tomorrow’s Security Council
meeting to support an Arab League plan calling for Bashar al- Assad to step down in favor of a national unity government.  “The EU continues to support the efforts of the League of
Arab States aimed at ending the violence in Syria and welcomes
the decision of the League of Arab States to increase
cooperation with the  United Nations ,” Van Rompuy said,
expressing his “outrage over the continuing violence.”  The violence has left more than 5,000 dead since the
uprising against Assad began in March and has intensified since
the Arab League halted its observer mission last week.  Syria has rejected the Arab League proposal, saying it
infringes on the country’s sovereignty, while Russia has opposed
Security Council efforts to take action against Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
