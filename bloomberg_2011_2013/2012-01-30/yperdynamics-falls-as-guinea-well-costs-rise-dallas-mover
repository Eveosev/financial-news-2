Hyperdynamics Corp. (HDY)  declined as much
as 23 percent after it reported rising drilling costs at its
Sabu-1 well off the shore of  Guinea .  Hyperdynamics said it will raise $30 million in a stock
offering to pay for drilling costs at the well and for a seismic
survey.  Hyperdynamics fell 18 percent to $2.78 at 2:46 p.m. in New
York.  “The unexpectedly high cost of the Sabu-1 well has
adversely affected our cash position and liquidity,” the
Houston-based company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  The company said there may be additional drilling delays
that could further damage its finances.  Hyperdynamics holds 77 percent of the Sabu-1 well and the
remaining 23 percent is held by a subsidiary of the  Korean
National Oil Corp (KNOCPZ) . Whether the company will drill a planned
second exploration well at the site depends on whether it can
accumulate the cash it needs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
