Oil traded near the lowest in more
than a week with investors betting fuel demand may falter as
 Europe  struggles to tame its debt crisis and crude stockpiles
increase in the U.S., the biggest consumer of the commodity.  Futures were little changed in  New York  after slipping for
a second day yesterday. European leaders battled with Greece
over a second aid program, clouding an agreement on a permanent
aid fund and stiffer budget rules. An Energy Department report
tomorrow may show U.S. crude inventories rose a second week,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. Global oil markets are
well supplied, OPEC Secretary-General Abdalla El-Badri said.  Crude for March delivery was at $98.92 a barrel, up 14
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 10:05 a.m. Sydney time. The contract yesterday declined 78
cents to $98.78, the lowest close since Jan. 20. Prices are 0.1
percent higher this month.  Brent oil for March settlement dropped 71 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $110.75 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange yesterday. The European benchmark contractâ€™s
premium to West Texas Intermediate futures closed at $11.97,
compared with a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
