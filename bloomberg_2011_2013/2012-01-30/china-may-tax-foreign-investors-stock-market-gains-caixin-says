China  may impose a 10 percent tax on
profits from stock investment by qualified foreign institutional
investors for the first time since the funds were set up nine
years ago, Caixin Online  reported .  The government is seeking feedback on a taxation draft,
Caixin reported yesterday, citing an unidentified person close
to regulators. The China Securities Regulatory Commission didn’t
immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.  China in 2009 levied a 10 percent tax on dividends, bonuses
and interest income earned by so-called QFIIs, without
specifying whether gains on securities investments should be
taxed, the report said.  The nation is approving overseas investment into yuan-
denominated shares at the fastest pace in at least 3 1/2 years,
awarding 14 licenses last month for QFIIs as foreign-exchange
reserves slump and the Shanghai stock index trades near the
lowest level since 2009.  BlackRock Inc., Schroder Investment Management Ltd. and
 Fidelity Investments  are among at least 110 overseas firms
approved to invest about $21.7 billion in stocks and exchange-
traded debt under the QFII program.  Losses from stock investments won’t be deductible under the
proposed rules, according to Caixin.
