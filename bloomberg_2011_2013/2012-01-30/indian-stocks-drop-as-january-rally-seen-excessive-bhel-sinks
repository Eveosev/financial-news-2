Indian stocks dropped for the first
time in seven days amid speculation the benchmark index’s best
start to a year in almost two decades may have exceeded the
outlook for earnings.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the biggest power-equipment
maker, sank the most since May 2004 after its net income missed
analysts’ estimates.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the
largest copper producer, declined the most in 16 months.  Tata
Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, lost 3.1 percent.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, sank 2.3 percent
to 16,839.46, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge has surged 9 percent in January, set
for its best opening month of the year since 1997, as the rupee
advanced, the central bank eased monetary policy and inflation
slowed, prompting foreign  funds  to buy $1.8 billion of stocks.
The Sensex trades at 14.8 times future profits, up from 13.5
times on Dec. 31. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is valued at
10.1 times.  “Valuations are no longer as attractive as they were a
month ago,” said Kishor Ostwal, managing director with CNI
Research Ltd. in Mumbai. “The rally has been driven by an
appreciating currency and foreign flows.”  The Sensex slumped 25 percent in 2011 on concern a falling
rupee and a record run of interest-rate increases will worsen
the effects of  Europe ’s crisis on earnings. Earnings  forecasts 
for Sensex companies for the year ending March 2012 have fallen
8.7 percent to 1,150 rupees per share, the most since the year
ended March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Eight out of 15, or 47 percent, of Sensex companies that
have posted December-quarter earnings missed analyst estimates,
compared with 40 percent in the September quarter and 47 percent
in the previous three months, the data shows.  Foreign  funds  bought a net  $234 million  of Indian stocks on
Jan. 25, data from the  Securities & Exchange Board of India 
show. Overseas  investors  sold $512 million of equities in 2011
on concern a slowdown in the U.S. and the European crisis may
erode earnings. Flows reached a record $29.4 billion in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
