Vulcan Energy Corp. plans to invest
620 billion naira ($3.8 billion) in  Nigeria ’s oil and natural
gas industry within a year, the Trade and Investment Ministry
said.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , or Sinopec, and
California-based Torch Petroleum Inc. also plan to invest 155
billion naira each in Nigeria’s oil and gas industry, the
ministry said today in an e-mailed statement.  The government has “begun collaboration with the various
companies to ensure that the investments are executed within the
time-frame given, especially by ensuring that there are no
bottlenecks in the way of smooth business for the operators,”
Olusegun Aganga, the trade and investment minister said.  More than 20 companies including US-based GE Corp. and
Maire Tecnimont SpA have proposed to invest 4.9 trillion naira
in power, mining, health and transport industries of sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s second-biggest economy within four years, Aganga said.  “The commitments have been on a win-win basis,” Aganga
said.  Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, plans to boost
foreign investment in industries by making it easier to do
business in the country. The government is focusing on changes
that can improve the investment climate and on the overhaul of
industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
