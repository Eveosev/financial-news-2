Central Japan Railway Co. (9022) 
temporarily suspended bullet-train services near  Tokyo  while
residents got a flood warning as Typhoon Man-Yi heading toward
the capital, causing downpours in central and eastern Japan.  Man-Yi, the 18th typhoon this season, was moving north-northwest at about 30 kilometers (19 miles) per hour and was
forecast to make landfall near Tokyo tomorrow, the Japan
Meteorological Agency said on its website. The maximum wind gust
speed was 35 meters a second, it said.  Central Japan Railway suspended bullet train operations
between Shin-Yokohama and Odawara stations in Kanagawa
prefecture, south of Tokyo, for almost an hour due to heavy
rain, public television broadcaster NHK reported on its website.
 All Nippon Airways Co. (9202)  canceled six flights between Tokyoâ€™s
Haneda airport and Hachijojima island today, NHK said.  The Meteorological Agency issued a flood warning to
residents living near the Kokai river in Tochigi Prefecture,
north of Tokyo, and lifted an earlier flood warning for the
Meguro river, which runs through Tokyo. An evacuation warning
was issued for about 4,000 homes in Hiratsuka city, south of
Tokyo, NHK reported.  The agency expects central and western  Japan  to receive as
much as 600 millimeters of rain by tomorrow morning, and areas
around Tokyo to get 350 millimeters of rain, NHK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
