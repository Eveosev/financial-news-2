Wladimir Balentien broke  Japan ’s
five-decade-old record for home runs in a season with home runs
in the first and third innings at  Tokyo ’s Jingu Stadium.  Balentien hit his 56th and 57th homers of the season
yesterday, eclipsing Sadaharu Oh’s record of 55 set in 1964 and
ending almost three decades of controversy over repeated
attempts to protect it from foreign challengers.  The 29-year-old Yakult Swallows outfielder smashed a two-run homer off Hanshin Tigers pitcher Daiki Enokida in the bottom
of the first inning. He followed with a solo shot off Enokida in
the third. The Swallows won the game 9-0.  “I want to applaud Balentien on an amazing achievement,”
said Maki Murayama, a 38-year-old Tokyo office worker. “This is
all I’ve been able to think about the last few days as he was
just shy of the record. As a Yakult fan, I won’t ever forget
this day.”  Balentien, who had 31 homers in each of his first two
seasons with the Swallows, is a native of the Caribbean island
of Curacao who played in the U.S. Major Leagues from 2007 to
2009, hitting 15 home runs in 170 games for the  Seattle Mariners 
and  Cincinnati Reds . The feat ends a controversy around other
former Major Leaguers who flirted with breaking the record, only
to be walked repeatedly.  Batters Walked  Tuffy Rhodes hit 55 home runs in 2001 as did Alex Cabrera
in 2002. Both faced Daiei Hawks teams managed by Oh in their
final attempts to break his home-run record, and got few pitches
anywhere near the strike zone.  Hanshin’s Randy Bass received four straight intentional
walks in his team’s final game of the 1985 season, stranding him
one home run short of Oh’s mark of 55. The opposing team was the
Yomiuri Giants, managed by Oh and the team for which he hit 868
homers and won nine Most Valuable Player awards.  Balentien may face questions about the legitimacy of his
home-run total after  Nippon Professional Baseball  earlier this
season acknowledged changing the balls used in games to make
them fly farther when hit. NPB’s six Central League teams this
year hit  640 homers  as of Sept. 12, compared with 454 for the
entire 2012 season.  The outfielder is not the only NPB player setting records
this season. Masahiro Tanaka, a 24-year-old right-hander with
Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, recorded his 21st win without a
loss, breaking a 56-year-old Japanese pitching record.  Tanaka beat the Orix Buffaloes 6-2 on Sept. 13 in a home
game in the northern city of Sendai, breaking the record of
Kazuhisa Inao, who started the 1957 season 20-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
