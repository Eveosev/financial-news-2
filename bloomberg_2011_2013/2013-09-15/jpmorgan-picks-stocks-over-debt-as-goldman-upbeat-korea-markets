South Korean stocks are  beating 
bonds by the most in six quarters as foreign investors buy
shares at the fastest pace on record and accelerating global
economic growth increases the chances of monetary tightening.  The  Kospi (KOSPI)  index has added 7 percent since the end of June,
compared with a gain of less than 0.1 percent in Bank of America
Corp.’s index tracking the nation’s sovereign debt, the biggest
gap since the first quarter of 2012. While overseas money
managers withdrew $1.9 billion from debt in August, equities
lured inflows in the past five weeks, including a record $3.6
billion last week. The Kospi is  valued  at 1.1 times net assets,
a 47 percent discount versus the MSCI All-Country World Index.  JPMorgan Asset Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say
shares will keep outperforming bonds as the fastest  export 
growth in seven months boosts profit at Kospi companies, which
get about 40 percent of their  sales  overseas. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predict the  Federal Reserve  will announce
a reduction in its bond-purchase program on Sept. 18, while
Goldman Sachs says the  Bank of Korea  will increase  interest
rates  in the second half of 2014.  “We bought more Korean stocks in August,” Grace Tam, a
Hong Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset,
which manages about $1.5 trillion, said in a telephone interview
on Sept. 11. “Rotation from bonds to equities will go on.”  International investors have poured a net $7.2 billion into
South Korean  shares  in the past five weeks as data showed the
economy expanded 1.1 percent in the three months through June
from the previous quarter, while exports jumped at a quicker-than-estimated 7.7 percent rate in August. Foreigners bought a
net $165.4 million worth of Kospi shares as of 10:37 a.m. in
 Seoul  today, extending net purchases to 17 consecutive days. The
benchmark Kospi index added 0.9 percent to 2011.96.  Samsung Inflows  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s biggest smartphone
maker, attracted $2.05 billion of inflows during the period and
 SK Hynix Inc. (000660) , the second-largest computer-memory chipmaker,
lured $573 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Kospi  advanced  2 percent last week to 1,994.32,
extending its rally from an 11-month low on June 25 to 12
percent. The Bank of America bond index returned 0.8 percent
last week and its yield slipped to 3.19 percent, within 0.01
percentage point of the lowest level since July 24. The won
strengthened 0.6 percent to 1,086.88 per dollar, paring this
year’s drop to 2.1 percent. The cost of protecting the nation’s
debt against nonpayment using credit default swaps rose to 75
basis points from 73.5, according to CMA.  Profit Growth  The benchmark equity  index  will probably climb to as high
as 2,200 by the middle of next year, a 10 percent gain from its
closing level on Sept. 13, according to Kwon Goohoon, a Seoul-based economist for Goldman Sachs.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization at Kospi index companies will probably  climb  15
percent in the next 12 months, versus 10 percent for the MSCI
All-Country index, according analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Corporate earnings will see better growth, most likely
from the fourth quarter, as global economies including  Korea  are
turning around,” Kwon said in a phone interview.  Reduced stimulus by the Fed will weigh on most emerging-market assets, including South Korean equities, Vivek Misra, a
Bangalore-based Asia equity strategist at Societe Generale SA,
said in a telephone interview on Sept. 13. The Kospi may end the
year at 1,900, about 5 percent below the closing level last
week, before rallying in 2014, Misra said.  Fed Taper  The U.S. central bank will cut monthly Treasury purchases
to $35 billion from $45 billion while maintaining mortgage-bond
buying at $40 billion, according to the median of 34 responses
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists on Sept. 6. That pace
was unchanged from an Aug. 9-13 poll, as was a projection that
the program will end in June. The Kospi has  rallied  106 percent
since the Fed’s first round of bond-buying in 2008.  The gains in South Korean stocks this quarter have reduced
dividend  yields  on the Kospi to the lowest levels since April
2012 compared with the yield on debt, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The equity gauge has a payout of 1.17 percent,
versus the 3.57 percent yield on the nation’s 10-year government
 bonds . The gap of 2.4 percent compares with the 16-month low of
2.5 percent on Aug. 19.  Investors will continue favoring equities over bonds as
 interest rates  rise, said Kim Jiun, a Seoul-based analyst at
Shinhan Investment Corp. The foreign withdrawals from debt in
August were the first in seven months, according to the
Financial Supervisory Service.  BlackRock Outlook  While the Bank of Korea held its key interest rate at 2.5
percent for a fourth straight month last week, Goldman Sachs
estimates the central bank will increase the rate to 3 percent
by the end of 2014. The economy will expand 2.8 percent in 2013
and 4 percent next year, which would be the fastest pace since
2010, according to central bank forecasts.  “We have been holding a conservative view on the  bond
market  and have moved to bonds with shorter maturity,” Kim Ki
Hyun, head of the fixed-income investment division at Woori
Asset Management Co., said by phone from Seoul.  Quicker global growth is boosting the sales outlook for
South Korean companies, according to BlackRock Inc., the world’s
largest money manager.  Service industries  in the U.S. expanded
in August at the fastest pace in almost eight years as a pickup
in demand encouraged companies to increase hiring, the  Institute
for Supply Management  said on Sept. 5.  “Korean exporters are benefiting from global growth,”
Marc Desmidt, the head of alpha strategies for Asia Pacific at
BlackRock, which oversees about $3.8 trillion, said in a Sept.
11 interview on Bloomberg Television. “If that continues that
will be very good for them.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
