The Netherlands will not reach its
EU-deficit target in 2014 despite 6 billion euros ($8 billion)
of additional austerity measures.  The  budget deficit  will hit 3.3 percent of gross domestic
product in 2014, The Hague-based government’s planning agency
CPB said today. This deficit takes into account an additional
austerity package of 6 billion euros in 2014 to be announced on
Sept. 17, when Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem presents his
2014-budget plans. CPB sees a deficit of 3.2 percent in 2013.
The Netherlands has been in breach of the EU limit of 3 percent
of GDP since the beginning of the crisis in 2008.  The fifth-largest economy in the euro area will contract
1.25 percent this year and grow 0.5 percent in 2014, the bureau
said. In August, CPB forecast a growth of 0.75 for 2014.  “Economic growth is mainly pressured by internal
spending,” CPB said.  Private consumption, investments and
 government spending  had a negative impact on GDP growth in 2013.
Only export contributed positively. While private consumption
will remain negative in 2014, investments and government
spending will have a positive impact.  Prime Minister  Mark Rutte ’s plan for additional cost cuts
and tax increases comes on top of a four-year, 16 billion-euro
package the coalition of the Liberal and  Labor party  approved in
November last year when it took office. Of this amount, 3.5
billion euro was already penciled in for 2014.  “In 2014 private consumption will continue to shrink, but
less than in the recent years,” CPB said. The negative impact
of the 6 billion-package on economic growth in 2014 will remain
limited to 0.25 percent, it said. Unemployment is expected to
rise to 7 percent in 2013 and 7.5 percent next year, based on
international calculation standards.  Part of Package  Part of the package the Cabinet agreed to in 2012, is a
pension reform plan. By making a smaller amount of pension
premiums tax deductible, the cabinet aims to save up to 2.9
billion euro in 2017 according to the coalition agreement dated
Oct. 29. The pension reform plan still has to be approved by the
Senate where the coalition lacks majority.  The coalition remained united in the austerity message to
the public while its popularity has dropped to an all-time low.
Labor and the  Liberal party  would only retain 30 seats if
elections were held now, a drop of 49 seats, according to a poll
by Peil.nl, published Sept. 8. The Labor Party would have 11
seats while Rutte’s Liberal Party would get 19 seats, according
to the poll, based on at least 2,500 interviews.  To contact the reporters on this story:
