The University of Alabamaâ€™s victory
over  Texas A&M University  drew the best preliminary  television
rating in 23 years for an afternoon regular-season college
football game on CBS.  The national champion and top-ranked Crimson Tide beat
Heisman Trophy winning-quarterback Johnny Manziel and his sixth-ranked Aggies 49-42 yesterday.  The broadcast earned a 9.0 overnight rating and 21 share,
the best preliminary rating since a 10.1 for a game between
Miami and  Notre Dame  on Oct. 20, 1990, CBS said.  Overnight ratings measure the largest markets in the U.S.
Ratings quantify the percentage of all homes with televisions
tuned to a program, with share representing the percentage of
all homes with TVs in use at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
