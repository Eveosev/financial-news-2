Germany ’s Free Democratic Party
said it will step up its campaign to remain Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition ally after a state election defeat one week
before the national vote.  Support for the FDP fell to 3 percent in Bavarian regional
elections today from 8 percent five years ago, bouncing the
party out of the state legislature, according to separate
projections by public broadcasters ARD and ZDF.  “This is without a doubt a serious defeat for the FDP,”
FDP head Philipp Roesler told reporters in televised remarks.
“But from now it’s about Germany. This result is a wake-up call
to all liberals in Germany”  Merkel, who has guided  Europe ’s largest economy through the
euro-area debt crisis, is seeking a third term on Sept. 22 and
says her preference would be to extend her second-term coalition
with the Free Democrats. If replicated at the national level, an
FDP collapse might force Merkel to ally with the Social
Democrats, the main opposition party.  At the same time, Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc
includes the Bavaria-based  Christian Social Union , which gained
voter share and won an absolute majority in the state’s
legislature, according to the projections.  The vote in Bavaria “gives us hope that this momentum will
help re-elect Angela Merkel,” Armin Laschet, a deputy chairman
of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, said on ARD
television. “The FDP has traditionally been weak in Bavaria.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
