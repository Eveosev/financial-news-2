German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
sister party was set to win a majority in Bavarian state
elections, giving the incumbent a boost as she heads into the
final week of her campaign before a national vote.  Merkel’s Christian Social Union sister party took 49
percent, regaining sole control of the country’s second-most
populous state, according to exit polls on ZDF television. Led
by Prime Minister  Horst Seehofer , the CSU rebounded from 2008
when its worst result in more than 50 years forced it into
coalition with the Free Democrats, who won 3 percent, below the
5 percent hurdle required to win seats in parliament.  Bavaria is a bellwether for the Sept. 22 federal vote, with
the CSU majority lending Merkel momentum against her Social
Democrat challenger,  Peer Steinbrueck . Merkel is due to hold a
rally on Sept. 20 in the state capital Munich that will be her
eighth speech in Bavaria since July, underlining the region’s
importance to her bid for a third term.  The opposition Social Democrats took 20.5 percent, while
their Green party allies had 8.5 percent. The Free Voters, who
want  Greece  to exit the euro, oppose euro-area bailouts and want
to trim the power of the European Union, won 8.5 percent.  The first results based on partially counted ballots will
be released from about 6:15 p.m. and preliminary final results
are published about 11 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
