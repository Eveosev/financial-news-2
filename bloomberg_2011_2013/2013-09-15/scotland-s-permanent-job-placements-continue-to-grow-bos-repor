The growth in permanent job
placements last month in  Scotland  stayed near their highest on
record, the Bank of Scotland said today in a report.  “August’s Barometer was at the second highest level since
September 2007,” Donald MacRae, chief economist at Bank of
Scotland, said in the e-mailed statement. “The number of people
appointed to permanent jobs rose sharply, while the number of
vacancies for permanent jobs increased at the strongest rate for
over two years.”  Aberdeen in northern Scotland showed the strongest rise in
permanent placements while Dundee had the greatest increase in
temporary appointments, the report said.  The Bank of Scotland Labour Market Barometer was at 59.7 in
August, compared with 60.3 in July.  Bank of Scotland is part of the  Lloyds Banking Group Plc. (LLOY)   To contact the reporter on this story:
