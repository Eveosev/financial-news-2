Jim Furyk  takes a one-stroke lead
into the final round of the BMW Championship, where a victory
today will give him his 17th PGA Tour title.  Furyk fired a 2-under 69 yesterday, one day after carding
the sixth 59 in PGA Tour history. Furyk had three birdies in a
five-hole stretch around the turn before he had a three-putt
bogey from 30 feet on the par-5 18th hole.  “It could have been better out there,” Furyk told
reporters. “Obviously dropped that shot at 18, which I’m
disappointed, it was probably one of the easier holes of the day
scoring wise.”  Furyk has lost the last five tournaments in which he owned
the 54-hole lead.  Steve Stricker  is one stroke back in second place at 12-under 201 after recording a 7-under 64, and  Brandt Snedeker
shot an even-par 71 to stand 11-under at 202 at Conway Farms
Golf Club in  Lake Forest ,  Illinois .  “I had a number in mind to start the day, which I
typically don’t do,” Stricker said. “Came up a little short,
but all in all it was a good day.”  Tiger Woods , a five-time winner of this event, birdied six
of seven holes from the sixth en route to a 5-under 66 to take
sole possession of fifth at 9-under 204.  “I had a nice little run to at least get myself in there
where I have a chance tomorrow,” Woods told reporters
yesterday.  Defending champion Rory McIlroy ended the third round with
a 68 to hold 68th place at 10-over 223.  To contact the reporter on this story:
