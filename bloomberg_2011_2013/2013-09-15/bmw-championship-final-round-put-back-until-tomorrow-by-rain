Golf’s BMW Championship, the third
of the U.S.  PGA Tour ’s four playoff events, is scheduled to be
completed today after heavy rain in the Chicago area postponed
the final round.  Jim Furyk  and  Steve Stricker  are scheduled to go out in the
final group at 9:40 a.m. local time. Furyk holds a one-shot lead
at 13-under par over Stricker at Conway Farms Golf Club in  Lake
Forest , Illinois.  “It’s supposed to get windy,” Furyk told reporters
yesterday after play was halted. “Hopefully the course will dry
up nicely, and it’s going to be a different golf course. It was
real firm and fast all week. I expect that won’t be the case
with all the rain we got, but it’s going to be windy, kind of
like what we saw earlier in the week.”  The fourth round was delayed by 3 1/2 hours after play was
suspended yesterday at 11 a.m. eastern time. Forty-six of the 70
players in the field were on the course or finished with the
final round when play was halted by rain at 3:28 p.m. after
puddles began forming on fairways and greens.  Brandt Snedeker is 11 under, one shot ahead of  Zach Johnson , with  Tiger Woods  at 9-under.  The 70-player BMW Championship field will be whittled down
to the top 30 players in the FedEx Cup standings for the season-ending Tour Championship, which is scheduled to begin Sept. 19
at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta.  The BMW Championship and Tour Championship each earn the
winner $1.44 million, with the No. 1 player in the FedEx Cup
standings receiving a $10 million bonus.  Furyk’s 59  Furyk shot an 11-under-par 59 in the second round to tie
the tour record low score in a competitive round.  Stuart Appleby 
was the most recent of the five other players to shoot 59 in
competition, in the final round of the 2010 Greenbrier Classic.
 Paul Goydos ,  David Duval , Chip Beck and Al Geiberger are the
other golfers with 59s in an official PGA Tour round. Bo Van Pelt shot a 59 during the Phoenix Open Pro-Am this year.  Furyk, 43, is chasing 17th PGA Tour win and first since the
Tour Championship in 2010, a victory that also secured him the
$10 million FedEx Cup bonus.  Stricker, 46, is seeking his 13th PGA Tour win and first
since the Tournament of Champions in January 2012, while
Snedeker is vying for his seventh tour title. The 32-year-old
won the Tour Championship and $10 million FedEx Cup bonus in
2012 and is a two-time winner on tour this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
