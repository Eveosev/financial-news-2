Lawmakers from Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s  Conservative Party  have written to Defence Secretary
Philip Hammond to protest cuts to the number of full-time U.K.
troops.  The government’s plan to reduce the size of regular army by
20,000 and replace them with reservists is jeopardizing
Britain’s defenses, according to the letter signed by 25 rank-and-file Tory lawmakers.  “We’re getting to the point with regards cuts to our armed
forces where we’re not just cutting to the bone, we’re cutting
into the bone,” lawmaker John Baron told BBC Radio 4 today.
“We’re not convinced that this idea of replacing 20,000 regular
troops with reservists will produce the costs savings envisaged,
but we are pretty sure it’s going to produce capability gaps
that could cost us dear in the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
