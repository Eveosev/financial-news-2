One in 10 voters who plan to vote
against Scottish independence would change or reconsider their
choice if the U.K. didn’t grant the region’s Parliament more
powers, a  ICM Research Ltd.  survey for  Scotland  on Sunday shows.  Among those who are decided on the issue, 60 percent oppose
breaking away from the U.K. and 40 percent plan to vote in
favor. That lead shrunk to 55 percent versus 45 percent when
respondents were asked to assume that a vote against would also
result in no extra powers for the parliament, according to the
poll. A referendum on independence will be held Sept. 18, 2014.  U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  told the newspaper
that government leaders must “look at the alternative vision to
independence” and that he agrees with his Scottish friends who
“want Scottish nationhood and identity to be more fully
expressed in our institutions.”  The Scottish Parliament legislates on matters such as
transportation, health, justice and education, while the U.K.
controls broader economic policy and finances, as well as
defense, foreign affairs and social welfare.  A majority of voters in all age groups oppose independence,
while one in five respondents say they have yet to decide, the
newspaper said. It didn’t give a margin of error.  ICM Research interviewed 1,002 members of the Scottish
public online between Sept. 10 and 13. The results were weighted
to the profile of all Scottish adults aged 16 and over.  To contact the reporter on this story:
