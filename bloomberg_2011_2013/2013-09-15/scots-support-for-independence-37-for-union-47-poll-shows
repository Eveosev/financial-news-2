Scottish support for independence
stands at 37 percent, unchanged from July, and below the 47
percent who want to stay in the U.K., according to a poll.  Support for the union gained one percentage point from
July, and 16 percent were undecided, down one point, the
Panelbase poll of 1,002 people published in the Sunday Times
showed.  When the undecided were asked how they would vote if the
referendum were today, the gap shrank to 48 percent supporting
independence and 52 percent backing the union with the U.K., the
Times reported.  Panelbase , unlike some polling companies, weights its
respondents to match the demographics of the 2011 Scottish
parliamentary election, the Times said. If the poll is weighted
to match how Scots voted in the 2010 U.K. election, 31 percent
would support independence and 53 percent would be against
separation, the newspaper reported.  The Times didnâ€™t give a margin of error for the poll, which
was conducted from Aug. 30 to Sept. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
