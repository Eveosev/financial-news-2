Most U.K. companies say their
businesses have not been affected by next year’s referendum on
Scottish independence, according to a survey published today.  Nine out of 10 of the 2,000 companies polled by the  British
Chambers of Commerce  said the referendum was having no
substantive effect on business.  One in seven companies said they didn’t have enough
information on the referendum, and one in six said it was too
early to say what impact it would have, the group said in an e-mailed statement. Two-thirds of those who reported no impact
said most of their business was conducted outside of  Scotland .  Independence is the flagship policy of Scottish First
Minister  Alex Salmond  and his  Scottish National Party , which
runs the semi-autonomous government in Edinburgh. A referendum
on independence is scheduled for Sept. 18 next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
