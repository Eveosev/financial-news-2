A.J. McCarron passed for four
touchdowns and 334 yards as No. 1 University of  Alabama  defeated
sixth-ranked Texas A&M University 49-42 in college football.  The Crimson Tide rallied from being down 14 points in the
first 10 minutes of the game when Aggies quarterback Johnny Manziel completed a one-yard pass to Cameron Clear for the first
of five touchdown passes, and Ben Malena scored on a one-yard
run.  In other games involving the top ten teams in the AP
Writers’ Poll, it was No. 2 Oregon 59, Tennessee 14; No. 4 Ohio
State 52, California 34; No. 5 Stanford 34, Army 20; No. 7
Louisville 27, Kentucky 13; No. 8 Louisiana State 45, Kent 13;
and No. 10 Florida State 62, Nevada 7.  At Kyle Field in College Station,  Texas , McCarron threw
touchdown passes of 22, 44 and 51 yards and T.J. Yeldon scored
on a four-yard run to give the Crimson Tide a 28-14 halftime
lead.  “I’m so proud of our players for the resiliency they
showed getting behind 14-0,” Alabama coach Nick Saban told
reporters. “Just slowly and methodically coming back in the
game and building up the lead.”  Alabama’s Vincent Sunseri started the third quarter with a
73-yard interception return and Kenyan Drake had a three-yard
touchdown run as the Crimson Tide (2-0, 1-0 Southeastern
Conference) expanded their lead to 42-21.  Not Super Bowl  Manziel, last year’s Heisman Trophy winner, threw three
fourth-quarter touchdown passes, including one with 15 seconds
left in the game, to bring the Aggies (2-1, 0-1) within one
touchdown of Alabama. He completed 28 of 39 passing attempts for
464 yards and two interceptions.  “I thought his play was Johnny-like,” said coach Kevin Sumlin of Manziel. “Anybody who’s seen him play, that’s about
right.”  The game was a rematch from last season, when the Aggies
handed the Crimson Tide their only loss in a 29-24 contest.  “This wasn’t the Super Bowl,” Manziel said. “Alabama
lost a game last year and still went on to win the national
championship. Our season isn’t over.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
