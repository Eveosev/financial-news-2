Subdued inflation expectations are
helping to prevent this year’s selloff in  government bonds  from
deepening into a rout comparable to that seen in 1994, the  Bank
for International Settlements  said.  Yields on  government securities  are still low by historical
standards because increases since the  Federal Reserve  said it
could cut monetary stimulus haven’t immediately been accompanied
by higher central-bank rates, the Basel, Switzerland-based BIS
said in its latest Quarterly Review today. That’s helping to
sustain demand for higher-yielding assets, it said.  “The recent selloff did little to undermine the relative
appeal of riskier securities, which asserted itself in the
second half of 2012 and persisted through the third quarter of
2013,” the BIS said in its report. “This extended the squeeze
of credit spreads and fueled strong issuance of bonds and loans
in the riskier part of the spectrum.”  Treasury 10-year  yields  have jumped 84 basis points, or
0.84 percentage point, since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
May 22 that the central bank could start slowing the pace of its
bond purchases this year. They were at 2.89 percent at 5:35 p.m.
London time on Sept. 13, compared with a 10-year average of 3.53
percent. At the same time, investor expectations of inflation as
measured by bond trading dropped, leaving the central bank
reiterating that  interest rates  will stay near zero.  A 2 percentage-point jump in the Treasury yields in 1994
was accompanied by a 2.5 percentage point increase in the Fed’s
target rate to 5.5 percent.  Inflation Expectations  In 1994, long-term nominal yields rose together with policy
rates and the potential for higher consumer prices, the BIS said.
“By contrast, inflation expectations were largely unchanged in 
the second and third quarters of 2013.”  Treasury 10-year  yields  are still almost 2 percentage
points less than the average in the decade prior to the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, supporting demand for
assets with higher returns.  Yields on German 10-year  bunds ,  Europe ’s benchmark
securities, closed at 1.98 percent on Sept. 13, versus a five-year average of 2.48 percent.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 50 high-yield companies fell on Sept. 11 to the least
since May 22. The index typically drops as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates.  Low core-government-bond yields are “perpetuating the
relative appeal of higher-yielding asset classes,” the BIS
said. Demand for those assets is “a phenomenon reminiscent of
the exuberance prior to the global financial crisis” that broke
out five years ago, it said.  The BIS was formed in 1930 and acts as a central bank for
the world’s monetary authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
