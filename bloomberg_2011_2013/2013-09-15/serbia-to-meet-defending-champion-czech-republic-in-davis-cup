Top-ranked Novak Djokovic and Janko
Tipsarevic pushed  Serbia  into its second Davis Cup final in four
years by winning their singles matches to overcome  Canada  in
Belgrade.  The Serbs, which prevented the Canadians from reaching
their first final, will meet defending champion Czech Republic,
which beat Argentina 3-2 in  Prague  in the other semifinal.
Serbia, the 2010 champions, will host the November 15-17 final
against the Czechs.  Canada entered the last day with a 2-1 lead in the
semifinal and needed to win one of todayâ€™s singles matches.
Djokovic beat Milos Raonic 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-2 in the first and
then Tipsarevic defeated Vasek Pospisil 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, 7-6
(8-6) to send the Serbs through to the final.  To contact the reporters on this story:
