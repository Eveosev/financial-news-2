Floyd Mayweather Jr. remained
undefeated in 45 fights by winning a majority decision in his
12-round super welterweight bout against  Mexico ’s Canelo
Alvarez.  Two judges scored in favor of Mayweather while the third
scored a draw for last night’s fight at the MGM Grand in  Las
Vegas .  “I just listened to my corner, listened to my dad,”
Mayweather said in a televised ringside interview. “My dad had
a brilliant game plan, and I went out there and got the job
done.”  Mayweather, wearing blue and gray trunks, improved his
record to 45-0-0 with 26 knockouts. Alvarez, sporting the red,
green and white of Mexico, got his first loss for a career
record of 42-1-1 with 30 knockouts.  “Canelo is a young strong champion,” Mayweather said. “A
true champion like Canelo can take a loss and bounce back.”  The winner connected with 232 of 505 total hits for 46
percent, while Alvarez landed 22 percent or 117 of 526 of his
punches.  “I couldn’t catch him,” Alvarez said through an
interpreter. “He’s very elusive. I didn’t know how to get him.
There’s no doubt he’s a great fighter, an intelligent fighter.”  Mayweather, 36, received a record $41.5 million in
guaranteed purse that would push his career earnings since 1996
to $350 million. His 23-year-old opponent earned $5 million for
the bout.  Topped Forbes List  The event was one of the richest fights ever with a live
gate of $20 million and at least another $100 million from pay-per-view, the  Associated Press  reported. Tickets were being
offered online for as much as $29,000.  In 2012, Mayweather topped Forbes magazine’s world’s
highest paid athletes list, collecting $85 million for two
fights against Victor Ortiz and  Miguel Cotto . He garnered 14th
place with $34 million in earnings for the year ending in June
as his only paycheck came from his May fight with Robert
Guerrero.  Mayweather signed a six-fight deal with Showtime that is
worth $200 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
