West Ham United goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen produced several saves as West Ham United held on
to draw 0-0 at Southampton in English soccer’s Premier League.  The home team had almost 60 percent of the possession and
five shots on target to West Ham’s one yesterday. Jaaskelainen,
38, made stops from Dani Osvaldo, Morgan Schneiderlin, Rickie Lambert and Victor Wanyama to keep the Hammers in the game.  West Ham, which has managed just six shots on target in the
league this season and hasn’t scored since a 2-0 win against
 Cardiff City  on the opening day, moved up to 10th place in the
standings, one spot ahead of Southampton.  “We’re creating chances and we just have to start putting
them away,” Jaaskelainen, who made a league-high 166 saves last
season, said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
“We get one goal and that confidence will come. But I’m happy
to keep clean sheets.”  Liverpool can go three points clear of Arsenal and
Tottenham Hotspur at the top tonight by winning at Swansea.
Spurs and Arsenal joined the Reds with nine points two days ago
by beating Norwich and Sunderland, respectively.  Elsewhere, Everton defeated Chelsea 1-0 for its first
league win of the season, while  Manchester United  beat 10-man
Crystal Palace 2-0 to give new manager  David Moyes  his first
home victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
