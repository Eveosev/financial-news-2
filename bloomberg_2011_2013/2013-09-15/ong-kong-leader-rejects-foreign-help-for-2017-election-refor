Hong Kong doesn’t need assistance
from British or other foreign governments to bring in universal
suffrage to elect its next leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying told reporters in the city yesterday.  Leung was responding to comments by Hugo Swire, a minister
in the U.K.’s Foreign Office, which were published in the  South
China Morning Post ’s opinion page Sept. 14. Swire wrote that his
country offers its support, and that it is important that the
city’s people have a “genuine choice.”  The matter is entirely a domestic affair between Hong Kong
and  China  and is unrelated to other governments, Leung said in
the briefing. China took back sovereignty of Hong Kong from the
U.K. in 1997 and under the Basic Law allows the city wide-ranging independence to govern itself under the “one country,
two systems” policy.  Hong Kong’s government is “determined” to realize the
goal of electing the next chief executive within the framework
of the law, Leung said. He reiterated there is sufficient time
to complete the consultation process in time for the 2017 event.  Foreign officials who have tried to support or influence
 Hong Kong ’s political reform have met with negative results in
the past, Leung said.  Hong Kong Chief Secretary Carrie Lam also responded to
Swire’s commentary and rejected the need for outside help in the
city’s political process, the Sunday Morning Post reported
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
