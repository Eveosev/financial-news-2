Lumber fell the most in two weeks as
confidence among U.S. homebuilders unexpectedly dropped in
February, signaling slower demand.  Builder sentiment in February fell to 46 from January’s 47,
which matched the highest reading since April 2006, a National
Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo report showed today.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists
projected a rise to 48. Lumber prices surged 42 percent in the
past 12 months on signs of a rebound in the U.S. housing
industry.  “This is one group that a lot of people look at, and
believe in,” so the report caused prices to fall,  Hakan Ekstrom , the president of Wood Resource International in
Seattle, Washington, said by telephone.  Lumber futures for May delivery fell 2.5 percent to $389.70
per 1,000 board feet on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the
biggest drop since Jan. 30. Earlier, prices touched $401.80, the
highest since April 2005.  “At $400, people are saying ‘maybe we should wait to
buy,’” Ekstrom said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
