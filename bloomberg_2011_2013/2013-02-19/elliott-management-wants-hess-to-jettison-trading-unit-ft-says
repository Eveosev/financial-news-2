Elliott Management Corp., which
holds a 4 percent stake in Hess Corp., said the oil company
should spin off its partly owned trading arm, according to a
 report  in the Financial Times.  Elliott Management disclosed its interest last month in
 Hess  and is urging the company to jettison  Hetco Energy Trading
Co. , founded in 1997 by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traders
Stephen Hendel and Stephen Simliz, the FT reported.  “What is the strategic purpose of an upstream company
running a hedge fund? Hess should clearly exit this business and
focus on its upstream operations,” the FT quoted  Quentin Koffey ,
an Elliott associate portfolio manager, as saying.  Hess helped fund the inception of Hetco and has a 50
percent voting interest, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
