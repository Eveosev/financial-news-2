South Korea denied that the Group of
20 nations endorsed Japan’s quantitative easing, an indication
that tensions remain after a gathering in Moscow where finance
chiefs discussed the weakening yen.  “The message from Moscow should not be understood as that
the leaders endorsed Japan’s quantitative easing,” Choi Hee
Nam, a director general at the finance ministry, said at a
briefing in Sejong. “The G-20 also didn’t officially oppose
Japan’s policies, but the topic was very controversial.”  Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-20 didn’t
censure Japan for allowing the yen to drop, a fact that gave
Japanese economic policies a “green light,” according to  Akio Kato , the team leader for Japanese debt at Kokusai Asset
Management Co. Since coming to power in a landslide victory in
December, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called on the Bank
of Japan to step up asset purchases, driving the yen to the
weakest level since May 2010 last week.  The won has gained about 24 percent against the yen in the
past six months, aiding Japanese competitors of South Korean
companies that export electronics and automobiles.  The yen gained 0.3 percent to reach 93.69 per dollar as of
3:38 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
