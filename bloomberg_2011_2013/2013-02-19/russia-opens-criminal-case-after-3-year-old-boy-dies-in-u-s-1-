Russia opened a criminal case after
a three-year-old boy adopted from the country by American
citizens died in the U.S., the Investigative Committee said.  Russia is seeking the arrest of the child’s adoptive mother
and wants to make her the subject of an international arrest
warrant, the law-enforcement agency in Moscow said in a
 statement  on its website today. The country’s investigators also
want to be involved in the U.S. probe into the incident,
according to the statement.  Lawmakers in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
summoned the U.S. ambassador to Russia,  Michael McFaul , to
answer questions about the boy’s death, state television
reported. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow didn’t immediately respond
to a request for comment.  Russia passed legislation in December barring U.S.
adoptions in retaliation for American sanctions over the death
of lawyer  Sergei Magnitsky , who’d alleged a $230 million tax
fraud by Russian officials.  Members of the ruling United Russia party accused opponents
of the adoption legislation, called the Dima Yakovlev Law after
a Russian boy who died in the U.S. in 2008 after being left in a
car on a hot day, of being unpatriotic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
