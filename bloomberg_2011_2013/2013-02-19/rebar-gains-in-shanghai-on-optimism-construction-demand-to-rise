Steel reinforcement-bar futures
climbed in Shanghai from the lowest level this month on
speculation that demand for the building material will increase
as construction projects resume after China’s biggest holiday.  Rebar for delivery in October advanced 0.3 percent to 4,186
yuan ($670) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. The
metal fell 2.4 percent yesterday after the Chinese market opened
from a week-long Lunar New Year holiday.  The spot price for rebar rose to the highest since July,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. The
price of iron ore also gained, giving steel mills more leverage
to charge higher prices for their products, Beijing Cifco
Futures Co. wrote in a research report today.  “The market expects demand to revive as warmer weather
allows housing and rail construction to pick up,”  Wu Zhili ,
analyst at Shenhua Futures Co., said by phone from Shenzhen in
southern China. “Firm spot prices have given traders solid
rationale to buy after yesterday’s big drop.”  The average spot  price  for rebar advanced 1.1 percent to
3,879 yuan today, after gaining 1.2 percent on the first day of
trading since the week-long holiday, according to Beijing
Antaike. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port yesterday rose 1.4
percent to $157.20 a dry ton, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
