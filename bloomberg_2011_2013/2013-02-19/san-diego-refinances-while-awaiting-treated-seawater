San Diego County Water Authority
sold $299.1 million in refunding debt as the California agency
builds the Western Hemisphere’s largest water-desalination
plant.  Rates on the Feb. 13 deal ranged from 1.13 percent on
securities maturing in 2019, five basis points above a top-rated
benchmark, to 3.43 percent on those due in 2033, 88 basis points
over a benchmark. The final maturity, 2034, was priced to yield
2.86 percent, a spread of 25 basis points,  according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The authority, which serves 97 percent of the population in
San Diego County, plans to spend $754.4 million on capital
projects, a third of which will be used in the fiscal years
ending in June 2013 and June 2014, bond documents say.  One of the authority’s initiatives is a public-private
partnership with  Poseidon Resources  LP, a Stamford, Connecticut-
based company that develops and invests in water infrastructure
projects. Of the $922 million in costs, $734 million was raised
through tax-exempt bonds issued by the California Pollution
Control Financing Authority on behalf of Poseidon and the San
Diego authority, according to a December  statement  from
Poseidon.  The  plant , 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of San Diego,
will open in 2016. It will treat Pacific Ocean water and will be
the largest such facility in the Western Hemisphere, according
to Poseidon. A 10-mile pipeline will deliver about 50 million
gallons of treated water daily from the plant to the county’s
water system, Poseidon said.  The authority’s bond sale last week, which refunded 2004
senior-lien water revenue bonds, was rated Aa2 by Moody’s
Investors Service, its third-highest level, and AA+ by Standard
& Poor’s, its second-highest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
