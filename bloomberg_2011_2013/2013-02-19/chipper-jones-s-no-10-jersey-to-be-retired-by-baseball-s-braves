Chipper Jones , an eight-time All-
Star third baseman with the Atlanta Braves, will have his No. 10
jersey retired by the Major League Baseball team this summer.  The Braves will induct Jones, who retired after last
season, into its Hall of Fame and retire his number during a
ceremony on June 28, preceding a game against the Arizona
Diamondbacks, the team said in a statement.  Jones will be the ninth Braves’ player to have his number
retired and 25th person enshrined in the team’s hall.  Jones, 40, played his entire 18-year career with the
Braves, one year more than  Derek Jeter  and  Mariano Rivera  have
currently spent with the New York Yankees.  The No. 1 pick in the 1990 major-league draft, Jones is the
only switch-hitter in history with a .300 (.303) career batting
average and more than 300 home runs (468).  Jones was the National League’s Rookie of the Year in 1995,
when Atlanta won the World Series. He was named Most Valuable
Player in 1999 and won an NL batting title in 2008 with a .364
average.  Against the New York Mets, one of Atlanta’s top rivals
during his career, Jones had a .309 career average with 49 home
runs and 159 runs batted in. His 19 homers and 12 stolen bases
at Shea Stadium, the Mets’ former home, are the most in any
visiting ballpark. Jones named his son Shea in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
