Colt Resources Inc. , a mining
company, will sign two contracts with the Portuguese government
today to look for tungsten and gold in the north of the country,
the company said.  Colt, based in Montreal, expects to invest about 97 million
euros ($129 million) in its search for tungsten and gold
deposits in the towns of Tabuaco and Penedono, it said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The company signed a three-year exploration deal with the
government in 2011 to look for gold at Boa Fe, near the town of
Montemor, and plans to start production in early 2014, Chief
Executive Officer  Nikolas Perrault  said last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
