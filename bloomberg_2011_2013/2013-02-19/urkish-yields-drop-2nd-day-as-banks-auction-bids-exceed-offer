The lira depreciated the most in two
weeks and yields closed near record lows after the Turkish
central bank cut interest rates.  The currency lost the most among emerging-market peers
after the central bank reduced its overnight borrowing and
lending rates by 25 basis points each to 4.5 percent and 8.5
percent, respectively. Three of the six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg predicted the decision.  “The lira has weakened on the decision,”  Annika Lindblad ,
an analyst at Nordea Markets in Helsinki, said in an e-mailed
note. “The central bank will closely monitor the lira, being
wary of too much appreciation pressure especially from
speculative capital inflows.”  Turkey’s currency slid as much as 0.7 percent, its lowest
level since Jan. 7 on a closing basis, before paring its retreat
to 0.5 percent at 1.7759 a dollar by 5:21 p.m. in Istanbul. The
drop in the lira today is the most since Feb. 4, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields  dropped 10 basis points, or
0.1 percentage point, to 5.66 percent, one basis point off their
record low.  The central bank left its benchmark one-week repo rate
unchanged at 5.5 percent at the Monetary Policy Committee
meeting today. It increased the effective foreign-exchange
reserve requirement ratio to 11.5 percent from 11.1 percent,
withdrawing $940 million in liquidity from the market. The bank
also increased the effective lira reserve requirements to 11
percent from 10.8 percent for all maturities today.  Central Bank Governor  Erdem Basci  is looking to slow
inflation to 5 percent this year, while he seeks to curb loan
growth to 15 percent. Lending jumped 19.1 percent in the 12
months to Feb. 8, according to data published by the banking
regulator on Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
