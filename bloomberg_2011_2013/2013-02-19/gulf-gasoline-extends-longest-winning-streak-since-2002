U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline
strengthened for ninth consecutive day, extending its winning
streak to the longest since 2002 as Motiva Enterprises LLC was
said to shut a unit at its  Port Arthur, Texas, plant .  The refinery shut a fluid catalytic cracker overnight and
is now conducting unplanned repairs, according to a person
familiar with operations, who asked not to be identified because
the information isn’t public. The unexpected closing adds to
work being done on the plant’s delayed coker, sulfur recovery
unit and smallest of three crude units.  Refinery maintenance is also under way at  Phillips 66 ’s
Sweeny plant,  Exxon Mobil Corp. ’s Beaumont site and Alon USA
Energy Inc.’s  Big Spring facility , among others, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Together, combined with the Motiva
Port Arthur plant, the four refineries have a capacity of 1.26
million barrels a day, or about 14 percent of total  U.S. Gulf
Coast capacity .  Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  on the Gulf Coast
strengthened 2.75 cents to 0.25 cent below futures on the New
York Mercantile Exchange at 2:04 p.m. That’s the  ninth
consecutive gain , the longest string of gains since October
2002, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Reformulated
gasoline , or RBOB, advanced 8.75 cents to a premium of 7.75
cents, the highest level since Oct. 9.  “Chronic issues at Motiva’s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery,
as well as extended delays in ExxonMobil’s  Baytown, Texas ,
refinery, provided exceptional strength to U.S. Gulf Coast cash
markets,”  Thomas Finlon , director of Energy Analytics Group
Ltd., wrote in a weekly report.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the Gulf gained  0.38 cent  to
5.75 cents above heating oil futures, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  ‘Disproportionately High’  Crack spreads, or a measure of refining profitability,
should “bode very well” in the near term because of the
“disproportionately high maintenance schedules,” said Finlon,
who is based in Jupiter, Florida.  The 3-2-1 crack spread on the  Gulf Coast , measured by West
Texas Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped 65 cents to
$36.12 a barrel at 2:25 p.m., the first decline in five days.
The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil declined 99 cents
to $14.32 a barrel.  The New York Harbor 3-2-1 spread, measured using Brent oil
in Europe, was $14.31 a barrel, up from $14.08 Feb. 15.
 Reformulated  gasoline strengthened 0.38 cent to 2 cents below
futures, while ultra-low-sulfur diesel gained 0.12 cent to a
premium of 9.25 cents over heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
