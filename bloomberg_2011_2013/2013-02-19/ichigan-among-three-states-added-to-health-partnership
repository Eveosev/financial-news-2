Michigan ,  New Hampshire  and  West
Virginia  agreed to join with the U.S. federal government to
build exchanges where residents can buy subsidized health
insurance, the Department of Health and Human Services  said .  The additions bring the total to seven governors who will
rely on the federal partnerships in which the Obama
administration does most of the work to get the online
marketplaces off the ground by October.  North Carolina , which
previously said it would partner, dropped out. Sixteen other
states are building exchanges on their own, using federal money.  The exchanges, the core part of the 2010 U.S. health-care
overhaul, must be ready to start enrolling people by Oct. 1 for
plans that would take effect Jan. 1. Twenty-six states, most led
by Republican governors, have opted out, forcing the federal
government to fill the gap. Michigan Governor  Rick Snyder , a
Republican, chose the partnership because it can be “a useful
gateway” for residents to obtain affordable health coverage.  “A state-based exchange that provides the highest level of
customer service and is tailored to meet Michigan’s needs is the
optimal solution for our state,” Snyder said in a letter to the
government health agency.  Only six states led by Republican governors have agreed to
help build any part of the exchanges. Along with Michigan and
Utah, they are Nevada, New Mexico, Idaho and Iowa. Utah wants to
run its own exchange for small businesses and let the federal
government build a marketplace for individuals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
