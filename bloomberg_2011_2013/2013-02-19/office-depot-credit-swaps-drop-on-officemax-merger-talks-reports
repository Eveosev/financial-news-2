The cost of protecting  Office Depot
Inc.’s  debt from losses plunged to a record low following
reports that the second-largest office-supplies retailer in the
U.S. was in merger talks with  OfficeMax Inc.   Five-year credit-default swaps on the Boca Raton, Florida-
based company’s debt dropped 203 basis points to 301 basis
points as of 8:38 a.m. in New York, according to data provider
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Default swaps, which typically fall as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates, pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  The companies have been discussing a potential stock swap
that would create a single office-supply retailer to compete
with  Staples Inc. , according to a person familiar with the
matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
private. The merger would create a company with almost $18
billion in revenue, compared with $25 billion in revenue last
year for Staples.  The Wall Street Journal reported the talks yesterday on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
