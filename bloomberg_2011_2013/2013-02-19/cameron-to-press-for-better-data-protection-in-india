Prime Minister  David Cameron  will
today agree on a plan with his Indian counterpart,  Manmohan Singh , to step up the fight against cyber-crime as he seeks
better protection for U.K. data held on Indian computer servers.  Cameron will discuss practical steps with Singh on the
second day of a three-day visit to the South Asian nation,
seeking to protect data against attacks from criminal gangs,
terrorists and hostile states. Cameron is keen to share
knowledge with Indian authorities over the next year to bolster
cyber defenses.  “Other countries securing their data is effectively
securing our data,” Cameron told reporters before his meeting
with Singh in New Delhi today. “This is an area where Britain
has some competitive and technology advantages.”  In December, the British government identified “real and
growing threats to our interests in cyberspace” and  drew up
plans  to combat attacks on data. It cited a
PriceWaterhouseCoopers study showing that 93 percent of large
corporations and 76 percent of small businesses last year said
they had suffered a security breach.  “The threat comes from all sorts of different places and
organizations, a lot of which is criminal,” Cameron said.
“Hacking bothers me wherever it comes from,” he said, refusing
to single out any nation in particular.  Cameron and Singh will agree to create a body that shares
information affecting each country’s cyber space, according to
the U.K. prime minister’s office. Police officers will share
knowledge on forensic techniques and British security officials
will be given permission to work in India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
