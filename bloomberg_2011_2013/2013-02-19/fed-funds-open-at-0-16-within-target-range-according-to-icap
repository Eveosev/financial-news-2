Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.16 percent, within the Federal
Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.28 percent on Feb. 15 after trading
from 0.05 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.16 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire  $1.25 billion to $1.75
billion of Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to February
2043. The purchases are part of the Fed’s latest round of debt
purchases, known as quantitative easing, aimed to keep long-term
rates low and support economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
