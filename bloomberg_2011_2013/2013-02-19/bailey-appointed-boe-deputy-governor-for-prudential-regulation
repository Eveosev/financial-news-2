Andrew Bailey  will become deputy
governor for prudential regulation at the Bank of England as the
central bank prepares for its new role as Britain’s financial
regulator.  Bailey, currently managing director of the Financial
Services Authority’s Prudential Business Unit, will take up the
role on April 1, the Treasury said today in London. He will also
become chief executive officer of the new Prudential Regulatory
Authority. He took over as head of the PBU when  Hector Sants 
stepped down in June last year.  The newly created role is part of a regulatory shakeup
aimed at preventing another financial crisis. The plan also
involves scrapping the FSA and transferring its powers to the
central bank. Bailey will join  Paul Tucker , deputy governor for
financial stability, and  Charles Bean , who oversees monetary
policy, at the central bank.  “We have a big job ahead to ensure the U.K. has a stable
financial system,” Bailey said in a statement. “There have
been important and painful lessons from the financial crisis and
we must ensure that the U.K. has a successful system of
financial regulation.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said that
putting the Bank of England at the center of regulation is an
important measure.  “It will be a tough, forward-looking regulator, focused on
the stability of banks, other deposit takers and insurers -- and
with a mandate to protect policyholders,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
