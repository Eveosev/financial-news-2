Jamaica will seek bids from private
companies to manage the Norman Manley Airport near the capital
of Kingston.  The concession is expected to be in effect by 2014 and
follows the 2003 privatization of an airport at Montego Bay,
Jamaica’s government said in a  statement  today. Norman Manley
Airport handles 70 percent of the Caribbean island’s freight
traffic, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
