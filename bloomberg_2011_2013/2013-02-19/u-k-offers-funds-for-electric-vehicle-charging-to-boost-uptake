The U.K. government will offer 37
million pounds ($57 million) to fund charging points for plug-in
electric cars in a step to encourage consumers to buy vehicles
that pollute less.  The Department of Transport will provide 75 percent of the
cost of new power points installed by homes or local
authorities, according to a statement on its website. Train
stations can also tap funds for the charging points.  The funds, available until April 2015, are part of a 400
million-pound commitment from the government to boost cleaner
vehicles and reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050.
Transportation accounted for 21 percent of U.K. greenhouse gas
emissions in 2011, the second largest share after the energy
industry, government data show.  “Plug-in vehicles can help the consumer by offering a good
driving experience and low running costs,” Transport Secretary
 Patrick McLoughlin  said in the statement.  The sum includes 13.5 million pounds for homeowners wishing
to fit domestic charge points, 11 million pounds for local
authorities to install on-street charging and 9 million pounds
to fund points at railway stations, among others, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
