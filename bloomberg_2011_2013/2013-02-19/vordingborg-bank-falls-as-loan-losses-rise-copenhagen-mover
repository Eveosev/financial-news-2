Vordingborg Bank A/S , the lender
that dismissed its chief executive officer yesterday, fell the
most among stocks in Copenhagen trading after 2012 writedowns
helped erase earnings accumulated over the previous six years.  Vordingborg Bank fell 21 percent, the most since May 2004,
which made it today’s biggest loser in the  Copenhagen all-share
index . The stock retreated 59 kroner, to 223 kroner, at 12:26
p.m. in the Danish capital with trading volume at 44 times the
three-month daily average.  Danish regional banks are struggling to emerge from a burst
property bubble that’s forced the government resolution agency
to take over a dozen lenders since 2008 after losses on
commercial and agricultural loans wiped out capital. Concerns
lenders may have to take more writedowns amid a halting recovery
in the property market have weighed on Denmark’s smallest banks,
extending last year’s 7.3 percent loss in market value.  Vordingborg Bank, based in the city of the same name, said
yesterday the need for additional writedowns may result in a
2012 net loss of as much as 25 million kroner ($4.5 million).
The loss equals the combined net income of the six years through
2011, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Vordingborg Bank said yesterday that CEO  Ole Kuehnel  would
leave his position immediately and postponed the publication of
its 2012 earnings report to Feb. 28 from today.  Three of the five biggest losers in today’s Copenhagen
trading were regional banks. A Bloomberg index of Denmark’s 23
listed commercial banks with market capitalizations of 1 billion
kroner or less fell 0.2 percent today, bringing losses since the
start of the year to 6.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
