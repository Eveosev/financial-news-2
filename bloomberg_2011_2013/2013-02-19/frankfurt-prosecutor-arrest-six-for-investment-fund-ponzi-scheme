Frankfurt prosecutors conducted
about 130 raids in Germany that resulted in six arrests as part
of a probe into a Ponzi scheme they say resulted in losses for
about 1,000 investors.  About 1,200 officers raided locations in seven German
states today and more than 100 million euros ($134 million) was
frozen, prosecution spokeswoman  Doris Moeller-Scheu  said in an
e-mailed statement. The case centers on real-estate investment
company  Deutsche S&K Sachwert AG , she added, without identifying
any of the approximately 50 suspects.  Losses may total in the hundreds of millions of euros as
investors “sought a new profitable and safe investment
possibility in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis,” Moeller-
Scheu said.  Germany has intensified investigations into investor fraud.
In Munich last year, prosecutors led raids targeting stock
manipulators and won convictions on a scheme where small
investors were duped using a stock-exchange newsletter. In 2011,
a Wuerzburg court sentenced K1 Group founder  Helmut Kiener  to 10
years and eight months in jail for cheating investors in a 345
million-euro Ponzi scheme.  Efforts to reach S+K by phone were unsuccessful and the
company didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a Ponzi scheme, money from new clients is used to pay
off old ones rather than being invested.  To contact the reporter on this story:
