Jin Co. , whose sales of anti-glare
eyewear drove its stock up more than fourfold last year, said
revenue will reach 100 billion yen ($1.06 billion) by 2018, two
years earlier than it expected, helped by overseas expansion.  The company wants to triple the number of stores in Japan
to 500 and expand Chinese outlets 10-fold to 100 in five years,
and enter U.S. and European markets, said Chief Executive
Officer  Hitoshi Tanaka . Tokyo-based Jin trades at 31 times
estimated earnings, compared with an average 20 times for
companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Jin, which makes the Jins PC  eyewear  that reduces screen
brightness from computers and smartphones, surged 315 percent
last year, compared with a 14 percent gain in the Jasdaq Stock
Index. The company will be worth more than 1 trillion yen in 10
years, joining Japan’s largest companies including  Toyota Motor
Corp. ,  Nintendo Co.  and  Fast Retailing Co ., Tanaka said.  “Fast Retailing’s CEO  Tadashi Yanai  boosted the company’s
market capitalization by 1 trillion yen in 10 years, so I am
motivated to do the same,” Tanaka, 50, said in an interview on
Feb. 14.  Only 71 firms among the 3,500 listed companies in Japan
exceeded 1 trillion yen in market value as of Feb. 18, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Highest Close  Jin’s  shares  rose 8.9 percent to 3,975 yen today, after
surging as much as 14 percent. The stock closed at the highest
level since it debuted in August 2006.  “It’s unclear how long the PC glasses boom will last. It
may be transient,” said  Akira Iwasaki , an analyst at Iwai Cosmo
Securities Co. with an outperform on the stock. “It depends on
whether the company can make a paradigm shift and get people who
have good eyesight to wear these glasses. When people started
selling mineral water, most thought they could just manage with
tap water.”  The size of Japan’s eyewear market contracted by about a
fifth to 462 billion yen in 2011 from 2004 as contact lenses and
Lasik eye surgeries became popular, said Yutaka Minobe,
president of Tokyo-based Gankyo Publishing Co., which monitors
the industry’s trends.  “Prices have also been falling and the population is
shrinking,” Minobe said. “New products such as the PC glasses,
and special eyewear for pollen allergies and sports may help
revive the market among young people.”  Overseas Expansion  Jin sold 3.5 million glasses in 2012 and projects sales of
6 million units this year, Tanaka said.  Mizuho Financial Group
Inc.  and  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc . are advising the
company on its overseas expansion strategy, he said.  Still, “sales growth momentum will slacken from the next
fiscal year due to a slowdown for J!NS PC” glasses,  Natsumi Negishi  and  Yoshimasa Ikazaki , analysts at Daiwa Securities
Group Inc., wrote in a report dated Jan. 11. “The stock does
not seem undervalued even in view of expected profit growth
three years in the future.”  The analysts have a neutral rating on the stock.  Jin started in 1988 and now has about 1,500 employees. The
company on Jan. 10 raised its sales forecast to 32.3 billion yen
from 29.4 billion yen for the year ending Aug. 31, according to
a company statement. The profit estimate was increased to 2.4
billion yen from 1.8 billion yen for the period.  Toyota, with a market value of 16.5 trillion yen, forecasts
21.8 trillion yen in sales for the year ending March 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
