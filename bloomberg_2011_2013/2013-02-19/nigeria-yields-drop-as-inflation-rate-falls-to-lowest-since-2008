Borrowing costs on Nigeria’s $500
million of Eurobonds fell for a second day and local currency
yields declined to a record low after inflation eased to the
slowest in almost five years.  Yields on the dollar debt of Africa’s biggest oil producer
due January 2021 slipped less than one basis point to 4.358
percent as of 1:25 p.m. in London. Nigeria’s local currency debt
maturing January 2022 tumbled 29 basis points to a record low
10.51 percent, according to yesterday’s data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The nation’s  inflation  rate fell to 9 percent in January
from 12 percent in December, the lowest level since April 2008,
as the effect of a year-earlier reduction in fuel subsidies
dropped out of the calculation, the Abuja-based  National Bureau
of Statistics  said yesterday. Inflation is forecast to average
9.8 percent this year, the statistics office said.  “If trend is sustained, it is quite likely that there will
be sufficient headroom for policy makers to start easing
policy,”  Kojo Amoo-Gottfried , a London-based analyst at FM
Capital Partners Ltd., wrote in a note to clients today. “This
continues to bode well for the country and most likely means
that yields are going to come under sustained pressure.”  Nigeria’s economy will probably expand 6.8 percent this
year compared with growth of 6.6 percent in 2012, the statistics
bureau said. The  foreign-currency reserves  of Africa’s most
populous country have advanced 6 percent this year to $46.72
billion, the highest since at least 2010, according to Feb. 15
data compiled by the central bank.  “Given that oil continues to remain high, the country’s
overall creditworthiness continues to improve,” said Amoo-
Gottfried. “With growth expected to rise to 6.8 percent, even
without easing policy, there is the possibility that the economy
may end up being one of the star performers on the continent so
long as political issues and oil prices remain supportive.”  The naira gained less than 0.1 percent to 157.4 a dollar.
Ghana’s cedi fell a second day, weakening 0.2 percent to 1.9035
per dollar in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
