Swedenâ€™s krona strengthened against
both the dollar and euro after unemployment was unchanged in
January, easing pressure on the central bank to cut interest
rates.  The krona strengthened 0.2 percent against the euro to
8.4524 and appreciated 0.2 percent versus the dollar to 6.3309
as of 9:56 a.m. in Stockholm.  Seasonally-adjusted unemployment held at 8 percent in
January compared with an estimate 8.2 percent in a Bloomberg
survey of 8 economists, Statistics Sweden said. Annual headline
consumer prices were unchanged in the month, after declining 0.1
percent the prior month, in line with a survey of 11 economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
