The U.S. Supreme Court buttressed
the power of federal antitrust authorities, ruling that the
Federal Trade Commission can challenge a Georgia hospital
acquisition.  The justices, voting unanimously, today said a government
body’s involvement in the purchase of  HCA Holdings Inc. ’s
Palmyra facility didn’t immunize the accord from antitrust
scrutiny.  The FTC contends the deal reduced competition because the
public entity that made the purchase, the Hospital Authority of
Albany-Dougherty County, also owns the county’s only other
hospital, Phoebe Putney Memorial.  The Supreme Court today said the hospital authority
couldn’t claim the antitrust immunity that government agencies
have in other contexts because Georgia lawmakers hadn’t
indicated they wanted to allow anticompetitive hospital
acquisitions.  “There is no evidence the state affirmatively contemplated
that hospital authorities would displace competition by
consolidating hospital ownership,” Justice  Sonia Sotomayor 
wrote for the court.  FTC Chairman  Jon Leibowitz  called the ruling “a big
victory for consumers who want to see lower health care costs.”  The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Phoebe Putney,
11-1160.  To contact the reporter on this story:
