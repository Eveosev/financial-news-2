Wheat production in India, the
world’s second-biggest producer, may match last year’s record as
cooler temperature and winter rains in the main growing regions
boost yields, according to a millers’ group.  The harvest in the crop year that began on July 1 may equal
94.9 million metric tons estimated by the government for the
2011-2012 season, Veena Sharma, secretary of the Roller Flour
Millers Federation of India, said in a phone interview today.
The farm ministry estimates output this year to drop for the
first time in eight years to 92.3 million tons after a below-
average monsoon.  Temperatures fell in the main wheat growing areas in
India’s northern regions after a spell of rains between Feb. 15
and Feb. 16, said K.K. Singh, head of the agromet division of
the India Meteorological Department. The cold wind that followed
the rains will be beneficial for wheat, he said.  “As the region has been receiving rains from time to time
this winter, wheat crop is not suffering from moisture stress as
well as temperature deviation,” Singh said.  Planting dropped to 29.8 million hectares (73.7 million
acres) this year from 29.9 million hectares a year earlier, the
farm ministry said Feb. 15.  The government, the single biggest buyer of food grains in
India, plans to buy a record 44 million tons of wheat from
farmers this season, compared with 38.2 million tons a year
earlier, the food ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
