Ford Motor Co.  will pay a bonus to
Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  after his employment ends
as reward for leading the second-largest U.S. automaker through
its turnaround.  The payment will be based on Ford’s contributions to
Mulally’s company retirement and benefit equalization plans, the
Dearborn, Michigan-based company said today in a regulatory
filing. Ford reported net income of $5.67 billion for 2012 and
its shares climbed 20 percent, outpacing the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index’s 13 percent rise.  The agreement for the payment was dated Feb. 13 and is “a
clarification of a prior agreement,”  Jay Cooney , a company
spokesman, said in an interview. “Nothing has changed.” No
amounts were disclosed in the accord.  Ford reclaimed investment-grade  credit ratings  and paid out
its first  dividend  since 2006 on the strength of its namesake
brand, the only vehicle line to top 2 million U.S. sales last
year. Mulally, 67, has instituted a global product development
plan called One Ford to boost profits by selling the same models
globally, rather than different versions for various regions.  Ford has earned $35.2 billion the past four years after
losing $30.1 billion from 2006 through 2008. Executive Chairman
 Bill Ford  elevated  Mark Fields  to chief operating officer in
December from president of the Americas, positioning the 23-year
veteran of the company to succeed Mulally after 2014.  The shares fell 0.2 percent to $12.99 at the close in New
York.  Venezuelan Decision  Mulally’s compensation for 2012, including salary and
benefits, will be revealed later this year in the company’s
proxy statement. Ford rewarded Mulally with stock worth $58.3
million in March of last year and $56.6 million a year earlier.  Ford also provided some detail on the Venezuelan
government’s Feb. 8 decision to devalue its currency to an
exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar and the effect
that move will have on the automaker’s operations in the
country.  Ford had $620 million in net monetary assets denominated in
Venezuelan bolivars as of the end of last year, according to
today’s filing. Ford would have recorded a translation loss of
about $200 million in its year-end financial statements had the
devaluation occurred before the end of last year, the company
said.  “Our ability to obtain funds at the official exchange rate
has been limited,” Ford said in the filing. “Continuing
restrictions on the foreign currency exchange market could
affect our Venezuelan operations’ ability to pay obligations
denominated in U.S. dollars as well as our ability to benefit
from those operations.”  Employment Rises  The automaker also reported that North American automotive
employment increased to 80,000 at the end of 2012 from 75,000 a
year earlier. South American jobs rose to 17,000 from 16,000
while Europe, where industry sales reached a 19-year-low in
2012, fell to 46,000 from 47,000. Total Ford employment
increased 4.3 percent to 171,000.  Rising demand for F-Series pickups in Ford’s home market
paced a record $8.34 billion annual pretax profit for the
company’s operations in North America, which countered overseas
losses.  The North American results also will lead to profit sharing
of about $8,300 on average to Ford’s 45,300 hourly workers
represented by the United Auto Workers union, a record payout
that will occur next month.  General Motors Co. , the largest U.S.
automaker, is paying its hourly workers as much as $6,750, while
Chrysler Group LLC’s will get about $2,250.  Ford began paying a quarterly dividend of 5 cents a share
in March of last year and moved last month to double the payout.
Moody’s Investors Service raised Ford to investment grade in May
after Fitch Ratings lifted the company to the status in April.
Standard & Poor’s ranks Ford’s debt BB+, the highest level of
speculative grade, with a positive outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
