Companies in Asia are approaching
banks with the biggest syndicated loans in five years to fund
acquisitions and refinance debt as interest rates fall.  Commodities trader  Noble Group Ltd.  and  San Miguel Corp. 
lead 17 borrowers in the market in Asia-Pacific outside Japan
seeking as much as $11.03 billion of bank debt, according to
people familiar with the plans. That’s on top of the $17.7
billion from 63 deals already signed since Dec. 31, giving an
average transaction size of $359.6 million, the most since the
same period of 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Borrowing costs are falling as bond-buying by global
central banks to stimulate the world economy boosts the supply
of cash in the financial system. Average interest margins over
the London interbank offered rate for dollar loans in Asia fell
36.6 basis points to 252.7 basis points in the second half of
2012 from the first six months of the year, Bloomberg data show.  “Corporate treasurers are starting to invest for growth as
loan prices get lower,” said  Mikio Tanuma , the general manager
of syndications in Asia at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
“Globally there’s enough liquidity and so companies are
bringing bigger-sized deals to market.”  ‘Jumbo’ Loans  Lenders can expect more “jumbo” deals as Asian companies
expand by buying businesses both within the region and in the
U.S. and Europe, where asset valuations are attractive,
Singapore-based Tanuma said.  Dealmaking globally surged this year to $291.2 billion led
by H.J. Heinz Co.’s $23 billion takeover by Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. and 3G Capital Inc., a 20 percent jump from the same period
of 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Citic Telecom International Holdings Ltd. is raising $1.25
billion via a two-part financing from about eight banks for its
proposed 79 percent stake purchase of Companhia de
Telecomunicacoes de Macau from Cable & Wireless Communications
Plc and Portugal Telecom SGPS SA, Chief Financial Officer David
Chan said in a Jan. 17 e-mail.  San Miguel, a century-old brewer that has diversified into
the oil, airline, electricity and gas industries to become the
Philippines’ largest company by sales, is seeking a loan of as
much as $1.5 billion to help refinance debt, a person familiar
with the matter said earlier this month. A facility that size
would be the company’s largest since 2009, Bloomberg data show.  San Miguel  “We’re seeing a stronger pipeline so far this year, with a
number of sizeable refinancings,” said  Oscar Tang , the head of
loan syndications at Shanghai Pudong Development Bank’s Hong
Kong unit. “New money deals” will only help that trend, he
said.  Noble, Asia’s biggest publicly listed commodity trader, has
approached lenders for a $2 billion two-part loan and plans to
offer all-in rates of as much as 40 basis points lower than what
it paid for its $2.36 billion borrowing which closed in 2012, a
person familiar with the matter said Feb. 8.  Cargill Inc. hired seven banks for a $1 billion, 364-day
revolving credit facility to refinance a $1.25 billion loan
signed in March last year, according to a Feb. 7 e-mailed
statement from Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., one of the
arranging lenders.  Hibor Margins  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. meanwhile is inviting its
relationship banks to participate in a HK$5 billion ($645
million) five-year syndicated loan to partly refinance its
HK$15.25 billion facility which matures this year, three people
familiar with the matter said Jan. 8. The developer, which also
operates hotels and manages carparks, is offering an interest
margin of about 138 basis points over the Hong Kong interbank
offered rate, the people said.  Hong Kong-dollar denominated loans signed in the second
half of 2012 paid an average margin of 278.6 basis points over
Hibor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With Hibor at
 0.385 percent , the rate Sun Hung Kai is offering to pay is still
228 basis points less than the 4.04 percent weighted averaged
fixed coupon the company is paying on its bonds.  Although conditions are “very favorable” in the loans
market, bonds do continue to detract from total volumes, said
 Phil Lipton , the Asia-Pacific head of syndicated finance at HSBC
Holdings Plc.  Yields Increase  Bond sales in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan surged last year
to a record $208.9 billion as yields tumbled to all-time lows,
while syndicated loan volumes fell 18 percent to $377.8 billion
from 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Loans signed
last month total $15.7 billion, a 28 percent increase on the
$12.3 billion of facilities completed in January 2012, the data
show.  The spread investors demand to own dollar bonds in Asia
over government debt has increased six basis points this year to
266.6 basis points Feb. 15, HSBC indexes show. Yields, which
touched 3.352 percent on Oct. 16, the least in data going back
to 1996, were 3.654 percent Feb. 15, the data show.  “Asia’s syndication loan market had a relatively stable
year in 2012,” SMBC’s Tanuma said. “This year’s outlook may be
a bit better given there are bigger size deals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
