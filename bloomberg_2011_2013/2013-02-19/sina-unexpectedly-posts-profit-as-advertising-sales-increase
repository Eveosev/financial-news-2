Sina Corp. (SINA) , owner of  China ’s largest
Twitter-like service, unexpectedly posted a fourth-quarter
profit as advertising sales increased.  Net income fell to $2.36 million from $9.28 million a year
earlier, the New York-listed company said in a statement today.
Analysts had expected a $900,000 loss, based on the average of
seven  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 4.3 percent
from a year earlier to $139.1 million.  Sina has boosted spending on development as the more than
400 million users of its Weibo micro-blog service increasingly
post from mobile devices rather than personal computers. China’s
slower growth has also damped advertising, hitting earnings at
online companies including  Baidu (BIDU)  Inc. and Sohu.com Inc. Sina’s
ad sales increased 7 percent to $110.7 million.  “Weibo needs a lot of development and money, especially
for the advertising-promotion system,” Ma  Yuan , a Hong Kong-
based analyst at Bocom International Holdings, said before the
announcement. She rates Sina neutral.  Sina predicted first-quarter non-GAAP sales of $115 million
to $119 million, including advertising revenue of $94 million to
$96 million, according to the statement.  Baidu, the operator of China’s largest search engine,
posted the slowest profit growth in almost four years in the
quarter ended December. Fourth-quarter net income at Sohu.com
fell 9 percent, according to a Feb. 4 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
