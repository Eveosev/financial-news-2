Brazil’s proposal to accelerate the
sale of ports to private companies is sparking an
“exaggerated” reaction by workers that won’t succeed in
changing plans, President Dilma Rouseff’s Chief of Staff said.  The government proposal to sell 159 port terminals to
investors by the end of 2014 will cut shipping costs by allowing
for more competition, Chief of Staff  Gleisi Hoffmann  said in an
interview today in Brasilia.  Port union leaders in Brazil, the largest exporter of sugar
and orange juice, are protesting the plan to cede control over
ports, saying it will cause dismissals. After seizing a Chinese
ship at Santos yesterday, workers are threatening to stop all
work at the same port for six hours on Feb. 22. President  Dilma Rousseff  has instructed officials to resist union pressure and
continue with the program, which seeks to attract 54.2 billion
reais ($27.7 billion) in private port investments.  “We respect unions and the right to strike, but at this
time, they are exaggerated,” Hoffmann said today. “We will not
allow ports with high costs and without competition.”  Government officials and labor representatives will resume
talks this Friday to negotiate modifications to the proposal.  The government port auction process will be trimmed to six
months from as long as three years as the government tries to
boost economic growth by improving the country’s infrastructure,
Hoffmann said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
