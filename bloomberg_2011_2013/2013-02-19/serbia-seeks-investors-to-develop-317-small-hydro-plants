Serbia offered 317 locations for
building small hydro plants, giving investors until April 5 to
apply for permits.  The facilities planned in nine municipalities in central,
western and southeastern Serbia will be mostly smaller than 1
megawatt individual capacity, according to the invitation
published in  Politika  newspaper.  The country seeks to boost power output and increase use of
renewables as it needs to improve its energy mix by 2020. Last
month, it increased the incentives, the so-called feed-in
tariffs, for power made in small hydro plants, to between 7.4
euro cents and 13.7 euro cents per kilowatt hour, depending on
size of plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
