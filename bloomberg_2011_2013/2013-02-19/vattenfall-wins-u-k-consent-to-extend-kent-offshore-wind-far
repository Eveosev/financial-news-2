The U.K. government said it approved
Vattenfall AB’s plans to extend an offshore wind farm near Kent,
adding 17 turbines to a facility that already has 30.  “As well as providing large amounts of clean energy,
offshore wind will support jobs and generate major investment up
and down the country,” Energy Secretary Ed Davey said in a
statement released by his office in London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
