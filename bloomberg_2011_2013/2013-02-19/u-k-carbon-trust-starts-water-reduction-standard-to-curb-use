The U.K. Carbon Trust, an adviser to
governments and businesses on reducing emissions, set up a water
reduction standard for companies to curb use of the resource.  The standard was needed because just one in seven of 475
businesses surveyed from the U.K. to South Korea had targets for
water reduction or reported on water performance, the company
said today in an e-mailed statement.  It comes a month after water scarcity was termed the
second-most important global risk at the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, by UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
