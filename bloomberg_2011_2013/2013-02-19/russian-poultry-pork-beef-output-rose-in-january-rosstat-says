Russia produced more beef, pork and
poultry in January compared with the year earlier period,
government figures showed.  Pork production gained almost 26 percent from a year
earlier to 79,900 metric tons, while beef rose 6.5 percent to
12,200 tons, and poultry and its byproducts were 9.7 percent
higher at 292,000 tons, the Federal State Statistics Service,
known as Rosstat, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Cattle and poultry output by so-called live weight, which
includes skin, bones and byproducts, rose 9 percent to 900,000
tons in January, according to Rosstat.  There were 20 million head in Russiaâ€™s cattle herd by the
end of January, or 0.6 percent less than a year earlier. The
number of cows dropped 0.9 percent to 8.9 million. Hogs gained
10 percent to 19.2 million and sheep and goats advanced 5.9
