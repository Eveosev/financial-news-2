PT Pertamina, Indonesia’s state-
owned oil company, issued a tender to buy low-sulfur crude for
delivery in April for its Balikpapan and Cilacap refineries.  The tender closes Feb. 21, with bids valid until the next
day, according to a company official, who asked not to be named
because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
