The yuan dropped to a two-month low
as China weakened the currency’s reference rate for a second day
amid concern exports will be hurt by the yen’s 13 percent tumble
against the dollar in the past three months.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the daily yuan  fixing  by
0.01 percent to 6.2821 per dollar, after setting it 0.04 percent
weaker yesterday. The yen, which touched a 33-month low of 94.46
per dollar on Feb. 11, will fall to 100 by the end of the year,
ING Groep NV predicted this week. The Japanese currency rose 0.5
percent today.  “Officials are still cautious on the currency with the
prospect of a weaker yen,” said  Daniel Chan , a Hong Kong-based
executive vice president at Glory Sky Global Markets Ltd.  The yuan fell 0.03 percent to close at 6.2443 per dollar in
Shanghai, prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System
show. The currency touched 6.2454 earlier, the lowest level
since Dec. 14. Spot prices are allowed to diverge a maximum 1
percent from the daily reference rate.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.278 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency slipped 0.13
percent to 6.2405 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.09
percent to 6.3248 per dollar, a 1.3 percent discount to the
onshore spot rate.  Draining Funds  The PBOC drained 30 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) from the
financial system today via 28-day repurchase contracts,
according to a trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions. That’s the first time in eight months that the central
bank took money out of the market.  Consumer prices will climb 3.1 percent this year, after a
2.65 percent increase in 2012, according to a Bloomberg survey
of economists.  “A stronger exchange rate is in China’s favor as it lowers
imported prices and inflationary pressure,” said Chan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
