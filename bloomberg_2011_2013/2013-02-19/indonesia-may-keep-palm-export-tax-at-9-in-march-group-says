Indonesia, the largest palm oil
producer, may keep the duty on shipments of the crude variety
unchanged at 9 percent in March, double the rate in Malaysia.  The March rate will probably be kept unchanged as the
reference price is still about $849 a metric ton,  Steaven Halim ,
an official at the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, said in an
e-mailed statement. The base price for calculating the levy
exporters must pay may climb to $777 a ton from $744, he said.  “Indonesia is still less competitive against Malaysia,”
said  Hariyanto Wijaya , an analyst at PT Mandiri Sekuritas in
Jakarta. The position is set to “improve slightly compared with
this month because the gap will narrow.”  Malaysia, the second-biggest supplier, raised the duty for
crude palm exports to 4.5 percent in March from zero in January
and February, according to a customs statement posted on the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board website on Feb. 15. Indonesia raised
the duty to 9 percent this month from 7.5 percent in January.  The Malaysian government said in October it would reduce
the export tax from January to drain record stockpiles.  Reserves 
slid 1.9 percent to 2.58 million tons last month from a record
2.63 million tons in December. Indonesia’s inventories will
probably shrink 14 percent to 3 million tons this month,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
