Vueling Airlines SA , the Spanish
discount carrier that has almost 70 Airbus SAS A320-series jets,
said fleet-renewal talks are proceeding, with a switch to rival
planes from  Boeing Co.  or Bombardier Inc. a possibility.  Barcelona-based Vueling is examining the re-engined A320
neo and 737 Max models from  Airbus  and Boeing, together with
 Bombardier ’s new CSeries jet, Chief Commercial Officer Julio
Rodriguez said today in an interview in Frankfurt.  “We’ll have to look at which plane makes most economic
sense,” he said, adding that a mixed fleet might be viable.
Chief Executive Officer  Alex Cruz  said in July that the carrier
needed at least 60 aircraft to renew the fleet and add capacity.  Vueling, founded in 2004, will boost traffic to Scandinavia
and Germany this year, according to Rodriguez. The latter is
likely to be its fastest-growing market as the passenger total
triples to more than 1 million after the addition of six cities
including Frankfurt, Hanover and Stuttgart from March 23.  Revenue at the company, which is the target of a takeover
bid from British Airways-owner  International Consolidated
Airlines Group SA , will this year increase to “well over” 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion), from just under 1 billion euros in
2012, the executive said. The carrier last year added flights to
German destinations including Berlin and Munich.  Vueling’s fleet will reach 70 leased planes this year
following the arrival of eight A320s, with more due in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
