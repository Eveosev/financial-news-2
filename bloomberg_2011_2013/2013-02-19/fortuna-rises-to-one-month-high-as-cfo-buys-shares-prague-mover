Fortuna Entertainment Group NV , a
Czech betting company, rose to the highest in a month after
saying Chief Financial Officer Michal Veprek bought shares.  The stock gained for a second day, climbing as much as 1.4
percent to 88.80 koruna and trading at 88 koruna by 11:35 a.m.
in Prague, the highest since Jan. 18. Fortuna is up 3.5 percent
this year, compared with a 3.9 percent retreat for the country’s
benchmark  PX  index.  Veprek bought 4,000 shares between Jan. 10 and Feb. 15, the
Amsterdam-registered company said late on Feb. 15. The CFO, who
previously held none of the stock, now owns 0.008 percent of
total capital, according to the regulatory filing. The company
is scheduled to publish 2012 earnings in two weeks.  The “purchase of own shares by management is a positive
signal for the stock,” analysts led by  Milan Vanicek  at J&T
Banka AS in Prague wrote in a report to clients today. J&T has a
buy recommendation for Fortuna, with a 136 koruna price
estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
