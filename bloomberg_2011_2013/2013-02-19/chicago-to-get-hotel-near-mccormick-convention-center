Illinois’s Metropolitan Pier and
Exposition Authority plans to build a $400 million hotel near
Chicago’s McCormick Place convention center to boost the
property’s trade-show business.  The proposed hotel south of downtown will have 1,200 rooms
and create 500 permanent jobs, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the exposition authority, Illinois Governor
 Pat Quinn , and Chicago Mayor  Rahm Emanuel . The authority, known
as McPier, owns McCormick Place, the Hyatt Regency McCormick
Place Hotel and Navy Pier, Chicago’s top tourist attraction.  The full-service hotel will be built between Indiana and
Michigan avenues, along the south side of Cermak Road, according
to the statement. It will help  McCormick Place  add about 15
events each year with a projected 80,000 attendees.  “This new hotel will help us make the case why our state
should be the first choice of any show anywhere, which will fuel
our continued  economic recovery  and put more people to work,”
Quinn said in the statement.  McPier is a municipal corporation created by the state’s
General Assembly. Its board is appointed by the governor of
Illinois and the mayor of Chicago, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
