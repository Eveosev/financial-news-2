P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LP,
which represents about 2 percent of  MetroPCS Communications Inc. 
shares, took steps to ask other investors to oppose the phone
company’s merger with  Deutsche Telekom AG ’s T-Mobile USA.  P. Schoenfeld Asset Management, which said its clients own
8.3 million MetroPCS shares, filed preliminary proxy materials
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 15 in
order to solicit proxies in opposition of the transaction,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  Deutsche Telekom in October agreed to merge T-Mobile with
MetroPCS in exchange for a 74 percent stake in the combined
entity, boosting resources to help T-Mobile compete with market
leaders Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc. The companies have said
they expect the deal to be completed in the second quarter,
following approval by MetroPCS shareholders. P. Schoenfeld Asset
Management last week gained an ally in Paulson & Co., whose 8.7
percent stake at the end of 2012 made it the biggest shareholder
in the pre-paid wireless operator.  The new company “is not appropriately and fairly
capitalized,” while the interest rate on a shareholder loan
from Deutsche Telekom is “far above market” given its
anticipated credit rating, and “the exchange ratio is unfair to
PCS stockholders,” P. Schoenfeld Asset Management said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
