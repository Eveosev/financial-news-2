Thailand, the world’s biggest rubber
producer, will review a program to support prices by purchasing
the commodity from farmers when it expires at the end of March,
said Deputy Farm Minister  Yuttapong Charasathien .  “Prices have stabilized, while supplies in Thailand are
limited,” said Yuttapong by phone today. The government has 20
billion baht ($699 million) left in the budget allocated for the
program, after buying 198,000 metric tons since last year, and
has no immediate plans to sell its stockpiles, he said.  Rubber traded in Tokyo slumped today by the most in more
than three months on speculation the country may end the program,
boosting shipments. Futures rallied 15 percent last year on
prospects of increasing demand as China and the U.S. recover and
as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, the top suppliers, agreed
to cut exports by a combined 300,000 tons.  “This is a bearish factor,” said  Kazunori Kokubo ,
managing director at Yutaka Shoji Singapore Pte, referring to
the possibility that Thailand may terminate the purchases.  The country introduced the program in May, allocating a
total budget of 45 billion baht to state agencies and farmer
cooperatives to buy rubber from farmers at above-market prices.  Rubber for delivery in July tumbled 3 percent to settle at
314.6 yen a kilogram ($3,361 a ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange, the largest loss at close for the most-active contract
since Nov. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
