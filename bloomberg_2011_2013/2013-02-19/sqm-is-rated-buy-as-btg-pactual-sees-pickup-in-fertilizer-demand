Soc. Quimica y Minera de Chile SA,
Chile’s largest fertilizer producer, may rise 22 percent a year
from now as a recovery in fertilizer demand leads to an increase
in profits, according to Grupo BTG Pactual.  BTG Pactual resumed  coverage  of the Santiago-based company
with a buy rating and a 12-month price target of $69.30 per
American depositary receipt, it said in an e-mailed note to
clients today. The bank also cited the company’s plans to expand
its iodine and lithium production for its recommendation.  “SQM is poised to deliver earnings growth starting in
2014,” BTG analysts  Cesar Perez-Novoa  and  Alex Sadzawka  wrote.
“Nitrate prices agreed in January and February with the Chinese
and Indian government were down year-on-year, but should
stimulate demand starting in late 2013.”  Shares were little changed at 26,900 pesos at 1:14 p.m. in
Santiago. Its  ADRs  advanced 0.5 percent to $56.87, snapping two
days of losses.  The ADRs trade at a trailing price-to-earnings  ratio  of
22.5 times, compared with the average 15.2 times for its global
peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
