Crude oil options volatility
increased as the underlying futures gained the most in a week
after operators said the flow of crude on the Seaway pipeline
will climb.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, rose to 19.55 percent at 5:30 p.m. on the New
York Mercantile Exchange from 19.45 percent Feb. 15.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery gained 69
cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $97.10 a barrel on the
Nymex. Enterprise Products Partners LP said Seaway volumes will
average 295,000 barrels a day between February and May, from
180,000 barrels in January. Traders are counting on the pipeline
to cut a supply glut at Cushing, Oklahoma, where Nymex futures
are delivered.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
April $80 puts, which dropped 3 cents to 5 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,239 contracts as of 5:30 p.m. April $90 puts were
the second-most active with 2,323 lots. They declined 11 cents
to 44 cents.  Puts accounted for 63 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the previous session, bearish bets made up 52 percent of the
154,611 contracts traded.  April $100 calls were the most active options traded Feb.
15, with 7,755 contracts changing hands. They slid 23 cents to
67 cents a barrel. April $85 puts gained 4 cents to 21 cents a
barrel on 6,485 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
33,475 contracts. Next were April $110 calls at 33,034 and
December $110 calls at 30,319.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
