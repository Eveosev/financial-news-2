Sealed Air Corp. , the maker of
Bubble Wrap, rose the most in more than four years after
quarterly earnings and sales beat analysts’ estimates as the
company shipped a larger volume of products.  Sealed Air  gained  11 percent to $21.54 at 11:24 a.m. in New
York after rising as much as 14 percent, the biggest intraday
increase since November 2008 and the second-largest gain today
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 index.  Fourth-quarter net profit excluding debt redemption costs
and other one-time items was 34 cents a share, the Elmwood Park,
New Jersey-based company said today in a statement. The average
of 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 29 cents. Sales rose
0.8 percent to $1.98 billion, surpassing the $1.94 billion
average of nine estimates. Sealed air said its volumes climbed
2.6 percent.  “We are encouraged volumes were positive across all its
segments and margins improved,”  Philip Ng , an analyst at
Jefferies & Co. Inc. in New York who recommends buying the
stock, said in a note today.  Bubble Wrap  is a transparent plastic film with air pockets
sealed between two layers, used to cushion fragile items in
shipping.  To contact the reporter on this story:
