Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index headed for its highest close in 18 months, as
Bridgestone Corp. surged the most in four years after raising
its profit forecast. Gains were limited on concern China may act
to cool the property market.  Bridgestone, the world’s biggest tiremaker, soared 10
percent in Tokyo. China Resources Land Ltd. dropped 4.4 percent
in Hong Kong.  Nissan Motor Co. , a Japanese carmaker that gets 79
percent of its revenue abroad, fell 1.1 percent as the yen
strengthened after Finance Minister Taro Aso ruled out foreign
bond buying. Gree Inc., a social-network website operator, rose
2.7 percent on a plan to buy back shares.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.2 percent to 133.98 as
of 7:28 p.m. in Tokyo, with eight of 10 industry groups
climbing. The measure is headed for the highest close since Aug.
2, 2011. The Hang Seng Composite Property & Construction Index
dropped 1.8 percent in Hong Kong.  “Earnings have been mixed with auto-related companies
doing better,” said  Kazuyuki Terao , Tokyo-based chief
investment officer of Allianz Global Investors Japan Co., part
of Allianz Global Investors which oversees about 302 billion
euros ($403 billion). “Stocks may give up some gains as the
market discounts expectations for foreign bond buying. Yet, the
Bank of Japan will still do aggressive monetary easing once a
new governor comes in.”  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 9.7 percent from the
start of November through yesterday, led by Japanese shares as
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to beat deflation and pressed
the central bank to ease monetary policy. Asia’s benchmark
trades at 14.9 times estimated earnings compared with 13.7 for
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  and 12.3 for the  Stoxx Europe
600 Index , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said today
that Abe will consider nominations to replace Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa after his Feb. 22 summit with
President Barack Obama. Shirakawa steps down March 19.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.3 percent after
minutes of last month’s BOJ meeting said the nation’s economy
remains relatively weak. South Korea’s  Kospi Index  added 0.2
percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.4 percent as
minutes of the central bank’s latest meeting said there are
indications that lower rates are starting to spur growth. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.7 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.6 percent, the most since Jan.
11.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index  rose 0.2 percent, and Singapore’s
Straits Times Index increased 0.2 percent.  Earnings Results  Of the 340 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have reported quarterly earnings and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 51 percent exceeded profit expectations. That
compares with 71 percent of S&P 500 companies that topped profit
forecasts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bridgestone jumped 10 percent to 2,820 yen, the biggest
gain on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, after yesterday saying net
income will probably jump 37 percent to 235 billion yen ($2.5
billion) in 2013 amid a decline in raw-material costs and a
weaker yen.  Gree gained 2.7 percent to 1,154 yen after saying it will
buy back as much as 1 percent of its shares for 3 billion yen.
The company also said it will develop social-network games with
Yahoo Japan Corp.  AU Optronics Corp., a maker of transistor-liquid crystal
displays, rose 6.6 percent to NT$12.85 in Taipei, extending
yesterday’s gain, after saying shipments and prices for larger
panels will rise.  Bumi Extends Gains  Bumi Resources Tbk, Indonesia’s largest thermal coal
producer, jumped 7.5 percent to 1,000 rupiah, extending
yesterday’s 9.4 percent surge. A bid by Nathaniel Rothschild to
oust the board of Bumi Plc at a meeting this week may force the
company to buy out shareholders in the Indonesian subsidiary,
Indonesia’s financial services regulator said.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. U.S. equity markets will reopen today from a holiday.  Developers fell in Hong Kong after China Business News

more policies to curb real estate prices around the National
People’s Congress annual session next month.  China Resources Land sank 4.4 percent to HK$21.50. China
Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. retreated 3.3 percent to
HK$21.95.  Japan’s Aso said the government is not considering any
immediate change to laws governing the BOJ and has no intention
of buying foreign bonds through a public-private fund,
contradicting comments from Abe.  Yen Strengthens  Japanese exporters fell as the yen gained against all of
its 16 major counterparts following Aso’s comments. Nissan slid
1.1 percent to 940 yen.  Panasonic Corp. , an electronics company
that generates 47 percent of its revenue outside Japan, lost 0.5
percent to 664 yen.  Sonic Healthcare Ltd., a medical diagnostics company,
tumbled 8.5 percent to A$12.85 in Sydney after saying  first-
half net income was A$150.6 million ($156 million), falling
short of estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
