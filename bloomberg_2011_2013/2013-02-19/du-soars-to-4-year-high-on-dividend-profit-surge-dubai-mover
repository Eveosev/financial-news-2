Du rallied to the highest level in
more than four years after the United Arab Emirates phone
operator proposed a higher cash dividend and more than doubled
fourth-quarter profit.  Shares of  Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Co. , as
the operator is formally known, rose 12 percent to 4.12 dirhams,
the highest level since November 2008, at the close in Dubai.
The stock was the biggest advancer on the benchmark  DFM General
Index , which gained 1.7 percent. About 18 million shares were
traded, more than 10 times the three-month daily average. Du
proposed a 30 fils a share cash dividend, double what it paid
last year.  “The most attractive part of the news is the 30 percent
cash dividend, which translates into a yield of above 8 percent
at last close,” said  Talal Touqan , head of research at Al Ramz
Securities LLC in Abu Dhabi. “The second booster was their
market share.”  Du, which competes in the U.A.E. with Emirates
Telecommunications Corp., known as Etisalat, added almost half a
million customers in the period, boosting its market share to
48.7 percent, it said. Fourth-quarter net income after royalty
to the government soared to 994 million dirhams ($271 million)
from 440 million dirhams in the year-earlier period. That beat
the 795 million-dirham  median estimate  of three analysts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dubai Recovery  Phone companies in the U.A.E. are benefiting from a
recovery in Dubai, whose economy probably expanded 5 percent in
2012, the fastest pace since 2007, according to government
estimates.  Du’s stock rose  21 percent last year as the emirate’s
tourism, hotel and restaurant industries improved. That outpaced
the 20 percent advance for the benchmark. Du has a  12-month
dividend yield  of 3.6 percent, compared with 3.3 percent for the
 DFM General Index.   The U.A.E. government late last year raised royalty fees on
Du, prompting speculation earnings may suffer. The company,
which is required to pay 17.5 percent of profit and 5 percent of
revenue in royalties for 2012, said today it had provisioned for
royalty payment at 50 percent. The provisioning boosted
quarterly earnings by more than 140 million dirhams, Touqan
added.  Payments to the government will rise incrementally in the
next four years, with the ratio reaching 30 percent of profit
and 12.5 percent of revenue in 2015, the government said in
December. The stock trades at a 2013  price-to-earnings ratio  of
9.5 times, compared with  12.6 times  for the benchmark gauge and
 13.3 times  for Etisalat.  “The price-to-earnings ratio of the company is within
average and the royalty burden will only take its toll beginning
2015, where it effectively becomes higher than the previous
one,” Touqan said.  Four  analysts  recommend investors buy the shares, while
five have a hold rating on the stock and one says sell, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Shares of Etisalat slipped 0.2
percent to 9.82 dirhams in Abu Dhabi yesterday, trimming the
gain this year to 8.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
