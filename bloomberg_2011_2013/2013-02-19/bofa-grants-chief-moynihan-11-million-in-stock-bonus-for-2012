Bank of America Corp.  boosted Chief
Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan ’s 2012 compensation by more
than 70 percent to about $12 million and agreed to increase his
base salary for this year.  Moynihan received $11.1 million in stock grants for 2012,
almost doubling the amount he got the previous year, according
to a regulatory  filing  yesterday. For 2013, the bank increased
his base salary to $1.5 million, compared with $950,000 for each
of the previous three years, according to a person briefed on
the matter. The person asked for anonymity because the full
value of the pay package hasn’t been made public yet.  Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets,
rose 109 percent last year in New York  trading , the first annual
gain of Moynihan’s three-year tenure, as capital levels improved
and the firm settled mortgage disputes. Moynihan, 53, has sold
more than $60 billion in assets to boost capital and targeted $8
billion in annual expense savings by 2015 at the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based firm.  “His compensation is a product of what the market and
board perceives to be his leadership,” said  Gustavo Dolfino , a
former UBS AG banker and now president of Whiterock Group LLC, a
New York-based executive-search firm. “This kind of a raise is
indicative of the board supporting what he’s doing.”  Other bank CEOs didn’t fare as well as Moynihan, whose
stock was the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon had his 2012 pay
cut in half to $11.5 million after an internal review concluded
that he bore responsibility for the $6.2 billion “London
Whale” trading loss. Dimon’s $1.5 million salary was left
unchanged while his bonus fell to $10 million in restricted
shares, the New York-based bank said in January.  Morgan Stanley  Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman saw his compensation drop
7.1 percent to $9.75 million. The New York-based firm almost
doubled his salary to $1.5 million and said Gorman’s long-term
incentives will be worth more if performance targets are met.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein’s bonus
surged 90 percent to about $19 million, including $13.3 million
in restricted stock and $5.7 million in cash, a person with
knowledge of the matter said in January. He also receives a $2
million salary.  Bank of America posted net income of $4.2 billion in 2012,
compared to $1.4 billion in 2011. Revenue at Bank of America
will rise faster than at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan over the next
three years as the bank lowers its borrowing costs, Richard
Staite, an analyst with Atlantic Equities LLP, said last week in
a research note.  Co-chief operating officer  Thomas Montag , who runs
investment banking and trading, was awarded $8.3 million in
equity awards, according to a filing.  David Darnell , the other
COO who manages retail banking and wealth management, got awards
of $5.2 million. Chief Financial Officer  Bruce Thompson  got
stock units pegged at $6.1 million.  While Moynihan’s bonus didn’t include a cash component this
year, compensation for other executives may include it, said the
person. The value of the equity awards is tied to the lender’s
$12.03 stock price on Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
