Millennial Media Inc. , a seller of
advertising space on mobile devices, saw its biggest stock
decline since the company’s initial public offering last year
after its sales forecast missed analysts’ estimates.  The shares plunged 38 percent to $8.95 at the close in New
York. Before today’s drop, the stock had gained 14 percent this
year.  Millennial Media, based in Baltimore, projected 2013 sales
of $270 million to $280 million. That missed the $288.75 million
predicted by analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The company’s $58 million in fourth-quarter revenue also fell
short of estimates.  The forecast raised concern that Millennial Media isn’t
capitalizing as much as expected on booming use of mobile
devices. Chief Executive Officer  Paul Palmieri  blamed the
shortfall in part on choosing not to chase smaller customers
last quarter. Meanwhile, some larger deals that were expected to
come through did not, he said.  “It wasn’t really until very late in the quarter that we
saw the effect of our choice not to participate in these low-end
segments,” he said in an interview.  The company, which held its initial public offering in
2012, competes with Google Inc. and Apple Inc. in helping
website owners and application developers sell mobile
advertising.  Millennial Media said yesterday that it’s now reaching more
than 400 million people a month, including about 160 million in
the U.S. Its system works with more than 39,000 applications to
show ads to mobile users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
