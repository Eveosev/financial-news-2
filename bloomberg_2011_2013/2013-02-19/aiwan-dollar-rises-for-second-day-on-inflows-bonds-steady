Taiwan’s dollar strengthened for a
second day after overseas investors boosted holdings of the
island’s shares on optimism economic growth is gaining momentum.
Government bonds were little changed.  Global funds bought $193 million more local stocks than
they sold in the past two days, taking net purchases this year
to $1.8 billion, according to exchange data. The island’s
economy expanded 3.4 percent last quarter from a year earlier,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before
finalized official data due Feb. 22. Gross domestic product
increased 0.98 percent in the preceding three months.  The Taiwan dollar advanced 0.1 percent to NT$29.686 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to prices from Taipei Forex Inc.
It touched NT$29.752 yesterday, the weakest level in more than
five months, after the Group of 20 nations refrained from
censuring Japanese policies driving the yen’s decline.  “The economy is improving after a pretty bad year in
2012,” said  Tarsicio Tong , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange
trader at Union Bank of Taiwan. “The outlook for the local
dollar is highly dependent on how much weaker the yen will go.”  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 10 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due March 2023 was
little changed at 1.207 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.385
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
