Gasoline futures fell for the first
time in three days, sliding from the highest level in more than
four months.  March futures declined 0.7 percent. The discount to April
rose to 18.73 cents after dropping Feb. 15 to 17.93 cents, the
smallest gap in eight days, an indication traders considered
March winter-grade fuel undervalued. April represents summer-
grade gasoline, more costly to refine and blend. Prices rose 2.5
percent last week on concern that refinery closures and seasonal
maintenance would tighten supply.  “The gasoline rally been overdone as refiners operate at
higher rates than historically and gasoline stocks are adequate
given the heavy turnaround schedule,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “Over the
next two to three weeks, refiners will return from their
maintenance and improve the supply situation.”  March gasoline declined 2.11 cents to $3.1134 a gallon at
9:52 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange on volume that was
51 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  The motor fuel has been the top performer this year on the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI  index  of 24 commodities with an 11
percent gain.  Heating oil for March delivery fell 2.72 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.1832 a gallon, the lowest level in two weeks, on
volume that was 18 percent above the 100-day average. Prices
sank 0.9 percent last week, the first drop in five weeks.  “Heating oil stocks, while lower than last year, are
adequate and we’re two-thirds of the way through the heating oil
season,” Lipow said.  The  retail  price for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 1.8 cents to $3.748 a gallon, the highest level since Oct.
16, AAA said today on its website. Prices have risen every day
since Jan. 17, advancing 45.6 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
