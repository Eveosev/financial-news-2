Thailand’s baht halted a three-day
decline and government bonds rose for a second day amid optimism
an improving local economy and relatively higher yields than
developed nations will spur more fund inflows.  The economy grew 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter, after
expanding a revised 3.1 percent in the previous three months,
official data showed yesterday. Global funds bought $1.4 billion
more sovereign debt than they sold this month through yesterday,
Thai Bond Market Association data show. The central bank, which
reviews monetary policy tomorrow, should cut its benchmark rate
to help curb inflows, Arkhom Termpittayapaisith, head of the
National Economic & Social Development Board, said yesterday.  “Thailand’s economy seems to be quite strong and that may
attract more inflows,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at
Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “The baht may
stay in a narrow range near the current level as there is some
concern about the intervention.”  The baht traded at 29.88 per dollar as of 3:19 p.m. in
Bangkok, compared with 29.89 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 29.94 yesterday, the weakest
level since Feb. 11. The currency has strengthened 2.3 percent
this year.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, dropped eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.25 percent.  The Bank of Thailand will keep its benchmark interest rate
at 2.75 percent, according to 16 of 19 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The remaining three predict a quarter of a percentage
point reduction. The rate compares with a maximum of 0.25
percent in the U.S. and 0.1 percent in Japan.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 declined one basis point to 3.62 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
