The rand weakened for a third day
after clashes between labor unions at an  Anglo American Platinum
Ltd.  mine spurred concern of a repeat of violence that curbed
production last year.  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy depreciated as
much as 0.6 percent to 8.9471 per dollar, before trading at
8.9087 at 3:30 p.m. in Johannesburg. Yields on benchmark 10.5
percent bonds due December 2026 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 7.28 percent.  Twelve workers were shot with rubber bullets and three
security guards were hurt in fighting at Amplats’s Siphumelele
mine near Rustenburg yesterday. Machetes and other sharp objects
were used in the attacks, according to police. Amplats workers
will return tomorrow after experiencing a “widespread”
stayaway from the mine, Mpumi Sithole, a company spokeswoman,
said in an e-mailed reply to questions today.  “Labor unrest will most likely remain a feature of the
economic landscape in the foreseeable future,”  John Cairns , a
currency strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said
in e-mailed comments. “This should continue to weigh on the
outlook for the exchange rate.”  Strikes in the mining industry and the shooting of about 34
protesters by police at Lonmin Plc’s Marikana platinum mine last
year shut gold and platinum mines, reducing South Africa’s gross
domestic product by 0.5 percentage point, according to the
National Treasury, and contributed to lowering the nation’s
credit rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
