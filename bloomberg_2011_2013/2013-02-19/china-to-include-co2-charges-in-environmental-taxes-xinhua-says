China, the biggest carbon emissions
producer, will include taxes on the greenhouse gas as part of
environmental protection charges, the Xinhua News Agency said.  Environmental protection taxes will replace current charges
on pollution and be collected by local authorities, Xinhua said
today, citing Jia Chen, head of the Ministry of Finance tax
department. The rates and timeline werenâ€™t disclosed. China may
also expand its resources tax to include water, Xinhua reported.  The government earlier planned to exclude carbon emissions
from its changes to tax on pollution, the Economic Information
Daily said Aug. 22, citing an unidentified government official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
