PGE SA , Poland’s largest power
producer, and domestic peer Energa SA agreed to buy wind assets
in the country from Dong Energy A/S for 1 billion zloty ($320
million) as they replace aging coal plants with cleaner energy.  PGE will acquire 60.5 megawatts of operating assets and 555
megawatts under development, the Warsaw-based company said today
in a statement. Energa will get a 51-megawatt wind farm and 220
megawatts of planned facilities, according to the filing.  PGE is seeking to replace aging power stations and add non-
coal plants to meet European Union rules. The company said last
May that wind energy will account for most of its spending on
new generation as it raises wind capacity more than sevenfold in
four years. For Dong, the divestment of onshore projects will
help it finance an offshore wind expansion while cutting costs.  Dong, Denmark’s biggest utility, expects the deal to result
in a net gain before tax of as much as 600 million kroner ($108
million), which won’t affect earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, it said.  The Danish utility, based in Fredericia, plans to sell 10
billion kroner of assets this year and next to support its
offshore wind plans and has about 5 gigawatts of sea-based wind
projects in various stages of development.  Morgan Stanley advised Energa and Banco Santander SA’s Bank
Zachodni advised PGE. The 40 staff employed by Dong at its
Polish wind unit will transfer to PGE and Energa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
