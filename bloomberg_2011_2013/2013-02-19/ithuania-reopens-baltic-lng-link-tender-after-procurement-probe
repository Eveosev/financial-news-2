  Klaipedos Nafta AB , Lithuania’s
state-controlled energy terminal operator, reopened bidding for
a contract to link a natural-gas terminal to the country’s grid
after complaints about a previous change of the tender terms.  A Lithuanian group whose previous winning bid to build the
20-kilometer (21.8-mile) pipeline was annulled, and Germany’s
PPS Pipeline Systems, which protested the rejection of its
offer, have been invited to present new offers within two weeks,
Klaipedos Nafta AB Chief Executive Officer  Rokas Masiulis  said
today by phone from the town of Klaipeda.  “We’re repeating the last step at initial tender terms, as
instructed by procurement authorities, in order to ensure total
fairness and transparency,” Masiulis said. The delay
“shouldn’t impact” Lithuania’s plans to start operating a new
LNG terminal by the end of 2014, he said.  Lithuania is building a floating liquefied natural-gas
terminal on the Baltic Sea coast to diversify its gas imports
and reduce reliance on Russia’s OAO Gazprom. PPS objected that
terms of the tender to build the pipeline by Oct. 1, 2014, were
changed before the Dec. 20 deadline, eliminating bonus points
for bidders that committed to complete the work earlier.  The Lithuanian bidder, a group including Kauno Dujotiekio
Statyba AB and Siauliu Dujotiekio Statyba UAB, in December
offered to do the work for 138 million litai ($53 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
