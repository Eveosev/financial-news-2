The Philippinesâ€™ Metropolitan
Waterworks and Sewerage System is planning 100 billion pesos
($2.46 billion) of projects this year, the Philippine Daily

as an alternative water source to Angat Dam, which supplies
metropolitan Manila with 97 percent of its water, and a bulk
water project in 22 districts to supply the province of Bulacan,
