Terumo Corp. , Asia’s biggest maker
of medical devices, plans to end a urology partnership with
 Boston Scientific Corp.  in the U.S. and create its own sales,
marketing and distribution unit for the products in April.  Creating the urology unit will provide better access to a
U.S. market estimated to generate $2.3 billion in sales by 2016,
the Tokyo-based company said in a statement today. The Terumo
Interventional Systems unit sells devices including guidewires
and catheters that give doctors access to the heart and
peripheral blood vessels to treat disease.  Terumo ended a similar relationship with Natick,
Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific for heart devices in 2006.
Terumo’s Glidewire products are used in one-third of minimally
invasive urological procedures each year in the U.S., such as
the treatment of kidney stones. About 685,000 Americans annually
are treated for  kidney stones , the accumulation of hard and
painful crystals inside the kidneys.  “We are committed to meeting the growing demands of this
important customer base,” said James Rushworth, president of
Terumo Interventional Systems and the Onset Medical unit that
the company purchased in January 2012 for its sheath technology.
“Terumo Interventional Systems plans to introduce a steady
stream of devices inspired by clinical performance, economic
advantages, and improved quality of life for patients.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
