Nokia Siemens Networks named  Samih Elhage  chief financial officer as parents  Nokia Oyj  and Siemens
AG consider options for the phone-equipment venture’s future.  Elhage, previously chief operating officer, replaces  Marco Schroeter , who is leaving Nokia Siemens immediately, according
to a statement from the Espoo, Finland-based venture today. No
reason was given for the departure.  Siemens and Nokia have intensified talks for the German
partner to exit the six-year-old venture, with options including
a stake sale and initial public offering, people familiar with
the situation said this month. Elhage has helped to reduce costs
at Nokia Siemens and advised private-equity and consulting firms
before joining the venture.  “Samih has made significant contributions in his role as
chief operating officer and is well prepared to step into the
role of CFO,” said Chief Executive Officer  Rajeev Suri  in the
statement. “He has deep commercial skills and a strong command
of company financials.”  Elhage, who has more than 23 years of telecommunications
experience in both financial and operational roles, joined Nokia
Siemens in March.  Nokia and Siemens abandoned talks with private-equity
buyers in 2011 over a sale of the business as the buyout firms
failed to come up with a compelling offer. Nokia Siemens has
since returned to profit, helped by a plan to cut 17,000 jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
