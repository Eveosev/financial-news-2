The European Union’s plan to tackle
a glut of emission permits is on track to be voted by the full
EU Parliament in mid-April, Matthias Groote, the lawmaker in
charge of the draft measure, said after it won approval by a
panel he chairs.   “My role is to build a majority for the proposal,”
Groote, head of the European Parliament’s environment committee,
said in an interview today in Brussels. “There is no
alternative to the EU emissions-trading system and more and more
colleagues realize that.” His committee supported a compromise
version of the carbon-fix plan.  Groote, a German Socialist, said he will continue
discussions with different political groups in the 754-seat
assembly after the environment panel postponed for about a week
a separate decision on whether to give him a mandate to start
negotiations with EU national governments on a carbon-fix
agreement. Groote declined to speculate about whether he would
win the mandate, which would allow for a fast-track EU accord by
limiting the number of times the full Parliament would have to
be consulted.    The original plan proposed by the European Commission, the
27-nation EU’s regulatory arm, to delay sales of some carbon
permits has divided Parliament members, national governments and
the industry.   “I want to bring all colleagues on board,” Groote said.
“It is not a hot potato, it’s a democratic question and I want
to bring it to success.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
