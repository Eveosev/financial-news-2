The dollar is likely to trade at
about 90 yen in the coming weeks before resuming its climb
toward 99.74, Forecast Pte said, citing trading patterns. That
would be the highest level since May 2009.  The dollar is looking “overbought” based on its 14-day
relative strength index versus the yen, according to  Pak Lai Ng ,
a　Singapore-based technical analyst at Forecast. The RSI was at
65 today, near the 70 level some analysts see as a sign the
asset’s price may reverse direction after rising too rapidly.
“The longer-term trend is still up for dollar-yen, but it has
to correct some of the up move first,” he said.  The dollar slid 0.1 percent to 93.90 yen as of 11:12 a.m.
in Tokyo from yesterday. It has strengthened 15 percent versus
the Japanese currency in the past three months and touched 94.46
yen on Feb. 11, the highest since May 2010. The last time the
greenback traded at 99.74 was on May 7, 2009.  Should the U.S. currency rise above the recent high of
94.46 yen, it will probably climb toward 99.74, the 50 percent
retracement from its drop from the June 2007 high of 124.14 to
the post World War II record low of 75.35 reached in October
2011 on the Fibonacci chart, Ng said.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a new high or a low.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an area on a
chart where analysts anticipate orders to buy may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
