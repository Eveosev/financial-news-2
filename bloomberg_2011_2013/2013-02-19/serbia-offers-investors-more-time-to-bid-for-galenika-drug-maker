Serbia gave potential investors two
more weeks to make offers for Galenika AD, an unprofitable
drugmaker, as the government seeks to turn around money-losing
state enterprises.  International pharmaceutical companies will have until
April 1, instead of an original March 18 deadline, to submit
letters of intent, according to the announcement the Belgrade-
based  Finance Ministry  posted on its website.  Serbia invited companies active in the pharmaceuticals
industry over the past five years and with operating revenue of
more than 200 million euros ($267 million) in 2011, on Jan. 15
to submit their own proposals for a “privatization model” for
Galenika.  To contact the reporter on this story:
