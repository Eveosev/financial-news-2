For all its social-media and
communications skills, the Obama White House remains politically
tone deaf.  This impairment was on display last weekend, when President
 Barack Obama  played a  round of golf  with  Tiger Woods  and big
campaign contributors at a posh Florida resort, with the
 draconian budget cuts  under the sequester slated to take effect
in less than two weeks. The press corps was shut out, and the
White House even made sure Woods wouldn’t be seen leaving the
club.  Understandably, this didn’t play well. Yet there was a
simple way to avoid all the bad feeling: Asking Republican  Jeb Bush  to join the golf round. Obama and the former Florida
governor could have discussed their shared agendas on
immigration and education. But this White House doesn’t like to
reach out to Republicans, especially during what Obama regards
as his private time.  ( Albert R. Hunt  is a Bloomberg View columnist. Follow him
