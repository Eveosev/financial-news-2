The upper limit for Brent crude will
rise from $140 a barrel this year to $175 in 2017 because of
constraints on supply, Bank of America Corp. estimates.  Brent, trading near $117 a barrel in London today, will
remain in a price range of $100 to $130 through 2015, supported
by rising production costs, increasing budgetary needs in OPEC
nations, and stimulus measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the
bank said in an e-mailed report. Brent won’t fall to less than
$80 a barrel until 2017 because any plunge in prices would boost
demand, it said.  “Significant non-OPEC supply constraints outside North
America and expanding OPEC budgets will likely create a firm
floor on Brent,”  Francisco Blanch , the bank’s New York-based
head of commodities research, wrote in the report published
yesterday.  Development of the non-conventional oil supplies on which
the world increasingly relies, such as oil sands and shale oil,
requires that prices remain at $80 a barrel or higher so as to
attract investment, Bank of America said. At the same time,
domestic spending by many nations in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries mean that these governments
require a price of no less than $80 to $90, the bank said.  While Brent prices will remain supported in the next few
years, Bank of America reiterated its forecast that U.S.
benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude may slip to $50 within
the next two years amid booming North American supply. The bank
expects 3.9 million barrels a day in supply growth from 2012 to
2017 to come from non-OPEC producers, 80 percent of it from the
U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
