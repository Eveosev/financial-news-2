Turkey’s central bank reduced
overnight interest rates and raised reserve requirements in an
effort to rein in the lira’s appreciation while curbing loan
growth. The currency and bond yields sank.  The Ankara-based  bank  cut the overnight borrowing rate to
4.5 percent from 4.75 percent and the overnight lending rate to
8.5 percent from 8.75 percent. It left the benchmark one-week 
repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent and also raised foreign-
exchange reserve requirements to 11.5 percent from 11.1 percent,
withdrawing $940 million from the market.  “This seems to be the new policy mix of choice on the part
of the central bank, still favoring a dovish bias on the rates
front, just to make sure that the lira doesn’t strengthen too
much, but also keeping a close eye on credit developments,”
 Benoit Anne , head of global emerging markets strategy at  Societe
Generale SA  in London, said in e-mailed comments.  The lira fell 0.7 percent to 1.7791 against the dollar at
2:53 p.m. in Istanbul, its weakest intraday level since Jan. 9.
Yields on two-year benchmark bonds dropped 10 basis points, or
0.1 percentage point, to 5.66 percent, a basis point off its
record low.  Discourage Growth  Turkey’s central bank cut the one-week benchmark repo rate
to 5.5 percent in December in the first cut to the rate since
August 2011 as economic growth fell to about 2.5 percent last
year from 8.5 percent in 2011. The unemployment rate rose to 9.4
percent in November from 9.1 percent in October, the statistics
office data showed on Feb. 15.  Loans grew 19.1 percent in the 12 months to Feb. 8,
according to data published by the banking regulator on Feb. 18,
exceeding the central bank’s 15 percent ceiling for loan growth.  “Reserve requirement ratio hikes are designed to
discourage credit growth,” said  Manik Narain , an emerging
market strategist at UBS AG in London, while “downward shifts
to the overnight rates corridor are designed to ward off
speculative short-term inflows.”  The Real Effective Exchange Rate for the lira rose to
120.16 in January, exceeding a level signaling the lira is
overvalued for the central bank. A “measured rate cut to the
interest rate corridor or policy rate is possible if the real
effective exchange rate appreciates excessively,” Governor
 Erdem Basci  said Jan. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
