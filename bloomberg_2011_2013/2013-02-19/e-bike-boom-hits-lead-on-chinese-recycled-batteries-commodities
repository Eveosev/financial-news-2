Recycled battery lead from electric
bicycles is leaving China, the world’s biggest consumer and
producer of the metal, with the largest glut in six years.  Supply will outpace demand this year as consumers trade in
old e-bikes for new ones that use less lead, even after the
market expanded 5 percent in 2012, according to Wood Mackenzie
Ltd. Recycled metal from cars and e-bikes represented 35 percent
of supply in 2011, up from 21 percent a decade earlier, the
International Lead and Zinc Study Group said. Battery junk from
e-bikes, which use about 11 kilograms (24 pounds) of lead, will
more than triple to 190,000 metric tons this year from 2010,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates.  While lead rose 19 percent on the London Metal Exchange
since October, it gained just 1.1 percent on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange as  inventory  more than tripled. Supply in
China, including mined output, will exceed demand by 206,000
tons this year, the most since 2007 and enough to satisfy the
nation’s factories for 15 days, according to Credit Suisse Group
AG.  “We expect quite a sharp pick-up in scrap availability in
China,” said  David Wilson , a metals analyst at Citigroup Inc.
in London. “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to think
that a lot of car batteries that were initially new in 2009 will
be replaced in 2013 and onwards. Batteries used in e-bikes have
an even shorter life.”  LME Index  Lead prices have climbed 1.9 percent this year to $2,375 a
ton on the LME, compared with gains of 1.7 percent for the  LME
index  of six industrial metals and 5.3 percent for the MSCI
World Index of shares. Treasuries have declined 0.9 percent,
according to a Bank of America index.  Chinese rode more than 180 million e-bikes by the end of
last year, up 36 percent since 2010, Wood Mackenzie, the
Edinburgh-based researcher, estimates. Pedaled bikes powered by
motors and scooters using  electricity  are a cheaper option to
cars in a country where the capital city, Beijing, is congested
with record pollution. Output of e-bikes, which can be speedier
on crowded streets and don’t require a license to drive, rose an
average 10 percent a year from 2008 to 2010, according to Wood Mackenzie.  In China, which became the largest  car market  in 2009,
there are about 80 vehicles for every 1,000 people compared with
600 in Japan and 800 in the U.S., according to Macquarie Group
Ltd. China’s passenger vehicle sales surged 49 percent to 1.73
million units in January, a monthly record, the state-backed
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said in an e-mail
on Feb. 7.  More Cars  “Yes, there will be more scrap batteries coming back
because there are more cars and there are more e-bikes on the
road,” said  Duncan Hobbs , a metals analyst at Macquarie in
London. “But people want even more cars and even more e-
bikes.”  Demand for lead will climb 7.5 percent this year to 4.994
million tons, according to Credit Suisse. China’s economic
expansion accelerated for the first time in two years in the
fourth quarter and will reach 8.1 percent in 2013, up from 7.8
percent last year, according to the median of 47 economist
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Some new e-bikes contain less lead as the industry cuts
back on costs, according to Beijing Antaike Information &
Technology Co. Average lead content has dropped from 13
kilograms in 2010, according to Wood Mackenzie. A standard car
battery has 9 kilograms to 10 kilograms of lead, according to
the International Lead Association, a London-based association
that has 36 members.  Fivefold Gain  China helped send prices up more than fivefold in the past
decade. The e-bike market accounts for 39 percent of the
country’s lead consumption, compared with 22 percent for cars
and trucks, estimates from Deutsche Bank AG show.  Newly mined lead met most of the demand for new e-bikes
between 2004 and 2010,  Max Layton , an analyst in London at
Goldman Sachs, and  Roger Yuan , the bank’s analyst in Hong Kong,
wrote in a Feb. 5 report. Since then, a growing supply of old e-
bikes has reduced the need for new metal, they said. The trend
“illustrates the easing of demand pressure in the Chinese lead
market since 2010.”  Goldman forecasts lead prices will drop to $2,150 a ton in
three months.  Lead Premium  Citigroup recommends investors sell lead and buy zinc, and
forecasts the $227.75 price  difference  between the two will
disappear in the next three to six months. Both metals are
extracted from the same mines. Lead’s premium over zinc will
average $152 a ton in the second quarter compared with $270 this
quarter, according to the median of 10 analyst forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg.  Globally, refined lead output will grow 5.7 percent this
year to 11.4 million tons, and match consumption, which will
expand 6 percent, Barclays Plc estimates. China accounts for
about 46 percent of worldwide output, the London-based bank said
in a report e-mailed on Feb. 15.  Refined lead output in China from recycled material
exceeded 2.5 million tons last year, more than double the total
five years earlier, according to CHR Metals Ltd., a lead and
zinc consulting company in Godalming, England.  “A feature of the market now is the increasing share of
sales going to replace older models rather than to first-time
buyers,” said  Huw Roberts , co-founder of CHR Metals. “This
means that the rate of growth of the e-bike fleet is slowing
which, in turn, means that recycled lead from e-bike batteries
will increasingly represent a larger share of the overall demand
for lead from this sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
