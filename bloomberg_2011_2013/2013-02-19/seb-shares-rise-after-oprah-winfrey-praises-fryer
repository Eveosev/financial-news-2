Groupe SEB shares rose the most in
six months today in Paris after U.S. chat show host  Oprah Winfrey  praised one of the French company’s electric fryers.  The company’s T-FAL ActiFry, which fries food using just 1
tablespoon of oil, “has changed my life,” Oprah wrote in a
Twitter post on Feb. 15, adding “And they’re not paying me to
say it.”  The Le Parisien newspaper reported her endorsement today.  SEB shares rose as much as 5.2 percent in early trading,
their biggest increase since July 19, 2012. They traded up 3.1
percent at 61.82 euros as of 11:41 a.m. in Paris.  More than 82,000 shares changed hands in the first 2 ½ hours
of trading, exceeding the average daily volume in the last three
months of 79,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
