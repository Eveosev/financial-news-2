Offshore crudes produced in the Gulf
of Mexico strengthened against U.S. benchmark  West Texas
Intermediate  after the Seaway pipeline’s operator said the line
will operate below capacity “in the foreseeable future.”  The  Seaway  line carried 180,000 barrels a day after an
expansion in January that was supposed to boost the flow from
storage in Cushing, Oklahoma, to refineries on the Texas coast
to 400,000 barrels a day, according to Feb. 15 testimony from
Enterprise Products Partners LP to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.  Southern Green Canyon , an offshore grade delivered to
Nederland, Texas, gained 60 cents to trade at a $15 premium to
WTI as of 2:22 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Bonito Sour and Eugene Island grades, delivered to
ports in Louisiana, gained $1.25 and $1, respectively, to trade
at premiums of $19 and $19.25 to WTI.  A diminished flow rate on Seaway strengthens the price of
offshore oils relative to WTI, since the pipeline moves
competing mid-continent oils to coastal refiners.  Flows at Seaway’s final terminal at Jones Creek, Texas,
were cut to 175,000 barrels a day shortly after the expansion
was opened in January because of capacity constraints there.  Other offshore Gulf grades also strengthened against WTI.
 Light Louisiana Sweet  rose 35 cents to a $21.80 premium. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet gained 15 cents to a premium of $21.70.  Thunder Horse , a medium sweet crude delivered to Louisiana,
weakened by $1 a barrel to a $19.25 premium to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
