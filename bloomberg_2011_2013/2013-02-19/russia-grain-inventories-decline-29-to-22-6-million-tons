 Grain stockpiles in Russia, last
season’s third-biggest  wheat exporter , fell about 29 percent
from a year earlier as of Feb. 1, government statistics showed.  Inventories were 22.6 million metric tons, compared with 32
million tons a year earlier, the Moscow-based Federal State
Statistics Service said today in an e-mailed statement. Leading
agricultural producers held stockpiles of 11.7 million tons,
while procurement and milling companies had 10.9 million tons,
compared with respective year-earlier levels of 17 million tons
and 15 million tons.  Procurement firms and millers had about 7.1 million tons of
stockpiled wheat, of which 5.7 million tons was of milling
quality, said Rosstat, as the service is known. That was down
from about 11 million tons a year earlier, including about 8.9
million tons of milling wheat.  Inventories fell 7.7 percent from a year earlier to about
5.9 million tons in the Central Federal District and slid almost
35 percent to about 5.6 million tons in the Volga Federal
District. Stockpiles dropped 37 percent to about 3.2 million
tons in the Southern Federal District and plunged 45 percent to
1.1 million tons in the North Caucasus Federal District, which
are the closest to Russia’s main export routes.  Rosstat’s figures exclude small private farms and household
reserves, which accounted for 22 percent of Russia’s grain crop
this season, according to Agriculture Ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
