Spanish  exports  surged to a record
last year, narrowing the trade deficit to the least since 1998
even as the country’s  recession  worsened.  Exports totaled 222.6 billion euros ($297 billion), up from
215.2 billion euros in 2011, the Economy Ministry said in a
statement handed out to reporters in Madrid. That’s the most
since 1971. The nation’s  trade deficit  narrowed 34 percent to
30.8 billion euros in 2012, as imports fell 2.8 percent. In
December, exports gained 4.6 percent from a year earlier.  “This has been made possible thanks to improvements in
competitiveness,” Deputy Minister for Trade  Jaime Garcia-Legaz 
Ponce said. “In addition to the exchange rate, the efforts made
to conquer new markets have been important.”  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , in power since December 2011,
is counting on exports to fuel an economic recovery as early as
this year and enable Spain to avoid a full bailout. Measures
such as labor-law changes to help companies cut costs are
boosting investor confidence, he said last week.  Garcia-Legaz said he is confident exports will continue to
increase this year. In 2011, Spanish foreign sales rose 15.2
percent from 2010.  Economy Minister  Luis de Guindos  expects data due Feb. 28
to show that Spain’s current account was nearly balanced in
2012. The nation, which ran the world’s second-biggest deficit
during its debt-fueled housing boom that ended in 2008, posted
its fourth monthly  surplus  since the start of the euro in
December.  Spanish sovereign bonds have rallied since the European
Central Bank pledged to do whatever is needed to defend the
single currency in July, boosting foreign portfolio investment
and holdings of government debt. Even so, the yield on Spain’s
 10-year benchmark bond  has risen about 40 basis points since a
10-month low of 4.84 percent on Jan. 11 amid uncertainty about
the country’s public finances and economic outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
