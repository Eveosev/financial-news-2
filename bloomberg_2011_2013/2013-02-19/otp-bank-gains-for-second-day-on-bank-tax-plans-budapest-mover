OTP Bank Nyrt. , Hungary’s largest
lender, rose to the highest in more than 18 months after the
government said it was preparing a “significant” reduction in
bank levies.  The shares advanced 0.9 percent to close at 4,920 forint in
Budapest, the highest level since August 2011. The benchmark BUX
stock  index , in which OTP has the highest weighting at 34
percent, gained 0.8 percent.  The government would give the tax break in exchange for
commercial banks boosting loan provision, ruling party vice
president Lajos Kosa said in a TV2 interview today. The
government is in “informal” talks with commercial banks on a
deal that would give cuts as incentives for helping the economy
emerge from recession, Gyula Pleschinger, state secretary at the
Economy Ministry, said on MR1-Kossuth public radio over the
weekend.  “OTP may be the biggest beneficiary of the government
plan,”  Gergely Gabler , a Budapest-based analyst at broker
Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in a research report today.  The government has introduced a special levy on lenders,
taxed financial transactions such as cash withdrawals and forced
banks to take losses on foreign-currency loans since coming to
power in 2010.  While the news on the tax breaks is favorable, banks can
already make some deductions under “very strict” conditions,
Erste Group Bank AG said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
