U.S. nuclear-power production rose
as  Progress Energy Inc.  returned the Robinson 2 reactor in South
Carolina to full power.  Nationwide generation  increased 0.2 percent to 85,570
megawatts, or 84 percent of capacity, according to U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 4.5
percent lower than  a year ago , with 16 of 104 reactors offline.  The 710-megawatt Robinson 2 operated at full capacity early
today, up from 52 percent yesterday. The plant is about 26 miles
(42 kilometers) northwest of Florence, South Carolina.  Output in the Midwest climbed as the 512-megawatt Point
Beach 1 operated by  NextEra Energy Inc.  returned to full power
from 98 percent of capacity yesterday. The reactor is 13 miles
northwest of Manitoc, Wisconsin.  FirstEnergy Corp. ’s 1,261-megawatt Perry 1 plant, 35 miles
northeast of Cleveland, rose to 97 percent of capacity from 96
percent yesterday.  Production was lower than year-earlier levels in three of
the NRC regions, all except the Northeast. In the West,  output 
was 10.7 percent lower than a year ago, with seven closed
reactors. Three have shut for refueling since Feb. 1, pushing
production down 16 percent so far this month.  Refueling Shutdowns  River Bend 1 , a 989-megawatt  Entergy Corp.  reactor, was
halted Feb. 16 for refueling and maintenance, Katie Damratoski,
a company spokeswoman based in St. Francisville, Louisiana, said
in an e-mail today. The plant is about 24 miles northwest of
Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  In the Midwest, Entergy’s 778-megawatt Palisades 1 reactor,
5 miles south of South Haven, Michigan, shut Feb. 15 for repairs
on the cooling water heat exchanger system and the main
generator disconnect switch, Mark Savage, a company spokesman
based in Covert, Michigan, said in an e-mail.  In the Northeast,  Constellation Energy Group Inc.  closed
Calvert Cliffs 2 for planned refueling and maintenance Feb. 17,
Kory Raftery, a spokesman based at the plant, said in an e-mail.
 The unit  produces as much as 862 megawatts 40 miles south of
Annapolis, Maryland. Calvert Cliffs 1 operated at 100 percent of
capacity today.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 46 days in
2012, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
