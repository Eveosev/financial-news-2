Illinois Tool Works Inc.  is studying
options including a sale or spinoff of its industrial packaging
unit, which had revenue of about $2.4 billion last year, under a
plan to boost profit by divesting commodity-tied businesses.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have been
hired to assist in the review, which is expected to continue
through this year, the Glenview, Illinois-based company said
today in a statement. The unit makes steel, plastic and paper
packaging used in transporting goods.  Illinois Tool, which had revenue of $17.9 billion in 2012,
devised a strategy to sell less profitable businesses and
consolidate units after  Ralph Whitworth ’s Relational Investors
LLC took a stake last year and pushed for increased profit.
Illinois Tool in October completed the $1.1 billion sale of a
51 percent stake in its decorative-surfaces division.  Relational began talks with management shortly after
disclosing a holding in January 2012 that rose to 3.1 percent
later in the year. The stake has been cut by 2.2 million shares
to 12.3 million shares, or 2.7 percent, according to a Feb. 14
filing.  Illinois Tool rose 1.7 percent to $64.32 at 9:50 a.m. in
New York. The  shares  had gained 4 percent this year through
Feb. 15, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 6.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
