Brazil swap rates rose, erasing
earlier declines, as traders interpreted comments from central
bank President  Alexandre Tombini  as leaving the door open for
interest-rate increases.  “When necessary, if supported by the prospective scenario
for inflation, the posture of the central bank in relation to
monetary policy will be adequately adjusted,” Tombini said at
an event in Brasilia.  Swap rates due January 2015 rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 8.48 percent at 5:15 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, after earlier falling as much as 14 basis points. The
real gained 0.4 percent to 1.9548 per dollar.  Tombini’s comments are a sign that “the central bank may
not raise rates in March, but nothing is guaranteed in the
meeting after that in April,”  Paulo Petrassi , managing partner
at Leme Investimentos, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
