The New York Jets cut linebackers
 Bart Scott  and  Calvin Pace  in a five-player purge to move the
team closer to the National Football League’s salary cap.  The Jets also released offensive lineman  Jason Smith , a No.
2 draft pick, and safety  Eric Smith , and placed tight end Josh
Baker on waivers, the team said in an e-mailed release.  The moves will save the team $24.2 million under the NFL’s
payroll limit and leave them about $2 million above the cap,
according To ESPN.  “Every one of these players was a major contributor to our
football team,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said in the release. “They
have the work ethic and attitude that you look for in players.”  The Jets were 6-10 in 2012 and allowed 375 points, their
highest total since 1996. This offseason, special teams
coordinator  Mike Westhoff  retired, offensive coordinator  Tony Sparano  was fired and defensive coordinator  Mike Pettine  took
the same job with the Buffalo Bills. General Manager  Mike Tannenbaum  also was fired.  Scott, 32, came to New York in 2009 when Ryan, his
defensive coordinator with the Baltimore Ravens, was named
coach. He missed just one game in his four years with the team,
and recorded 342 tackles and 8 1/2 sacks.  Scott also was fined $10,000 for cursing and making an
obscene gesture to photographers following the 2011 season, and
last season declared a media boycott in the locker room. The New
York Daily News said that in September that he threatened a
reporter who tried to take his picture.  Pace, 32, had 28 sacks and forced 11 fumbles in five
seasons with the Jets. He was due to make $11.6 million next
year, ESPN said.  Jason Smith was selected with the second pick in the 2009
NFL draft by the St. Louis Rams. He was traded to the Jets last
year and appeared in all 16 games.  Eric Smith had five interceptions in seven seasons with the
Jets. Baker spent the 2012 season on injured reserve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
