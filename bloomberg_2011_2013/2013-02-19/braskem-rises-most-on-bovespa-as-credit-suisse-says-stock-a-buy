Braskem SA , Latin America’s largest
petrochemicals producer, rose the most on the Bovespa after
Credit Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation to the
equivalent of buy.  Shares gained 6.3 percent to 14.78 reais at 3:29 p.m. in
Sao Paulo after surging as much as 8.3 percent, the biggest
intraday advance since Aug. 3. It was the best performer on the
benchmark  Bovespa index,  which dropped 0.3 percent.  Fourth-quarter earnings and asset sales announced in the
past few months led Credit Suisse’s  Emerson Leite  to raise
Braskem to outperform, which means its shares are expected to
beat the overall market in the next 12 months.  Braskem has “lower risk to consensus downgrades,
reasonable valuation and momentum ahead of itself,” Credit
Suisse’s analysts wrote in a note to clients published
yesterday.  Shares trade at 23.2 times its 2013 forecast earnings,
compared with 11.2 for companies on the Bovespa index, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
