Japan’s Topix Index rose a second
day, reversing earlier declines, as Bridgestone Corp. jumped the
most in four years to lead gains after boosting its outlook.  Bridgestone soared 10 percent after saying profit will rise
37 percent this year. Grandy House Corp. advanced 8.3 percent
after the homebuilder said it will conduct a 3-for-1 stock split
on April 1. JX Holdings Inc. rose 2.8 percent after winning
approval for an oil project in the North Sea. Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, lost 0.9 percent as the yen
strengthened against the dollar.  The  Topix  climbed 0.1 percent to 963.61 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, erasing declines of as much as 0.5 percent.
Twice as many stocks rose as fell on the measure. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average sank 0.3 percent to 11,372.34.  “The weaker yen’s benefit on companies like Bridgestone is
big,” said  Hideyuki Suzuki , a senior market analyst at Tokyo-
based brokerage SBI Securities Co. “Japanese stocks are likely
to gain as investors turn their attention to fundamentals like
corporate earnings and economic data.”  The Topix surged 33 percent since Nov. 14, when national
elections were announced, amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe and the central bank will lead the country out of deflation.
The measure is trading at 1.1 times book value, compared with
2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Brigestone Jumps  Bridgestone soared 10 percent to 2,820 yen, its highest
since May 2006. The tiremaker said net income will jump to 235
billion yen ($2.5 billion) this year, beating the 206 billion
yen average estimates of 15  analysts  compiled by Bloomberg. The
Topix Rubber Products Index rose the most among the gauge’s 33
industry groups.  Grandy House jumped 8.3 percent to 886 yen, its highest
close since August 2007 and among the  biggest gains  on the Topix
Index after announcing a share split.  JX Holdings rose 2.8 percent to 543 yen, the third-biggest
boost to the Topix. The oil producer won approval from the U.K.
for the Mariner oil project in the North Sea.  Exporters limited gains on the Topix after the yen
strengthened against the dollar, cutting the outlook for their
earnings. The yen rose to 93.70 per dollar after weakening to
93.97 earlier after Finance Minister Taro Aso said the
government wasn’t considering changing the central bank law and
will not buy foreign bonds through a public-private fund,
contradiction Abe’s statements the day before.  Toyota lost 0.9 percent to 4,740 yen. Honda Motor Co.,
which gets about 80 percent of its revenue outside of Japan,
fell 0.4 percent to 3,490 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s biggest
camera maker, lost 0.5 percent to 3,295 yen.  Mixed Messages  Abe told parliament yesterday that buying foreign bonds
“exists as one idea” for monetary policy and the BOJ law may
be revised. His election campaign last year proposed a fund to
buy foreign bonds, with the BOJ, the Ministry of Finance and
private companies participating.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said today
that Abe will consider Bank of Japan nominations after his Feb.
22 summit with President Barack Obama in Washington. BOJ
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa is set to step down on March 19.  “There appears to be a rift growing between the Japanese
PM and his finance minister,” said  Gavin Parry , managing
director of Hong Kong-based brokerage Parry International
Trading Ltd. “Stocks rebounded on speculation this may have
been a move to temper the yen’s weakness ahead of the BOJ
appointment. If an Abenomics monk is appointed, we will see
further yen weakness.”  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index slipped 0.7
percent to 27.58, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.9
percent of the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on
the measure was about 28 percent lower than its 30-day intraday
average at the close of trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
