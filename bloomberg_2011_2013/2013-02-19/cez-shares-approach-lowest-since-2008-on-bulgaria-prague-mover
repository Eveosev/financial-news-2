CEZ AS  tumbled to near its lowest in
more than four years after Bulgaria announced it will strip the
Czech utility of its power-distribution license.  The stock dropped as much as 2.2 percent to 602.5 koruna,
matching the lowest intraday level since October 2008 reached on
Jan. 28. It traded down 0.7 percent to 612 koruna by 3:47 p.m.
in Prague, down for a fifth day and set for the longest retreat
since June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  CEZ’s license will be revoked today after an investigation
showed the biggest power producer in central and eastern Europe
by market capitalization violated public-procurement rules,
Prime Minister  Boyko Borissov  told reporters in Sofia today. CEZ
responded in a statement that the government has no grounds to
revoke its license, calling Borissov’s announcement a “gross
violation of legal norms.”  “Should CEZ really be unable to continue its operations in
Bulgaria, this could lower 2013 earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization by about 1 percent to 2 percent,”
 Josef Nemy , an analyst at Komercni Banka AS in Prague, wrote in
an e-mail to Bloomberg. “The impact on this year’s net income
is hard to predict at this moment given the risk that CEZ might
write off some of its Bulgarian assets.”  CEZ derived 9.9 percent of its 2011 revenue from Bulgaria,
making it the company’s second-biggest market after the Czech
Republic, data compiled by Bloomberg show. CEZ shares have
 dropped  10 percent in 2013, compared with a 3.7 percent decline
by the  PX  index, as tumbling electricity prices worsened the
outlook for the utility’s earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
