Exxon Mobil Corp ., the world’s
largest energy company by market value, said new shale projects
in the U.S. and heavy-oil developments in Canada helped swell
crude and natural gas reserves last year.  Exxon added reserves equivalent to 1.8 billion barrels in
2012, raising its year-end total to 25.2 billion, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in statement today. The additions were
enough to replace 115 percent of total output and 174 percent of
its crude and liquids production.  The company returns to having more than half of its
reserves in liquids, instead of gas. At the end of 2012, the
company’s reserves were comprised of 51 percent liquids, such as
crude, and 49 percent gas, according to the statement, a
reversal of 2011’s percentages.  Three-fourths of the new  reserves  resulted from discoveries
and re-evaluations of existing fields in the Woodford shale in
Oklahoma, the Bakken formation in North Dakota, and the Cold
Lake and Hebron developments in Canada, according to the
statement.  Exxon rose 1.1 cents to $89.32 at the close in New York.
The shares have increased 3.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
