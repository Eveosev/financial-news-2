Demand Media Inc. , operator of the
EHow.com website, rose as much as 24 percent in extended trading
after the company announced plans to split its content and
domain-registration businesses into two public companies.  Demand Media jumped as high as $9.75 after closing at $7.84
in regular New York trading. The shares had fallen 16 percent
this year before the breakup was announced in a statement after
today’s close.  The board-approved separation will allow both businesses to
pursue growth strategies and provide greater clarity for
investors, the Santa Monica, California-based company said in
the statement. The company said it’s working with outside
advisers to develop detailed plans for separating the
businesses.  Through EHow.com, Demand Media offers articles and videos
on topics ranging from personal finance to celebrity news. The
content business includes the Cracked.com humor website. The
company also operates the domain-registration service ENom.com.  Separately, the company reported fourth-quarter net income
of $4.7 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$6.4 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 22
percent to $103.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
