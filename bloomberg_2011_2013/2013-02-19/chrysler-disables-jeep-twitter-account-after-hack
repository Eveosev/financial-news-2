Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker controlled by  Fiat SpA , temporarily disabled its
Twitter Inc. account for Jeep after hackers replaced the brand’s
logo with Cadillac’s and posted bogus statements.  The company is working to restore the account after
learning of the development about 1:30 p.m. New York time,
 Eileen Wunderlich , a spokeswoman for Auburn Hills, Michigan-
based Chrysler, said in an interview today. Chrysler doesn’t
know who hacked the account, she said.  “We’re aware of the issue, and we’re working on it now,”
Wunderlich said by telephone.  Jeep’s Twitter issue follows a report by the Associated
Press that  Burger King Worldwide Inc. ’s account was accessed
yesterday by hackers who posted racial epithets and replaced its
logo with that of  McDonald’s Corp.  Twitter, the microblogging
site with more than 200 million active users, said this month it
detected unauthorized attempts to hack into its systems and that
attackers may have obtained access to information for about
250,000 people.  The false Jeep posts included one saying the brand was sold
to Detroit-based  General Motors Co .’s Cadillac. That hasn’t
happened, David Caldwell, a GM spokesman, said in an e-mail.  “This is just Twitter mischief,” Caldwell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
