SK Hynix Inc. , the world’s second-
largest maker of computer memory chips, appointed former Chief
Technology Officer  Park Sung Wook  as its new co-chief executive
officer from this month, replacing  Kwon Oh Chul .  Park, who joined the chipmaker in 1984 and headed the
research & development division, will lead Hynix alongside  Chey Tae Won , the chairman of SK Holdings Co. Kwon, who’s three-year
term expired, will serve as company adviser, the Icheon, South
Korea-based company said in a statement yesterday.  The new appointment comes at a time when global chipmakers
are reeling from falling demand for personal computers. Hynix,
which last month reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter
earnings, is also looking to diversify its business portfolio to
more profitable mobile chips.  “The memory chip market is facing various inflection
points, including an industrywide reshuffle” and preparation of
the next-generation memory chips, Hynix said in the statement.
“In order to rapidly address such technical change in the
future, the industry requires technology leadership.”  Fourth-quarter net income was 163.7 billion won ($151
million), compared with a loss of 239.9 billion won a year
earlier, Hynix reported Jan. 30. Profit  beat  the 120.2 billion-
won average of analyst estimates as increased production of
chips for Apple Inc. iPhones and other mobile devices helped
offset waning demand for DRAM for PCs.  SK Telecom Co. , South Korea’s largest mobile-phone carrier,
 bought  control of the chipmaker in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
