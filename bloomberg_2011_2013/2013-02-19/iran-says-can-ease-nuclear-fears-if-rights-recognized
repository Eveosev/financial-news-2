Iran can ease western states’
concern over its nuclear activities if they fully recognize its
right to operate a civilian nuclear program, Foreign Ministry
spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast  said, days before international
talks in Kazakhstan.  If the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Russia, China
“recognize our full rights for peaceful nuclear energy, this
will show their goodwill,” Mehmanparast said at a press
conference in Tehran today that was aired by Iranian state
television. “As for us, we will offer ways to remove concerns”
that Iran’s nuclear program may have a military dimension.  “Proper measures” can be taken by both sides, though each
step taken needs to be “equal and proportionate,” Mehmanparast
said.  Iran is resuming stalled multilateral negotiations on its
nuclear work with the group known as P5+1 on Feb. 26 in
Kazakhstan. The last round of talks between Iran and world
powers were held in Moscow in June and failed to yield results.
World powers asked the Islamic Republic to suspend production of
20 percent enriched uranium while Iran pressed for relief from
financial and trade sanctions imposed because of its nuclear
program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
