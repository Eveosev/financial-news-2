Carnival Corp.  led a drop in cruise
line bookings in the week through yesterday after the fire
aboard the company’s Triumph ship last week, Barclays Plc said.  Carnival Cruise Line’s business was “considerably weak”
as bookings in general were down from the prior week, based on
information from travel agents,  Felicia Hendrix , a Barclays
analyst who rates the company’s shares equal weight, said in a
report today. Competitors such as  Royal Caribbean International 
didn’t have a similar decline, she said, without giving figures.  Carnival said last week that the Triumph fire, which
stranded 3,100 passengers on the ship with limited food and
bathroom facilities, would cost the Miami-based company 8 cents
to 10 cents a share in the first half. Carnival’s ticket revenue
fell 4 percent last year as it lowered prices after its Costa
Concordia ran aground off the coast of Italy, taking 32 lives.  Vance Gulliksen, a Carnival spokesman, declined to comment
about the Barclays report.  Carnival fell 1.1 percent to $36.51 at the close in New
York. The  shares  have declined less than 1 percent this year, as
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 7.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
