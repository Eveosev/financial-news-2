Yields on Mexico’s benchmark 10-year
bonds held at a one-week low as speculation policy makers will
cut borrowing costs drove demand ahead of an auction today to
sell more of the securities.  Yields on government peso bonds due in 2022 were little
changed at 5.05 percent at 9:23 a.m. in Mexico City. It’s the
lowest yield on a closing basis since Feb. 6. Mexico’s peso
declined 0.1 percent to 12.6969 per U.S. dollar.  Mexico plans to sell as much as 8.5 billion pesos ($670
million) of the 2022 bonds at a weekly auction today. The
securities have rallied as speculation mounted that inflation
heading to the central bank’s 3 percent target and an outlook
for slower growth will prompt the central bank, known as
Banxico, to cut borrowing costs for the first time since 2009.  “Considerations for a potential Banxico cut are
increasing, and this seems to be the dominant driver in the
markets,”   Aryam Vazquez , a New York-based economist at Wells
Fargo & Co. said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Banco de Mexico reiterated Feb. 13 it may cut its target
rate if inflation continues to slow toward its target after
consumer prices rose 3.25 percent in the 12 months through
January, the slowest pace since October 2011. The central bank
said it’s more probable that growth will slow than pick up,
depending on the performance of the U.S. economy.  Policy makers are scheduled to announce their next interest
rate decision on March 8. They have kept borrowing costs
unchanged at 4.5 percent for 32 straight meetings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
