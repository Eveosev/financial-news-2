Jean-Lou Chameau , president of the
California Institute of Technology, will step down later this
year to become leader of the King Abdullah University of Science
and Technology in Saudi Arabia.  Chameau said he was presented with a life-changing
opportunity to become president of the Saudi school known as
KAUST, according to a  statement  today on Caltech’s website.  “KAUST is positioned to have a dramatic impact on the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Middle East and the world,”
Chameau said. “For that reason, it is more than a university.
It is an undertaking of historic importance.”  Chameau, who holds a Ph.D. in civil engineering from
Stanford University, led Pasadena, California-based Caltech for
seven years. He will be the second president of KAUST, which was
founded as an international graduate research university in 2007
and enrolled its first students in 2009, according to a KAUST
 statement  today.  Details about the search for a new president at Caltech
will be forthcoming from  David Lee , chairman of Caltech’s Board
of Trustees, and John Dabiri, the faculty chair, Chameau said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
