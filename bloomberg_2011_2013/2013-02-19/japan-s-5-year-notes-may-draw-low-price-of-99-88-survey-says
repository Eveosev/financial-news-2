Japan’s sale of 2.7 trillion yen
($28.8 billion) in 5-year notes may have a lowest-accepted price
of 99.88, according to the median forecast of 13 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 0.1 percent
notes ranged from 99.87 to 99.88, according to the survey.  Twelve traders said 99.88 and one trader said 99.87.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
announce the results at 12:45 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
