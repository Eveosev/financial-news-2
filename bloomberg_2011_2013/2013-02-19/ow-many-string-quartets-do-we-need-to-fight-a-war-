In an excellent overview of just how the U.S. Defense Department budget got  bloated to the bursting point , Bloomberg News's Gopal Ratnam gives us this gem: "The size of the Joint Chiefs of Staff office has more than tripled to 4,244 in 2012 from 1,313 in 2010, according to the Pentagon’s annual manpower report."  To be fair, this is in part because many employees of the now-shuttered Joint Forces Command were transferred to the joint chiefs office. Yet the surging size of the office illustrates that weapons programs and foreign wars aren't the only stressors on the Pentagon's finances -- taxpayers are spending ever-more on generals and admirals. On the heels of David Petraeus's unseemly exit from the Central Intelligence Agency, the military brass is uniquely vulnerable to  charges  of living a rock-star lifestyle.   According to a report from the  Project on Government Oversight , an independent watchdog group, the "star-creep" is heaviest at the very top. As the group's Ben Freeman  told Congress  in September:  To soften the blow of having fewer men and women under their command, the generals do get a few perks,  according to  the Washington Post's Rajiv Chandrasekaran and Greg Jaffe: "executive jets, palatial homes, drivers, security guards and aides to carry their bags, press their uniforms and track their schedules in 10-minute increments. Their food is prepared by gourmet chefs. If they want music with their dinner parties, their staff can summon a string quartet or a choir." It's easy to mock the lavish lifestyle, and to forget the long, poorly paid and dangerous slog required to reach the top of the military flagpole. Generals work very hard, and could do far better in the corporate world. But given the tremendous paring the budget is going to take this year, even if the threatened $45 billion in sequestration cuts never comes through, the Pentagon's shared sacrifice will need to include those with a string of stars on their shoulders.   (Tobin Harshaw writes editorials for Bloomberg View.
