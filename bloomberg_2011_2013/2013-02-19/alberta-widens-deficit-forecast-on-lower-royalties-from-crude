Alberta Finance Minister Doug Horner
said the provinceâ€™s deficit for the fiscal year that began on
April 1 will be higher than previously projected on lower
royalties from crude oil.  The deficit for the year will be between C$3.5 billion
($3.5 billion) and C$4 billion, compared with a previous
forecast of C$2.3 billion to C$3 billion, Horner told reporters
in a quarterly fiscal update from Calgary today. Alberta lowered
its projection for U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil to
$91.82 a barrel in the fiscal year, from $92.50, and cut its
forecast for real gross domestic product growth to 2.9 percent
in 2013-2014, from an estimated 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
