Seven French citizens, including
four children, have been taken hostage in Cameroon, President
 Francois Hollande  told journalists in Athens.  French authorities are familiar with the terrorist group,
which is based in Nigeria, he added.  The kidnappings come a day after an Islamist group in
neighboring Nigeria claimed responsibility for taking seven
foreigners hostage at a construction site in the northern state
of Bauchi. The hostages, including four Lebanese, a U.K.
national, a Greek and an Italian, work for Setraco Nigeria Ltd.,
Hassan Mohammed, a police spokesman, said on Feb 17 by phone
from Bauchi, the state capital.  Jamaatu Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladissudan, or “Vanguards
for the Protection of Muslims in the Land of the Blacks,” the
group that took the construction workers hostage, said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday that its action was in response to
“the transgressions and atrocities done to the religion of
Allah” by European nations in countries such as Mali and
Afghanistan.  France, which intervened in Mali to help it restore state
control over a nation that vies with Tanzania as Africa’s third-
biggest gold producer, has about 4,000 troops in that country.  The government of Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, has
been battling Boko Haram, another militant Islamist group, which
has carried out gun and bomb attacks in the north and killed
hundreds of people since 2009. Nigeria, Africa’s most populous
country with more than 160 million people, is roughly split
between the largely Muslim north and the predominantly Christian
south.  To contact the reporters on this story:
