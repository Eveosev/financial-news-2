Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe  will
decide his nominee for the next Bank of Japan governor next
week, once he returns from meeting President  Barack Obama  in
Washington.  “Once the summit is over, he will consider the BOJ
governor candidates,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga
told reporters today in Tokyo. “That should be next week.”  Economy Minister Akira Amari today said Abe will announce
his decision after consulting with opposition parties. The
ruling Liberal Democratic Party lacks a majority in the upper
house of parliament, where the BOJ nominees must be approved.  BOJ Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  and his two deputies will
step down on March 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
