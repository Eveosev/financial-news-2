Chile may receive a cargo of
liquefied natural gas from Trinidad & Tobago today, according to
ship-tracking data.  The LNG Jupiter, with a capacity of 152,880 cubic meters,
is scheduled to arrive at the port of Quintero on Chile’s
central coast, according to ship transmissions captured by IHS
Inc. on Bloomberg. The tanker sailed from the Point Fortin LNG
terminal in Trinidad & Tobago where it loaded its cargo and
departed late January.  Chile has a contract to import 1.7 million metric tons of
LNG annually from  BG Plc’s  portfolio that started in 2009 and
ends in 2030 according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We don’t comment on individual shipments as these
arrangements are confidential between supplier and customer,”
Damien Bird, a BG spokesman in Singapore, said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
