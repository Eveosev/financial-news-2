Pakistan appointed  Saleem Mandviwalla  as the country’s new finance minister without giving
reasons for the change announced three weeks before the five-
year term of the government ends.  Mandviwalla, who has previously served as the chairman of
the Board of Investment and a state minister for finance in the
cabinet of Prime Minister  Raja Pervez Ashraf , took the oath for
his new role in the presidential house this evening, Mehar
Shafique, a media official at his office, said in a text message
to reporters.  Private TV channels, including Geo, reported today that
 Abdul Hafeez Shaikh  had resigned as finance minister. Shaikh and
his spokesman, Rana Asad Amin, didn’t answer telephone calls.  Pakistan is scheduled to appoint a caretaker government in
March, when the term of the current government expires, to
prepare for the general election in mid-May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
