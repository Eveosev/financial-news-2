Brittney Griner scored 21 of her 25
points in the second half as top-ranked Baylor University’s
women’s basketball team pulled away for a 76-70 win over the No.
3 University of Connecticut Huskies.  Griner became the eighth women’s player at college
basketball’s top level to reach the 3,000-point milestone in
extending Baylor’s winning streak to 23 games.  The defending national champion Lady Bears, who trailed by
as many as 11 points in the first half, outscored UConn 50-41
during the second half to improve to 25-1 on the season.  The 6-foot-8 Griner hit 10-of-21 shots, grabbed nine
rebounds and reached the 3,000-point milestone by making two
free throws with one minute, fives seconds left. Jackie Stiles
set the Division I women’s career scoring record of 3,393 points
at Missouri State from 1998-2001.  Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis had 26 points and 15 rebounds for
Connecticut, which fell to 24-2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
