CF Industries Holdings Inc. , the
largest U.S. maker of nitrogen fertilizer, reported fourth-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates amid a “strong”
market for ammonia.  Net income climbed to $470.7 million, or $7.40 a share,
from $438.9 million, or $6.66, a year earlier, the Deerfield,
Illinois-based company said today in a statement. Profit
excluding gas and foreign-exchange derivative gains was $7.27 a
share, topping the $6.96 average of 19  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales declined to $1.48 billion from $1.72 billion a
year earlier, less than the $1.58 billion average of 13
estimates.  CF said it saw record ammonia shipments in 2012. Farmers
are using more nitrogen-based fertilizers after corn futures
reached a record $8.49 a bushel in August and soybeans rose to
their highest ever a month later, putting more money in their
pockets. Cool, dry weather in November in parts of the U.S. also
was conducive to the application of fertilizers.  “Every indication is that weather conditions were decent
this fall,”  Chris Damas , a Barrie, Ontario-based investment
analyst at BCMI Research, said in a telephone interview before
the results were released.  (CF Industries scheduled a conference call for tomorrow at
10 a.m. New York time at +1-800-706-7745 or 617-614-3472. The
passcode is 96930241.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
