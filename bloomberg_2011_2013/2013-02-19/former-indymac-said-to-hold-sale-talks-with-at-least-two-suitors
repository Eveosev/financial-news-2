OneWest Bank FSB, the lender formed
out of the remains of failed IndyMac Bancorp Inc., has held
informal sales talks in recent weeks with at least two potential
buyers, said people familiar with the matter.  UnionBanCal Corp. has expressed interest in Pasadena,
California-based OneWest, said one of the people, who asked not
to be named because the talks are private. Minneapolis-based
 U.S. Bancorp  also held discussions with OneWest and has since
pulled back, that person said.  Billionaires  George Soros  and  John Paulson  formed part of
the private-equity group that rescued IndyMac and revived it as
OneWest in 2009. While OneWest’s owners have made exploratory
calls to determine what price the bank might fetch, a sale isn’t
imminent, and the group also is considering an initial public
offering, another person said.  OneWest, which has absorbed two other failed banks, had
$25.8 billion of assets at Sept. 30 and almost 80 branches,
according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Representatives
at OneWest, UnionBanCal and U.S. Bancorp declined to comment on
the talks. Spokesmen for Soros Fund Management LLC and Paulson &
Co. also declined to comment.  The FDIC seized IndyMac after a run on the lender in 2008
led to the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history. OneWest
Chairman  Steve Mnuchin , a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., led the group that invested $1.55 billion to kickstart
OneWest four years ago. In addition to Paulson and Soros, the
consortium also included  Michael Dell , founder of computer maker
Dell Inc., and  J. Christopher Flowers , who created private-
equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co.  Paulson Stake  The value of Paulson’s stake has more than doubled, and the
investors recouped some of the investment through a $500 million
dividend in the fourth quarter, according to a Paulson letter
sent to investors in January and obtained by Bloomberg News.
OneWest earned $121 million in the third quarter, compared with
a loss of $57 million a year earlier, according to FDIC data.  The Paulson letter indicates that OneWest was valued at
$2.89 billion as of January, based on the $704 million valuation
Duff & Phelps Corp. placed on Paulson’s 24.4 percent stake.
While OneWest’s private-equity owners prefer a sale to an IPO,
it’s seeking a higher price than suitors are so far willing to
pay, one person said.  IndyMac made loans that required no income verification
from borrowers. Suitors are concerned about the quality of its
mortgages, and they also fear that regulators may find fault
with certain loans, the people said.  Unpaid Loans  Borrowers failed to pay interest on about 13 percent of
OneWest’s loans as of Sept. 30, according to regulatory data.
That compares with a median unpaid loan percentage of less than
2 percent in the fourth quarter for the almost 400 banks on the
Nasdaq Bank Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Potential bidders also want to know whether regulators
would be willing to extend a government loss-sharing agreement
on certain IndyMac assets to a new buyer, according to the
people.  U.S. Bancorp  had more than 670 branches in California and
over $350 billion in assets nationwide, according to FDIC data.
OneWest Chief Executive Officer  Joseph Otting  worked at U.S.
Bancorp before taking his current role in 2010.  UnionBanCal, based in San Francisco, is owned by Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc., which last year merged the lender with
Pacific Capital Bancorp of Santa Barbara, California.  To contact the reporters on this story:
