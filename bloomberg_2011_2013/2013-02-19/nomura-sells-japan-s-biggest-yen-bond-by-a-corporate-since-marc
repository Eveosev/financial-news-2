Nomura Holdings Inc.  raised 180
billion yen ($1.9 billion) in Japan’s largest domestic corporate
bond sale in 11 months as yield spreads decline to the lowest
since the March 2011 quake.  The offering by Japan’s biggest brokerage included 69
billion yen of five-year 0.853 percent notes priced to yield 72
basis points more than the similar-maturity government debt,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Takeda Pharmaceutical
Co., Asia’s largest drugmaker, offered 190 billion yen of bonds
in March 2012, the data show.  Sales of corporate bonds in Japan declined 29 percent this
year to 713 billion yen, the lowest for the period since 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Offerings slumped even
as the average yield companies in the country pay to sell debt
declined to  0.78 percent  yesterday, matching the least since
November 2010, Nomura Bond Performance Index data show.  Nomura also sold 66.5 billion yen of 0.605 percent bonds
due in 2016 priced to yield 56 basis points more than government
debt and 44.5 billion yen of 1.249 percent notes maturing in
seven years at a 89 basis point spread, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  extra yield  investors demand to own the nation’s
corporate bonds over government debt declined seven basis points
this year to 47 basis points yesterday, matching the least since
October last year, Nomura Bond index shows.  The company last offered domestic yen bonds in December
when it raised 63 billion yen of 0.8 percent three-year notes
that targeted retail investors, the data show. Japan’s Rating &
Investment Information Inc. ranks the brokerage  A+ , its fifth-
highest investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
