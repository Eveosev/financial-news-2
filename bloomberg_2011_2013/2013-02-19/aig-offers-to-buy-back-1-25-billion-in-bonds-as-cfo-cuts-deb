American International Group Inc. ,
the insurer that repaid a U.S bailout last year, began tender
offers for as much as $1.25 billion of the company’s securities
as Chief Financial Officer  David Herzog  works to lower debt.  The securities include junior subordinated debentures
denominated in pounds and euros, with rates as high as 8.625
percent, the New York-based firm said today in a statement.
Other securities are denominated in dollars and tied to the
SunAmerica Financial Group life insurance unit.  AIG is focusing on “selected and targeted debt reduction”
to cut leverage, Herzog said on a November conference call with
analysts. AIG struck deals to sell more than $70 billion in
assets since 2008, including non-U.S. life insurers, as Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  simplified the company and
repaid the rescue.  “We do have some bonds that are callable that I think make
a lot of sense for us to go after,” AIG Treasurer  Brian Schreiber  said on a Nov. 2 conference call with analysts.  The early participation date for AIG’s tender is March 4,
and March 18 is the expiration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
