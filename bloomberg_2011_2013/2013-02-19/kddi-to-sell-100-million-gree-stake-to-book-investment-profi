KDDI Corp. , Japan’s second-biggest
wireless carrier, plans to sell a $100 million stake in mobile-
game operator  Gree Inc.  to book a profit from its six-year
investment.  The carrier has asked  Daiwa Securities Group Inc . to sell 8
million Gree shares between Feb. 13 and May 12, it said in a
regulatory filing today. KDDI, the second-largest shareholder in
 Gree , will retain 8 million shares, or about 3 percent.  “We can profit from the sale,” Keiichi Sakurai, a
spokesman for Tokyo-based KDDI, said by phone today. “The sale
will also let Gree do business more freely.”  Gree  has more than doubled in Tokyo trading since listing
in 2008 on rising mobile phone usage and the popularity of games
including “Monster Quest” and “Crime City”. This year, the
company has fallen 14 percent after  forecasting  a decline in
annual  profit  because of delays to new games and costs from
expanding overseas.  The  game developer  rose 2.7 percent to 1,154 yen in Tokyo
trading today before the KDDI announcement. KDDI first invested
in the company in 2006, according to Gree’s  website .  “There won’t be any change in our relationship,”  Shinichi Iriyama , a Gree spokesman, said by phone. “We will continue
building a good relationship with KDDI.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
