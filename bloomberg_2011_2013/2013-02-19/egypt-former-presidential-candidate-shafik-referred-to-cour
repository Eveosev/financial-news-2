Egypt’s former Prime Minister  Ahmed Shafik , his daughters and 10 other officials were referred to a
criminal court on charges of profiteering, facilitating the
seizure of public funds and forging official documents.  Shafik, who lost Egypt’s first democratically held
presidential election in June to  Mohamed Mursi , is accused of
allocating state-owned land to a company without offering it for
tender, the ministry of justice said in a faxed statement today.  Hisham Mourad, Shafik’s lawyer, denied the accusations. He
said “the case is political and not criminal, and aims to
defame Shafik,” when reached by phone in Cairo.  Shafik isn’t currently in Egypt, Mourad said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
