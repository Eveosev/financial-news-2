Pig prices rose for a second week in
the north of the European Union and advanced for a third week in
Spain and France, industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V. reported.  Hog prices in Germany, the EU’s biggest pork producer,
climbed to 1.656 euros ($2.21) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from
1.626 euros last week, while in Spain, the second-biggest
supplier, the price rose to 1.794 euros from 1.764 euros, Damme,
Germany-based ISN wrote in an online  report  today.  Pork accounts for about half of meat consumption in the EU.
Average consumption of pork in the 27-nation bloc is set to fall
to 40.26 kilograms a person this year from 41.15 kilograms in
2012 due to the economic downturn and high levels of
unemployment, the EU forecast last month.  “In the current slaughtering week the EU price increase
heralded in the previous week continues,” ISN wrote. In
Germany, “pigs can be sold easily and quickly,” it said.  In France, the EU’s third-biggest pig producer, prices
climbed to 1.628 euros a kilogram from 1.573 euros.  Dutch, Danish, Belgian, Austrian and U.K. pig prices also
advanced, while the cost of pigs was unchanged from the previous
week in Italy and Ireland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
