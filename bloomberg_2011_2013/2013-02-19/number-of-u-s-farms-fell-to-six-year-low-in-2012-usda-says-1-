The number of farms in the U.S., the
worldâ€™s biggest agriculture exporter, fell 0.5 percent in 2012
to the lowest since 2006, the government said.  Farm operations dropped to 2.17 million, compared with 2.18
million in 2011, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today
in a  report  on its website. The amount of land in use for
cultivation or livestock production declined to 914 million
acres from 917 million in 2011, while the average farm size
increased to 421 acres from 420.  The total number of cattle operations slumped to 915,000
from 922,000 in 2011, the USDA said. Beef-cow producers totaled
729,000, down from 734,000. The U.S. cattle herd, including beef
and dairy animals, totaled 89.3 million head as of Jan. 1, the
fewest since 1952, USDA data show. Hog and pig operations were
68,300, down from 69,100.  Net farm  income  totaled $112.8 billion in 2012, the USDA
said last week, and the government has forecast a 14 percent
climb this year to a record $128.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
