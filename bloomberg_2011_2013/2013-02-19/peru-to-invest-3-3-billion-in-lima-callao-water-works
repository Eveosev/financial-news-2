Peru’s largest water company,
 Sedapal , plans to invest 8.44 billion soles ($3.3 billion) in
drinking water infrastructure in Lima and the neighboring port
of Callao over the next three years.  Housing and Construction Minister  Rene Cornejo  said in the
Peruvian capital that the state water company will build
reservoirs, wells and water-treatment plants as well as replace
5,000 kilometers (3,000 miles) of water pipes in Lima. About 1.9
million of Lima’s 9 million residents don’t have access to
running water, he said yesterday at a news conference.  Lima also aims to treat 100 percent of its wastewater by
2015, Cornejo said. The  Taboada  sewage treatment plant started
last year by Spain’s  Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA 
will treat 74 percent of Lima’s wastewater by August while work
is to begin this year on  Acciona SA ’s La Chira plant, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
