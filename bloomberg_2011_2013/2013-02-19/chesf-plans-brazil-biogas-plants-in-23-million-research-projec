 Cia. Hidro Eletrica do Sao
Francisco, a unit of state-controlled power utility Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras SA, plans to build four plants that
generate electricity from biogas as part of a 45 million-real
($23 million) research project.  Two facilities will burn gas emitted from urban waste and
the other two will use agricultural residues, the Recife,
Brazil-based company said today on its website. They will have
total capacity of 2.4 megawatts.  The research project also envisages the construction of a
laboratory dedicated to biogas, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
