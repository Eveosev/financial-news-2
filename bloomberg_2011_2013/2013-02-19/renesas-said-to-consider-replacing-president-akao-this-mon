Renesas Electronics Corp ., the
Japanese chipmaker getting a bailout from a state-backed fund,
may replace President  Yasushi Akao  this month, a company
official said.  The company may name Senior Vice President  Tetsuya Tsurumaru  to succeed Akao, said the official, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t yet public. Tsurumaru,
58, started at Hitachi Ltd. in 1979 and spent most of his career
in production after joining Renesas’s predecessor company in
2003, according to the manufacturer’s  website .  The new president would take over in the midst of a
restructuring effort that includes more than 10,500 job cuts
announced since July as Renesas tries to recover from losses
amid falling demand for its system LSI chips. The company plans
to sell 150 billion yen ($1.6 billion) of new shares to
investors led by state-backed Innovation Network Corp. of Japan
as part of a bailout.  The Nikkei newspaper said earlier today Tsurumaru will be
named president. Renesas wasn’t the source of the report, and no
decision has been made, the Kawasaki-based company said in a
statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Renesas, which supplies  Apple Inc . and  Nintendo Co .,
widened its full-year net loss forecast to 176 billion yen on
Feb. 8 because of lower-than-expected orders in the fourth
quarter and charges to write down its assets.  The company’s shares rose 2.8 percent to 262 yen as of
11:46 a.m. in Tokyo, trimming their decline this year to 14
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
