Dubai Electricity & Water Authority
plans to raise as much as $1 billion from the sale of Islamic
bonds this month to refinance debt maturing in June, Chief
Executive Officer  Saeed Al Tayer  said.  The state-owned utility, known as Dewa, mandated Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc, Citigroup Inc., Standard Chartered Plc,
Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC, Emirates NBD Capital Ltd. and Dubai
Islamic Bank PJSC, to help manage the sale, Al Tayer said.
Meetings with potential investors will be held in London and
Asia next week, he said.  “We’re going for the cheapest option and sukuk is the
cheapest now,” Al Tayer told reporters in Dubai today.  Issuers in Dubai are tapping the debt market after
borrowing costs tumbled in the past year. Dewa last sold bonds
in October 2010, when it raised $2 billion from the sale of six-
year and 10-year securities at coupons of 6.375 percent and
7.375 percent. The yields were at 2.78 percent and 4.01 percent
respectively at 12:15 p.m. in Dubai, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The yield on the 10-year bond has tumbled 2.83
percentage points in the past year.  Dewa has a flexible funding strategy and may need to raise
more funds for projects through the year, Al Tayer said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
