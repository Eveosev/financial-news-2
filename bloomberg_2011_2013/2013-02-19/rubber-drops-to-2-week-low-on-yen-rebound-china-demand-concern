Rubber futures declined to the
lowest level in more than two weeks as a stronger yen cut the
appeal of the contracts denominated in the Japanese currency,
and as concerns grew that demand from China may weaken.  The contract for July delivery lost as much as 2.8 percent
to 315.2 yen a kilogram ($3,359 a metric ton), the lowest level
since Feb. 1, before trading at 319.6 yen on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange at 10:25 a.m. The drop pared this year’s gain for the
most-active contract to 5.7 percent.  The yen traded at 93.81 per dollar after touching 94.46 on
Feb. 11, the weakest since May 2010. Japan’s Finance Minister
Taro Aso said the government isn’t considering changing laws
governing the central bank. Retail sales in China gained at the
slowest pace since 2009 during last week’s Lunar New Year
festival, a Ministry of Commerce statement showed Feb. 15.  “The market was weighed down by concerns about the
strength of Chinese demand,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at
broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said today by phone. “Futures in
Tokyo also lost support from the currency market.”  Natural-rubber stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 1,201 tons to 100,015 tons, nearing an almost
three-year high reached in January, data from the bourse showed
on Feb. 8. The figures will be updated on Feb. 22. The contract
for September delivery on the exchange was little changed at
26,225 yuan ($4,201) a ton.  Thai rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 97.45 baht
($3.26) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand. Output in Thailand’s southern provinces,
the main production area, is expected to decline in the next few
weeks, the institute said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
