Cuadrilla Resources Ltd. is in
advanced talks to sell a stake in its U.K. shale gas operations,
according to shareholder AJ Lucas Group Ltd.  “Cuadrilla’s negotiations with leading energy companies
are at an advanced stage,” Sydney-based AJ Lucas, said in a
 presentation  this month. Definitive documents are being
finalized, it said.  Cuadrilla Chairman John Browne declined to comment today
while attending a conference in London.  The British government’s lifting of a moratorium on
hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, at the end of last
year, opens the way for companies to begin drilling wells and
tap into shale resources that made the U.S. the top natural gas
producer. Cuadrilla’s Bowland Basin in northwest England holds
about 200 trillion cubic feet of gas, the company has said,
although only a fraction of that will be recovered.  “Cuadrilla is currently negotiating a farm-in to Bowland
with a leading energy company,” said AJ Lucas, 43.7 percent
shareholder in Cuadrilla, without naming the potential investor.  Total SA Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie
said last week France’s largest oil company was considering
investing in U.K. shale drilling. Royal Dutch Shell Plc CEO
Peter Voser has also said it’s looking at investing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
