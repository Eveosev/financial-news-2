General Mills Inc ., the maker of
Cheerios cereal, said profit would rise at a high single-digit
percentage rate in fiscal 2014 and reiterated its earnings
forecast for this year.  “We see stronger growth in our future,” Chief Executive
Officer  Ken Powell  said in a statement today. Analysts project
an increase of 8 percent to $2.90 per share, according to the
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  In the fiscal year ending in May 2014, General Mills also
plans to return more cash to investors through share
repurchasing and dividend growth, Chief Financial Officer  Don Mulligan  said in the statement. Net sales from international
operations are expected to exceed $5 billion in fiscal 2013,
General Mills said.  General Mills, the owner of Yoplait yogurt and Pillsbury
cookie dough,  rose  0.9 percent to $44.99 at 8:19 a.m. in New
York. The shares had gained 10 percent this year through Feb.
15, compared to an increase of 6.6 percent for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  The Minneapolis-based company also reiterated its earnings
guidance for the fiscal year ending May 26 of $2.65 to $2.67 a
share before certain items. Analysts projected $2.68, on
average.  General Mills  and  ConAgra Foods Inc.  will be presenting at
the Consumer Analyst Group of New York investor conference
today.  ConAgra, the maker of Banquet frozen meals and Orville
Redenbacher popcorn, forecast earnings per share excluding some
items for the fiscal year ending May 31 of $2.15. Analysts
projected $2.13, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  ConAgra’s $5 billion purchase of Ralcorp Holdings Inc. will
add 5 cents per share to earnings this fiscal year and 25 cents
in 2014, the company said. ConAgra completed the acquistion of
Ralcorp, which sells cookies and pasta under retailers’ own
brands, on Jan. 30.  The shares  declined  0.1 percent to $33.73 on Feb. 15. For
the year, ConAgra advanced 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
