The U.K. was a net-importer of wheat
for a seventh-straight month in December, after excess rain
reduced the past season’s harvest.  Wheat purchases climbed to 305,584 metric tons in December,
more than triple the amount in the same month a year earlier and
up 36 percent from November, the Agriculture and Horticulture
Development Board said today in an e-mailed report, citing
customs figures. Exports for the month dropped to 35,130 tons,
the lowest since August. Cumulative  imports  since the marketing
year began July 1 totaled 1.342 million tons, against exports of
512,129 tons.  The U.K. had its second-wettest year on record in 2012,
according to the Met Office, the national weather forecaster.
Farmers harvested 13.26 million tons of the grain, 13 percent
less than a year earlier, according to the Department for
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs.  Germany was the biggest supplier of wheat to the U.K.
during December at 107,004 tons, followed by Canada at 55,091
tons, according to today’s report. The U.S. shipped 18,492 tons,
ranking it fifth, behind Denmark and France, AHDB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
