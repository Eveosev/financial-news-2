The  yield difference  between U.K.
two- and 10-year government bonds widened to the most in almost
11 months before the nation auctions the longer-maturity debt
this week.  The pound dropped to seven-month low versus the dollar
before the Bank of England releases the minutes of its February
meeting tomorrow and the U.K. issues unemployment data. The
Monetary Policy Committee kept its main  interest rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent when it met on Feb. 7. U.K. gilts are the
worst-performing sovereign debt this year, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies.  “With the front end anchored by low rates, the curve
steepens when the market sells off,” said  Jason Simpson , a
fixed-income strategist at Banco Santander SA in London.
“Obviously it is slightly unusual today in that yields are
lower but the curve steeper, so the performance of 10-year bonds
must be inhibited by Thursday’s auction.”  The 10-year gilt yield dropped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.19 percent at 4:35 p.m. London time after
climbing to 2.27 percent on Feb. 14, the  highest  since April 2.
The price of the 1.75 percent gilt due in September 2022 gained
0.09, or 90 pence per 1,000-pound ($1,542) face amount, to
96.275.  The yield spread between the bonds and two-year securities
was little changed at 188 basis points, after widening to 190
basis points, the most since March 22.  The Debt Management Office is due to auction 2.25 billion
pounds of the 10-year securities on Thursday.  Worst Performer  U.K. government bonds lost 2.8 percent this year through
yesterday, the worst performer of the 26 Bloomberg/EFFAS
indexes. German bonds dropped 1.5 percent and Treasuries fell
0.9 percent.  Sterling weakened for a second day versus the euro after
central bank policy maker  Martin Weale  endorsed the currency’s
decline, saying on the weekend it may help bolster exports.  The pound dropped 0.3 percent to $1.5425 after falling to
$1.5416, the lowest since July 13. It weakened 0.4 percent to
86.70 pence per euro after depreciating 0.3 percent yesterday.  U.K. jobless  claims  declined by 5,500 from December, when
they dropped 12,100 to 1.56 million, the lowest since June 2011,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The London-based Office for National Statistics
will release the data tomorrow.  “You could argue the majority of the negativity has been
priced in,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of foreign-exchange
strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London.
“However, if we see more bad news from the unemployment numbers
then that could be another catalyst for a weaker sterling.”  The pound has fallen 5 percent this year, the second-worst
performer after the yen among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 0.7 percent and the euro rose 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
