Indonesia’s bonds rose, pushing the
two-year yield to the lowest in a year, as official data showed
foreign investors quickened purchases of the nation’s debt.
Rupiah forwards declined for a fourth day.  Global funds added  3.3 trillion rupiah  ($340 million) to
holdings of local sovereign debt this month through Feb. 14, set
to be the biggest monthly increase since November, figures from
the finance ministry show. Indonesian two-year notes pay 406
basis points, or 4.06 percentage points, more than U.S.
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Foreigners have been buying quite aggressively so yields
are declining across the board,” said  Nurul Eti Nurbaeti ,
Jakarta-based head of treasury research at PT Bank Negara
Indonesia. “There is still room for the rally to continue, with
short-term notes benefiting from the yield differential.”  The yield on Indonesia’s 11 percent securities due October
2014 dropped one basis point to 4.34 percent as of 8:57 a.m. in
Jakarta, the lowest level since February 2012, according to
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  The government plans to raise 1.5 trillion rupiah selling
Islamic debt due in five years to 24 years today, according to a
statement on the finance ministry’s website.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.3
percent to 9,739 per dollar, the weakest level since Feb. 7,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts traded at a 0.2
percent discount to the spot rate, which dropped 0.4 percent to
9,715, according to prices from local banks. Non-deliverable
forwards are settled in dollars.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was
set at 9,676 yesterday by the Association of Banks in Singapore,
from 9,681 on Feb. 15.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose 10
basis points to 6.08 percent, the highest level since Feb. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
