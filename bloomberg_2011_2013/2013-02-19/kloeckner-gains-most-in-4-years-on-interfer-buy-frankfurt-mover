Kloeckner & Co . SE, Europe’s largest
independent steel trader, rose the most in almost four years in
Frankfurt as Interfer Holding GmbH bought a 7.82 percent stake.  The company rose as much as 12 percent, the biggest advance
since April 2009. Interfer owns Kloeckner’s rival Knauf Interfer
SE, which is planning to expand, and said today in a statement
that the deal was a “strategic investment.” Interfer Holding
belongs to the family of Dortmund-based entrepreneur  Albrecht Knauf , 70. Anja Kleine-Wilde, a company spokeswoman, declined to
comment on whether Albrecht Knauf would raise his stake further.  “Kloeckner shares are priced relatively attractively,”
 Christian Obst , a Baader Bank AG analyst, said of the Duisburg,
Germany-based company. “It’s not a bad time to buy now.”  The company rose 10 percent to 10.37 euros by 12:03 p.m. in
Frankfurt with about 3.4 million shares traded, five times the
three-month daily average. Obst’s price estimate is 14 euros.  Knauf Interfer had sales of about 1 million metric tons and
1,600 staff in 2012, while revenue was about 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion) the year before, Kleine-Wilde said by phone from
Essen. The company doesn’t have operations outside of Europe,
while Kloeckner has businesses in the U.S. and Asia.  Kloeckner’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization would rise to at least 190 million euros this
year on cost cuts, Chief Executive Officer  Gisbert Ruehl  told
Deutsches Anleger Fernsehen in January. Ruehl saw “hope” for a
recovery in demand in the second half and an increase in 2014,
driven by China and the U.S., he told the broadcaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
