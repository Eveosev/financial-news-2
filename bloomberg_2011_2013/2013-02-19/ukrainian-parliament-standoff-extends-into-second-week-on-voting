Ukrainian opposition parties blocked
Parliament for a second week to protest lawmakers who vote on
behalf of absent colleagues, prompting threats that President
 Viktor Yanukovych  may dissolve the legislature.  Jailed ex-Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko ’s party, world
boxing champion  Vitali Klitschko ’s UDAR and the right-wing
Svoboda surrounded the speaker’s rostrum today in the capital,
Kiev. UDAR lawmakers have stayed in Parliament since Feb. 5,
including at night, attaching stickers saying “vote for
yourself” to the seats of pro-presidential deputies.  Yanukovych may exercise his right to dissolve Parliament if
it fails to function for 30 days, Vitaliy Zhuravskyi, a member
of the president’s Party of Regions, said today on parliamentary
TV channel Rada. Klitschko called the threat a “bluff,”
according to a statement on his website. Yanukovych’s
spokeswoman, Darka Chepak, couldn’t comment immediately when
called by Bloomberg.  While the Party of Regions got more votes than its rivals
in Oct. 28 elections, it fell short of a majority and relies on
support from the Communists and independent lawmakers to pass
legislation. Opposition parties, which boosted their number of
seats, are demanding technological changes to the existing
parliamentary voting system to stop absent lawmakers’
identification cards being used to submit ballots.  To contact the reporters on this story:
