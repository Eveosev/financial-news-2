Copper futures in New York fell the
most in four months as a drop in U.S. homebuilder confidence and
speculation that China will move to cool property purchases
damped demand prospects for the metal used in pipes and wiring.  Builder sentiment in February fell to 46 from January’s 47
that matched the highest reading since April 2006, a National
Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo report showed today.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists
projected a rise to 48. China Business News reported that the
nation may introduce more policies to curb property prices.  “Any sign that China may be limiting its real-estate
market is certainly concerning from a demand perspective,”
 David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision Financial
Markets in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The
builder-confidence report is one more slight negative for the
market.”  Copper futures for May delivery dropped 2.3 percent to
settle at $3.6665 a pound at 1:13 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
the biggest decline for a most-active contract since Oct. 19.
Floor trading was closed yesterday for a public holiday. China
is the world’s top consumer of industrial metals, followed by
the U.S.  The Copper Development Association says that construction
generates 40 percent of demand for the metal. Readings lower
than 50 in the U.S. homebuilder index mean more respondents said
conditions were poor.  Stockpiles  of copper monitored by the London Metal Exchange
gained 1.7 percent to 411,250 metric tons, the highest since
November 2011.  Orders  to withdraw the metal from warehouses
decreased 6.3 percent, the most since Jan. 24.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months fell 0.8
percent to $8,050 a ton ($3.65 a pound). The price dropped 1.1
percent yesterday.  Tin, lead, aluminum and nickel also fell in London. Zinc
was unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
