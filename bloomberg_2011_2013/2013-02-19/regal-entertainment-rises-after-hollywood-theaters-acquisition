Regal Entertainment Group  rose as
much as 3.8 percent after the largest U.S. cinema owner agreed
to acquire Hollywood Theaters Inc. for $191 million in cash.  Regal  advanced  2.2 percent to $15.66 at 2:52 p.m. in New
York after the Knoxville, Tennessee-based company reached
$15.92. The shares had gained about 10 percent this year through
Feb. 15, compared with a 6.6 percent increase for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  The purchase is part of Regal’s strategy of acquiring
chains that add to the company’s cash flow, Chief Executive
Officer  Amy Miles  said in a statement today. Regal gains 43
locations with 513 screens with the addition of closely held,
Portland, Oregon-based Hollywood Theaters. Regal currently
operates 6,880 screens in 540 locations.  “This move represents a solid use of the inexpensive
capital availability and reinforces the main rationale behind
our upgrade to buy from neutral on 12/19/12,”  Eric Wold , an
analyst with B. Riley Caris in San Francisco, said today in a
note. “Regal is well-positioned to once again generate results
above expectations in 2013 driven by its leading industry
position on a robust film slate.”  Regal operations include the Regal, Edwards and United
Artists chains, across the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
