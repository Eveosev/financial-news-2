The Canadian dollar fell to the
lowest level against its U.S. counterpart since July as policy
makers in the world’s largest economy seek to avoid budget cuts,
known as sequestration, set to begin next month.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, declined for a
third straight day as West Texas Intermediate oil extended the
biggest drop in two weeks while Brent crude was little changed.
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said in a CTV News interview
on Feb. 15 that recent signs of weakness in the housing market
may persist over several years.  Canada’s dollar is “quite weak,”  Camilla Sutton , head of
currency strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia, said by phone from
Toronto. “Anything that’s negative for U.S. gross domestic
product is negative for Canada.”  The loonie fell 0.3 percent to C$1.0135 per U.S. dollar at
8:17 a.m. in Toronto, the weakest since July 26. One loonie buys
98.69 U.S. cents.  U.S. lawmakers agreed to automatic spending cuts, to be
spread over nine years, as part of a 2011 fiscal deal to raise
the debt limit. The reductions were supposed to be so onerous
that Congress and the president would never let them occur and
would find a plan to replace them. The U.S. is Canada’s largest
trade partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
