A prison officer in Britain was
charged with committing misconduct in public office for
allegedly taking a bribe from  News Corp .’s Sun tabloid in
exchange for information about a high-profile prisoner.  Richard Trunkfield, an operational support officer at
Woodhill prison in Milton Keynes, England, accepted 3,350 pounds
($5,200) from journalists at the Sun in 2010, the Crown
Prosecution Service said today  in a statement .  Trunkfield “willfully misconducted himself to such a
degree as to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust,”
prosecutors said in the statement.  Operation Elveden, the bribery probe that grew out of an
investigation into phone hacking at News Corp. newspapers, has
led to 61 arrests, including members of the military, Sun
journalists and two serving police officers detained last week
on suspicion of leaking confidential information about well-
known people.  Rebekah Brooks , the former chief executive officer
of News Corp.’s U.K. publisher, was charged in November.  The bribery investigation is running parallel to the probe
into voice-mail interception by News Corp.’s other U.K. tabloid,
the News of the World, which Chairman  Rupert Murdoch  closed in
July 2011 in response to the scandals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
