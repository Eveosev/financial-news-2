West Texas Intermediate oil rose
after operators said the flow of crude on the Seaway pipeline
will climb and as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index surged to a
five-year high.  WTI increased 0.8 percent as  Enterprise Products Partners
LP  said Seaway volumes will average 295,000 barrels a day
between February and May, up from 180,000 barrels in January.
Traders are counting on the pipeline to cut a historic  supply
glut  at Cushing, Oklahoma, where Nymex futures are delivered.
The premium of Brent oil traded in London to WTI slipped on
Seaway and proposed changes to North Sea pricing formulas.  “WTI is showing strength because we’re looking for Seaway
to move over 100,000 barrels more oil in February compared with
last month, which will ease the bottlenecks in the
midcontinent,” said  Jacob Correll , a Louisville, Kentucky-based
analyst at Summit Energy Inc., which manages more than $20
billion in companies’ annual energy spending. “The strength in
equity markets is spilling over into the crude market.”  WTI futures for March delivery, which expire tomorrow,
gained 80 cents to settle at $96.66 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The more-active April contract rose 69
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $97.10. The volume of all futures
traded was 5.6 percent above the 100-day average at 3:25 p.m.  Floor trading in New York was closed yesterday because of
the Presidents Day holiday in the U.S. Yesterday’s electronic
transactions will be booked with today’s trades for settlement.  Brent Declines  Brent oil for April settlement increased 14 cents to
$117.52 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Trading volume was 32 percent below the 100-day
average.  The front-month European benchmark grade tightened to a
$20.42 premium to April WTI futures. The gap expanded to $23.18
on Feb. 8, the widest since Nov. 26. The spread had grown since
Enterprise said Jan. 23 that a bottleneck at Seaway’s Jones
Creek terminal in Texas will remain in place until the end of
2013, slowing the movement of oil.  A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale
formations, causing output to surge and boosting Cushing
supplies to a record 51.9 million barrels in January, according
to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. They were at 50.2 million in the
week ended Feb. 8.  U.S. oil  production  rose 67,000 barrels a day to 7.06
million in the week ended Feb. 8, the most since December 1992,
the EIA said Feb. 13.  Seaway Capacity  Seaway won’t reach its planned capacity given the
anticipated mix of light and heavy crude oil,  William Ordemann ,
senior vice president at Enterprise, said in Feb. 15  testimony 
before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Surging U.S. output has led to the development of rail
routes to make up for the Seaway delays.  “Seaway isn’t going to reach full capacity when people
were expecting,”  Bill O’Grady , chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees
$1.4 billion. “Other routes have been developed to make up for
the delayed start of the line. When there’s an arbitrage this
big, the market is going to find ways to profit from it.”  Cushing Glut  Brent oil has dropped for four days. Platts announced
changes to the pricing of the Ekofisk and Oseberg North Sea
grades, two of the four components in the the Dated Brent marker
used to price more than half the world’s oil.  Ekofisk and Oseberg will be adjusted to account for their
superior quality,  Jorge Montepeque , global director of markets
and pricing at the unit of McGraw-Hill Cos., said yesterday. The
other two grades are Brent and Forties.  “The Brent-WTI is coming in quite a bit,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund that focuses on energy. “The Platts news about the Brent
pricing structure, along with what we’ve heard from Shell and
other majors, is putting downward pressure on Brent. This will
effectively increase the supply of Brent.”  Oil rebounded in the afternoon as the  S&P 500 Index  surged
after investor confidence in Germany climbed to the highest
level since April 2010. The S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent and Dow
Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent.  Gasoline Prices  Falling fuel prices are weighing on the crude market, said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester, Massachusetts. Gasoline futures dropped from the
highest level in more than four months as surging pump prices
raised concern that demand may ebb.  “It looks like gasoline market has overreached,” Lynch
said. “Retail prices have climbed a lot more than is justified
given the less-than-robust economic recovery. The market is
ready for a correction.”  Gasoline for March delivery declined 1.33 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $3.1212 a gallon on the Nymex. Futures
touched $3.1639 in intraday trading on Feb. 15, the highest
level since Sept. 28.  The  retail  price for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 1.8 cents to $3.748 a gallon, the highest level since Oct.
16, AAA said today on its website. Prices have risen every day
since Jan. 16, advancing 45.6 cents.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 495,555
contracts as of 3:25 p.m. It totaled 696,266 contracts Feb. 15,
33 percent above the three-month average. Open interest was 1.66
million on Feb. 15, just short of the previous day’s record 1.67
million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
