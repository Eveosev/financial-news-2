Nickel fell to the lowest level in
three weeks as lead declined to a one-week low on concerns that
demand in China may not be strong enough to absorb rising
supplies.  Nickel for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange declined as much as 0.8 percent to $17,720 a metric
ton, the lowest since Jan. 29, while lead fell as much as 0.5
percent to $2,379.75 a ton, the lowest since Feb. 12. The  LME
Index  of six primary metals lost 1.5 percent to 3,546.9
yesterday, the lowest since Jan. 29.  China may introduce more policies to curb property prices
before or after the National People’s Congress annual session
next month, China Business News reported today, citing
researchers including Xie Yifeng. A gauge of property stocks in
the Shanghai index tumbled as much as 5.1 percent today, the
most among five industry groups.  “The concern is that physical market activity may not pick
up in March as many had expected,” Yuan Zheng, an analyst at
East Asia Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  LME nickel  stockpiles  rose to 154,122 tons on Feb. 12, the
highest since April 2010, and were at 153,270 tons yesterday,
exchange data showed. Recycled battery lead from electric
bicycles is leaving China with the largest glut in six years.  Copper, aluminum, zinc and tin in London also declined.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
