Danica Patrick  remains a longshot to
win the Daytona 500, according to Las Vegas oddsmakers, even
after becoming the first female to earn the pole position in the
55-year history of Nascar’s season-opening race.  Patrick, 30, earned the first starting spot for Nascar’s
Feb. 24 marquee event by posting the fastest qualifying lap two
days ago at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona, Florida.  Patrick finished  38th  in her Daytona 500 debut last year
after her car was damaged on a second-lap crash and has 40-1
odds of winning this year, according to the Las Vegas Hotel’s
Super Book. Twenty other drivers in the 43-car field have better
odds of winning than Patrick, who made 10 starts in Sprint Cup
events a year ago in her full-time Nascar debut.  “I have no doubt that I’ll be extremely nervous,” Patrick
told reporters. “There will be 42 anxious drivers behind me
trying to get ahead. It’s a handful.”  Patrick two days ago posted the fastest lap time of 45.817
seconds and her top speed of 196.434 miles per hour (316.13
kilometers per hour) was the fastest in Daytona 500 qualifying
since 1990. It made Patrick the first female driver to win the
pole for any race in Nascar’s top series, the Sprint Cup.  The best previous qualifying position by a woman was a pair
of ninth-place starts by Janet Guthrie in 1977. Guthrie started
18th in the 1980 Daytona 500, the previous best start for a
woman at “The Great American Race.”  Patrick previously earned a pole position in Nascar’s
second-tier Nationwide Series, as did  Shawna Robinson  in 1994.
Patrick held the pole at last year’s season-opening Nationwide
Series race at Daytona and finished 38th.  Best Finishes  In 10 previous Sprint Cup races, Patrick’s best finish is
17th place. She has one top-five finish in 58 career starts on
the Nationwide Series.  “I have a lot to learn,” Patrick said. “I’m a rookie and
I am going to be learning as much as I can for 499 or maybe
until the last 10 laps. When you implement your plan, it depends
where you are. Hopefully at the end of 500 we’re rolling and we
have a chance.”  Matt Kenseth  won the 2012 Daytona 500, which was run at
night after being pushed back a day by rain. Kenseth is listed
as the 8-1 favorite for this week’s race, meaning a winning $100
bet would return a $800 profit.  Kyle Busch  and  Kevin Harvick  have 10-1 odds, followed by
 Jimmie Johnson ,  Denny Hamlin , Brad Keselowski,  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  and  Tony Stewart  at 12-1. Patrick is racing for the Stewart-
Haas Racing team that’s co-owned by Stewart and had three of the
five fastest cars in qualifying.  Turning Heads  “She’s going to turn some heads this summer,” Stewart
said. “Whether it’s consistent or whether it’s one or two races
at a time, none of us really know. The thing that I caution is,
everybody puts high expectations. We feel like she’s got the
tools and mindset to go out and do a good job each week.”  The last driver to win the Daytona 500 from the pole
position was  Dale Jarrett  in 2000.  Jeff Gordon  also won it from
the pole in 1999 and qualified second alongside Patrick for this
weekend’s race. The starting positions for the rest of field
will be determined in qualifying races on Feb. 21.  “I’m proud to be on the front row this year side-by-side
with Danica,” said Gordon, who has 15-1 odds to win. “I’ve
always been a big believer in what’s good for the sport is good
for all of us. So this is great for the sport. The rest of us
will benefit from that, as well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
