Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd . fell
the most in almost two weeks, leading a drop in casinos as HSBC
Global Research said gambling revenue lagged behind its
projection for the first 17 days of February.  Galaxy plunged 4.9 percent to HK$33.15, headed for the
biggest decline since Feb. 6. Billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ’s
 Sands China Ltd . dropped 4.4 percent and Wynn Macau Ltd. lost
2.9 percent.  Macau’s gambling revenue for the first 17 days of February
came in at 15.2 billion patacas ($1.9 billion) and was below
HSBC’s estimates,  Sean Monaghan , a Singapore-based analyst wrote
in a research note dated Feb. 18. VIP, or high-stakes, gamblers
may have stayed away to avoid crowds during the New Year
holiday, HSBC said.  SJM Holdings Ltd. dropped 5.3 percent, while MGM China
Holdings Ltd. fell 3.9 percent and Melco Crown Entertainment
Ltd. declined 2.1 percent.  Macau tourist arrivals pulled back to 127,412 on Feb. 16
from a peak of 166,581 on Feb. 12 during last week’s Lunar New
Year holiday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from Macau
government statistics.  While mainland tourist arrivals over the Lunar New Year
rose 20 percent from the year-earlier holiday, that has not
filtered into revenue growth for the industry, CLSA said in a
research note today. It downgraded  Wynn Macau  to outperform from
buy.  Macau’s casino revenue climbed 14 percent to a record 304
billion patacas ($38 billion) last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
