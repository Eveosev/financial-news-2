Spain’s bonds advanced, with 10-year
yield falling toward the lowest level in two weeks, as an
improvement in German investor confidence boosted demand for
higher-yielding sovereign debt.  Spanish  two-year notes  rose for the first time in four days
as borrowing costs fell when the nation sold 4 billion euros
($5.3 billion) of three- and nine-month bills. German bunds were
little changed before the country auctions 10-year securities
tomorrow. Belgium’s debt agency plans to sell five-year notes
through banks this week. Economists said a report tomorrow will
show  consumer confidence  in the euro-area improved this month.  “The data flow is improving and that makes the market
raise its expectations for other sentiment indicators,” said
 Michael Leister , a London-based fixed-income strategist at
Commerzbank AG. “Spanish and Italian bonds are reversing their
earlier losses.”  Spain ’s 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.19 percent at 4:03 p.m. London time after
dropping to 5.16 percent on Feb. 14, the lowest since Feb. 1.
The 5.4 percent bond due in January 2023 rose 0.315, or 3.15
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.58.  Italy’s 10-year yield dropped one basis point to 4.40
percent after earlier rising as much as five basis points.  Germany’s central bank said yesterday it expects the
country to return to growth this quarter as confidence improves
and the global economy gains strength.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research said its
 index  of investor and analyst expectations climbed to 48.2 from
31.5 in January. That’s the highest since April 2010. Economists
forecast a gain to 35, according to the median of 38 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Spanish Auction  Spain sold 3.1 billion euros of three-month bills at an
average yield of 0.421 percent, down from 0.441 percent at a
previous auction on Jan. 22. The nine-month securities, which
were sold for the first time, yielded 1.144 percent. Spain will
auction debt due in 2015, 2019 and 2023 on Feb. 21.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yielded 1.62 percent after falling
to 1.58 percent on Feb. 8, the lowest level since Jan. 25. The
nation  last sold  10-year debt on Jan. 16 at an average yield of
1.56 percent.  French Growth  French 10-year bonds were little changed after Foreign
Minister  Laurent Fabius  said growth forecasts for 2013 would be
cut to about 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent.  “Things are not going famously well at the European level,
so we will have to lower it,” Fabius said in an interview on
RTL Radio, referring to the government’s 2013 growth forecast
which stands at 0.8 percent.  France’s 10-year yield was at 2.26 percent.  Belgium’s debt agency said yesterday it hired Credit
Agricole SA, HSBC Holdings Plc, ING Groep NV and KBC Groep NV to
sell new benchmark notes due in June 2018.  Belgium’s five-year yield was little changed at 1.19
percent. The nation last sold five-year securities at an average
yield of 0.935 percent in November.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of Italy and Belgium, according to
measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two-year and 10-
year securities and credit-default swaps.  German bunds handed investors a loss of 1.5 percent this
year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish securities returned 2.1 percent and Italian
bonds gained 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
