Standard Bank Group Ltd. , Africa’s
biggest lender, arranged funding for a $126 million desalination
plant in Ghana’s capital that will provide drinking water to
Accra residents.  The seawater desalination project company Befesa Ghana will
provide potable water for about 400,000 Accra residents who have
limited access to clean water, Standard Bank Power and
Infrastructure Finance head George Kotsovos said in an e-mailed
statement.  Abengoa SA  of Spain and  Sojitz Corp.  of Japan are covering
30 percent of the project costs with Standard Bank senior debt
making up the balance, the Johannesburg-based lender said today
in the statement. Ghana is Africa’s second-biggest gold producer
after South Africa and the world’s second-largest cocoa producer
after the Ivory Coast.  “Because of the 12-year term of the project’s debt funding
and lack of mature funding mechanisms in Ghana, the World Bank
had stepped in to perform project feasibility studies and to
provide credit enhancement to underpin the long-term nature of
the funding,” Standard Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
