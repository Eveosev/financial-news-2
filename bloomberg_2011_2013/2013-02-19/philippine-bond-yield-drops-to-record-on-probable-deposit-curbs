Philippine government bonds due 2019
advanced, pushing the yield to a record low, on speculation more
investors will shift money to fixed-income securities from the
central bank’s special-deposit accounts.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor  Amando Tetangco  said
Feb. 15 authorities will rationalize access to these accounts to
keep them as a liquidity management tool and not an investment
outlet. The yield on the six-year notes has fallen 47 basis
points since Jan. 23, the day before the monetary authority cut
the interest rate on SDAs to 3 percent from more than 3.5
percent to curb currency speculation.  “We anticipate further softness in bond yields,” said
 Joey Cuyegkeng , an economist in Manila at ING Groep NV.
“There’s anticipation of further SDA measures in the near term.
Inflation expectations remain quite muted.”  The yield on the government’s 3.875 percent bonds due
November 2019 slid 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to
3.42 percent as of 4:10 p.m. in Manila, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services. That’s the biggest decline since
Feb. 1 and the lowest level since the notes were issued in
November 2012.  Consumer prices rose 3 percent in January from a year
earlier, official data show. The central bank expects inflation
will stay between 3 percent and 5 percent until 2015, which will
provide support for credit and liquidity growth, Deputy Governor
 Diwa Guinigundo  said at a media briefing in Manila on Feb. 13.  The peso was little changed at 40.632 per dollar, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency has advanced 1.1 percent
this year, the second-best performance among Asia’s 11 most-
active currencies. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, held
at 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
