Hog futures fell to a three-month
low on signs that supplies of U.S. hogs are more than sufficient
as demand weakens. Cattle prices also declined.  Meatpackers processed 2.145 million hogs last week, up 0.3
percent from a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Spot  hogs  fell 4.7 percent last week to 81.28 cents a
pound, the biggest drop since Nov. 16, and wholesale  pork 
slumped 2.1 percent, the second straight decline, government
data show.  “Hog numbers, at least coming to market, are still being
adequate,”   Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis, said in a telephone
interview. Cash-market prices are “in a free-fall status for
the short term,” he said.  Hog futures for April settlement declined 1.3 percent to
83.2 cents a pound at 10:37 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after touching 83 cents, the lowest for the most-
active contract since Nov. 12.  Hogs may bottom short-term if a winter storm disrupts
supplies, Schultz said.  Hedge funds lowered net-long  positions  in hogs by 21
percent to 33,986 contracts in the week ended Feb. 12, the
biggest drop since Nov. 6, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show.  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$1.2975 a pound in Chicago. A close at that price would be the
biggest retreat for the most-active contract since Feb. 8.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement slid 0.3 percent
to $1.42925 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
