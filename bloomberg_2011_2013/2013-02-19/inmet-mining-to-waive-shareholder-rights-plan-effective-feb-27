 Inmet Mining Corp., which is trying
to fend off a hostile takeover bid from First Quantum Minerals
Ltd., said it will waive its shareholder rights plan.  The waiving of the plan will be effective Feb. 27, the same
date as First Quantum’s offer expires, Toronto-based Inmet said
today in a statement.  Inmet said it took the decision because the bid’s expiry
date “provides sufficient time for the full review and
potential execution of all strategic alternatives being
evaluated by the Inmet board and its special committee.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
