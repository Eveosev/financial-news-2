RDA Holding Co., publisher of
Reader’s Digest magazine, won interim court approval to borrow
$11 million while it restructures in bankruptcy.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Robert Drain  approved the interim
financing at a hearing today in White Plains, New York. The
company will return to court to seek approval of the remainder
of the $45 million loan arranged by Wells Fargo Principal
Lending LLC as administrative agent.  The company filed for bankruptcy protection Feb. 17 after
reaching an accord with its secured lender and more than
70 percent of its secured noteholders. Under the restructuring
agreement, RDA will convert $465 million of remaining senior
notes to equity.  Reader’s Digest, founded by  DeWitt and Lila Wallace , went
public in 1990. An investor group led by private-equity firm
Ripplewood Holdings LLC bought it in 2007 for $1.6 billion and
the assumption of about $800 million in debt. The company also
filed for bankruptcy in August 2009, citing a drop in
advertising spending and the debt load incurred in its
acquisition.  The case is In re RDA Holding Co. Inc., 13-22233, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (White Plains).
