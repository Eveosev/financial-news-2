Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff
today announced expansion of a program that she said will bring
an additional 2.5 million people out of extreme poverty. The
changes will cost 773 million reais ($396 million) this year.  Under the program, families with monthly incomes of less
than 70 reais per capita will receive a cash payment that will
bring them to that level. Under the old rules, only families
with children under 15 were eligible for the payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
