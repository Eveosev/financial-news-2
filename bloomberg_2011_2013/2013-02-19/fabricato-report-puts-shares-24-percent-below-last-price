Fabricato SA , a Colombian textile
maker, published a report today stating that its shares have a
value at least 24 percent below the last price in November, when
trading was suspended.  Regulators had required Medellin-based  Fabricato  to hire an
independent firm to estimate the stock’s value as a condition
for trading to resume. Now that the  report  is out, the shares
can start trading on March 1, Colombia’s financial regulator
said today in an e-mail.  The stock was suspended after it fell 21 percent on Nov.
16, the biggest drop in fifteen years. The company had become
the target of a control bid by an activist investor group
financed by  Interbolsa SA , according to Pablo Munoz, the
Colombian official overseeing the liquidation of the financial
firm.  Bogota-based Interbolsa was seized by the government after
its brokerage firm, formerly the country’s largest, collapsed
last year.  The shares have a value of 35 to 55 pesos each, according
to the report by the Medellin-based investment bank  SBI Banca de
Inversion SA . SBI’s valuation doesn’t include any premium
investors might assign to the company as a potential  takeover 
target, according to the report.  The stock last  changed hands  at 72 pesos before trading was
suspended in November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fabricato told the investment bank that it isn’t currently
in talks for a possible sale, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
