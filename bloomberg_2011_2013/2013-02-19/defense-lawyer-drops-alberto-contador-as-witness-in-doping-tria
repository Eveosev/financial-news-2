Alberto Contador  won’t have to
testify in a doping trial after the defense attorney who called
him retracted a request that the two-time Tour de France
champion appear in court in three days.  Ignacio Arroyo, the lawyer for Contador’s former team
manager  Manolo Saiz , told the so-called “Operacion Puerto”
trial in Madrid today that he no longer needs the 2007 and 2009
Tour winner to testify.  “As the case proceeds, I make decisions,” Arroyo told
reporters outside the courtroom. “I don’t need him during the
court case.”  He said he had not spoken to Contador or Saiz prior to his
decision.  Saiz, who was Contador’s manager on the Liberty Seguros
team, is among five defendants standing trial in Madrid charged
with a “crime against public health.” The trial is scheduled
to end March 22.  In 2006, police uncovered more than 200 blood bags,
transfusion equipment and drugs in raids on apartments in
Madrid. Cyclists have been known to collect and later transfuse
their own blood to increase their body’s volume of oxygen-
carrying red blood cells that boost stamina.  Contador, whose initials A.C. were found on a training
schedule by police, has said he had nothing to do with the ring.
He was cleared to return to racing about two months after the
raids. Contador was stripped of his 2010 Tour de France title
after failing a drugs test.  To contact the reporters on this story:
