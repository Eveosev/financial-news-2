Vicat SA , a French cement maker, is
cutting spending on maintenance and other costs at its domestic
plants as it seeks to hold onto market share when construction
demand rebounds in 2014 or 2015.  “Year-to-date, Vicat’s deliveries in France are about flat
versus last year, when February was a disaster because of the
cold weather,” Vicat Chief Operating Officer  Raoul de Parisot 
said in a Feb. 12 interview. “We’re expecting French cement
consumption to decline by 5 percent to 7 percent this year,
because housing starts have dropped very sharply.”  “We don’t have any plan to close plants but we’re reducing
costs and maintenance expenditure,” the COO of the company
based in La Defense near Paris also said. “We need our
production capacities to maintain market share when demand picks
up, probably not in 2013 and maybe not in 2014, but hopefully in
2015.”  The move contrasts with peers Lafarge SA and Holcim, which
have both announced they will close a cement plant in France to
reduce overcapacity arising from a building slump exacerbated by
increased imports from countries like Turkey.  Production Capacity  Cement demand in France will fall by about 9 percent this
year after dropping 6.7 percent to 20 million tons in 2012, when
imports rose 5.2 percent to 2 million tons, the French
federation of cement makers said Feb. 11. The combined
production capacity in France of its members  Lafarge , Holcim,
Vicat, Kerneos and Italcementi Spa’s Calcia, amounts to 27.5
million tons, according to the federation.  “In France, the rate use of Vicat’s plant ranges from a
bit less than 60 percent to 70 percent,” the Vicat COO said. He
urged operators of French ports to limit their capacity to
import cement and clinker from countries with looser social and
environmental rules, saying it’s threatening jobs in France.  Vicat said on Feb. 5 that sales in France fell 6.3 percent
last year to 879 million euros ($1.17 billion), representing 38
percent of the group’s 2012 revenue. Total sales rose 1.2
percent.  At 452 million euros, the average  estimate  for Vicat’s 2012
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
is “probably slightly too high,” Stephane Bisseuil, an
investor relations officer at Vicat, said on a Feb. 6 conference
call with analysts. “Regarding 2013, at this stage we are I
would say happy with the current consensus.”  Vicat shares closed up 0.1 percent at 46 euros in Paris,
paring this year’s loss to 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
