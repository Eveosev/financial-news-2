Foreign investors in December
 reduced  their holdings of Canadian securities for the first time
since June, as they received payment of matured bonds and sold
equities, government figures showed.  Net sales totaled C$1.92 billion ($1.89 billion) in the
month, following Novemberâ€™s revised purchase of C$5.5 billion,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. For the year, foreign
investors bought a net C$83.2 billion of Canadian securities,
the lowest since 2008 and down from C$97.3 billion in 2011.  Equity holdings fell a net C$6.68 billion during the month,
while bond holdings by non-residents was down a net C$655
million. Retirement of bonds issued by the federal government
and state businesses offset purchases in the secondary market,
the agency said.  Non-residents purchased C$5.42 billion of money-market
paper.  Canadians bought a net C$5.47 billion of foreign securities
in December, the statistics agency said, led by purchases of
bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
