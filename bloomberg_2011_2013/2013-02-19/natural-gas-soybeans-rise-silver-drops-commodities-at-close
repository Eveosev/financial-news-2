in New York. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  declined
0.4 percent to 1,592.063.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures rose in New York by the most in more
than five weeks on speculation that colder weather across the
U.S. in early March will spur fuel use.  Gas climbed 3.8 percent, the biggest percentage gain since

predicted below-normal temperatures for most of the lower 48

East next week. A gas surplus to the five-year average has
widened since the end of November as mild weather crimped demand
