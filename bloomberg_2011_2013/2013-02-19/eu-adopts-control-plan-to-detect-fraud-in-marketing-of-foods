The European Union recommended a
plan to investigate fraudulent food-marketing practices in a bid
to restore consumer confidence following the mislabelling of
beef products containing horse meat.  The plan’s controls are to run for one month, after which
they may be extended for a further two months, the European
Commission, the EU’s Brussels-based executive, said today in an
e-mailed statement. The EU will fund 75 percent of the cost of
the program, according to the statement.  Retailers across the region have withdrawn frozen meat
products after they were shown to contain horse DNA. The scandal
has led policy makers to urge the industry to make the food
chain less opaque.  Under the EU’s plan, controls will be set up, mainly at
retail level, for foods marketed to consumers as containing beef
to detect the presence of unlabelled horse meat. Tests also will
be carried out for possible residue of in horse meat of
phenylbutazone, a potentially harmful veterinary drug known as
bute.  The plan foresees testing of total of 2,250 beef samples
across the EU, ranging from 10 to 150 per member state.
To test for bute, the program prescribes the testing of one
sample for every 50 tons of horse meat, with each nation
carrying out at least five tests, according to the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
