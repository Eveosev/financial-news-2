EOG Resources Inc.  and other
drillers increased production in Texas’s Eagle Ford shale
formation by 68 percent in December compared with the same
period a year earlier.  The nine geographic fields that make up the majority of the
play yielded 384,964 barrels of crude a day, according to
preliminary data released yesterday by the  Texas Railroad
Commission , which oversees oil and gas drilling in the state.
Preliminary daily output in November was 358,826 barrels, the
commission reported last month.  In December 2011, the fields yielded 229,269 barrels a day.  Production of condensates, or natural gas liquids, was
52,781 barrels a day in December, down from 97,475 the previous
year, as drillers have tried to move away from less profitable
gas plays.  Railroad Commission production totals typically increase as
the state receives revised, corrected or late reports. For
example, November output was increased to 393,981 barrels a day
in this month’s report.  EOG is the largest leaseholder in the Eagle Ford play, with
644,000 net acres.  Chesapeake Energy Corp.  is next with 490,000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Growing production out of Eagle Ford is helping fuel a
renaissance in Texas crude. The  state  produced 2.14 million
barrels a day in October, the highest monthly level since
February 1987, according to the U.S. Energy Department’s Energy
Information Administration.  Plains Marketing LP’s  posted price  for Eagle Ford oil today
was $104.87 a barrel, compared with the most recent settlement
prices of $95.86 for West Texas Intermediate and $117.38 for
Brent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
