Group 1 Automotive Inc.  plunged the
most in more than eight months after the auto-dealership group’s
fourth-quarter profit trailed analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  slid 7.5 percent to $61.62 at the close in New
York for the biggest daily decline since June 1. The Houston-
based company’s stock had gained 7.5 percent this year through
Feb. 15, as the Standard & Poor’s 600 Smallcap Index rose
8.4 percent.  Group 1 reported quarterly profit excluding some items of
99 cents a share, less than the $1.19 average of 11 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Net income fell to $17.1 million, or
70 cents a share, from $20.9 million, or 90 cents, a year
earlier, according to a statement today.  “We missed some opportunities to maximize profits,” Chief
Executive Officer  Earl Hesterberg  said in the statement.  The company has been revamping its roster of dealerships,
acquiring 16 in 2012 while selling off six franchises. Group 1
last month agreed to buy a Brazilian dealership group to expand
into that nation’s fast-growing market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
