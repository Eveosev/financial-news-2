German stocks  rose for a second day
as economic sentiment in Europe’s largest economy improved in
February more than analysts had forecast.  BASF AG, the world’s biggest chemical manufacturer, led
gains on the benchmark DAX Index. Bayer AG rose the most in more
than three weeks after saying it has begun new trials on a
blindness treatment with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Pfeiffer
Vacuum Technology AG fell to its lowest in more than two months
after posting earnings that missed estimates.  The  DAX  added 1.6 percent to 7,752.45 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt. The benchmark gauge has risen 1.8 percent
so far this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a budget preventing
spending cuts and tax increases that threatened to push the
world’s biggest economy into recession. The broader HDAX Index
also climbed 1.6 percent today.  “The economic sentiment data was pretty surprisingly
positive,”  Henrik Drusebjerg  a senior strategist at Nordea Bank
AB in Copenhagen, where he helps oversee $220 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “We see improving economic data,
especially from outside Europe. We have an underlying theme of
where else should we put our money, in light of the very low
interest rates. I guess there are no other alternatives to
equities.”  The volume of shares changing hands on the DAX was 4.3
percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investor Confidence  German investor confidence jumped in February to the
highest in almost three years. The ZEW Center for European
Economic Research in Mannheim said its  index  of investor and
analyst expectations, which aims to predict economic
developments six months in advance, climbed to 48.2 from 31.5 in
January. That’s the highest since April 2010. Economists
forecast a gain to 35, according to the median of 38 estimates
in a  Bloomberg News survey .  BASF  gained 3.3 percent to 73.79 euros as a gauge of
chemical companies climbed the most among the 19 industry groups
in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  Bayer  advanced 3.6 percent to 71.79 euros, its biggest gain
since Jan. 25. The drugs and chemicals maker and Regeneron began
a new Phase 3 trial for the Eylea blindness treatment. Bayer
said they have extended their global development program after
promising results in Phase 2.  MTU Aero Engines Holding AG  rose 2.9 percent to 71.08
euros, its biggest gain in five months. Germany’s largest
aircraft engine maker said operating profit jumped 14 percent
last year, beating its forecast, and boosted its outlook for
2013 on surging commercial engine deliveries.  Kloeckner Stake  Kloeckner & Co. SE , Europe’s largest independent steel
trader, added 16 percent to 10.88 euros, its largest increase in
almost four years, as Interfer Holding GmbH bought a 7.82
percent stake.  Interfer owns Kloeckner’s rival Knauf Interfer SE, which is
planning to expand, and said today in a statement that the deal
was a “strategic investment.”  Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology  fell 2.8 percent to 87.58 euros,
its lowest price since Dec. 3. The service-pumps manufacturer
reported earnings before interest and taxes for 2012 of 67.7
million euros ($90.4 million), compared with analysts’ estimates
of 70.1 million euros.  Comdirect Bank AG  lost 3.6 percent to 8.32 euros after the
retail brokerage arm of Commerzbank AG said profit in 2012 fell
34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
