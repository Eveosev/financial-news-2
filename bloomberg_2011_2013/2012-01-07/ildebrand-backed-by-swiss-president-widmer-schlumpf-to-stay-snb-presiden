Swiss central bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand should stay in office as he hasn’t done anything
illegal and helped stabilize the Swiss economy, President
Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said.  “There’s absolutely no reason for us not to trust
Hildebrand,” Widmer-Schlumpf told the SF state broadcaster when
asked whether Hildebrand should resign. The government took
notice of two reports saying the chairman didn’t act against the
law or any central  bank regulations , Widmer-Schlumpf added.  Hildebrand said Jan. 5 he acted appropriately in his role
after reports about improper currency trades in his family led
to calls for his resignation. He expressed regret that he didn’t
curb his wife’s currency trading.  Hildebrand played an important role in stabilizing the
financial situation of  Switzerland , Widmer-Schlumpf told SF
yesterday. He “contributed to the relatively good situation
which we have now in Switzerland despite the strong franc,” she
said.  The Wall Street Journal yesterday reported that the right-
wing  Swiss People’s Party  is isolated in its calls for
Hildebrand to resign. Other parties, including the Social
Democrats and the Green Liberal Party, have pledged to support
him, the newspaper said on its website, citing lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
