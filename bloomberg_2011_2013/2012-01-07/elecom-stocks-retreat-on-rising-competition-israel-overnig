Israeli telecommunication (TACOM)  companies
dropped last week, extending their worst year on record, on
concern revenue will fall after a competitor signed 10,000 new
customers for its cellular services.  Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp. (BEZQ) ,  Israel ’s largest
telecommunications company, dropped 0.2 percent to 6.84 shekels
at 4:30 p.m. in Tel Aviv today after dropping 1.9 percent last
week.  Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL) , the country’s biggest mobile-phone
provider, slumped to the lowest on record in Tel Aviv after
sinking 8.2 percent in  New York  last week. The TA-Com index of
telecommunication companies climbed 1.2 percent last week,
underperforming the Israeli  benchmark TA-25 Index’s (TA-25)  2.6 percent
gain and the 5.2 percent advance posted by the  Bloomberg Israel-
US 25 Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest Israeli companies traded in New York.  The Ministry of Communications, seeking to boost
competition in the market, issued licenses to new mobile
telephone and virtual operators last year at a time when
hundreds of thousands of protesters demonstrated during the
summer calling for lower prices, more affordable housing and
free pre-school education.  “There’s a lot of competition coming to the market,” said
Jean Kaplan, an analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc in  London . “Bezeq
may be catching up” with the cellular companies’ drop, he said.  Bezeq’s decline had pushed  valuations (BEZQ)  to 8.6 times
estimated earnings last week, while Cellcom traded at 6.7 times
2012 earnings, below the benchmark’s level of 10.  Suspending Production  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
to  Switzerland ’s, has about 60 companies traded on the  Nasdaq ,
the most of any country outside the U.S. after  China . It is also
home to the largest number of startup companies per capita in
the world.  Perrigo Co. (PRGO) , the largest U.S. maker of generic over-the-
counter drugs, dropped 1.3 percent in New York to $96.06 last
week after shares in Tel Aviv sank 3.2 percent to 362.20
shekels, or the equivalent of $94. The $2 premium was the
biggest among companies trading in both exchanges. Perrigo
advanced 1.7 percent to 368.30 shekels, or $95.59, in Tel Aviv
today.  Perrigo will benefit from  Novartis AG (NVS) ’s temporarily
suspending production from its Lincoln, Nebraska, plant, Louise Chen, an analyst at Collins Stewart LLC, said in an e-mailed
note last week.  Novartis’ plant supplies over-the-counter drugs including
Excedrin, Theraflu and Triaminic, she wrote. “Perrigo
manufactures all the store brand versions of these products,”
Chen said.  New Competition  Shares of Cellcom fell to $15.51 in New York on Jan. 6. The
shares dropped 1.8 percent to 60.60 shekels in  Tel Aviv  where
shares were trading without the right to receive a 1.90 shekel-
a-share dividend payable on January 19.  “This is a continuation of a negative trend in local
telecommunication companies on the back of regulatory
uncertainty,” said Uriel Goren, head of international clients
desk at DS Securities & Investments Ltd.  The New York shares of Cellcom dropped 48 percent in 2011,
the most since the company listed shares in New York in 2007.
Bezeq’s stock sank 35 percent in 2011, the most since its 1995
initial public offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.  The TA-Com index of telecommunication companies lost 1.1
percent, while the TA-25 gained 0.1 percent today.  Rami Levi Chain Stores Hashikma Marketing 2006 Ltd. (RMLI) , an
Israeli supermarket operator, said last week that it signed
10,000 customers since starting its cellular service last month.  Alon Holdings Blue Square Israel Ltd. (BSI) , Israel’s second-
largest supermarket operator, signed in December a three-year
agreement with  Partner Communications Co. (PTNR)  to offer mobile-phone
services on Partner’s network.  Bezeq, which offers fixed-line, Internet and mobile
services, said on Nov. 9 that  third-quarter profit (BEZQ)  fell 6.5
percent as its cellular-phone unit, facing growing competition,
lowered rates on regulator instructions and increased its debt.  “Bezeq has come out quite better than Partner and Cellcom
because it has more segments than them,” HSBC’s Kaplan said.  Prolor Gains  Prolor Biotech Inc. (PBTH)  led gains among Israeli companies
traded in New York last week, jumping 21 percent to $5.15 after
the Tel Aviv shares advanced 20 percent to 19 shekels, or the
equivalent of $4.93. The stock jumped 6.4 percent to 20.22
shekels, or $5.25, in Tel Aviv today.  The company that uses proteins to improve existing
treatments, such as in growth hormone therapy, is rising on the
back of “greater confidence in multiple clinical catalysts,”
said Raghuram Selvaraju, an equity analyst at Morgan Joseph
TriArtisan Group in New York.  Prolor, which shares Chairman Philip Frost with  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , may be “a great fit” as an
acquisition target after Jeremy Levin assumes his new position
as chief executive officer, Selvaraju said.  The shekel fell 1.1 percent versus the dollar last week to
3.8528 per dollar, extending its 7.5 percent drop in 2011, the
worst annual decline since 2001.  Details on 6,050 Israeli credit card holders have been
posted on the Internet by a hacker identifying himself as a
Saudi, Globes reported on Jan. 6, citing credit card companies.  Last week, details from 15,000 Israeli credit card
customers were exposed by hackers on the Internet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
