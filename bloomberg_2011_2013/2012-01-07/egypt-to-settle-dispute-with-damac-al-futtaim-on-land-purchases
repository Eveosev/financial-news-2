(Corrects first paragraph of story published yesterday to
show that one of the companies is the Al-Futtaim Group, not the
Majid Al Futtaim Group as originally reported.)  An Egyptian government commission
approved the settlement of disputes with Dubaiâ€™s Damac
Properties Co. and Al-Futtaim Group, according to Fayza Aboulnaga, minister of planning and international cooperation.  The initial agreement will be submitted for government
approval in the new week, she told reporters in Cairo today. The
deal provides for the two companies to fund the difference
between prices they had paid for land in contracts with the
previous administration of ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  and
the value deemed fair by the current authorities, she said.  The Egyptian government is trying to settle disputes with
companies over contracts signed with the Mubarak administration
in out-of-court reconciliations. Damac had filed an arbitration
lawsuit in  Washington  in May against  Egypt  after the government
seized land purchased in 2006 and sentenced its chairman to five
years of hard labor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
