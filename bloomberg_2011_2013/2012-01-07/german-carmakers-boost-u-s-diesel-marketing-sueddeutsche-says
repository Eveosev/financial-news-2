German carmakers including  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ,  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi will start
a new marketing offensive for diesel-fuelled vehicles in the
U.S.,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing Matthias Wissmann,
head of Germany’s VDA auto-industry association.  The initiative, which will focus on “common communication
and clear messages” rather than joint commercials, will
coincide with the start of the Detroit Motor Show next week, the
newspaper cited Wissmann as saying. While Diesel cars make up
almost half of all cars in Europe, that share is only 2 percent
in the U.S., according to Sueddeutsche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
