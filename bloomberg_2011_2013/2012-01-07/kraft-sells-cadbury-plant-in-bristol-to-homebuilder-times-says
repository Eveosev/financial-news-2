Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  has agreed to sell
Cadbury’s Somerdale plant in Bristol,  England , to homebuilder
 Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  for 35 million pounds ($54 million), the Times
of London reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  Kraft initially pledged to keep the factory open when it
acquired Cadbury Plc less than two years ago and then reversed
this commitment, transferring production to  Poland  and putting
the site on sale, the newspaper said.  Kraft will inform residents and all other parties when it’s
ready to make an announcement, the newspaper cited the company
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
