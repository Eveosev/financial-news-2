Jan Hatzius, chief economist for
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to
initiate an additional program to buy bonds in order to help
stabilize real-estate prices,  Euro am Sonntag  reported, citing
an interview.  The central bank will probably purchase $70 billion to $100
billion worth of bonds, including mortgage-backed obligations,
in several stages, the newspaper said, citing Hatzius.  To contact the reporter on this story:
