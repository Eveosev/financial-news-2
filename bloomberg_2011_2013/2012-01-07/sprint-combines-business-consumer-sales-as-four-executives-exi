Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  combined sales
and marketing for its business and consumer divisions, placing
them under managers from the business side, and announced the
departure of four executives.  The third-largest U.S. wireless-phone service named Paget Alves, president of business markets, as its new chief sales
officer, according to a company memo outlining the changes. Bill
Malloy was promoted to chief marketing officer, responsible for
both consumer and business markets.  “As the wireless market has evolved, the lines between
consumers and businesses have blurred,” Sprint Chief Executive
Officer  Dan Hesse  said in the memo. “We believe that we no
longer need to support two separate business units (consumer and
business), and that it is more logical now to evolve to unified
marketing and sales organizations.”  As a result of the reorganization, Robert H. Johnson, Danny Bowman,  John Carney  and Chris Rogers will leave the company,
spokesman  Scott Sloat  said in an interview. The news was first
reported by Reuters.  Johnson was president of Sprint’s consumer unit, while
Bowman was president of the Integrated Solutions Group, which
works with business and public-sector customers. Carney ran
Sprint’s consumer marketing, and Rogers was responsible for
corporate development and spectrum.  “What we are doing is just simplifying the business,”
Sloat said. “We are not planning on major closings or job
reductions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
