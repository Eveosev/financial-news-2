France ’s shareholding agency head
Jean-Dominique Comolli rejected  Dexia SA (DEXB)  Chief Executive Officer
Pierre Mariani’s proposal during a Jan. 6 meeting that the
government nationalize the lender’s French units Dexia Credit
Local and Dexma,  Le Figaro  reported today, citing an
unidentified participant at the meeting.  Nationalizing French units of the Franco-Belgian municipal
lender is one of the possible solutions, said Michel Bouvard,
chairman of the supervisory board of Caisse des Depots et
Consignations, according to the French newspaper.  Conditions for a plan agreed in October in which Caisse des
Depots was to take 65 percent of Dexia’s French municipal
business aren’t there anymore, Bouvard said, according to Le
Figaro. In the current depressed economic environment, Dexma’s
takeover would cost Caisse des Depots about 2 billion euros
($2.54 billion) of shareholders equity, which would lead to
“very stretched” financial ratios, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
