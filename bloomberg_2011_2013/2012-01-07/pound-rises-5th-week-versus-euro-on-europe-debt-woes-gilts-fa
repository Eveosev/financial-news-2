The pound rose for a fifth week
against the euro as signs the European debt crisis is worsening
spurred demand for the relative safety of the U.K. currency.  Sterling climbed to the strongest in 15 months versus the
single currency after French borrowing costs increased at an
auction this week and reports showed European economic
confidence and German factory orders declined. Ten-year gilts
completed the first weekly loss since November as yields near a
record low damped demand for the securities.  “The pound might strengthen towards 80 pence per euro at
some point in the next few weeks, and that’s not because the
U.K. is wonderful,” said Kit Juckes, head of currency research
at Society Generale SA in  London . “We have a sense that the
measures that would bring the euro crisis to an end could be put
in place with one summit over one weekend, but that’s true for
six months and it hasn’t happened.”  The pound appreciated 1 percent this week to 82.48 pence
per euro at 4:55 p.m. in London yesterday after rising to 82.39
pence, the strongest level since Sept. 10, 2010. The five-week
gain is the longest since June 2009. Sterling fell 0.7 percent
this week to $1.5430, and dropped 0.5 percent to 118.91 yen.  France  sold 4.02 billion euros of the bonds maturing in
October 2021 at an average yield of 3.29 percent on Jan. 5, up
from 3.18 percent on Dec. 1. The nation has the biggest debt
burden of the six top-rated euro nations, at 85 percent of gross
domestic product.  Europe’s Slowdown  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area fell to 93.3 in December, the European
Commission in Brussels said yesterday. Factory orders in
 Germany , the region’s largest economy, dropped 4.8 percent in
November, the most in almost three years, according to the
Economy Ministry in Berlin.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  will meet German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  on Jan. 9 in Berlin to discuss the
region’s debt crisis after he hosted Italian Prime Minister
 Mario Monti  on Jan. 6.  Sterling has risen 2.9 percent in the past six months
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. Only the yen and dollar have
risen more. The euro tumbled 5.2 percent during the same period.  Gilts Drop  Ten-year gilts fell for the first time in six weeks after
U.K. government debt returned 17 percent on average in 2011,
including reinvested interest, the most among 26 government
markets tracked by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  The 10-year yield climbed four basis points this week to
2.02 percent after falling to a record 1.93 percent on Dec. 30.
Two-year yields increased seven basis points to 0.4 percent.  The sell-off in gilts is likely to be short-lived as the
European crisis drives demand for AAA rated U.K. government
bonds, said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in London.  Overseas investors boosted their gilt holdings by 16.3
billion pounds in November, the most since September 2008,
according to  Bank of England  data released Jan. 4.  “The situation in the euro region has not fundamentally
changed,” Wraith said. “I don’t think the bullish trend for
gilts is over.”  The Bank of England will keep its  benchmark interest (UKBRBASE)  rate
unchanged at 0.50 percent when policy makers meet on Jan. 12,
according to all 53 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
