 White House press secretary  Eric
Schultz  said a new book about the Obama family that describes
clashes between first lady  Michelle Obama  and top aides is “an
over dramatization of old news.”  The book’s author, Jodi Kantor, wrote an adaptation of
“The Obamas” that was published in today’s New York Times. The
story said Michelle Obama has been influential in President
Barack Obama’s administration and has criticized the work of top
aides including former Chief of Staff  Rahm Emanuel  and former
Press Secretary  Robert Gibbs .  The story, which Kantor said was based on interviews with
more than 30 current or former aides for the book, as well as
close friends of the Obamas, also said the first lady at one
time considered remaining in  Chicago  with her two daughters for
several months after her husband’s inauguration and has
sometimes shunned the spotlight more than Obama’s political
aides would have liked.  Schultz called the book “the author’s take, reflecting her
own opinions” and said Kantor hasn’t spoken with the Obamas in
years.  “The emotions, thoughts and private moments described in
the book, though often seemingly ascribed to the president and
first lady, reflect little more than the author’s own
thoughts,” Schultz said in an e-mail. “These second-hand
accounts are staples of every administration in modern political
history and often exaggerated.”  Citing anonymous aides, the Times story reported that
Barack Obama told White House staff, following Democrats’ loss
of Senator Edward Kennedy’s Massachusetts Senate seat in January
2010, that his wife thought the administration was off course.  To contact the reporter on this story:
