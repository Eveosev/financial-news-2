Poland’s budget deficit totaled about
25 billion zloty ($7.1 billion) in 2011, about one third below
the government’s target, Finance Minister  Jacek Rostowski  said
in a letter to the European Commission,  Gazeta Wyborcza  reported
today.  Poland will narrow this year’s general government shortfall
by 2.63 percentage points to 2.97 percent of gross domestic
product, the daily newspaper said, citing the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
