Manchester United said a newspaper
report that  Wayne Rooney  will leave the English soccer team is
“complete nonsense.”  An argument between Rooney and manager  Alex Ferguson  in
late December has damaged the pair’s working relationship and
may lead to the 26-year-old player being sold this month,
according to a  report  in the Independent, published today and
citing an unidentified source.  “Any suggestion that Manchester United and Wayne Rooney
are to part company is complete nonsense,” United said in a
 statement  on the club’s website. “The player and the manager
have always had and retain the utmost respect for each other and
look forward to working together in the coming seasons.”  In a separate statement, posted on  Twitter , Rooney said the
newspaper report was “rubbish.”  “My future is with  Manchester United  and the club and I am
totally committed; the manager and I have no issues and anyone
who says different doesn’t know what they are talking about.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
