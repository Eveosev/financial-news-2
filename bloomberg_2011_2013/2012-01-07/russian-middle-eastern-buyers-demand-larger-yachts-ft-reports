Luxury European-made motoryachts are
getting longer, driven by demand from Middle Eastern and Russian
buyers, the Financial Times reported, citing  superyachts.com , a
website for buying yachts.  Eleven new vessels will enter the websiteâ€™s top 100 ranking
by length this year, compared with nine a year earlier, the
newspaper reported.  The largest new entry is Topaz, a 147-meter (482 feet)
yacht built by Bremen-Vegesack, Germany-based Luerssen Yachts,
the FT said. Topaz will be as big as the fourth-biggest vessel
so far, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
