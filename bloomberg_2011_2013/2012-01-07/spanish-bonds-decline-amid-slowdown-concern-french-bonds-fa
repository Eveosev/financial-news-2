Spanish 10-year yields rose by the
most in almost 17 years, leading the bonds of the euro region’s
most-indebted countries lower, on concern that they will
struggle to cut budget deficits amid the economic slowdown.  French bonds declined for a second week after borrowing
costs climbed at debt sales. Italian securities also dropped as
a report showed  European confidence (EUESEMU)  in the economic outlook fell
to a two-year low in December. German 10-year bunds declined as
the Commerce Department said the U.S. added more jobs than
predicted by economists, adding to evidence the world’s largest
economy may avoid a recession.  Spain ,  Italy , the Netherlands,
Austria and  Germany  plan to sell bonds next week.  “Market participants have remained in risk-averse mood
this week,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “Long-
term yields continue to trend lower as growth expectations fall,
and long-term peripheral spreads remain under widening pressure
due to the heavy supply slate.”  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds climbed to 5.71 percent,
up 62 basis points from the end of last week. That’s the biggest
rise since the five days ending Aug. 12, 1994, when yields
climbed 63 basis points.  French 10-year yields rose 22 basis points, or 0.22
percentage point, to 3.36 percent, as of 4:58 p.m.  London  time
yesterday, increasing for eight consecutive days, the longest
run since June 2006.  France  sold 7.96 billion euros ($10.1
billion) of debt on Jan. 5, with 10-year borrowing costs rising
to 3.29 percent from 3.18 percent at the country’s first bond
auction of the year as credit-rating companies threaten to cut
the nation’s AAA grade.  Impending Bond Sales  Spain is scheduled to sell notes maturing in 2015 and 2016
on Jan. 12, while Italy auctions bonds and floating-rate notes
the following day. Germany will offer 5 billion euros of five-
year notes on Jan. 9. The Netherlands is due to issue up to 3.5
billion euros of 2015 notes on Jan. 10, the same day  Austria 
auctions 2022 bonds.  Austrian 10-year  yields (GAGB10YR)  surged 59 basis points, rising
above 3.5 percent for the first time since Dec. 1, on concern
the nation’s banks will lose money on loans to  Hungary .  “Issues in Hungary where the country failed to fully issue
bonds rippled into the euro zone, especially Austria, whose
banks are heavily exposed to the Hungarian mortgage market,”
Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and institutional
treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in London, wrote in a Jan. 6
note to investors.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area fell to 93.3 in December from a revised 93.8
the previous month, the European Commission in Brussels said
yesterday.  The  European Central Bank  will keep its main  interest rate (EURR002W) 
at a record low 1 percent on Jan. 12, according to all but three
of 51 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
