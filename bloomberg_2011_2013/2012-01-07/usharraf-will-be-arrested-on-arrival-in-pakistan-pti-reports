Pervez Musharraf , who resigned as
 Pakistan ’s president in 2008, will be arrested on arrival in the
country later this month, the Press Trust of India reported,
citing a prosecutor.  Musharraf is a “proclaimed offender” and there’s no need
for a warrant for this arrest, PTI reported today, citing
Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali, prosecutor at the Federal Investigation
Agency. Musharraf lives in Dubai and  London  and plans to return
to Pakistan on Jan. 25 or Jan. 27, according to the report.  A Pakistani court issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf in
February over allegations he played a role in the 2007
assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, the AP
reported at the time, citing prosecutors. He hadn’t been charged
in the case, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
