Unilever Plc (ULVR) ’s British factory
workers will resume strikes this month to protest proposed cuts
to the company’s final-salary pension program, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported on its  website , citing labor unions.  GMB, Unite and Usdaw called for 24-hour strikes from Jan.
17 to follow last month’s actions, in which they said 2,500 of
the company’s employees participated, the  BBC  said.  Unilever is “deeply concerned by the disproportionate
action the trade unions are taking” and it’s not clear how the
dispute will be resolved, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
