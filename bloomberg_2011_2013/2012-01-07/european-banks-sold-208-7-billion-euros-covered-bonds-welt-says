The volume of bonds that banks in
 Greece , Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland have issued so far
and that are only guaranteed by their home states amounts to
208.7 billion euros ($265.4 billion),  Welt am Sonntag  reported,
citing its own research.  The banks have made “brisk” use of the option to deposit
those bonds as collateral at the  European Central Bank , the
newspaper cited several unidentified central bankers as saying,
without specifying a figure.  The central bankers said the ECB may at any time limit the
acceptance of such covered bonds, Welt am Sonntag said, adding
that the ECB declined to comment when and how such rules may be
introduced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
