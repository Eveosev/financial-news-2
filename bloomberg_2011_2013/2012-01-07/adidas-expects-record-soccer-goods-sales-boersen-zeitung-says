Adidas AG (ADS)  expects to lift sales of
soccer products this year to more than the record 1.5 billion
euros ($1.9 billion) posted in 2010 as the European cup boosts
demand, Chief Financial Officer Robin Stalker told  Boersen-
Zeitung  in an interview.  Adidas is very content with business at the end of 2011 and
the sporting-goods industry will probably exceed growth in other
 consumer goods  because it targets younger buyers, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
