Russia’s foreign ministry has
expressed concern at calls for former Egyptian president  Hosni Mubarak  to face the death penalty for his role in the killing of
protesters who joined rallies that led to his ouster.  “These reports are received with concern in Moscow,” the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement. “We’re talking about a
man of very old age, who is 83 and reportedly seriously ill.”  The prosecution asked for the death penalty yesterday
during proceedings in Cairo, the official Middle East News
Agency said. Mubarak has denied charges of complicity to kill
demonstrators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
