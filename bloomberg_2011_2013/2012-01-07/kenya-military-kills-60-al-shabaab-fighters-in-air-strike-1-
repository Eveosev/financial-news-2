Kenya’s military has pushed the al-
Shabaab militia group from a 95,000 square-kilometer area of
Somalia and secured 860 kilometers (534 miles) of the two
nations’ common border, said Cyrus Oguna, a spokesman for the
Kenya Defence Forces said.  The secured zone stretches about 110 kilometers into
Somalia, Oguna told reporters today in the Kenyan capital,
Nairobi. Ten Kenyan soldiers have been killed in direct combat,
five in a helicopter crash, 10 are nursing injuries in hospital
while one is missing at sea, he said, declining to give the
number of al-Shabaab casualties.  Kenyan soldiers entered Somali territory in October to
battle the al-Shabaab, a group linked to al-Qaeda that has waged
a four-year campaign to remove the Western-backed transitional
government of President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. The military
campaign started after Kenya accused al-Shabaab of murdering a
British tourist at a luxury resort and other attacks on
holidaymakers and aid workers.  Another 30 Kenyan civilians have been killed in al-Shabaab
retaliatory attacks inside the east African nation, Police
spokesman  Eric Kiraithe  said during the briefing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
