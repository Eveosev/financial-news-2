The state-owned  Zimbabwe  Mining
Development Corp. has taken control of Sino-Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd.,
a miner in Zimbabweâ€™s eastern Marange diamond fields, the Herald
said, citing ZMDC Chairman Goodwills Masimirembwa.  The Chinese gem miner stopped operations last year, saying
the area it had a license to mine lacked diamonds, the Harare-
based, state-controlled Herald said on its website. ZMDC is
recruiting other miners and carrying out further exploration to
continue operations, the Herald quoted Masimirembwa as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
