Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
named Henry Rangel Silva, who vowed not to cooperate with the
opposition should they take power, to the post of Defense
Minister, replacing Carlos Mata Figueroa.  “I’ve called him here because he’s a humble man, a fighter
for the people,” Chavez said in comments from a Catholic Mass
broadcast on state television.  Chavez promoted Rangel Silva to General-in-Chief in 2010
after he told the  Ultimas Noticias  newspaper that the military
wouldn’t tolerate an opposition government because it would try
to “sell” the country.  Chavez, a former paratrooper who has led  South America ’s
largest oil producer since 1999 and will seek a third
consecutive six-year term in October elections, said he’ll
replace cabinet members early this year including Foreign
Minister Nicolas Maduro and Vice President Elias Jaua.  The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Rangel Silva and
two other officials in 2008 for allegedly assisting narcotics
trafficking by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia , or
FARC.  Maduro and Jaua will run for governor of Carabobo and
Miranda states, respectively, in December regional elections.
Chavez has said Mata Figueroa will run for governor of Nueva
Esparta state.  Diosdado Cabello, a close confidant of Chavez and head of
his PSUV political party, was sworn in yesterday as the
president of the National Assembly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
