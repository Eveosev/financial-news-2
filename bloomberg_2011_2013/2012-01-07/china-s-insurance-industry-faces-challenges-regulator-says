China’s insurance industry faces
greater challenges in 2012 and insurers should seek ways to
boost their capital, said  Xiang Junbo , chairman of the country’s
Insurance Regulatory Commission.  Insurance companies faced difficult conditions last year
when the annualized return on investment dropped to 3.6 percent,
Xiang said in a statement today on the commission’s website.  “Affected by severe external economic and financial
conditions as well as the sector’s own problems, the industry is
experiencing a rapid increase in difficulties,” Xiang said.  The commission is encouraging companies to find ways to
boost their capital with a focus on issuance of subordinated,
convertible and hybrid bonds, Xiang said in a separate
statement.  Xiang, who was appointed in October, said his agency
supports plans for the  People’s Insurance Company (Group) of
China Ltd. (PICCZ)  to become a public company and will push forward
reform of shareholding arrangements at the  China Life Insurance
Group Co. (CLIGCZ)   --Michael Wei, Editors:  John Deane , Rachel Graham  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
