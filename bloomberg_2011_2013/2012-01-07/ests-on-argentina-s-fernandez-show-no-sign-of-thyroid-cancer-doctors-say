Doctors treating  Argentina ’s
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said she didn’t have
cancer after medical tests on tumors in her thyroid gland showed
no signs of cancerous cells.  Fernandez, 58, was released from Austral University
Hospital today after undergoing surgery Jan. 4, presidential
spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said in comments broadcast on
television station C5N. He said Fernandez had tumors on her
thyroid gland removed along with the thyroid, and a biopsy
didn’t find any malignant cells.  Doctors “ruled out the presence of cancerous cells,
modifying the original diagnosis” of thyroid cancer,
Scoccimarro said. “The surgical treatment performed is
sufficient” and no further treatment is necessary, he said.  The president will travel to Olivos where she will remain
on medical leave until Jan. 24, the government said in a
statement published on the president’s website.  The announcement was greeted by cheers from supporters
outside the hospital, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from  Buenos
Aires . Fernandez began her second four-year term on Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
