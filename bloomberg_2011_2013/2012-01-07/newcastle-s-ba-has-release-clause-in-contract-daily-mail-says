Demba Ba, the Premier League’s
second-leading scorer, has a $10 million-pound ($15 million)
release clause in his contract with Newcastle, the  Daily Mail 
said.  Ba has scored 15 goals this season, two less than league
leader  Robin van Persie  of Arseanl. The clause is part of the
three-year contract worth 40,000 pounds per week he signed in
joining Newcastle from West Ham in the summer.  Newcastle has no intention of selling the Senegal striker,
who recently left for the African Cup of Nations. Ba had a
similar clause in his contract when he joined West Ham last
January from Hoffenheim and exercised it when the Hammers were
relegated to the second-tier Championship.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
