Morgan Stanley (MS) , the bank that
underwrote the initial public offerings of Zynga Inc. and
LinkedIn Corp. last year, bought shares of both social-media
companies in the fourth quarter.  The New York-based firm now owns 15.7 million Zynga shares
and increased its LinkedIn stake by 81 percent to 3.98 million
shares, according to separate filings today. Zynga held its IPO
last month, while LinkedIn went public in May.  As part of its underwriting agreements with the companies,
Morgan Stanley agreed to buy shares in each of the offerings.
The bank also managed the IPOs of music-streaming service
Pandora Media Inc., vacation-rental site HomeAway Inc. and
daily-deal provider Groupon Inc.  Morgan Stanley’s stake in Zynga, a social-gaming company,
is worth about $138 million based on today’s closing  price (ZNGA)  of
$8.81. According to the prospectus, Morgan Stanley agreed to buy
the stock at the IPO price of $10 a share, so the shares have
lost about 12 percent of their value.  Morgan Stanley’s LinkedIn stake is worth $255.5 million.
Morgan Stanley didn’t say how much it paid for the 1.78 million
shares it purchased most recently.  LinkedIn (LNKD) , the world’s biggest
professional-networking website, has gained 43 percent since its
IPO in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
