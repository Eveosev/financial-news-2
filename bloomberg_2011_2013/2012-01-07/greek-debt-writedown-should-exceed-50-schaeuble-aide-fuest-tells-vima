The planned 50 percent writedown of
Greek government bonds held by private creditors as part of a
debt swap won’t be enough to make the country’s debt
sustainable, an adviser to German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told  To Vima  in an interview.    The write down, which aims to lower  Greece ’s debt to 120
percent of gross domestic product in 2020, will have to be
greater and shouldn’t be voluntary, Oxford University professor
Clemens Fuest told the Athens-based newspaper.  Fuest said the danger that a euro area country may leave
the common currency is existent and that would risk causing a
chain reaction, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
