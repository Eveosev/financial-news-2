Tyler Wilson passed for 216 yards and
two touchdowns to lead the University of Arkansas to a 29-16 win
over  Kansas State University  in college football’s Cotton Bowl.  The Razorbacks had a 19-9 lead at the half last night after
Zack Hocker kicked field goals of 26 and 22 yards, Joe Adams
returned a Wildcats’ punt 51 yards and Wilson completed a 45-
yard pass to Jarius Wright at  Cowboys Stadium  in Arlington,
 Texas .  Hocker’s extra-point kick attempt following Wright’s
touchdown was blocked and returned for a two-point defensive
conversion to give Kansas State two points and Collin Klein
connected with Andre McDonald for a touchdown with 26 seconds
left in the half.  Klein ran six yards on a draw play for a touchdown to start
the third quarter and the Razorbacks capped the second half’s
scoring with Wilson’s pass to Cobi Hamilton and Hocker’s third
