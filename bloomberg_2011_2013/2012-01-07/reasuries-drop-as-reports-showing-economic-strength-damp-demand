Treasuries  fell (USGG10YR)  in the first week of
the year as reports showed gains in U.S. factory output and
jobs, trimming the haven appeal of government securities even as
rising yields on Italian and Spanish debt indicated concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis may widen.  U.S. debt yields pared a weekly gain yesterday after
Federal Reserve Bank of New York President  William Dudley  said
more monetary accommodation to bolster the economy is
appropriate, even after employers added 200,000 positions during
December. A report on Jan. 12 is forecast to show retail sales
rose and the U.S. will auction $66 billion in three, 10- and 30-
year debt next week.  “The  U.S. economy  continues to show good signs,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. “It will be important to see if yields stay around
here, if that will entice people to take down that supply.”  The benchmark 10-year note  yield (USGG10YR)  rose eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point for the week, to 1.96 percent in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
note due in November 2021 dropped 23/32, or $7.19 per $1,000
face amount, to 100 3/8. The yield dropped four basis points
yesterday.  The 30-year yield added 12 basis points to 3.02 percent.  Debt Returns  U.S.  government securities  handed investors a 0.5 percent
loss this month as of Jan. 5, after returning 9.8 percent last
year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  Yields on 10-year debt traded in a 36-basis-point range
since November, with a high of 2.16 percent and a low of 1.8
percent. The yield range was 210 basis points for all of 2011.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed to
a net-long position in 10-year note futures in the week ending
Jan. 3, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 6,236 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The previous week, traders were net-short 2,981
contracts.  The U.S. 10-year yield will increase to 2.66 percent by the
end of 2012, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of banks and securities companies, with the most
recent projections given the heaviest weightings.  European Developments  U.S. yields ticked up even as the euro fell to a 15-month
low against the dollar and  Italy ’s 10-year bond yields climbed
above the 7 percent level that preceded bailouts for  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal  from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund .  Spain ’s 10-year yields posted their biggest weekly increase
in almost 17 years, climbing by 62 basis points this week.  “The euro broke down to new lows, but there wasn’t any of
that fear resonating throughout the market,” said Rogan of
Guggenheim Partners. “Europe was at least somewhat quiet.”  Yields curbed weekly losses yesterday as Dudley called on
the U.S. government to try new programs to revive the housing
market while saying the central bank may still consider ways to
cut  interest rates .  “Implementing such policies would improve the economic
outlook and make monetary accommodation more effective,” Dudley
said in a speech to bankers in Iselin,  New Jersey . At the same
time, it’s “appropriate” for the Fed to consider steps to ease
monetary policy, he said. The  Federal Open Market Committee 
meets Jan. 24-25.  FOMC Preview  “Maybe Dudley’s comments are an early glimpse of what’s
coming at the FOMC meeting,” said  George Goncalves , head of
interest-rate strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., one of 21
primary dealers that trade Treasuries with the Fed. “The doves
will try to dominate. They can try to talk the markets into
believing they will be on hold for longer.”  Minutes released Jan. 3 of the  Federal Reserve ’s Dec. 13
policy meeting said policy makers for the first time will make
public their own forecasts for the federal funds rate beginning
at the Jan. 24-25 meeting. Fed officials will show investors
their forecast for the benchmark interest rate in the fourth
quarter of 2012 and the next few calendar years, the minutes
said.  The central bank purchased $4.93 billion in Treasuries due
in 2018 and 2019 this week and sold $8.7 billion of securities
maturing in 2013. It also sold $1.35 billion of Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities.  It will buy about $45 billion of Treasuries in January and
sell about $44 billion as part of the program, known by traders
as Operation Twist after a similar effort in the 1960s.  Jobs Update  A report yesterday showed gains in jobs last month after an
increase of 100,000 positions the previous month, the Labor
Department said in  Washington . The median forecast of 81
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase of
155,000 jobs. The jobless rate fell to almost a three-year low
8.5 percent.  A report Jan. 3 showed manufacturing in the U.S. expanded
in December at the fastest pace in six months. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s factory index climbed to 53.9 last month
from 52.7 in November, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s data
showed. Fifty is the dividing line between growth and
contraction, and economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast
the gauge would rise to 53.5.  A report Jan. 12 is forecast to show retail sales rose by
0.3 percent, compared with 0.2 percent the previous month,
according to the median forecast of 56 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The Treasury will sell $32 billion in three- year notes,
$21 billion in 10-year securities and $13 billion in 30-year
bonds in three consecutive days starting Jan. 10.  “It will be absorbed really well,” said  Michael Franzese ,
managing director and head of Treasury trading at Wunderlich
Securities Inc. in  New York . “There are tensions all over the
globe right now. Everybody is still in a wait-and-see mode.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
