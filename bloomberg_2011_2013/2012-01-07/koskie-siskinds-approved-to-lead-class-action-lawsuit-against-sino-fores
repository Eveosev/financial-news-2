Koskie Minsky LLP and Siskinds LLP
won approval from an Ontario judge to lead an investor class-
action lawsuit against  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE)  and its executives,
according to court documents.  Ontario Superior Court Judge Paul Perell announced the
decision yesterday in a 57-page judgment. Four firms competed to
be the lead counsel in a class action.  Sino-Forest, a China timber producer, dropped 74 percent in
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange after Carson Block, a
short seller, said in June the company had overstated its forest
plantation assets. The company, with $1.8 billion in bonds
outstanding, has been suspended from share trading since August
and denies the allegations.  Richard Chandler , a billionaire investor whose investment
company owns 19 percent of Sino-Forest according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, said the timber company needs to change
its chief executive officer and appoint new directors.  The law firms are seeking damages on behalf of buyers of
Sino-Forest shares and bonds in both the primary and the
secondary markets, said Dimitri Lascaris, a lawyer at Siskinds,
today by e-mail.  The firms expect to present a motion for certification of
their class-action suit within three months, said Kirk Baert, a
lawyer at Koskie, in a telephone interview.  The case is trustees of the Labourersâ€™ Pension Fund of
Central and Eastern Canada v. Sino-Forest, 11-CV-431153CP,
Superior Court of Justice (Ontario).  To contact the reporter on this story:
