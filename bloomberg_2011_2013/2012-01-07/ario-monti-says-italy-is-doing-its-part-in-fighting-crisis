Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said the country is “doing its part” in fighting the debt
crisis that European countries need to solve together.  “For its economic and social development Italy needs
 Europe , and Europe needs Italy to grow stronger,” Monti said in
a speech in the northern Italian town of Reggio Emilia today,
broadcast on Sky TG24 television.  Italy will take measures to fight corruption, which is
restraining foreign investments, Monti also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
