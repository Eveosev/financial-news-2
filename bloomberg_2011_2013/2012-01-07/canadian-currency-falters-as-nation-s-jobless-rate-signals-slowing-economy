The Canadian dollar declined on
speculation that growth in the nation’s economy is cooling as
the euro-area debt crisis lingers.  The currency, nicknamed the loonie, dropped this week
against its commodity-linked peers of Australia and  New Zealand 
even as crude ended the week above $100 a barrel.  Canada ’s
employers added fewer jobs than economists predicted and the
jobless rate climbed for a third month. The Bank of Canada is
due to release its quarterly business outlook survey on Jan. 9.  “We’re not seeing strong support for the loonie at all,”
said  Dean Popplewell , head analyst in Toronto at the online-
currency trading firm Oanda Corp., in a telephone interview. “I
would be very comfortable to short the loonie at these levels.”
A short is a bet the price of an asset will go down.  Canada’s currency depreciated 0.8 percent to C$1.0284 per
 U.S. dollar  yesterday in Toronto, from C$1.0213 on Dec. 30. It
touched C$1.0077 on Jan. 3, the strongest level since Dec. 8.
One Canadian dollar buys 97.24 U.S. cents.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.6 percent and the
S&P/TSX Composite Index advanced 1.9 percent. Futures on crude
oil, the nation’s largest export, posted a weekly close above
$100 a barrel for only the second time since June, ending
yesterday at $101.92 a barrel in  New York .  Canadian  government bonds  were little changed on the week.
Yields on the benchmark  10-year note (GCAN10YR)  closed yesterday at 1.937
percent, compared with 1.941 percent on Dec. 30. The 3.25
percent securities due in June 2021 rose 2 cents to C$111.28.  Euro Tumbles  Canada will sell C$3.5 billion ($3.4 billion) of bonds
maturing in May 2014 on Jan. 11. The previous auction of two-
year debt on Dec. 7 fetched an average yield of 0.937 percent
and a coverage ratio, the amount bid for every unit of debt
sold, of 2.527 times. The average ratio over the past five two-
year auctions is 2.49 times.  The euro fell to an 11-year low against the yen and touched
the lowest since January 2011 versus the loonie amid concern
that some of the region’s countries may struggle to fund
themselves.  France  sold 7.96 billion euros ($10.2 billion) of
debt on Jan. 5 as borrowing costs rose in the country’s first
bond auction of the year. Italy and Spain have auctions planned
for next week.  “The biggest worry, obviously, will be what happens in
 Europe  refunding next week,” said Oanda’s Popplewell. “That’s
what’s on everyone’s radar at the moment.”  Jobless Rate  The loonie fell yesterday to the weakest level this year
after  Statistics Canada  said Canada’s jobless rate increased to
7.5 percent from November’s 7.4 percent and the recent low of
7.1 percent in September. Employment rose by 17,500 in the first
gain in three months. The median forecast of 24 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts and economists was for a 7.4
percent jobless rate and a 20,000 job gain.  Investors should buy the Canadian dollar against yen as the
 U.S. economy  improves and the outlook for Japan dims, according
to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  The Canadian currency may strengthen to 79.5 yen within
three months, according to Robert Sinche, global head of
foreign-exchange strategy at RBS in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . The
last time the loonie traded at that level was on Oct. 31.  “We think the Canadian dollar has some good upside,
particularly versus the yen,” Sinche said in a Jan. 5 telephone
interview. He recommends buying the loonie at 75.75 yen and
selling if there is a two-day close below 74.55 yen.  The Canadian dollar was down 1 percent at 74.84 yen in
Toronto. It touched 74.73 yen on Jan. 2, the lowest level since
Nov. 28.  U.S. Beats Forecasts  The U.S. added 200,000 jobs last month following a revised
100,000 gain in November that was smaller than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey called for a December gain of
155,000. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent,
the lowest since February 2009, while hours worked and earnings
climbed.  The U.S. number “continues to contribute to some of the
optimism that’s been in the U.S. data,”  Jack Spitz , managing
director of foreign exchange at National  Bank of Canada  in
Toronto, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “It serves to
show the divergence of economics and fundamentals between this
side of the Atlantic and the other side of the Atlantic.”  Spitz predicted both the greenback and the loonie would
outperform major counterparts into the new year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
