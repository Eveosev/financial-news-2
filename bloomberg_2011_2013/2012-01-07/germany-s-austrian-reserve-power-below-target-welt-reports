Germany ’s reserve power-generation
capacity in  Austria  is below German government targets after
talks between network operators and Austria’s Wien Energie GmbH
on using a 140-megawatt natural-gas plant failed,  Die Welt 
reported, citing an unidentified spokesman for the Austrian
company.  That means Germany can only access three reserve power
plants in the country with a combined 935-megawatt capacity to
stabilize its own grids, rather than four facilities capable of
generating 1,075 megawatts, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
