Fraport AG (FRA)  has abandoned plans to bid
for 20-year concessions to run  Spain ’s largest airports because
of “difficult” market conditions,  Cinco Dias  reported today,
citing an unidentified spokesman for the company.  In October, Spain’s Aena Aeropuertos SA extended the period
to present offers for the Madrid-Barajas and Barcelona-El Prat
airport concessions by three months until Jan. 31, and Fraport
is the first of seven interested parties to desist, the
newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
