Greece  will not be able to bear its
debt burden under the current restructuring plan because of a
worsening economy,  Der Spiegel  said, citing an internal
International Monetary Fund document.  IMF experts plan to adjust key points of the current rescue
plan as part of the next Troika mission, set to start in mid-
January, the magazine said.  Greece must do more to consolidate its finances, or private
creditors must write off a larger share of their claims or euro
area countries have to add more funding,  Der Spiegel  cited the
IMF document as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
