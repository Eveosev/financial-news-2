German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
the two leaders of her government coalition parties have agreed
on a procedure to nominate a successor in case President
Christian Wulff steps down,  Rheinische Post  reported today,
without saying how it got the information.  The government would propose a candidate that would also
find the support of the opposition Social Democrats and the
Green Party, according to the newspaper. Possible successors
include Katrin Goering-Eckardt, a deputy head of Germany’s lower
house of parliament and a member of the Green party, and Klaus
Toepfer, executive director of the UN Environment Program and a
member of Merkel’s  Christian Democrats , Rheinische Post said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
