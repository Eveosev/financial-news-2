The  euro (EUR)  fell for a fifth week versus
the dollar in its longest losing streak in almost two years on
concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening and as data showed the
U.S. labor market is strengthening.  The 17-nation currency slid to a record low against the
Australian dollar and traded at the weakest level in more than
11 years versus the yen as demand at bond auctions spurred
concern European nations will struggle to sell debt. The pound
rose to a 15-month high versus the euro before the  European
Central Bank  meets on Jan. 12. Hungary’s forint tumbled and
Fitch Ratings downgraded the country to junk.  “One of the factors driving the market right now is a
general lack of demand for European assets,” said Shahab Jalinoos, a senior currency strategist in  Stamford ,  Connecticut ,
at UBS AG. “There are enough sources of new bad news to keep
the market adapting; all the bad news is not priced in yet.”  The euro fell 1.9 percent to $1.2717 yesterday in New York
in its biggest five-day loss since Dec. 16. It hasn’t fallen for
five straight weeks since February 2010. It touched $1.2698, its
weakest level since Sept. 13, 2010. The shared currency
depreciated 1.8 percent to 97.90 yen and reached 97.88 yen, the
lowest since December 2000. The dollar was little changed at
76.97 yen.  It was the worst week for  Europe ’s common currency in four
months. The euro lost 1.3 percent against nine developed-nation
peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted  Currency
Indexes (BCWIEUR) , the most since it dropped 1.9 percent in the five days
ended Sept. 2.  Bets Against Euro  Futures traders increased their  bets (.ECLRG)  that the euro will
decline against the dollar to a record high. The difference
between wagers the shared currency would fall versus those that
it would rise -- so-called net shorts -- surged to 138,909 in
the week ended Jan. 3, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  Sterling reached its strongest versus the euro yesterday
since Sept. 10, 2010, touching 82.39 pence. It gained 1.1
percent on the week. The pound slipped 0.8 percent to $1.5426.  The euro dropped as  France  sold 4.02 billion euros ($5.11
billion) of benchmark 10-year notes Jan. 5 at an average yield
of 3.29 percent, compared with 3.18 percent at a sale on Dec. 1.
The bid-to-cover ratio, the number of bids received for each
unit of debt sold, fell to 1.64, from 3.05. Demand at a German
auction of 10-year bonds a day earlier was lower than the five-
year average. France, Greece,  Germany , Italy and  Spain  are all
scheduled to sell debt next week.  ‘Significant Downside Risk’  “The market is very cognizant, and has been for quite some
time, that there’s some very significant downside risk as far as
the euro is concerned,”  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group-of-10
foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, said
Jan. 5 in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop”
with Betty Liu. “Increasingly they’re putting their money where
their thoughts are. You’re seeing the euro really trade quite
weak against a host of currencies.”  France’s credit outlook was lowered by  Fitch Ratings  on
Dec. 16 on the “heightened risk of contingent liabilities” from
the escalating euro-region crisis. S&P is reviewing the top
ratings of both France and Germany.  The ECB will leave its main  refinancing rate (EURR002W)  at 1 percent
next week after lowering it from 1.5 percent since November,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Hungary’s forint slid to a record low of 324.24 per euro
Jan. 5 before erasing a weekly loss as the government said it’s
ready to discuss conditions for an International Monetary Fund
loan. Fitch became the third rating company in two months to cut
Hungary’s credit to junk, saying there still are doubts about
the nation’s agreement to conditions for aid.  The forint ended the week at 314.35 per euro.  Yuan Weakens  The yuan had its first weekly decline in a month after the
People’s Bank of  China  set the fixing 0.18 percent weaker on
Jan. 5, the biggest reduction since Nov. 15, amid concern
Europe’s debt crisis will cool demand for the nation’s goods.  China’s currency fell 0.3 percent to 6.3095, according to
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.2919 on
Jan. 4, the strongest since the country unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, increased 1.3 percent to 81.26.  The gauge rose yesterday as Labor Department data showed
U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs last month,
compared with the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey for
a gain of 155,000. The jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 8.5
percent, the lowest since February 2009.  Beating Estimates  The economic performance of the U.S. is beating economists’
estimates, while those of other regions are trailing them.
Citigroup Inc.’s  Economic Surprise Index (CESIUSD)  for the U.S., which
measures whether data exceed or miss forecasts, rose to 91.90
yesterday, the highest since March. Its average for the past
year is negative 3.5. The  euro region (CESIEUR) ’s Economic Surprise Index
fell to negative 19.6, while  Canada (CESICAD) ’s slid to negative 21.9.  Mexico ’s peso was the top performer versus the dollar this
week, climbing 1.4 percent to 13.7391.  Brazil ’s real gained 0.6
percent to 1.8566 per dollar, and  New Zealand ’s dollar
appreciated 0.4 percent to 78.06 U.S. cents.  Australia ’s dollar rallied to a record 80.51 euro cents
yesterday. It gained for eight consecutive days versus the
shared currency, the longest winning streak since December 2010.
Against the greenback, the Aussie advanced 0.2 percent on the
week to $1.0228.  To contact the reporters on this story:
