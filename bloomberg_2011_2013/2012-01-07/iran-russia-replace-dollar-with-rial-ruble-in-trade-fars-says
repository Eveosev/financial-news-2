Iran  and Russia replaced the U.S.
dollar with their national currencies in bilateral trade, Iranâ€™s
state-run Fars news agency reported, citing Seyed Reza Sajjadi,
the Iranian ambassador in Moscow.  The proposal to switch to the ruble and the rial was raised
by Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  at a meeting with his
Iranian counterpart, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in Astana, Kazakhstan,
of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the ambassador said.  Iran has replaced the dollar in its oil trade with India,
 China  and Japan, Fars reported.  The European Union, the U.S. and the United Nations are
applying sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program. Iran
says its nuclear efforts are for civilian purposes and to
generate electricity, while the U.S. and several major allies
say the program represents a weapons threat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
