Israeli defense chief Udi Shani has
flown to  South Korea  for talks on a $1 billion contract for
trainer jets, United Press International reported yesterday,
without citing anyone.  Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. (047810)  and  Italy ’s Alenia
Aermacchi SpA are competing for the sale, the report said. An
official at South Korea’s defense ministry declined to comment.
He declined to be named, citing military policy.  Shani was in Italy last week for talks with Alenia, which
has offered its M-346 Master as a replacement for the Israeli
air force’s Douglas A-4 Skyhawks, which are being retired, UPI
said. Korea Aerospace is offering its T-50 Golden Eagle trainer,
the report said.  Korea Aerospace, the country’s biggest planemaker, won a
$400 million contract in May to sell 16 T-50s to Indonesia, and
expects that first export order for the aircraft may also help
it win sales in Israel, Poland and the U.S.  The South Korean government has said that it aims to boost
annual overseas sales of weapons to $4 billion and expand total
production to $10 billion in 2020.  Korea Aerospace (047810)  shares fell 0.7 percent to close at 38,350
won yesterday, while the local benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  index dropped 1.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
