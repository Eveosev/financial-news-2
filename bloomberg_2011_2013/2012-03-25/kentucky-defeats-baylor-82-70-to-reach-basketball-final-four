The  University of Kentucky  defeated
 Baylor University  82-70 to advance to the semifinals of college
basketball’s national men’s basketball tournament for the second
straight year and 15th time in school history.  The Wildcats (36-2), the top overall seed in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, will play  Louisville 
for a place in the April 2 title game in  New Orleans . No. 4
Louisville yesterday rallied to defeat No. 7 Florida 72-68 in
the West Regional final.  Kentucky jumped out to a 42-22 halftime lead at the Georgia
Dome in Atlanta and led third-seeded Baylor by as many as 23
points during the second half. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist scored a
team-high 19 points for the Wildcats, while fellow freshman
forward Anthony Davis had 18 points and 11 rebounds.  Kentucky  is two wins from an eighth NCAA title and first
since 1998 after collecting its record 109th tournament victory,
one more than the University of  North Carolina .  The Tar Heels, the top seed in the Midwest Regional, can
tie Kentucky with a victory against No. 2  Kansas  in today’s
second tournament matchup. North Carolina is playing its second
straight contest without point guard Kendall Marshall because of
a broken bone in his right wrist.  The Midwest Regional winner advances to play  Ohio State ,
which toppled No. 1 seed Syracuse 77-70 yesterday to win the
East Regional. The Final Four is scheduled for March 31 at the
Superdome in New Orleans.  Calipari’s Record  Kentucky coach  John Calipari  returns to the Final Four for
a fourth time after improving his record to 545-154 and 36-13 in
the NCAA tournament. Calipari’s Wildcats lost to the University
of  Connecticut  in last year’s national semifinals.  After falling behind 10-5 during the opening minutes in
Atlanta, Kentucky went on a 16-0 scoring run. The Wildcats kept
pulling away and pushed their lead to 51-28 less than four
minutes into the second half. Baylor (30-8) never got closer
than 10 points the rest of the way in suffering its first loss
of the season against a school outside the Big 12 Conference.  “This team is actually even better than I thought,”
Baylor coach Scott Drew said of the Wildcats. “We definitely
haven’t played a better team than them all year.”  Quincy Acy scored 22 points and Pierre Jackson had 21 for
Baylor, which shot 39 percent to Kentucky’s 53 percent.  Today’s game was the first between the Bears and the
Wildcats in the NCAA tournament since Kentucky beat Baylor 58-42
in the 1948 title game. Kentucky has won all seven games between
the schools. The matchup was the first between the schools since
Dec. 8, 1979.  To contact the reporter on this story:
