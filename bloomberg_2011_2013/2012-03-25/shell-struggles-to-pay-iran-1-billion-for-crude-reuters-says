Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is struggling
to hand over $1 billion owed to  Iran  for crude-oil shipments
because U.S. and European Union sanctions make it almost
impossible to process payments, Reuters reported, citing four
unidentified industry sources.  A debt of that size equates to about four large tanker
loads of Iranian crude or about 8 million barrels, the news wire
said. Ross Whittam, a Shell spokesman, declined to comment today
when contacted by phone.  Shell asked the U.K. government for help in settling its
account with Iran and was rebuffed, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
