Bondholders are overestimating the
risk that  Greece  will seek additional debt forgiveness or leave
the euro after the country carried out the largest restructuring
in history, said  Domingo Cavallo , who led  Argentina ’s efforts in
2001 to avoid what would become a record sovereign default.  This month’s restructuring, which allowed Greece to write
off more than 100 billion euros ($131 billion) of debt, provides
the country enough relief to allow it to overhaul the economy,
said Cavallo, who resigned as economy minister as Argentina
defaulted on $95 billion in December 2001. European policy
makers may lower the costs of the region’s loans to Greece if
needed and will help keep the country in the euro, he said.  Yields on Greek bonds due in February 2023 rose above 20
percent last week for the first time since the government issued
them as part of the debt exchange. Yields climbed 17 basis
points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 20.27 percent as of 10:12
a.m. New York time, from 18.5 percent on March 12 as concerns
mounted that the exchange didn’t cut debt levels to sustainable
levels. The bonds’ price fell to 24.63 cents from 27.83 cents on
March 12, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “If I had those bonds, I would keep them and wouldn’t sell
them at such a discount,” Cavallo, 65, said in a March 24
interview at a Yale University conference in  New Haven ,
 Connecticut . Today’s prices are “misguided,” he said.  Pimco Disagrees  Cavallo, who’s now the chief executive officer of DFC
Associates LLC, a consulting firm in  Buenos Aires , tamed
Argentina’s hyperinflation in the early 1990s by pegging the
peso to the dollar, limiting money supply growth and selling
state companies. Then-President Fernando de la Rua brought
Cavallo back as economy minister in March 2001 in a failed bid
to maintain the currency system and avert default as the
country’s recession deepened.  Greece received euro-area member states’ approval on March
14 for a second bailout of 130 billion euros ($172 billion)
after the country agreed to carry out the debt exchange and
implement spending cuts. The restructuring is designed to lower
 Greece’s debt  to the equivalent of 120.5 percent of gross
domestic product by 2020 from about 160 percent of GDP.  For  Europe , the cost of having Greece exit the 17-nation
euro region “is much higher” than keeping it in and
“implementing necessary reforms gradually,” Cavallo said.
“Greece owes Europe a lot of money. If Greece still has large
fiscal deficits for a while, Europe will help.”  Pacific Investment Management Co., which manages the
world’s biggest bond fund, sees a “significant risk” Greece
will leave the euro,  Andrew Balls , London-based head of European
 portfolio management , wrote on the company’s website on March
19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
