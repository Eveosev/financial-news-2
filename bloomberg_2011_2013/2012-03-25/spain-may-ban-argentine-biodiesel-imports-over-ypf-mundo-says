Spain may threaten to ban biodiesel
imports from  Argentina  as part of a dispute between the two
nations over the Argentine unit of  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , El Mundo
reported, without saying where it got the information.  A ministerial order to block Argentine biodiesel imports
was signed by the previous government last year although former
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero held off putting it
into law amid pressure from Argentine President Cristina
Fernandez de Kirchner, the newspaper said.  The government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, in power
since December, decided not to sign the order into law for
political reasons, preferring to keep it on “stand-by,” El
Mundo said.  Argentina earns 750 million euros ($995 million) a year
selling  Spain  750,000 metric tons of biodiesel, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
