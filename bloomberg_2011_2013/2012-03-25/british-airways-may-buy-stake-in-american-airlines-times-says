International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA (IAG) , owner of British Airways, may buy a stake in  American
Airlines (AMR1)  to pre-empt a similar move by a rival, the  Sunday Times
reported , without saying how it obtained the information.  IAG has been prompted to consider the step as  US Airways
Group Inc. (LCC)  and  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  also may bid for U.S.-based
American, according to the report. William Walsh, IAGâ€™s chief
executive officer, is weighing several options, the Times said.  Laura Goodes, a spokeswoman for IAG, declined to comment
when reached today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
