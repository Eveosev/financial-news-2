     March 25 (Bloomberg) -- Egypt  agreed to export 650 metric
tons of cotton in the week ending March 22, the Alexandria
Cotton Exporters Association said in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 66,345 metric tons of cotton valued
at $208.8 million since the marketing year beginning Sept 1. Of
last week’s sales, Egypt will ship 650 tons of the Giza 86
cotton variety, the association said today.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-end clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are
the largest importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
