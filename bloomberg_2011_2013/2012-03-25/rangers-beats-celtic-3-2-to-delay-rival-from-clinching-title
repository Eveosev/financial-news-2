Rangers beat nine-man Celtic 3-2
today to delay its Glasgow rival’s bid to win the Scottish
Premier League soccer title.  Sone Aluko, Andrew Little and Lee Wallace scored at Ibrox
stadium as Rangers avoided what would have been a club-record
fourth straight home defeat. Cha Du-Ri and Victor Wanyana were
red-carded for Celtic.   Rangers’s Carlos Bocanegra was then dismissed with two
minutes remaining and Celtic threatened a comeback,  Scott Brown 
scoring from a penalty kick and Thomas Rogne with a header.  Celtic only needs four points from its remaining seven
games to guarantee a 43rd league title and first since 2008.
Record 54-time champion Rangers has claimed the championship the
past three years and is second in this season’s standings, 18
points behind Celtic.   Rangers went into administration, a form of bankruptcy,
Feb. 14 as U.K. tax authorities chased the team over unpaid
bills and incurred a 10-point deduction in the league.  To contact the reporter on this story:
