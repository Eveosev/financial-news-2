General Electric Co. (GE)  will open a
U.K. bank in mid-April, the Sunday Telegraph said.  The new Internet bank, to be called GE Capital Direct, will
be the biggest entry into the U.K. banking industry since the
financial crisis, the London newspaper reported, without
specifying the source of the information. GE will seek to add
billions of pounds of savings to its U.K. corporate loan book
worth more than 10 billion pounds, the report said. A GE Capital
spokesman declined to comment, according to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
