Japan  and Canada agreed to start
negotiations on a free-trade agreement, the leaders of the two
countries said.  Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  and Canadian Prime
Minister  Stephen Harper  made the announcement after meeting
today in  Tokyo .  “A free-trade agreement with Japan -- a powerful G-8
economy and respected Asia-Pacific partner -- would strengthen
the Canadian economy by generating billions of additional
dollars in commercial flows between our two countries,” Harper
said in a statement.  Harper is in Tokyo as part of a six-day trip to Asia to
build trade and investment ties. The prime minister said on
Friday his government would study the economic benefits of a
free-trade pact with Thailand.  Japan and  Canada  last year had C$23.7 billion ($23.7
billion) in combined merchandise trade, according to Canadian
government figures. Japan exported goods valued at C$13 billion
to Canada, which exported C$10.7 billion the other way.  Canada was Japan’s 18th largest trading partner in 2010,
while Japan was Canada’s fifth biggest partner, according to a
joint  study  by the two countries released this month.  A free-trade agreement would increase Japan’s gross
domestic product by between 0.08 percent and 0.09 percent, while
augmenting Canada’s GDP by between 0.24 percent and 0.57 percent,
the study found.  Canada will seek the elimination of Japanese tariffs in a
number of sectors, including agriculture, fish and seafood,
forestry and industrial goods, according to a statement
distributed by the prime minister’s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
