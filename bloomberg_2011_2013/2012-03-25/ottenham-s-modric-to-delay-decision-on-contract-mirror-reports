Tottenham’s Luka Modric will not
sign a new contract until he knows who will be the club’s
manager next season, with  Harry Redknapp  linked to role of
England soccer coach, the Sunday Mirror reported.  Spurs rejected a 40 million-pound ($63.5 million) bid from
Chelsea for the 26-year-old Croatian last year and has been
working on a new six-year contract for Modric worth 140,000
pounds a week,  the newspaper said , without citing anyone.  England’s Football Association is set to wait until the end
of the Premier League season before making any approaches for a
new manager, with Redknapp a leading candidate, the Mirror said.  Spurs will hold talks with Modric at the end of the month,
but he will delay his decision on accepting a deal, the Mirror
reported.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
