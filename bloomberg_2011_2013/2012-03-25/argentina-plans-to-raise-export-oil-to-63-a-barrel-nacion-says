Argentina ’s Energy Secretary Daniel Cameron will propose that  oil prices  for export be raised to $63
per barrel from the current $42, the Argentine newspaper La
Nacion  reported  today on its website.  The proposal was ready two weeks ago, La Nacion said,
without saying how it obtained the information.  A decade-long freeze on oil prices, which set the maximum
producers could charge for exports at $42 per barrel, has
hindered investment in Argentina.  Production dropped to 35.3 million cubic meters in 2010
from 45.4 million in 2001, according to data published by the
Buenos Aires-based Argentina Oil and Gas Institute.  Argentine fuel imports more than doubled in 2011 from a
year earlier to $9.4 billion, contributing to the narrowing of
the country’s  trade surplus  to a one-year low of $280 million in
December. Blocked from international credit markets since a 2001
default on $95 billion of bonds, the government depends on its
 trade surplus  to bring dollars into the economy and build
central bank reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
