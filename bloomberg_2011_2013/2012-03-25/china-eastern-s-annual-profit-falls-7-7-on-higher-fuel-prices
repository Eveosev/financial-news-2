China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670) , the
nation’s second-biggest carrier by passenger numbers, said
profit fell 7.7 percent last year as fuel prices rose.  Net income  dropped to 4.58 billion yuan ($727 million),
from 4.96 billion yuan, the company said in a filing to the Hong
Kong stock exchange today. That missed the 5.1 billion-yuan
average of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 12 percent.  The aviation industry in China in 2012 will “face
significant pressures as a result of complex and changing
domestic and international operating environments, significant
cost increases and general downturn in the global aviation
industry,” the carrier said in the statement.  China Eastern  said it will tighten cost control, strengthen
capital operations and diversify financing channels to meet the
challenges. The Shanghai-based airline has abandoned an
international expansion drive to focus on competing with  China
Southern Airlines Co. (1055)  and  Air China Ltd. (601111)  in the domestic market.  China Eastern flew 68.7 million passengers last year, 5.8
percent more than a year earlier, the company said. Its
passenger load factor, or the percentage of seats filled by
paying customers, increased 0.9 percentage point to 78.9
percent.  Jet Fuel Prices  Fuel costs jumped 35 percent in the year because of higher
prices and an increase in services. Jet kerosene prices averaged
$125.6 a barrel in Singapore trading in 2011, 40 percent higher
than the year before, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Eastern fell 1.9 percent to close at HK$2.63 in Hong
Kong trading on March 23. It’s declined 16 percent in the past
year, compared with a 9 percent drop for the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index .  The carrier said its board didn’t recommend a dividend for
last year.  Li Jiaxiang, director of China’s civil aviation regulator,
said earlier this month that passenger growth will slow this
year. The cooling of the Chinese economy and the European debt
crisis are damping overseas  travel demand , China Eastern
Chairman Liu Shaoyong said earlier this month.  The carrier last year dropped an order for  Boeing Co. (BA)  787
Dreamliners in favor of 45 smaller 737s because of delivery
delays and slowing demand for long-haul international travel.  Chinese carriers flew a total of 292.2 million travelers in
2011, 9.2 percent more than a year earlier, according to the
regulator’s  data .  --Jasmine Wang and Victoria Ruan. Editors: Vipin V. Nair,
