Britain is training soldiers to
transport fuel to petrol stations amid concern about a possible
strike by oil tanker drivers, the Sunday Times said, citing
Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude.  Four hundred soldiers are ready to drive lorries from
refineries should oil tanker drivers vote to strike after the
ballot of 2,000 workers, supported by the Unite union, closes
tomorrow, the newspaper said.  Maude said the government has “learnt the lessons of the
past and stand ready to act to minimise disruption to motorists,
to industry and to our  emergency services  in the event of a
strike,” the Sunday Times cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
