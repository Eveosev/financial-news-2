Seven Afghan soldiers and one U.S.
soldier were killed yesterday in  Afghanistan ’s southern Kandahar
province after an improvised explosive device went off.  The explosion also killed an Afghan interpreter and wounded
an U.S. soldier, Jawid Faisal, a spokesman for the province,
said by phone. “They wanted to defuse an IED, but they
failed,” he said.  The device exploded at around 9:00 p.m. yesterday local
time in the northwestern  Arghandab  district of the province. Two
days ago, an Taliban suicide attack killed two Afghan children
and wounded 8 others, including 2 Afghan policemen, at a police
station in the city of Kandahar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
