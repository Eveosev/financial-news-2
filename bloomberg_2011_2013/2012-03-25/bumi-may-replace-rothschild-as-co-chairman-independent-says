Bumi Plc (BUMI)  may replace billionaire
founder  Nathaniel Rothschild  as co-chairman, the Independent
newspaper reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  Sumin Tan, who bought almost a quarter of Bumi in November,
will probably replace co-chairman Indra Bakrie at a board
meeting tomorrow, the newspaper reported. Bakrie will probably
take the seat held by Rothschild, who will remain a non-
 executive director , the Independent said.  Nalin Rothod will replace Ari Hudaya as chief executive
officer and Scott Merrilees will take over as chief financial
officer from Andrew Beckham, the newspaper said. A Bumi
spokesman declined to comment today via phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
