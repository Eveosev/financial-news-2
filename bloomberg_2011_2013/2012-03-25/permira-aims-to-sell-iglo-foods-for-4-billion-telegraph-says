Permira Advisers LLP, a European
private-equity firm, is seeking to sell Iglo Foods Group Ltd.,
the continent’s largest frozen-food company, for almost 3
billion euros ($3.98 billion), the Sunday Telegraph said.  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  will run the auction, which will be one of
the biggest private-equity deals this year, the London newspaper
reported, without saying how it obtained theinformation. Iglo’s
profit has grown 8 percent every year since 2008, and Permira
hopes to sell the business for eight or nine times earnings,
valuing it at 2.6 to 2.9 billion euros, according to the
article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
