President  Dmitry Medvedev  pledged
Russia’s support for  Kofi Annan ’s “last chance” mission to end
Syria’s yearlong conflict and avert full-scale civil war.  “Probably this is the last chance to avoid long-lasting
and bloody civil war,” Medvedev said at a meeting with Annan, a
former United Nations Secretary-General, in Moscow today. “We
will render our full support to the extent Russia is capable of.
We hope your mission will have positive results.”  Russia blames the fighting largely on the armed opposition,
though it has criticized President Bashar al-Assad’s government
for mistakes made during the crisis.  Efforts to end the conflict have so far failed, with Russia
and China twice blocking UN Security Council resolutions aimed
at removing Assad. Last week, the world body agreed a non-
binding statement supporting Annan’s mission to agree a
ceasefire and access for humanitarian supplies. Assad’s battle
to preserve his family’s four-decade hold on power has claimed
more than 8,000 lives, the UN estimates.  “A cease-fire in  Syria  will be difficult to achieve
without blocking military and political support for the
opposition from abroad,”  Sergei Prikhodko , Medvedev’s foreign
policy aide, told reporters in Moscow earlier on Friday.  Medvedev met Annan at Vnukovo airport near Moscow before
taking off to  South Korea  for a nuclear security summit due to
be attended by about 50 world leaders. Tomorrow Medvedev will
meet U.S. President Barack Obama to discuss the conflict in
Syria, the situation in Iraq, Afghanistan and missile defenses
in South Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
