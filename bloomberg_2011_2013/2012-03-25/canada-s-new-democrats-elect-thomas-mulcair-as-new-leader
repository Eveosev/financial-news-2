Canada ’s main opposition  New
Democratic Party  elected  Thomas Mulcair , a lawmaker from the
French-speaking province of  Quebec , as their new leader at a
convention in Toronto.  Mulcair, 57, who joined the NDP in 2007 following more than
a decade as a Quebec provincial legislator, replaces interim
leader Nycole Turmel.  The NDP leadership race was forced by the death in August
of NDP leader  Jack Layton , who led Canada’s pro-labor party to
their best election result in its 50-year history in elections
last year.  The May 2 election, which vaulted the NDP past the  Liberal
Party  to become the country’s biggest opposition party, was won
by Prime Minister  Stephen Harper ’s governing  Conservative Party .  To contact the reporter on this story:
