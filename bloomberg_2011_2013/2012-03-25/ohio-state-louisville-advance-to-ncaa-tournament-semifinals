Second-seeded  Ohio State University 
and fourth-seeded University of Louisville advanced to the
semifinals of the national men’s college basketball
championship.  Ohio State, which toppled No. 1 seed Syracuse 77-70, will
play top-seeded  North Carolina  or No. 2 seed  Kansas  in the next
round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament. Louisville, which rallied to beat No. 7 Florida
72-68, will meet No. 1 seed  Kentucky  or third-seeded Baylor.  The matchups will be decided today for the semifinals being
held on March 31.  Jared Sullinger had 19 points for the Buckeyes who captured
the East Region’s championship last night at TD Garden in
 Boston . Lenzelle Smith Jr. added 18 for Ohio State (31-7), which
is making its first trip to the semifinals since 2007 when it
lost to  Florida  in the national championship.  “We’re not going down to  New Orleans  for a vacation. It’s
a business trip,” Sullinger told reporters.  Ohio State was one of four Ohio teams in the regional
semifinals and the only one to reach the regional finals. It is
the only surviving team from the Big 10’s original six.  Brandon Triche had 15 points and Scoop Jardine had 14 for
the Orange (34-3).  ‘Can’t Lose Confidence’  At US Airways Center in Phoenix, Chane Behanan hit the go-
ahead basket for Louisville (30-9) with one minute, four seconds
left in the West Region’s final to extend the team’s winning
streak to eight. The Cardinals, down by 41-33 at the half,
outscored the Gators (26-11) by 15 points in the final 10
minutes.  Russ Smith had 19 points and Behanan added 17 for
Louisville, which reached the semifinals for the first time
since 2005.  “What happens is, you can’t lose confidence,” Louisville
coach Rick Pitino told reporters. “I kept telling our guys
we’re going to the Final Four. Win the Big East tournament,
we’re going to the Final Four. And they did.”  Erik Murphy and Bradley Beal led the Gators with 14 points
each.  The championship game is April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
