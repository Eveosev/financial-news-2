Brad Richards and  Ryan Callahan 
scored goals in a shootout to give the National Hockey League-
leading  New York Rangers  a 4-3 victory over the  Toronto Maple
Leafs .  The Eastern Conference-leading Rangers (47-21-7) with 101
points share the league lead with the St. Louis Blues (46-20-9),
their counterpart atop the Western Conference.  Cody Franson gave the Maple Leafs a 1-0 lead midway through
the first period before Marian Gaborik tied the game at 1-1
three minutes later, with his first of two goals at Madison
Square Garden in New York.  Toronto’s Joey Crabb and New York’s Brandon Dubinsky each
had goals to end the second period tied at 2-2, while Gaborik
got his second goal and Tim Connolly hit the net for a 3-3 tie
in the final period.  Maple Leafs center Connolly scored on a 19-foot backhand
shot in the shootout, followed by two 32-foot wristshots by
Rangers center Richards and right wing Callahan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
