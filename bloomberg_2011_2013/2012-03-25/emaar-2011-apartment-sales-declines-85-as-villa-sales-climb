Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the
developer of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai, said revenue
from apartment sales plunged 85 percent last year. Sales of
villas climbed 85 percent during the period.  Income from apartment sales dropped to 1.11 billion dirhams
($303 million) from 7.56 billion dirhams a year earlier,
according to Emaar’s  financial statement  posted on Dubai’s stock
market today. Revenue from the sale of villas rose to 959
million dirhams from 517.3 million dirhams. Emaar posted a 27
percent decline in full-year profit on Feb. 14 and provided a
breakdown of revenue today.  Dubai’s housing market is hitting bottom after a boom led
by speculators collapsed in 2008, causing prices to drop by more
than 65 percent. Villas are now attracting more interest than
apartments, which dominate Dubai’s market, as rental yields on
villas tend to be higher.  “Incoming supply remains substantial and it remains
premature to call a broad recovery in the residential sector,
regardless of recent demand trends in terms of villas and
apartments,” said Mohammad Kamal, a Dubai-based analyst at
Arqaam Capital. “If prices improve 0.5 percent in a specific
district, that doesn’t mean the broader sector is improving.”  Emaar, which is 31 percent owned by Dubai’s government,
plans to pay a 10 fils dividend for 2011.  Average Return  The company said the money owed by  Amlak Finance PJSC (AMLAK) , the
mortgage lender being reorganized by the  United Arab Emirates ’
government, was lowered last year to 595 million dirhams from
712 million dirhams a year earlier. The amount is unsecured and
earns an average return ranging from 3.13 percent to 4 percent a
year, compared with 4 percent to 4.5 percent in 2010, it said.  Amlak, in which Emaar owns 45 percent stake, had its
liabilities cut by 4 billion dirhams after it sold land and
reached agreements with some creditors, the United Arab
Emirates’ Economy Minister Sultan Bin Saeed al-Mansouri was
cited as saying in a statement posted on the ministry’s website
last week.   Emaar’s shares  have gained 17 percent this year. Fifteen
analysts recommend investors buy Emaar shares, two have a hold
rating and one a sell  recommendation , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
