EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  will grow faster than
the European air transport market, Chief Executive Officer
Carolyn McCall told  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung .  EasyJet’s growth will come “with a profit,” the newspaper
quoted McCall as saying. “We are looking now for profitable
growth and don’t only want to gain market share.”  The European air transport market will be hampered by high
 oil prices , McCall said according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
