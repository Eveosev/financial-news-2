Mohamed Merah, who killed seven
people in and around Toulouse, said he had plans to commit
attacks in the capital city Paris,  Le Journal du Dimanche 
reported, citing an unidentified police officer.  Merah, 23, told the special police officers who were
seeking to negotiate his surrender that the killings in Toulouse
were just a start. He added that he wanted to see and touch his
victims before they died, JDD quoted the officer as saying.  Between March 11 and 19, Merah killed three paratroopers,
three children and one teacher at a Jewish school. He was shot
dead by the police on March 21.  Separately Agence France-Presse reported today that Merah’s
brother, who is suspected to have supported him in his actions,
will be questioned by a anti-terrorism judge in Paris and is
likely to be formally indicted, AFP reported, citing the lawyer
of Abdelkader Merah’s wife.  To contact the reporters on this story:
