Glencore International Plc (GLEN) ’s $6.1
billion bid for  Viterra Inc. (VT)  will keep many of the acquired
company’s assets in “Canadian hands,” Prime Minister Stephen Harper said.  Harper commented today at a news conference in  Tokyo  on
Glencore’s proposed acquisition of Viterra,  Canada ’s biggest
grain handler. As part of the transaction, Calgary-based  Agrium
Inc. (AGU)  will acquire about 90 percent of Viterra’s Canadian retail
facilities. Glencore has also agreed to sell assets to
Richardson International Ltd., a unit of Winnipeg-based James
Richardson & Sons Ltd.  “My understanding of the deal is that many of the assets
will actually remain in Canadian hands, so I’m not sure it
really would be categorized at this point as primarily a foreign
investment,” said Harper, after meeting with Japanese Prime
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda .  The deal shows how much interest there is in the Canadian
grain and agriculture sector, which is “a tremendously good
thing,” Harper said.  He added that such interest is “genuinely welcomed by
farmers, and our main concern is always that farmers will retain
choice in terms of their marketing options going forward.”  Under the Investment Canada Act, the federal government
reviews foreign acquisitions of companies with assets valued at
more than C$330 million ($330 million). The C$16.25-a-share
offer announced by Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore will also
require approval from Canada’s Competition Bureau, which said it
would be reviewing the proposed transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
