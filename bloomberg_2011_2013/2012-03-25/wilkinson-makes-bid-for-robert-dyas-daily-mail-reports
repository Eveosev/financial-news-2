Wilkinson, a discount housewares
chain in the U.K., made a bid for Robert Dyas, the Daily Mail
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Two other trade buyers and one private-equity firm are also
competing to acquire the business, the London newspaper said.
The sale is expected to fetch about 25 million pounds ($39.7
million), according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
