Chevron Corp. (CVX)  won’t be expelled
from Brazil for two offshore oil spills, O Estado de Sao Paulo
reported, citing an interview with Mines and Energy Minister
Edison Lobao.  While the national oil regulator, or ANP, is convinced
Chevron was negligent, neither of the two spills were large
enough to justify expelling the company, Lobao told the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper.  Chevron has said, following a leak at its offshore Frade
project in November and a second seep this month, that it acted
correctly and there was no negligence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
