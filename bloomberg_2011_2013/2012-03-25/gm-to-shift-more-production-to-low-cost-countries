General Motors Co. (GM)  is planning to
shift more of its production to low-cost countries including
Poland, Russia,  China , India, Mexico and Brazil,  Der Spiegel 
reported, citing a company strategy paper.  As the automakerâ€™s output is increasing, GM plans to build
80 percent of the additional units in low-cost countries, the
magazine said in an e-mailed preview of its article.  By 2016, GM plans to export an additional 300,000 vehicles
from factories in Mexico, Korea and China to Europe, Spiegel
