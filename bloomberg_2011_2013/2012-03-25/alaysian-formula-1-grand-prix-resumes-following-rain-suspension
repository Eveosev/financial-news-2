The Malaysian Grand Prix, the
second race of the 2012 Formula One world championship, was
restarted after a suspension because of torrential rain.  Lewis Hamilton  of McLaren was leading when todayâ€™s race was
stopped on the ninth of 56 scheduled laps as rain soaked the
Sepang International Circuit and impaired visibility.  The race resumed behind the safety car with all cars fitted
with wet-weather tires.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
