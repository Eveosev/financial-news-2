OAO Mechel (MTL)  will rebound as
investors dismiss concerns the Russian coal company will lose a
mining license to buy shares trading three times cheaper than
peers, Otkritie Financial Corp. and Renaissance Capital say.  Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s biggest maker of coking coal for steel
production, slid to $9.81 in  New York  on March 23, the lowest
level in almost three weeks. The stock trades for 5.4  times 
estimated earnings, compared with an average 14.6 times for  coal
stocks  listed on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Futures (VEA) 
expiring in June on Moscow’s dollar-denominated  RTS  Index gained
0.6 percent to 162,740 in U.S. trading.  Moscow-based Mechel broke license agreements at parts of
six deposits in Russia’s Far East run by its Yakutugol unit, the
nation’s environmental regulator said on March 22. The body also
found violations by Mechel’s South Kuzbass unit in Siberia, two
people familiar with the investigation who declined to be named
said. Investors have been in a “panic” that Mechel will lose a
license as punishment, according to Otkritie.  “The license termination is very unlikely, there are very
few cases in Russian history of license revocations and I don’t
think they found sufficient reasons,” Denis Gabrielik, an
analyst at Otkritie that rates the company a buy, said by phone
from Moscow on March 23. “Mechel is undervalued. My target
price is $16.60.”  Mechel fell 0.2 percent to $9.81 in U.S. trading on March
23, the lowest level since March 6. The company’s American
depositary receipts declined 9.8 percent last week, the biggest
weekly drop since the five days ended Feb. 10. The  stock  slipped
8.6 percent last week to 289.40 rubles, the equivalent of $9.89,
on Moscow’s Micex Index.  Peabody Energy  The ADR’s valuation has declined from this year’s high of
6.5 times estimated earnings on Feb. 7.  Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , the
third-largest U.S. coal producer and a member of the S&P 500’s
coal and consumable fuel sub-industry index, trades for 15.3
times estimated earnings, while the ratio for  Peabody Energy
Corp. (BTU) , the largest U.S. producer of the commodity, is 9.7.  The  S&P 500 coal producers index  added 0.4 percent on March
23.  The deposits at Yakutugol are Mechel’s most profitable
asset, accounting for about 25 percent of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year,
according to  George Buzhenitsa , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG
in Moscow. They include the Elga coal field, Russia’s largest.  Mechel will get time to resolve the breaches at Yakutugol,
and the prospect of terminating licenses will only be
contemplated should the company fail to address the issues
raised, Yelena Koverga, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Ministry of
Natural Resources, said by phone on March 22. The ministry and
Mechel both declined to comment on the possibility of licensing
violations at South Kuzbass.  ‘Very Attractive’  “If Mechel loses their license, the whole sector will come
to a halt,” Boris Krasnojenov, a metals and mining analyst at
 Renaissance Capital , said by phone from Moscow. “The
probability of Mechel losing the license is very low. Below $10,
Mechel is very attractive for investors.”  Mechel may move an initial public offering of its coal and
iron-ore mining unit OAO Mechel-Mining to New York this year
after delaying a planned $2 billion sale in  London  in September,
three people with knowledge of the matter said in December,
declining to be identified because the information is
confidential. The parent company has traded on the New York
Stock Exchange since 2004.  Rusal Falls  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 2.2 percent to HK$5.69 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:39
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.2 percent
today amid concern earnings of Asian exporters are
deteriorating.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies
listed in New York added 1.6 percent to 108.12 on March 23,
curbing its loss last week to 2.8 percent. The  Market Vectors
Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that holds Russian shares, rose
for the first time in six days, gaining 1.7 percent to $31.34.
The exchange-traded fund tumbled 3.9 percent last week, the
biggest weekly drop since the five days ended Dec. 9.  ADRs of OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural gas
producer, rose 2.2 percent to $12.54 in New York on March 23,
reducing the weekly decline to 6.2 percent, the most since the
second week of December. The U.S.-listed stock traded at a 0.8
percent premium to Micex shares, which gained for the first time
in six days to 182.28 rubles, or $6.24.  No More Increases  Gazprom tumbled last week as  Alfa Bank  and Credit Suisse
Group AG said the state-controlled company’s tax burden will be
boosted to pay for President-elect Vladimir Putin’s election
promises to increase pensions and state-employee salaries. Taxes
for Gazprom, the nation’s gas export monopoly, may rise by as
much as $22 billion a year over the next five years, according
to Alfa’s worst-case scenario.  Coupled with the specter of higher taxation, Putin,
currently the prime minister, said on March 23 that there will
be no extra increases in Russian domestic natural-gas prices
this year for producers including Gazprom. Companies sought
additional tariff increases after Russia boosted extraction
taxes this year, Putin said in Kirishi, near  St. Petersburg .  “The discussion will end with some sort of compromise,”
said  Alexei Kokin , a senior oil and gas analyst at UralSib
Financial Corp. in Moscow. “Gazprom won’t get the tariff
increase it wants but will get some kind of compromise.”  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  climbed 0.7 percent to 1,540.97 on
March 23, paring its weekly slide to 4.8 percent. The RTS rose
0.9 percent to 1,668.41, its first increase in six days.  Sberbank Better Bet  The  RTS Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in
the index futures, slipped 1.1 percent in New York trading on
March 23 to 30.29.  OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) , Russia’s largest lender, may be a better bet
for stock investors than smaller rival VTB Group because it has
greater potential for growth and a higher-quality portfolio of
loans, Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Hugo Swann said in a
research note e-mailed on March 23.  Sberbank’s (SBRCY)  ADRs jumped 4.1 percent to $13.56 in New York on
March 23, the biggest one-day advance since Feb. 24, making it
the best performer on the Bloomberg Russia-US gauge.  Sberbank (SBER) 
rose 1.6 percent on the Micex to 97.50 rubles on March 23, or
the equivalent of $3.33.  VTB (VTBR) , the country’s second-biggest bank, added 3.3 percent
in London to $4.72, down 5.4 percent in the week.  Credit Suisse raised its target price on Sberbank’s Moscow
shares to $4.30 from $4.20 and cut VTB’s target price in London
to $5.10 from $5.50. The Zurich-based lender rates Sberbank the
equivalent of buy and VTB the equivalent of sell.  Crude oil climbed on March 23 after Reuters reported that
Iranian oil exports will drop by 300,000 barrels a day this
month because of tighter sanctions. Oil for May delivery
advanced 1.4 percent to $106.87 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , while Brent oil for May settlement gained
1.6 percent to $125.13 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Urals Crude, Russia’s chief export blend, rose 1.7
percent to $121.83, snapping a four-day drop.  To contact the reporters on this story:
