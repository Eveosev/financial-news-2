Cincinnati Reds  closer Ryan Madson
will have season-ending surgery to repair the ligament in his
right elbow, four months after his four-year $44 million deal
with the  Philadelphia Phillies  collapsed.  Madson, 31, agreed in January to a one-year Major League
Baseball contract guaranteeing $8.5 million with the Reds. His
negotiations with the Phillies ended in November after the
National League team signed  Jonathan Papelbon  to a four-year $50
million deal.  Madson reported pain in his elbow at the start of spring
training and dismissed it as an annual discomfort. He didn’t
pitch any exhibition games. After throwing for batting practice
five days ago, he experienced tightness in his elbow.  “He obviously feels terrible about it,” Reds General
Manager Walt Jocketty said on the team’s website. “He felt fine
all spring until recently. After his last session the other day,
it got real tight. Even before he left yesterday, he said he
felt fine. Obviously, he wasn’t.”  Dr. Timothy Kremchek, the team medical director, told
Jocketty yesterday that bleeding made it appear that the tear
was recent. No date was set for the so-called Tommy John
surgery.  Madson saved 32 games in 34 chances last year for the
Phillies and was to have replaced Francisco Cordero as the Reds’
closer.  “You feel terrible for him because he feels terrible,”
Reds manager  Dusty Baker  said. “There’s nothing we can do about
it now. We know the problem. Now we have to come up with a
solution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
