Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said spending cuts in his government’s March 29 budget
will fall “within the expectations” his party set during the
last general election in May.  “The actions the government will be taking will be within
the expectations we set during the election campaign,” Harper
told reporters at a news conference today in  Tokyo .  The government said in its budget last March that it would
seek to cut spending by as much as C$4 billion ($4 billion)
annually.  “We’ll also be making some very significant investments in
changes to ensure the growth of the Canadian economy in the
future to ensure that we continue to create jobs and that we
have long-term prosperity and sustainability of our social
programs,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
