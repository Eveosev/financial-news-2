Google Inc. (GOOG)  was ordered by the
Tokyo District Court to suspend its autocomplete search function
after a man alleged that it violated his privacy, according to a
Kyodo News story published on the Japan Times website.  Google refused to suspend the feature, saying that its U.S.
headquarters isn’t regulated by Japanese law, according to the
 report .  The  Mountain View , California-based company, owner of the
world’s most popular search engine, is reviewing the order,
according to an e-mailed statement from Google to Bloomberg
News.  “A Japanese court issued a provisional order requesting
Google to delete specific terms from autocomplete,” the company
said. “The judge did not require Google to completely suspend
the autocomplete function.”  Autocomplete predicts searches for users as they start
typing queries, in part by using the popularity of search terms,
the company said. Google said it doesn’t determine these terms
manually -- suggested queries are drawn from items that have
been typed in by other Google users.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
