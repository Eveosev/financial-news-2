Germany ’s opposition Social
Democrats demand measures to promote growth, ensure taxation of
financial markets and reduce youth unemployment as conditions
for supporting new euro-area budget rules, the party’s
parliamentary leader Frank-Walter Steinmeier told  Bild .  The party will only support the fiscal pact “if it is
economically reasonable and fair,” Germany’s biggest tabloid
quoted Steinmeier as saying in an e-mailed preview of an
interview to be published tomorrow. “We won’t sign a blank
check.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
