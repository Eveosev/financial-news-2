U.K. opposition leader  Ed Miliband 
has overtaken Conservative Prime Minister  David Cameron  in an
ICM poll after Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s
budget kept a planned fuel duty increase and froze pensioners’
tax allowances.  The poll, commissioned by the Sunday Telegraph newspaper,
showed 38 percent of voters would back Labour in a general
election, a two-point gain, while support for the Conservatives
fell two points to 37 percent.  Sixty-three percent of respondents said they opposed moves
to tax pensioners more, while 47 percent said they felt worse
off after Osborne announced his budget on March 21, the survey
showed. Some 88 percent opposed Osborne’s plan to go ahead with
higher fuel duties.  ICM surveyed 1,000 people by telephone on March 22 and
March 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
