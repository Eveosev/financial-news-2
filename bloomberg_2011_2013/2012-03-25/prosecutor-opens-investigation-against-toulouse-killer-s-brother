The Paris prosecutor formally
opened today an investigation against Abdelkader Merah, the
brother of the man who killed seven people in and around
Toulouse, on charges of complicity in the murders and the
financing of terrorism, his office said in a statement.  The prosecutor said “serious and corresponding signs”
showed Merah, 29, may have helped his brother Mohamed Merah in
the killings. Between March 11 and 19, Mohamed Merah killed
three paratroopers, three children and one teacher at a Jewish
school. He was shot dead by the police on March 21.  Abdelkader Merah’s wife and the men’s mother were freed by
the prosecutor who said that “at this point” of the
investigation the prosecution had no charges to be held against
them, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
