Spain â€™s PP probably won 52 to 55
seats in the 109-seat Andalusian parliament in regional
elections today, Canal Sur reported, citing an exit poll.  For an outright majority, 55 seats are needed. The PP
likely won 42 percent of the vote, against 39.2 percent for the
Socialists, the broadcaster said on its website, citing the
IPSOS poll.  The Socialists may have won 45 to 48 seats and United Left,
which has ruled in coalition with the Socialists in previous
administrations, may have won eight to 10 seats, the poll
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
