China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the
world’s second-largest lender by market value, posted a 24
percent increase in fourth-quarter profit after higher lending
and fee income outweighed provisions set aside for bad debt.  Net income climbed to 30.2 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) in
the quarter, from 24.4 billion yuan, according to calculations
based on full-year figures published by the Beijing-based lender
yesterday. That compared with the 31.4 billion-yuan  average
estimate  of 22 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Construction Bank joins smaller rival China Minsheng
Banking Corp. in posting higher earnings after a credit shortage
drove up  interest rates , boosting loan profitability. Still,
curbs on borrowing by local governments, property developers and
homebuyers are triggering bad debts as the lender has more
assets at risk from these clients than most of its peers.  “We forecast earnings growth will slow from the very
robust 25 percent in 2011 to 10 percent in 2012 as credit costs
rise, loan growth decelerates and net interest margins contract
in the second half,”  Mike Werner , a Hong Kong-based analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said in a research report today.  Chinese lenders advanced 7.47 trillion yuan of  new loans 
last year, 6 percent less than the amount offered in 2010. That
helped boost weighted-average lending rates to 8.01 percent in
December, up 1.82 percentage points from the beginning of the
year, according to the central bank.  Shares of Construction Bank fell 1.2 percent to close at
HK$5.92 in  Hong Kong , limiting its gains this year to 9.2
percent.  Wider Margin  Construction Bank made 827 billion yuan of new loans in
2011, taking the total to 6.5 trillion yuan. Its net interest
margin widened to 2.7 percent from 2.5 percent a year earlier,
according to yesterday’s statement.  China  relaxed lenders’ reserve requirements twice since the
start of December and scrapped bill sales this year to ease a
cash crunch that was stifling growth in the world’s second-
biggest economy. Gross domestic product expanded 8.9 percent in
the fourth quarter, or at the slowest pace in more than two
years.  Construction Bank lent a total of 150 billion yuan in the
first two months of 2012, Vice President Chen Zuofu said in Hong
Kong today. The bank plans to increase lending by about 12
percent this year, according to yesterday’s statement.  Non-Performing Loans  Construction Bank’s non-performing loans rose 6.3 billion
yuan in the fourth quarter to 70.9 billion yuan as of Dec. 31,
accounting for 1.09 percent of the portfolio. The bank set aside
15 billion yuan against soured debt during the period, 10
percent less than a year earlier.  The lender is “fully prepared” for market volatility,
Chief Risk Officer Huang Zhiling told reporters today, adding
that bad loans will be “stable” and “relatively low” this
year.  “For years there are lots of international worries on
what’s going on in China, yet China comes out fine,” Frank Newman, chairman of Promontory Financial Group China Ltd. and
former chairman of  Shenzhen Development Bank Co. (000001) , said on
Bloomberg TV on March 23. “The government does not want to have
a big banking problem this year or next year, and there are a
lot of things they can do in terms of extending loans,
rearranging government financing.”  Property Bubble  China is trying to spur credit to smaller companies while
limiting home loans that could create a property bubble. In a
March 5 speech in Beijing, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the
government will “strictly implement” restrictions.  Fourth-quarter profit at Construction Bank was derived by
subtracting nine-month figures from the 2011 earnings reported
yesterday. The company posted a 26 percent increase in net
income in 2011 to 169.3 billion yuan, according to the
statement.  Net interest income rose 21 percent to 304.6 billion yuan
in 2011. Fee income from services such as credit cards and trade
finance advanced 32 percent to 87 billion yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
