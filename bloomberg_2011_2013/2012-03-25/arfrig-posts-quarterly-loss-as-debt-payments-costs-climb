Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) ,  Latin
America ’s second-largest beef producer, reported a  fourth-
quarter  loss after a surge in animal-feed costs and debt
payments eroded gains.  The net loss of 141.5 million reais ($78.2 million)
compares with a profit of 158.1 million reais in the year-
earlier period, Sao Paulo-based Marfrig said in a regulatory
filing.  The company was expected to post a loss of 7.6 million
reais, excluding some items, according to the average of four
analyst estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg.  JBS SA (JBSS3)  is the world’s largest beef producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
