New York’s 15 Asia Week auctions
tallied $140.4 million, with classical Chinese painting and
calligraphy commanding the highest prices.  Sotheby’s (BID)  four sales raised $61.8 million, surpassing the
presale high estimate of $41.4 million.  Christie’s
International’s (CHRS)  seven auctions took $69 million, in the middle
of the targeted range. Three auctions at Bonhams brought in $5.8
million, better than forecasted. Doyle New York posted the
smallest result, $3.8 million, squeezing past the low estimate.  Here are the top results of the week:  Sotheby’s  In a quiet Sotheby’s salesroom filled with Chinese bidders,
a group of eight calligraphy scripts by the 12th and 13th-
century Southern Song emperors surged to $5.7 million, the
highest price of the week and more than five times the lot’s
high estimate of $1 million.  Two Qianlong-era revolving Famille-Rose porcelain brush-
pots, depicting heaven and earth, tallied $3.5 million. One was
estimated at $120,000 to $150,000 and soared to $1.9 million.
The other had an $80,000-$120,000 estimate and sold for $1.5
million.  The  Metropolitan Museum  of Art helped push the price for an
album featuring 17th century ink drawings of Yellow Mountain,
“Eight Views of Huangshan,” to $2.3 million, about 10 times the 
presale estimate.  Christie’s  A 13th-century Nepalese gilt bronze figure of Padmapani, a
Buddhist divinity, soared to $2.5 million at  Christie’s , more
than its presale estimate of $250,000 to $350,000. The work came
from the collection of art dealer Doris Wiener.  A silvery bronze Tang dynasty (618-907) mirror from the
collection of Robert H. Ellsworth fetched $482,500, three times
the high estimate. It was one of 70 bronze mirrors consigned by
Ellsworth, a major Asian art collector and dealer, who began
buying them more than 60 years ago.  Bonhams  A dazzling 1808 harem scene by Indian artist Bagta,
purchased for $125 in 1991, fetched $302,500 at  Bonhams , 10
times the low estimate of $30,000. The signed miniature was
previously unrecorded. Bagta’s work was recently on display at
the Met’s “Wonder of the Age, Master Painters of  India , 1100-
1900”  exhibition .  Doyle  A 17th-century Chinese bronze cannon sold for $362,500 at
Doyle, falling short of low estimate of $400,000 despite its
provenance. Commissioned by Emperor Kangxi and dated 1695, the
cannon was captured during the Boxer Rebellion and brought to
the U.S. by Colonel Webb C. Hayes, son of President Rutherford
B. Hayes.  Casualties  One of the biggest disappointments at Christie’s was a
16th-century gilt-bronze Buddha statue which weighed almost a
ton and was estimated to bring $2 million to $3 million. It
found no buyers.  At Sotheby’s, a 1958 painting by Syed Haider Raza,
“Village with Church,” which once belonged to John D. Rockefeller III and his wife, Blanchette, also flopped. It had a
presale estimate of $1.5 million to $2.5 million.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
