Estonia  should join the permanent
euro rescue fund as the country addresses risks threatening the
European economy, Estonia’s Central Bank Governor  Andres Lipstok 
said.  The  Supreme Court  of the newest euro-area country is due to
rule before July, on request from Justice Chancellor Indrek
Teder, on whether the founding treaty of the European Stability
Mechanism breaches the Baltic nation’s constitution.  “It is beneficial for Estonia to fully implement the EU’s
strong financial stability framework,” Lipstok, also a member
of the European Central Bank Governing Council, wrote in an
opinion piece for the  Postimees  newspaper today. “Assistance is
provided not to help out single countries, but to solve crises
that are systemic and endanger the economy of the entire  Europe ,
including Estonia,” he wrote. Lipstok urged the court to give a
“fast and finite” assessment on the issue.  Teder said on March 12 a clause in the ESM treaty that
allows a decision on financial assistance to member states to be
made with an 85 percent qualified majority violates Estonia’s
constitution. The treaty, signed Feb. 2 in Brussels, has yet to
be ratified by Estonia’s parliament. Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said this month the treaty has a mechanism addressing
Teder’s concerns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
