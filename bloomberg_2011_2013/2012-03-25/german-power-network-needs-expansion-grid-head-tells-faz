Germany ’s shift away from nuclear
power may hit a snag if the country doesn’t expand its energy
network more quickly, Jochen Homann, the head of the country’s
Network Agency, told  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung .  The country may not be able to meet the necessary
requirements by 2015, the newspaper quoted Homann as saying in
an e-mailed preview of an article to be published tomorrow. The
country also needs to link up new offshore wind parks, FAZ
quoted him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
