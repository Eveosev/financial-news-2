Egypt  received U.S. and Israeli
approval to expand its Qualified Industrial Zones into the
southern part of the country, Industry and Foreign Trade
Minister Mahmoud Eissa said today.  Eissa said in an interview in Cairo that a U.S. trade
delegation is slated to visit the country in the first half of
April to discuss the expansion of the areas commonly known as
QIZs.  He said textile exports from the zones, in which companies
are granted duty free access to U.S. markets, last year amounted
to $1.3 billion, an increase of about 10 to 15 percent from
2010.  To operate from the QIZ, about 10 percent of a
participating companyâ€™s product must originate from  Israel .  To contact the reporter on this story Abdel Latif Wahba in Cairo
