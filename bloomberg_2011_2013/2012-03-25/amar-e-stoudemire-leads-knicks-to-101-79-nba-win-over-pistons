Bulls. Detroit (16-32) is 23 games behind the leader.  Carmelo Anthony had 15 points and Tyson Chandler added 15
points and 17 rebounds for the Knicks, who had a 49-37 halftime
advantage last night on their home court at Madison Square
Garden.  Ben Gordon led the Pistons with 20 points, while Greg Monroe had 12 points for the Pistons who have lost five straight
