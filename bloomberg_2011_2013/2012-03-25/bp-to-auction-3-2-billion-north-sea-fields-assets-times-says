  BP Plc (BP/)  started its biggest auction
of North Sea fields, putting up assets valued at 2 billion
pounds ($3.2 billion) after the U.K. offered tax breaks for the
industry, the Sunday Times  reported .  In a separate deal, Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration
Co. may buy  Ithaca Energy Inc. (IAE) , the newspaper reported. Both
potential deals follow the U.K.â€™s decision to cover as much as
75 percent of clean-up costs for old fields, it reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
