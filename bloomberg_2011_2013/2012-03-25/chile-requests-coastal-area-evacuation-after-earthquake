Chile’s government emergency office
requested the evacuation of coastal areas after a 7.2 magnitude
earthquake struck in the  Pacific Ocean  off Constitucino, a
village south of Santiago that was destroyed by a tsunami in
2010.  The quake probably won’t lead to a tsunami, the Navy’s
hydrographic service reported, according to Radio Cooperativa  To contact the reporter on this story:
