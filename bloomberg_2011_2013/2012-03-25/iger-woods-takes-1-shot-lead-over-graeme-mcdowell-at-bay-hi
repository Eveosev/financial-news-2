Tiger Woods  holds a four-shot lead
through 14 holes of his final round at golf’s Arnold Palmer
Invitational, where he’s seeking his first victory in 2 1/2
years in a full-field U.S. PGA Tour tournament.  Woods, playing in his final event before next month’s
 Masters Tournament , is 2-under par for today’s round at the Bay
Hill Club and Lodge in  Orlando ,  Florida . He’s made four birdies
and two bogeys to get to 13-under for the tournament, with
Graeme McDowell in second place at 9 under par.  Woods bogeyed the par-3 second hole, while playing partner
McDowell, the 2010 U.S. Open champion, dropped to 8-under after
beginning with a double bogey.  McDowell sank a 45-foot (13.7 meter) birdie putt at No. 3
and Woods birdied that hole and the next before McDowell scored
eagle from about 51 feet at the par-5 sixth to advance to 11-
under. Woods tapped in for birdie at No. 6 and moved to 14-under
with another birdie at the eighth hole.  The advantage stretched to four shots when McDowell, from
 Northern Ireland , missed a short putt for par at the ninth hole
to drop back to 10-under. McDowell again pulled within three
shots with a birdie at No. 11 before dropping back to 10-under
again at the next.  Both players made bogeys at the par-3 14th hole.  Woods, who has won the event six times, has 37 wins against
two losses when he’s gone into the final round in the lead. His
71st and last victory on the tour came at the BMW Championship
on Sept. 13, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
