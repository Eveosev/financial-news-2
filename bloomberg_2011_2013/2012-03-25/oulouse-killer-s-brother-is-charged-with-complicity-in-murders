Abdelkader Merah, the brother of
the man who killed seven people in and around Toulouse this
month, was formally indicted by an anti-terror judge on charges
of complicity in the murders, Elisabeth Allannic, a spokeswoman
for the Paris prosecutor, said.  Merah, 29, is also charged with theft and participation in
a terrorist act, she said. The preliminary charges were filed
after Merah’s interrogation by the judge, Allannic said. His
younger brother, Mohamed Merah, 23, committed the murders and
was shot dead by police on March 21 after a 32-hour siege of his
house in Toulouse.  Abdelkader Merah is charged with complicity in the murders
committed by his brother on March 11, 15 and 19, of three
paratroopers, and three children and a teacher at a Jewish
school. He is also charged in connection with the attempted
murder of another soldier and a child who survived the killings,
Allannic said. He is being held in an undisclosed location, she
added.  Today, the Paris prosecutor opened an investigation against
Merah, saying that “serious and corresponding signs” showed
Merah may have helped his brother Mohamed Merah in the killings,
according to an e-mailed statement. Abdelkader Merah was
arrested on March 20.  His wife and mother were freed by the prosecutor, who said
that “at this point” there are no charges against them,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
