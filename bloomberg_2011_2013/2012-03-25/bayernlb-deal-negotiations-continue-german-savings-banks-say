Bavaria’s savings banks said that
talks are continuing on a deal to restructure  Bayerische
Landesbank (BLGZ) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest state-owned lender, in
return for European Union approval of its bailout.  “The negotiations on the role of savings banks in
BayernLB’s restructuring are still ongoing,” Theo Zellner,
president of the Bavarian Savings Bank Association, said today
in an e-mailed statement. “The talks have not broken down,” he
said.  German savings banks have backtracked on an agreement over
their level of contributions to a restructuring plan that would
have included the sale of BayernLB’s LBS Bayern mortgage lending
unit, a person familiar with the matter said yesterday.  Their withdrawal might endanger a deal with EU Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia , who told the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
earlier this month that EU officials were close to an agreement
with the bank’s owners, which include the German state of
Bavaria, on the terms for EU approval of BayernLB’s bailout.  The European Commission has required banks to shrink
balance sheets and sell off assets to compensate for the harm to
competition arising from state aid. As a last resort, it can
force authorities to recoup the aid they have provided.  To contact the reporters on this story:
