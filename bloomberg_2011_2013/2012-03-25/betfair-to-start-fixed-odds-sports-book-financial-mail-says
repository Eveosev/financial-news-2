Betfair Group Plc (BET) , an online
betting exchange, will start taking bets of its own by
introducing a fixed-odds sports book, the Financial Mail said,
citing interim Chief Executive Officer Stephen Morana.  “There are certain bets at certain times that the
exchange, by its nature, cannot offer,” the London newspaper
reported Morana as saying. “Some of our customers are going to
traditional bookies for a portion of their betting and we hope
to address this with the introduction of an integrated risk
product that will complement the exchange, not compete with
it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
