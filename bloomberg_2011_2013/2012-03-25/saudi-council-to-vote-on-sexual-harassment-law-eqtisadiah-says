Saudi Arabia â€™s consultative Shoura
Council will vote this month on a sexual harassment law, which
will have flogging as a penalty,  al-Eqtisadiah  said, citing
council member Sadaqa Fadel.  The law will also include warnings, fines and jail
sentences for sexual harassment offenses, the Riyadh-based
