(Corrects to add dropped word in headline.)  Egypt said it had foreign direct
investment outflows of $482.7 million in 2011 compared with
inflows of $6.4 billion a year earlier after the popular
uprising that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak .  The Arab country registered a balance of payments deficit
of $18.3 billion in 2011 compared with a surplus of $1.3 billion
in 2010, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement today.
Remittances rose to $14.3 billion from $12.5 billion in 2010, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
