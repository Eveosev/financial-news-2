Andrew Haldane , the Bank of
England’s executive director for financial stability, said banks
should shore up their capital as market conditions improve.  “Our message to the banks this week was to build their
defenses,” Haldane said in an interview with  Sky News  today.
“It’s not true to say that some banks at least couldn’t raise
external funds to buttress their seawalls. The financial markets
are somewhat better than a few months ago and the European
situation has normalized to a degree.”  Haldane said that the Financial Policy Committee recognized
banking bonuses had already been cut “somewhat,” though banks
need to focus on building up capital buffers for extra
protection. The committee on March 23 said the outlook for
financial stability remains “fragile,” as it made a
recommendation to the government on the tools it needs to help
strengthen banks.  “The world remains a risky place,” Haldane told Sky. “If
you are to put in place some extra protection now, the  capital
markets  will reward you.”  Haldane also said the  European Central Bank ’s measures to
provide loans to banks haven’t replaced the need for structural
reforms.  “What the ECB has done is provided liquidity to buy time”
while structural reforms are carried out, he said. “As a
solution, it’s a sticking plaster.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
