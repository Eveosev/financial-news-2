Pope Benedict XVI  urged people to
protect and care for children, calling them the generations to
come.  “I invite all to protect and care for children so their
smile can never fade,” Pope Benedict XVI said today in downtown
Guanajuato, Mexico. “You, my little friends, are not alone”,
he said.  “Pray for everyone, even for me,” the pope said speaking
before about 4,000 children in the Peace Plaza. “I’ll pray for
you and for Mexico to be a place where all its sons will live
with serenity and harmony,” he said.  The pope was met yesterday at the airport of Guanajuato
state by President Felipe Calderon. Pope Benedict XVI is
spending three days in  Mexico  before travelling to Cuba on March
26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
