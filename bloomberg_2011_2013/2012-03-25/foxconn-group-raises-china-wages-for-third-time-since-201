Foxconn Technology Group (FOXCGZ)  is hiring
production workers in Taiyuan city of  China ’s northern Shanxi
province as it prepares to make  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5, the
Morning Life Post reported on March 21, citing a Foxconn local
employee surnamed Yu.  Foxconn, which is trying to bridge a shortage of about
20,000 workers, obtained orders for about 57 million units of
iPhone 5 a year, the Shanxi-based  newspaper  said, citing Yu.  Foxconn faces “unprecedented” demand for labor as it
expands production in China, the paper said, citing a company
employee in charge of hiring whom it identified by the last name
Zhang.  Foxconn’s Taipei-based spokesman Simon Hsing didn’t answer
three phone calls seeking comments.  Link to newspaper:
