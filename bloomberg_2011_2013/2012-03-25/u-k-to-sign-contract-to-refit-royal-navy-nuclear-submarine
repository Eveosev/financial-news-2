The U.K. will sign a 350 million-
pound ($555 million) contract to refit and refuel one of the
Royal Navy’s nuclear deterrent submarines, the Ministry of
Defence said.  Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will announce the three-
and-a-half year contract to refit and refuel HMS Vengeance,
sustaining 2,000 jobs, at a visit to Devonport Dockyard in
Plymouth today, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  “As well as securing 2,000 U.K. jobs, this contract will
ensure the nuclear deterrent submarine fleet can continue to
operate safely and effectively to maintain a continuous at sea
deterrent,” Hammond will say, according to prepared remarks
released by his office. “As we stabilise the defence budget we
are increasingly able to commit to equipment projects to
safeguard the U.K.’s national security.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
