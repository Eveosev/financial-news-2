Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  may sell its
freight fleet if a ban on night flights at the Frankfurt airport
is upheld,  Focus  magazine reported, citing Karl Ulrich Garnadt,
the head of the company’s cargo unit.  A ban on flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. will reduce
Lufthansa’s sales by a triple-digit million-euro figure this
year, the magazine said in an e-mailed preview of the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
