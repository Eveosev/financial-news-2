Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  will
inevitably need to increase fuel prices, Folha de Sao Paulo
reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Maria
das Gracas Foster.  Petrobras, as the oil company is known, will have to raise
fuel prices if  Brent crude  continues to trade over $120 per
barrel, Foster told the Sao Paulo-based newspaper. Petrobras has
strong enough financial margins to compensate for the lack of
increases for several months, Foster said, according to Folha.  Brazil’s government caps Petrobras’s fuel prices in order
to fight inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
