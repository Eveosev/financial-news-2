Brazil â€™s government is analyzing
whether to allow  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  to boost fuel prices, O
Estado de Sao Paulo reported, citing an interview with Mines and
Energy Minister Edison Lobao.  A price increase is more likely because inflation is lower
this year than in previous years, Lobao told the Sao Paulo-based
daily newspaper. The decision is up to President  Dilma Rousseff ,
Lobao said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
