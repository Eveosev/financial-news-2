Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
has defied chart watchers by gaining 11 percent since Feb. 14,
even as a technical measure of momentum signaled prices would
drop the last month. Gains may continue, if history is any guide.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks Japan’s benchmark equities
gauge against instances where its relative strength index, a
measure of price momentum, moved above the 70 level that some
traders see as a signal to sell. The Nikkei has exceeded that
threshold on 24 of the last 27 days, the most since 2005.
Whenever the RSI reached 77 or more since 1991, the index
advanced 9 percent on average in the next 90 trading days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Applying the same criteria, the Nikkei may gain 3.3 percent
to 10,339 by the end of June, extending a rally that accelerated
on Feb. 14 when the  Bank of Japan  unexpectedly added 10 trillion
yen ($121 billion) to an asset-purchase program to boost the
economy. In 2005 the Nikkei advanced 19 percent in the 90
trading days after the RSI first crossed above 77 on Nov 18.  “There is usually a lag between when the RSI tops out and
when the Nikkei peaks,” said Yutaka Miura, senior technical
analyst at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The market
continued to rise back in 2005 and shares may keep advancing
this time, too.”  Even when the RSI signals overheating, stocks tend to climb
as long trading turnover increases, Miura said. The average
daily value of shares changing hands on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
has risen to 1.40 trillion yen this month from 1.34 trillion yen
in February, Bloomberg data show. The average was 852 billion
yen in December.  The relative strength index is a momentum indicator that
compares the size of recent gains and losses to determine
whether an asset is overbought or oversold. A level 70 or above
signals overheating to some traders, while a level below 30
indicates an asset’s price may be poised to rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
