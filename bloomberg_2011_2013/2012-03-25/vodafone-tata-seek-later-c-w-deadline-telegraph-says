Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Tata
Communications Ltd. (TCOM)  want to extend the March 29 deadline to bid
for  Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/) , the Sunday Telegraph said,
without saying how it got the information.  UBS AG (UBSN) , representing Vodafone, and  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) 
and  Morgan Stanley (MS) , working for Tata, will ask for a later
deadline because C&W hasn’t provided enough information to the
bidders yet, the newspaper reported.  Will Cameron, a spokesman for C&W, and Matt Peacock, a
Vodafone spokesman, declined to comment. Natalie Chak, a London-
based spokeswoman for Tata Communications, couldn’t immediately
be reached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
