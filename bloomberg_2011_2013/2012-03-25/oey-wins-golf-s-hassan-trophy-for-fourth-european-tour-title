Northern Ireland ’s Michael Hoey hit
a second straight 7-under-par round to win golf’s Hassan Trophy
in Morocco for his fourth title on the European Tour.  Hoey finished on 17-under 271, three shots ahead of
Ireland’s Damien McGrane, with Welshmen Jamie Donaldson and
Phillip Price, and Robert Coles of England another stroke back.  The 33-year-old collects a check for 250,000 euros
($331,700). He won his first title at the Estoril Open in 2009
and had victories in the Madeira Islands Open and Alfred Dunhill
Links Championship last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
