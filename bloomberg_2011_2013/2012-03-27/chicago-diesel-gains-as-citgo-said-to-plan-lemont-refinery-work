Chicago  diesel rose to the highest
level in more than two weeks as Citgo Petroleum Corp. was said
to be planning the shutdown of most production units at the
Lemont refinery in Illinois next month.  Work at the 170,500-barrel-a-day plant may last until the
first week in June, said a person familiar with refinery
operations who declined to be identified because he is not
authorized to speak for the plant. The equipment includes a
crude unit, coker, fluid catalytic cracker and alkylation unit,
the person said.  The differential for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  Chicago (CHCGUTLS) 
strengthened 6.5 cents to parity with heating oil futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:14 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained 5.43 cents to
$3.2353 a gallon.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  widened 0.13 cent versus futures to 13.88 cents a
gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
