Portugal ’s sale of  Banco Portugues
de Negocios SA (BPDN)  to Banco BIC Portugues SA of Angola will be
completed Friday after the lender’s bailout and restructuring
was approved by European Union regulators.  The  Portuguese government  will sign the contract to sell
BPN on March 30, the  finance ministry  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The European Commission earlier today approved
BPN’s restructuring plan, including the sale to Banco BIC. BPN
was seized by the Portuguese government in 2008.  Banco BIC, based in Luanda, offered to buy BPN for 40
million euros ($53 million), a fraction of its 180 million-euro
asking price.  In return for EU approval for BPN’s rescue, Portugal
promised to set a limit on BPN’s core tier 1 capital and adjust
liquidity lines requested by Banco BIC to be granted by the
state-owned  Caixa Geral de Depositos . BPN must also refrain from
acquisitions and dividends and from exercising call option
rights for subordinated bond holders until the end of 2016.  EU regulators must approve large government subsidies to
banks and have required lenders to sell off assets to compensate
for harm to competition.  To contact the reporters on this story:
