Ford Motor Co. (F) , which sells more
than three out of every 10 vehicles to fleet buyers, has boosted
its share of U.S. fleet market to 27 percent, from 22 percent
five years ago.  “It’s a very productive and profitable business,” Kevin
Koswick, director of Ford’s North American fleet, lease and
remarketing operations, said today in  Detroit  in a speech to the
Automotive Press Association. “It’s something that’s good for
our business.”  Ford sold 675,901 cars and trucks to fleet buyers last
year, according to Koswick. About 41 percent of those vehicles
went to daily rental companies, which buy in bulk and typically
pay less than individual customers. Ford depends less on sales
to rental companies than  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Chrysler Group,
LLC and attempts to take a “balanced” approach to protect
resale values, Koswick said.  “We’re very disciplined about what we want to do,”
Koswick said in response to a question about the stigma of the
rental lot hurting resale values of Ford models. “I don’t see
it as an issue as long as you manage your fleet and you’re
balanced in what you do.”  Koswick valued the industrywide U.S. fleet business,
including government and commercial sales, at $57 billion last
year. Ford and other U.S. automakers have attempted to back away
from rental-car sales, which generate lower profit margins.  Ford slid 1.3 percent to $12.32 at the close in  New York .  Ford Share  The second-largest U.S. automaker sold 15 percent of its
vehicles to rental companies in February and 17 percent to
commercial and government fleets, according to Erich Merkle, the
company’s sales analyst. Last year, 13 percent of Ford’s U.S.
sales went to rental-car companies, Koswick said.  So far this year, Ford’s fleet deliveries have accounted
for 31 percent of its total U.S. vehicle sales, down from 33
percent a year earlier, Merkle said.  Ford’s share of the U.S. fleet market, which includes
government and commercial purchases, has grown as the total
market has declined, according to data Koswick presented during
his speech.  Automakers sold 3.3 million vehicles to U.S. fleet buyers
in 2007, with Ford accounting for 725,351, or 22 percent, of
those sales. Last year, Ford had 27 percent of the U.S. fleet
market, which totaled 2.5 million vehicles, according to
Koswick.  Ford’s fleet sales rose 10 percent last year, while its
total U.S. sales gained 11 percent. Ford’s market share rose to
16.8 percent last year, from 16.7 percent in 2010. That was the
third consecutive annual U.S. market share gain for Ford, which
hadn’t happened since the early 1970s, the company said.  Ford’s Comeback  In the first two months of this year, Ford’s U.S. sales of
cars and light trucks rose 11 percent, while industrywide sales
gained 14 percent. The automaker’s U.S. market share so far this
year has fallen to 15.3 percent from 15.6 percent in the same
period last year, according to researcher Autodata Corp. of
 Woodcliff Lake ,  New Jersey .  Ford, based in Dearborn,  Michigan , on Jan. 27 reported its
 11th consecutive  profitable quarter, with net income of $13.6
billion, or $3.40 a share, compared with $190 million, or 5
cents, a year earlier. Ford earned $29.5 billion in the last
three years after $30.1 billion in losses from 2006 through
2008.  Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally , 66, turned around the
automaker by globalizing operations, cutting costs, improving
quality and expanding the lineup with fuel-efficient models such
as the Fiesta subcompact.  To contact the reporter on this story:
