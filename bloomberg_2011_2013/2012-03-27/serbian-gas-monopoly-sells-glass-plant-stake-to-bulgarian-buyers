Serbian state-owned gas monopoly
 Srbijagas  sold its 63.6 percent stake in  Srpska Fabrika Stakla
AD (SFSP)  to Rubin AD, a Bulgarian glassmaker, for 35 million euros
($46.7 million).  The acquisition is backed by Bulgaria’s  Corporate
Commercial Bank AD (6C9) , Srbijagas general manager Dusan Bajatovic
said at a news conference in the capital Belgrade today after
signing the contract.  The Bulgarian buyer will invest an additional 22 million
euros over the next year to expand production of glass
packaging, mainly beer bottles in the facility in Paracin, 155
kilometers (96 miles) south of Belgrade. It plans to triple the
output within a year to an annual 120,000 tons of glass.  Rubin is also taking over Srpska Fabrika Stakla’s 10
million-euro debt to Serbian lender  Agrobanka AD (AGBN)  and to the
Serbian unit of  Hungary ’s OTP Banka, he said.  The company plans to dismiss some of its 1,700 workers
offering those who want to leave 300 euros per each year of past
service, Bajatovic said. The dismissals will cost an additional
4.5 million euros, with the government contributing 50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
