TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corp. (1893Q) 
protested its loss of a $20.5 billion military contract to
 UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , saying the nation’s largest health
insurer has a record of poor performance and legal issues.  The U.S. Department of Defense made an “inexplicable
decision” to award the contract to UnitedHealth, “a company
with a long history of performance problems and legal issues,
and with no history of providing health care to the military,”
David McIntyre Jr., TriWest’s chief executive officer, said in a
statement yesterday.  TriWest’s bid was lower than UnitedHealth’s offer and also
included “several hundred million dollars” in discounts that
the government failed to include in its review, McIntyre said
during a conference call with reporters today. The company’s
protest was filed yesterday with the Government Accountability
Office, which arbitrates contract disputes.  The U.S. Defense Department’s health program, called
Tricare, on March 16 awarded the contract to UnitedHealth after
initially choosing TriWest in 2009. UnitedHealth, based in
 Minnetonka ,  Minnesota , had persuaded the Pentagon last year to
reconsider.  AMA Lawsuit  UnitedHealth’s legal issues include an American Medical
Association lawsuit against the company, McIntyre said. The
lawsuit filed in 2000 alleged the insurer manipulated payments
to out-of-network doctors. UnitedHealth announced in January
2009 it would pay $350 million to settle the suit, which sought
damages for the physicians.  The Pentagon only consulted five references provided by
UnitedHealth in its review of the company’s track record,
McIntyre said. Tricare officials should have done more to
examine the company’s prior performance, such as contacting
insurance commissions in states where UnitedHealth operates and
reviewing the insurer’s public financial documents, he said.  “It’s a little like buying a house without an
inspection,” McIntyre said.  Bonnie Powell, a spokeswoman for the military health
program, declined to comment today on McIntyre’s allegations.  UnitedHealth also tried to “cut a deal” with TriWest
before the award to avoid competing for the work, McIntyre said.
He said TriWest wasn’t interested in such an arrangement.  “That was not proper in my opinion,” he said.  ‘Ungrounded Assertions’  Matt Stearns, a UnitedHealth spokesman, declined to comment
on whether the insurer had approached TriWest prior to the
award.  “It’s typical for an incumbent who has lost an award to
claim the process is unfair,” Stearns said in a phone interview
today. “But we are disappointed in TriWest’s ungrounded public
assertions, which will only cause beneficiary and provider
confusion.”  The company’s legal woes are “no more or less than any
other insurer,”  Ana Gupte , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
& Co. in  New York , said in an e-mail yesterday.  UnitedHealth is a “very strong, high-quality health
benefits provider,” said Gupte, who has an outperform rating on
the stock.  UnitedHealth rose 33 cents, or less than 1 percent, to
$55.43 in New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares have
increased 9.4 percent this year, compared with a 12.3 percent
gain by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The GAO has until July 5 to make a decision about the
protest, Ralph O. White, the agency’s managing associate general
counsel for procurement law, said in an e-mail.  ‘Only Business’  Closely held TriWest, based in Phoenix, risks losing what
founder McIntyre has called its “only business.” The company
has helped manage the military’s health services for the past 16
years. The work has generated more than $20 billion in contracts
for the company since fiscal 2000, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg Government.  “It is likely if we weren’t doing this work anymore, we
would shut down the corporation,” McIntyre said in today’s
conference call.  UnitedHealth is scheduled to take over the contract in
April 1, 2013, managing care for active-duty military, retirees
and their families in 21 states, mostly in the West. It would
become one of Tricare’s lead contractors for the first time.  The transition is on hold pending a GAO decision on the
protest, said Tricare’s Powell.  The contract will generate $1.4 billion in revenue for
UnitedHealth over five years, the company said on March 19. The
actual value to the insurer is far lower than the total award
after accounting for beneficiaries’ medical costs, UnitedHealth
said.  Federal Settlement  “No single thing” resulted in the agency’s decision to
give the contract to UnitedHealth, Austin Camacho, a Tricare
spokesman, said in a March 21 e-mail. He declined to elaborate.  The military health program considered factors including
price and past performance when weighing the proposals from both
companies, Camacho said.  The agency also looked at a $10 million false claims
settlement TriWest agreed to pay last year, he said.  That federal settlement came after four former employees
accused the company of failing to give the government discounts
negotiated with health providers.  The case involved about 3,000 of 50 million claims filed
during a five- or six-year period, said Scott Celley, a TriWest
spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
