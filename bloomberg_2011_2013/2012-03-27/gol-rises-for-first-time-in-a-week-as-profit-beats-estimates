Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
 Brazil ’s second-largest airline by market value, rose for the
first time in a week after reporting fourth-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  climbed 2 percent to 13.07 reais at 12:27 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo , leaving the stock poised for its first daily
advance since March 19. The benchmark Bovespa index fell 0.1
percent.  Gol’s net income dropped 59 percent to 54.3 million reais
($30 million), according to a regulatory filing. That beat the
average estimate for a net loss of 45 million reais among 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “While Gol’s results were weak, management pointed to
additional cost cutting initiatives and plans to boost cargo and
other ancillary revenues, such as the sale of snacks in certain
flights and increased focus on Smiles, Gol’s frequent flyer
program,” analysts at Barclays Plc including Daniel Spilberg
wrote in a note today.  Gol’s consolidated net sales increased 19.5 percent in the
fourth quarter to 2.2 billion reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
