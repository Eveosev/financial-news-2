(Corrects name of city manager in story originally
published March 28)  Democratic lawmakers paid respects
to a slain black Florida teenager as a senior member of the
Congressional Black Caucus offered his “heartfelt condolences”
to his parents for “the shock, the tragedy” of their loss.  In a packed Capitol Hill hearing room yesterday,
Representative  John Conyers  acknowledged Trayvon Martin’s
parents in the front row of a session called to bring attention
to a U.S. Justice Department probe of the 17-year-old’s Feb. 26
shooting death in Sanford, Florida. Conyers, a Michigan
Democrat, asked Martin’s parents to stand while attendees bowed
their heads in a moment of silence to honor their son.  “He’s sadly missed, and we’ll continue to fight for
justice for him,” Trayvon’s father, Tracy Martin, told the
group of Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus
Democrats who organized the informal hearing.  George Zimmerman, a Neighborhood Watch volunteer in
Sanford, a city of about 54,000 about 20 miles (32 kilometers)
north of Orlando, told police he shot the unarmed teenager in
self-defense after being punched in the nose and having his head
slammed into the sidewalk, said City Manager Norton Bonaparte Jr.  Still, lawmakers yesterday called for Zimmerman’s arrest
and for legislation to combat racial profiling.  Florida  Democrat Frederica Wilson said her home state’s
investigation into Martin’s death  “is laced with racial
profiling, lies and murder,” and that she was drafting
legislation to establish a commission on the social status of
black men and boys so that other black youths would not be
“hunted down like a rabid dog” and “shot in the street.”  Heart-Breaking Loss  “Trayvon was our son, but Trayvon is your son,” Martin’s
mother, Sybrina Fulton, clad in a black dress, told the
lawmakers. “A lot of people can relate to our situation and it
breaks their heart, just like it breaks mine.”  “Of course my heart is broken, but it breaks even more to
know that we do not have justice yet,” Fulton told reporters,
tears in her eyes, after the hearing.  The unofficial hearing included calls to repeal Florida’s
“stand your ground” law, which local officials said prevented
them from arresting Zimmerman because it is designed to protect
those who “reasonably” believe they are in danger. Zimmerman,
28, hasn’t spoken publicly and is in hiding because of death
threats.  “We really need to have some kind of feeling that we are
moving in the right direction,” said Representative Corrine Brown, a Florida Democrat whose district includes Sanford. “It
is very important that we have independent eyes on the
situation.”  Testifying at Hearing  Rebecca Monroe, acting director of the Justice Department’s
Community Relations Service; NAACP President and Chief Executive
Officer Ben Jealous; Dennis Parker, director of the  American
Civil Liberties Union ’s racial justice project; and Daniel
Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence,
were among the witnesses.  “We all know this was a botched investigation,” Wilson
told reporters following the hearing, adding, “I refuse to
allow the press and the police in Sanford to castigate” Martin.
The teenager was walking to the house of his father’s fiancee
house after buying Skittles and an Arizona iced tea at a
convenience store on the night of the shooting.  Zimmerman was driving to a grocery store when he saw Martin
walking through the gated community, according to an account
corroborated by Bonaparte. He started following the teenager on
foot and called police to report a suspicious person, according
to a recording authorities released. Zimmerman described Martin
as black, acting strangely and perhaps on drugs.  Police Report  Zimmerman told police he fell and that Martin got on top of
him and began slamming his head into the sidewalk. A police
report notes that Zimmerman was bleeding from the nose and back
of the head. Zimmerman said he began yelling for help, “but no
one would help me,” according to the incident report.  Martin’s family has said it was in fact the teenager
shouting, his voice captured on a 911 recording. Their attorneys
have an affidavit from his girlfriend saying that the time of
the shooting, she was on the phone with Martin, who was worried
that he was being followed. She said a man asked Martin what he
was doing in the neighborhood before she heard a tussle and lost
the connection.  The case has prompted rallies across the nation, including
outside the  Justice Department ’s headquarters in Washington
yesterday. About 150 people there held signs that read “Justice
for Trayvon” and chanted “Justice Now” during a demonstration
organized by the Mt. Ennon Baptist Church in Clinton, Maryland.  “We would like to see Attorney General Eric Holder move
expeditiously towards trying George Zimmerman under federal
hate-crimes legislation,” said Delman Coates, the church’s
pastor.  Curbing Profiling  In the Senate,  Ben Cardin  is intensifying his push for
legislation to curb racial profiling.  The Maryland Democrat came to the Senate floor yesterday to
press for legislation he introduced in October to bar state and
local  law enforcement  officials from receiving federal grants
unless they maintain policies to ensure race isn’t a factor in
criminal investigations.  “Racial profiling is bad policy, but, given the state of
our budgets, it also diverts scarce resources from law
enforcement,” Cardin said.  Cardin said he will escalate his push for the bill, S.
1670, before April 18, when civil rights groups plan to come to
 Washington  to lobby for legislation ending racial profiling.  While Cardin said it was unclear whether race was a factor
in Martin’s death or the local police’s response to it, he said
the fatal encounter “leads to a discussion of the broader issue
of racial profiling.” A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader
 Harry Reid  didn’t respond to a request for comment about whether
the Senate might consider Cardin’s legislation.  ‘Hearts Go Out’  House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican, said it is
“appropriate” that state and federal officials investigate the
shooting. “Our hearts go out to his family over this tragedy,”
Boehner told reporters yesterday.  House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of  Maryland  told
reporters it is “absolutely essential that we get to the bottom
of this so that we can see that justice is done.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
