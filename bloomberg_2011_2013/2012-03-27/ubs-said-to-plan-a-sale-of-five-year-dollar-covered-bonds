UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland â€™s biggest bank,
sold $2 billion of five-year covered bonds denominated in U.S.
dollars, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 2.25 percent notes were issued to yield 128 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the data show.
Zurich-based UBS hired Citigroup Inc., Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG to help
manage the sale.  UBS sold covered bonds in January, when it raised $1.5
billion from a 1.875 percent 2015 note, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Covered bonds are backed by mortgages or
public-sector loans and guaranteed by the issuer.  Mark Panday, a spokesman at the bank, declined to comment
on the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
