Malaysia’s ringgit climbed for a
third day, the longest winning streak since February, after the
 Federal Reserve  said monetary stimulus is still needed to
sustain a recovery in the world’s largest economy. Bonds gained.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of stocks rose the most in more
than three months after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
yesterday that while he is encouraged by a decline in the U.S.
unemployment rate, continued accommodative measures will be
needed to make progress.  The ringgit advanced 0.6 percent to 3.0570 per dollar as of
4:09 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has strengthened 3.8 percent this quarter, the
second-best performance among Asia’s 11 most-used currencies.  “Bernanke’s statement encourages investors to search for
higher-yielding assets,” said Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at
RAM Holdings Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “We expect the ringgit to
strengthen to 2.900 to the dollar by the end of 2012, although
the path may be choppy.”  The ringgit’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, slumped 22 basis
points to 7.38 percent.  Malaysia’s gross domestic product will rise at a slower
pace this year as financial and economic restructuring in
developed nations curb global growth, the central bank said last
week. The economy will expand 4 percent to 5 percent in 2012, it
said. That is less than the  Finance Ministry ’s 5 percent-to-6
percent forecast in October, and a 5.1 percent pace in 2011.  Five-year  government bonds  advanced. The yield on the 4.262
percent notes due September 2016 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.30 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
