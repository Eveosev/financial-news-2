Egypt  will offer a record 23
billion pounds ($3.8 billion) of repurchase agreements today as
the government sold more debt than targeted in March amid
declining yields. Dollar bonds fell for a second day.  The seven-day repos allow holders of government debt to
sell them back to the central bank to access funds for a week at
9.75 percent, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The
regulator accepted all 19 billion pounds of repos last week
after receiving bids for 22.6 billion pounds, the data show.  Local banks have stepped in to buy government debt as
foreign investors departed amid the unrest that followed the
ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  more than a year ago. Public
banks increased holdings of treasury bills by 34 percent to
100.7 billion pounds last year, according to the most recent
central bank data. Foreign investors sold 51.5 billion pounds of
the notes.  The  finance ministry  has exceeded its 51.5 billion-pound
debt sale goal in March by almost 8 percent, after falling 23
percent short of the 118.5 billion pounds it targeted in the
first two months of the year, according to ministry  data . Yields
soared by more than 2 percentage points on nine-month and one-
year securities since October. The central bank on March 20
reduced by two percentage points the local-currency reserve
requirement for banks to help “ease credit conditions in the
market.” The ratio now stands at 12 percent.  The yield on the country’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 advanced three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
6.42 percent at 10:36 a.m. in Cairo, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate has dropped 158 basis point in
the first quarter. The Egyptian pound was little changed at
6.0375 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
