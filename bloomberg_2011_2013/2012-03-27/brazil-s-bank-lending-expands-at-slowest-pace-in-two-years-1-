Brazil ’s bank lending expanded last
month at the slowest pace in two years, providing support to the
central bank’s strategy of cutting borrowing costs to close to
near-record lows to revive growth.  Outstanding credit  rose 17.3 percent in February from a
year ago to 2.03 trillion reais ($1.1 trillion), the central
bank said in a report distributed today in Brasilia. From a
month ago credit rose 0.4 percent after declining a revised 0.1
percent in January.  Policy makers signaled this month they plan to reduce the
benchmark interest rate to 9 percent this year, a quarter of a
point above its record low, after economic growth in the world’s
sixth biggest economy slowed to 2.7 percent last year from 7.5
percent in 2010.  Today’s report “is in line with the outlook the central
bank expects,”  Luciano Rostagno , chief strategist at Banco
WestLB do Brasil SA, said in a phone interview from  Sao Paulo .  The yield on interest rate future contracts maturing in
July 2012, the most traded in Sao Paulo, fell two basis points
to 9.01 percent at 10:54 a.m. local time. The real strengthened
0.3 percent to 1.8110 per  U.S. dollar .  Since August, President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration
reduced the overnight rate five times, cut taxes on  consumer
goods  and lifted measures to constrict credit in a bid to
accelerate economic growth to at least 4.5 percent this year.  Inflation Concerns  With unemployment near a record low and wages rising,
analysts are skeptical central bank president Alexandre Tombini
will succeed in bringing inflation back to the 4.5 percent
target this year and next, according to a central bank survey.  Consumer prices will rise 5.28 percent in 2012 and 5.5
percent in 2013, according to the median estimate of the survey
published March 26.  Economic growth will accelerate in the second half of the
year, and inflation is slowing toward the target, Tombini wrote
yesterday in a presentation posted on the bank’s website.  The average  interest rate  charged on consumer loans rose to
45.4 percent from 45.1 percent in January, the central bank
said. The average rate on company loans fell to 28.6 percent
from 28.7 percent.  The  consumer default  rate was unchanged from January at 7.6
percent, the highest since December 2009, while for company
loans it stayed at 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
