The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.2 percent to 697.05 at 4:25 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials increased
0.1 percent to 1,607.126.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the lowest close in almost a week in  New
York  after stockpiles surged in the U.S., the world’s largest
crude consumer, and Western countries discussed tapping
emergency reserves.  Crude for May delivery was at $105.32 a barrel, down 9
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:09 p.m. Singapore time. It dropped yesterday to $105.41,
the lowest settlement since March 22. Prices are 6.6 percent
higher this year and set for a second quarterly gain.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rose 9 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $15.51 a barrel at 10:17 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The
spread is at the widest since March 22.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold  dropped for a third day after jewelers in  India , the
world’s biggest buyer, extended a strike, curbing demand for the
metal. Platinum was poised for the first gain in five quarters.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.4 percent to $1,656.68 an ounce
and traded at $1,662.85 by 2:55 p.m. in Singapore. The metal
lost 1 percent yesterday, the biggest drop since March 14.
Bullion for June delivery rose as much as 0.4 percent to
$1,666.90 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  Platinum , the best-performing precious metal this year,
gained 0.3 percent to $1,640.65 an ounce. The metal used in auto
catalysts has rallied 17 percent this quarter on supply
disruptions in  South Africa  and prospects for increased demand.  BASE METALS  Copper may climb, heading for the biggest quarterly gain
since the end of 2010, on speculation yesterday’s slump by the
most in three weeks may stoke demand in  China , the world’s
biggest consumer.  Three-month copper was little changed at $8,352 a metric
ton on the London Metal Exchange by 4:04 p.m. Tokyo time. The
metal has risen 9.9 percent this quarter, the most since the
three months ended Dec. 31, 2010.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cotton for May delivery jumped 1.6 percent to settle at
94.03 cents a pound at 2:34 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching 94.08 cents, the highest for a most-active
contract since March 6. The commodity posted the sixth straight
gain, the longest rally since early January. The price is poised
for the first quarterly gain in a year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
