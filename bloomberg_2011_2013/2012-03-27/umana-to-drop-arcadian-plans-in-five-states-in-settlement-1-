Humana Inc. (HUM)  won approval from the
U.S. Justice Department to buy Arcadian Management Services Inc.
on the condition that it sell the acquired company’s Medicare
Advantage business in parts of five states.  The settlement with Humana, filed today in federal court in
 Washington , requires the Louisville, Kentucky-based health
insurer to divest the business in 51 counties to buyers that win
approval from antitrust officials, the department said in a
statement. The agreement still requires approval of a federal
judge.  “These divestitures preserve competition so that Medicare
beneficiaries, primarily senior citizens, in Arizona, Arkansas,
 Louisiana , Oklahoma and  Texas , benefit from lower prices, better
quality services and more innovative products for their health
care needs,” Sharis Pozen, the acting chief of the antitrust
division, said in the statement.  The department said the transaction as originally proposed
would have eliminated competition between Humana and closely
held Arcadian, which were “two of the few significant sellers
of Medicare Advantage plans” in counties where the business
will be sold.  The lines of business to be divested cover about 12,700
individual Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, according to a
competitive impact statement filed by the  Justice Department .  Humana announced it agreed to buy Oakland, California-based
Arcadian in August without disclosing financial terms. The
transaction was valued at $150 million by the two companies,
according to court papers filed by the department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
