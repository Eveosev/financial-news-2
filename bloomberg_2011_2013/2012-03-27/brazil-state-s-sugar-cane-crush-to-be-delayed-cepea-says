(Corrects timeframe in second paragraph.)  Sugar-cane crushing in  Brazil ’s Sao
Paulo state will start later this season due to limited
availability of the raw material, according to Cepea.  Harvesting probably will begin in the second half of April,
the University of Sao Paulo research group said in a report e-
mailed yesterday, citing its own survey. Farmers usually start
gathering the crop at the end of March or beginning of April,
according to Cepea analyst Heloisa Lee Burnquist. Brazil is the
world’s largest sugar producer and Sao Paulo state is located in
the Center-South region, the country’s main growing area.  Sugar-cane output in the Center South fell for the first
time in a decade in the 2011-12 season after dry weather, frost,
flowering and advanced age of the cane fields cut yields,
according to industry group Unica.  “Since 2010, weather conditions have been affecting the
quality of the sugar cane, which can also jeopardize the sugar
yield this year,” Burnquist wrote.  Exports of sugar from Brazil extended their profitability
over domestic sales last week, Cepea data show. Shipments were
more than 11 percent more profitable than sales in the domestic
market in the week ended March 23, up from 8.4 percent the
previous seven days, according to the report.  Domestic sales were 34 percent more profitable last week
than anhydrous ethanol, the type blended into gasoline, and 35
percent more advantageous than sales of the hydrous kind, used
in flex-fuel cars, Cepea said. Both ethanol and sugar are made
from sugar cane in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
