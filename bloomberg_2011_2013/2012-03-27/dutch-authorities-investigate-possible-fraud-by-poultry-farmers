Dutch authorities are investigating
possible fraud by poultry farmers who may have under-reported
the size of chicken flocks, the Netherlands’ Food and Consumer
Product Safety Authority reported.  Two locations in the southern Netherlands were searched
today and company accounts were seized for further examination,
the authority wrote in an online  statement  today. Records may
have been tampered with to make it appear fewer chickens were
supplied to poultry farmers, it said.  Dutch manure regulation mandates a maximum number of
animals per farm, and poultry farmers who want to expand their
flocks must buy additional animal-production rights, according
to the authority. Keeping more animals than the authorized
amount results in a “considerable” cost saving, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
