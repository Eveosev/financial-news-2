Azure Power India Pvt., a developer
of solar plants, won a grant from the U.S. Trade and Development
Agency for a project aimed at helping to bring sun-based power
to rural villages.  The $476,670 grant will fund microgrids powered by two 500-
kilowatt photovoltaic plants in the states of Gujarat and
Chhattisgarh, according to an e-mailed statement from Azure.  A microgrid helps deliver electricity locally to
communities that donâ€™t have access to grid power by setting up
standalone generators, storage and distribution infrastructure
nearby.  Azure plans to set up 100 microgrid solar systems to power
as many as 1,000 villages, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
