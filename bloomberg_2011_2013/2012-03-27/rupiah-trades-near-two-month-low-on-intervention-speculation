Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced the
most in almost a week as stocks rallied after the  Federal
Reserve  signaled it will keep U.S. borrowing costs near zero,
boosting demand for higher-yielding assets. Bonds fell.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  of shares gained 1.2 percent
after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday monetary
policy will remain accommodative to focus on creating jobs. At
least 3,000 protesters, less than the 8,000 the police had been
expecting, took to the streets in Jakarta today to demonstrate
against a plan to raise the price of subsidized fuel by 33
percent.  “The stock market is rising, boosting the rupiah,” said
Mika Martumpal, an analyst at PT CIMB Bank Niaga in Jakarta.
“From the domestic side, I think the people’s rejection of the
fuel-price hikes was not as bad as feared.”  The rupiah advanced 0.4 percent to 9,158 per dollar as of
4:19 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has declined 1 percent this
quarter. One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 8.25 percent.  The government is proposing raising the price of diesel and
low-octane gasoline to 6,000 rupiah ($0.65) per liter. The
legislature will vote on the government’s proposed revisions to
the 2012 budget, which include the fuel-price rises, on March 29.
Inflation could reach 6.8 percent in 2012 if the increases are
implemented, central bank Governor Darmin Nasution said March 8.
Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent last month from a year earlier.  The yield on the 7 percent bond due May 2022 increased four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.95 percent,
according to final prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
