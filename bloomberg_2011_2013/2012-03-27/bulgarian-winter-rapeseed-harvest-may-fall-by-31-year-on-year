The Bulgarian winter rapeseed
harvest may decline by as much as 31 percent this year from 2011
because of a dry autumn and winter frost, researcher
 UkrAgroConsult  said.  Bulgaria may reap between 360,000 metric tons to 400,000
tons of winter rapeseed this year, compared with 520,000 tons in
2011, the Kiev, Ukraine-based researcher said today in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
