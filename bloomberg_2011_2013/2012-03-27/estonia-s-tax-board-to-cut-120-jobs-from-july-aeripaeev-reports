Estonia’s Tax and Customs Board
plans to eliminate 120 jobs starting in July as it closes
regional offices,  Aeripaeev  reported, citing a draft bill.  The job cuts would reduce payroll costs by 585,000 euros
($781,500) in the second half of the year, with those funds to
be added to the salaries of high-level officials, said the
newspaper, which is based in the capital, Tallinn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
