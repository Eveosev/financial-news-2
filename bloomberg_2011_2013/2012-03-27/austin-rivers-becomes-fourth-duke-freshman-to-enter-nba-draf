Duke University guard Austin Rivers
will enter this year’s  National Basketball Association  draft
after becoming the third player in school history to lead the
team in scoring as a freshman.  Rivers, 19, the son of Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers, is
the fourth Duke player to leave for the NBA after playing one
season of college basketball, following Corey Maggette (1999),
 Luol Deng  (2004) and Kyrie Irving (2011). All three were among
the top 13 players selected in their respective drafts, with
Irving taken No. 1 overall last year.  “Austin had a terrific year as a freshman and has put
himself in a position to pursue his dream,” Duke coach  Mike Krzyzewski  said yesterday in a statement. “He is an outstanding
young man with an even more impressive family. We look forward
to watching him continue to develop and excel at the next
level.”  Rivers, who plans to hire an agent, averaged 15.5 points
for the Blue Devils this season to join Johnny Dawkins (1983)
and Bill Sapp (1945) as the only freshmen to lead Duke in
scoring. The Atlantic Coast Conference freshman of the year,
Rivers also averaged 3.4 rebounds and 2.1 assists.  “Coach K and the rest of the staff really helped me
develop and improve in all areas of the game,” Rivers said.
“It was a difficult decision to leave Duke, but I am excited
about chasing my dream of playing in the NBA.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
