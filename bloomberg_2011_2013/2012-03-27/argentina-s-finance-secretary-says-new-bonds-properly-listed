Argentine Finance Secretary Adrian Cosentino said the country’s dollar-denominated bonds due in
2018 and issued in November were properly listed in the
country’s securities exchanges last year.  Cosentino made the comments to reporters in  Buenos Aires 
today, responding to a Bloomberg News report that the national
pensions agency was the likely buyer of the bonds and that the
sale wasn’t announced in  Argentina ’s official gazette or on the
 Economy Ministry ’s website.  On the sale of $2.3 billion of seven-year dollar bonds:  “These bonds were correctly listed in 2011 and they were
issued in the context of the inter-state debt issuance
program.”  The sale, “validates the financial policy of optimal use
of internal resources and allowing Argentina to show indicators
on the evolution and sustainability of debt that are growing
stronger.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
