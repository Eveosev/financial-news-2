England collapsed to 193 all out in
the first cricket Test against  Sri Lanka  as Rangana Herath took
6 wickets for the hosts.  Four of the first seven England batsmen failed to reach
double figures, with Monty Panesar and  James Anderson  combining
for 36 runs for the final wicket. Ian Bell led the visitors with
52 runs as opening batsman  Alastair Cook  was trapped leg before
wicket without scoring a run, and Kevin Pietersen was bowled by
Chanaka Welegedara on 3.  Sri Lanka added 29 runs to its overnight total of 289-8 to
reach 318 all out today. Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene
made 180 before Anderson had him caught behind by wicketkeeper
Matt Prior to end the home team’s innings. Anderson finished as
 England ’s best bowler with 5-72.  The teams are scheduled to play two Tests. England is
seeking to rebound from a 3-0 sweep of losses against Pakistan
in the United Arab Emirates in January and February, while Sri
Lanka is without a Test series win since August 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
