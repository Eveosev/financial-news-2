Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s second-
largest cement maker, fell the most in three weeks in Zurich
trading after it sold a 1.5 percent stake for 296 million Swiss
francs ($327 million) to improve its finances.  The shares were priced at 59.25 francs a share in the
private placement, the Zurich-based company said in a  statement 
today. Holcim  stock  fell as much as 3 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since March 6, and traded 2.7 percent lower at
59.50 francs at 10:22 a.m.  “This is management tapping Holcim’s full valuation to de-
gear,” Ian Osburn, an analyst at ING Wholesale Banking, wrote
in an e-mailed note, adding it’s a “bearish signal” for the
stock. He has a “sell” recommendation on Holcim.  Holcim’s net debt widened 1.6 percent to 11.5 billion
francs in 2011. The company’s long-term  debt is rated  at the
second-lowest investment grade at Moody’s Investors Service and
 Standard & Poor’s . Holcim stock reached an eight-month high of
63.50 francs on March 14.  “We welcome any measures which strengthen Holcim’s balance
sheet,” wrote Christian Arnold, an analyst at Bank Vontobel
with a “hold” recommendation on the stock. “However, in the
short term it will somewhat put a cap on Holcim’s share price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
