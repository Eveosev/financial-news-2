EnQuest Plc (ENQ) , a North Sea oil
company, said it raised $900 million from a multi-currency
credit line to fund potential acquisitions and refinance an
existing credit facility.  The financing includes $525 million of committed funds and
$375 million potentially available if the London-based company
expands, according to a statement today.  The revolving credit facility provided by seven lenders
replaces a $280 million facility that expired earlier this year,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
