Asian  stocks  rose by the most this
year after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
accommodative monetary policy is still needed and a report
showed German business confidence unexpectedly gained, improving
the earnings outlook for Asian exporters.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a Japanese carmaker that gets 83 percent
of its sales abroad, added 3.5 percent as the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average erased losses since last year’s earthquake.  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest lender by
market value, added 2.5 percent after German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel  signaled she stands ready to do more to tame Europe’s
debt crisis.  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest liquefied
natural gas importer, jumped 11 percent in Seoul after its
Italian partner found reserves in Mozambique.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.9 percent, the most
since Dec. 21, to 128.13 as of 8:38 p.m. in Tokyo, paring its
monthly loss to 0.7 percent. The measure added 12 percent this
year through yesterday, headed for the biggest rally since the
third quarter in 2010.  Fed policy makers “still have an option of doing more, but
I think it was just reinforcing the view that they are not going
to reverse policy quickly,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-
based head of investment markets research at Colonial First
State Global Asset Management, which oversees about $150
billion. “There’s going to be a lot of liquidity provided for
the market and economy. Obviously equity investors are taking it
in a positive way.”  Quake Losses Erased  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 gained 2.4 percent with a late surge
causing it to finish above the closing level on March 11, 2011,
when a record earthquake and tsunami hit the nation. Trading
volume of stocks in the benchmark equity measure was 3.4 percent
below the average for the time of day over the past 30 trading
sessions.  The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index gained 1.6
percent, the most since Jan. 17.  South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 1 percent as the nation’s
central bank said  consumer confidence  climbed this month to the
highest level in four months.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 0.2 percent after the government
reported Chinese industrial companies had their first January-
February profit decline since 2009. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
added 0.9 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1.9
percent.  Volatility across the region fell. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI) 
dropped 8.9 percent to 18.87, the lowest since Aug. 1,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 5.4 percent in the
benchmark over the next 30 days. Gauges of anticipated price
movements for Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Korea’s  Kospi 200 Index (VKOSPI) 
also retreated.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index added 1.4 percent in New York yesterday
to close at the highest level since May 2008 after Bernanke said
that while he is encouraged by a drop in the  unemployment rate ,
the Fed needs to continue accommodative monetary policy to make
further progress.  Exporters Gain  Asian exporters gained. Honda advanced 3.5 percent to 3,270
yen.  Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , a surfwear maker that gets
about 50 percent of revenue from the Americas, rose 5.2 percent
to A$2.84.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , South Korea’s biggest
exporter of consumer electronics, rose 2.8 percent to 1.311
million won.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 10 percent this year
through yesterday on optimism the U.S. economy is recovering and
monetary policy easing from China to Japan and  Europe  will
bolster growth. That’s boosted the value of stocks listed in the
index to  15 times  estimated earnings on average, compared with
13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx Europe
600.  Stocks also rose after the Munich-based Ifo institute said
its German business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000
executives, increased to 109.8 from a revised 109.7 in February.
Economists forecast it would remain unchanged at the initial
February reading of 109.6, according to the median of estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  ‘German Commitment’  Financial firms gave the biggest boost to the Asia-Pacific
index’s advance after German Chancellor Merkel gave her first
indication that she is prepared to allow an increase in the
debt-crisis firewall, saying that Germany could let the
temporary and permanent rescue funds run in parallel.  “German chancellor is reinforcing the German commitment to
keeping the euro area together and providing finances as they
are required,” Colonial’s Halmarick said. “There are some
signs other countries may be struggling under the fiscal
requirements.”  Sumitomo Mitsui climbed 2.5 percent to 2,878 yen.  Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Australia’s third-largest
lender, rose 1.6 percent to A$23.18.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s
biggest lender, gained 2.3 percent to HK$70.40 in Hong Kong.  Korea Gas jumped 11 percent to 42,950 won after its partner
Eni SpA, Italy’s largest oil company, said yesterday it found
reserves in Mozambique that increase the resource base there by
10 trillion cubic feet.  Among stocks that  fell , Far East Horizon Ltd. slumped 9.8
percent to HK$6.35 as it plans to sell 450 million new shares.  Stockland (SGP) , Australia’s third-biggest property trust by
market value, slid 4.5 percent to A$3 after cutting its full-
year earnings forecast.  Of 641 companies listed in the Asia-Pacific measure that
have reported earnings since Jan. 9, more than half have missed
analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
