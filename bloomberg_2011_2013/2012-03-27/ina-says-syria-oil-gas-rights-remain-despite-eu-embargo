INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , a
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , said its
contract with the Syrian state oil company remains valid after
INA pulled out of  Syria  on Feb. 27 to comply with European Union
policy.  “The contracts INA signed with Syria remain legally
binding in that country and the contracts clearly define how and
under what procedure they can be broken,” INA said today in an
e-mailed response to questions. Recent media reports in  Croatia 
suggesting that Syria will award those contracts to another
company are “unfounded,” it said.  The refiner pulled out of Syria following the Croatian
government’s Feb. 23 decree to abide by an EU embargo on the
Middle Eastern country. The company said on Feb. 27 it has
informed the General Petroleum Co. of Syria it is
“temporarily” suspending all business activities in their
joint venture natural gas and crude oil facilities until further
notice, citing “force majeure.”  “INA continues to actively protect its interests in
Syria,” the Zagreb-based company said today, adding it
coordinates its business and legal activities in Syria with
other international  oil companies  present in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
