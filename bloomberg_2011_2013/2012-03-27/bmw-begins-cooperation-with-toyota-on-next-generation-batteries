Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  have begun joint research into next-generation
batteries to power cleaner vehicles.  The two automakers will try to increase the performance and
capacity of  lithium-ion batteries  with new combinations of
materials, Munich-based BMW said today in a  statement . In
addition to the research cooperation, BMW will supply Toyota’s
European unit with  diesel engines  starting in 2014.  The alliance allows Toyota,  Asia ’s largest carmaker, to
expand its European lineup of diesel-powered vehicles. For BMW,
the partnership allows the company to team up with the biggest
producer of hybrid vehicles, as it seeks to fend off  Volkswagen
AG (VOW3) ’s Audi, which aims to take the luxury-car lead.  The cooperation plans were originally announced Dec. 1. The
two companies signed an agreement formalizing that memorandum of
understanding, BMW said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
