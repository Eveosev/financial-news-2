The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments dropped six basis points to 267, according to BNP
Paribas SA at 7:35 a.m. in London. A decline signals improved
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 12.5
basis points to 577.5.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was down 2.5 at 114.5 basis points. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers declined five basis points to 200 and the
subordinated gauge was 6.5 lower at 316.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
