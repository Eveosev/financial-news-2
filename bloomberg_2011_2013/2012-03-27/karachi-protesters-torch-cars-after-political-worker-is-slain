Protesters torched cars and forced
shops and factories to close today in Karachi,  Pakistan ’s
financial capital, after gunmen killed a member of the city’s
biggest political party at his home.  Crowds of armed men pulled drivers from their cars and set
the vehicles alight, and blocked roads with burning tires, Geo
TV reported. The channel said two people died in the violence.  Today’s violence was the worst in Karachi since last
August, when more than 1,500 people died in clashes sparked by
turf wars between the city’s gangs. Transport companies
suspended services and gas stations stopped selling fuel, Geo TV
reported.  “The police and paramilitary forces are ensuring violence
remains limited, and does not spread to other parts of the
city,” Karachi police spokesman Sharfuddin Memon said. He could
not confirm that anyone died.  The violence broke out after gunmen killed Mansoor Mukhtar,
a worker with the  Muttahida Quami Movement , at his home
yesterday. His brother and sister-in-law were wounded, MQM
spokesman Raza Haroon said.  “Losses during violence such as this one in Karachi, are
normally as much as 12 billion rupees ($132.2 million),” said
Mian Abrar Ahmad, president Karachi Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, said on the phone. “There are 18,000 factories here,
and a million workers are directly affected by such closures.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
