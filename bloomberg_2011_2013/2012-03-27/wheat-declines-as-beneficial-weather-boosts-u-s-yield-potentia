Wheat futures in  Chicago  and  Kansas
City  fell the most in two months after a government report
showed warm, wet weather boosted crop conditions from Texas to
Illinois.  About 59 percent of the winter-wheat crop in Kansas, the
biggest U.S. grower, was in good or excellent condition as of
March 25, up from 31 percent a year earlier, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said yesterday. Texas wheat was 39 percent rated
in the top two categories, up from 11 percent last year, and
Oklahoma crops rated good or excellent rose to 75 percent from
21 percent a year ago. Illinois wheat was rated 78 percent good
or excellent.  “It looks like it will be one of the best U.S. crops in
the last 10 years,” Jeff Beal, a market analyst at the Gulke
Group Inc. in Rockford,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview.
“The weather has been very favorable for wheat development.”  Wheat futures for May delivery slumped 3 percent to close
at $6.3975 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest drop since Jan. 12.  The grain has fallen 12 percent
in the past year as rising world production will boost reserves
before the start of the Northern Hemisphere harvest season to
the highest since 2000.  On the Kansas City Board of Trade, wheat futures for July
delivery retreated 2.7 percent to settle at $6.885 a bushel, the
biggest drop since Jan. 18.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
