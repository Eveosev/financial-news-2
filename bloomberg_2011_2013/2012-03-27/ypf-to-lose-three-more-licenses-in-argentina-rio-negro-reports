Argentina’s  Rio Negro  province will
revoke three oil-field licenses from  YPF SA (YPFD) , the country’s
largest energy company, newspaper Rio Negro  reported  today,
citing a government official it didn’t identify.  The three areas are producing less than output targets set
by the provincial government, the newspaper said. YPF has five
fields in the southern province, according to the report. The
Buenos Aires-based company has had 13 oil-field concessions
revoked this month, including the three announced today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
