  Hong Kong ’s  exports  exceeded
analysts’ estimates in February as trade figures for the first
two months of the year were distorted by the timing of a Lunar
New Year holiday.  Overseas shipments rose 14 percent from a year earlier to
HK$259.8 billion ($33 billion), the government said on its
website today. That compared with an 8.6 percent decline in
January and the median estimate for a 4.9 percent gain in a
 Bloomberg News survey  of economists.  Export growth for January and February combined was weak
and marked a deceleration from the pace in the final quarter of
last year, the government said in a statement. Imports rose 20.8
percent in February, leaving a trade deficit of HK$45.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
