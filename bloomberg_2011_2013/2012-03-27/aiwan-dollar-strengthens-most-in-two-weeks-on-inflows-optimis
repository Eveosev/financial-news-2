Taiwan ’s dollar rose the most in
more than two weeks on optimism investors will favor emerging-
market assets after the Federal Reserve said accommodative
monetary policy is still needed to sustain U.S. economic growth.  Global funds bought $857 million more Taiwanese shares than
they sold this month, boosting net purchases for the quarter to
$4.8 billion, according to exchange data.  Stock indexes  across
Asia advanced today after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
yesterday in a speech that while he’s encouraged by the
unemployment rate’s decline, continued accommodative monetary
policy will be needed to make further progress.  “The greenback has gone weaker due to Bernanke’s
comments,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at  Union Bank
of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “There are also exporters selling the  U.S.
dollar .”  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.13 percent to NT$29.584 against
its U.S. counterpart, the biggest appreciation since March 8,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency has appreciated 2.4
percent this quarter.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings that traders use to price options, was little changed at
4.3 percent.  Government bonds  were steady. The yield on the 1.25 percent
notes due March 2022 was at 1.276 percent from 1.280 percent
yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market. The overnight
 money-market  rate was little changed at 0.403 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
