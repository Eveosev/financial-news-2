Angola plans to cut daily crude
exports by 5 percent in May from next month, according to a
final loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The west African nation would export 55 cargoes amounting
to 1.7 million barrels a day, compared with 56 cargoes totaling
1.79 million in April, the final schedules showed.  One shipment each of Girassol and Plutonio blend was
dropped from the preliminary schedule, while one consignment of
Hungo was increased to 1 million barrels from 950,000 barrels,
according to the plan.  Loading programs are monthly plans of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of the program are as follows. Cargo sizes are in
1,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
