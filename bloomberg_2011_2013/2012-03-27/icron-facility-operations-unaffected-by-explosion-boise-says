Micron Technology Inc. (MU)  facility
operations were unaffected after an explosion forced workers to
evacuate a company building in Boise,  Idaho , according to the
city’s fire department.  Micron’s emergency response team “evacuated approximately
200 people who work in the building,” the fire department said
in a statement on its website. “Two hours later, all but a
handful who work in the immediate area had returned to work.”  Boise firefighters and its hazardous-materials squad
responded to a report of an explosion at Micron at 9:59 a.m.
local time, according to the statement. Micron, the largest U.S.
maker of computer memory, is based in Boise.  Four people -- two Micron employees and two contractors --
were nearby when the explosion occured. One suffered a minor
cut, two are being evaluated for ringing in the ears, and one
inhaled dust, the fire department said. Three other workers are
being evaluated after breathing dust.  There was no chemical hazard as a result of the explosion,
according to the statement.  “Micron will continue to investigate the cause of the
explosion,” the fire department said.  Dan Francisco, a spokesman for Micron, referred inquiries
to the Boise Fire Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
