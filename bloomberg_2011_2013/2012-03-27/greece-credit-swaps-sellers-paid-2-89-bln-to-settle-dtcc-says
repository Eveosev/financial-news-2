Banks,  hedge funds  and other
investors that sold credit-default swaps protecting against
losses on Greece bonds paid a net $2.89 billion to settle the
contracts, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.  The payouts were completed yesterday after the nation took
steps to force investors this month to participate in the
biggest sovereign-debt restructuring in history, New York-based
DTCC, which runs a central repository for the market, said in an
e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
