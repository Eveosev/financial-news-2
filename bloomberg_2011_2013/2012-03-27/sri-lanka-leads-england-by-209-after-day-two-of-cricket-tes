Sri Lanka  built a lead of 209 after
bowling out visiting England for 193 runs today in their first
cricket Test in Galle.  Sri Lanka was 84-5 at the end of the second day as Graeme
Swann took 4 wickets to lead England’s attack. Seventeen wickets
fell today as batsmen on both sides struggled.  Mahela Jayawardene, who scored 180 runs in the first
innings, was caught off Swann for 5. Thilan Samaraweera led Sri
Lanka with 36 runs before getting stumped by Matt Prior off
Swann. Dinesh Chandimal, on 17, and Suraj Randiv, on 2, were
batting at the end of the day.  The hosts won the toss and elected to bat, reaching 318 all
out. Four of the first seven  England  batsmen failed to reach
double figures, with Monty Panesar and  James Anderson  combining
for 36 runs for the final wicket. Ian Bell led the visitors with
52 runs as opening batsman  Alastair Cook  was trapped leg before
wicket without scoring a run, and Kevin Pietersen was bowled by
Chanaka Welegedara on 3.  “The bowlers have been outstanding all winter, and we
batsmen haven’t backed them up,” Bell said in a televised
interview. “It’s been a tough day for us.”  Sri Lanka added 29 runs today to its overnight first
innings total of 289-8. Sri Lanka captain Jayawardene was 20
short of a double century when Anderson had him caught behind by
Prior to end the home team’s innings. Anderson finished as
England’s best bowler with 5-72.  The teams are scheduled to play two Tests. England is
seeking to rebound from a 3-0 sweep of losses against  Pakistan 
in the  United Arab Emirates  in January and February, while Sri
Lanka is without a Test series win since August 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
