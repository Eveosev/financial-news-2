A U.S. judge entered a
$9.4 billion judgment against Hezbollah after the Lebanon-based
group defaulted in a lawsuit over the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.  U.S. District Judge George Daniels in  Manhattan  today said
that Hezbollah, designated a terrorist group by the U.S. State
Department, must pay the damages to insurers including  Chubb
Corp. (CB)  that sought to recoup payments to business and property
policyholders for losses from the attacks.  The insurers won default judgments in 2006 against al-Qaeda
and Hezbollah after the groups didn’t contest the suit.  “Obviously we’re pleased that a judgment has been
entered,” said Sean Carter, a lawyer for Warren, New Jersey-
based Chubb, whose Federal Insurance Co. unit was allocated $4.5
billion, the largest share of the damages.  Carter, who said it’s unlikely the insurers will ever
collect the full amount of the judgment, said they can take
advantage of a U.S. law that permits parties to execute
judgments against terrorist assets frozen by the government.  “It’s not purely an academic or a symbolic exercise,” he
said.  The case is Federal Insurance Co. v. Al Qaida, 03-CV-6978,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
