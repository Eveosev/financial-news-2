The Federal Trade Commission said
that RockYou, the operator of a social game site, agreed to pay
$250,000 as part of a settlement for failing to protect the
privacy of its users.  Security flaws in the RockYou game site exposed the email
addresses and passwords of 32 million users, the FTC said today
in a statement. The settlement order requires the company to
also implement a comprehensive data security program, the agency
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
