Four Singapore-based equity
analysts from  Maybank Kim Eng Holdings Ltd. (KEH)  have resigned from
its research unit, the head of the company said.  The employees quit over the past two weeks, said Tengku Dato’ Zafrul Aziz, director of Maybank Kim Eng, in an e-mailed
response to questions today.  “We have already identified some of the replacements and
are hoping to have them on board soon,” said Zafrul Aziz,
without naming the departing or prospective employees. Including
the four workers that are leaving, Maybank Kim Eng employs 17
analysts and 800 employees and remisiers in Singapore, he said.  Maybank, as Malaysia’s largest lender  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY) 
is called, completed the acquisition of Singapore-based Kim Eng
in May last year for S$1.79 billion ($1.4 billion), giving it
brokerage and  investment banking  operations in Singapore,
Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The combined
investment banking and broking entity has 3,000 employees,
Zafrul Aziz said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
