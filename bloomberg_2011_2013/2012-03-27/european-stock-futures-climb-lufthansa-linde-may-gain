European  stock futures  advanced,
indicating that the Stoxx Europe 600 Index will gain for a third
day, before a report that may show the U.S. real-estate market
is stabilizing. U.S. index futures were little changed, while
Asian shares jumped.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Europe’s biggest airline by sales,
and  Linde AG (LIN)  may climb after JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its
recommendation on both companies.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, a benchmark for the
euro area, added 0.6 percent to 2,485 at 7:03 a.m. in London.
Futures on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index increased 0.4 percent.
Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June rose
0.1 percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.8
percent.  House prices  in 20 U.S. cities probably fell at a slower
pace in the year to January, economists said before a report
today. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20
cities dropped 3.8 percent from January 2011, the smallest
decline in three months, according to the median forecast of 32
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
