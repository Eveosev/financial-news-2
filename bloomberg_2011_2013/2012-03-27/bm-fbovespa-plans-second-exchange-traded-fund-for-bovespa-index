BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of
 Latin America ’s biggest securities exchange, started a bidding
process to select the manager of a second exchange-traded fund
that tracks  Brazil ’s benchmark equity index.  The exchange wants to “increase the diversity of products
offered to the market” with the new ETF tracking its main stock
gauge, BM&FBovespa said in a statement on its website.  There are 12 ETFs trading on the exchange. Only one,
BlackRock Inc.’s  iShares Ibovespa Fundo de Indice , tracks the
Bovespa index.  Trading in ETFs on the Sao Paulo exchange totaled 2.18
billion reais ($1.2 billion) in February, or 1.5 percent of all
stock trading volume, according to data from BM&FBovespa.
Trading on the iShares Ibovespa totaled 2 billion reais last
month.  BM&FBovespa will announce the winning bidder on May 7, the
exchange said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
