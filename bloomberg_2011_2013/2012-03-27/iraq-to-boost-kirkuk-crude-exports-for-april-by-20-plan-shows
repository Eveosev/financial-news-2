Iraq plans to increase its daily
exports of Kirkuk crude for April from the Turkish port of
Ceyhan by 20 percent from this month, according to a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  A total of 24 cargoes of the blend are expected to be
shipped next month, amounting to 15.3 million barrels or 510,000
barrels a day, the schedule showed. This compares with plans for
21 consignments totaling 425,484 barrels a day for March.  Kirkuk shipments from Ceyhan in the  Mediterranean Sea  were
halted nine times since the end of November because of technical
reasons, bad weather or explosions, the Iraqi Oil Ministry said
in a statement on Feb. 14.  As a result, exports from the port were less than that
scheduled. In January, 17 cargoes of the crude totaling 387,677
barrels a day were shipped compared with a planned 447,742
barrels, according to shipping reports obtained by Bloomberg.  Exports dropped to 369,447 barrels a day in February,
compared with 448,276 barrels in the original shipping schedule,
the reports showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
