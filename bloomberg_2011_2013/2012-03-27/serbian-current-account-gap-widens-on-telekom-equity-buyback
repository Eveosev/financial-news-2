Serbia’s current-account deficit
widened in January after the country’s state-controlled phone
company bought back a 20 percent stake sold by  Greece ’s  Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization SA. (HTO)   The shortfall totaled 268.6 million euros ($358.25 million)
expanding 20.8 percent on the year, the Belgrade-based Narodna
Banka Srbije said on its website today. A 10.8 percent trade
deficit increase also fueled the gap.  Foreign direct investment outflows stood at 430 million
euros in the month when  Telekom Srbija , the dominant fixed-line
and mobile service operator, bought back the stake from Greece’s
OTE for 380 million euros and paid an additional 17 million
euros in dividends to its former partner.  Net portfolio investments rose to 41.5 million euros from
35.2 million euros in the same month last year, with investment
in the government debt more than doubling to 48.5 million euros
from 19.9 million euros last year.  Foreign direct and portfolio investments are critical for
 Serbia  to help it finance the budget deficit through domestic
market borrowing and stabilize the weakening dinar ahead of May
6 parliamentary elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
