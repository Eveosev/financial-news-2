BTA Bank (BTA) , the biggest Kazakh lender
before defaulting on $12 billion of debt in 2009, lost 85.1
billion tenge ($576 million) in assets last month amid plans to
restructure debt for the second time in as many years.  Assets shrank to 1.476 trillion tenge in February from
1.561 trillion tenge in January, the Kazakh central bank’s
financial oversight committee said in a monthly report on its
 website  today. The liabilities of the lender exceeded assets by
385.2 billion tenge as of March 1, compared with a gap of 300
billion tenge a month earlier, the regulator said.  BTA is negotiating its second debt restructuring since 2010
after failing to make an interest payment on its July 2018
dollar bonds in January. The lender said March 1 that its
workforce will be reduced by 25 percent.  The following table shows the one-month performance of
 Kazakhstan ’s five largest lenders by assets, along with seventh-
ranked Alliance Bank and 13th-ranked Temirbank, and their
position as of March 1. The data from the oversight committee
are in billions of tenge:  To contact the reporter on this story:
