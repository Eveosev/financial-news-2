Peru  seeks to reduce illegal coca
production by 30 percent in the next five years as it steps up
eradication of the crop, the government said.  The government is targeting the eradication of 110,000
hectares (271,816 acres) of coca bushes by 2016, the Andean
nation’s drug control agency known as Devida said in an e-mailed
statement today. Seizures of chemicals used to convert coca
leaves into cocaine will rise to 3,500 metric tons from 1,500
metric tons this year, it said.  Rising production in Peru has seen the country match
 Colombia  as the world’s biggest supplier of the leaf. Each
country produces about 40 percent of the world’s coca, according
to a  United Nations report last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
