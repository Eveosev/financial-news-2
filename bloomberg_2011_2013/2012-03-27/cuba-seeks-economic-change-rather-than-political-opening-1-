Cuba won’t alter its political
system, even as it considers deepening changes to its state-
controlled economy, said Marino Murillo, vice president of the
 Council of Ministers ,  “In Cuba there will not be political reform,” Murillo
told a news conference in Havana today.  Murillo made his comments as Pope Benedict XVI visited the
island, calling for greater economic and political changes.
Speaking to in Santiago de Cuba today, Benedict said he was
praying for “those who suffer, who are deprived of liberty,
separated from their loved ones or who are going through serious
moments of difficulty.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
