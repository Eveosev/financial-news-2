Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-biggest U.S. life insurer, is planning a benchmark
offering of bonds it will guarantee that would also be backed by
residential-mortgage securities held by one of its units,
according to two people familiar with the offering.  The collateral will consist of home-loan debt with
principal balances that total 2.85 times the face value of the
notes being sold, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the terms aren’t set. The securities are set to receive
an A rating from  Standard & Poor’s , one of the people said. The
bonds would mature in 3.5 years and carry a projected average
life of 3 years. Benchmark offerings are typically at least $500
million.  Bob DeFillippo , a spokesman for  Newark , New Jersey-based
Prudential, declined to comment.  The offering is more similar to so-called covered bonds
than mortgage-backed securities or securitizations used to
repackage them, which typically don’t carry guarantees from the
issuers. Unlike most covered bonds, the Prudential notes would
involve a static pool of debt, rather than a revolving set of
collateral, one of the people said.  Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Plc and Wells Fargo & Co. are
managing the sale, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
