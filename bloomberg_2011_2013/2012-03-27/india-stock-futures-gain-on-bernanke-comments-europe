Indian stocks rebounded from a two-
month low, mirroring Asian equities, after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled further monetary stimulus and
as business confidence unexpectedly improved in Germany.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the country’s biggest
producer of copper and zinc, surged the most in two weeks.  DLF
Ltd. (DLFU) , the largest developer, rallied the most in four weeks.
 Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the biggest home-products maker,
climbed to its highest level this year.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 1.3 percent
to 17,280.06, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai after losing 1.8 percent yesterday. The gauge has
risen 12 percent this year, poised for its first quarterly
advance since December 2010, as foreign funds bought a net $9.1
billion of shares this year on optimism the central bank will
cut interest rates to shield growth from Europe’s debt crisis.
Emerging-market stock funds took in $782 million in the week
ended March 21 for a 12th straight week of flows, according to
EPFR Global.  “The first trigger is going to be global liquidity and as
long as that remains positive,  India  will see flows whenever the
market goes to an attractive level,” Toral Munshi, head of
India equity research at Credit Suisse Wealth Management, told
Bloomberg UTV today. “In addition to liquidity, the rate cycle
is going to the key trigger for Indian markets.”  Bernanke said monetary policy is still needed to foster a
recovery in the world’s biggest economy. A gauge of the German
business climate improved, while  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
indicated for the first time she’s prepared to allow an increase
in Europe’s debt firewall, easing concerns the crisis may
reignite in the region, India’s biggest trading partner.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 2.1 percent, the most
since Dec. 1, to 128.32. The gauge added 12 percent this year,
headed for the biggest rally since the third quarter in 2010.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
declines in the S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index Nifty, sank 6.3 percent to
25.05. The Nifty climbed 1.1 percent to 5,243.15 and its April
futures traded at 5,310. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  added 1.1 percent to
2,135.37. A total 1,004 million shares changed hands on the BSE
and NSE yesterday, 9 percent more than the daily average in the
past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Foreigners bought a net  3.3 billion rupees  of the nation’s
stocks on March 22 and March 23, raising investment this year to
450.2 billion rupees, according to the regulator. That’s an all-
time high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
