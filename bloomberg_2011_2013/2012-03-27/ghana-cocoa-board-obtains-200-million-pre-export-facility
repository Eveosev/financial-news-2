The  Ghana  Cocoa board, which
markets the commodity for the West African country, signed a
$200 million pre-export financing facility, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The three-year  credit line , which will be secured against
fixed price contracts with buyers of the crop, will be used to
upgrade warehouses and cocoa farms in Ghana, the lenders said in
a Dec. 2 statement when the facility was initially sought.  Cocobod, as the Accra-based board is known, is also in
talks with banks to refinance its annual pre-export finance
facility, according to three people with knowledge of the
matter, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
