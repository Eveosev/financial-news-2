German  consumer confidence  will
decline for the first time in seven months in April as rising
energy prices curb household spending power,  GfK SE (GFK)  said.  The Nuremberg-based market research company predicted today
that its consumer-sentiment index, based on a survey of about
2,000 people, will slip to 5.9 from a 12-month high of 6 in
March. Economists forecast an unchanged reading, according to
the median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  A 40 percent jump in  oil prices  over the past six months is
driving up energy costs and fueling inflation, threatening to
slow the economic recovery. At the same time, advances by
governments to solve the European debt crisis boosted German
investor and business confidence this month.  “Record prices for petrol and diesel at German petrol
pumps have clearly affected the mindset of consumers,” GfK said
in a statement. “Despite the light drop, the indicator level
still shows that  consumer spending  will remain one of the
pillars of the German economy this year.”  GfK’s index of income expectations fell to 34.3 in March
from 41.3 in February. A measure of consumers’ willingness to
spend slipped to 38.6 from 39.2, while a gauge of economic
optimism rose to 7.2 from 5.9.  Germany ’s economy contracted 0.2 percent in the final
quarter of 2011. While it “may still be moving sideways,”
confidence indicators suggest “a rejuvenation of the economy in
the early part of 2012” as unemployment at a two-decade low
boosts household spending, the Bundesbank said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
