Italy sold 3.82 billion euros ($5.1
billion) of zero-coupon and inflation-linked bonds as borrowing
costs fell to a four-month low.  The Treasury sold 2.82 billion euros of the zero-coupon
2014 debt to yield 2.352 percent, the lowest since November and
down from 3.013 percent at the previous auction on Feb. 24.
Investors bid for 1.86 times the amount offered, down from 1.93
times last month. The Rome-based Treasury also sold 1 billion
euros of inflation-linked bonds due in 2019 and 2021 to yield
3.06 percent and 3.45 percent respectively.  Italy’s borrowing costs have fallen as Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s efforts to spur economic growth and reduce the euro
region’s second-biggest debt, coupled with the European Central
Bank unlimited three-year lending, shore up demand for bonds.  “Italy has gained the most in the post-LTRO landscape”
and “the ‘Monti factor’ has become a key pillar of support for
Italian bonds,” Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro
Sovereign Strategy in  London , said by e-mail. “The key question
is what happens if sentiment towards  Spain  deteriorates
markedly. Italy is unlikely to be spared.”  Italian 10-year bonds fell after the auction, pushing the
yield up four basis points to 5.07 percent as of 12.57 p.m.
local time.  The drop in yields at the Italian bond sale contrasts with
rising borrowing costs at an auction in Spain. The Treasury had
to pay 0.836 percent to sell six-month bills, more than the
0.764 percent of a month ago, while the cost of its three-month
debt declined at a sale of 2.6 billion euros of both securities.  Monti’s government passed 20 billion euros of Italian
budget cuts and tax hikes in December to balance the budget in
2013, followed by measures to spur competition and reduce
bureaucracy. This month his government overhauled  labor laws  to
make it easier to fire workers while extending the country’s
unemployment safety net.  To contact the reporter on this story:
