The  surplus  of supertankers
competing to load 2 million-barrel shipments of Middle East
crude oil shrank to an eight-week low.  There are 7.5 percent more vessels for hire over the next
30 days than there are likely cargoes, according to the median
estimate of six shipbrokers and owners surveyed by Bloomberg
News today. Thatâ€™s the lowest level since Jan. 31 and compares
with a 12 percent excess a week ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
