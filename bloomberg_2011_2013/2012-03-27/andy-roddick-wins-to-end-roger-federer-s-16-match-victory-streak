Andy Roddick  upset Roger Federer in
the third round of the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, the
American’s third victory in 24 career meetings against the
former No. 1 tennis player in the world.  Roddick beat Federer  7-6 (7-4), 1-6, 6-4  for his first
official win against the Swiss player since the quarterfinals of
the 2008 tournament in Miami. Roddick also beat Federer in an
exhibition match at  New York ’s Madison Square Garden three weeks
ago.  A two-time champion in Miami, Roddick’s victory last night
ended Federer’s 16-match winning streak.  The third-ranked Federer had taken his 19th Masters tennis
title last week in Indian Wells, California, and before last
night had been 40-2 since the 2011  U.S. Open . He’d won his
previous 77 matches against players ranked outside the top 20.
Roddick, also a former world No. 1, is 34th in the ATP rankings.  Roddick advanced to face  Juan Monaco  of Argentina.  Top-seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia and eighth-seeded Mardy Fish of the U.S. also won third-round matches yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
