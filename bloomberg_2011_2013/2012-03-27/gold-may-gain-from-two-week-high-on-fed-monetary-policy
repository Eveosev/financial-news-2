Gold declined from a two-week high
as the dollar’s rebound eroded demand for the metal as an
alternative investment.  The greenback rose from a three-week low against a basket
of major currencies, as optimistic reports on  consumer
confidence  and housing weakened the case for additional stimulus
by the  Federal Reserve . Yesterday, gold jumped the most in four
weeks after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that accommodative
 monetary policy  was needed to bolster the labor market.  “The dollar’s strength is keeping gold quiet,” Dennis Cajigas, a senior market strategist at Zaner Group in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “We are seeing some profit-
taking.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell 50 cents to settle at
$1,687.70 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $1,699.60, the highest for a most-
active contract since March 13.  The precious metal has gained 7.7 percent this year.
Holdings in  exchange-traded products  backed by gold jumped 5
metric tons to 2,394.6 tons yesterday. The amount rose to a
record on March 13.  Silver futures for May delivery slid 0.4 percent to $32.616
an ounce. The metal has advanced 17 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery slumped 0.9 percent to $663 an ounce. Platinum
futures for July delivery advanced 0.7 percent to $1,662.10 an
ounce, the third straight gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
