Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell for
the first time in four days on concern fuel-price increases will
fan inflation, limiting the scope for interest-rate cuts. The
dong was little changed.  Vietnam raised the price of petroleum products, including
gasoline, by as much as 12 percent March 7. Slower  inflation  may
allow Vietnam to cut  interest rates  by 100 basis points in each
of the second, third and fourth quarters, central bank Governor
Nguyen Van Binh said March 12. Consumer prices rose 14.15
percent this month, the smallest gain in a year.  “People are a little bit concerned about inflation next
month,” said Nguyen Duc Hai, Ho Chi Minh City-based portfolio
manager at Manulife Asset Management. Banks’ reluctance to
reinvest income from maturing debt also contributed to the
decline in bonds, he said.  The  yield  on benchmark five-year notes rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 11.47 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,900 per dollar as of 4:20 p.m. in
Hanoi, little changed from yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate 
at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
