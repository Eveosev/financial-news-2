Technip SA (TEC) , the European oil-
services provider whose shares slumped following a gas leak in
the U.K.  North Sea , said it didn’t design the affected platform.  Technip designed one of three platforms at the Elgin and
Franklin fields operated by  Total SA (FP) , and not the one where gas
is leaking, said Floriane Lassalle-Massip, a spokeswoman.  The  shares  closed down 3.2 percent in Paris trading, the
biggest one-day decline in three weeks, amid news that Total was
battling to contain a leak at the offshore fields. Total lost 6
percent on concern the seepage could take months to contain.  Technip designed the production/utilities/quarters, or PUQ,
platform at Elgin, rather than the field’s wellhead platform
where gas is escaping, Lassalle-Massip said by telephone.  The Elgin facilities were evacuated after a blowout on
March 25 during an operation to abandon a well. Hydrocarbons
produced at the Elgin and Franklin fields, about 140 miles (225
kilometers) east of Aberdeen in  Scotland , are collected and
processed on the PUQ before being exported by pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
