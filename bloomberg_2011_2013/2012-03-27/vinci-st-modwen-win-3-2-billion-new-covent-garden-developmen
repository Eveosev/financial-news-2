Vinci SA (DG) ’s U.K. unit and St. Modwen
Properties Plc were chosen to develop the 2 billion-pound ($3.2
billion) New Covent Garden Market mixed-use neighborhood in
southwest  London .  VSM Estates, a joint venture of St. Modwen and Vinci Plc,
was selected to build a 500,000 square-foot (46,450 square-
meter) market on a 57-acre site near London’s Battersea Power
Station, the companies said in a statement today. The project by
the Covent Garden Market Authority will be occupied by about 200
businesses.  “Our focus on developing a solution that enables the
market to continue to trade efficiently throughout the
construction program has been critical,” Vinci Plc Chief
Executive John Stanton said in the statement.  The project will be funded by the development of 20 acres
of surplus land for 2,800 homes and other uses, St. Modwen said
in an e-mail. Construction will start next year once planning
permission is given and businesses will move in starting in
2014.  The land is part of a 195-hectare industrial area allocated
by local governments for redevelopment into 16,000 homes as well
as offices. Royal Mail Group Ltd. won approval on March 6 to
turn a mail-sorting office there into about 1,900 homes and a
new U.S. embassy will be built there.  Vinci SA, based in the Paris suburb of Rueil-Malmaison, is
 Europe ’s largest builder. St. Modwen of Birmingham,  England ,
specializes in neighborhood regeneration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
