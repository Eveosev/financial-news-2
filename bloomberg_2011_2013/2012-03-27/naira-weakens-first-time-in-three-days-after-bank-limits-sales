The naira weakened for the first
time in three days after the central bank reduced its supply of
dollars just as  oil companies  are increasing their demand.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
as much as 0.6 percent before paring its loss to less than 0.1
percent at 157.675 per dollar by 3:45 p.m. in Lagos, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria sold $128.75 million at a foreign-currency auction
yesterday, the lowest since Feb. 22, according to the Abuja-
based central bank. The central bank banned in October oil
companies that export crude from buying dollars at its auctions,
leaving them dependent on the interbank market and other
sources. A majority of crude exporters are also importers of
oil.  “Oil companies are unable to source dollars for second-
quarter imports at the official auction due to the ban, a
development that has increased demand at the  interbank market ,”
Sewa Wusu, currency analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital
Ltd., said by phone. “Higher dollar supply from the official
and autonomous sources is needed to outweigh demand for second-
quarter imports by oil importers,” Wusu said.  Nigeria approved a tender to import 3.57 million metric
tons of gasoline for the second quarter on March 12. Oil imports
are a major source of pressure on the naira, according to the
central bank.  The regulator left its key  interest rate  unchanged at 12
percent for a third consecutive meeting on March 20 to curb
inflation and stabilize the local currency.  Inflation (NGCPIYOY)  declined
to 11.9 percent in February from 12.6 percent a month earlier,
the National Bureau of Statistics said March 19.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s $500 million of dollar bonds due
2021 fell 2 basis points to 5.377 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.2 percent to 1.779 per dollar in
Accra, its lowest level since at least June 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
