Ethanol futures fell for a second
day in  Chicago  on record stockpiles and a drop in corn prices.  Futures dropped 1.2 percent.  Stockpiles (DOESFETH)  of ethanol rose to
a record 22.7 million barrels in the week ended March 16,
according to the Energy Department. A March 30 Agriculture
Department report may show that farmers will increase corn
planting this year because of favorable weather, lowering
ethanol production costs.  “There’s selling pressure in the front,” said  Ian
Jackson , a trader at SCB & Associates in Chicago. “There’s a
lot of product out there. People are also flattening out
positions ahead of Friday’s big report.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery slipped 2.7 cents to
$2.248 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price
since March 8. Prices have increased 2 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf fell 1.5
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.30 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive lost 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.25, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  dropped 0.5 cent to $2.355 a gallon and
on the West Coast the biofuel increased 2.5 cents, or 1 percent,
to $2.425.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 7 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $6.3075 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
