Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
erased losses since the country’s record earthquake as the
declining yen and $241 billion of reconstruction spending helped
make it the best-performing benchmark index in the developed
world this year.  The Nikkei 225 surged 21 percent in 2012 as central bank
intervention helped weaken the yen, boosting the outlook for
Japan’s exporters as the country rebuilds.  Taiheiyo Cement Corp. (5233) 
led the Nikkei’s gains, climbing 61 percent on efforts to repair
damage from the temblor and tsunami.  Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , a
discount clothier, jumped 51 percent as electricity shortages
forced people to buy more seasonal clothing.  Something Holdings
Co. (1408) , a provider of ground surveying and strengthening, increased
eightfold, the most of any Japanese listed stock.  The Nikkei 225 rose 2.4 percent to 10,255.15 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo yesterday. The gauge fell 1.7 percent to finish
at 10,254.43 on March 11, 2011, when the earthquake struck 14
minutes before the market closed. The measure fell 16 percent in
the next two trading days, the biggest decline since the October
1987 Black Monday crash.  “It is profound that the market has finally made back its
losses, but we have a long way to go toward true
reconstruction,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at
 Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co. (8403) , which manages the equivalent of
$302 billion. “It was shocking the yen surged that much after
the quake. The stronger yen had held back a stock recovery.”  The earnings outlook for exporters has improved after the
 Bank of Japan  in February expanded monetary stimulus to drive
down the yen and as economic reports from the U.S. signaled
recovery in the world’s largest economy. Companies are
benefiting from about 20 trillion yen ($241 billion) earmarked
for reconstruction spending since the March 11 disaster.  Yen Surge  A gauge of carmakers, which includes some of Japan’s
largest exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor
Co., had the  fourth-largest  advance on the broader Topix Index
this year, followed by a measure of shipping companies. Toyota,
which gets more than 70 percent of sales outside  Japan , has
contributed the most to the Nikkei’s advance this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yen surged in the days following the quake and the
ensuing tsunami and nuclear crisis amid speculation that
Japanese companies would need to repatriate funds to pay for
reconstruction. Action by the Group of Seven nations curbed
those gains until demand for a haven from the slowing recovery
in the U.S. and the European sovereign-debt crisis drove the
currency to a post-World War II high against the dollar in
October. It has since retreated about 9 percent.  ‘More Optimistic’  “What I see on the ground in Japan is very different from
last time I was there in December,” said Kenichi Amaki, a
portfolio manager at Matthews International Capital LLC, which
manages $17.8 billion. “In December, the yen was still
strengthening, a lot of companies were pessimistic about 2012.
This time around, I think they’re still cautious but they’ve
turned more optimistic,” he said in an interview in  Hong Kong 
on March 20.  The Nikkei 225 will rise to 10,500 by year-end, according
to the median of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s just
2.4 percent higher than the March 11, 2011, close. The Topix
will end the year at 875, below the 915.51 close on the day of
the quake, according to the median of 17 strategists’ estimates.  Before the quake struck, Japan’s equity market was among
the developed world’s worst performers. Where the MSCI World
Index rose 91 percent from its bottom on March 9, 2009, to the
day before the quake, the Nikkei 225 climbed 47 percent. That
rally pared losses since a December 1989 peak to 73 percent by
March 10, 2011.  Recovery ‘At Last’  About half of the companies listed in Japan recovered in
their share prices and market values since March 11, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies that rose the most
include  First Energy Service Co. (9514) , an energy-management services
provider, and  Hazama Corp. (1719) , a builder of dams and highways.  “The equity recovery has come at last,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee 1.88 trillion yen ($23 billion) as
chief strategist at  Toyota Asset Management Co. (CKAM)  in Tokyo. “The
global economy is holding up and will support the market here
after reconstruction demand peaks in the first half. The Nikkei
will rise to between 11,000 and 12,000 this year.”  The Nikkei 225 has risen 26 percent since  bottoming  at
8,160.01 on Nov. 25, as signs of a U.S. recovery and progress in
containing  Europe ’s debt crisis buoyed the global outlook. Among
developed-market benchmark equity gauges,  Germany ’s DAX Index is
the closest to the Nikkei 225, having also advanced about 21
percent since the start of the year.  Relative Valuation  Shares on the Japanese gauge trade at  1.35 times  net assets
compared with 2.3 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
1.46 times on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The Nikkei’s price-to-
book ratio was as low as 1.06 in November. A reading below one
means a company can be bought for less than the value of its
assets.  The average daily number of shares traded on the first
section of the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange rose to about 2.18 billion
this year, returning near the levels in the three months before
the quake. After the initial jump amid the unfolding nuclear
disaster at Fukushima, average daily volume fell to 1.83 billion
shares between March 18 and Dec. 30.  “General contractors and construction machinery-related
shares are an attractive investment, as there’s scope for demand
on reconstruction efforts,” said Mitsuyuki Kobayashi, chairman
of Metzler Asset Management, which manages about 2 billion euros
($2.7 billion). “But the clean-up of rubble isn’t moving
forward, and there’s a possibility there won’t be major recovery
investment in areas with high radiation. We can’t be too much at
ease.”  Economic Prospects  Japan’s economy contracted 0.7 percent in the three months
ended Dec. 31, less than the government’s preliminary estimate
of 2.3 percent, improving prospects for the recovery.  Taiheiyo Cement surged 61 percent to 182 yen since the
close on March 11 last year, while  Chiyoda Corp. (6366) , a factory
builder, gained 58 percent to 1,085 yen.  Fast Retailing gained 51 percent to 18,460 yen and
 Something Holdings (1408)  surged to 207,700 yen from 25,200 yen. Toyota
Motor Corp., the country’s biggest carmaker and a bellwether for
exporters, gained 0.1 percent to 3,600 yen.  “Japan’s a classic case of the baby thrown out with the
bathwater,” said Matthews International’s Amaki. “For an
active manager like me, that presents an opportunity for us to
buy the good ones and sort out the bad.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
