MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) ’s Christine Serwinski, chief financial officer of the firm’s North American
broker-dealer, said she “did not believe it was possible” that
the firm could have a shortfall of funds of over $1 billion.  In testimony prepared for a House Financial Services
subcommittee hearing tomorrow, Serwinski said she first learned
on Oct. 27 that there was a “substantial deficit” in funds
kept in segregated accounts including customer money. However,
she said it wasn’t until the early morning hours of Oct. 31, the
day MF Global filed for bankruptcy, that she realized the
shortfall involving customer funds was real.  “I was still operating under the belief that there must
have been an accounting error because such a large deficit was
simply inconceivable to me,” Serwinski said in the testimony.  Serwinski said she had tendered her resignation on June 27
of last year, agreeing to stay on another nine months to see the
transition through.  To contact the reporters on this story:
