The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against default dropped, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  declined 5.5 basis points to 147.5 basis
points as of 8:34 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The index is headed for its lowest close since the new
series started trading on March 20, according to data provider
CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index slid 3.5 basis points to
139.3 basis points as of 11:32 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The gauge is set for its lowest close
since March 21, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell 0.5 basis points to
153.5 as of 9:42 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
