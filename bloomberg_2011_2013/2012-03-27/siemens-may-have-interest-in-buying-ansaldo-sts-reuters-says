Siemens AG (SIE)  is among companies
expressing interest in buying railway-signaling equipment
provider  Ansaldo STS SpA (STS)  from  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) ,  Reuters 
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) ,  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) ,  Alstom SA (ALS) , and  Mitsubishi
Corp. (8058)  also expressed interest in acquiring the Italian
manufacturer, Reuters said.  Alexander Becker, a Siemens spokesman, said the Munich-
based company doesn’t comment on market speculation.  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported today that Hitachi is in advanced
talks to buy 29 percent of STS and 50 percent of AnsaldoBreda,
the unit of Rome-based Finmeccanica that makes trains.
Finmeccanica,  Italy ’s biggest defense company, has said it’s
reviewing its transport units and is in talks for a partnership
for AnsaldoBreda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
