El Salvador scored in the closing
seconds of injury time to end the U.S. men’s soccer team’s
chances of qualifying for the 2012 London Olympics.  Jaime Alas’s 30-yard (27-meter) shot rolled into the net
off the hands of U.S. goalie Sean Johnson to earn El Salvador a
3-3 tie. It’s the second time since 1976 that the Americans have
missed out on the Olympics.  Johnson entered last night’s game late in the first half as
a substitute for starter Bill Hamid, who injured his left ankle
in the match at LP Field in Nashville,  Tennessee .  The U.S. trailed 2-1 at halftime. Freddy Adu set up goals
by Terrence Boyd and Joe Corona in a four-minute span of the
second half to give the American under-23 team a 3-2 lead
entering four minutes of stoppage time.  The tie left the U.S. in third place in its four-nation
group behind El Salvador and  Canada , who advance to the
semifinals.  Mexico has also reached the final four and will be joined
by Honduras, Panama or Trinidad and Tobago.  The winners of the semifinals, to be played March 31 in
 Kansas City , Kansas, qualify for the Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
