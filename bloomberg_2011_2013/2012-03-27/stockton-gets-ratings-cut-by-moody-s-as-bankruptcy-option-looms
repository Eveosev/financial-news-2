Stockton (3654MF) , the California city on
the brink of bankruptcy, had its pension-obligation and lease-
revenue bond ratings cut by Moody’s Investors Service on about
$341 million in debt.  Moody’s lowered the city’s 2007 pension-obligation bonds to
B3 from B1 and reduced the 2006 lease-revenue bonds to Caa1 from
B2, the New York-based rating company said today in a statement.
The ratings are six and seven levels below investment grade,
respectively.  The action “reflects the growing likelihood of default and
the potential for less than 100 percent recovery for bondholders
as the city continues down the path of mediation and potential
bankruptcy,” Moody’s said in the statement.  The Stockton City Council on Feb. 28 agreed to invoke a new
California law that requires cities to negotiate with creditors
before seeking bankruptcy. Stockton, an agricultural center
about 80 miles (130 kilometers) east of  San Francisco , was
forced down that path because of soaring retiree costs,
accounting blunders and the weight of the recession, City
Manager Bob Deis has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
