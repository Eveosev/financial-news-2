Fitch Ratings  downgraded the debt
of  Energy Future Holdings Co. (TXU) , the Texas power company taken
private in 2007 in the largest buyout in history. Fitch cut its
unregulated subsidiaries to eight levels below junk and said a
default appears probable.  Fitch lowered the rating of Energy Future Holdings to CC
from CCC, which “implies very high levels of credit risk such
that default of some kind appears probable at some point in the
future,” the company said in a statement.  The debt of Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Co., Energy
Future Intermediate Holding Co. and Energy Future Competitive
Holdings Co. was lowered to CC from CCC.  Projected low natural-gas prices, which set the price of
power in  Texas , are expected to lower earnings at Energy Future
Holdings’ generation unit, Fitch said in its statement. Energy
Future Holdings’ electricity retail unit, TXU Energy, also has
had “significant” customer losses and increased competition
may pressure profit margins at the unit, Fitch said.  The “current highly leveraged  capital structure ” at
Energy Future Holdings’ unregulated unit “is no longer
sustainable and some kind of default seems inevitable,”
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
