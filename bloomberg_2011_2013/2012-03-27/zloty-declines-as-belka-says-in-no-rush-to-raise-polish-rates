The Polish zloty retreated after
Governor  Marek Belka  signaled he’s prepared to wait before
raising interest rates.  The zloty weakened 0.6 percent to 4.1492 per euro as of
3:28 p.m. in Warsaw for the steepest decline among 25 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Being too late with an  interest rate  increase may be a
“lesser mistake” than raising borrowing costs only to remove
the move should the economy slow, Belka said in an interview
published today. The Narodowy Bank Polski left its benchmark
interest rate at 4.5 percent for a ninth month on March 7 as
inflation remained above the 3.5 percent upper end of the
central bank’s tolerance range since January 2011.  Belka is “happy” to keep rates on hold “just a while
yet,” Timothy Ash, head of emerging markets research at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London , said in an e-mailed
comment. “I don’t read this as saying that Belka will support
rate hikes any time soon still.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
