Everton beat Sunderland 2-0 to
advance to a semifinal against city rival Liverpool in English
soccer’s F.A. Cup, while Tottenham beat Bolton 3-1 in their
rearranged quarterfinal.  A Nikica Jelavic strike and own goal by David Vaughan at
Sunderland’s Stadium of Light sent Everton to an April 14
meeting with Liverpool at Wembley Stadium in London. Last
night’s match was replayed following a 1-1 draw on March 17.  Ryan Nelsen , Gareth Bale and  Louis Saha  scored as Tottenham
won at White Hart Lane in London. The original match was
abandoned 11 days ago after Bolton’s Fabrice Muamba suffered a
cardiac arrest on the field in the first half.  “We knew emotionally it would be difficult for all our
players,” Bolton manager Owen Coyle told his club’s website.
“The lads carried on true to the spirit and unity we have in
our football club. We’ll regroup over the next couple of days.”  Bolton said in a statement two days ago that Muamba, 23, is
making “encouraging progress” in his recovery at The London
Chest Hospital, where he remains in intensive care in a
“serious but stable” condition.  Tottenham will face Chelsea in an all- London  semifinal at
Wembley on April 15. The final is scheduled for May 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
