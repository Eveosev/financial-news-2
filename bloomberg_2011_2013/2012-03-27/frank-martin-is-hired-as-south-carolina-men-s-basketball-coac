Frank Martin was  hired  as
basketball coach at the University of  South Carolina  after
spending the past five years at Kansas State, where his teams
won at least 20 games each season.  Martin, who guided Kansas State to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association men’s tournament four times, takes over a
South Carolina program that finished in last place in the
 Southeastern Conference  last season with a 10-21 record. The
Gamecocks were 2-14 against league opponents, leading to the
firing of former coach Darrin Horn.  “I love challenges,” Martin  said  at a news conference.
“Some people run away from challenges. I run to challenges.
I’ve been doing it my whole life. It’s what I’m excited about.”  Martin, 46, had a 117-54 record at Kansas State, with a 50-
32 mark against Big 12 opponents. In his first season with the
Wildcats in 2007-08, he led the school to 21 wins and its first
NCAA tournament win since 1988.  Kansas State went 22-11 this season and advanced to the
third round of the tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
