The Muslim Brotherhood,  Egypt ’s
dominant power in parliament, has identified three potential
candidates for the country’s upcoming presidential race and will
consult senior members on which one to nominate, the state-run
Al-Ahram reported.  The Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party plans to submit
to the group’s Shura Council the names of its leader, Mohamed
Mursi, Parliament Speaker Saad el-Katatni and Khairat el-Shater,
a senior Brotherhood official, the Cairo-based daily said today,
citing Mohamed Emad el-Din, a lawmaker representing the party.
The consultative council is due to meet later today to discuss
the issue.  Emad el-Din said that an announcement was expected on March
29 and that if none of the three potential contenders met with
members’ approval, they would consider outside candidates. The
party holds 47 percent of the seats in parliament’s lower house.  The Brotherhood earlier said it was not planning on running
in the May presidential elections. The group has clashed in
recent weeks with the military rulers who took over after former
President  Hosni Mubarak  was ousted last year. It has criticized
the generals for rejecting its calls to fire the current Cabinet
on grounds that they had failed to address the country’s growing
economic problems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
