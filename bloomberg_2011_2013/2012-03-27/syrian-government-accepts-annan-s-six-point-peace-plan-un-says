The Syrian government has written
to the United Nations envoy  Kofi Annan  accepting his six-point
plan, the UN said.  Annan has written to President Bashar al-Assad urging the
Syrian government “to put its commitments into immediate
effect,” Ahmad Fawzi, Annan’s spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement from Beijing today.   “Annan views this as an important initial step that could
bring an end to the violence and the bloodshed, provide aid to
the suffering, and create an environment conducive to a
political dialogue that would fulfill the legitimate aspirations
of the Syrian people,” according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
