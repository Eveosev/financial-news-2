While U.S.  home prices  fell at a
slower pace in January, the housing market isn’t recovering as
quickly as anticipated, according to  Karl Case , co-creator of
the  S&P/Case-Shiller property-value indexes.   “I expected to see it coming back by now and it’s not,”
Case, professor emeritus as Wellesley College in Wellesley,
Massachusetts, said today in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance,” with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.  Home prices fell 3.8 percent from a year earlier in January
after declining 4.1 percent in December, according to the
S&P/Case-Shiller index of values in 20 cities. The latest
figures, released today, matched the median forecast of 32
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News. Prices are more than 34
percent below their 2006 peak.  Values rose from December in Phoenix, Washington and Miami,
and were down in all other survey places including  New York ,  San
Francisco  and Atlanta, according to the index. There were no
data available for Charlotte, North Carolina, due to delays in
reporting, according to the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
