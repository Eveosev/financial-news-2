Soybeans for July delivery are set
to rise as lingering dry weather in South America further curbs
production and  China  increases imports of the oilseed by 6.3
percent, Oil World said.  The contract may reach $14.50 a bushel “in coming weeks”
as South American output falls, the researcher said. Crops are
poised to decline in  Brazil , expected to be the largest global
soybean exporter, and  Argentina , its data show. Chinese imports
may rise to 55.6 million metric tons in the current 2011-12
season from the prior 52.3 million tons, Oil World said.  “The latest reports about small yields are indeed
alarming,” the Hamburg-based researcher said in a report today.
“Consumers have become more nervous. China has stepped up
purchases and will buy more, as the country is obviously
determined to raise soybean imports in coming months to satisfy
rising demand and raise reserve stocks.”  July-delivery soybeans slipped 0.1 percent to $13.825 a
bushel by 10:32 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade after
yesterday reaching $13.935, the highest level since September.
The contract is up 13 percent this year as dry weather cuts
yields in  South America .  Smaller Harvests  Global production of the oilseed will fall 22.7 million
tons, or 8.5 percent, to 242.9 million tons in 2011-12, Oil
World said. Southern Hemisphere output will drop 16.1 million
tons, or 12 percent, to 121.5 million tons, it said. Crops in
the Northern Hemisphere will slide 5.1 percent, or 6.6 million
tons, according to the report.  Chinese imports will rise on accelerated crushing, or
processing of soybeans into meal that’s used to make  animal
feed , Oil World said. Crushing will rise 7.9 percent to 56.3
million tons in the current season from the prior period, the
researcher said in the report. The nation is the world’s biggest
soybean importer.  “Soybean purchases have picked up noticeably owing to
improved crush margins and rising domestic requirements of soy
meal,” Oil World said. Imports will climb to “raise reserve
stocks as a cushion against any weather problems and soybean
crop scare in the U.S. this summer. We assume that this will
also require new Chinese purchases of old-crop U.S. soybeans for
shipment from April onward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
