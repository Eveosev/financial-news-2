Saudi religious police lack the
authority to prevent young men from entering malls,  al-Watan 
newspaper reported, citing Sheikh Abdul Latif al-Sheikh, the
head of the kingdom’s religious police.  Prince Sattam, the governor of  Riyadh , issued a directive
earlier this month allowing single men to enter malls during
peak hours in  Saudi Arabia . Before the decision, single men were
only allowed to enter during lunch breaks on weekdays, a policy
intended to prevent women from being harassed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
