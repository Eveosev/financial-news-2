Brazil â€™s federal tax revenue rose
12 percent in February from a year earlier, led by taxes on
companies and banks, the federal tax agency said.  The government collected 71.9 billion reais ($39.6 billion)
in the month, the agency said in a report distributed today in
Brasilia. Revenue from companies and banks climbed 33 percent
from the year earlier to 13.1 billion reais.  Taxes on cars tumbled 21 percent over the same period,
while import tariffs gained 8.6 percent on the stronger dollar,
the agency said.  The median estimate of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for tax collection of 73.1 billion reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
