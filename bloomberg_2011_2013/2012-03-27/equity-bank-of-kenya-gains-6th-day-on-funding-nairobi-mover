Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
lender by customers, gained for a sixth day, closing at its
highest level in almost three weeks, on speculation the company
will raise funds from existing shareholders.  The stock advanced as much as 2.1 percent to 19.50
shillings before trading 1.1 percent higher at 19.30 shillings
by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital, on volume that was
214 percent of its three-month average.  “The fact that it disclosed it has plans for
recapitalizations is a huge momentum driver for the stock,”
George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa
Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Equity Bank may look at raising funding next year, and is
considering options including a rights offering, Chief Executive
Officer James Mwangi told reporters on March 8. The lender has
no plans to raise funds this year, he said.  The bank’s 2011 profit surged 44 percent to 10.3 billion
shillings ($124 million) as it increased lending, especially to
small and medium-size businesses, Mwangi said. Net interest
income climbed to 19.3 billion shillings from 13.8 billion
shillings.  Lydia Kiburu, the head of communications, and Alex Muhia,
the personal assistant to Mwangi weren’t available for comment
when Bloomberg News called them today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
