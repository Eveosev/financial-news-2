Norwegian  house prices , which
haven’t declined on an annual basis since 2008, aren’t a threat
to economic growth in the Nordic country, according to the head
of its largest lender.  The economy of the world’s second-richest nation per capita
is “very robust,” with a growing population, low unemployment,
increased disposable income and interest rates that will “stay
low for a long time,” DNB ASA Chief Executive Officer Rune Bjerke said in an interview in Oslo today. “It’s really hard
for me to see signs of a bubble within the housing market.”  Norway ’s Financial Supervisory Authority warned on March 13
that the main domestic threat to the economy is an overheated
property market as borrowers bet rates will stay low. House
prices could fall “markedly,” threatening to expose the
economy to “substantial” knock-on effects, the regulator said.  Norges Bank the next day cut its  benchmark interest rate  by
a quarter percentage point to 1.50 percent, following a half
point cut in December, as policy makers judged the threat of
krone appreciation to be a more serious risk then development of
a housing bubble.  Norwegian house prices jumped 7 percent to a record last
month, according to the Real Estate Brokers Association.
Property values have risen almost twice as fast as disposable
incomes since 1992, according to data from the central bank.  Lenders in Norway are doing a “satisfactory” job of
monitoring the level of  household debt  and there are “good
controls” in place, DNB’s Bjerke said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
