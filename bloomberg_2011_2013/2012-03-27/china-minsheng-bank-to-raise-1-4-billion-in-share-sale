China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988) , the
nation’s first non-state lender, plans to raise about HK$11.2
billion ($1.4 billion) in a  Hong Kong  share sale to shore up
capital amid tightened rules for risk buffers.  The Beijing-based bank is offering 1.65 billion shares at
HK$6.79 apiece, representing a discount of 5 percent from its
last closing price on March 23, according to a statement today.
Minsheng fell 2.5 percent to HK$6.97 in Hong Kong trading as of
9:35 a.m., after dropping as much as 3.8 percent, the biggest
intraday decline in three months.  Minsheng joins local rivals  Bank of Communications Co.  and
 Industrial Bank Co. (1398)  in seeking funds after a two-year, $2.7
trillion  lending spree  drained their finances.  China ’s banking
regulator is planning tougher  capital requirements  for lenders
to fend off rising credit risks.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission said in August that
it would require the country’s largest, or so-called
systemically important, lenders to have a minimum capital
adequacy ratio of 11.5 percent by the end of next year. Smaller
banks would be required to have at least 10.5 percent under
“normal conditions” by the end of 2016, the CBRC had said.  Minsheng’s  capital adequacy ratio  stood at 10.86 percent as
of Dec. 31, while the core ratio was 7.87 percent. Both are the
lowest among the nine publicly traded Chinese lenders listed in
Hong Kong.  Boosts Ratio  The share sale may boost Minsheng’s Tier-1 ratio by at
least 55 basis points to 8.42 percent, according to an estimate
by Jim Antos, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities
Asia Ltd. The bank is required to achieve a Tier-1 ratio of at
least 8.5 percent by 2016.  In February 2011, Minsheng said it planned to issue as much
as 20 billion yuan ($3.2 billion) of convertible bonds in
 Shanghai  and sell as many as 1.65 billion new H-shares in Hong
Kong to replenish core capital.  The proceeds from the share sale will be used to improve
the capital adequacy ratio, according to today’s statement.  The lender, which has about 590 outlets nationwide, was
founded in 1996 by pig-feed tycoon Liu Yonghao and some of
China’s wealthiest businessmen. The bank has boosted profit by
an average 50 percent since 2007 by focusing on smaller
enterprises. Profit surged 59 percent to 27.9 billion yuan last
year on higher income from lending and fee-based services.  China’s publicly traded lenders have raised about $87
billion from equity markets since 2010. Credit extended to local
governments and property developers to support a 4 trillion-yuan
stimulus package sapped their financial strength.  Shanghai-based Bank of Communications said on March 15 it
plans to raise 56.6 billion yuan in the world’s biggest share
sale since May. Industrial Bank, a Chinese lender part-owned by
Hang Seng Bank Co., said earlier this month it will raise as
much as 26.4 billion yuan in a private placement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
