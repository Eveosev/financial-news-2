Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields for the first time in almost a week, as speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will maintain record-low interest rates boosted
demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.48 percent at 4:03 p.m. Lima time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The security’s price
rose 0.13 centimo to 115.62 centimos per sol.  Accommodative monetary policy is still needed to reduce
U.S. joblessness, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday.
Peruvian yields rose March 14 after the Fed raised its outlook
for the  U.S. economy , fueling speculation it won’t begin a third
round of quantitative easing and may raise interest rates.  Bernanke “is waiting to see evidence that demand is
supporting the improvement in labor markets,” said  Diego Donadio , a Latin America strategist at BNP Paribas Brasil in Sao
Paulo. “It suggests more monetary stimulus could be seen in the
U.S.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6690 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.67 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The central bank bought  $42 million  in the spot market
today to curb gains in the sol. It paid an average 2.6693 soles
per U.S. dollar, the bank said in a statement on its website.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose six basis points to 163,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
