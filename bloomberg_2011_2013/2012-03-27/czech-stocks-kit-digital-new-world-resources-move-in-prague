The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
snapped a five-day decline, rising 0.3 percent to 990.4 by the
end of trading in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, advanced 1.1 percent to 137.5 koruna, adding to a
4.7 percent rally yesterday. Benchmark European  coal  derivatives
gained 0.6 percent to $113.7 a metric ton in the Netherlands.  Kit Digital Inc. (KITD)   climbed 3 percent to 127 koruna,
extending its biggest two-day rally in two months. The maker of
online video software has been rebounding from a 27 percent drop
on March 23, which sent the stock’s 14-day relative strength
