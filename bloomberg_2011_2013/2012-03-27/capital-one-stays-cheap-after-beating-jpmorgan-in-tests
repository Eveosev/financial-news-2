Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  is
among the cheapest U.S. bank stocks, even as Federal Reserve
data show the company is better-equipped than  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  to withstand a severe economic slump.  Capital One’s projected price-to-earnings ratio for the
next 12 months is 9.59, tied with JPMorgan for the lowest among
firms in the KBW Bank Index that passed Fed stress tests this
month, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
The firm’s Tier 1 common capital ratio, a measure of its ability
to absorb losses, would be almost a percentage point higher than
JPMorgan’s in the most dire Fed test scenario.  “It’s been too cheap for a long time,” said  Ralph Cole , a
senior vice president of research at  Portland , Oregon-based
Ferguson Wellman Inc., which manages $2.9 billion including
Capital One shares. “You want a growth story, and we think in
the outer years it will be a growth story,” he said, citing
takeovers that added low-cost deposits and millions of potential
new customers for loans.  Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank spent more than
$28 billion since 2005 to transform the firm into the sixth-
biggest U.S. commercial lender by deposits, capped by this
year’s purchase of ING Direct USA. Even so, more than half of
revenue comes from credit cards, and Fairbank is expanding those
assets with a $2.6 billion purchase from HSBC Holdings Plc.
Analysts say the CEO must show he can control the added expenses
and concentration risk, and raise profit without acquisitions.  Shares Advance  Capital One’s shares have  advance d 35 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 28 percent gain for the  KBW
Bank Index. (BKX)  That made the McLean, Virginia-based firm the third-
best performer over the past 12 months in the 24-company index.
The stock hasn’t traded this high since November 2007, before
the worst of the credit crisis took hold. Back in 2006, a share
of Capital One fetched almost $90.  Only  Citigroup Inc. (C)  has a lower price-earnings ratio, at
9.33, and the New York-based lender didn’t pass the Fed’s stress
tests.  Analysts surveyed  by Bloomberg predict Capital One’s stock
could reach $62 in 12 months, an 8.7 percent rise that would top
projected returns for all of the 10 biggest U.S. lenders. A
stake equal to almost 10 percent may hit the market in coming
months. Those shares were given to ING Groep NV as part of
Capital One’s $9.1 billion purchase of the Dutch firm’s online
bank announced in June.  ING’s Overhang  “The ING shares are an issue and are keeping some
investors on the sidelines,” said  Sanjay Sakhrani , an analyst
at KBW Inc., who said their concern isn’t the most important.
“The biggest issue or risk is more along the lines of
execution,” Sakhrani said. He has an “outperform” rating on
the shares, meaning he expects the stock to return at least 15
percent over 12 months.  Fairbank has one of the industry’s biggest cushions against
losses if the economy sours, according to results of the Fed’s
stress tests. The firm’s Tier 1 common ratio, assuming the
company took no steps to  boost capital , would fall no lower than
7.2 percent in the Fed’s worst-case scenario, above the 5
percent threshold for a bank to be deemed sufficiently insulated
from an economic shock.  That’s better than 6.3 percent for JPMorgan, the biggest
U.S bank, and 6.6 percent for Wells Fargo, the largest home
lender. Capital One’s Tier 1 leverage ratio, a measure of how
much equity supports total assets, would fall to 6.2 percent,
higher than New York-based JPMorgan’s 4.5 percent.  Of the four core measures examined by the Fed, only Capital
One’s minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10.7 percent was
below JPMorgan’s 10.9 percent, the results show.  Dividend Difference  JPMorgan and Wells Fargo won Fed approval to increase
dividends and share repurchases, pushing their ratios lower.
Capital One’s ratios got a boost because the lender didn’t seek
approval to return capital to shareholders this year,  Tatiana Stead , a bank spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.  As for growth, the acquisitions of ING Direct and HSBC’s
credit-card portfolio are “vehicles to secure additional
customers,” said KBW’s Sakhrani. The HSBC deal added about $30
billion of U.S. credit-card assets, while ING Direct came with
about $83 billion of deposits. That boosted Capital One’s total
deposits to about $211 billion and vaulted the company from
eighth to sixth among U.S. banks.  Capital One can tap those funds to pitch more commercial,
auto and credit-card lending to 34 million former HSBC and ING
customers who lacked access to products that Capital One offers,
Sakhrani said. The deposits, he said, give Capital One a cheaper
source of funding that will widen net interest margins, the
difference between what the bank pays for deposits and what it
charges for loans.  Mobile Banking  Capital One, which completed the ING purchase in February,
has told ING customers who are accustomed to depositing checks
through the mail that they will be able to do that using a
computer or mobile application starting in the next few months.
Clients with ING checking accounts also can use automated teller
machines at Capital One branches, broadening their access to
fee-free ATMs.  “We can provide ING Direct’s current and potential
customers with a far wider array of customer-friendly, value-
enhancing banking products,” Fairbank, 61, said in a September
investor presentation. The combined firm “enhances and sustains
key sources of  shareholder value  over the long-term, including
increased loan volumes, strong and sustainable returns and
strong capital generation,” he said. Capital One declined to
make the CEO available to comment for this story.  Credit-Card Concentration  For now, the company still relies on credit cards, whose
“What’s in your wallet?” slogan has been ingrained on
consumers through television ads and mailings. The combination
of heavy promotion, consumer rewards and no annual fees have
made Capital One the fifth-biggest U.S. credit-card issuer by
purchases and contributed $2.3 billion of the company’s $3.1
billion of profit last year. The acquisition of the HSBC
portfolio is scheduled for completion by mid-year, boosting
assets by more than 14 percent.  Capital One’s stock looks more expensive measured by price-
to-tangible book value, which stands at 1.7. That’s higher than
the average of 1.3 for its peers, including 1.4 times tangible
book value for JPMorgan.  Headwinds include a nationwide drop in revolving  consumer
debt  to $2.95 billion in January, the first decrease since
August, according to Fed data. The total of $801 billion is down
from a September 2008 peak of $972 billion.  “Consumers have paid down debt and appropriately so,”
Cole said. Still, the decline won’t last and when borrowing
picks up again, Capital One will be one of the industry’s
leaders, he said.  Fee Squeeze  Threats to revenue from “swipe fees” charged to merchants
for each card purchase may also re-emerge. New U.S. laws have
already crimped such fees on  debit cards , and a federal anti-
trust lawsuit by merchants against banks and payment networks
over credit-card fees is scheduled for trial later this year,
according to Daniel Furtado, an analyst at Jefferies Group Inc.
A defeat could cut the $1.32 billion the firm reaped last year,
according to its fourth-quarter  supplement .  Then there’s the prospect of more dilution. Capital One
sold $1.26 billion of shares this month to help fund the
purchase of HSBC’s U.S. credit-card assets, which included co-
branded and “private-label” cards issued by retailers. That
followed a $2 billion sale in July to help cover part of the
cost of acquiring ING Direct.  Raising Alarm  In addition, on Feb. 17, Capital One issued more than 54
million shares to ING in connection with the purchase, making
the Amsterdam-based firm the largest shareholder with a stake of
almost 10 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Capital One shares slid as much as 8.2 percent on Jan. 20,
a day after the firm said a 25 percent increase in noninterest
expenses pushed down fourth-quarter profit. Management cited
technology and infrastructure needed to handle the additional
customers.  That alarmed investors and made them wary of unexpected
costs related to the transactions, said David Knutson, a credit
analyst in  Chicago  with Legal & General Investment Management.  “Fairbank did not do a very good job of preparing the
market,” he said in a phone interview. A sluggish  U.S. economy 
may weigh on card spending, Knutson said.  Among analysts, buy recommendations outweigh sell and hold
ratings by 21 to 9. Furtado at Jefferies said the bank may be
able to boost its 5-cent quarterly dividend or buy back stock in
2013, and he moved his price target to $72 from $50 in a March
19 report.  Earnings Ahead  Brian Foran, a senior bank analyst at Nomura Securities,
predicts Capital One will earn $7 a share in 2013, more than the
$6.87 consensus in Bloomberg’s survey of analysts. Foran assigns
a “buy” rating with a $54 price target for the next 12 months.  Jerrold Senser, the CEO of Institutional Capital LLC and
ICAP money manager Robert Stoll, who helps oversee $24 billion,
purchased 7.4 million Capital One shares in the fourth quarter,
making their firm the lender’s 13th-biggest owner with a 1.3
percent stake, according to Bloomberg data. Icap believes
Capital One’s purchases will boost long-term profit, Stoll said.  “A good, focused operator like Capital One can take market
share and you can take it organically, or you can buy it,”
Stoll said. “With the ING and HSBC deals, we think they bought
market share at a reasonable price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
