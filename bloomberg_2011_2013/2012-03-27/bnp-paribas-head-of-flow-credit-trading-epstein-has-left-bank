Jared Epstein left  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA
after serving as head of flow credit trading for more than two
years, a bank spokeswoman said.  Epstein, who was appointed to the position in June 2009,
previously worked for eight years at Morgan Stanley, where he
was a managing director in market-making and proprietary
trading, according to his BNP Paribas biography. Earlier, he
worked for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in structured credit
trading. Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for BNP Paribas in New
York, confirmed Epstein’s departure.  Flow credit trading is the business that serves as a
middle-man on the most liquid types of credit, compared with
proprietary trading or structured transactions.  Epstein didn’t return calls and text messages to his mobile
phone for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
