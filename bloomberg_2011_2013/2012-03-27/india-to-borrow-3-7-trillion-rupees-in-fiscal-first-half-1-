India  plans to raise 3.7 trillion
rupees ($72.7 billion) from debt sales, or 65 percent of its
annual borrowing plan, in the six months ending Sept. 30,
Economic Affairs Secretary R. Gopalan said.  The government’s net borrowings in the first half of the
financial year beginning April 1 will be 2.85 trillion rupees,
or 63 percent of the total, Gopalan told reporters yesterday.  Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee on March 16 projected
record borrowing of 5.69 trillion rupees to plug a fiscal
deficit estimated at 5.1 percent of gross domestic product in
the year starting April 1. The  Reserve Bank of India  has flagged
inflation risks from the shortfall, an oil-price surge and a
weaker rupee, while signaling readiness to lower  interest rates 
to bolster growth.  “Private credit demand picks up in the second half and the
government wants to make sure companies are able to borrow” by
making the bulk of its debt sales in the first half of the
financial year, Shubhra Mittal, an economist at  Kotak Mahindra
Bank Ltd. (KMB)  in Mumbai, said before the data was released. Weekly
debt sales in the period may be as much as 170 billion rupees,
Mittal said.  The yield on the 8.79 percent note due November 2021 rose 3
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.50 percent at close
in Mumbai yesterday, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  gained 1.2 percent and the
rupee strengthened 1.1 percent to 50.715 a dollar.  Deficit Pressure  In the budget, Mukherjee proposed to cap a subsidy program
stretching from diesel to fertilizers and raised service and
excise taxes, seeking to pare the widest fiscal gap among major
emerging economies.  He estimated the  deficit  for 2011-2012 at 5.9 percent of
GDP, wider than the 4.6 percent target set a year ago. Moody’s
Investors Service,  Fitch Ratings  and  Standard & Poor’s  have
cited public finances as hampering India’s credit rating.  India’s deficit target for 2012-2013 is “conservative and
pragmatic,” Mukherjee told lawmakers in parliament yesterday,
adding the nation can’t indulge in fiscal profligacy.  The central bank raised the  repurchase rate  by a record
3.75 percentage points from March 2010 to October last year, to
8.5 percent, to fight price increases.  Inflation in  Asia ’s third-largest economy was 6.95 percent
last month, holding close to a 26-month low. It remains the
fastest in the BRIC group, which also includes Brazil, Russia
and  China . India has the widest BRIC budget gap.  Economic expansion moderated to 6.1 percent last quarter,
the slowest pace in almost three years, as costlier credit hurt
consumer spending and dented investment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
