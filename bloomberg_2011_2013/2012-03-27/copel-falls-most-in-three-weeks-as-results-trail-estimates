Cia. Paranaense de Energia , the
largest electricity distributor in  Brazil ’s southern region,
fell the most in five months after reporting fourth-quarter
 earnings  that fell short of some analysts’ estimates.  Shares (CPLE6)  of Cia. Paranaense, known as Copel, slid 3.5 percent
to 43.19 reais at the close in  Sao Paulo , the largest loss since
Oct. 17. The stock has gained 11 percent this year. The
benchmark  Bovespa index  fell 1 percent today.  Net income attributed to the company’s controlling
shareholders rose 21 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier to 182 million reais ($100 million), Copel said in a
 statement  yesterday. Analysts expected adjusted net income of
233 million reais, the median of nine estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Copel reported weak 4Q11 results on higher-than-expected
personnel and provision expenses,” Sergio Tamashiro, an analyst
at Banco J. Safra SA, wrote in a report today. “Copel reported
208 million reais in provision expenses, almost four times our
54 million reais estimate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
