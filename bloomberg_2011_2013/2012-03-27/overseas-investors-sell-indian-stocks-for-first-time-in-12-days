Overseas  funds  were net sellers of
Indian equities for the first time in 12 sessions, pulling out
 944 million rupees  ($18.4 million) yesterday, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 39.9 billion rupees of shares and sold
40.84 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. The withdrawals contributed to the
 BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  falling to a two-month low yesterday.  The Sensex has risen 12 percent this year, poised for its
first quarterly advance since the three months ended December
2010, as foreign funds bought a net $9.1 billion of shares this
year on optimism the central bank will lower  interest rates  to
spur economic growth that moderated to 6.1 percent last quarter
from a year earlier, the slowest pace in almost three years.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last week raised its
recommendation on Indian equities because of lower risks from
the European debt crisis and the prospect of faster domestic
economic growth, while HSBC Plc upgraded yesterday its rating on
Indian stocks to overweight from neutral.  Europe  is India’s
third-largest trading partner, taking in a fifth of the Asian
nation’s merchandise exports.  Overseas investors sold a net 3.37 billion rupees of bonds
yesterday, reducing flows into debt this year to 239.1 billion
rupees, the data  show . They put 421 billion rupees in bonds in
2011. Foreigners have invested 4.893 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.446 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Flows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among
the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led
the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
