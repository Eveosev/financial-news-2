The trading card that the  National
Baseball Hall of Fame  calls the sport’s “most famous
collectible” might fetch up to $1.5 million in an online
auction that begins today, according to the dealer handling the
sale.  The 1909  card  of Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Honus Wagner
should sell for between $1.2 million and $1.5 million, said Bill
Goodwin, president of St. Louis-based sports memorabilia
auctioneer  Goodwin & Co . Arizona Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick
purchased a version of the same card with a higher grading for
$2.8 million in 2007, making that the most expensive baseball
card ever sold.  The Wagner card is part of Goodwin & Co.’s “Masterpieces
and Uncommon Commons XL,” an auction of 528 baseball cards from
the T206 series released in 1909 by the American Tobacco Co. for
distribution in cigarette packs. The lots opened today and close
on April 19, and may fetch more than $2 million total, Goodwin,
64, said yesterday in a telephone interview.  “I’ve been doing this for 26 years, and it’s got to be the
highlight of my career,” he said. “It’s very exciting, and I
feel very fortunate to be able to handle it.”  All 528 cards are owned by a man in  Texas  whom Goodwin
declined to identify. A longtime business associate of
Goodwin’s, the seller acquired the Wagner card in 1985 and
approached Goodwin in December to discuss auctioning off the
entire collection. Goodwin didn’t say how much the seller
originally paid.  Other lots in the auction include a card of former
Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Eddie Plank that Goodwin said
might be sold for around $500,000, and cards of Hall of Fame
players Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson and  Cy Young .  Minimum Bid  The Wagner card began with a minimum bid of $300,000, the
highest in the set, and reached $363,000 after three bids this
morning, according to the auction’s website.  It is graded a 3 by  Sportscard Guaranty LLC . A similar card
with the same grading sold for $145,000 in 2000 and another in
2008 went for around $950,000, according to Goodwin, who called
it the “holy grail of baseball cards.”  “Grading companies have graded 43 Honus Wagners, but only
five have been graded in higher condition,” Goodwin said.  Wagner batted .329 in 21 seasons, winning eight National
League batting titles and five stolen base crowns. The second
player behind Cap Anson to reach 3,000 hits, Wagner was part of
the inaugural 1936 class at the Cooperstown, New York-based
National Baseball Hall of Fame, and died in 1955.  The Hall of Fame has a T206 Honus Wagner available for
public viewing in its museum. A plaque beneath the card reads,
“Wagner’s fame, the scarcity of the card and the story behind
it make this baseball’s most famous collectible.”  Unique Plank Card  The Plank card is graded 5.5, also by SGC, and has a unique
“Piedmont 150” back. All other known Plank cards that feature
the rare backing were cut from the original sheets, Goodwin
said.  “The theory was that this card never reached the cigarette
packs, but this particular one obviously has,” Goodwin said.
“It’s the only one with this back to receive a numerical
grade.”  Plank, who died in 1926, won 284 games with the Athletics
from 1901 to 1914, and World Series titles with the team in 1911
and 1913. He joined the St. Louis Terriers in the Federal League
in 1915, a year before moving to the  American League ’s St. Louis
Browns. The first left-handed pitcher to win 300 games, Plank
was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1946.  The auction lots close at 10 p.m. New York time on April
19, when those who placed a previous bid can continue to
increase their offer. Each lot officially ends when there have
been no bids for 15 minutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
