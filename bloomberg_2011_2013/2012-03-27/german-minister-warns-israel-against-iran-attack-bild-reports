German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere said he warned Ehud Barak, his Israeli counterpart,
against an attack on  Iran ’s nuclear installations, as the risks
would be “incalculable,”  Bild  reported, citing an interview.  “Some in the Israeli government underestimate the negative
consequences of such an attack,” the newspaper quoted de
Maiziere as saying. “As friends of  Israel  we have urgently
advised them against this step.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
