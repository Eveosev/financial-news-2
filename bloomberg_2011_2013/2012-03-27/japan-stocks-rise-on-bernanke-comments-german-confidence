Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) ,
after more than a year, recovered to the closing level on the
day of the earthquake and tsunami that left 19,000 people dead
or missing and triggered the worst nuclear disaster in 25 years.  Shares on the benchmark gauge surged 2.4 percent, the most
in six months, to 10,255.15, rising in the final two seconds of
trading above the closing price on March 11, 2011. Topix Index
gained 2.4 percent to 872.42, the most among major equity gauges.  Japanese stocks led a global rally that came after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled a commitment to
relaxed monetary policy. The advance got a boost because today
was the last to buy shares and still get a dividend for about
four-fifths of the 1,668 companies listed on the Topix.  “It is profound that the market has finally made back its
losses, but we have a long way to go toward true
reconstruction,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at
Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which manages about $302 billion.
“It took a long time, but honestly it was shocking the yen
surged that much after the quake. The stronger yen had held the
stock recovery back.”  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets more than 80 percent
of its sales abroad, rose 3.5 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s top bank by market value, gained 4.3 percent
after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  signaled readiness to do
more to tame Europe’s debt crisis. Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.
jumped 5.9 percent after discovering a new gold deposit.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The gauge added 1.4 percent in  New York  yesterday
to close at its highest level since May 2008 after Bernanke said
that while he is encouraged by a drop in the U.S. unemployment
rate, the Fed needs to continue accommodative monetary policy to
further cut joblessness.  Exporters Advance  Exporters gained, with Honda rising 3.5 percent to 3,270
yen. Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker by market value,
increased 3.6 percent to 3,600 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s
biggest camera maker, climbed 3.5 percent to 4,015 yen.  Finance shares gained after German Chancellor Merkel gave
her first indication she is prepared to allow an increase in the
debt-crisis firewall, saying that  Germany  could let the
temporary and permanent rescue funds run in parallel. Mitsubishi
UFJ gained 2.8 percent to 436 yen.  “The Fed’s stance to support the economic recovery through
policy easing and adding liquidity to the market is helping
boost sentiment,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , a senior  fund manager 
in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees $6
billion. “Worries about  Europe ’s debt crisis are being swept
away.”  Nikkei Rebound  The Nikkei 225 has risen about 25 percent since its low in
November amid signs of a U.S. economic recovery, optimism on
containing Europe’s debt crisis and additional monetary easing
by the Bank of Japan. Shares in the Japanese benchmark are
valued at 24.3 times estimated earnings on average, compared
with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Sumitomo Metal Mining rose 5.9 percent to 1,231 yen after
the company said it found an additional deposit of as much as 40
tons of gold at its Pogo mine in Alaska.  Among the biggest gains on the Topix were small-cap
developers. Hoosiers Corp. surged 12 percent to 74,000 yen,
while Sun Frontier Fudousan Co. gained 11 percent to 17,640 yen.  Land Prices Surge  Property prices in Japan’s northeastern region that were
hurt by the earthquake and tsunami gained the most last year as
residents sought to relocate, the land ministry’s annual land
price report showed last week.  “Expectations that housing demand, including condos, will
rise boosted shares as a land-price recovery spurs expectations
for economic expansion,” said Hideyuki Shinkai, a fund manager
at Norinchukin Trust & Banking Co.  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (7012) , a transport equipment and
heavy machinery maker, gained 4.8 percent to 263 yen. Nomura
Holdings Inc. analyst Ryo Tazaki raised the stock’s rating on
prospects for the U.S. motorcycle market to show its first
operating profit in five years. He also upgraded the company on
expectations Chinese construction machinery market has bottomed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
