German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
coalition agreed to delay cuts in aid for some ground-based
solar-power plants by six months until Sept. 30, lawmakers said.  The change is an exemption to a bill that would start
subsidy reductions in  Germany , the world’s biggest solar-power
market, on April 1. Merkel’s government aims to cut the annual
pace of solar installations by half after incentives for the
industry pushed capacity past government targets.  “We are putting in place significant restrictions on the
cost of solar power,”  Michael Kauch , a Free Democratic Party
lawmaker who helped draft the bill, said in an e-mailed
statement. Merkel’s Christian Democratic caucus confirmed the
amendments in a separate statement.  Under the changes, subsidy cuts for solar plants built on
sites such as former garbage dumps or former military bases will
be waived until Sept. 30, according to the statements.  Subsidies would automatically decline further if solar
capacity expands more than the government’s goal of between
2,500 megawatts and 3,500 megawatts per year, according to the
statements. If installations lag behind that pace, the aid cuts
would be eased.  Subsidies for power fed into the grid from rooftop units
would apply to 80 percent of the generated electricity, compared
with 85 percent in an earlier draft. The change is aimed at
spurring homeowners to use more of their own solar power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
