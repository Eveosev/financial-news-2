The yuan snapped a two-day decline
after the central bank set a record fixing for the third day as
Chinese President  Hu Jintao  told U.S. President Barack Obama the
country will allow a more flexible exchange rate.  China  plans to “let the market play a greater role” and
increase flexibility of the yuan, Hu told Obama in a meeting in
Seoul yesterday, according to a statement on the foreign
ministry website. Hu said yuan appreciation won’t solve the U.S.
trade deficit and unemployment. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said yesterday continued accommodative monetary policy
will be needed to create jobs, weakening the dollar.  “Hu’s remarks and the fixing give signals that the yuan
will continue its appreciation path, although that could be a
bit bumpy on the uncertain global economic outlook,” said
Patrick Cheng, a Hong Kong-based foreign-exchange analyst at
Haitong International Securities Co. “The expectations on
another round of quantitative easing also boosted demand for
non-dollar assets.”  The yuan gained 0.11 percent to close at 6.3072 per dollar
in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency has declined 0.2 percent this quarter, the
first loss since 2009.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s  reference rate  at
6.2840 per dollar today, the strongest level since the nation
ended a dollar peg in July 2005 and 0.48 percent higher than
yesterday’s closing price of 6.3140. The currency is allowed to
move as much as 0.5 percent on either side of the fixing.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.07 percent
to 6.3138. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards increased 0.08
percent to 6.3347, a 0.4 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility for the yuan, a measure of
 exchange-rate  swings used to price options, fell 10 basis points
to 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
