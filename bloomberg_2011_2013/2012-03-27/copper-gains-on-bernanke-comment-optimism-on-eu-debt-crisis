Copper climbed for a third day,
supported by signs of improvement in the  U.S. economy  and
progress in containing  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  Three-month copper rose as much as 0.4 percent to $8,567 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $8,549 by
3:54 p.m. Tokyo time. The metal has risen 12.5 percent in the
first three months, the most since the quarter ended Dec. 31,
2010. Comex May-delivery metal was little changed at $3.8860 a
pound.  Asian  stocks  rose the most in two weeks after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that while he’s
encouraged by the unemployment rate’s drop to 8.3 percent,
further improvement in the job market will require continuing
the central bank’s stimulative monetary policies.  “Risk appetite improved,”  Mark Pervan  and Natalie Robertson, analysts at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ) , said in a report today. “Copper prices are expected to
trade within a range, as conflicting views regarding slowing
Chinese growth against U.S. accommodative policy initiatives
sway the market in different directions.”  The market is closely watching U.S. data forecast to show
orders for durable goods increased in February. In the U.S.,
bookings for long-lasting U.S. factory goods rose 3 percent last
month, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg before the Commerce Department releases its figures
tomorrow.  Copper Inventories  The metal rose as much as 2.3 percent yesterday after a
report showed German business confidence unexpectedly gained and

for the temporary and permanent euro-area rescue funds to run in
parallel. European finance ministers will meet on March 30 to
discuss raising a 500 billion-euro ($664 billion) ceiling on the
region’s financial firewall.  Copper inventories monitored by the LME fell 0.5 percent to
254,000 tons, the lowest level since November 2008, daily
exchange figures showed. Orders to draw the metal from LME
warehouses, or canceled warrants, declined 0.5 percent to 85,050
tons.  The metal for delivery in June on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed 0.9 percent to close at 60,710 yuan ($9,626) a
ton. On the LME, aluminum was little changed at $2,189 a ton and
zinc added 0.4 percent to $2,027 a ton. Lead gained 0.3 percent
