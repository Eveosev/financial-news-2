Cotton rose to a three-week high on
speculation that demand will climb for exports from the U.S.,
the world’s top shipper, as India maintains a partial ban on
sales.  Orange juice  slid.  India, the second-biggest grower, halted exports of the
fiber this month to secure domestic supplies. While the measure
was partially lifted, registration for additional cargoes won’t
be allowed until further notice. In the week ended March 15,
U.S. shipments were 297,122 running bales, led by purchases from
 China , the top user. That was “well above” the pace needed to
reach the government’s export projection of 11 million bales for
the season ending July 31, INTL FCStone Inc. said on March 22.  “Good U.S. cotton sales are the main supportive factor in
the market,” analysts at Rabobank International, including Luke Chandler, said in a report. This is “likely a result of buyers
switching from  India  supplies after the export ban,” according
to the bank.  Cotton for May delivery climbed 1.8 percent to settle at
92.59 cents a pound at 2:41 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Earlier, the price reached 93.18 cents, the highest for a
most-active contract since March 6. This quarter, the price has
climbed 0.9 percent, heading for the first gain in a year.  Global inventories as of July 31, 2013, will climb 11
percent from a year earlier, the   International Cotton Advisory
Committee  said on March 1. The surplus is equivalent to 60
percent of global mill use, the largest stocks-to-use ratio
since the late 1990s, the Washington-based group said.  Increasing stockpiles and “slowing Chinese buying and
sluggish demand in the second quarter are expected to weigh on
markets,” Rabobank said. A probable rebound in U.S. output,
which slumped last year after the worst drought in at least a
century in  Texas , the top producing state, is also “bearish”
for prices, the bank said.  A running bale weighs 500 pounds, or 227 kilograms. The
projection of 11 million is in statistical bales, which weigh
480 pounds each.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery declined 0.6 percent
to $1.672 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
