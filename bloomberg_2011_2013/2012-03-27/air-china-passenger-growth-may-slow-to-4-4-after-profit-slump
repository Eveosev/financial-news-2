Air China Ltd. (753) , the world’s biggest
airline by market value, predicted that passenger growth may
slow to 4.4 percent this year after reporting a worse-than-
expected decline in 2011 profit.  The carrier, including units, may fly 72.8 million
travelers this year, compared with 69.7 million last year, it
said in a Shanghai stock exchange  filling  late yesterday. Net
income declined 41 percent last year to 7.08 billion yuan ($1.1
billion) under international accounting standards.  China ’s biggest international carrier expects passenger
growth to cool from last year’s 16 percent because of economic
concerns in China, the U.S. and  Europe . The company also faces
rising fuel costs with  prices  having averaged about 10 percent
higher in Singapore trading in 2012 than a year earlier.  “With capacity growth and weaker demand growth, the
airline is likely to face difficulties in growing passenger
yields,” said Richard Wei, an analyst with UBS AG. “The rising
jet-fuel price is also expected to hurt profit-margins
further.”  Net income  last year fell after the carrier’s fuel expenses
rose 44 percent to 34.7 billion yuan because of higher prices
and increased flying. The contribution from a stake in  Cathay
Pacific (293)  Airways Ltd. also slumped 68 percent to 959 million yuan
after year-earlier one-time gains. Air China holds about 30
percent of Cathay Pacific.  Shares Decline  The Beijing-based carrier, which is part-owned by Cathay
Pacific, fell 0.2 percent to HK$5.11 in  Hong Kong  trading. It’s
tumbled 12 percent this year, compared with an 11 percent
decline for  China Southern Airlines Co. (1055)  and an 8.3 percent drop
for China Eastern Airlines Corp.  Air China’s sales rose 19 percent last year to 98.4 billion
yuan. Earnings per share fell to 0.58 yuan from 1.03 yuan. The
carrier was expected to make a 2011 profit of 8.9 billion yuan,
based on the average of eight  analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  The airline’s groupwide yields, a measure of average fares,
increased 6.3 percent to 0.68 yuan per revenue passenger
kilometer, it said in a press release.  The carrier proposed a final  dividend  of 0.118 yuan a share,
little changed from a year earlier.  Air China, including units Air Macau and  Shenzhen Airlines ,
filled 81.5 percent of seats last year with paying customers, an
increase of 1.4 percentage points. On international routes, the
 load factor  fell by 1.2 percentage points compared with a 2.8
percent rise on domestic routes.  The group fleet totaled 432 planes at the end of last year,
according to a press release. That included 288 planes in the
main Air China unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
