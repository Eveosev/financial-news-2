There is no plan to sell a stake in
Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB, owner Mohammed Hussein Al-

offers and requests from investors to participate; none of these
has been accepted or even studied seriously, al-Amoudi told the
 newspaper .  On March 25, the Financial Times cited Chief Executive
Officer Fredrik Ohrn as saying the company was up for sale and
might fetch $2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
