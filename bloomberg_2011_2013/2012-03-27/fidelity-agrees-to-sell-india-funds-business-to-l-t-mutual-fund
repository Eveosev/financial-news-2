Fidelity Worldwide Investment, the
world’s second money manager, is selling its Indian business to
a unit of the country’s biggest engineering company seven years
after entering  India ’s $135 billion mutual fund market.  Fidelity’s Indian unit managed 88.8 billion rupees ($1.7
billion) of  assets  at the end of 2011, according to Association
of  Mutual Funds  of India, an industry group.  L&T Mutual Fund’s second purchase in three years will help
the company almost triple its assets to 134.96 billion rupees,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The industry manages a total
6.87 trillion rupees in stocks and bonds, according to the data.  “The purchase catapults L&T Mutual into the top league in
rankings because of Fidelity’s large equity assets,” Dhirendra
Kumar, managing director at Value Research, a firm that tracks
funds, said by phone from  New Delhi . “L&T was struggling to
find fund managers. The sale works for Fidelity as it would have
to shell out a substantial chunk if it had to pay severance to
employees.”  The sale comes two months after billionaire Anil Ambani’s
 Reliance Capital Ltd. (RCAPT)  sold a stake in its fund management unit
to Nippon Life Insurance Co. Nippon Life paid about 22 billion
yen ($287 million) for 26 percent of India’s second-largest
money manager, valuing it at 6.6 percent of its 843 billion
rupees of assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mutual-fund assets in India have dropped 15 percent since
peaking in November 2009, after the country banned firms from
charging investors a fee at the time of purchase, according to
AMFI. The restriction caused distributors, which previously
shared the fee with the manager, to reduce marketing.  T. Rowe Price Group Inc. bought a 26 percent stake in UTI
Asset Management Co. in 2009 that valued India’s oldest money
manager at 3.3 percent of its money under management. L&T Asset
acquired DBS Cholamandalam Asset Management that same year for
450 million rupees, or 1.6 percent of the managed assets.  India’s benchmark  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  dropped 25 percent last
year, the worst performer among  Asia ’s 10 biggest markets. It
gained 17 percent in 2010 and 81 percent in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
