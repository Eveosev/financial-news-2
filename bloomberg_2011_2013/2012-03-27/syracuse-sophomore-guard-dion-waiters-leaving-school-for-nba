Syracuse University sophomore guard
Dion Waiters will  enter  this year’s National Basketball
Association draft after a season in which he was second on the
team in scoring even though he wasn’t a starter.  The 6-foot-4 Waiters averaged  12.6 points  while coming off
the bench in all 37 games for the Orange, who won a school-
record 34 games. Waiters, who was named the Big East
Conference’s Sixth Man of the Year, also averaged 2.5 assists,
1.3 steals and was third on the team in three-pointers made.  Waiters is projected as a possible first-round pick by
 NBAdraft.net  on June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
