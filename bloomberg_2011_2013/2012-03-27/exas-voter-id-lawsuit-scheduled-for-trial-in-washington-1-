A dispute over  Texas ’s new law
requiring voters to show government-issued photo identification
at the polls is scheduled for trial beginning July 9 before
three federal judges in  Washington .  Texas, which sued the U.S. seeking permission to enforce
its photo ID requirements, pushed for a quick trial, telling the
federal court that it needs a ruling by Aug. 15 to implement the
law in time for the November election.  The trial is scheduled to last five days and won’t focus on
Texas’s allegations that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is
unconstitutional, according to today’s order from Circuit Judge
David Tatel and district judges Rosemary Collyer and Robert Wilkins.  The Justice Department on March 12 used its power under the
Voting Rights Act to block the Texas law, saying in a letter to
the state that the measure may disproportionately harm Hispanic
voters. The department in December stopped a similar law in
 South Carolina (NFSESC) .  Texas is among 16 states, or jurisdictions within states,
that must obtain permission from the  Justice Department  or a
federal court in Washington before redrawing their district
lines or changing election procedures because of a history of
voting rights violations.  The case is State of Texas v. Holder, 12-00128, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
