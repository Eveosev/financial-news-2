India ’s bonds declined, pushing the
10-year yield to its highest level of 2012, on speculation the
government will announce plans to borrow the majority of its
annual debt target in the six months beginning April 1.  The  finance ministry  and the central bank will hold talks
today to decide the fundraising calendar for the first half of
the next fiscal year. The government will borrow a record 5.69
trillion rupees ($112 billion) in the 12 months through March
2013, compared with 5.1 trillion rupees this year, Finance
Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said March 16. Higher oil costs may
deter policy makers from lowering  interest rates  next month,
said M. Natarajan, the Mumbai-based head of treasury at Bank of
 Nova Scotia .  “Investors are jittery as the borrowing program could be
frontloaded,” he said. “ Oil prices  also continue to be a
worry.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.50 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s
the highest rate for the debt since Dec. 30. The government may
borrow as much as 65 percent of its target in the first half,
said Natarajan.  Brent crude oil has risen 17 percent this year to $125.50 a
barrel.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao raised
the repurchase rate by 3.75 percentage points from the beginning
of 2010 to October last year, lifting the benchmark to 8.5
percent in an attempt to restrain inflation. The next review is
scheduled on April 17.  Fastest Inflation  Indian refiners have held gasoline prices unchanged since
December, while diesel prices haven’t been raised since July.
Surging crude prices may prompt refiners to raise fuel prices,
stoking inflation, Natarajan said.  The central bank may cut the repurchase rate by less than
100 basis points in the 12 months beginning April, said Richard Iley, chief economist for  Asia  at BNP Paribas SA on March 19,
reducing an earlier forecast for 200 basis points of reductions
to reflect “stickier” inflation and a potential increase in
the  budget deficit .  Inflation in Asia’s third-largest economy remains the
fastest in the BRIC group, which also includes Brazil, Russia
and  China , eroding purchasing power in a nation where more than
two-thirds of the population lives on less than $2 a day.  The benchmark wholesale-price index rose 6.95 percent last
month from a year earlier, after climbing 6.55 percent in
January, the commerce ministry said this month.  The government plans to reduce the budget deficit to 5.1
percent of gross domestic product in the next fiscal year from
5.9 percent this year, Mukherjee said on March 16, unveiling the
government’s spending and taxation plans.  One-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, decreased two
basis points to 8.12 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
