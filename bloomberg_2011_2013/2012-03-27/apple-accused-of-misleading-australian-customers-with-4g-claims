Apple Inc. (AAPL)  misled customers in
Australia with claims the new iPad connects to 4G networks, when
that’s not the case, the competition regulator said.  The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission said in a
 statement  today it will seek court orders in Melbourne tomorrow
that will include injunctions, monetary penalties and refunds to
customers. Fiona Martin, an Apple spokeswoman in Sydney, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.  “The ACCC alleges that Apple’s recent promotion of the new
‘iPad with WiFi + 4G’ is misleading,” the regulator said in a
statement today. “It represents to Australian consumers that
the product ‘iPad with WiFi + 4G’ can, with a SIM card, connect
to a 4G mobile data network in  Australia , when this is not the
case.”  The new iPad,  advertised  as 4G compatible, uses the 700
megahertz and 2,100 megahertz frequencies for 4G services.
Telstra Corp. operates Australia’s only working 4G network,
which uses the 1,800 megahertz frequency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
