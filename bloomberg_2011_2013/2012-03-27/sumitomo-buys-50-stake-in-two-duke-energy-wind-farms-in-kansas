Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  of America, a unit
of Japan’s third-largest trading company, bought a 50 percent
stake in two wind-energy projects  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  is building
in Kansas.  The deal includes Duke’s 131-megawatt Cimarron II and 168-
megawatt Ironwood projects in Gray and Ford counties, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based utility holding company said
today in a statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  Construction of both projects will be completed this year,
and Duke is “exploring opportunities to finance the cost of
constructing and operating” the projects with Sumitomo, it
said.  Kansas City Power & Light Co. will purchase the output of
Cimarron II, and Westar Energy Inc. has a contract to buy the
electricity generated by Ironwood.  To contact the reporter on this story:
