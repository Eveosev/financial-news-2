The  Detroit Red Wings  beat the
Columbus Blue Jackets 7-2 to earn a National Hockey League
playoff berth for the 21st straight season, the longest current
run in professional U.S. sports.  Tomas Holmstrom had two goals while Pavel Datsyuk had a
goal and an assist for the  Red Wings , who opened a 6-0 lead
after two periods last night at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit.  With the win, Detroit broke the previous franchise record
of 20 consecutive postseason trips from 1939-58.  Detroit (46-25-5) is the third team in the Western
Conference to clinch a playoff berth, following the St. Louis
Blues and Vancouver Canucks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
