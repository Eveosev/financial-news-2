Investors chasing gains in stocks
may help drive the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  to 1,440 in
coming weeks while leaving the market vulnerable to losses once
the so-called “window dressing” is over, UBS AG said.  The S&P 500 has climbed 13 percent since the end of last
year, poised for the best first quarter since 1998, amid better-
than-forecast earnings and economic data. Financial companies
and computer makers rose the most among 10 groups, surging at
least 22 percent so far in 2012. The S&P 500 would need to rise
1.7 percent to reach 1,440 from yesterday’s closing level of
1,416.51.  Peter Lee, the New York-based chief technical analyst for
UBS, said fund managers’ purchases of the  best-performing  stocks
at the end of the quarter are likely to push the  S&P 500  toward
his 2012 target range of 1,440 to 1,450 sooner than the second
half of the year, as he had anticipated. A failure of the
benchmark index to hold gains above these levels may trigger a
pullback of 5 percent to 10 percent, he said.  “When the quarter has been extremely strong, these
institutional investors are pressured or motivated to dress up
their portfolios to show clients that they actively participated
in the marketplace during the quarter,” Lee wrote in a note
yesterday. “The focus on momentum stocks and sectors leaves the
overall market vulnerable for a correction.”  The rally has prompted  hedge funds  to reduce bearish bets
on equities and buy stocks at the fastest rate in two years. A
gauge of hedge-fund bullishness measuring the proportion of bets
that shares will rise climbed to 48.6 last week from 42 at the
end of November 2011, the biggest increase since April 2010,
according to data compiled by the International Strategy &
Investment Group.  The range of 1,440 to 1,450 corresponds to the S&P 500’s
intraday high in May 2008 and an extension of a trend line drawn
from the gauge’s 12-year low in March 2009, according to Lee.
The index, now 9.5 percent below an all-time-high of 1,565.15
reached on Oct. 9, 2007, has stayed within a  900-point range 
since 1997.  “The rally from March 2009 bottom is a cyclical rally
operating within the contexts of a structural sideways trading
range market environment,” Lee wrote. “This would then suggest
the cyclical recovery/rally will eventually come to an end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
