AMR Corp.’s  American Airlines  wants
to keep information related to a proposed rejection of union
contracts out of public view so it can’t be used by competing
airlines.  AMR filed court papers today seeking a judge’s approval to
reject labor agreements with three unions. American wants to
file documents or portions of documents related to the request
under seal, it said in a filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Manhattan.  “Public release of the confidential material could
compromise the debtors’ competitive position by allowing its
competitors a critical glimpse into the debtors’ financial inner
workings,” American said.  AMR, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, is seeking court
permission to reject the labor contracts as part of its
bankruptcy reorganization and an effort to cut labor costs.  The case is In re  AMR Corp. (AMR) , 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
