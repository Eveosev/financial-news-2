An Egyptian administrative court
said it will issue a ruling on April 10 in a case contesting the
legitimacy of a newly-chosen constitutional committee.  Administrative Court Judge Ali Fikri adjourned the session
after a hearing pitting supporters of the committee against
those who filed over 10 separate complaints calling for the
panel not to include any members of parliament.  The committee, which was named on March 25, is evenly made
up of lawmakers and other individuals. The Muslim Brotherhoodâ€™s
Freedom and Justice Party, the Al-Nour Party, which is linked to
the Salafist movement that adheres to a strict interpretation of
Islam, and other Islamists who are not part of parliament, hold
almost 60 seats on the panel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
