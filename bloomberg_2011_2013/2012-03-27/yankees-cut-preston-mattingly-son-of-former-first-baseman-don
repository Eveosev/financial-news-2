The  New York Yankees  released
minor-leaguer Preston Mattingly, a former first round draft pick
who is a son of the team’s former All-Star first baseman and
current Los Angeles Dodgers manager  Don Mattingly .  Preston Mattingly, 24, never reached the major leagues in
six years of professional baseball after being selected with the
31st pick in the 2006 draft by the Dodgers. The Yankees signed
him as a free agent in January, and he was playing in their
minor-league spring-training camp before being released, team
spokesman Jason Latimer said in an e-mail.  Mattingly, 24, batted .232 with five home runs, 19 runs
batted in and five doubles last season, finishing with the
Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, the Dodgers’ advanced Class-A
affiliate.  Don Mattingly, who became Dodgers manager in September 2010
when  Joe Torre  resigned, played his entire 14-year career for
the Yankees, retiring in 1995. He had a .307 career batting
average, 222 home runs and 1,099 runs batted in, was selected as
an All-Star six times and won nine Gold Glove Awards for his
play at first base.  To contact the reporter on this story:
