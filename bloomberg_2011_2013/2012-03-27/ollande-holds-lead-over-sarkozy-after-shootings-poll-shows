Socialist Francois Hollande
maintained his lead over French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  for
the runoff round as the Toulouse killings this month had little
effect on the presidential campaign, a poll showed.  Hollande would win a head-to-head race in the May 6 second
round 54 percent to 46 percent, according to a biweekly  Ifop
Fiducial  poll for Europe 1 radio, Paris Match and Public Senat.
The last survey gave him a 54.5 percent to 45.5 percent lead.  Sarkozy leads Hollande for the April 22 first round by 28.5
percent to 26.5 percent. Sarkozy’s score was unchanged from the
previous survey, while Hollande lost 0.5 percentage point in the
10-candidate race.  The survey was carried out March 22 to 25 among a sample of
1,769 people. The margin of error is about 2.1 percentage
points.  On the morning of March 22, after a 32-hour siege that was
covered live on French television stations, police killed
Mohamed Merah, a self-declared jihadist who had murdered three
soldiers, three Jewish children, and a French-Israeli teacher in
a nine-day-long killing spree.  A separate BVA poll released today showed the Toulouse
events haven’t made security a major issue. Only 8 percent
listed “security” as a major influence on their vote, well
behind purchasing power at 42 percent and unemployment at 30
percent. Eighty-one percent said the Toulouse events weren’t
important in their voting choice.  The BVA poll, commissioned by newspaper  Le Parisien, 
involved 890 people questioned on March 26.  The Ifop poll showed a continued drop in support for anti-
immigrant candidate Marine Le Pen, whose backing fell by half a
point to 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
