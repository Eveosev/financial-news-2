Two U.S. representatives
attended meetings today at a World Trade Organization forum “to
advocate for market-determined exchange rates as a foundation of
an open global trading system,” the  U.S. Treasury  said.  Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Punke and Mark Sobel, Treasury deputy assistant secretary for international
financial policy, are attending the two days of meetings in
Geneva,  Switzerland , the Treasury said in a statement.  “When trading partners believe others are allowing their
exchange rates to adjust in line with fundamentals, there is
less pressure for protectionism and more support for trade
liberalization,” Sobel said in the release.  To contact the reporters on this story:
