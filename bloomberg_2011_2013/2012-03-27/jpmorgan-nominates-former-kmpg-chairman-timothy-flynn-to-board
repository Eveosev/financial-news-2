JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, nominated former KPMG International Chairman Timothy P. Flynn to its board as two directors step down after more than
a decade at the company.  Flynn, 55, was the accounting firm’s chairman from 2007
through October and served as the U.S. division’s chief
executive officer from 2005 through 2008.  William Gray , chairman of consulting firm Gray Global
Strategies Inc., and David Novak, president and CEO of  Yum!
Brands Inc (YUM) ., aren’t seeking re-election, New York-based JPMorgan
said today in a statement. Gray is a holdover from his 1992
appointment to the board of  Chase Manhattan Corp. (3285Q)  Novak was
carried over from the Bank One Corp. board he joined in 2001.  JPMorgan has advanced 39 percent this year through
yesterday. The stock gained 11 cents to $46.28 as of 11:44 a.m.
