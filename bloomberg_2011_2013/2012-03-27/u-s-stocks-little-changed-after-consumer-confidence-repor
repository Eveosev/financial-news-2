U.S. stocks remained little
changed, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index trading near its
highest level since May 2008, after consumer confidence held
close to the strongest in a year.  The  S&P 500  was up less than 0.1 percent at 1,417.0 at
10:03 a.m. in  New York .  The Conference Board’s confidence index dropped to 70.2 in
March from a revised 71.6 reading in February that was higher
than initially reported, figures from the New York-based private
research group showed today. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a decrease to 70.  The S&P 500 yesterday erased last week’s decline after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that accommodative
monetary policy is still needed to spur jobs.  The index rose 3.7 percent in March through yesterday,
poised for a fourth straight monthly gain, the longest winning
streak since 2009. It trades for 14.6 times reported earnings,
the highest valuation level since July while still below the
average since 1954 of 16.4.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
