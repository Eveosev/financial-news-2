Colombia ’s peso bonds gained,
sending benchmark yields to a two-week low, as concern eased
that inflation will quicken in the South American country.  The yield on the country’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in 2024 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point to 7.23 percent in Bogota, according to the central bank.
The bonds’ price rose 0.502 centavo to 122.048 centavos per
peso.  Colombian central bankers held the benchmark rate at 5.25
percent on March 23, saying investors’ inflation expectations
were falling, after increases at both their January and February
meetings. The gap between yields on government inflation-indexed
bonds due in 2013 and similar-maturity fixed-rate debt, a gauge
of annual consumer price increase expectations, fell to 3.15
percentage points today from 4.07 percentage points on Feb. 17,
the highest this year.  “The stabilizing inflation expectations are definitely a
factor,” said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Corredores Asociados SA.  The annual inflation rate held near a six-month low in
February, indicating Banco de la Republica’s nine interest rate
increases in the past 13 months have helped contain consumer
demand growth as the economy expanded. Colombia’s economy
expanded at the fastest pace since 2007 last year, led by a
surge in oil and mining exploration.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 1,763.80 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,760.75 yesterday. It has gained 9.9 percent this year, the
second-biggest advance after the Mexican peso among major Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
