UAC of Nigeria Plc , a food-products
maker and fast-food restaurant operator, fell for a third day
after its dividend plan for 2011 disappointed investors, Lambeth
Trust and Investment Co., a Lagos-based brokerage, said.  UAC will pay an annual dividend of 1.5 naira per share, the
company said in a statement released at the stock exchange in
Lagos and distributed by Vetiva Research today. The company is
yet to announce its full-year results, Vetiva said. Company
results in  Nigeria  are usually distributed by the bourse to
brokerages before they are posted on its website.  The stock lost 1.52 naira, or 4.9 percent, to 29.83 naira
by 1:14 p.m. in Lagos. A close at this price will be its longest
losing streak since March 14.  “The stock is falling because the distribution is not
encouraging,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth,
said by phone from Lagos today.  UAC reported a second-quarter profit of 7.8 billion naira,
including 5.5 billion naira earned from the sale of a 49 percent
stake in UAC’s food division to  Tiger Brands Ltd. (TBS)  of  South
Africa , Securities Africa Ltd., a Johannesburg-based brokerage,
said at the time.  “People expected that this extraordinary income would be
distributed to shareholders,” Adonri said. “Given that
extraordinary income, analysts were forecasting  a dividend per
share of 4 naira.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
