Shougang Corp., the sixth largest
steelmaker in  China  by production, says  iron ore  prices may fall
to “reasonable levels” as new supply of the steelmaking
ingredient comes onstream.  “We think prices are still too high,” President Wang Qinghai said today in an interview in  Singapore , without
providing further details. Prices have gained 5.2 percent this
year.  Chinese steelmakers are in a difficult situation because
prices of steel products haven’t changed significantly, he said.
The company is studying overseas acquisitions, especially in
iron ore, and haven’t identified any targets yet, he said.  For Related News and Information:
