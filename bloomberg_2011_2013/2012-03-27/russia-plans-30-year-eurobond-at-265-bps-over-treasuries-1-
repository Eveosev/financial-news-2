Russia  plans to sell $7 billion of
bonds in three maturities as soaring oil prices boost confidence
in the world’s biggest energy exporter.  Russia may sell $3 billion of dollar-denominated bonds due
in 2042, which may be priced to yield between 250 and 255 basis
points more than U.S. Treasuries, according to a banker with
knowledge of the deal, who declined to be identified because the
transaction isn’t public yet. The  Finance Ministry  is also
offering $2 billion of five-year notes at 230 to 235 basis
points over Treasuries and $2 billion in 10-year debt at a
spread from 240 to 245 basis points, or 2.45 percentage points,
the banker said.  The nation’s  main export oil blend  has jumped 16 percent
this year, pushing the yield on Russia’s existing 2030 dollar
bonds to within two basis points of a record low on March 9.
Russia, which achieved a budget surplus of 0.8 percent of gross
domestic product last year, registered to sell as much as $7
billion of securities in its first offering of dollar bonds
since April.  “I expect the demand to be strong,” Morten Groth, who
helps oversee $1.7 billion of debt at  Jyske Bank A/S (JYSK)  in
Sikeborg,  Denmark , said by e-mail. “The first price guidance
looks quite okay, but it’s also a decent amount, $5 billion to
$7 billion as far as I have been told.”  Yields on 30-year U.S. Treasuries at 3.313 percent today
would put Russia’s rate at 5.81 to 5.86 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. When Russia last issued 30-year bonds in
2000, the government paid interest at 7.5 percent. It paid 12.75
percent for 30-year bonds sold in 1998.  The 2030 dollar bonds yielded 4.17 percent today, or 83
basis points over U.S. Treasuries.  The average spread for Russian dollar-denominated bonds
rose three basis points to 275 basis points today, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
