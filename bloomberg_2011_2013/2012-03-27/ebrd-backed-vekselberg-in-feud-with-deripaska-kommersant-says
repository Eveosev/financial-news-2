The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development backed United Co. Rusal
billionaire shareholder Victor Vekselberg in a dispute with
Chief Executive Officer  Oleg Deripaska  over a power station,
 Kommersant  reported.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said in December that
Vekselberg had agreed to sell the Bogoslovskaya power station to
Rusal. A sale would help Rusal control electricity costs for its
nearby aluminum smelter. The two parties have since failed to
agree on a price, Kommersant said.  The EBRD owns almost 8 percent of Vekselbergâ€™s OAO TGK-9
utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
