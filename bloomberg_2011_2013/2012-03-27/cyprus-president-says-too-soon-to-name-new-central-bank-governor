Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said it’s too soon to announce the next governor of
the  Central Bank of Cyprus .  “There is a date on which the governor’s term expires,”
he said today in an emailed statement from the Press and
Information Office in Nicosia. “When the time is right we will
announce names.”  Daily newspaper Politis reported that Christofias has
already appointed Panicos Demetriades, a U.K.-based academic, to
succeed  Athanasios Orphanides , whose term expires on April 30.
Demetriades, who is professor for financial economics at the
University of Leicester, declined to comment.  Cyprus is one of the 17 nations sharing the euro and its
central bank governor sits on the European Central Bank’s
Governing Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
