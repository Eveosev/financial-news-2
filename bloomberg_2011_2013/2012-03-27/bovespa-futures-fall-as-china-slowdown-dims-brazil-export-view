Bovespa-index futures fell,
signaling the stock gauge may retreat from yesterday’s gain, as
signs of a slowdown in China spurred concern that demand for
Brazilian exports will falter.  Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3) ,  Brazil ’s third-biggest
steelmaker, may move after reporting fourth-quarter net income
of 831.8 million reais ($456.8 million), which compares with the
average estimate of 610.8 million reais in a Bloomberg survey of
nine analysts.  Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-ore producer,
may be active after it was raised to the equivalent of buy at
Morgan Stanley.  Bovespa futures fell 0.4 percent to 66,785 at 9:26 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.8202 per  U.S.
dollar .  Industrial companies in China posted their first January-
February profit decline since 2009. Net income dropped 5.2
percent from a year earlier to 606 billion yuan ($96.1 billion),
the National Bureau of Statistics said on its website yesterday.  “The main downside risk for the Bovespa is a deeper
slowdown in  China ,” Renato Bandeira de Mello, head of equity
trading at Futura Corretora, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “The
Bovespa depends heavily on China, which is a big export market
for many listed companies.”  Brazil’s benchmark equity  measure  has advanced 17 percent
this year, heading to its biggest quarterly gain since the
period ended September 2009. Stocks have been buoyed by
interest-rate cuts in  Latin America ’s largest economy, signs of
growth in the U.S. and speculation  Europe  may be closer to
solving its debt crisis.  The Bovespa trades at 10.8 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, which compares with a 10.6 ratio for MSCI Inc.’s
measure of 21 developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Traders  moved  5.29 billion reais in stocks in  Sao Paulo 
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 7.19 billion reais this year through March 16,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
