Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ,  India ’s largest
wind-turbine maker, will deliver 332 megawatts of offshore
turbines to a German North Sea project being developed by  PNE
Wind AG. (PNE3)   Suzlon’s Repower Systems SE agreed to supply 54 turbines to
the Gode Wind I wind farm 35 kilometers (22 miles) north of the
Frisian Islands, Pune-based Suzlon said today in a web
 statement . No terms were disclosed.  Companies including Alstom SA and  Siemens AG (SIE)  are developing
6-megawatt offshore  wind turbines  as nations including France
and the U.K. seek to reduce costs of the energy-saving
technology.  Germany  is targeting 10 gigawatts of wind power in
its seas by 2020 from about 200 megawatts now while the U.K.
plans to reach 18 gigawatts by the same year.  Repower has sold 150 of its 6.15-megawatt offshore machines
to date including to Gode Wind, according to the statement. The
facility, developed by Cuxhaven, Germany-based PNE Wind, will
generate enough power for 324,000 homes when built, Suzlon said
in the statement. The project will be commissioned in 2015,
according to Suzlon.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
