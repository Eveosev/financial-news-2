Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) ,  Italy ’s biggest
defense company, forecast a return to profit this year after
reporting a record loss for 2011 because of writedowns.  The manufacturer swung to a net loss of 2.35 billion euros
($3.13 billion) last year after a 493 million-euro profit a year
earlier, it said in a statement distributed by the Italian
exchange today. The company won’t pay a dividend for 2011.  Finmeccanica posted an adjusted loss before interest,
taxes, amortization and restructuring of 216 million euros in
2011. That compares with a median analyst estimate of a 237
million-euro loss in a Bloomberg survey. The Rome-based company
forecast 2012 adjusted Ebita of about 1.1 billion euros.  The state-controlled contractor said it booked writedowns
and one-time charges of 3.2 billion euros in 2011, including
writedowns tied to a components contract for  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787
airliner and “changing business outlook” at its DRS
Technologies Inc. unit in the U.S. amid cuts in the U.S. defense
budget. Analysts had estimated a net loss of 2.13 billion euros,
based on the average of 10 estimates.  Chief Executive Officer Giuseppe Orsi took over as chairman
on Dec. 1 after Pier Francesco Guarguaglini stepped down amid a
corruption probe involving company executives.  Orsi, who is undertaking Finmeccanica’s biggest overhaul in
at least a decade, is targeting asset sales of 1 billion euros
this year to focus on military businesses and profitable
aeronautics contracts. The company is reviewing its transport
units and is in talks for a partnership for the AnsaldoBreda
trainmaker.  Finmeccanica rose 11 percent today to 3.85 euros after  Il
Sole 24 Ore  reported that  Hitachi Ltd (6501)  is in advanced talks to
buy 50 percent of AnsaldoBreda and 29 percent of  Ansaldo STS
SpA (STS) , the signaling unit. Orsi said at a press conference today
in Rome that the goal is to sell AnsaldoBreda this year. General
