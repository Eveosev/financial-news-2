The Economic Community of West
African States suspended  Mali  from the regional bloc, following
the March 22 coup that ousted Malian President Amadou Toure.  A delegation headed by Ivory Coast President and Ecowas
Chairman  Alassane Ouattara  will head to Mali within the next 48
hours to enable a “quick return to constitutional order,” said
Kadre Desire Ouedraogo, president of the Ecowas commission. His
comments followed a special meeting in Abidjan.  “Mali needs to see the immediate return of the normal
functioning of its democratic institution,” Ouattara said.
“President Amadou Toumani Toure is alive, he is in good
health.”  The delegation will include Benin President Thomas Boni Yayi, Burkina Faso President Blaise Comparoe, Liberian President
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Niger President  Mahamadou Issoufou  and
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
