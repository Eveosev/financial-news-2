Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) , Mexico’s biggest
construction company, named Chief Operating Officer Alonso Quintana as its next chief executive officer, replacing Jose Luis Guerrero Alvarez.  Quintana, 38, the son of Chairman Bernardo Quintana, will
take the job on July 1, the Mexico City-based company said today
in a filing to the country’s stock exchange. He became COO in
July 2011 after serving as chief financial officer starting in
2007.  His promotion to COO was part of what ICA said last year
was a “leadership transition process” set in motion in 2007
when Guerrero Alvarez was appointed as CEO and Bernardo Quintana
retained the chairman’s title. Guerrero will retire while
remaining a director at ICA, the company said.  ICA “embarked on a phase of growth and increased
profitability” during Alonso Quintana’s CFO tenure, as he led
several international equity and bond offerings and efforts to
obtain financing for projects such as  Mexico ’s La Yesca dam,
Bernardo Quintana said in the statement. The younger Quintana
joined ICA in 1994.  ICA shares rose 1 percent to 24.21 pesos in Mexico City
today. The shares have risen 43 percent this year,  compared with 
a 4.8 percent increase for the Mexican stock exchange’s IPC
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
