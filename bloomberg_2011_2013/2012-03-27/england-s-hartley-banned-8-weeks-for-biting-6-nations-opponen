England  rugby team hooker Dylan
Hartley was suspended eight weeks for biting an opponent during
the Six Nations tournament.  Hartley was cited for biting the finger of Ireland’s
Stephen Ferris in the first half of England’s 30-9 home win on
March 17. A Six Nations disciplinary hearing upheld the ruling
of foul play in issuing the ban, which runs until May 13 and can
be appealed, tournament organizers said in a statement.  “I am disappointed by the result and I will wait for the
written judgment as to how to panel came to their conclusion,”
Harley said in a statement from the Rugby Football Union. “  Hartley is set to miss the rest of the season for his club
Northampton, unless the Saints reach the Premiership final on
May 26. He is eligible for England’s tour of  South Africa  that
begins June 9.  The disciplinary committee judged Hartley’s offense to be
low-end, which carry bans ranging from 12 to more than 24 weeks
in the International Rugby Board’s list of recommended
sanctions, and allowed mitigation of four weeks. The maximum
sanction for a high-end offense is a four-year suspension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
