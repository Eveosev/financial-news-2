The single market for  investment
banking  is starting to fragment across the European Union, the
region’s top regulator warned today.  Andrea Enria, chairman of the  European Banking Authority ,
said there are “signs, unfortunately” that banks’ shedding of
assets is making them less active in other EU nations, he said
at an event in Brussels today.  The cost of international business increasing is
“definitely a threat at the moment,” Gernot Mittendorfer,
chief risk officer at Erste Group Bank AG, said in an interview.
“The European idea is basically about single market,
integration, freedom of capital.”  Officials from  Austria ’s central bank and financial
regulators imposed tougher rules last year on loans to Eastern
European countries, restricting their banks to lending no more
than 110 percent of local deposits and funding raised by
subsidiaries.  The EBA, set up last year to harmonize banking rules across
the European Union, has meanwhile told banks to raise 114.7
billion euros ($153 billion) in fresh capital by the end of June
as part of measures introduced to respond to the euro area’s
sovereign-debt crisis. The EBA has said it won’t count so-called
deleveraging as part of the capital-raising measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
