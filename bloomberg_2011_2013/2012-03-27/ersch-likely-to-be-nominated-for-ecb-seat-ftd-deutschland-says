Luxembourg Central Bank governor
Yves Mersch will probably be nominated by euro-area finance
ministers this week for a seat on the board of the  European
Central Bank , the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing
unidentified people.  Mersch has already secured the necessary backing for
nomination in preference to the Spanish candidate, Antonio Sainz
de Vicuna, the newspaper said.  Spain  may demand that one of its nationals be appointed to
head the euro areaâ€™s permanent rescue fund in return for
withdrawing Vicuna from the ECB race, the FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
