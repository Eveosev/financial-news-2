Austria is sticking to plans for a
financial-transaction tax in  Europe  to help consolidate its
budget, even as  Germany ’s finance minister sees little chance of
a European Union agreement on the levy.  Countries that back the tax can and should introduce it to
raise funds and funnel investments away from speculative
products and into the “real economy,” Vice Chancellor Michael Spindelegger told journalists after the weekly government
meeting in Vienna today. Chancellor Werner Faymann reiterated
his plan to start a EU-wide referendum on the plan.  “Just because others are getting cold feet doesn’t mean we
should let go as well,” Spindelegger said when asked about
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble’s comment yesterday
that the tax won’t be introduced in the euro area.  Austria , where both government and opposition support the
levy, plans to reduce its deficit by 26.5 billion euros ($35.4
billion) in the five years to 2016, and has budgeted the
financial-transaction tax to contribute 500 million euros
annually from 2014. It also relies on more than 1 billion euros
coming from an accord with  Switzerland  under which wealthy
Austrians’ funds on Swiss accounts would be taxed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
