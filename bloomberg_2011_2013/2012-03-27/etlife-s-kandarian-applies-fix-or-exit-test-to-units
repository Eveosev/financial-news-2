MetLife Inc. (MET) ’s  Steven Kandarian ,
who has presided over an 18 percent stock decline in less than a
year as chief executive officer, told investors he is prepared
to cut the insurer’s weakest businesses to boost results.  “We are committed to achieving returns in excess of our
long-term cost of capital,” Kandarian, also MetLife’s chairman,
said in a letter posted on the New York-based company’s  website 
yesterday. “We will not achieve this goal overnight. But over
time, we will fix or exit businesses that cannot consistently
clear their hurdle rates.”  MetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, underperformed the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  three of the last four years as it
expanded by acquisition and became the No. 1 seller of variable
annuities. Kandarian, promoted from chief investment officer in
May, has retreated from businesses in  Taiwan  and the U.K. and
started unwinding MetLife’s banking unit. Variable-annuity sales
will be curbed in 2012, MetLife said in December.  “We are committed to taking a portfolio view of our
businesses,” Kandarian said in the letter, which accompanied
the insurer’s annual report and was dated March 16. “No
business is automatically entitled to capital. All must compete
on the basis of which will deliver the most value to
 shareholders .”  The  S&P 500  rose about 4 percent through yesterday since
Kandarian, 60, took over as MetLife CEO from Robert Henrikson.
The index has advanced 13 percent since Dec. 31, less than the
23 percent gain in MetLife.  Buyback, Dividend  The exit from banking will reduce oversight from U.S.
regulators and give MetLife the ability to buy back stock and
raise its dividend, the company has said. The curbs on equity-
based variable annuities will decrease risk, while the
businesses in the U.K. and Taiwan weren’t able to meet
Kandarian’s standard for returns, MetLife has said.  Kandarian agreed to sell about $7.5 billion of  bank
deposits  to General Electric Co. and planned the elimination of
most of the 4,300 jobs at MetLife’s mortgage-origination
operation. Kandarian, whose plan to buy back stock was rejected
this month by the  Federal Reserve , reiterated in the letter that
MetLife will deregister as a  bank holding company  by the end of
the second quarter.  “MetLife remains committed to creating  shareholder value 
and returning excess capital to shareholders,” Kandarian said.  MetLife fell 30 percent last year, compared with little
change in the S&P 500. The insurer rose 1.4 percent in 2009,
while the S&P 500 surged 23 percent, and fell 43 percent in 2008
as the index slid 38 percent. MetLife beat the S&P 500 in 2010
when the insurer gained 26 percent, compared with the 13 percent
advance in the index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
