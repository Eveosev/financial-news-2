German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told lawmakers in Berlin that he sees no scenario
under which the current euro-area rescue fund, the European
Financial Stability Facility, will have to issue new bailouts in
the next three months, a ruling party official said.  No new rescues will have to be made between now and the
establishing of the permanent fund, the European Stability
Mechanism, at the beginning of July, Schaeuble told lawmakers
from his  Christian Democratic Union  today, the CDU official told
reporters on condition of anonymity because the meeting was held
in private.  Schaeuble said that the EFSF bailouts will keep running
alongside the ESM once it is set up, but that the rest of the
EFSF pot wonâ€™t be transferred to the permanent fund, the
official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
