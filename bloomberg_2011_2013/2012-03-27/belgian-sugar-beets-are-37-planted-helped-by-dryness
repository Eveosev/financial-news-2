Belgium â€™s sugar-beet crop was 37
percent planted as of yesterday as sowing was helped by dry
conditions, the Royal Belgian Institute for Beet Improvement, or
KBIVB, reported.  Farmers had planted about 22,910 hectares (56,612 acres) on
March 26, the institute said in a  report  on its website today.  Rainfall since the start of February has been about half of
normal values, with 62 millimeters (2.44 inches) of rain between
Feb. 1 and the end of March compared with a long-term average of
116 millimeters for the two months, KBIVB wrote.  Forecasts are for the next 15 days to remain dry, according
to the institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
