Virginia  approved construction of a
wind turbine in Chesapeake Bay that may be the first installed
in U.S. waters.  The state’s Marine Resources Commission granted permission
to  Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) ’s U.S. unit to install a 5-
megawatt prototype three miles (4.8 kilometers) from the town of
Cape Charles, according to a statement today from Virginia
Governor Bob McDonnell.  The single-turbine test, which requires approval from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, may be completed faster than other
planned wind farms off the U.S. Atlantic coast that have been in
development for years, according to the statement.  Gamesa,  Europe ’s second-largest turbine maker, selected
Virginia for the test in part because of the state’s “unique
and efficient permitting process adopted for small energy
projects,” McDonnell said in the statement. The project must
also be reviewed by the U.S. Coast Guard.  Gamesa is working with  Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII) ’s
shipbuilding unit and construction is scheduled to be completed
in late 2013. The blade will reach a maximum height of 479 feet
(146 meters) above the surface and the tower will be installed
in 53 feet of water.  Cape Wind Associates LLC has been planning a 468-megawatt
project in Nantucket Sound for more than a decade and has faced
opposition from environmental groups.  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)  suspended work on a proposed offshore wind
farm in Delaware and put its Bluewater Wind unit up for sale in
December, after failing to find investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
