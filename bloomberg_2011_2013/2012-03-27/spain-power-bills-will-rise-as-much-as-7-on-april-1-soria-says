Spanish consumer power bills will
rise as much as 7 percent next month, enough to cover just a
fraction of the revenue shortfall in the electricity system,
Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria said.  Power companies and the state will have to fund more than
80 percent of the cost to eliminate the so-called tariff deficit
under regulations due to be unveiled on March 30, Soria said.  “Consumers can’t cover the whole adjustment,” Soria said
today in an interview on  Spain ’s Antena 3 television. “That
would mean an increase in power bills of up to 40 percent.”  Spanish homes and businesses were allowed to run up debts
to utilities of 23 billion euros ($30.7 billion) as successive
administrations agreed that power suppliers should book more
revenue than they were permitted to collect.  The gap widened during the past five years, swollen by
subsidies added to customer bills to support renewable-power
plants, energy-efficiency projects and coal mines as well as for
poorer families and consumers on the country’s islands.  Some of those extra charges may be stripped out of power
bills as another measure to narrow the deficit, Soria said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
