Cyrela Brazil Realty (CYRE3)  SA
Empreendimentos & Participacoes, Brazil’s second-biggest real-
estate company by revenue, reported fourth-quarter net income
that beat analysts’ estimates as a result of strong cash
generation.  Net income more than doubled to 181 million reais ($100
million) from 83 million reais a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-
based company said in a regulatory filing late yesterday. That
exceeded the average estimate for net income of 175 million
reais among nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Cyrela’s  shares  rose 1.6 percent to 18.09 at 10:56 a.m. in
 Sao Paulo , while the benchmark Bovespa stock index gained 0.3
percent.  Cash generation in the quarter was 130 million reais,
compared with negative cash generation of 492 million reais in
the same period of 2010.  “Overall, the lack of detailed disclosure regarding the
good cash generation in the quarter ended up preventing Cyrela
from consolidating itself as the first player able to generate
cash on a sustainable basis,”  Credit Suisse AG (CSGN)  analysts
Guilherme Rocha, Daniel Gaparete and  Vanessa Quiroga  wrote in a
report today. They have a neutral rating on the stock.  Cyrela’s net sales increased 43 percent to 1.98 billion
reais in the fourth quarter. The company aims to achieve sales
of 6.9 billion reais to 8 billion reais in 2012, according to
the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
