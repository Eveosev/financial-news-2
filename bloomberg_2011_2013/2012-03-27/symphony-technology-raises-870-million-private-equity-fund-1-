Symphony Technology Group, a
private-equity firm focused on software and technology services,
completed fundraising for a new $870 million investment fund.  As with previous funds, the largest investor is the firmâ€™s
founder, Romesh Wadhwani, according to a statement today from
the  Palo Alto , California-based company. It currently has 14
companies in its portfolio.  Symphony acquires large stakes in public and private
companies worldwide and then focuses on improving operations and
boosting profit margins. The firm started buying shares of
Finnish software developer  Aldata Solution Oyj (ALD1V)  in 2007 and now
owns about 90 percent of the company. In 2009, it acquired MSC
Software Corp., the developer of simulation software for
manufacturers.  Before starting Symphony, Wadhwani founded Aspect
Development Inc., which was acquired for $5.6 billion in 2000.
Before that, he started Cimflex Teknowledge Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
