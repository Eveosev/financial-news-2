Oil supplies advanced 3.6 million
barrels to 351.5 million last week, the  American Petroleum
Institute  said.  Distillate fuel inventories  declined 1.45 million barrels
to 136.6 million, the APIâ€™s weekly report showed.  Gasoline
stockpiles (APISMGAS)  rose 1.34 million to 226.3 million.  Crude at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, gained 1.05 million
to 39.6 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  The government report may show supplies of oil rose 2.55
million barrels last week, according to the median of 12
responses in a  Bloomberg News (DOEASCRD)  survey of analysts. Gasoline
inventories probably dropped 1.55 million barrels, the survey
showed. Distillates were expected to slip by 500,000 barrels.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for May delivery fell 9 cents to $106.94 a barrel
at 4:34 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract, which settled at $107.33, traded at
$107.06 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
