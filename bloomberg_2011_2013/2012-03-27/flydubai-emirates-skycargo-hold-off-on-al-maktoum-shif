FlyDubai and Emirates airline’s
cargo unit said they’ll wait until they need more capacity
before moving operations to  Dubai World Central ’s new  Al Maktoum 
International Airport scheduled for completion in 2013.  “We are definitely considering it for the future,”
FlyDubai, the Persian Gulf emirate’s low-cost carrier, said
today in an e-mailed statement. At the same time, runway
capacity growth at the existing Dubai International Airport will
allow “continued route network expansion in the years ahead.”  Mohsen Ahmad, director of operation development at the
sheikhdom’s Dubai World Central logistics complex, said in an
interview today that FlyDubai will shift some flights to Al
Maktoum when the terminal opens for passenger flights by early
2013. Emirates, the world’s largest airline by international
traffic, will also shift its freight operations there, he said.  Emirates SkyCargo “has not finalized any plans to move to
another airport” from Dubai International, the carrier said in
a statement today. “The facilities at Dubai World Central are
impressive and, as our operations grow beyond the current
capabilities at Cargo Mega Terminal, we are obviously looking at
DWC as a possible alternative.”  Dubai World Central is being designed as a trucking and
air-transport hub centered on Al Maktoum, which is being
developed by Dubai Airports Co., with links to nearby rail and
sea terminals. Paul Griffiths, chief executive officer of Dubai
Airports, said in a phone interview that there are no current
plans to shift either Emirates SkyCargo or FlyDubai operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
