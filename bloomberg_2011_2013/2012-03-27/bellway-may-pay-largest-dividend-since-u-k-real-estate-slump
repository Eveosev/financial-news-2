Bellway Plc (BWY)  may pay its biggest
second-half dividend since 2007 after the U.K. homebuilder’s net
income climbed 64 percent in the first half, Finance Director
Keith Adey said in an interview.  Bellway, based in Newcastle, England, aims for a payout of
12 pence a share for the six months through July, up from 8.8
pence a year earlier, Adey said. The company announced a first-
half dividend of 6 pence today.  “You’d hope to double that at the final,” Adey said today
by telephone. “We’ll retain roughly two-thirds of the earnings
within the business and pay a third out to shareholders.”  Homebuilders are widening profit margins by focusing more
on houses and developing land bought after prices dropped during
the global financial crisis. The U.K. government is trying to
spur construction after homebuilding in  England  and  Wales  fell
in 2010 to the lowest during peacetime since 1924.  Bellway fell 20.5 pence, or 2.4 percent, to 839 pence in
 London , the most since Feb. 21. The shares gained 6.1 percent
yesterday. Bellway has climbed 18 percent this year, while the
Bloomberg EMEA Home Builders Index has advanced 32 percent.  Unlike most publicly traded U.K. homebuilders, Bellway paid
a dividend during the residential real-estate slump. In 2007,
the company said it would pay 26.7 pence a share in the six
months through July 2007.  ‘Safe Return’  “What we’re trying to do is balance our strategy of volume
growth with having a safe and ongoing annual return to
shareholders,” said Adey, who replaced Alistair Leitch as
finance director in January.  Net income rose 30.4 million pounds ($49 million) in the
six months through January from 18.5 million pounds a year
earlier, Bellway said today. Operating margin gained 320 basis
points to 10.1 percent as a result of building on cheaper land
acquired during the recession. One basis point is the equivalent
of 0.01 percentage point.  “There remains an underlying demand for our homes,”
Chairman Howard Dawe said in the statement. “The group
therefore intends to continue its three pronged strategy of
delivering volume, selling price and operating margin growth.”  Revenue increased 12 percent to 459 million pounds as the
average selling price rose 8.5 percent to 182,753 pounds.
Bellway said it will pay the 6 pence dividend on July 2.  The company completed 2,455 homes compared with 2,332 a
year earlier, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
