Jose Antonio Ocampo, the former
Colombian finance minister and one of three candidates to become
the next president of the  World Bank , expects Latin American and
the Caribbean nations to support his bid.  There is a “real possibility” the contest to lead the
Washington-based lender will be open to candidates from
developing countries, Ocampo said in an interview with RCN Radio
today.  The bank’s executive board will choose between Ocampo,
Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Dartmouth
College President Jim Yong Kim, at a meeting April 20. Ocampo
said that while he and Okonjo-Iweala are better qualified, there
is a “high probability” that Kim, a Seoul-born U.S. citizen,
will be named president of the bank, which has always been led
by an American.  The U.S. customarily makes the appointment as the biggest
shareholder in the IMF.  Colombia ’s government won’t back Ocampo’s candidacy to lead
the World Bank, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said
March 22. The country is already well represented in  Washington 
by Luis Alberto Moreno, the president of the Inter-American
Development bank, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
