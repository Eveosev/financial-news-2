The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt fell for a second day on
speculation policy makers will bolster support for the economic
recovery.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 16 basis points to
574.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 10:30 a.m. in
London. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 2.75 basis points to 115. A
decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Investors are betting European Union rescue funds will be
raised to 940 billion euros ($1.26 trillion) and the  Federal
Reserve  will offer a third round of quantitative easing after
Chairman Ben Bernanke yesterday signaled he will continue to
stimulate the  U.S. economy . A report today may show U.S.
consumer confidence held near a one-year high.  “Anything QE-related helps the market and the prospect of
having the EU bailout fund enlarged is viewed as positive,”
said Harpreet Parhar, a strategist at  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  in
London. “People will start to realize Bernanke never
specifically mentioned QE and even a 940 billion euro firewall
is unlikely to be a game changer for the sovereign debt
crisis.”  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell 3.5 basis points to 200 and the
subordinated index declined seven to 316.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
