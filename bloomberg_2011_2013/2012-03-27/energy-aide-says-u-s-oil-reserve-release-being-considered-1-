The U.S. is weighing the option of
using its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ease potential supply
restrictions, an Energy Department official said, echoing
comments by Secretary Steven Chu in recent weeks.  “It is being considered,” Charles McConnell, acting
assistant secretary for fossil energy, said at a hearing in
Washington today of the House Appropriations subcommittee  on
Energy and Water Development. “It has been in consideration for
some time, and no decision has been made.”  The Obama administration is studying a possible release
from the reserves as it monitors rising gasoline prices and
political turmoil in the  Middle East , Chu and Interior Secretary
 Ken Salazar  said separately on Feb. 28. They haven’t indicated
that the U.S. will tap its emergency petroleum supply.  Crude oil for May delivery fell 6 cents to $106.97 a barrel
at 1:09 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The price
reached $107.73 before falling to $106.52 after McConnell spoke.
Futures have gained 8.3 percent this year.  “I wasn’t speaking about any specific release from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve,” McConnell said at the hearing,
clarifying his remarks.  McConnell’s office in the Energy Department needs to be
ready to respond should the government decide to release from
the stockpile, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
