The 2012 National Football League
season will open with a game between the Super Bowl champion New
York Giants and the  Dallas Cowboys  on Sept. 5 at MetLife Stadium
in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  This will be the ninth consecutive year the defending
champion has hosted the season-opening game, the Giants said in
a news release. The home team won the previous eight games,
including last season’s victory by the  Green Bay Packers  over
the  New Orleans Saints .  This season’s opening game was moved to Wednesday from
Thursday to avoid a conflict with President Barack Obama’s
speech at the Democratic National Convention, the Giants said.  The Giants beat the Cowboys twice in the final four weeks
of last season, including a 31-14 win at MetLife Stadium on Jan.
1 that clinched the National Football Conference East division
title.  That regular-season finale averaged 27.6 million viewers,
the most for a primetime NBC game and the largest audience for
any primetime NFL game since 1996, NBC said in a news release.  The Giants finished the regular season with a 9-7 record
before winning four consecutive postseason games and their
second  Super Bowl  in five seasons. The Cowboys finished the
regular season 8-8 and lost a tiebreaker with the Philadelphia
Eagles to finish third in the division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
