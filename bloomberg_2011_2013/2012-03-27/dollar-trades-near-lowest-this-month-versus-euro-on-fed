The dollar rose against the euro
and the yen as U.S. economic data indicated a strengthening
recovery, undermining the case for more stimulus from the
 Federal Reserve .  The U.S. currency gained from the lowest level this month
against its 17-nation European counterpart as reports showed
home-prices declines slowed and  consumer confidence  this month
stayed close to the highest level in a year. The Dollar Index
advanced as Treasuries rose after the highest pre-auction yields
since July spurred stronger-than-average demand at a government
sale of $35 billion in two-year notes. The measure had dropped
the past two days amid speculation the Fed will start a third
round of quantitative easing, or QE3.  “The dollar is benefiting from generally upbeat assessment
of the  U.S. economy ,” said  Samarjit Shankar , a managing
director for the foreign-exchange group in  Boston  at Bank of  New
York  Mellon, the world’s largest custodial bank, with more than
$26 trillion in assets under administration. “We’re gradually
entering an investment regime where risk-on is not necessarily
bad for the dollar. From a flow perspective, we’re still seeing
the euro as one of the strongest net sold across the board.”  The dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.3313 per euro at
5 p.m. New York time. It fell earlier to as low as $1.3386, the
least since Feb. 29, when it reached $1.3486. The U.S. currency
added 0.4 percent to 83.17 yen. The euro rose 0.1 percent to
110.75 yen, after gaining 1.6 percent during the past two days.  Biggest Losers  Norway’s krone and  Australia ’s dollar fell the most against
the dollar among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The krone fell 0.5 percent to 5.7040 per dollar and the Aussie
dropped 0.7 percent to $1.0460.  The Aussie fell to a two-month low last week as concern
increased growth in China, Australia’s biggest trading partner,
is slowing. Chinese industrial companies’ net income decreased
5.2 percent from a year earlier in the first two months of 2012,
the nation’s statistics bureau said today. That compared with a
34.3 percent gain in the same period last year.  “These currencies, like the Aussie, just ran out of gas to
some extent,” said  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group-of-10
foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York.
“There’s a bit of skepticism vis-a-vis  China  and without China
supporting commodities, it’s not easy to put on those trades.”  The pound may tumble against the dollar to depths not seen
in more than a quarter century as it strengthens toward a level
last surpassed nearly four years ago, Citigroup Inc. said.  Resistance from the 200-week moving average of $1.6014,
coupled with a trend line dating back to 2007 and the currency
pair’s February high, may stop the pound’s year-to-date gains
and push it back to $1.3255, last hit in 1985, according to Jim Zhou, an analyst at the Citigroup Global Markets unit in New
York.  The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.5951.  Annual View  The yen has depreciated 10.7 percent this year, the worst
performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar has fallen
2.6 percent, and the euro has gained 0.4 percent.  “Investors shouldn’t take any one place as a safe haven,”
 Axel Merk , founder and president of the  Palo Alto , California-
based firm, said in a television interview on “Surveillance
Midday” with  Tom Keene . “You just can’t put all your money in
any one place -- it is a race to the bottom and the major
economies are racing faster than the smaller economies.”  The implied volatility for three-month euro-dollar options,
which indicates expected swings in the underlying currencies,
was fell 0.3 percent to 9.91 percent. It reached 9.83 percent,
the least since August 2008. The  JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index (JPMVXYG7) 
has tumbled to 9.95 percent from 12.34 percent on Jan. 2.  Franc Trades  The franc rose against the euro after falling yesterday by
the most since March 19. The Swiss currency had weakened Economy
Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said he would “generally
like” the franc to weaken toward 1.35 or 1.40 versus the euro.  The  Swiss National Bank  said in September it would cap the
franc at 1.20 per euro after it touched a euro-era record
1.00749 in August.  The franc rose 0.1 percent to 1.20540 per euro after
falling by as much as 0.1 percent yesterday.  The dollar has weakened against 15 of its 16 major peers in
2012. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday stoked speculation
the central bank will embark on a third round of asset
purchases, saying stimulative policy is still needed to reduce
joblessness.  “Further significant improvements in the  unemployment rate 
will likely require a more-rapid expansion of production and
demand from consumers and businesses, a process that can be
supported by continued accommodative policies,” he said in a
speech in Arlington, Virginia.  Fed Plans  “Bernanke indicated that the door is wide open to QE3,”
said  Ulrich Leuchtmann , head of currency strategy at Commerzbank
AG in  Frankfurt . “As long as the market think QE3 might happen,
then that will be negative for the dollar. We have seen two
spectacularly bad days for the dollar and now we are losing a
bit of momentum.”  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of
quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011. The U.S.
central bank has held its target interest rate at a range of
zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 U.S.
cities fell 3.8 percent from a year earlier, matching the median
forecast of 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, after
decreasing 4.1 percent in December, a report from the group
showed today in New York.  The Conference Board’s confidence index dropped to 70.2
from a revised 71.6 reading in February that was higher than
initially reported, figures from the New York-based private
research group showed today. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a decrease to 70.  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s  Dollar Index , used to
track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners,  gained  0.2 percent to 79.144.  To contact the reporters on this story:
