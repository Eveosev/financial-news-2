On Track Innovations Ltd., a
developer of digital payment technology, sued  Deutsche Telekom
AG’s (DTE)   T-Mobile USA (166783Q)  for allegedly infringing a patent for mobile
transactions.  On Track Innovations said T-Mobile infringed a patent that
lets mobile-phone users make payments, mine data and run other
applications, according to the complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in  Manhattan .  “We believe in the strength and value of our intellectual
property and have the resources to protect it,” Oded Bashan,
chief executive officer of Rosh Pina, Israel-based On Track
Innovations, said in a statement.  The complaint describes the patent, registered in April
2000, as “a data transaction card having contact and
contactless modes of operation.” On Track Innovations claims
that T-Mobile has been selling devices such as the HTC Amaze 4G
and Nokia Astound that employ the data transaction patent.  “T-Mobile does not provide comment on pending
litigation,” Anna Friedges, a spokeswoman for the Bellevue,
Washington-based company, said in an e-mail.  On Track Innovations rose 18 cents, or 12 percent, to $1.64
at 3:41 p.m. in  New York . The shares had risen 25 percent this
year before today.  The case is  On Track Innovations Ltd. (OTIV)  v. T-Mobile USA,
12-2224, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
