Greece ’s government plans to create
30 detention centers on the mainland to house illegal immigrants
before they are deported.  Each center will have space for about 1,000 people and
serve as a holding point before detainees who don’t qualify for
asylum are deported, according to a  statement  on the Ministry of
Citizen Protection’s website.  “We must show that we’re not giving false promises to
local communities and that we will solve the immigration
problem,” Citizen Protection Minister Michalis Chrisochoides
said yesterday after meeting with regional leaders, according to
the statement.  As many as 90 percent of illegal immigrants in the European
Union enter the bloc through Greece, according to  Greek police 
statistics. In 2011, about 100,000 people were arrested for
crossing the country’s borders illegally.  Chrisochoides said the centers will have adequate security
and create thousands of jobs in communities where they are
located. Greece may get 250 million euros ($333 million) from
the EU to help pay for the centers, said Chrisochoides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
