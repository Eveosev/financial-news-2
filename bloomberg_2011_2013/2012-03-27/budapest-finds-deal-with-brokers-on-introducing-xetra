The Budapest Stock Exchange has
found a compromise with  Hungary ’s biggest brokers on introducing
the Xetra trading platform in the second half of next year,
according to the bourse’s owner.  After “very intense talks” with all market participants
“we’ve agreed on a joint market model and on the system,”
Michael Buhl, who co-heads the CEE Stock Exchange Group, told
reporters in Vienna today, without elaborating.  The group, which also owns the Vienna, Ljubljana and Prague
bourses, has already introduced the trading platform in the
Austrian and Slovenian capitals and plans to roll it out to the
Czech exchange by the end of this year. Five of Hungary’s
biggest brokers have opposed the introduction Xetra, saying it
will erode the local Hungarian capital’s stock market.  Xetra “no longer is questioned,” Buhl said, adding that
formal decisions will be made at a board meeting of the Budapest
exchange and at the bourse’s annual general meeting at the end
of April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
