American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
posted the  biggest gain  in the 81-company Standard & Poor’s 500
Financials Index after  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  said the insurer may
repurchase $20 billion of stock in the next 12 months.  The bailed-out insurer jumped 2.1 percent to $29.67 at 4:08
p.m. in New York after advancing 2.8 percent yesterday.  Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche is repurchasing
stock from the government to help the company regain
independence from its 2008 rescue and improve return on equity.
New York-based AIG repurchased $3 billion of stock from the
Treasury Department on March 8 at $29 a share as the department
sold the same amount at that price in an  offering  to investors,
cutting the U.S.  stake  to about 70 percent.  “AIG is likely to buy back far more of its own shares than
the market price would indicate, and we believe those share
buybacks happen at a pace that is far faster than currently
anticipated,”  Joshua Shanker , an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said
in a note yesterday. “We believe $15-20 billion (or even more)
worth of buybacks over the next 12 months is achievable.”  Shanker said AIG may generate funds through distributions
from subsidiaries and additional  asset sales , including the
lowering of a stake in Hong Kong-based insurer  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  He
said he met last week with AIG managers including Chief
Financial Officer David Herzog.  The U.S. needs to average at least $28.72 on its share
sales to recoup taxpayer funds. Mark Herr, a spokesman for the
company, didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
