Kior Inc. (KIOR) , the Texas producer of
gasoline and diesel from wood, reached a six-week high after
saying construction on its first commercial plant is on schedule
and announcing that it’s changing the location for its second
facility.  Kior  rose  7.4 percent to $12.46 at the close in  New York ,
the highest since Feb. 9.  Kior’s first plant, in Columbus,  Mississippi , is 75 percent
complete and on track to begin production in the second half of
this year, Chief Executive Officer Fred Cannon said yesterday in
a conference call. The $222 million facility is on budget.  The company will build its second Mississippi plant in
Natchez instead of Newton, Cannon said. Kior switched locations
because of the new site’s proximity to railways and barges on
the  Mississippi River .  The production facility will be able to make as much as
120,000 gallons (455,000 liters) of fuel a day and is expected
to begin production in mid-2014, he said.  After the first plant is complete, Kior plans to raise more
capital, said Erica Mannion, a spokeswoman for the Pasadena,
Texas-based company. She didn’t say how much.  To contact the reporter on this story:
