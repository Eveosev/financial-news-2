The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24  raw materials  fell 0.1 percent to 704.24 at 3:43 p.m. in  New
York , led by grains.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI Index of 26  prices  declined 0.3
percent to 1,623.9.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat fell the most in two months after a government report
showed warm, wet weather boosted crop conditions from  Texas  to
 Illinois .  About 59 percent of the winter crop in  Kansas , the biggest
U.S. grower, was in good or excellent condition as of March 25,
up from 31 percent a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday. In Texas, 39 percent got the top
ratings, up from 11 percent.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures for May
delivery slumped 3 percent to $6.3975 a bushel, the biggest drop
for a most-active contract since Jan. 12.  Soybean futures for May delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
$13.6975 a bushel.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 1.1 percent to $6.3075 a
bushel.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for the first time in three sessions as
evidence that the  U.S. economy  is on firmer footing boosted the
dollar and weakened the case for additional economic stimulus
from the  Federal Reserve .  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for May delivery
retreated 0.2 percent to $3.88 a pound.  Copper for delivery in three months was unchanged at $8,535
a metric ton ($3.87 a pound) on the London Metal Exchange.  Lead and nickel declined in London. Aluminum, tin and zinc
rose.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures declined from a two-week high as the dollar’s
rebound eroded demand for the metal as an alternative
investment.  On the Comex, gold futures for June delivery fell 50 cents
to $1,687.70 an ounce.  Silver futures for May delivery slid 0.4 percent to $32.616
an ounce.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery slumped 0.9 percent to $663 an ounce. Platinum
futures for July delivery advanced 0.7 percent to $1,662.10 an
ounce, the third straight gain.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil climbed for the third straight session as reports
showed strength in the U.S. economy and on speculation the Fed
will keep stimulative monetary policies in place.  On the Nymex, oil futures for May delivery rose 0.3 percent
to $107.33 a barrel.  Brent oil for May settlement fell 0.1 percent to $125.54 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  North Sea  Forties blend was offered at a lower price even
after the Elgin field, which feeds into the benchmark crude
stream, was halted following a gas leak. Statoil ASA sold
Russian Urals in northwest  Europe  at a bigger discount to dated
Brent.  Total SA’s Elgin platform leaked gas for a third day in the
U.K. North Sea as neighboring rigs were evacuated to guard
against the risk of an explosion.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline fell on concern that a surge in retail prices will
reduce fuel demand and as crude oil retreated after an official
said the U.S. is considering a release of strategic petroleum
reserves.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for April delivery fell 0.3
percent to $3.4056 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for April delivery declined 0.3 percent
to $3.2186 a gallon.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas dropped to the lowest in more than a decade on
concern that a U.S. supply surplus will expand as the peak-
demand season for the heating fuel draws to an end.  On the Nymex, gas futures for April delivery slid 0.8
percent to $2.208 per million British thermal units. Earlier,
the price touched $2.176, the lowest since February 2002.  U.K. gas for next-month delivery advanced for the second
straight day as Total SA said it might take six months before a
leak at its North Sea Elgin platform is fixed.  Gas for April advanced 0.1 pence to 59.35 pence a therm at
4:25 p.m.  London  time. That’s equivalent to $9.48 per million
Btu. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle rose the most in two weeks on speculation that
export and domestic demand for U.S. beef is increasing.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for June
delivery rose 0.7 percent to $1.21975 a pound.  Hog futures for June settlement climbed 0.9 percent to
93.725 cents a pound, the biggest gain since Feb. 29.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement rose 0.9 percent
to $1.55075 a pound.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Arabica coffee rose the most in five months on concern that
adverse weather will hurt crops in Brazil and  Colombia , the
world’s largest producers.  On ICE Futures in New York, coffee for May delivery
advanced 4.8 percent to $1.8735 a pound, the biggest gain since
Oct. 21.  Cocoa futures for May delivery rose 1.1 percent to $2,356 a
