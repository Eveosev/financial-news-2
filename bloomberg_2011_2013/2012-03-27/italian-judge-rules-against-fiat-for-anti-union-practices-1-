A judge in Bologna,  Italy , ruled
against Fiat for anti-union behavior at its  Magneti Marelli (GIL) 
plants in the region in the first verdict concerning the Italian
carmaker’s new labor contract, according to a ruling posted on
the  Fiom Cgil union website .  “It’s a very important ruling as it’s the first one on the
new labor contract and ratifying our rights,” said Federico
Bellono, the union’s local head in Turin, by phone.  The company introduced a new contract for its Italian
workers beginning in January which includes longer shifts and
shorter breaks. Fiom Cgil, Fiat’s biggest union, contested the
labor deal and filed about 60 suits against the Italian company
for anti-union practices.  Fiom was excluded from being represented at the plants by
Fiat as it didn’t agree to sign the deal. The judge ordered Fiat
to halt anti-union behavior.  Fiat is “surprised and astonished” by the Bologna court
decision, it said in an e-mailed statement. The Italian carmaker
said it will “immediately appeal” the labor judge ruling. Fiat
reiterated that a Turin court already said its new labor
contract, which all its unions except Fiom signed last year, is
“legitimate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
