Former European Central Bank
Executive Board Member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said governments must
not take advantage of the efforts of central banks to calm
markets by easing off on improving budget discipline.  “There are still many issues that policy makers need to
tackle without having clear answers,” Bini Smaghi said today at
a conference in Cambridge, England. “One is the balance between
fiscal austerity and monetary policy.”  The ECB has injected more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3
trillion) into the banking system since December to boost
liquidity, a move that lowered funding costs and sovereign-bond
yields. President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday that euro-region
governments should continue to take “decisive measures” after
the liquidity provisions helped restore investor confidence.  “The more monetary policy does, the more it takes away
from the fiscal having to adjust,” Bini Smaghi said. “That’s a
complex issue that policy makers need to solve.”  He also said that  Europe ’s fiscal compact is “only one
aspect” of the solution to the region’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
