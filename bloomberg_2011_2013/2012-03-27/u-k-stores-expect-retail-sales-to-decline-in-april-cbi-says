U.K.  retail sales  were unchanged in
March from a year earlier and stores expect conditions to worsen
next month amid rising unemployment and higher energy prices,
the  Confederation of British Industry  said.  The gauge of annual sales growth rose to zero from minus 2
in February, the London-based business lobby said in a report
today. A measure of expected sales for April was at minus 4,
indicating retailers expect a decline.  “It is encouraging that sales on the high street are
stabilizing,” said Judith McKenna, chief operating officer of
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Asda unit and chair of the CBI’s
distributive trades panel. “However, the general retail outlook
remains tough” as the squeeze on consumers “continues to bite,
despite a recent fall in inflation, with wage growth modest and
fuel costs remaining high.”  Nationwide Building Society  said last week that  consumer
confidence  declined in February as rising joblessness and weak
economic growth made Britons more pessimistic about the future.
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said last week that
Britain will escape another recession, while reiterating his
plans to reduce the  budget deficit .  Within the monthly survey, the gauge of orders placed on
suppliers remained at minus 4 in March, while the volume of
stocks rose to 22 from 7 the previous month, the CBI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
