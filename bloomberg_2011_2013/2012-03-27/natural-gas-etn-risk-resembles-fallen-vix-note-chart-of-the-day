An exchange-traded note tied to
natural-gas prices is vulnerable to the kind of losses that
occurred last week in an ETN tracking U.S. stock volatility.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the percentage gap between
market prices and asset values for the notes. The natural-gas
ETN is part of  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s iPath series, and the other note
comes from Credit Suisse AG.  “Our advice is simply to stay away,”  Michael Shaoul ,
chief executive officer of Oscar Gruss & Son Inc. in  New York ,
wrote yesterday in an e-mail. He compared the iPath notes to
shares of a closed-end mutual fund, whose price can vary
substantially from the value of its holdings.  The iPath note, whose value stems from the total returns on
a Dow Jones-UBS index of natural gas, closed at premiums of more
than 100 percent to net asset value from March 5 to March 22.
The differential peaked last week at 134 percent.  Credit Suisse’s VelocityShares ETN reached an 89 percent
premium on March 21 before the firm ended a one-month suspension
on sales of new securities. The note plummeted 50 percent in the
next two days, shrinking the gap to 6.9 percent. It’s designed
to move twice as much each day as the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, or the VIX.  Barclays stopped issuing the natural-gas ETN in August
2009. Kristin Friel, a New York-based spokeswoman, declined to
comment on whether sales may resume.  To contact the reporter on this story:
