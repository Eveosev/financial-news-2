Treasury investors in a weekly
survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced expectations that prices
of Treasuries would rise, increasing so-called neutral positions
to the highest level since Feb. 21.  The percent of “net longs” dropped to 4 percent in the
week ended yesterday, from 10 percent last week, while the
number of outright neutrals in the firm’s “all clients” survey
rose to 66 percent, JPMorgan wrote in a report today.  The level of outright shorts was unchanged at 15 percent,
while the survey showed the level of outright longs dropped to
19 percent from 25 percent. A long position is a bet the price
of a security will rise, while a short position is a wager the
price of a security will drop.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note touched 2.4 percent
on March 20, the highest since October. After dropping to a
record low of 1.67 percent in September, the yield traded as low
as 1.79 percent this year.  The 10-year yield dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.23 percent at 8:55 a.m. in  New York .  JPMorgan doesn’t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York,
wasn’t immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
