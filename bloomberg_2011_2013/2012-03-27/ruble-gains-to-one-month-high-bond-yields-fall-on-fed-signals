The ruble weakened against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket for the first time in
three sessions and  Russia ’s local-currency bonds fell as oil,
the country’s chief export earner, declined in  New York .  The Russian currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 33.3765
against the basket at the close in Moscow, paring yesterday’s 1
percent advance. The yield on Russia’s 114 billion rubles ($3.9
billion) of domestic OFZ bonds due 2021 rose two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.84 percent.  Crude futures dropped 0.4 percent to $106.59 per barrel in
New York on reports the U.S. is considering a release from its
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Oil and gas together provide about
17 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product and 50 percent of
state revenue, according to government estimates.  The ruble was 0.2 percent weaker at 38.6948 per euro and
little changed at 29.0252 per dollar. Investors increased bets
on the currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing
it at 29.399 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 29.368 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
