Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  and  China
Southern (1055)  Airlines Co. both had Airbus SAS A380s turn back mid-
flight today because of faults. The two aircraft landed safely.  The Singapore Air plane turned around about three hours
into a flight to Frankfurt after pilots shut down one of the
four engines, according to an e-mail from the carrier.  China 
Southern’s jet returned to Beijing because of a cabin-pressure
“problem,” it said on Weibo, a Chinese service similar to
Twitter. The Guangzhou-based carrier didn’t elaborate.  Singapore Air is consulting with engine-maker  Rolls-Royce
Holdings Plc (RR/)  after the No. 3 powerplant on the A380 suffered a
disruption in its airflow. The plane, carrying more than 430
passengers, landed at 6:40 a.m. in Singapore. The customers were
later put on another aircraft for the Frankfurt flight.  “The safety of our customers and crew was not compromised
at any time,” the Singapore-based airline said. “The aircraft
is capable of flying safely on three engines.”  China Southern’s A380 was carrying 418 passengers on a
flight to Guangzhou, southern China. The plane landed in Beijing
at 11:18 a.m., according to the airport’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
