Japanese  stock   futures  fell as 78
percent of companies listed in the nation’s Topix index prepare
to go ex-dividend today and after U.S. data on  consumer
confidence  and property values failed to encourage investors.
Australian equities were little changed.  American depositary receipts of  Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest bank by market value, fell 4 percent
from the closing share prices in Tokyo. ADRs of  Sharp Corp. (6753) , a
Japanese electronics maker, jumped 15 percent as it gets a 133
billion yen ($1.6 billion) investment from Foxconn Technology
Group and founder Terry Gou.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , an
Australian building-materials supplier that gets almost 70
percent of sales from the U.S., rose 0.5 percent in Sydney.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 10,130 in Chicago yesterday, down from 10,180 in
Osaka,  Japan . They were bid in the pre-market at 10,140 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was
little changed in Sydney today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
gained less than 0.1 percent in Wellington.  “In terms of reassessing the outlook over the next quarter
or so, people will probably sit on the sidelines,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana
Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “The Asian region is probably going
to need its own catalyst because U.S. data overnight were mixed,
and as a result we are in a consolidation phase after markets
put on some pretty gains, particularly in Japan.”  Ex-Dividend  Mizuho Financial is among 1,307 of the 1,666 companies
listed in the Topix index that are set to go ex-dividend today,
meaning investors who buy their shares today can no longer get
dividends for the fiscal year ending this week.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  yesterday erased losses
since the country’s record earthquake as the declining yen and
$241 billion of reconstruction spending helped make it the best-
performing benchmark index in the developed world this year.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index dropped 0.3 percent in New York
yesterday after the Conference Board’s confidence index dropped
to 70.2 from a revised 71.6 reading in February. The S&P/Case-
Shiller index of property values in 20 cities fell 3.8 percent
from a year earlier, after decreasing 4.1 percent in December.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  added 12 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 12 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 9.2 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 15 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500
and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  Solar stocks led a decline in Chinese shares traded in New
York on speculation that Italy will follow Germany in cutting
subsidies to the industry, dimming the outlook for global
installations. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-
traded Chinese shares in the U.S. lost 0.3 percent to 105.42
yesterday, falling for the first time in three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
