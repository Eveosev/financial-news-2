Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  of Austria and
 Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG)  led Czech shares higher, snapping the
main index’s five-day slump before a report that may show the
U.S. real-estate market is stabilizing.  Erste increased 1.4 percent to 457 koruna by 10:09 a.m. in
Prague after sliding 2.9 percent in the previous five sessions.
The stock was up 32 percent so far this year. The 14-member  PX (PX) 
gauge, where Erste has a 19 percent weighting, rose 0.9 percent
to 996, extending its 2012 rally to 9 percent.  European stocks gained, set for the biggest first-quarter
rally since 1998, as  house prices  in 20 U.S. cities probably
fell at a slower pace in the year to January, according to
economists’ estimates. Banks were among the best performers
after the U.K. government held talks with investors to sell a
part of its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
