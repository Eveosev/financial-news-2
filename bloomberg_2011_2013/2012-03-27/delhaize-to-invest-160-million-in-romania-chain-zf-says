Louis Delhaize SA, the Belgian
retailer which owns the Cora hypermarket chain, plans to invest
120 million euros ($160 million) in  Romania  this year, Ziarul
Financiar reported today, citing Philippe Lejeune, who heads
Cora Romania.  Cora plans to invest half of the money in new stores, as it
seeks to open three stores this year to reach 11 units in the
eastern European country, and half to buy land for its medium-
and long-term expansion, Lejeune was quoted saying by the
Bucharest-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
