U.S. stocks retreated as a report
showing American  consumer confidence  near the strongest level in
a year failed to encourage investors after the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index advanced to an almost four-year high.  Losses accelerated in the final 15 minutes of trading as
financial companies slumped.  Bank of America Corp.  lost 3.3
percent as  Robert W. Baird  & Co. cut its rating.  Apollo Group
Inc. (APOL)  fell 8.5 percent on new enrollment concern. Homebuilder
 Lennar Corp. (LEN)  surged 4.7 percent amid better-than-estimated
earnings.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  added 1.5 percent as Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. raised the possibility of a full  breakup  of the company.  The S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent to 1,412.52 at 4 p.m. New York
time, after rising 1.7 percent in two days. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  slid 43.90 points, or 0.3 percent, to
13,197.73. About  6.1 billion  shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanged today, or 8.8 percent below the three-month average.  “There’s maybe some short-term vulnerability, but it
doesn’t really dent my longer-term optimism,” said Liz Ann Sonders, the New York-based chief investment strategist at
Charles Schwab Corp. Her firm has $1.81 trillion in client
assets. “We had a huge day yesterday. So, it’s not a big
surprise not to see an immediate follow-through.”  The S&P 500 yesterday erased last week’s loss. The index
rose 3.4 percent in March, poised for a fourth straight monthly
gain, the longest winning streak since 2009. It trades for  14.6
times (SPX)  reported earnings, the highest valuation level since July
while below the average since 1954 of 16.4.  Economic Data  The Conference Board’s confidence index dropped to 70.2
from a revised 71.6 reading in February that was higher than
initially reported. The median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for a decrease to 70. The S&P/Case-
Shiller index of property values in 20 cities fell 3.8 percent
from a year earlier, after decreasing 4.1 percent in December.  “The trend of economic data has been improving and that’s
helped provide a better backdrop for investors to feel
comfortable putting money into stocks,” Michael Sheldon, chief
market strategist at RDM Financial Group in Westport,
 Connecticut , which oversees $650 million, said in a telephone
interview. “Yet we really haven’t seen much in terms of profit
taking. It could be choppy.”  Seven out of 10 groups in the  S&P 500  fell. Financial
shares had the biggest decline among 10 industries, dropping 1
percent.  Bank of America  dropped 3.3 percent to $9.60 after
being downgraded to neutral at Robert W. Baird. The 12-month
share-price estimate is $10.  ‘Volatile’  Apollo Group slumped 8.5 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $39.54. Co-Chief Executive Officer Gregory Cappelli told
investors on a conference call that new enrollments will
continue to be “volatile.” Credit Suisse Group AG cut its
recommendation for the shares to neutral.  A measure of homebuilders in S&P indexes gained 2.9
percent. Lennar rallied 4.7 percent to $27.63. Net income for
the three months ended Feb. 29 fell to $15 million, or 8 cents a
share, from $27.4 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier. Lennar
was expected to earn about  5 cents  a share, the average estimate
of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Pfizer climbed 1.5 percent, the most in the Dow, to $22.50.
The  shares  have increased 8.3 percent since July 6, the day
before Pfizer Chief Executive Officer  Ian Read  said the New
York-based company was exploring strategic alternatives for its
animal health and nutrition businesses.  Read, at a recent meeting with Goldman analysts, indicated
he may be willing to further split up the company after selling
or spinning off those two units,  Jami Rubin , a Goldman Sachs
analyst, wrote in a note to investors.  $20 Billion  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  advanced 2.1 percent to
$29.67 after Deutsche Bank AG said the insurer may repurchase
$20 billion of stock in the next 12 months.  Walgreen Co. (WAG)  added 1.3 percent to $34.80. The largest U.S.
drugstore chain reported second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates after new grocery and household items
boosted sales.  Opnext Inc. (OPXT)  surged 53 percent, the most in the Russell 2000
Index, to $1.73. The maker of optical components for
communications networks will be purchased by Oclaro Inc. in an
all-stock deal. Holders of Fremont, California-based Opnext will
get 0.42 shares of Oclaro stock, or about $1.96, for every
Opnext share they own.  JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU)  gained 3.3 percent to $14.79 and  Finisar
Corp. (FNSR)  advanced 3.8 percent to $20.14 after Jefferies & Co. said
they may gain market share while Opnext and Oclaro integrate
their businesses.  Best Since 1998  The S&P 500 has climbed 12 percent since the end of last
year, poised for the best first quarter since 1998, amid better-
than-forecast earnings and economic data. Financial companies
and computer makers rose the most among 10 groups, surging at
least 21 percent so far in 2012.  Peter Lee, the New York-based chief technical analyst for
UBS AG, said fund managers’ purchases of the  best-performing 
stocks at the end of the quarter are likely to push the S&P 500
toward his 2012 target range of 1,440 to 1,450 sooner than the
second half of the year, as he had anticipated.  The S&P 500 would need to rise 1.7 percent to reach 1,440
from yesterday’s closing level of 1,416.51. A failure of the
benchmark index to hold gains above these levels may trigger a
pullback of 5 percent to 10 percent, he said.  “When the quarter has been extremely strong, these
institutional investors are pressured or motivated to dress up
their portfolios to show clients that they actively participated
in the marketplace during the quarter,” Lee wrote in a note
yesterday. “The focus on momentum stocks and sectors leaves the
overall market vulnerable for a correction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
