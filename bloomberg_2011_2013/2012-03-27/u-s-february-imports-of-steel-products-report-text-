Following is the text of the U.S.
steel report from the Commerce Department:  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that preliminary February
steel imports were $1.8 billion (1.6 million metric tons).  This
was a decrease of $0.3 billion (0.2 million metric tons) from
the preliminary January totals of $2.1 billion (1.9 million
metric tons).  The February change in steel imports based on metric
tonnage reflected decreases primarily in hot rolled sheets and
oil country goods.  Decreases occurred primarily with  Mexico .  The year to date final statistics through January 2011
showed steel imports of 1.9 million metric tons compared with
1.5 million metric tons through January 2010. The largest
commodity increase occurred primarily in oil country goods and
the largest commodity decrease occurred primarily in line pipe
greater than 16 inches.  The largest country increases occurred
primarily with Mexico and  Brazil .  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department      http://www.bea.gov   To contact the reporter on this story:
