Gasoline fell on concern that a
surge in retail prices will reduce fuel demand and as crude oil
retreated after an official said the U.S. is considering a
release of strategic petroleum reserves.  Futures declined as  regular gasoline  at the pump has surged
19 percent this year and is 8.7 cents below 2011’s peak of
$3.985 on May 4, according to AAA, the nation’s biggest motoring
group. Charles McConnell, the Energy Department’s acting
assistant secretary of fossil fuels, said the U.S. is weighing a
release in response to potential supply restrictions.  “Gasoline has had such an incredible run but now there’s
some concern that high prices are going to hurt demand,” said
 Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Gasoline for April delivery fell 1.1 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to settle at $3.4056 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the first loss in three days. The more actively traded
May contract fell 1.23 cents to $3.3864 a gallon.  Gasoline has surged 27 percent this year, making it the
best performer in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24
commodities.  Prices also declined on speculation that ConocoPhillips
restarted a fluid catalytic cracker at its 238,000-barrel-a-day
Bayway refinery in Linden,  New Jersey , after an upset yesterday.
The plant is located along New York Harbor, the delivery point
for Nymex gasoline contracts.  “The Bayway cat cracker outage was only for a day and not
an extended period of time,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Idled Refineries  Along the U.S. East Coast,  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  and ConocoPhillips
last year idled money-losing refineries in  Pennsylvania  with a
combined capacity of 363,000 barrels a day, or 24 percent of the
region’s capacity, according to the Energy Department. Sunoco
has said it will shut its 335,000-barrel-a-day Philadelphia
refinery by July unless it can attract a buyer.  Retail demand this year through March 23 was 5.6 percent
below the same period in 2011, according to MasterCard Inc.’s
SpendingPulse report today. That’s the biggest decline for this
time of the year in SpendingPulse records, dating back to 2004.
Demand has been below year-earlier levels for 30 consecutive
weeks and the four-week average has fallen a record 53 weeks.  “We don’t have any material improvements in gasoline
demand and it may have crested at a 10-month high,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Unless demand improves, it will have
trouble charting at higher levels.”  Gasoline inventories probably dropped a sixth consecutive
time last week, losing 1.55 million barrels to an 11-week low,
according to the median estimate of 12 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg News. Distillate supplies fell 500,000 barrels,
according to the survey.  Heating oil for April delivery declined 1.02 cents, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $3.2186 a gallon on the Nymex. Prices have
gained 9.7 percent this year. The May contract slipped 1.05
cents to $3.236.  To contact the reporter on this story:
