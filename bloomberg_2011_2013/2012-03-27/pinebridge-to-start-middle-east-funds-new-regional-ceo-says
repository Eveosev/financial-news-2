PineBridge Investments LLC, a New
York-based money manager, plans to introduce new funds in the
 Middle East  and North Africa, said Talal Al Zain, whose
appointment as head of a new regional headquarters for the
company was announced today.  PineBridge, which manages $67.3 billion in assets, will
focus on industries where demand is strong, such as health care,
education and industrial companies that need growth capital, Al
Zain said in a telephone interview. He said PineBridge is
looking at a couple of opportunities, without giving details of
those or of the funds it plans to set up.  The region “has substantial wealth, and as the markets
develop there are excellent opportunities on the investment
side,” he said. “The Gulf region itself is very critical for
us because of the huge wealth.”  PineBridge currently has offices in Dubai and  Turkey 
employing fewer than nine people, Al Zain said. He said that
about 35 jobs will be added in the region within a year. The
company is considering locations including Bahrain for its
headquarters, he said.  Al Zain is the former chief executive officer of the
Bahraini sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat Holding Co. PineBridge
is owned by Hong Kong-based  Pacific Century Group (PCGZ) , according to
the  company’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
