PT Hero Supermarket (ETWA) ,  Indonesia ’s
third-largest general retailer by market value, surged the most
in at least 20 years after it agreed with Inter Ikea Systems BV
to open and operate Ikea stores.  Hero gained 20 percent to close at 23,250 rupiah, the
highest close since at least Feb. 17, 1992. The Jakarta
Composite index gained 1.2 percent.  Hero said in a statement yesterday it signed a franchise
agreement to open and operate Ikea stores starting 2014 until
2021, with an option to add more stores after the term ended.  Companies like Hero and Ikea, the world’s biggest furniture
retailer controlled by Ingvar Kamprad, Europe’s richest man, may
benefit from an economy that grew last year at the  fastest pace 
since before the Asian financial crisis as rising investment and
domestic spending countered a slowdown in export demand due to
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  Indonesia’s growth in 2011 was the fastest since 1996,
according to International Monetary Fund data. The $707 billion
economy has expanded more than 6 percent for five straight
quarters, showing it’s weathering a decline in global demand
that has hurt growth across  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
