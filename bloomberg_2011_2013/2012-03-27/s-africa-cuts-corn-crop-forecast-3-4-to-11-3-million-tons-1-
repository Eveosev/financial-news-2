(Corrects to show last year’s harvest was smaller in
second paragraph.)    South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, reduced its forecast for production
of the grain this year by 3.4 percent because of a lack of rain
in growing regions, according to the Crop Estimates Committee.  The nation may reap 11.3 million metric tons of corn this
season, Baldwin Netshifhefhe, the committee’s principal
statistician, said by phone from  Pretoria  today. South Africa
produced 10.4 million tons of corn last year.  The forecast includes 6.5 million tons of white corn and
4.8 million tons of yellow, he said. The total forecast compares
with last month’s estimate of 11.7 million tons and is below the
11.4 million-ton median estimate by eight traders surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  “Expected production was lowered because of a mid-season
dry spell in in February, which affected crop yields,”
Netshifhefhe said.  Prices for white corn, the nation’s staple food, have risen
43 percent over the past year on the South African Futures
Exchange. The grain for July delivery closed at 2,305 rand
($304) a ton today and reached an intraday record of 2,340 rand
yesterday. Yellow corn for July delivery closed at 2,203 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
