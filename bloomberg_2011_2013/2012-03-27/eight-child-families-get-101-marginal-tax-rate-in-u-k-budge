Britain’s budget means parents face
marginal tax rates that vary depending on how many children they
have -- and those with eight or more will pay more in tax than
they earn on part of their income.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s March 21
statement announced revised details of his pledge to remove
child-benefit payments, which currently go to all parents, from
the wealthiest as part of his plans to tackle the  budget
deficit . The withdrawal will be tapered between incomes of
50,000 pounds ($79,000) and 60,000 pounds a year, so that a
parent earning 60,000 pounds will lose the benefit altogether.  A new  income-tax charge  will be used to claw back the
payments. This will add 11 percentage points to the marginal tax
rate of families with one child and 18 points to those with two,
according to the  Institute for Fiscal Studies . A household with
eight children will have to pay back as much as 5,933 pounds,
pushing up its marginal  tax rate  to 101 percent from the current
42 percent.  “It’s an unusual way of implementing the taper,” said
Robert Joyce, research economist at the London-based  institute. 
“But it is at least an improvement on the very high marginal
rate lower down the income scale that they would have had under
the previous plan.”  Under Osborne’s original proposal, any parent earning
enough to pay tax at the 40 percent rate -- currently just over
42,000 pounds a year -- would have lost all of the benefit,
which is worth 1,056 pounds a year for the first child and 697
pounds for each subsequent one. The change is due to take effect
in January 2013.  Still, the new arrangements do not get rid of the anomaly
whereby a family with two parents each earning less than 50,000
pounds will keep the benefit, while a neighboring household with
a single income of 50,000 pounds or more will lose it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
