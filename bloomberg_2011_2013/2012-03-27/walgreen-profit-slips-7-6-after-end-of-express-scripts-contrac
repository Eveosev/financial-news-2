Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S.
drugstore chain, reported second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates after new grocery and household items
boosted sales.  Net income in the quarter ended Feb. 29 declined 7.6
percent to $683 million, or 78 cents a share, from $739 million,
or 80 cents, a year earlier, Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen
said today in a statement. Analysts projected 77 cents, the
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Greg Wasson increased general
merchandise sales in stores open at least a year by 2.1 percent
after introducing food and packaged-goods products to attract
budget-conscious shoppers. The demand helped widen the company’s
gross margin, which analysts had expected to narrow after the
Dec. 31 expiration of a contract to provide  Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) 
customers with  prescription drugs .  The stronger gross margin “was driven by convenience/fresh
food, household and personal care categories,” Deborah Weinswig, a New York-based analyst at Citigroup Inc., wrote
today in a note to clients. She recommends selling Walgreen
shares.  Walgreen’s  gross margin , or gross profit as a percentage of
sales, widened to 28.9 percent from 28.8 percent. Analysts had
projected the measure would narrow to 28.7 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Total net sales rose 0.8 percent to $18.7 billion. The
average estimate of 10 analysts was $18.6 billion.  Walgreen rose 1.4 percent to $34.86 at 10:34 a.m. in  New
York . The  shares  gained 4 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
