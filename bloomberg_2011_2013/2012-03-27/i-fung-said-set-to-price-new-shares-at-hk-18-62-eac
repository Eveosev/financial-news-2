Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the world’s largest
supplier of clothes and toys to retailers, is set to price the
shares in its secondary offering at HK$18.62 each, said two
people with knowledge of the matter.  The people declined to be identified because the details
are private. Hong Kong-based Li & Fung was planning to raise
about $500 million selling shares at HK$18.52 to HK$18.82
apiece, according to terms for the transaction obtained by
Bloomberg News. Li & Fung planned to use the money for “future
business development and acquisitions,” according to the
document.  Li & Fung is raising money after reporting a 24
percent increase in 2011 profit last week and saying it may make
more deals. The company increased earnings by acquiring rivals
and entering into supply agreements to sell American and
European retailers consumer goods that are mostly made in Asian
countries, such as China and  Thailand .  A message left at the company’s New York office wasn’t
immediately returned. The stock closed at HK$19.60 yesterday in
Hong Kong trading.  The company sees acquisition opportunities in areas such as
beauty and health care, Deputy Chairman  William Fung  said in an
interview last week.  “When things are not looking good in the world in general,
it’s probably good for opportunities,” Fung said at the time.
“Our primary focus would be the markets we sell to, the U.S.
and  Europe . Europe is not looking very good, there may be
opportunities.”  Li & Fung surged on March 23 after the earnings report and
the stock is now up 36 percent for the year compared
with 14 percent for the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (11)   To contact the reporter on this story:
