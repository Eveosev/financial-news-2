Georgian President Mikheil
Saakashvili’s party would win parliamentary elections if they
were held tomorrow, beating billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s
opposition coalition, a poll showed.  As many as 47 percent of likely voters would back
Saakashvili’s National Movement, according to a survey by the
National Democratic Institute, Akaki Minashvili, a lawmaker from
the ruling party, said today by phone from the capital, Tbilisi.
The results have only been given to political parties.  The poll, funded since 2008 by the Swedish International
Development Agency, showed Ivanishvili’s party had 10 percent
backing before October’s parliamentary vote. The nationwide
survey of 3,161 people was conducted in February and March and
has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.  Opposition politicians, including former United Nations
envoy Irakli Alasania, have accused Saakashvili of rolling back
democratic freedoms. Still, 29 percent of Georgians would vote
for a representative from his party at the next presidential
elections, Minashvili said, citing the poll. Ivanishvili is
seeking to restore his Georgian citizenship to challenge the
president, whose second and final term ends next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
