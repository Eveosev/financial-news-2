Fomento de Construcciones y
Contratas SA , a Spanish construction company, got its lenders to
agree to extend the lifetime of 438 million euros ($585 million)
of debt, according to a banker involved in the transaction.  The facility will take the form of a term loan maturing in
April 2015 and replace a  credit line  that expires next month,
the banker said. Twelve banks are taking part in the so-called
forward start agreement, a type of deal that allows companies to
push back the maturity of a loan before it comes due in exchange
for higher fees and interest.  Barcelona-based  FCC (FCC)  will pay a margin of 375 basis points
more than the euro interbank offered rate for the new loan, the
banker said. A spokesman for FCC, who declined to be identified
citing company policy, wouldn’t comment.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA,
CaixaBank SA and Bankia SA arranged the deal, FCC said in a
statement.  FCC  rose  as much as 2.2 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since March 14, and gained 1.7 percent to 17.42 euros at 1:51
p.m. in Madrid trading. The stock has lost 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
