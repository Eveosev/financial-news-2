England  was 57-3 at lunch on day
two of the series-opening cricket Test in Galle in reply to Sri
Lanka’s 318 all out.  Spin bowler Rangana Herath took 2-17 as top-ranked England
lost Alastair Cook, Jonathan Trott and Andrew Strauss after Sri
Lanka added 29 runs to its overnight total of 289-8.  Kevin
Pietersen  was 3 not out at the interval, with Ian Bell on 13.  Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene made 180 before James
Anderson had him caught behind by wicketkeeper Matt Prior to end
the home team’s innings. Anderson finished as England’s best
bowler with 5-72.  The teams are scheduled to play two Tests. England is
seeking to rebound from a 3-0 sweep of losses against  Pakistan 
in the United Arab Emirates in January and February, while Sri
Lanka is without a Test series win since August 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
