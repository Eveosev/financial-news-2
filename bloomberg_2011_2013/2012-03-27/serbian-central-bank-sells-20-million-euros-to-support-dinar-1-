Serbia â€™s central bank sold euros
today, adding liquidity in to market trading as dinar dropped to
as low as 111.5630 to the euro.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said it sold 20
million euros ($26.69 million), a day after announcing plans to
amend reserve requirement rules to release additional foreign-
currency liquidity to create demand for the weakening dinar. The
National Bank of Serbia has sold 385.5 million euros since the
start of 2012 to prop up the dinar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
