Ulker Biskuvi Sanayi AS (ULKER) ,  Turkey ’s
largest sweets maker, rose to the highest in almost a month
after reporting 2011 profit that beat estimates.  Ulker gained 1.8 percent to 5.56 liras, its strongest since
Feb. 28, by the close in Istanbul.  Full-year profit was 657 million liras ($368 million), the
company said in a statement to the exchange after the close
yesterday, beating the 606 million-lira average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of nine analysts.  Ulker’s profit was more than triple the 184.8 million liras
the company earned in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
