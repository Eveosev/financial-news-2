Ukraine’s budget surplus widened in
the first two months of the year as revenue increased more than
spending, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The surplus was 4.7 billion hryvnia ($585.4 million),
compared with 4.13 billion hryvnia in January and February last
year, the ministry, based in the capital, Kiev, said today in a
statement on its  website . Revenue increased 15.9 percent to 51.8
billion hryvnia, driven by corporate tax, while spending rose
15.7 percent to 46.848 billion hryvnia, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
