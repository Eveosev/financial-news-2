Lennar Corp. (LEN) , the third-largest
U.S. homebuilder by revenue, rose to its highest since September
2007 after reporting net income that beat estimates and a 33
percent increase in new home orders.  Net income for the three months ended Feb. 29 fell to $15
million, or 8 cents a share, from $27.4 million, or 14 cents, a
year earlier, when the company booked a $37.5 million legal
settlement, the Miami-based company said today in a statement.
Lennar was expected to earn about 5 cents a share, the average
estimate of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The company “turned in results that met, or exceeded, our
expectations on nearly every metric,” Stephen East, an analyst
with International Strategy & Investment Group LLC in St.
Charles,  Missouri , wrote in a note today. “We cannot emphasize
enough that the Street’s expectations had grown sharply in the
last week or so, yet the results surpassed those as well.”  Lennar climbed 4.7 percent to $27.63 today in New York, its
highest close since Sept. 5, 2007. It was the day’s biggest
gainer in the 11-member Standard & Poor’s 1500 Homebuilding
 Index (S15HOME) , which rose 2.9 percent. Builders  Ryland Group Inc. (RYL)  and
 Standard Pacific Corp. (SPF)  also increased more than 4 percent today.  Buyers’ ‘Moment’  Purchases of new homes have begun to rebound from a record
low in 2011 as the  unemployment rate  falls and  consumer
confidence  increases.  New houses  sold at an annual pace of
313,000 last month, the Commerce Department reported March 23,
up 11 percent from February 2011 while down 1.6 percent from
January and lower than economists’ estimates.  Buyers “are starting to feel pressure not to miss this
moment,” Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Miller  said today
during a conference call with analysts. “The fully-loaded cost
of ownership is lower in the most-desirable markets than
comparable rental rates.”  Lennar’s total revenue for the quarter climbed to $724.9
million from $558 million a year earlier. Analysts expected a
figure of about $700 million.  Orders increased to 3,022 homes, up from 2,267 a year
earlier. The backlog of homes under construction, another
indicator of future revenue, rose to 2,711, a 39 percent
increase from a year earlier. The average price of a home
delivered rose to $246,000 for the quarter, up 3 percent from a
year earlier.  Price Increases  “The company highlighted its ability to convert rising
sales-per-community into price increases and reduced
incentives,” Stephen Kim, an analyst with Barclays Capital Inc.
in  New York , wrote in a note today.  Lennar, which has reported a profit in every period since
the second quarter of 2010, trades distressed real estate and
notes through its Rialto Investments unit to supplement its
homebuilding revenue.  The company spent $212 million to buy 4,225 home sites
during the quarter and $61 million to develop land for
construction, up a combined 34 percent from a year earlier.
About 39 percent of the purchased land was in  Florida , 22
percent in  Texas  and 14 percent in the Pacific Northwest, with
the balance spread around the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
