Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd. (493) ’s 2011 profit fell 6 percent, missing analyst estimates as
higher costs weighed on  China ’s  second-biggest  electronics
retailer.  Net income  dropped to 1.84 billion yuan ($292 million) last
year, compared with 1.96 billion yuan a year earlier, Beijing-
based Gome said in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange
today. The mean  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was 2.42 billion yuan.  Gome is expanding to challenge larger rival Suning
Appliance Co. in China, where  retail sales  expanded 15 percent
in the first two months in 2012, slowing from an 18 percent
increase in December. The board didn’t recommend the payment of
a final dividend to preserve capital, Gome said today.  “We are still at an early stage in developing our e-
commerce business,” said Fang Wei, Gome’s chief financial
officer, at a press conference today. “We’ll continue to invest
quite substantially into the project. The initial investment may
drag down our margins in the short term.”  Gome opened 282 new stores and closed 29 underperforming
outlets last year, according to the statement. Network expansion
and development of e-commerce pushed up selling and distribution
costs, the company said. Sales at stores open at least a year
rose 3.1 percent. The company plans to add 250 to 260 stores
this year, Fang said.  The retailer, 9.9 percent owned by U.S. private equity fund
Bain Capital LLC, said sales grew 17.5 percent to 59.8 billion
yuan and the cost of sales surged to 52 billion yuan from 45
billion yuan. Gome’s inventories amounted to about 9.6 billion
yuan at the end of 2011, up 19 from a year earlier.  Suning earned 4.82 billion yuan last year on revenue of
93.9 billion yuan, according to a preliminary earnings statement
to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.  Industry sales may pick up if the government restores
subsidies to consumers for the purchase of home appliances after
an earlier program giving shoppers as much as 400 yuan ended
Dec. 31.  Gome climbed 3 percent to HK$2.08 in  Hong Kong  before the
earnings announcement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
