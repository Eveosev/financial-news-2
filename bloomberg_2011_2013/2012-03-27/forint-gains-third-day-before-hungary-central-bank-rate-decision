Hungary’s government bonds
strengthened, sending yields to a six-day low, after the central
bank kept the European Union’s highest benchmark interest rate
unchanged today.  Gains in the benchmark three-year notes cut yields four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage points, to 8.57 percent, the
lowest since March 21. The forint was 0.2 percent weaker at
292.11 against the euro at 2:37 p.m. in Budapest. The Magyar
Nemzeti Bank left its two-week deposit rate at 7 percent for a
third month, matching the forecast from all 26 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Central bank President Andras Simor
will explain the decision at 3 p.m. in Budapest.  “The forint might benefit today should central bank
President Andras Simor acknowledge the rising inflation risks,”
Carolin Hecht, a Frankfurt-based strategist at Commerzbank AG,
wrote in a research report.  Consumer prices in February rose 5.9 percent from a year
earlier, the fastest pace in the EU, driven by fuel and
household energy costs, data published on March 13 showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
