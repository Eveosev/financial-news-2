Gianni Versace SpA (GIAN)  forecast revenue
growth of at least 10 percent in each of the next three years
after “fantastic” U.S. demand helped the Italian fashion house
swing to a profit in 2011.  Net income was 8.5 million euros ($11.4 million) last year
compared with a loss of 21.7 million euros in 2010, the Milan-
based company said today in a statement. Revenue climbed 16
percent to 340.2 million euros.  “Looking ahead we are cautiously optimistic for 2012,”
Chief Executive Officer Gian Giacomo Ferraris said in the
statement. “The Versace brand has great potential for growth in
existing as well as new markets, even if expansion slows in the
global market for  luxury goods .”  Versace echoes  Hermes International SCA (RMS)  and other luxury
companies in predicting sustained demand for their products amid
slowing economic growth in China and Europe’s debt crisis. Sales
of high-end goods should rise 10 percent in 2012, half last
year’s rate, as European shoppers cut spending by a mid-single-
digit percentage, according to HSBC analyst  Antoine Belge .  “America is doing fantastic,” Ferraris said this month in
an interview at the Baselworld watch fair. Globally, year-to-
date sales “confirm the double-digit growth we gave in 2011. We
are confident that we can repeat the fantastic 2011.”  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization advanced 73 percent to 38.7 million euros, Versace
said today. The fashion house, recognizable by its Medusa-head
logo, is aiming for sales of about 500 million euros and an
Ebitda margin of 20 percent by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
