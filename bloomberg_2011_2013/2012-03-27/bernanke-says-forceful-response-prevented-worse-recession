Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank’s aggressive response to the
2007-2009 financial crisis and recession helped prevent a
worldwide catastrophe.  “We did stop the meltdown,” Bernanke said today in the
third of four lectures to undergraduates at George Washington
University. “We avoided what would have been, I think, a
collapse of the global financial system.”  The lectures are the latest effort by the Fed to explain
its actions to the public as it comes under scrutiny by critics
in Congress and on the campaign trail. Representative  Ron Paul ,
a Texas Republican who is seeking his party’s presidential
nomination, today criticized the Fed for its aid to the  European
Central Bank .  Today’s talk in Washington focused on the Fed’s response to
the crisis. In the previous one, Bernanke examined its roots,
including the boom and bust in  home prices  and the Fed’s failure
to recognize vulnerabilities in the financial system.  Following the bankruptcy of  Lehman Brothers  Holdings Inc.
in 2008, the central bank flooded the financial system with
liquidity, expanding its balance  sheet  to $2.3 trillion by
December of that year from $900 billion in September.  Recession Deepens  Even as the crisis ebbed, the recession deepened, with
gross domestic product shrinking at an 8.9 percent annual rate
in the fourth quarter of 2008, the worst quarter in 50 years.
The  unemployment rate  rose to 10 percent in October 2009, the
highest since June 1983.  The threat of a second Great Depression “was very real,”
Bernanke told the class.  The financial system came under pressure in the summer of
2007 as the market for subprime mortgage bonds began to
collapse, and by August the Fed responded by cutting the
 interest rate  it charges on loans to banks borrowing at its
discount window.  The Fed lowered its benchmark interest  rate  in a series of
cuts, to 3 percent in January 2008 from 5.25 percent in August
2007. Yet in March 2008, the crisis intensified with the
collapse of Bear Stearns Cos., the fifth-biggest U.S. securities
firm, prompting the Fed to intervene and help JPMorgan Chase &
Co. acquire the bank.  Lehman Brothers Fails  That didn’t end the crisis. In September 2008, Lehman
Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history after the
central bank and  U.S. Treasury  declined to intervene. One day
later, the Fed made an $85 billion loan to  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)  to avert the collapse of the New York-
based insurance company.  Bernanke defended the central bank’s bailout of AIG. Its
failure “would have had a massive effect on other financial
firms and markets,” Bernanke said.  “The rescue of AIG prevented even greater shocks to the
global financial system,” Bernanke said in slides. “Over time,
AIG stabilized. It has repaid the Fed with interest and has made
progress in reducing Treasury’s stake in the company.”  Bernanke has used his lecture series to defend the central
bank’s track record during the housing crisis and to criticize
the gold standard.  During the last three years, Bernanke has given television
interviews and appeared at town hall-style meetings. He toured a
Philadelphia shipyard and a Tasty Baking Co. cupcake factory in
2010 and last year traveled to El Paso,  Texas , to speak to
soldiers at  Fort Bliss . He also began holding press conferences
in 2011, after each of the Fed’s four two-day policy meetings.  Paul Hearing  Paul, who chairs a subcommittee of the House Financial
Services Committee, today held a hearing on the Fed’s aid to the
euro region. He said that the dollar swaps the Fed is making
available to the ECB, as well as other central banks, are being
used to “prop up a system that’s not viable.”  William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
 New York , defended the swaps, saying they have succeeded in
ensuring the flow of credit to U.S. citizens and firms that
borrow from European banks.  Bernanke’s lectures to 30 students are streamed live on the
central-bank’s  website  and on ustream.tv. Afterwards, it will be
posted on the Fed’s  YouTube page .  To contact the reporter on this story:
