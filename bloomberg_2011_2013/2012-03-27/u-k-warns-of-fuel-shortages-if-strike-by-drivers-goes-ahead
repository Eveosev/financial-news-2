U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
office warned businesses and the public to make preparations for
fuel shortages if a strike by tank-truck drivers goes ahead.  Drivers in the Unite union working for five fuel-
distribution companies whose customers include  Tesco Plc (TSCO) , J.
Sainsbury Plc,  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)   voted yesterday
to strike  in protest at working conditions and changes to their
pensions.  In 2000, protests outside oil refineries by farmers and
truck drivers at the high price of gasoline led to panic-buying,
nationwide shortages and rationing. Cameron’s spokeswoman,
Vickie Sheriff, said today that even if army drivers were
trained to drive the trucks during a strike, there would still
be shortfalls.  “It would have an impact on people’s daily lives,” she
said. “People should draw their own conclusions, but clearly
businesses should draw up their own contingency plans.”  Unite now has 28 days to set a strike date, for which it
must give seven days’ notice. The government is in talks with
the fuel companies, which include  Wincanton Plc (WIN)  and  Norbert
Dentressangle SA (GND) , about getting army drivers qualified to use
their equipment, which requires eight days’ training.  The union said in an e-mailed statement today that it wants
to avoid a strike and called on Energy Secretary Ed Davey to
push employers into talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
