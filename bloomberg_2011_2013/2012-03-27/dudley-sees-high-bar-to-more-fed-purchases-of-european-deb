Federal Reserve  Bank of New York
President  William Dudley  said that the central bank holds a very
small amount of European sovereign debt and that he sees a
“high bar” to additional purchases.  The standard for buying more European sovereign debt “is
extraordinarily high for the U.S., for the Federal Reserve, to
actually go out and buy foreign sovereign debt for its own
portfolio, apart from the very small foreign exchange holdings
that we have,” Dudley said today to a House Financial Services
subcommittee hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
