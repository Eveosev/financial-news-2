Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said multilateral development banks were crucial in the
aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and are vital for
addressing “the challenges of the moment.”  The lenders, including the  World Bank , “helped lay the
groundwork for the sustainable and inclusive growth that has
driven rapid increases in U.S. exports” to countries such as
South Korea and  India , Geithner said in testimony prepared for a
hearing today before a House Appropriations subcommittee.  “These institutions have proven their worth,” Geithner
said. “They were indispensable in stabilizing the global
economy during the recent financial crisis. They are vital for
addressing the challenges of the moment and will be integral for
responding to changes that lie beyond the horizon.”  Geithner said the Treasury’s fiscal year 2013 budget
request of $2.9 billion for international programs is 13.7
percent less than its fiscal year 2012 proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
