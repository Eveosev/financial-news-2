 Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande â€™s lead over President  Nicolas Sarkozy  narrowed in the
past week after police killed a self-declared Islamist terrorist
in Toulouse, two polls said.  Hollande would beat Sarkozy by 54 percent to 46 percent in
the decisive run-off May 6, according to both a Harris
Interactive poll and an Ipsos survey. In both cases, the
previous poll showed a 56 percent to 44 percent gap.  Under the French system, a run-off will be held if no one
takes a majority in the April 22 first round. In that initial
stage of voting, Sarkozy would take 28 percent, Hollande 27
percent, anti-immigrant campaigner Marine le Pen 16 percent, and
anti-free market leader Jean-Luc Melenchon 13 percent, the
Harris poll for television station La Chaine Parlementaire.  The Ipsos poll for Le Monde showed Hollande leading the
first round with 28 percent, followed by Sarkozy at 27.5
percent. Next was Le Pen at 16 percent.  The Harris poll involved 1,231 people questioned March 22
to 26. Ipsos questioned 978 people on March 23 and 24. No
margins of error were given.  The polls were held after French police March 22 killed
Mohamed Merah, a 23-year old who had murdered three soldiers,
three Jewish children, and a French-Israeli teacher in a nine-
day killing spree.  To contact the reporter on this story:
