McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR)  plunged the
most in more than five months after announcing an equipment
malfunction related to the Davy Jones No. 1 well in the  Gulf of
Mexico .  McMoRan  tumbled  7.5 percent to $11.23 at the close in  New
York , the most since Oct. 3.  Hydraulic perforating equipment malfunctioned during
activities at the operation’s Wilcox “F” sand, New Orleans-
based McMoRan said in a statement released after the close of
regular U.S. trading yesterday. The company hasn’t completed
flow testing at the Davy Jones No. 1 well, it said.  McMoRan sought to perforate Wilcox “C” sand yesterday and
the well began to flow as equipment was being removed, according
to a statement issued today. A test in Wilcox “D” sand also
resulted in a flare. The flow from the “D” sand is being
affected by debris and results from a cleaner test will be
announced at a later date, the company said.  The company previously said it drilled two successful sub-
salt wells in the Davy Jones field.  McMoRan operates and has a 63.4 percent working interest in
Davy Jones. Other partners include Energy XXI, JX Nippon Oil
Exploration (Gulf) Ltd. and Moncrief Offshore LLC, according to
the statements.  Davy Jones is in the same geologic layer that yielded  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s billion-barrel Tiber field and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Jack
discovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
