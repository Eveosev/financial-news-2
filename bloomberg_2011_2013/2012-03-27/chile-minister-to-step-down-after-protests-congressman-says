Chile ’s Energy Minister Rodrigo
Alvarez submitted his resignation following two months of
protests in the southern region of Aysen, Patricio Melero, a
member of the lower house of congress, told Radio Cooperativa.  Alvarez resigned after being excluded from talks that ended
the conflict over fuel prices, said Melero, who will become the
next president of UDI, one of Chile’s ruling political parties.
President Sebastian Pinera is a member of the other ruling party
Renovacion Nacional. The government hasn’t confirmed or denied
that Alvarez submitted his resignation.  Alvarez, an UDI member, is Pinera’s fourth energy minister
since the billionaire entrepreneur-turned-politician took office
in March 2010. Chile, the world’s largest copper producer,
imports more than 90 percent of its fossil fuel needs.  The government signed a deal with Aysen community leaders
in Santiago on March 23, ending two months of sometimes violent
protests in the Patagonia region over petroleum and firewood
subsidies. Calls to the energy ministry’s communications
department weren’t answered.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporters on this story:
