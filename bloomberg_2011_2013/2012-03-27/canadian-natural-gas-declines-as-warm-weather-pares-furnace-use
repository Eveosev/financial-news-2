Canadian natural gas fell, tracking
a decline in New York futures, as warmer-than-normal U.S.
weather pared furnace use and allowed stockpiles to grow.  Alberta  gas declined 3 percent. Demand for heat across the
U.S. will trail normal by 38 percent through April 3, according
to Weather Derivatives. The warmest winter since 2000 allowed
stockpiles of the fuel to climb to 54 percent above the five-
year average as of March 16, according to the  Energy Department (DOENUST5) .  “There’s little demand to be seen,” said Eric Bickel, a
natural gas analyst at Summit Energy Services in Louisville,
Kentucky. “There will be downward pressure on gas prices until
we see cooling demand coming in.”  Alberta gas for April delivery fell 5.25 cents to $1.68 a
gigajoule ($1.60 per million British thermal units) as of 3:15
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
is down 41 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas touched C$1.625 a gigajoule March 8, the lowest for the
April near-month contract since it started trading in 2000.  Natural gas for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 1.8 cents to settle at $2.208 per million Btu
after dropping to $2.176, the lowest intraday price since
February 2002.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago 
declined 7.23 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $2.068 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas dropped 14.3 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $1.8726 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, gas fell 15.69 cents, or 7.3 percent, to
$1.9866.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 17.3 billion cubic
feet, 479 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.03 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.21 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.08 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.58 billion cubic feet today, or 59 percent
of its capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.98
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
