Spanish two-year note erased an
advance after the nation sold 2.58 billion euros of three- and
six-month bills compared with a maximum target of 3 billion
euros.   The yield on the securities was little changed at 2.45
percent as of 9:46 a.m. London time. It earlier fell as much as
two basis points.  The bid-to-cover for the three-month debt was 3.51, the
Bank of  Spain  said, compared with 4.04 when the securities were
last sold on Feb. 21. Demand for the six-month bills was 5.56
times the amount sold, compared with 10.2 last month.  The average three-month yield was 0.381 percent, compared
with 0.396 percent in February and the average rate on the six-
month bills was 0.836 percent, compared with 0.764 percent last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
