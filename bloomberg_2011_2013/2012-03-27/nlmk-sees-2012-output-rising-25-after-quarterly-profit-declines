OAO  Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK) , Russian
billionaire  Vladimir Lisin ’s steelmaker, plans to raise crude
steel production at least 25 percent this year after quarterly
earnings dropped on its buyout of international assets.  NLMK, as the producer is known, expects crude output to
rise to at least 15 million metric tons from 12 million tons
last year, according to a company statement today. First-quarter
production rose 14 percent from the last three months of 2011 to
3.6 million tons, according to a  presentation  on NLMK’s website.  The steelmaker is seeking larger production volumes after
its fourth-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization dropped 20 percent to $383 million from the
previous three months, it said today. That missed the average
estimate of $411 million from 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Ebitda margin dropped to a historically low level of 13
percent in the period, said Dmitry Smolin, a metals analyst at
UralSib Capital in Moscow. “Even in the post-crisis first
quarter of 2009 the margin was 15 percent.”  Net income declined 32 percent to $153 million in the
fourth quarter, while revenue fell 8 percent to $3 billion.  Profit Squeeze  The steelmaker’s profitability was squeezed by the
performance of its international assets after NLMK bought
Duferco Group out of jointly owned plants in  Europe  last year,
Smolin said. The purchase boosted NLMK’s total debt to $4.38
billion at the end of 2011, according to the statement.  The international assets will be consolidated for the first
full year in 2012. NLMK may open a mill in  Russia ’s Kaluga
region this year, after starting a new blast furnace in Lipetsk,
where it’s headquartered, as it expands at home.  NLMK reported full-year revenue of $11.7 billion, an
increase of 40 percent from 2010. Ebitda fell 3 percent to $2.3
billion, with a margin of 19 percent of revenue. Net income rose
8 percent to $1.36 billion.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  forecasts NLMK’s Ebitda to increase to $2.55
billion this year with the margin remaining at 19 percent as
steel prices hold steady, according to a report yesterday from
the bank.  NLMK aims to raise its Ebitda margin to at least 25 percent
in the “longer term” after completing new projects and
integrating new assets, Chief Financial Officer Galina Aglyamova
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
