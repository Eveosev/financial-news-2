Gunmen in the northeastern Nigerian
state of Borno killed two people yesterday, including a former
deputy controller of prisons in the state capital, Maiduguri,
police said.  Abdullahi Bello was shot in front of his house with a
friend, a spokesman for the police in Maiduguri, Samuel Tizhe,
said today by phone.  Maiduguri has been the center of a violent campaign by the
Islamist Boko Haram to impose Sharian law in  Africa ’s top oil
producer.  The government blames Boko Haram, which draws inspiration
from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for a surge of violence in
the mainly Muslim north and in Abuja, the capital, since 2009.  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a
sin,” claimed responsibility for multiple blasts and attacks in
the city of Kano on Jan. 20 that killed at least 256 people,
according to the Civil Rights Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
