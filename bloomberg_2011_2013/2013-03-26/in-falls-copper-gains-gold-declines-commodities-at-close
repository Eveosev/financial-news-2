contract  BASE METALS  Tin fell the most in a week as inventories in London Metal

months. Copper gained as a strike at a main export terminal in
 Chile  continued.  Tin for delivery in three months lost as much as 1.4
percent, the most since March 19, to $22,866 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange and was at $22,999 at 2:35 p.m. Shanghai
time. Copper rose as much as 0.5 percent to $7,655 a ton.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fell for a third day, poised for the worst run in
three weeks, as Cyprus’s bailout damped haven demand even amid
concern that its bank-restructuring plan may be used as a
template for other European nations.  Gold for immediate delivery lost as much as 0.3 percent to
$1,600.14 an ounce and was at $1,602.53 at 3 p.m. in Singapore.
Prices touched $1,589.87 yesterday, the lowest since March 15,
as the rescue ensured Cyprus averted default. The last time gold
fell for at least three days was the period to March 4. amid
signs that the U.S. recovery is gaining traction.  Gold for June delivery lost 0.2 percent to $1,603.30 an
ounce on the Comex in New York. Platinum dropped 0.6 percent to
$1,576.50 an ounce even as holdings in ETPs gained to an all-
time high of 52.144 tons.  Spot silver dropped 0.2 percent to $28.78 an ounce, while
palladium was little changed at $757.85 an ounce.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn dropped, as the CME Group raised the initial margins
for futures contracts for the new crop, adding to disincentives
for investors already concerned that supplies may rise as
farmers in the U.S. boost planting.  The grain for delivery in May lost as much as 0.4 percent
to $7.3025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$7.3125 at 2:11 p.m. Singapore time. Trading volume was 44
percent lower than the 100-day average for that time of day.  The margin for speculative traders will rise to $2,700 at
the end of business today from $2,025, the CME said in a
statement. For hedgers and members the margin would be $2,000,
up from $1,500, it said.  Soybeans for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to $14.35 a
bushel, while wheat futures were little changed at $7.2675.  Rubber fell as Japan’s currency gained, cutting the appeal
of yen-denominated contracts, amid concern Cyprus’s bank-
restructuring plan will be a template for other European
nations, imperiling bondholders and depositors.  The contract for delivery in August lost 1.2 percent to end
at 276.1 yen a kilogram ($2,930 a metric ton) on the Tokyo

stockpiles in  Malaysia , the world’s second-biggest producer
after  Indonesia , may climb as exports decline.  The contract for delivery in June dropped as much as 1.1
percent to 2,436 ringgit ($787) a metric ton on the Malaysia
