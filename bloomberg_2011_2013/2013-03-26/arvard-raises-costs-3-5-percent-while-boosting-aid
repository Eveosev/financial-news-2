Harvard University  plans to raise
the price of tuition, room, board and fees for undergraduates in
the next academic year by a combined 3.5 percent to $56,407.  Harvard College ’s cost in the 2013-2014 academic year will
affect students who don’t receive need-based financial aid,
according to a  statement  today from the Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based institution. The school’s aid budget will
increase by $10 million, or 5.8 percent, to $182 million.  More than 60 percent of Harvard undergraduates annually
receive scholarships based on financial need, paying on average
$12,000 toward the cost of tuition, room and board, Harvard
said. About 20 percent of families pay nothing, the school said.  “Despite the budget challenges posed by less-than-robust
endowment returns and threatened federal funding cuts, I’m
pleased that we have again renewed our commitment to making a
Harvard College education affordable for any student, regardless
of financial means,” Michael D. Smith, dean of Faculty of Arts
and Sciences, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
