Icelandâ€™s annual inflation rate
fell this month after currency interventions boosted the krona,
easing the pressure on Sedlabanki to raise  interest rates .  Inflation slowed to an annual 3.9 percent in March from 4.8
percent the prior month, Reykjavik-based  Statistics Iceland  said
today on its website. Consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in the
month, the agency said.  The  central bank  this month kept its benchmark rate at 6
percent as policy makers try to support the krona while they
scale back currency restrictions. The bank, which targets 2.5
percent inflation, forecasts that consumer prices will average
3.6 this year and slow to 2.7 percent in 2014.  The krona has risen 8.6 percent against the euro since Jan.
30 after the central bank started buying the currency last
month. A stronger currency reduced import costs.  Iceland imposed currency restrictions in 2008 following the
failure of  Kaupthing Bank hf ,  Glitnir Bank hf  and  Landsbanki
Islands hf  after the krona sank 80 percent against the euro
offshore. Arion Bank hf, the state-created successor to
Kaupthing, has estimated the controls are stopping as much as $8
billion in offshore krona assets from being sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
