Steel reinforcement-bar futures
fell for the second time in three days in  China  as banks began
implementing measures to prevent a housing bubble, which may cut
demand for the material used in construction.  The contract for October delivery fell as much as 1.1
percent to 3,868  yuan  ($623) a metric ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange and was at 3,879 yuan at 10:07 a.m. local time.  Some banks in China have started to control the scale of
loans for real estate development to coordinate with new
property curbs, the official China Securities Journal reported
today. China’s cabinet on March 1 imposed its toughest curbs in
a year, ordering the central bank to raise down-payment
requirements and  interest rates  for second mortgages in cities
with excessive price gains.  “Tough property measures are making people more nervous
and that’s taking support off rebar,” Wu Zhili, analyst at
Shenhua Futures Co., said from Shenzhen.  The average spot  price  of rebar fell 0.4 percent to 3,673
yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port rose 0.5 percent
to $136 a dry ton on the same day, according to The Steel Index
Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
