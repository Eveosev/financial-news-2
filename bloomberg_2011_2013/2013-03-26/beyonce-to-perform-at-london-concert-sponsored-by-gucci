Beyonce will perform at a June 1
concert in  London  in support of a women’s empowerment campaign
founded by Gucci, organizers said at a media briefing in London.  The concert at Twickenham Stadium will also feature Ellie
Goulding, Florence + the Machine,  HAIM ,  Iggy Azalea , John Legend,  Laura Pausini ,  Rita Ora  and Timbaland, among others.  The concert will be paid for by Gucci, allowing proceeds of
ticket sales to go toward the Gucci-founded  Chime for Change 
campaign to help women and girls improve their prospects.  “We live in a world where millions of girls and women are
struggling for their rights: for education, health and justice,”
said actress Salma Hayek Pinault, who is on the campaign’s
founding committee along with Beyonce. She is married to
billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, whose  PPR SA (PP)  owns Gucci.  Tickets to the concert will be on sale from tomorrow via
www.chimeforchange.org and Ticketmaster.  (Farah Nayeri writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
