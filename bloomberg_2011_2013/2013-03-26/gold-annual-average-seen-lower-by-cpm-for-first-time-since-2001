Gold prices on average may fall
this year for the first time since 2001 as investors shift
“away from extreme expectations of an imminent collapse of the
global financial system,” CPM Group said.  The metal may average $1,565 an ounce in 2013, Jeffrey Christian, the managing director of New York-based CPM, said in
an interview before the release today of the research company’s
“Gold Yearbook 2013.” That’s down 6.2 percent from the spot
average of $1,668.75 in 2012.  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by the metal as
of yesterday tumbled 177 metric tons this year, or 6.7 percent,
 data  compiled by Bloomberg show. Billionaire  George Soros  cut
his stake in the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest ETP, by 55 percent
in the fourth quarter.  Investors perceive that “the global economy is likely to
muddle along,” CPM said in a statement. “Present sentiment has
reduced the urgency” to add gold to portfolios after the price
average rose to a record last year, the company said.  Yesterday, gold for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1,605.09. The price has dropped 4.2 percent in 2013. The metal
posted gains in the previous 12 years. The commodity surged to a
record $1,921.15 in September 2011 as global interest rates
remained low, while the U.S.,  Europe  and  Japan  expanded monetary
stimulus.  Investors bought 38.7 million ounces of gold last year,
down 4.8 percent from 2011, while central banks and government
institutions increased holdings by 9.5 million ounces, CPM said.  Newly refined supplies dropped 0.6 percent to 119 million
ounces last year, partly because mines in South Africa were
disrupted by labor disputes, CPM said. Output will increase in
2013, CPM said without giving a figure.  Fabrication demand climbed 1.4 percent to 70.8 million
ounces in 2012, boosted by jewelry sales, CPM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
