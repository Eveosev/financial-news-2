Celesio AG (CLS1)  gained the most in five
months in Frankfurt trading after the German drug wholesaler’s
2012 profit rose more than forecast.  Celesio climbed 3.4 percent to 14.41 euros at 1:30 p.m.
local time, giving the company a market value of 2.5 billion
euros ($3.2 billion). The stock’s intraday advance was the
biggest since Oct. 16.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization excluding some costs climbed 4.5 percent last year
to 579.6 million euros, the company said in a statement today.
Celesio had predicted that profit would at least match the 2011
level.  “Our most important short-term goal was the stabilization
of our business in 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Markus Pinger
said at a news conference in Stuttgart, where the company is
based.  Adjusted Ebitda this year will be 580 million euros to 610
million euros, the company said. The average of 12 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg is 606.4 million euros.  “We expect the current year to continue to be difficult,”
Pinger said. “We expect more austerity measures in several
European countries. We see a massive price war in  Germany  that
is putting pressure on the whole segment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
