Supervalu Inc. (SVU) , the grocery-store
operator that sold five brands to a private-equity led group
last week, plans to eliminate 1,100 jobs as it trims costs amid
falling sales.  The cuts, which will come from its corporate and store-
support offices, include current positions and open jobs that
won’t be filled, the  Eden Prairie , Minnesota-based company said
today in a statement. The reductions represent about 3.1 percent
of the workforce for the company, which has about 35,000
employees.  The grocery chain has eliminated jobs and accelerated price
cuts at stores as it struggles to keep pace with discounters
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and  Target Corp. (TGT)  Supervalu  sales 
have fallen for three straight years.  A Cerberus Capital Management LP-led investor group in
January agreed to acquire Supervalu’s Albertsons, Acme, Jewel-
Osco, Shaw’s and Star Market grocery stores in a transaction
valued at about $3.3 billion. The deal was completed March 21,
Supervalu said today.  Supervalu  rose  1.4 percent to $5.12 at the close in  New
York . The shares have more than doubled this year, compared with
a 9.6 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
