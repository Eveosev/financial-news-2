Future Capital Partners Ltd., a
London-based investment company, bought U.S. bio-ethanol maker
Appomattox Bio Energy LLC for $220 million and will use some of
its equipment to start a plant in the U.K.  The company will sell Appomattox’s land, plant and
machinery to the Future Fuels Partnership that it set up to
build a bio-ethanol refinery in Grimsby, northern  England , it
said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Grimsby project, which has the potential to deliver as
much as 15 to 20 percent of Britain’s bio-ethanol requirements
by 2016, was originally to be built from scratch, according to
the statement. The acquisition will lower construction costs by
about 50 million pounds ($76 million), it said.  “This is a really exciting development for Future Fuels,
allowing the project to re-open to new investors seeking
significant return potential as well as affording substantial
downside risk protection,” Jonathan Turney, associate director
for renewable energy at Future Capital, said in the statement.  The Grimsby plant will be operated by Vireol Ltd, according
to the statement. Bio-ethanol can be added to petrol to power
vehicles, thereby lowering their emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
