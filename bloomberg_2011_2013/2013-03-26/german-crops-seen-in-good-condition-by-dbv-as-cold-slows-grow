Germany ’s grain and rapeseed crops
are in good condition after “long-lasting winter weather” and
unlike last year, no major winterkill damage occurred, farm
lobby Deutscher Bauernverband said.  Snow protected crops from moisture loss during periods of
freezing, the Berlin-based DBV wrote in a  report  on its website
today. Potential damage from asphyxiation, which can occur under
ice sheets, will only been assessable after the snow cover has
melted, according to the group.  Cold weather delayed spring field work including fertilizer
application, sowing and planting of early potatoes, the DBV
said. Potatoes require a soil temperature of 5 degrees Celsius
(41 degrees Fahrenheit) to grow, while corn needs 8 degrees, it
said.  “Coming weeks may result in peak labor for farmers when
temperatures start rising again,” the DBV said. “The various
crops should catch up on the delays once further vegetation
development again corresponds to the time of year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
