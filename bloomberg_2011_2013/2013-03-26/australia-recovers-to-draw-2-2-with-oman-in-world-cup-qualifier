Australia recovered from 2-0 down
to draw 2-2 with Oman in a soccer World Cup qualifier last
night.  Tim Cahill  and  Brett Holman  got the Socceroos’ goals after
Abdulaziz Al-Muqbali and an own goal by Mile Jedinak threatened
an upset win for the visitors in Sydney.  “It’s disappointing,” Cahill said in a televised
interview. “These are home games and we need to win them. We
should be doing a lot better than this.”  The result moves both teams to six points in Asia's Group B.
Japan, on 13, needs only a draw in Jordan to become the first
team to qualify for the World Cup in Brazil next year.  South Korea beat Qatar 2-1 in Seoul and leads Group A
on 10 points.  The winners and runners-up from each five-team group take
the region’s four direct berths in the 32-team tournament, with
the third-place teams playing off for the right to take on  South
America ’s fifth-ranked nation for another spot.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
