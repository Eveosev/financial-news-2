Bovespa-index futures advanced after
a report showing industrial production contracted more than
expected spurred traders to increase bets that  Brazil  may hold
the benchmark lending rate at a record low for longer.  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  may move after executive director Sergio Clemente said the Brazilian bank is planning to expand in Latin
America and the U.K. Homebuilder  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  may be
active after saying it will turn away from government-sponsored
projects aimed at low-income families in favor of higher-end
projects in its 2013-2015 business plan.  Bovespa-index  futures contracts  expiring in April climbed
0.4 percent to 56,150 at 9:09 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Brazil’s swap
rates on contracts due in January 2015 fell 0.05 percentage
point to 8.44 percent. The real gained 0.2 percent to 2.0178 per
dollar.  Industrial production  contracted 3.2 percent in February
from a year earlier, after growing a revised 5.5 percent in the
prior month, Brazil’s statistics agency reported today. The
median forecast of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for
output to shrink 2.4 percent.  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  has retreated 12 percent from this year’s high
on Jan. 3 amid concern accelerating inflation may curb Brazil’s
economic recovery and the government’s interventionist policies
will hurt profits in industries including utilities and energy.
The  MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC)  of shares in Brazil,  Russia ,  India  and  China 
has lost 7 percent over the same period.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 11.1 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.6 for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 4.9 billion
reais ($2.42 billion) yesterday, which compares with a daily
average of 7.52 billion reais this year through March 28,
according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
