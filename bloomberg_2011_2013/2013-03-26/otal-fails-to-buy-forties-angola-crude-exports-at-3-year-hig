Total SA failed to buy North Sea
Forties crude even as it bid at a higher level than yesterday’s
trade. BP Plc and OAO Lukoil’s Litasco unit offered Russian
Urals grade without finding a buyer.  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will raise
exports in May to the highest in more than three years, after
one more cargo than in the preliminary plan, according to a
final loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Total bid for Forties loading from April 16 to April 22 at
65 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. That compares with a trade yesterday at minus 75
cents to the benchmark.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 15 cents to a discount of 77 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the lowest since April 19.  Brent for May settlement traded at $108.21 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $107.71 in the previous session. The June
contract was at $107.94, a discount of 27 cents to May.  The share of Buzzard in Forties rose to 44 percent for the
week ending March 24, up from 40 percent a week earlier,  BP Plc (BP/) 
said on its website. That the highest proportion since Feb. 10.  Mediterranean/Urals  BP failed to sell Urals at $2.15 a barrel less than Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the Platts survey
showed. That’s the same level as the company offered yesterday.
Litasco offered the grade at a $2.10 discount without finding a
buyer, according to the survey.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened by 4 cents to $1.03 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $2.04 a barrel,
compared with minus $1.89 in the previous session. That’s the
widest since March 12.  Russia plans to ship 1.95 million barrels a day of Urals
from two export terminals on the Baltic Sea in April, a 20
percent increase from March, a final loading program showed.  Primorsk will export 57 cargoes and Ust-Luga plans to ship
23 lots, according to the schedule obtained by Bloomberg News,
unchanged from the preliminary program. Consignments from the
ports are of 100,000 metric tons each.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold five cargoes of Urals loading from
Primorsk and Ust-Luga in April to BP,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,
Total SA and Repsol SA, according to two people with knowledge
of the matter, who asked not to be identified as the information
is confidential.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 2 cents to $3.17
a barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show. That’s the
lowest since Feb. 28.  Angola will ship 60 cargoes compared with 55 in April.
Exports will increase to 57.69 million barrels, or 1.86 million
barrels a day, the plan shows. That compares with 52.9 million
barrels, or 1.76 million barrels a day, in April, according to a
separate schedule. The country loaded 1.91 million barrels in
October 2009.  Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, will boost crude
exports to 73 cargoes in May, a partial loading program obtained
by Bloomberg News that includes 17 of 18 grades showed.  Eni SpA (ENI)  stopped oil operations in Bayelsa state swamp area
because crude theft and sabotage reached “unsustainable” peaks
of 60 percent of its output, the company said today in an e-
mailed statement. The closure will reduce crude supplies to the
Brass River Export terminal, it said.  The company’s “equity production” in Nigeria was 154,000
barrels a day in 2012, of which about 40,000 was from the swamp
area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
