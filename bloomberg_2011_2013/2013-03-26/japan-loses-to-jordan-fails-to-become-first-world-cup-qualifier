Japan missed a chance of becoming
the first nation to qualify for next year’s soccer  World Cup ,
losing 2-1 to Jordan in Amman.  Japan needed only a draw to advance after Australia tied 2-
2 with Oman in Sydney in the other Group B game in Asian
qualifying. Japan, which missed a penalty, leads the group on 13
points, followed by Jordan on seven, and Australia and Oman on
six.  In Group A,  South Korea  beat Qatar 2-1 in Seoul, and
Uzbekistan had a 1-0 win over Lebanon in Tashkent.  Uzbekistan has 11 points, followed by South Korea on 10,
Iran and Qatar on seven and Lebanon with four.  The winners and runners-up from each five-team group take
the region’s four direct berths in the 32-team tournament in
 Brazil , with the third-place teams playing off for the right to
take on South America’s fifth-ranked nation for another spot.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
