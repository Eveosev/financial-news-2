Treasuries rose, with 10-year note
yields trading in the narrowest range in two weeks, after U.S.
 consumer confidence  slid more than forecast and home sales fell.  Bonds pared gains as demand at a U.S. auction of $35
billion of two-year notes slid to the lowest level since 2011.
Treasuries declined earlier as residential real-estate prices
climbed in January by the most since June 2006. U.S. government
securities rose yesterday after Cyprus won a European Union-led
bailout that imposes losses on bondholders.  “The crosscurrents for risk are poor right now,” said
Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist BNP Paribas SA in New
York, one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal
Reserve . “The Europe story is still not resolved. U.S. data
have been mixed. It doesn’t impart a lot of direction.”  The 10-year note  yield  declined one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.91 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, after rising earlier
to 1.94 percent. It touched 1.97 percent yesterday, the highest
since March 15, and then fell to 1.89 percent, the lowest since
March 19. The price of the 2 percent debt due in February 2023
rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 100 26/32.  The benchmark yield stayed within a 4.3 basis-point range
today, the narrowest since March 11. It has traded since March
18 between 1.89 percent and 1.97 percent.  Yields on  current  two-year notes were little changed at
0.25 percent.  Lower Volume  Trading  volume  fell 8 percent to $233 billion, according to
ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government
debt . It touched a one-week high of $354 billion on March 19.
Average daily volume for the past year is $247 billion.  U.S. debt  was supported by month-end buying to match market
indexes. Funds that manage portfolios against benchmark indexes,
including the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, typically buy
longer-maturity Treasuries near month-end to align the interest-
rate sensitivity of their holdings with the indexes.  The Barclays index, which many funds use to measure their
performance, will extend its duration, the measure of rate-
sensitivity, by 0.10 year on April 1, compared with 0.11 year on
March 1.  The two-year notes auctioned today drew a  yield  of 0.255
percent, compared with a forecast of 0.256 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven primary dealers. That compared
with a yield of 0.257 at last month’s sale.  Demand Gauge  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of debt offered, was 3.27, the least
since July 2011. The ratio averaged 3.79 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 20.6 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 27.1 percent for the past 10 sales. Direct
bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, bought 21.8 percent, the least since
September. The average at the past 10 sales was 21.2 percent.  Primary dealers  purchased 57.6 percent of the notes, the
most since August.  The U.S. plans to sell $35 billion of five-year notes
tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year debt on March 28.  Investors in Treasuries cut bullish bets and increased
shorts, or bets that the securities will decline in value, in
the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The  proportion  of net shorts was at 18 percentage points,
according to a JPMorgan survey, up from 12 percentage points the
week ending March 18. The percent of outright shorts rose to 28
percent, from 27 percent, while the percent of outright longs
dropped to 10 percent from 15 percent.  Confidence Sags  Treasuries erased losses today after the Conference Board’s
 confidence  index declined to 59.7 from a revised three-month
high of 68 in February. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
projected the March measure would fall to 67.5. Sales of newly
built homes fell 4.6 percent to a 411,000 annualized pace,
Commerce Department data showed.  “Treasuries are getting tight right now,” said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&F
Man Capital Markets in New York. “Yields are compressing.
People are not selling.”  Yields rose earlier as Commerce Department data showed
 bookings  for goods meant to last at least three years rose 5.7
percent, the most since September.  The economy “is still moving along in the right
direction,” said Tom Simons, an economist in New York at the
primary dealer Jefferies LLC. “The pace of progress is somewhat
modest.”  The Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index of property values
in 20 cities climbed 8.1 percent in January from the same month
in 2012, after rising 6.8 percent in the year ended in December,
the group said today in New York.  Cyprus Deal  Treasury 10-year note yields fell to 1.89 percent yesterday
on concern a 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout of Cyprus may
undermine long-term financial stability in the euro region.  The nation agreed to shut its second-biggest bank, largely
wiping out bondholders and raising concern the restructuring
will pave the way for losses on deposits in other European
nations.  The rescue isn’t a model for future aid plans, European
Central Bank Governing Council Member Ewald Nowotny told
reporters in  Prague  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
