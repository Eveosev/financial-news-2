The baht reached its lowest level
in a week on speculation companies from  Japan , the biggest
foreign investor in  Thailand , are sending profits home before
the end of the fiscal year on March 31. Bonds advanced.  Japanese firms accounted for 64 percent of projects
approved by the Thai Board of Investment in 2012, data compiled
by the Japan External Trade Organization show. The baht reached
its strongest level since 1997 last week and has appreciated 4.3
percent against the dollar this year, the most in  Asia , as
overseas investors  pumped  a net $9.3 billion into the nation’s
debt, Thai Bond Market Association data show.  “We have a lot of Japanese companies in Thailand and this
is the end of their fiscal year, so Japanese companies sending
money back home puts some downward pressure on the baht,” said
Pareena Phuangsiri, a Bangkok-based analyst at  Kasikornbank Pcl. (KBANK) 
Inflows will continue and the baht will probably stay near the
current level, she said.  The baht dropped 0.2 percent to 29.35 per dollar as of 3:12
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 29.41 earlier, the lowest level since March 19. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, rose seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 5.21 percent.  Non-resident investors’ net holdings of sovereign debt
accounted for 9.76 percent of the total outstanding value as of
March 22, up from 8.29 percent on Dec. 28, according to Thai
Bond Market Association data. The currency reached 29.08 per
dollar on March 20, the strongest since July 1997.  Thai imports probably climbed 11 percent in February after
surging 41 percent the previous month, while exports declined
0.2 percent after a 16 percent increase, according to median
estimates in a Bloomberg survey before a government report on
March 28.  The yield on the government’s 3.625 percent bonds due June
2023 fell one basis point to 3.53 percent, the lowest level
since Nov. 28, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
