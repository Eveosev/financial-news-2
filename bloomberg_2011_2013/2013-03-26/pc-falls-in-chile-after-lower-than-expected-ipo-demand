Empresa Constructora Moller y
Perez-Cotapos SA  fell in its debut as investors who padded their
orders for the engineering group’s shares were left holding more
than they wanted after demand was lower than expected.  Moller retreated 2.5 percent to 390 pesos at 10:48 a.m. in
Santiago. The Ipsa benchmark index advanced 0.8 percent.  The company sold 105 million shares at 400 pesos each in an
initial public offering today, raising about $89 million,
according to a regulatory filing. The stock fell as investors
who had offered to buy more than they thought they would receive
were allocated more than they expected at the IPO and were
selling the remainder, German Guerrero, a partner at brokerage
MBI Servicios Financieros, said in a phone interview from
Santiago.  “In a typical IPO in  Chile , investors are allocated about
20 percent of the shares they offer to buy, and in this case
they got much more than that,” Guerrero said. “It means that
at that price, demand from the market wasn’t very high.”  Investment funds and pension funds were allocated 94
percent of the shares they offered to buy, while retail
investors were given 79 percent, according to a statement on the
exchange’s website.  “In a choppy environment like this one, investors also
tend to overlook cyclical sectors such as engineering and
construction,” Guerrero said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
