Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
has hired Stephen Chronert, the former head of high-yield bond
and leveraged loan sales in the U.S. at  UBS AG (UBSN) , for a similar
role at Britain’s biggest government-owned lender.  Chronert will be based in Stamford, Connecticut, reporting
to Rich Tang, the head of North America sales and senior
relationship management.  Ed Canaday , a spokesman for RBS,
confirmed the appointment today in an e-mail.  Chronert has more than 25 years of experience in high-yield
sales, including roles at  Credit Suisse First Boston  starting in
1986 and UBS beginning in 1999, according to records maintained
by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He left UBS in
August after Switzerland’s biggest bank cut its 2011 bonus pool
by 40 percent.  RBS is ranked as the 14th most-active manager of
speculative-grade bond sales in the U.S. and the 17th-biggest
leveraged-loan underwriter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Speculative-grade companies have borrowed $235.2
billion in the loan market this year, a record for the period,
and junk-bond issuance has reached $106.6 billion in 2013.  “I am looking forward to reuniting with Steve, having
previously worked together for seven years at UBS, and enhancing
our market position in high-yield debt,”  Richard Smith , head of
high-yield debt capital markets at RBS, said in a statement.  Leveraged loans and high-yield, high-risk, or junk, bonds
are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than
BBB- at Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
