Colombian bond yields dropped the
most in three years after the central bank unexpectedly lowered
borrowing costs last week by a half-percentage point, citing
weak growth and slower-than-target inflation.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell 25 basis points, or
0.25 percentage point, to 4.86 percent at 10:12 a.m. in Bogota,
according to the central bank. The drop was the biggest on a
closing basis since May 2010. Colombian markets were closed
yesterday for a national holiday.  Banco de la Republica accelerated the pace of reductions in
borrowing costs when it cut the target lending rate by 50 basis
points to 3.25 percent on March 22. Policy makers reduced
benchmark borrowing costs by a quarter-percentage point at each
of the central bank’s previous four meetings.  Last week’s decision surprised all 32 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, with 27 economists forecasting another quarter-point
cut last week while five projected no change.  The peso was unchanged at 1,829.10 per  U.S. dollar .  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas , who is also president
of the central bank’s board, told reporters last week after the
rate cut announcement that the lower  interest rate  will help
“break with expectations for a stronger currency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
