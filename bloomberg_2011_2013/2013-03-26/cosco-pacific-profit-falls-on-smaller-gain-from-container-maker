Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , the container-
terminal arm of China’s largest shipping group, posted a 12
percent drop in profit as a smaller gain from its stake in a
container maker outweighed cargo volume growth.  Net income  in 2012 fell to $342 million from $389 million a
year earlier, the Hong Kong-based company said in a stock
exchange filing today. Sales rose 23 percent to $735.5 million.  Cosco Pacific’s terminals, which are predominantly in
China, handled 9.8 percent more containers last year as an
improving world economy spurred demand for Chinese-made toys and
clothes. The company, whose  largest  shareholder is  China Cosco
Holdings Co. (1919) , also has facilities in countries including Greece
and Singapore.  Profit contribution from its 22 percent stake in  China
International Marine Containers Group Co. (2039) , the world’s largest
container-maker, fell 48 percent to $61.9 million, Cosco Pacific
said. China International Marine last week reported a 47 percent
slump in profit to 1.93 billion yuan. ($311 million).  Shares of Cosco Pacific fell 0.4 percent to HK$11.12 as of
1:10 p.m. in Hong Kong. The company, part of the  Hang Seng
Index , has lost 5.4 percent in the past year, compared with the
index’s 7.1 percent gain.  Cosco Pacific said excluding the share of profit from China
International Marine and other non-recurring items, its profit
rose 15 percent last year.  Cosco Pacific proposed to pay a final  dividend  of 18.3 HK
cents, up from 17.4 HK cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
