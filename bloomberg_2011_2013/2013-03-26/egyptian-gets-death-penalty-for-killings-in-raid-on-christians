A Muslim man was sentenced to death
in  Egypt  for killing two people during a dispute with Christians
in the southern Sohag province.  A court in Upper Egypt yesterday found Mahmoud Abdel Nazir
guilty also of raiding Christian houses in the November 2011
incident, state-run Middle East  News Agency  reported today.  In a separate incident yesterday, a group of Muslims
surrounded a church in Beni Suef governorate claiming local
Christians had kidnapped a young Muslim woman, and forced her to
marry a Coptic Christian before sending her to live abroad,
state-run Ahram gate said today. Security forces were deployed
to protect the church and a police station, Ahram said.  At least 12 people died and more than 50 injured when two
churches were burnt down in May 2011 in clashes that erupted
because of a rumor that a Christian woman, who had allegedly
converted to Islam, was being held hostage at a church in Imbaba
in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
