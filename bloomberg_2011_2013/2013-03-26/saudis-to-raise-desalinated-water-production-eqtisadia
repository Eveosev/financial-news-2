Saline Water Conversion Corp.  plans
to boost Saudi water production by 40 percent to 7 million cubic
meters a day by 2014, the  al-Eqtisadiah  newspaper reported,
citing SWCC Governor Abdulrahman Al-Ibrahim.  Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer with the Arab
world’s largest economy, is planning the gains through
desalinated water-purifying projects coming on line including
Ras Al Khair on the Red Sea coast, the Yanbu 3 desalination
plant, a plant in Rabigh and the Jeddah 3 desalination plant in
the second-largest city, the paper said.  “In two months, the people of Jeddah will no longer see
the fumes coming out of the desalination plant that’s one of the
sources of pollution in the city,” Al-Ibrahim was quoted as
saying, referring to the Jeddah 3 thermal desalination plant due
to shut in two months and be replaced with Jeddah 3’s reverse-
osmosis desalination plant.  Saudi Arabia  is building power stations to cope with
growing demand and desalination plants for drinking water. The
kingdom is the world’s largest producer of desalinated water, 18
percent of the production through 27 desalination plants,
according to SWCC’s annual report, Al-Eqtisadiah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
