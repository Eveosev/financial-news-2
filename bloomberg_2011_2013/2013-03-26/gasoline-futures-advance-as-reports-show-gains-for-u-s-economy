Gasoline advanced as increases in
durable goods orders and  home prices  indicated the  U.S. economy 
is strengthening and fuel demand may improve.  Futures rose 0.5 percent as  bookings  for goods meant to
last at least three years rose 5.7 percent in February, boosted
by automobiles and a rebound in commercial aircraft, a Commerce
Department report showed. Residential real estate prices
increased in January by the most since June 2006, indicating the
U.S. housing market strengthened at the start of the year.  “All of a sudden, the economy is looking a little
better,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “People feel richer when the value of
their house goes up and increased durable goods orders could
mean better demand.”  Gasoline for April delivery rose 1.54 cents to $3.078 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on volume that was 24
percent below the 100-day average at 9:41 a.m.  May gasoline’s premium over WTI narrowed 16 cents to $33.31
a barrel. The spread versus Brent widened 48 cents to $20.59.  Heating oil for April delivery fell 0.23 cent to $2.8749 a
gallon on volume that was 8.8 percent below than the 100-day
