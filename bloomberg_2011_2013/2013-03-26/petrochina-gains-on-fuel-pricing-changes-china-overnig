PetroChina (PTR)  Co. drove gains among
 Chinese equities  in New York on prospects changes to the pricing
of retail fuel will benefit oil refiners.  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  jumped
after at least five analysts upgraded the stock.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. rose 0.6 percent to a two-week
high of 92.66 yesterday. Cnooc, China’s biggest offshore oil
explorer, surged to the highest level this month, while
PetroChina, the second-largest refiner, traded at the widest
premium over its Hong Kong stock in three weeks.  LDK Solar Co. (LDK) 
sank after selling additional shares to an investor for 30
percent less than a month ago.  American depositary receipts of No. 1 refiner  China
Petroleum and Chemical Corp.  also rallied as the nation
announced changes to the mechanism for setting fuel prices that
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said may reduce processing losses for
oil companies. China is the world’s second-biggest crude
consumer. Cnooc was  raised  to the equivalent of buy by four
securities firms including Mirae Asset Securities Hong Kong Ltd.
and Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. after the company said that
it will boost production in the next two years.  “Slowly the pricing mechanism is moving to be more
responsive to the changing international oil price,” Charlie Awdry, a portfolio manager for Henderson Global Investors Ltd.’s
500 million-pound ($758 million) China Opportunities Fund, said
by e-mail from  London . “The price changes appear to be
occurring in a more timely fashion, which benefits refiners.”  ETF Advances  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., rallied 1.3 percent to $37.31
in New York, the highest close since March 15. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  climbed 0.8 percent to 1,563.77, the highest
level since October 2007.  ADRs of PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil and natural
gas producer and also a refiner, advanced 1.3 percent to
$132.13, after dropping the previous three days. The ADRs, each
representing 100 underlying shares, traded 0.7 percent above its
Hong Kong shares, the biggest premium since March 5.  China Petroleum (SNP) , known as Sinopec, added 1.3 percent in a
third day of gains to $116.54, the highest level since Feb. 1.  Price adjustments in retail fuel prices in China will be
based on the 10-day moving average cost of a basket of crudes,
down from 22 days previously, and the threshhold for triggering
a revision will be abolished, the National Development and
Reform Commission said in a statement on its website yesterday.
The changes started immediately, it said. The NDRC also cut
gasoline and diesel prices for the first time in four months,
effective today.  ‘Increase Transparency’  The new mechanism “has finally been passed and it helps
increase transparency in the sector,” Sam Mahtani, who oversees
about $5 billion as director of  emerging markets  at  F&C Asset
Management Plc (FCAM) , said by e-mail from London yesterday.  Cnooc’s ADRs surged 2.5 percent to $194.64, the highest
close since Feb. 28.  Current spending at Hong Kong-based Cnooc, which completed
the acquisition of Canada’s  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  in February, will help it
reach its annual output growth target of 6 percent to 10 percent
through 2015, Chief Financial Officer Zhong Hua said at a press
conference in Hong Kong March 22.  The company also said its board proposed a 2012  year-end
dividend  of HK$0.32 per share, up from HK$0.28 paid a year ago.
The dividend is a “bright spot,” showing the company is
confident over funding, Barclays Plc analysts led by Scott Darling wrote in a note March 25. Barclays reiterated its
recommendation of overweight, equivalent to buy. Four other
analysts raised their ratings to buy, and Jefferies Group LLC
lifted its to hold from sell.  LDK Drops  Cnooc will release a plan to integrate Nexen results in the
second half of this year, CFO Zhong said March 22. Nexen added
20 percent to Cnooc’s production and 30 percent to its reserves,
Chief Executive Officer Li Fanrong said Feb. 27 as the deal was
completed.  LDK, the biggest maker of wafers for solar cells after GCL-
Poly Energy Holdings Ltd., sold 12 million shares for $1.28 each
to Fulai Investments Ltd., it said yesterday. That was about 30
percent less than the $1.83 apiece Fulai paid for 5 million
shares of LDK last month.  The company, based in Xinyu, dropped 3.5 percent to $1.13
in New York trading, the lowest close since Dec. 11.  China Eastern Airlines Corp. (CEA)  the second-largest carrier in
China, dropped 2.2 percent to $21.39 in New York, the lowest
level in more than a week.  Airline Income  The Shanghai-based company said yesterday net income in
2012 fell 30 percent to 2.95 billion  yuan  ($470 million),
missing the 3.2 billion yuan average projection of 13 analysts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales for the year
climbed to 85.6 billion yuan from 84 billion yuan a year ago.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 0.5
percent to 10,925.13 yesterday, the biggest slump in a week. The
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares lost 1.2
percent in a second day of declines to 2,297.67.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards on the yuan
strengthened for a fifth day, adding 0.07 percent to 6.2990 per
dollar in New York, the highest level since Jan. 24, data
compile by Bloomberg show. The currency was little changed at
6.2110 per dollar in  Shanghai  yesterday, according to the  China 
Foreign Exchange Trade system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
