China’s three biggest airlines
reported a second straight decline in annual profits as they
struggled with currency fluctuations and fuel costs amid a
slower economic growth.  Air China Ltd. (753) , Asia’s biggest carrier by market value,
said yesterday that net income in 2012 fell 35 percent because
of higher expenses and a smaller gain from its stake in  Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)   China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670)  and  China
Southern Airlines Co. (1055)  also reported lower profits.  The uncertain global economic outlook and higher fuel costs
led to greater operational difficulties for the industry last
year, Air China said. The carriers said they expect domestic
demand to rebound in 2013 as China’s growth may accelerate under
the new leadership after the weakest expansion in 13 years.  “China’s big three carriers were all affected by currency
last year,” Zhou Meng, a Shanghai-based analyst at Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities Co., said. “But they are fortunate to count
on the domestic market.”  All the three airlines said their foreign exchange gains
slumped more than 90 percent in 2012 because of the  yuan ’s
slower appreciation against the dollar compared with a year
earlier. Chinese carriers benefit from a stronger local currency
as it pares the repatriated value of dollar-denominated debts
used to buy planes and fuel overseas.  Air China, based in Beijing, rose 1.8 percent to HK$6.84
at 10:40 a.m. in Hong Kong trading. China Southern was unchanged
at HK$4.29 while China Eastern gained 0.6 percent.  ‘Biggest Potential’  “China is still the market with the biggest potential in
the world,” Air China said in its statement. “At the moment,
China’s economic growth is still relatively high.”  The nation’s growth will probably accelerate this year and
next as the world’s second-biggest economy weathers a fragile
global recovery, according to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Expansion may reach 8.5 percent
this year and 8.9 percent in 2014, the OECD said on March 22.  The economy expanded 7.9 percent in the final three months
of last year, the first acceleration in two years. Full-year
growth of 7.8 percent was the least since 1999.  Air China’s net income fell to 4.64 billion yuan ($746
million), under international accounting standards, from 7.08
billion yuan a year earlier, the carrier said. That compares
with the 4.24 billion-yuan average profit estimate of 10
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Cathay Stake  The carrier’s income from its stake of about 30 percent in
Cathay plunged 91 percent to 88 million yuan after the Hong Kong
carrier suffered  an 83 percent plunge  in annual profit. Cathay
also holds about a 19.3 percent stake in the Chinese carrier.  China Eastern, the nation’s second-biggest carrier by
passengers, said profit declined to 2.95 billion yuan, trailing
the 3.20 billion-yuan average profit estimated by 13 analysts.
Net income at China Southern was 2.62 billion yuan, compared
with the average estimate of 2.78 billion yuan in a Bloomberg
survey of nine analysts.  The yuan reference rate climbed 0.3 percent against the
dollar last year, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. That compares with a 5.1 percent jump in 2011.  Air China said fuel costs rose 2.7 percent last year,
according to the H.K. filing. China Southern’s spending on fuel
jumped 14.5 percent while China Eastern had a 2.2 percent
increase.  Air China filled 80.4 percent of seats last year, 1.06
percentage points lower than a year earlier, as capacity growth
outpaced travel demand. Passenger yield, a measure of average
airfare, fell 1.47 percent, according to the company statement.
China Southern’s passenger yield dropped 1.5 percent.  IATA Forecast  Global air passenger traffic grew 5.3 percent last year,
boosted by the expansion of Middle Eastern carriers and demand
from markets in Latin America and Africa, according to the
International Air Transport Association. Asia-Pacific airlines
are expected to post a $4.2 billion profit this year, compared
with $3.9 billion in 2012, IATA has  forecast .  “The stabilized and improving economy of China, together
with positive factors such as the change of government, the
release of reform bonus and implementation of the plan for
doubling income, will result in a gradual increase in the demand
growth of the domestic aviation market,” China Southern said in
its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
