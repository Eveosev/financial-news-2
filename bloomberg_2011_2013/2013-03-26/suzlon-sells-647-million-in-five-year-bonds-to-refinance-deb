Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , the Indian
wind-turbine maker that failed to repay convertible debt last
year, completed its sale of $647 million in bonds.  Yields on the five-year notes, backed by  State Bank of
India , will be 4.97 percent, according to a  statement  today on
the company’s website. The bonds, provisionally rated Baa2, the
second-lowest investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service,
will be listed in Singapore. The funds will be used to refinance
U.S. dollar-denominated debt, the Pune-based company said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and SBICAP UK Ltd. managed the sale,
according to the statement.  India’s largest wind-turbine maker in October failed to
repay $209 million in the nation’s largest convertible-bond
default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
