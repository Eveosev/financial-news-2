President William C. Dudley said the U.S. economy is currently
facing the heaviest burden yet from federal spending cuts and
tax increases.  “Over the next three-to-six months, if the U.S. economy
continues to show signs of improvement that will be very, very
important,” Dudley said in an  interview  with CBS News that was
posted today on its website. “The fiscal drag is at its most
intense point today. If the economy can sort of power through
that, I would actually think the second half of the year and
2014 would be better.”  Dudley’s remarks echoed his speech yesterday to the
Economic Club of New York calling for “very accommodative”
monetary policy to reduce the 7.7 percent unemployment rate.  The New York Fed chief yesterday estimated that
“significantly more restrictive” fiscal policy would reduce
gross domestic product by 1.75 percent this year. That includes
federal spending cuts, the increase in the payroll tax and
higher tax rates on the highest earners, as well as tax
increases associated with the health-care overhaul.  Congress mandated $1.2 trillion in across-the-board
spending reductions, to begin this year and be spread over nine
years, as part of a 2011 deal to increase the U.S. debt limit.
The reductions are to be split almost evenly between defense and
non-defense spending.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the
cuts, known as sequestration, could subtract 0.6 percentage
point from gross domestic product in 2013, costing the economy
750,000 jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
