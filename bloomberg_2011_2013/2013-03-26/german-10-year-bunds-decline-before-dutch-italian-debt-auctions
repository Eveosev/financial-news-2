Italian bonds rose, snapping a
decline from yesterday, as European Central Bank executive board
member Benoit Coeure said the institution will do everything it
can within the terms of its mandate to preserve the euro.  Spanish securities also gained as Coeure’s comments echoed
ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s pledge in July to do “whatever it
takes” to defend the currency. So-called peripheral bonds slid
yesterday as a bailout agreement for Cyprus failed to convince
investors that fallout from its banking crisis would be
contained. German bunds fell as demand for the region’s safest
assets waned.  France  sold new 30-year bonds via banks.  “There’s still a grab for yield,” said  Marc Ostwald , a
fixed-income strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in London.
“It shows the market still believes in Draghi’s promise. The
yields in  Spain  and  Italy  are far more attractive than what you
can get in bunds.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.59 percent at 4:18 p.m.  London  time after
jumping 10 basis points yesterday. The 5.5 percent bond maturing
in November 2022 gained 0.205, or 2.05 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,286) face amount, to 107.435.  Spain’s 10-year yield dropped two basis points to 4.94
percent after declining to 4.70 percent on March 12, the lowest
level since November 2010.  ‘Do Everything’  “The ECB will do everything it can to defend the integrity
of the euro, with one qualification: it does it within the limit
of its mandate and its competences,” Coeure said on Europe 1
radio. “Cypriot banks have been supported by the ECB for
several months as it provided tens of billions of euros in
liquidity. The Cypriot financial system was kept afloat by the
ECB,” he said.  Cyprus’s bonds fell for a third day, with the yield on the
4.625 percent security due in February 2020 rising 41 basis
points to 13.86 percent. The bid price was 60.78 while the offer
price was 62.36.  While Italian borrowing costs jumped yesterday, 10-year
yields remained below the high of 4.68 percent they reached on
March 15, the day before European Union finance ministers
attempted to impose an unprecedented levy on  bank deposits  as a
condition of emergency funds to Cyprus.  “Spanish and Italian yields are still below 5 percent,”
said  Michael Markovich , head of global interest-rate research at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “Markets have really calmed
down. The ECB backstop has been the main ingredient.”  ‘Substantially Positive’  Italian bonds were also supported after Reuters reported
the  International Monetary Fund  will publish a statement on the
nation’s financial stability at 5 p.m. London time, expressing a
“substantially positive” view of banking system.  German bunds fell as the nation confirmed it would sell 65
billion euros in bonds and bills in the second quarter.  The 10-year bund yield climbed one basis point to 1.34
percent after dropping to 1.34 percent yesterday, the lowest
level since Jan. 2.  “The bond markets are moving one way and then another this
week with exaggerated moves, and now people are taking stock of
the situation,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist
at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “The
bailout seems to have been resolved but that doesn’t mean things
are better going forward. There are still many hurdles that need
to be cleared.”  France Sale  France sold 4.5 billion euros of a new bond due in May 2045
at a yield of 3.263 percent.  The Netherlands sold 2.23 billion euros of five-year notes
at a record-low yield of 0.727 percent, down from 0.884 percent
at the previous sale of the securities on Feb. 12. Italy
auctioned 8.5 billion euros of six-month bills at 0.831 percent,
versus 1.237 percent on Feb. 26.  Volatility on French bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of the Belgium and  Austria ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian bonds returned 0.9 percent this month through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
bonds earned 0.6 percent, while German bunds gained 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
