Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , the country’s
biggest phone carrier, extended the maturity of 3 billion euros
($3.9 billion) of loans to 2018.  The debt was provided by a group of 30 banks, according to
a Milan-based spokesman for Telecom Italia, who asked not to be
identified citing company policy. The deal, arranged by Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Banca IMI SpA, attracted 4.1
billion euros of commitments from lenders, the person said.  The forward-start facility, where borrowers lock in
financing terms before existing debt matures, extends part of an
8 billion-euro  credit line  due next year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The extended portion pays an initial
interest margin of 220 basis points more than the euro interbank
offered rate, the data show.  Southern European corporates, including  Telefonica SA (TEF)  of
Spain, Italy’s  Enel SpA (ENEL)  and  EDP-Energias de Portugal SA , have
raised more than 15 billion euros of forward-start loans this
year, according to Bloomberg data.  Telecom Italia extended 4 billion euros of the same loan
last year in another forward-start deal, which pays an interest
rate of 250 basis points more than benchmarks, the data show. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Banca IMI is Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA’s investment banking unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
