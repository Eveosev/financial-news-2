Taiwan’s two-year bonds rose amid
signs economic growth is slowing as industrial production and
export orders slumped before a central bank policy meeting this
week. The local dollar was steady.  Industrial production shrank 11.5 percent in February from
a year earlier, the government announced after the market closed
yesterday. Export orders fell 14.5 percent that month, the most
since May 2009, a separate report on March 20 showed. The
central bank will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at 1.875
percent at its review on March 28, according to all 11
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Yields are lower as stock-market losses show people are
still wary of the Europe debt crisis,” said Ray Cheng, bond
trader at Sinopac Securities Corp. in Taipei. “The economic
outlook remains unclear.”  The yield on the 0.625 percent government bonds due
February 2015 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 0.73 percent as of 10:36 a.m. in Taipei, according to
Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending  rate
was steady at 0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  ING Groep NV may cut its first-quarter growth forecast of
3.9 percent for  Taiwan , the Dutch lender said in a note to
clients today, citing weaker production. The island’s economy is
likely to expand 1.5 percent, compared with 3.7 percent in the
final quarter of 2012, it said.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.863
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
Three-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.1 percent to
NT$29.779 in  Hong Kong . One-month implied volatility, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
two basis points to 3.51 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Taiwan’s central bank has sold the local currency in the
run-up to the close on most days in the past year, according to
traders who asked not to be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
