The  New York  Yankees acquired
three-time All-Star outfielder Vernon Wells from the Los Angeles
Angels to bolster a roster thinned by injuries to starters
Curtis Granderson, Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira.  The Yankees also signed 36-year-old first baseman Lyle Overbay, who has played for five Major League Baseball teams
over the past 12 years, to a minor-league contract.  Wells, 34, has 259 home runs over 14 major-league seasons
and waived a no-trade clause in his contract, which had two
years and $42 million remaining, to join the Yankees. New York
sent a pair of minor leaguers -- outfielder Exircado Cayones and
pitcher Kramer Sneed -- to the Angels for Wells and an
undisclosed amount of cash.  With Granderson, Teixeira, Jeter and Rodriguez injured, and
Russell Martin, Raul Ibanez, Nick Swisher, Eric Chavez and
Andruw Jones having left in the offseason, the Yankees will
enter this campaign without players who combined for 206 homers
last year.  Wells has a career .273 batting average with 908 runs
batted in and has hit 20 or more home runs in a season eight
times. He struggled with the Angels the past two years after
being acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays, batting .222 with 36
home runs and 95 RBIs.  Wells lost his starting job last season with the emergence
of rookie Mike Trout, who finished second in the American League
Most Valuable Player voting, and was set to be a reserve
outfielder again this season.  Overbay has a lifetime .270 batting average, 133 homers and
581 RBI with  Arizona ,  Milwaukee , Toronto, Atlanta and
Pittsburgh. A left-handed hitter, Overbay played in 65 games
last season for the Diamondbacks and Braves, hitting .259 with
two home runs and 10 RBI.  In 18 games at the current Yankee Stadium, Overbay has
batted .311 (19-for-61) with three home runs.  The Yankees open the season on April 1 when they host the
Boston Red Sox.  To contact the reporter on this story:
