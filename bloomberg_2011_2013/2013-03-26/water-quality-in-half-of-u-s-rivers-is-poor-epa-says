The water quality in most U.S.
rivers and streams required to support aquatic life is “poor,”
with species endangered by increasing pollution and erosion,
according to an Environmental Protection Agency  survey .  Data from 2,000 rivers and streams in 2008-2009, the most
recent figures available, showed 55 percent of waterways to be
in “poor condition for aquatic life” with a dearth of
vegetation worsening erosion, according to the EPA  statement .  “This new science shows that America’s streams and rivers
are under significant pressure,” Nancy Stoner, EPA’s acting
assistant administrator for water, said in the statement.  Excessive nitrogen was found in 27 percent of the rivers
and streams, and high levels of phosphorus were present in 40
percent, according to today’s statement. Such “nutrient
pollution” increases algae levels and decreases oxygen required
by fish and other aquatic life. Other water bodies showed
increases in bacteria and mercury that’s a health risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
