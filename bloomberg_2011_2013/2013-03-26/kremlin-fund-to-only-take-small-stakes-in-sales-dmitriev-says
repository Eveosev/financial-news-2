The Russian Direct Investment Fund
will focus on attracting investors to the government’s $14
billion asset sales rather than taking large shareholdings
itself, Chief Executive Officer Kirill Dmitriev said.  “If we’re very active that could mean that money just goes
from one part of the government to another part of the
government,” Dmitriev said today in an interview in Durban,
South Africa. “So even if we participate, which is a very big
‘if,’ we’ll come for a very small percentage.”  The government plans share offerings for companies from VTB
Group,  Russia ’s second-biggest lender, to OAO Sovcomflot, the
largest shipper, and OAO Alrosa, the nation’s diamond monopoly.
The sales should take place mainly on Russian exchanges, Putin
said at his residence in Novo-Ogarevo, according to a transcript
on the Kremlin website posted on Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
