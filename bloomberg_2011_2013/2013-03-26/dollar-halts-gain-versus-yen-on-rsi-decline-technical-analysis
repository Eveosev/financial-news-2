The dollar’s advance versus the yen
may stall, Citigroup Inc. said, citing declines in its relative
strength index.  The greenback’s 14-day RSI against its Japanese counterpart
was 50.4 today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
near the neckline of 50 in a so-called head-and-shoulders chart
formation, and a drop below this level may indicate a pause in
the U.S. currency’s rally, Citigroup foreign-exchange strategist
 Osamu Takashima  wrote today in a note to clients.  “The RSI has trended down since early January,” Tokyo-
based Takashima wrote. “When the RSI has breached below the
line, we need to consider the dollar-yen uptrend must have been
terminated at the high at 96.7 early this month.”  The dollar added 0.1 percent to 94.28 yen as of 12:12 p.m.
in  Tokyo . It touched 96.71 on March 12, the strongest level
since 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. currency’s RSI has fallen from this year’s high of
85.7 reached on Jan. 4. Gains toward 70 may indicate to some
traders that an asset has risen too far, too fast and may be due
to reverse course, while a decline toward 30 may be seen as a
sign it has fallen too rapidly. The 50 level “is usually
regarded as a diverging point whether the momentum is tilted
upward or downward,” Takashima wrote in the report.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
