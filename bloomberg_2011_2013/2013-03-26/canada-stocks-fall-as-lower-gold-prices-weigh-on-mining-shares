Canadian  stocks  fell as gold
producers tumbled after Cyprus’s bailout deal and better-than-
estimated U.S. economic data sent the metal’s price lower for a
third day.  Yamana Gold Inc. and Goldcorp Inc. each dropped 0.9
percent.  Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ)  declined 2 percent after
results missed analysts’ expectations. Royal Bank of Canada, the
nation’s largest lender, and Bank of Nova Scotia gained more
than 0.1 percent after Canada’s government said the country’s
six largest banks are “systemically important” and need to set
aside more capital.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 15.22
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,665.49 at 12:45 p.m. in Toronto.
The S&P/TSX is up 1.9 percent for the year. Trading volume was
31 percent lower than the 30-day average at this time of the
day.  “Commodity prices are putting a little bit of pressure on
the markets today,” said John O’Connell, chief executive
officer with Davis Rea Ltd., which manages about C$600 million
($590 million) in Toronto.  Raw-materials stocks fell the most in the S&P/TSX, dropping
1.2 percent as a group. Gold futures for June delivery declined
0.5 percent to $1,598.70 an ounce as its attractiveness as a
safe haven waned. The metal headed for the second straight
quarterly loss, the longest slump since 2001.  Euro-area leaders agreed yesterday to a 10 billion-euro
($13 billion) bailout of Cyprus’s banking system, easing
concerns  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen. Orders for U.S.
durable goods climbed more than forecast in February, rising 5.7
percent. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of home prices gained  the
most since 2006.  Gold Producers  Yamana Gold lost 0.9 percent to C$15.26. and Goldcorp slid
0.9 percent to C$33.36. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest
gold producer, fell 1.2 percent to C$29.27. Founder and Co-
Chairman Peter Munk said yesterday he and his directors have
been considering “new leadership” for the board.  Turquoise Hill retreated 2 percent to C$6.33. The company,
which owns a 66 percent stake in the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold
mine project in Mongolia, reported a fourth-quarter adjusted
 loss  of 18 cents a share, compared with estimates of a loss of 5
cents, according to a survey of five analysts by Bloomberg.  Bank Surcharge  Royal Bank added 0.1 percent to C$61.24 and the Bank of
Nova Scotia rose 0.4 percent to C$59.69 even as  Canada ’s banking
regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions, said today the nation’s six largest banks will be
subject to a surcharge equal to 1 percent of risk weighted
capital by Jan. 1, 2016.  “Investors are giving banks the benefit of the doubt and
reasonably so,” O’Connell said. “It wasn’t a surprise. They’re
clearly in great shape, so nobody’s really worried about these
banks.”  Each bank will also have to hold debt that can be converted
to capital if it fails, reducing the need for a taxpayer-funded
bailout. Canadian banks have been ranked the world’s soundest
for the past five years by the World Economic Forum.  Just Energy Group Inc. rallied 10 percent to C$6.80 after
its executive chairman said the natural gas and power supplier
does not plan additional dividend cuts. The stock slid 14
percent over the previous four days.  “We recognize there are rumors in the market regarding a
further dividend reduction,” Rebecca MacDonald said in a
statement yesterday. “At this point we do not expect any
further changes to our dividend payout.”  The Toronto-based company cut its quarterly dividend to 7
Canadian cents a share from 10 cents a share on Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
