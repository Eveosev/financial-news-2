Mediaset SpA (MS)  shares rose the most
in a month after the broadcaster controlled by former Italian
Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  reported sales that beat
analysts’ estimates and said it was ahead of cost-cut targets.  Revenue fell 12 percent to 3.72 billion euros ($4.8
billion) in 2012, beating analysts’ average  estimate  of 3.59
billion euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Mediaset, based in Milan, said 2012 savings reached 307.2
million euros, exceeding its 250 million-euro goal.  The company, which has a plan to cut costs by 450 million
euros a year within three years, is also selling non-core assets
as advertising revenue in Italy has fallen. It reduced net debt
by 177.9 million euros to 1.71 billion euros in 2012.  “Mediaset has been able to reach and quickly beat its
cost-savings target, and debt reduction is a clear signal of the
company’s skill in generating cash,” Giasone Salati, an analyst
at Espirito Santo Investment Bank, said by phone. “I am also
positive about the recovery of  Italy ’s advertising market.”  Mediaset rose as much as 10 percent to 1.71 euros, the
biggest intraday increase since Feb. 25. The stock climbed 7.4
percent to 1.66 euros at 11:05 a.m. in Milan, taking its advance
to 6.9 percent this year.  The broadcaster had a net loss of 287.1 million euros in
2012, compared with a profit of 225 million euros a year
earlier. Mediaset had impairments and provisions, including on
the value of sports rights, of 307.8 million euros. The company
won’t pay a dividend for the first time in its history, Chief
Financial Officer Marco Giordani said on a conference call.  Advertising Slump  “Since the start of economic crisis Mediaset’s management
has moved quickly on cost cuts,”  Claudio Aspesi , an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a phone interview. “But the
problem of revenue growth remains unresolved because the
traditional advertising market continues to slump and the
company probably should diversify more on digital advertising.”  Mediaset’s total gross Italian ad sales, including domestic
unit Publitalia and Digitalia, fell 16 percent to 2.33 billion
euros in 2012.  Revenue at pay-TV offering Premium was in line with a year
earlier at 518 million euros.  The Italian advertising market plunged more than 16 percent
in January to 271.2 million euros, while Internet ads climbed
9.3 percent to 31 million euros, according to Nielsen.  Mediaset received bids for Italy’s Space Cinema chain of
theaters, jointly owned with an  investment company  linked to
Benetton Group SpA, people familiar with the matter said in
February. The asset is valued at 120 million euros to 140
million euros, one of the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
