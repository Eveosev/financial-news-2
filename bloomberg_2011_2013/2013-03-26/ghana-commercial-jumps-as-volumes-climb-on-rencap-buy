Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd. (GCB) , the
country’s biggest lender in terms of branches, rose the most in
more than a month in Accra after it was rated a buy by
Renaissance Capital.  Shares of the lender rallied 1.3 percent to 3.1 cedis by
the close of trading in Ghana’s capital, the steepest one-day
jump since Feb. 22. Trading volumes were more than 12 times the
daily average over the past three months.  Ghana Commercial was the only bank assigned a buy rating by
the Moscow-based investment bank, which has started coverage of
three lenders in the West African nation.  Ecobank Ghana Ltd. (EBG)  and
 Cal Bank Ltd. (CAL)  were rated hold, Renaissance analysts, Adesoji Solanke and Nothando Ndebele wrote in a note e-mailed yesterday.  “Ghana seems to have the opportunity to increase its
retail banking penetration, especially relative to countries in
southern and eastern Africa,” the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
