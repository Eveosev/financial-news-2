The  Denver Nuggets  had their 15-
game National Basketball Association winning streak stopped with
a 110-86 road loss to the  New Orleans Hornets .  Ryan Anderson scored 23 points for the Hornets, who hit 14-
of-25 3-point attempts and opened a 21-point halftime lead last
night in New Orleans.  Denver was held to 38 percent shooting and was outrebounded
45-32 in losing for the first time since Feb. 22 and falling to
49-23. The Nuggets’ 15 consecutive victories matched the longest
win streak in franchise history, set by the 1969-70 Denver
Rockets of the American Basketball Association.  New Orleans had seven players score at least 11 points and
jumped out to a 14-point first-quarter lead. The Hornets were up
59-38 at halftime and never led by fewer than 11 points during
the second half at New Orleans Arena.  The Nuggets’ loss came on a night the  Miami Heat  pushed
their winning streak to 27 games -- the second-longest run in
NBA history -- with a 108-94 victory over the Orlando Magic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
