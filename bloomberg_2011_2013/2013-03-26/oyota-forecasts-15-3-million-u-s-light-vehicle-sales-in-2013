     March 26 (Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. forecast total
industry sales for U.S. light vehicles of 15.3 million this
year, an increase of about 5.5 percent compared with 2012,
according to  Bob Carter , senior vice president of automotive
operations.  “We’re optimistic about 2013 because the U.S. economy is
forecast to continue improving,” helped by the job market,
 consumer confidence  and the recovery in the housing market,
Carter said in a statement on the company’s website.  “We
expect a lot of that growth to be in hybrids, small trucks and
retail sales,” he said, “We believe we’re poised for another
solid year.”  The Toyota City, Japan-based automaker company had
previously forecast total U.S. sales of 14.7 million for 2013,
compared with 14.5 million last year.  The company is “on track” to hit its target of combined
Toyota, Scion and Lexus sales to increase to more than 2.2
million vehicles, Carter also said in the statement, which is a
transcript of a speech to be given today in  New York .   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
