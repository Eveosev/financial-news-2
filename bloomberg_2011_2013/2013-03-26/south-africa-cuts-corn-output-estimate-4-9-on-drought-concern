South Africa , the continent’s
biggest corn producer, reduced its forecast for output of the
grain by 4.9 percent because of a lack of rain in some of the
main growing regions, the Crop Estimates Committee said.  The nation may reap 11.8 million metric tons of corn this
season, Marda Scheepers, spokeswoman for the committee, said by
phone from  Pretoria  today. That is more than the median estimate
of 11.6 million tons by seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey and
is lower than the 12.4 million-ton prediction made by the
committee last month.  “The expected size of the total crop has been decreased
mainly as a result of dry conditions in the Free State and North
West provinces, which had a negative impact on the expected
crop,” Scheepers said.  Some of South Africa’s main growing regions, including the
Free State, which produces 40 percent of the country’s corn,
haven’t received sufficient rain for crops to grow, which
analysts and traders from BVG (Pty) Ltd., Senwes Ltd. and
Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd. said will lead to lower-than-average
yields.  Prices for white corn, which is one of the nation’s staple
foods, have risen 4.2 percent over the past 12 months on the
South African Futures Exchange. The contact for July delivery of
the grain climbed 1 percent to 2,400 rand ($259) a ton, while
the yellow variety rose 1.1 percent to 2,333 rand a ton by noon
in Johannesburg.  The committee cut its forecast for white-corn output by 6.6
percent to 6.31 million tons, and lowered the estimate for
production of the yellow variety 2.9 percent to 5.44 million
tons.  It reduced the sunflower-output prediction by 11 percent
to 554,500 tons, and the cut soy-bean production estimate 6.9
percent to 851,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
