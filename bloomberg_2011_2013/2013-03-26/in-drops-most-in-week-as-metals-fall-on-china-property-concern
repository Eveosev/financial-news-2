Tin declined by the most in a week
as industrial metals fell on concern that further property curbs
in  China  may damp demand.  Tin for delivery in three months lost as much as 1.3
percent, the most since March 20, to $22,901 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange. It traded at $22,975 at 10:30 a.m.
Shanghai time. Nickel dropped 0.5 percent to $16,885 a ton and
lead slipped 0.2 percent to $2,176 a ton.  Some banks in China have started to control the scale of
loans for real estate development to coordinate with new
property curbs, the China Securities Journal reported today.
 Guangdong province  ordered the cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen
to set home price control targets for 2013 by the end of the
March. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index fell by as
much as 2 percent, the most since March 12.  “The slide in the stocks market affected the sentiment,
and pared the earlier gains in metals,” said Fang Junfeng, an
analyst at Shanghai Cifco Futures Co. “The biggest concern is
still China’s real estate sector, as that accounts for a big
proportion for metals consumption, and affects demand in other
industries as well.”  Hedge funds  are making the biggest bet against copper on
record, with speculators raising net-short positions in U.S.
copper futures and options by 53 percent to 25,719 contracts in
the week ended March 19, according to Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data that begins in 2006.  LME copper was little changed at $7,613.50 a ton. The metal
for July delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange declined 0.5
percent to 55,590  yuan  ($8,948) a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
