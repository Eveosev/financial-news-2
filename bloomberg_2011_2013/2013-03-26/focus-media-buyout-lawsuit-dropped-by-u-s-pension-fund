An investor in  Focus Media  Holding
Ltd. dropped a lawsuit seeking to block the Shanghai-based
advertising company’s $3.7 billion buyout by  Carlyle Group LP. (CG)   Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund ended the suit without
prejudice, meaning it can be refiled, according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in San Francisco. The pension fund
didn’t say why the complaint was dropped. A hearing on Focus
Media’s request to dismiss the case had been set for April 1.  Focus Media agreed Dec. 19 to be acquired by a group of
investors led by Carlyle in  China ’s biggest leveraged buyout.
The company operates networks of advertising display panels in
office buildings, supermarkets and other venues in China, and
began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2005. The
transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter,
Focus Media said in December.  The pension fund alleged that Focus Media’s board didn’t
conduct a full and fair sale process to get the best value for
shareholders.  The case is Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund v. Focus
Media Holding Limited, 13-00827, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of California ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
