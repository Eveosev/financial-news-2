Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) ’s Pakistan unit,
the nation’s biggest automobile assembler, plans to introduce a
new small car this year as it projects the highest profit in six
years, helped by the weaker yen.  The model will compete with other cars equipped with
engines sized 1 liter and below, said Abdul Hamid Bhombal, chief
financial officer of  Pak Suzuki Motor Co. (PSMC) , in an interview in
Karachi yesterday, without giving details. Bhombal estimates
profit to rise from last year, when  net income  rose 23 percent
to a five-year high of 978 million rupees ($10 million).  The new car targets buyers opting for cheaper, second-hand
imports such as Toyota Motor Corp.’s Vitz. Pakistan’s car sales
fell by a quarter to 73,502 units in the eight months ending
February, according to  Pakistan  Automotive Manufacturers
Association.  Pak Suzuki’s shares rose 0.9 percent to 99.10 rupees at
2:19 p.m. in Karachi, compared with a 0.6 percent drop in the
benchmark KSE-100 Index. The shares have gained 13 percent this
year, against a 5 percent increase in the KSE100 Index.  The yen, which reached a postwar high of 75.35 to the
dollar in 2011, traded at 94.06 per dollar as of 9:53 a.m. in
 Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
