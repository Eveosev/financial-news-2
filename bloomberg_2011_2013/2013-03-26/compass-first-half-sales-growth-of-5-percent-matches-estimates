Compass Group Plc (CPG) , the world’s
largest catering group, reported first-half revenue growth in
line with estimates as declining sales in  Europe  and Japan were
partly offset by increases in  emerging markets .  Organic revenue has risen almost 5 percent since Sept. 30,
the Chertsey, England-based company said today in a statement,
matching the median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . The company expects to report an increase in
operating profit margin of about 15 basis points for the same
period, Compass said.  Compass said it expects first-half revenue to decline 2.5
percent in Europe and Japan and this would be part offset by a
cost cutting and restructuring program. Business is “positive”
in  North America  and “strong” in fast growing and emerging
markets including Brazil and Turkey, where revenue for the half
year is expected to have grown by more than 10 percent, it said.  “We are not changing our forecasts today but do expect
consensus to be revised positively in light of the recent
currency movements,” analysts including Vicki Lee at Barclays
Plc in London, said in a note to clients.  Barclays will retain
its overweight recommendation, according to the note.  Compass will continue a 400 million-pound ($607.5 million)
share buyback program between April 1 and May 15, it said. The
shares were down 1.3 percent at 8:12 a.m. in London, paring
year-to-date gains of 15 percent. First-half earnings are
expected to be released on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
