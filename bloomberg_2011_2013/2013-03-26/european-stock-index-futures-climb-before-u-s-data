European (SXXP)  stocks advanced as better-
than-estimated U.S. durable-goods orders and housing data helped
offset concern euro-area lawmakers will impose losses on  bank
deposits  in the region.  William Morrison Supermarkets Plc and  Celesio AG (CLS1)  led a
gauge of retailers higher, each climbing more than 3 percent.
Kazakhmys Plc slumped to an almost four-year low as the copper
producer cut its dividend.  Telefonica SA (TEF)  dropped the most in
more than seven months after selling treasury stock.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.2 percent to 293.76 at
the close in London. The benchmark gauge is heading for a 10th
month of gains, its longest winning streak since July 1997,
after U.S. data beat forecasts and amid optimism central banks
will continue monetary stimulus.  “The  U.S. economy  is definitely gaining momentum.” said
 Michael Morris , who oversees about $1 billion as head of
European equities at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management in London.
“We’re getting into the next phase of the investment cycle. The
U.S. housing market bottomed a long time ago, and I don’t expect
it to deteriorate again. We are generally getting data which is
consistent with an economic recovery.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in seven of the 18
western European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index added
0.3 percent,  France ’s CAC 40 Index climbed 0.6 percent, while
 Germany ’s DAX increased 0.1 percent.  The Cyprus Stock Exchange remains closed for trading today
and tomorrow as banks are closed, according to a statement on
CSE’s  website .  U.S. Economy  U.S.  durable-goods orders  rose in February by the most in
five months, Commerce Department figures showed today. The 5.7
percent increase in bookings for goods meant to last at least
three years followed a revised 3.8 percent drop in January.
Economists had predicted 3.9 percent increase before the report.  A separate report showed the S&P/Case-Shiller index of
property values in 20 cities rose 8.1 percent in the 12 months
ended January, the biggest year-over-year gain since June 2006,
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey had called for a gain
of 7.9 percent.  Stocks earlier pared gains after Reuters reported that the
European Parliament will demand that depositors with more than
100,000 euros ($129,000) take losses. The  news agency  cited
Gunnar Hokmark, a lawmaker.  Retailers Rally  Morrison advanced 3.5 percent to 276 pence after Citigroup
Inc. upgraded the retailer to buy and lifted its price estimate
for the shares to 325 pence from 280 pence.  Celesio added 4 percent to 14.50 euros after the Germany
drug wholesaler said 2012 earnings exceeded its own target.  Bellway Plc rose 2.9 percent to 1,227 pence. The U.K.
housebuilder said net income increased 51 percent in the six
months ended Jan. 31 to 46 million pounds ($70 million) from a
year earlier.  SBM Offshore NV rallied 3.6 percent to 13.34 euros.
 Brazil ’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA awarded letters of intent for
the lease of two floating production, storage and offloading
units to the Dutch company. The projects will have a total value
of $3.5 billion and will be operated by SBM’s joint venture with
Queiroz Galvao Oleo e Gas SA and other partners.  EDF SA (EDF)  advanced 2.4 percent to 15.31 euros after Morgan
Stanley upgraded the shares to overweight, the equivalent of a
buy recommendation, from equal weight. The brokerage said the
shares are trading at a deep discount.  Kazakhmys declined 8.6 percent to 405.3 pence, the lowest
price since April 1, 2009 after Kazakhstan’s biggest copper
producer cut its 2012 dividend to 11 cents a share, down from 28
cents in 2011. The company posted a full-year loss after the
value of its 26 percent stake in Eurasian Natural Resources
Corp. dropped by more than half.  Telefonica dropped 5 percent to 10.68 euros as trading in
the shares opened late after being suspended for more than an
hour. The company raised 975 million euros in a sale of treasury
stock at 10.80 euros per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
