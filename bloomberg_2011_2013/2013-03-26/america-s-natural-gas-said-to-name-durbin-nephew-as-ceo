Marty Durbin, the nephew of Richard Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the U.S. Senate, is about
to take over as chief executive officer of  America’s Natural Gas
Alliance , according to a person familiar with the matter.  The Washington-based alliance, which represents independent
gas producers, will announce the choice tomorrow, the person
said. Durbin has been executive vice president of government
affairs for the American Petroleum Institute since December
2009. He’ll assume his new role on May 1, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the decision isn’t yet
public.  Durbin takes over from Regina Hopper, who announced last
month she was leaving the organization more than three years
after it was founded. Durbin, whose uncle is the senior senator
from Illinois, previously worked for the American Chemistry
Council and Democratic Representative Rick Boucher of Virginia,
according to his  LinkedIn profile .  America’s Natural Gas Alliance members are some of the
largest U.S. gas producers, including  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) ,
Devon Energy Corp.,  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) ’s XTO Energy subsidiary, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
