The Pittsburgh Steelers won’t re-
sign former Defensive Player of the Year  James Harrison , the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.  Harrison, a linebacker, was cut March 9 after he and the
team couldn’t agree on how much of a pay cut he would take from
his 2013 salary of $6.6 million, and the Steelers have since
 decided to move on , the newspaper said, citing a person it
didn’t identify.  The 34-year-old Harrison has played his entire 10-year
National Football League career in Pittsburgh, winning the 2008
Associated Press Defensive Player of the Year award. He was
named a first-team All-Pro that season and in 2010.  Harrison has 64 career sacks, with the six he had last
season while playing 13 games his fewest since becoming a full-
time starter in 2007.  Harrison traveled to Baltimore for a physical and meeting
with the Ravens yesterday but the interview was canceled after
the team signed former Denver Broncos defensive end Elvis Dumervil, the Post-Gazette said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
