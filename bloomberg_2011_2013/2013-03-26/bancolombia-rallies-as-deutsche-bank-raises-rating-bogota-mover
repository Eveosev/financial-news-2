Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) ,  Colombia ’s largest
bank, rose the most in a month as Deutsche Bank AG raised its
rating to hold, saying the company may seek to sell less than
the $2.3 billion in stock approved by shareholders.  Preferred shares climbed 0.9 percent to 28,740 pesos at
2:13 p.m. in Bogota after climbing as much as 2.1 percent in the
biggest intraday jump since Feb. 25.  Bancolombia has dropped 6.3 percent since agreeing on Feb.
19 to pay $2.1 billion for HSBC Holdings Plc’s Panama unit as
investors speculated the bank will sell shares to preserve its
 capital ratios . Shareholders voted on March 4 to allow the sale
of as many as 148.2 million preferred shares that may be issued
in multiple offerings. That was worth 4.3 trillion pesos ($2.3
billion) today.  “We expect the company to issue less than the entire
amount,” Tito Labarta and  Mario Pierry , analysts at Deutsche
Bank, wrote in a research note published yesterday.
Bancolombia’s American Depositary Receipts were raised to hold
from sell.  Bancolombia may rally 15 percent if no shares shares are
issued, according to the analysts, “which likely explains why
management may choose to delay the offering as long as
possible.” The stock may fall 8 percent if Bancolombia sold the
full amount, they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
