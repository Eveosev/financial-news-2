Poland is “unlikely” to cut
value-added taxes as planned next year because the economic
slowdown is curbing revenue, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.  “We would have to see a radical improvement in the second
half to reduce VAT,” he told reporters after a government
meeting in Warsaw today. “It looks unlikely to me.”  The government planned to reduce the standard VAT rate back
to 22 percent after raising it to 23 percent in 2011. Indirect
taxes including VAT and excise duty account for 64 percent of
budget revenue, according to this year’s plan.  Poland’s economy is facing its deepest slowdown in 12 years
as rising unemployment curbs consumer spending and reduces
inflows to state coffers. The  budget deficit  reached 61 percent
of this year’s target at the end of February as the tax take
declined.  Tusk’s comments come after Deputy Finance Minister Janusz Cichon said March 13 that the government still plans to reduce
VAT next year. Cichon’s remarks “were too optimistic
considering what’s going on with our finances,” the prime
minister said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
