Britain’s East Coast rail route
should be back in private hands within two years after the
government said it would invite bids tenders for a contract
that’s been run by a state-backed operator.  A competition for the line linking  London  with Edinburgh
will commence immediately, with the expectation that the new
franchisee will carry its first passenges in February, 2015, the
Department for Transport said in a statement today.  Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced the East
Coast plan as part of a revamp of U.K. rail bids over the next
eight years, including a mechanism for considering passenger
feedback when awarding contracts and the establishment of a
Franchise Advisory Panel. The tender system had ground to a halt
after complaints from Virgin Trains triggered a probe that found
it had been unfairly stripped of the West Coast route.  “In future franchise competitions we are placing
passengers in the driving seat by ensuring that their views and
satisfaction levels are taken into account when deciding which
companies run our railway services,” McLoughlin said today.  Under the new timetable, the West Coast and East Coast
contracts will be staggered so that they’re not up for tender at
the same point in the economic cycle, the DfT said.  Franchise extensions and directly awarded contracts will
also be used to realign the timetable, starting today with the
government serving notice on First Capital Connect and
Southeastern to call contractual six-month extensions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
