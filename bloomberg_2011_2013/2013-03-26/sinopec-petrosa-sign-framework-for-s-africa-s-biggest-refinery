China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) 
and PetroSA, South Africa’s state-owned oil company, signed a
framework agreement to build a crude refinery that’s set to be
the country’s biggest.  The companies agreed to include the Industrial Development
Corp., a Johannesburg-based state lender, into the next phase of
the $10 billion Mthombo refinery project in  Port Elizabeth  on
South Africa’s south coast, they said in a joint statement.The
framework agreement with Sinopec, as  Asia ’s biggest refiner is
known, is valid for two years.  The 400,000-barrel-a-day plant would almost double the
country’s current combined capacity of 497,000 barrels from four
refineries, according to data from the South African Petroleum
Association. PetroSA started studying Mthombo as diesel and
gasoline imports rose on the back of economic expansion, with
demand exceeding local refinery output for the first time in
2007.  “Sinopec and PetroSA will jointly explore other
cooperation opportunities in the hydrocarbon industry,” Sinopec
Group Chairman Fu Chengyu said in the statement.  The companies in May last year agreed on how they will make
the business case for the refinery. The framework signed today
creates opportunities for cooperation in oil and gas exploration
in  South Africa  and its surrounding countries, the companies
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
