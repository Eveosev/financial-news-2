China’s  stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index down the most in a week, on concern official
measures to rein in  home prices  will hurt corporate earnings.  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016)  sank the most in two weeks
after the China Securities Journal reported many banks have
started to control the scale of loans for property development.
Haitong Securities Co. sank 4.3 percent, leading declines among
brokerages.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (600188)  had its biggest slump since
June after a brokerage downgrade. Dongfeng Automobile Co. fell
1.3 percent after 2012 net income slumped.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 1.3 percent, the most
since March 18, to 2,297.67 at the close. It fell 0.1 percent
yesterday following a four-day, 3.9 percent rally that drove it
to a two-week high. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) , which tracks stocks in
 Shanghai  and Shenzhen, retreated 1.5 percent to 2,575.05.  Hong
Kong ’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index sank 0.3 percent.  “There’s concern property curbs may impact the economy and
investors started selling the bigger stocks like financials,”
said Cao Xuefeng, an analyst at Huaxi Securities Co. in Chengdu.
“This will be a short-term sell-off. Prices are still
reasonable so investors will be back.”  The Shanghai Composite has lost 5.6 percent from a Feb. 6
peak on concern the nation’s economic recovery is faltering.
Last week’s rally drove the gauge to its highest close since
March 6, bolstered by a March 21 purchasing managers index
showing manufacturing is likely to expand at a faster pace this
month. The economy is improving after a slowdown, Yale
University senior fellow  Stephen Roach  said in a Bloomberg
Television interview.  Bank Controls  The measure is valued at 9.4 times projected 12-month
earnings, compared with the seven-year average of 15.8,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge’s trading
volumes were 8.6 percent lower than the 30-day average, while
its 30-day  volatility  rose to 19.8 today, the highest level
since March 22, the data show.  A gauge of financial shares in the CSI 300 Index lost 2.4
percent, the most among 10 industry  groups . Minsheng Banking
sank 4.6 percent, the most since March 12, to 10.50  yuan .
Haitong Securities lost 4.3 percent to 10.75 yuan.  Many banks have started to control the scale of loans for
real estate development to coordinate with new property curbs,
the China Securities Journal reported today. The China Banking
Regulatory Commission is drafting guidelines on property loans
including development loans and mortgages, the Journal reported,
cited an unidentified person close to the regulator.  Yanzhou Coal  In a sign of further tightening of monetary supply, the
central bank conducted 32 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) of 28-day
repurchase operations today in which it drains funds from the
banking system, according to a trader at a primary dealer
required to bid at the auctions. The bank extracted 47 billion
yuan from the market last week.  Yanzhou Coal sank 5.2 percent to 17.54 yuan, the biggest
tumble since June 26. The stock was cut to sell from hold at UOB
Kay-Hian Ltd. yesterday even after the company reported higher-
than-estimated full-year profit.  The company’s “better-than-expected results in 2012 were
partly because of one-off tax breaks in  Australia ” that will
not be repeated this year,  Helen Lau , an analyst at UOB Kay-Hian
Ltd. in Hong Kong, said by phone today.  Dongfeng Auto retreated 1.3 percent to 2.95 yuan after
reporting a 95 percent slump in 2012 net income from a year
earlier. Some 64 percent of Shanghai Composite Index companies
posted annual profit that missed estimates, according to  data  on
171 earnings reports compiled by Bloomberg since Jan. 1.  ‘Quite Bad’  “The 2012 profit reports are quite bad,” Zhang Haidong,
an analyst at Tebon Securities Co., said by telephone from
Shanghai. “We think earnings bottomed in the third quarter,
meaning we could possibly see an improvement in first-quarter
net income.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., retreated 0.3 percent to
$36.82 in New York. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  fell 0.2
percent.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  and  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  sank
more than 9 percent, as the bankruptcy of Suntech Power Holdings
Co., once the world’s biggest solar-panel maker, stoked stock
volatility. Trading in  Ambow Education Holding Ltd. (AMBO)  was
suspended for a second day as a buyout offer for the education
provider was withdrawn.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
