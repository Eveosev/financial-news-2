Egyptian demonstrators gathered
outside the public prosecutor’s office to protest arrest orders
issued for five activists in connection with clashes between
supporters and opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood.  “Down with the rule of the guide,” they chanted outside
the building in Cairo. “Injustice has never succeeded in
changing ideas.” Some secularist and youth activists say
Mohammed Badie, the Brotherhood’s leader, who is known as the
General Guide, is running the country behind the scenes.  One of the five activists, Alaa Abdel-Fattah, has turned
himself in and prosecutors have begun investigating his alledged
role in the unrest, the state-run Ahram Gate said.  The arrest orders may heighten tensions and fuel the
polarization that is marring  Egypt ’s transition and hurting its
economy. President Mohamed Mursi, who was fielded by the
Brotherhood, said on March 24 that he may have to take
unspecified measures to “protect the nation.”  The public prosecutor yesterday ordered the arrest of the
five activists on accusations they incited violence during
clashes outside the Brotherhood’s headquarters in Cairo on March
22. The five were also banned from travel and other opposition
figures were summoned for questioning over the violence, which
left about 200 people injured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
