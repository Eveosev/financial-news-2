The number of people at the U.K.’s
Serious Fraud Office working on a criminal investigation into
manipulation of the  London  interbank offered rate has been
doubled to 60, the director of the agency,  David Green , said in
a speech today.  “There will be significant progress in that investigation
over the next quarter,” Green said of the Libor probe, which
has resulted in the arrest of a former Citigroup Inc. trader and
two men who worked at brokerage firm RP Martin Holdings Ltd.  The SFO’s criminal probe is focusing on British nationals
at British banks, Green said, noting “Libor begins with
London.”  “We are moving hard and fast” on the case, he said, when
asked how the agency was working with other authorities.  The agency has already received 3.5 million pounds ($5.3
million) in additional funding from the U.K. Treasury and “will
receive more than that in 2014,” Green said.  Five employees from the U.K. tax authority will also be
assigned to the SFO to work on the  Libor probe , while two more
from Britain’s finance regulator are already involved, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
