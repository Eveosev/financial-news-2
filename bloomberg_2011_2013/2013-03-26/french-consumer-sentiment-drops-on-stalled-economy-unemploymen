French  consumer confidence  dropped
in March as a stalled economy and rising unemployment
discouraged spending.  A household sentiment index dropped to 84 this month from
86 in February, national statistics office Insee said today in
an e-mailed statement. Economists expected a reading of 86,
according to the median of 16 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg.  The French economy has barely grown for about two years and
President  Francois Hollande  is struggling to revive growth and
contain unemployment, which has surged to a 13-year high in the
wake of  Europe ’s debt crisis. The labor ministry reports
February jobless claims later today.  Europe’s second largest economy will likely recover later
this year though the rebound will be “weak,” European Central
Bank board member Benoit Coeure said today on Europe 1 radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
