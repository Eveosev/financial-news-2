South African white-corn futures
rose to the highest level in more than three months on
speculation that the country’s Crop Estimates Committee will
lower its grain production outlook.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract,
increased 1.1 percent to 2,400 rand ($259) a metric ton, the
highest since Nov. 29, by the noon close in Johannesburg. The
yellow variety for delivery in the same month, gained 1.1
percent to 2,333 rand a ton, the highest since Dec. 5.  The nation will probably produce 6.5 percent less corn than
the 12.4 million tons predicted on Feb. 26, according to the
median estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
range was 10.9 million tons to 12.1 million tons.  “A lot of people are looking out for the crop estimates
report and they generally think it will be lower,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader at Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd., said by
phone. “My personal opinion is that it will be lowered and they
will keep lowering it gradually.”  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as  animal feed .  Wheat for May delivery rose 0.2 percent to 3,505.80 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
