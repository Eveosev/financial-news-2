Bellway Plc (BWY)  said first-half profit
rose 51 percent after the U.K. homebuilder sold more homes at
higher prices.  Net income for the six months ended Jan. 31 rose to 46
million pounds ($70 million), or 37.7 pence a share, from 30.4
million pounds, or 25.1 pence, a year earlier, the Newcastle,
England-based company said today in a statement. Revenue gained
about 10 percent to 502.5 million pounds  U.K. homebuilders are recovering from the housing crash
that began in 2007 by developing land bought at discount prices.
The British government has put home construction at the center
of its strategy to revive the economy. Last week it announced a
plan to guarantee 130 billion pounds of new mortgages and
pledged to help new-home buyers with loans of as much as 20
percent of the property’s value.  “We do see opportunities in the new government shared-
equity scheme,” Finance Director Keith Adey said in a telephone
interview. “If the scheme works as we expect, it will free up
our balance sheet and allow us to increase volumes.”  Bellway was up 2.9 percent at 1,227 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London , giving the company a market value of 1.49
billion pounds. The shares have climbed 34 percent in the past
six months, while the Bloomberg EMEA Home Builders Index has
risen 37 percent.  Bellway sold 2,597 homes in the first half of its fiscal
year, 5.8 percent more than a year earlier, according to the
statement. The average selling price increased 2.6 percent to
187,426 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
