Regions Financial Corp. (RF) , Alabama’s
biggest bank, gave Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall a $1.44
million cash bonus for last year as the lender repaid its
government bailout.  Hall’s total compensation in 2012 was $11.9 million,  which
includes some pay from previous years, according to a filing
today by the Birmingham-based lender. That’s an 86 percent
increase over 2011, when he didn’t receive a bonus, according to
the filing.  The Troubled Asset Relief Program prohibited awarding
short- or long-term cash compensation based on performance.
Regions last year raised $900 million through a share sale to
repay $3.5 billion in taxpayer funds received in 2008. The bank
 posted a profit  in 2012 after reporting net losses in the
previous four years. Its shares gained 66 percent last year.  Chief Financial Officer  David Turner  received a cash bonus
of $640,705, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
