Cricket Australia  said national
team captain  Michael Clarke  will spend as long as 10 weeks away
from training and playing in order to recover from back and
hamstring injuries.  Clarke, 31, withdrew from the final match of Australia’s
4-0 Test series sweep of losses in  India  last weekend and flew
home to assess the extent of the injuries, which the Melbourne-
based governing body said aren’t new and will sideline him for
7-10 weeks.  “Michael Clarke had scans that confirmed his current lower
back injury is an exacerbation of previous issues he has had
with his spine,” Cricket Australia’s Chief Medical Officer
Justin Paoloni said in a statement. “He also has a hamstring
injury that has been a concern for most of the summer and will
complicate his return.”  The injuries will force Clarke to miss the Indian Premier
League Twenty20 competition, where he was set to play for the
Pune Warriors. A 10-week absence would see him return at the
start of June, with the first Ashes Test against  England 
scheduled to begin July 10.  “We are confident that it will not affect his Ashes
preparation but will know more over the coming weeks,” Paoloni
added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
