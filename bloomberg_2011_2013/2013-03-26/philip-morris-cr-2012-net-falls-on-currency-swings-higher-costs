Philip Morris CR (TABAK) , the Czech unit of
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, said full-
year profit fell on currency swings, higher costs and a move by
consumers to cheaper brands.  Net income for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 fell to to 2.4
billion koruna ($119 million) from 2.5 billion koruna a year
earlier, the Kutna Hora, Czech Republic-based company said in an
annual report today on its website. Total revenue excluding
excise tax and VAT rose 6.6 percent to 12.96 billion koruna.  Philip Morris’s board proposed a full-year gross dividend
of 900 koruna a share from 2012 profit and retained earnings
from previous years, compared with a 920 koruna per share payout
on 2011 income, the company said in a separate statement.  “Overall we see financial result slightly positive mainly
due to higher than estimated dividend at 900 koruna per share,”
Erste Group Research analyst Josef Novotny wrote in a note to
investors. Erste forecast a dividend of 836 koruna.  Despite of an improvement in revenue due to exports to
other Philip Morris units, the local market remains “under
pressure” as consumers in both countries move to cheaper brands
or flake tobacco with lower taxation, Chief Executive Officer
Andras Tovisi said in a statement.  Profit from operations fell 3.4 percent from a year earlier
to 3 billion koruna, primarily reflecting an “unfavorable”
volume and mix in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, higher costs
and expenses linked to currency swings worth 30 million koruna,
according to the statement. The decline was partially offset by
“favorable” pricing in both markets and higher exports to
affiliates, it said.  Philip Morris’s market share fell 1.2 percentage points to
50.7 percent in 2012 in the Czech Republic. In Slovakia, the
measure rose 0.9 percentage point to 50.9 percent in 2012, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
