Spot gasoline weakened in New York
Harbor after  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s Monroe Energy LLC subsidiary
was said to be restoring a fluid catalytic cracker at the
Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery.  A unit that shut down yesterday after a power failure was
restarting, a person with direct knowledge of the plant’s
operations said. The person asked not to be identified because
the information isn’t public.  The  185,000-barrel-a-day Trainer refinery  has a catalytic
cracking capacity of 53,000 barrels a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. An FCC upgrades vacuum gasoil into
lighter petroleum products, including gasoline and jet fuel.  The discount for  reformulated , 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in New York Harbor slipped 0.25 cent to  19.25 cents  a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at
2:16 p.m. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel declined 1.25 cents to a
premium of 11.5 cents against heating oil futures, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline supplies  in the region, known as PADD 1B, climbed
to 33.7 million barrels in the week ended March 15, while
distillate stockpiles fell to  19.1 million barrels , Energy
Information Administration data showed last week.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York Harbor, a measure of
refining profitability for gasoline and diesel based on Brent
oil in Europe, fell for a fourth day, slipping $1.25 to $13.23 a
barrel, the lowest level since March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
