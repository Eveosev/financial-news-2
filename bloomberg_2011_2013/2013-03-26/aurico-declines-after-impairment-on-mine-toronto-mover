AuRico Gold Inc. (AUQ) , which operates
mines in  Mexico  and  Canada , fell the most in six months after
the company took a writedown on its El Chanate operation and
fourth-quarter revenue missed analysts’ estimates.  AuRico declined 5.3 percent to C$6.40 at 10:46 a.m. in
Toronto, where the company is based. The shares earlier fell 6.4
percent, the most intraday since Sept. 5.  The company had a net loss of $25.4 million, or 9 cents a
share, compared with profit of $77.9 million, or 31 cents, a
year earlier, it said in a statement yesterday. Earnings
included a $127 million goodwill charge related to the El
Chanate mine in Mexico. Fourth-quarter revenue of $63.1 million
was lower than the $71.3 million average of three  analysts’
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The impairment on El Chanate “had not been previously
communicated,” Steven Green, a Toronto-based analyst at TD
Securities Inc, said in a note today. “The writedown is
consistent with our view however that El Chanate generates very
little free cash flow at these gold prices given the very high
sustaining capital.”  AuRico will pay its first quarterly  dividend  of 4 cents a
share on April 18, the company said yesterday. It completed a
$300 million share buyback in January after selling Mexican
assets to billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s Minera Frisco SAB in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
