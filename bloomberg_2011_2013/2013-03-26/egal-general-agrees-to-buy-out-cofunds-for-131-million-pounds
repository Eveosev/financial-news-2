Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN) , the
largest manager of U.K. pension assets, agreed to buy out the 75
percent of Cofunds Holdings Ltd. it doesn’t already own for 131
million pounds ($199 million) in cash to bolster its electronic
platforms.  The transaction values Cofunds, which provides technology
allowing sales advisers and financial firms to get information
about products electronically, at 175 million pounds, London-
based Legal & General said in a statement today. Cofunds is the
U.K.’s largest investment platform for financial services and
has over 50 billion pounds of assets under administration.  “Digital solutions is one of our five drivers of growth,”
said Mark Gregory, chief executive officer of savings at Legal &
General. “The projected growth in the investment platform
market is substantial and we expect Cofunds to be a major
beneficiary of this growth.”  Legal & General said earlier this month it would seek
acquisitions this year in its existing areas of expertise. It
entered a joint-venture on March 18 to acquire Scottish housing
developer Cala Group Ltd. from  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  for 210
million pounds. The insurer on March 6 also raised its dividend
20 percent after sales,  cash flow  and operating profit increased
on demand for retirement products.  The Cofunds purchase is subject to regulatory approval and
is likely to be completed in the first half of 2013, Legal &
General said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
