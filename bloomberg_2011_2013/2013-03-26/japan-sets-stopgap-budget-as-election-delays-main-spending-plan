Japan ’s Cabinet today approved an
interim budget worth 13.2 trillion yen ($140 billion) for next
fiscal year after the main budget was delayed by the election
which bought Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to power.  The budget will cover spending for 50 days from the April 1
start of the new fiscal year, the  Finance Ministry  said in a
statement. Abe formed his government on Dec. 26, the date when
the finance ministry usually finishes compiling the next fiscal
year’s annual budget.  The budget will include 1.5 trillion yen of funding for
public works projects, pension payments and subsidies to local
governments, according to the statement. Abe plans to boost
public work spending by 16 percent next fiscal year to spur
economic growth.  The interim budget will merge with the annual budget after
parliament passes the regular spending plan for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
