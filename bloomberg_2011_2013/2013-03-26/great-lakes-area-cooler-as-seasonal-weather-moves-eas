The Great Lakes and northern Great
Plains regions are expected to remain cooler than normal while
seasonal temperatures dominate most of the U.S. through the
first week in April, said Matt Rogers, president of Commodity
Weather Group LLC.  Temperatures will probably be 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7
Celsius) below normal from  Alberta  through western New York,
Rogers, based in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in his 11- to 15-day
forecast for April 4 through April 8.  An area from southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba to northern
Illinois and  Iowa  may be 5 degrees cooler than usual, Rogers
said. The Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains region may
be 3 degrees warmer during the period.  “The 11-15 day continues to suffer from more variability,
which reduces model skill, but the bulk of the better-performing
guidance continues to favor a seasonal cool pattern situation
for especially the Midwest and East in the second week of
April,” Rogers wrote in a note to clients.  The heating season ends with March. April is the start of a
transition to warmer temperatures, when more energy is used to
cool rather than heat homes. Extended cold in the large
population centers of the Midwest and East helps boost prices
for heating fuels. About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas
for warmth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
