Gold was little changed after
dropping to a one-week low as investors weighed concern that
Cyprus’s bank-restructuring plan may be used as a template for
other European nations, potentially increasing haven demand.  Gold for immediate delivery was at $1,604.10 an ounce at
9:17 a.m. in  Singapore  from $1,605.09. Prices fell to $1,589.87
yesterday, the lowest since March 15, after Cyprus agreed to a
bailout that averted default. Platinum fell 0.3 percent to
$1,581.50 an ounce even as holdings in exchange-traded products
gained to an all-time high of 52.144 metric tons.  The bailout will see Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl wound down,
wiping out bondholders, and will impose losses on some
depositors at Bank of Cyprus Plc. Gold has climbed 1.6 percent
this month, set for the first monthly gain since September, on
concern the situation in Cyprus may reignite the debt crisis.  “The market isn’t done with trying to buy gold,” said
 Jonathan Barratt , chief executive officer of Barratt’s Bulletin,
a commodity newsletter in Sydney. “This isn’t solved.”  Gold for June delivery was little changed at $1,604.80 an
ounce on the Comex in  New York . Holdings in bullion-backed ETPs
expanded for a third day to 2,454.863 tons yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spot silver was little changed at $28.835 an ounce, while
palladium was at $757.05 an ounce from $757.50 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
