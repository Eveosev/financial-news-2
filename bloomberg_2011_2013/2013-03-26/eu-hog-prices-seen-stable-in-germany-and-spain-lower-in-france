Pig prices were stable in  Germany 
and Spain, the European Union’s biggest pork producers, while
falling in France, industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V. reported.  Hog prices in Germany were at 1.626 euros ($2.09) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) for a fifth week, while in Spain prices
remained at 1.818 euros, Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in an
online  report  today.  Pork accounts for about half of meat consumption in the EU.
Average consumption of pork in the 27-nation bloc is forecast to
fall to 40.1 kilograms per person this year from 40.5 kilograms
in 2012, the EU reported this month.  “The hoped-for strong upswing in demand before Easter
largely remained absent,” ISN wrote. “Most quotes remain at
the level already reached. If after Easter temperatures finally
start rising, the first grilling activity should again stimulate
price fantasies.”  In  France , the EU’s third-biggest pig producer, prices
slipped to 1.678 euros a kilogram from 1.696 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
