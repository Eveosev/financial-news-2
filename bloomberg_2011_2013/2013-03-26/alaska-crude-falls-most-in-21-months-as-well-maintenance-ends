Alaska  North Slope crude on the
spot market weakened the most since June 2011 as maintenance on
production wells ended and work on refineries began and as the
spread between global and U.S. oil prices narrowed.  Output in Alaska’s Endicott field has averaged 10,039
barrels a day since March 19 after averaging 6,025 barrels a day
prior to that this month, the state tax division said on its
website today.  BP Plc (BP/)  was expected to wrap up maintenance on
wells in the field this month, Dawn Patience, a BP spokeswoman,
said Feb. 28.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  shut units March 8 at its Anacortes refinery
in  Washington , according to a filing with the Northwest Clean
Air Agency. The plant was scheduled to shut a fluid catalytic
cracker and other units for repairs this quarter. The 125,000-
barrel-a-day refinery receives crude from Alaska by tanker,
according to Tesoro’s website.  Alaskan crude competes for space in U.S. West Coast
refineries with foreign oils priced against Brent, the
international marker. Brent’s premium over West Texas
Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, narrowed 34 cents to
$13.02 a barrel, the smallest gap since July.  ANS fell $4.10, or 24 percent, to a premium of $12.80 a
barrel above WTI on the spot market in Cushing, Oklahoma, at
2:10 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s the lowest premium since Jan. 25, 2012, and the
largest percentage drop since June 24, 2011.  Western Canada Select, a blend of heavy Alberta crudes,
narrowed its discount to WTI by $1.65 to $14.75 a barrel,
according to Calgary oil broker  Net Energy Inc.   To contact the reporter on this story:
