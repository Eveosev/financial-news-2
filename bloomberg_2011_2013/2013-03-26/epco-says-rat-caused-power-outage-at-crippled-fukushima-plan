Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  said a
blackout at its crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant last
week was caused by a rat.  Tepco, as the company is known, concluded the 15-centimeter
rat short-circuited a switchboard at the plant in Fukushima
prefecture after finding the dead animal near the equipment last
week, spokesman Yusuke Kunikage said by phone today. The rodent
had a scar that looked to have been caused by an electric shock.
The company is considering measures to prevent a recurrence of
the accident, he said.  The Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, crippled after a massive
earthquake and tsunami in 2011, lost power to its cooling
systems for storage pools for used nuclear fuel rods on March
18. Power was mostly restored the next day before the spent fuel
rods started overheating, according to Tepco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
