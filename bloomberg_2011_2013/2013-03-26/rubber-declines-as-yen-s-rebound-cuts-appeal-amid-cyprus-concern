Rubber fell as  Japan ’s currency
gained, cutting the appeal of yen-denominated contracts, amid
concern Cyprus’s bank-restructuring plan will be a template for
other European nations, imperiling bondholders and depositors.  The contract for delivery in August lost as much as 1.4
percent to 275.6 yen a kilogram ($2,920 a metric ton) and was at
277.7 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:17 a.m. Futures
extended this year’s retreat to 8.3 percent.  The yen traded at 94.28 per dollar after climbing yesterday
to 93.53, the highest level since March 6. Investor demand for
the haven currency increased amid concern the restructuring plan
for Cyprus will set a precedent for losses on deposits in other
European countries.  “The market retreated as concerns grew that the Cyprus
bailout agreement would impact on other European nations,”
Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo,
said today by phone.  The island nation’s rescue sets precedents for the  euro
zone  that may stick in the memory of depositors and bondholders
alike as investors debate who will next fall victim to the debt
crisis. Under the terms of the agreement struck yesterday in
Brussels, senior Cypriot bank bond holders will take losses and
uninsured depositors will be largely wiped out.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.3 percent to 22,840  yuan  ($3,678) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board rose 0.4 percent to 86.50 baht ($2.95) a
kilogram yesterday, the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand 
said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
