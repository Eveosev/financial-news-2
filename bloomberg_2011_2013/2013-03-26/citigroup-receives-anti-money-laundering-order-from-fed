Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. lender, must submit plans to the  Federal Reserve  that show
how the bank has improved safeguards against money laundering.  Regulators ordered the New York-based company to explain
procedures put in place to improve compliance with the Bank
Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering regulations, the Fed said
today in a consent order.  The bank failed to conduct proper due diligence on
customers and was too slow to file so-called suspicious activity
reports, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said
in April. The deficiencies prevented Citigroup from identifying
risky customers and monitoring client relationships, the
regulator said.  “Citigroup lacked effective systems of governance and
internal controls to adequately oversee the activities” of two
of its subsidiaries with respect to anti- money laundering ,
according to the Fed’s order.  The Fed said it acted after regulators including the OCC
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. filed orders against
bank subsidiaries Citibank NA and Banamex USA because of
deficiencies in their oversight.  The Bank Secrecy Act requires banks to report all large
cash deposits to help prevent crimes such as drug trafficking
and terrorist financing.  For Related News and Information:
