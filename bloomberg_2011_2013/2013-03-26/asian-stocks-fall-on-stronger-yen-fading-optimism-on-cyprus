Most Asian  stocks  dropped on
concern Cyprus’s bank-restructuring plan will be used for other
European nations, imperiling depositors and bondholders, and on
a report  China  is stepping up property curbs.  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. (4902) , a lensmaker that gets 28
percent of sales from Europe, sank 6 percent in  Tokyo . Country
Garden Holdings Co., the Chinese developer controlled by
billionaire Yang Huiyan, fell 1.7 percent on a report that banks
have started to control the scale of loans for mainland real
estate developments. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rallied, led by
exporters, in the final hour of trading as European stocks
opened higher.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed 135.55 as of
7:08 p.m. in Tokyo, with five companies falling for every four
that rose. Japanese shares pared losses earlier as new  Bank of
Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he’ll consider extending
bond maturities.  “Cyprus doesn’t help in the sense that reminds us the EU
leadership is basically improvising from solution to solution,”
said Mikio Kumada, a Hong Kong-based global strategist for LGT
Capital Management, which oversees more than $25 billion. “The
Chinese government doesn’t have a lot of room to relax because
if it does now, it will just create a bigger mess for itself.
It’s stuck in that sense.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 4.9 percent this year
through yesterday on improving economic data from the U.S. and
speculation that  Japan  will deploy more stimulus.  The Asian benchmark traded at 15 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 14 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 12.6 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  BOJ Governor  Japan’s Topix Index slid 0.3 percent, paring declines as
Kuroda told lawmakers he’ll consider buying more  government
bonds  with longer maturities and vowed to consider scrapping a
self-imposed rule limiting the scale of asset buying. The Nikkei
225 Stock Average slipped 0.6 percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.8 percent. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index dropped 1.3 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
rose 0.3 percent, erasing earlier losses of as much 0.7 percent.  South Korea’s Kospi Index advanced 0.3 as data showed the
nation’s economy expanded less than previously estimated in the
fourth quarter, underscoring the case for stimulus by the new
government. Singapore’s Straits Times Index gained 0.6 percent,
the most since March 6.  Asian shares rose yesterday as Cyprus, the euro-area’s
third-smallest economy, agreed the terms for a 10 billion-euro
($13 billion) bailout. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades
agreed to shut the country’s second-largest bank, and will tax
deposits of more than 100,000 euros.  Cyprus Bailout  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  rose 0.3 percent today. The index
fell 0.3 percent in New York yesterday, reversing earlier gains,
as Reuters reported that Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said the Cyprus bailout should be viewed as a
template for solving banking problems in the euro region.  “Equity markets have had a very strong run, reflecting the
improved economic conditions and earnings, but those gains will
need to be consolidated,” said Prasad Patkar, portfolio manager
who helps manage about $1 billion at Platypus Asset Management
Ltd. in Sydney. “Cyprus was the catalyst for that consolidation
to commence.”  Companies that do business in Europe fell,  Konica Minolta 
sank 6 percent 705 yen in Tokyo.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese exporter
of consumer electronics that gets a fifth of its revenue in
Europe, dropped 2.7 percent to 1,666 yen.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) ,

HK$8.59, the most since October 2008 and the biggest decline on
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The unit of Taiwan’s largest food
processor reported a fiscal-year net profit of 856 million  yuan 
($138 million), compared with an estimate of 903 million yuan
profit.  Exporters Rally  Exporters to the U.S. advanced ahead of a report that’s
expected to show orders for durable goods rebounded last month.
 Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the supplier of toys and clothes to retailers
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., rose 1.3 percent to HK$10.94 in
