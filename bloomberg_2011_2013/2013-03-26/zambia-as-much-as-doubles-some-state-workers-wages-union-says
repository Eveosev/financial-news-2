Government workers in Zambia,
 Africa ’s biggest copper producer, will see their salaries rise
by as much as 100 percent, according to an employees’ union.  While the raises range from 4 percent to 100 percent, most
will get increases of 40 percent to 50 percent, Leonard
Hikaumba, president of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions, said
by mobile phone from Lusaka, the capital, today.  “Those who were at the top were given low increments to
cater for these ones who were very low,” he said. ZCTU
represents almost half of the about 120,000 government workers,
according to Hikaumba. “Those who got 100 percent and above
were mainly” so-called general workers, he said. “Their
salaries were very, very low.”  Chileshe Kandeta, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry,
didn’t answer his mobile phone after normal business hours.  The state is one of the biggest employers in  Zambia , with
workers including nurses, police officers and teachers. World
Bank data shows 61 percent of the population lives below the
poverty line.  Inflation slowed for a second month in January to 6.9
percent as prices for corn, the staple food, eased. The local
currency, the kwacha, eased 0.8 percent to 5.4150 per dollar by
7:59 p.m. in Lusaka, bringing its loss this year to 4.3 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
