The Australian dollar traded 0.1
percent from its highest in two months as traders pared bets on
further interest rates cuts by the  Reserve Bank  and Governor
 Glenn Stevens  didn’t address monetary policy in comments today.  The so-called Aussie climbed against 15 of 16 major peers
this month as swaps indicated a 14 percent probability that the
nation’s 3 percent benchmark will be lowered when policy makers
meet April 2, Bloomberg data show. New Zealand’s kiwi dollar was
0.3 percent from a one-month high as the nation reported an
unexpected  trade surplus  for February.  “Markets aren’t seeing any easing from the RBA next month
so that is a factor supporting the currency,” said Matt Cramer,
senior foreign-exchange manager in Sydney at Velocity Trade Ltd.
“There’s been consistent buying of the Aussie and the Stevens
speech had very little implications for the currency.”  The Australian dollar was at $1.0466 as of 5:18 p.m. in
Sydney after yesterday reaching as high as $1.0480, the
strongest since Jan. 24. It was unchanged at 98.56 yen.  New
Zealand ’s currency was little changed at 83.54 U.S. cents and
yesterday touched 83.71, the most since Feb. 25. The kiwi was at
78.67 yen.  The RBA’s Australian dollar  trade-weighted index  rose 0.1
to 79.3 today, matching the level reached in March 2012, which
was the highest since 1985.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks fell 0.2 percent.  Rates Prospects  Traders are predicting the RBA will lower its benchmark
rate by 15 basis points over the next 12 months, down from
estimates for 46 basis points of cuts on March 1, according to a
Credit Suisse Group AG  index .  Governor Stevens  said today that a reconstructed bailout
deal for Cyprus was better than the initial proposal and
European authorities are likely to remain “case specific” in
their response to crisis. He didn’t comment on monetary policy
and declined to answer a question on fiscal policy.  New Zealand’s statistics bureau reported a trade surplus of
NZ$414 million ($346 million) in February, compared with the
median estimate for a NZ$12 million deficit in a Bloomberg poll.
The 12-month  trade gap  was NZ$1.08 billion, the data showed.  Australia ’s 10-year  bond yield  fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 3.58 percent. New Zealand’s two-year
 swap rate , a fixed payment made to receive floating rates which
is sensitive to interest-rate expectations rose to 2.92 percent
from 2.90 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
