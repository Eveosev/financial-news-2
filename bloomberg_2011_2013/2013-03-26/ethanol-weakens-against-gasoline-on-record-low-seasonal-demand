Ethanol weakened against gasoline
on speculation that record low seasonal production has balanced
supply and demand for the biofuel.  The spread expanded 5.1 cents to 57.36 cents a gallon, the
widest in two weeks. The Energy Information Administration said
last week that ethanol  stockpiles  are at the lowest level in
almost four months while gasoline demand is the weakest since
Jan. 11, shrinking the potential pool of the motor fuel with
which ethanol can be blended.  “It sure has gone quiet, hasn’t it?” said Mike Blackford,
a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “We’re
basically somewhat balanced.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 0.3 cent to
$2.537 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Prices have risen
16 percent this year.  April-delivery gasoline gained 4.8 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $3.1106 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  has been tempered by difficulty in
getting corn after the worst drought since the Dust Bowl era of
the 1930s slashed yields, Blackford said.  Corn for May delivery fell 3 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$7.3025 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
14 cents a gallon, compared to minus 15 cents yesterday. The
spread was more than twice that at the beginning of the year.  The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Output has dropped 16 percent from the record 963,000
barrels a day in December 2011 and stockpiles have fallen for a
record seven consecutive weeks, according to data from the
Energy Department’s analytical arm.  Blackford said ethanol prices have been capped by
lackluster gasoline demand.  Consumption of the motor fuel in the week ended March 15
slid 3.5 percent to 8.3 million barrels a day, the lowest amount
since Jan. 11, EIA data show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up a record 95 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, the report showed.  Imports Up  “There was a trickle of imports that showed up in the
report,” Blackford said.  Ethanol  imports  averaged 27,000 barrels a day in the week
ended March 15, the first time the U.S. has made foreign
purchases of the fuel since Feb. 22, EIA said.  Competition from imports may be limited as  Brazil , the
largest supplier of the fuel to the U.S., begins its sugarcane
harvest, Blackford said.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  fetched $2.28 a gallon in the
week ended March 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York slipped 1 cent
to $2.65 a gallon; in Chicago the additive rose 1 cent to $2.55;
in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel climbed 1 cent to $2.61; and on the
West Coast the renewable fuel lost 2.5 cents to $2.775,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf narrowed to
16.5 cents, the lowest level in a week, while Chicago’s discount
to  New York  Harbor contracted to 10 cents, the narrowest gap
since March 13.  Each gallon of biofuel introduced to the market is assigned
a Renewable Identification Numbers, which is submitted by
refiners to the Environmental Protection Agency to show
compliance with the law or traded.  The value of  corn-based RINs  jumped 9.9 percent to 66.5
cents, while the worth of advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian  sugarcane-based ethanol , gained 2.7 percent to 75
cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Certificates for both grades of RINs rose to records on
March 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
