(Corrects amount in headline.)  Otsuka Holdings Co. (4578)  agreed to pay
 H. Lundbeck A/S (LUN)  as much as $825 million to develop an
experimental Alzheimer’s treatment.  Otsuka will pay its Danish partner $150 million when the
deal is signed, and as much as $675 million if Lundbeck meets
regulatory and sales goals, the companies said in a statement
today. In return, Tokyo-based Otsuka will get rights to the
medicine in the U.S., Canada, east  Asia  including Japan, major
European countries and the Nordic region, they said.  A late-stage trial of the drug, known as Lu AE58054, will
start this year and involve more than 2,500 patients, the
companies said. Results from a mid-stage study will be presented
at a medical meeting in  Boston  in July, they said. The
drugmakers will share sales, development and marketing costs,
Otsuka and Copenhagen-based Lundbeck said.  Lu AE58054 targets 5-HT6 receptors in the areas of the
brain associated with cognition, resulting in increased
concentrations of acetylcholine and glutamate, chemicals that
aid learning and memory processes. About 18 million people
worldwide have Alzheimer’s disease, and the population may
almost double to 34 million by 2025, according to the Geneva-
based  World Health Organization .  Lundbeck raised its sales forecast for 2013 as a result of
the deal, and said today that it now expects revenue in a range
of 14.4 billion kroner ($2.5 billion) to 15 billion kroner.
Earnings before interest and taxes will total 1.9 billion kroner
to 2.4 billion kroner this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
