SinoTech Energy Ltd., a Beijing-
based oilfield equipment supplier, agreed to pay $20 million to
settle a lawsuit claiming the company misled investors in its
2010 initial public offering.  A group of investors, led by Zech Capital LLC, agreed to
the settlement with SinoTech and with  UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
Lazard Capital Markets LLC, the underwriters of the IPO. U.S.
District Judge Alison Nathan in  Manhattan  must approve the
settlement, which was filed with the court yesterday.  Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP, which was also named as a
defendant, isn’t part of the agreement.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year sued
SinoTech; Qingzeng Liu, the company’s chairman and controlling
shareholder; Chief Executive Officer Guoqiang Xin; and Boxun Zhang, a former chief financial officer, claiming they committed
 securities fraud . SinoTech lied about how much of the IPO
proceeds it spent on drilling equipment, according to the SEC.
The regulator also claimed Liu stole $40 million from the
company’s bank account.  SinoTech, Liu and Xin have settled the SEC claims,
according to court records. Zhang remains a defendant.  SinoTech  plunged  42 percent to $2.35 on the  Nasdaq  Stock
Market on Aug. 16, 2011, after Alfredlittle.com published a
short-seller’s note saying the company’s largest customers were
probably “nothing more than empty shells” and that it was
worth less than 63 cents a share. SinoTech called the note
“inaccurate and defamatory.”  Nasdaq delisted SinoTech in January 2012.  The case is Athale v. SinoTech Energy Ltd., 11-CV-5831,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
The SEC case is SEC v. Sinotech Energy Ltd., 12-cv-00960, U.S.
District Court, Western District of  Louisiana  (Lake Charles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
