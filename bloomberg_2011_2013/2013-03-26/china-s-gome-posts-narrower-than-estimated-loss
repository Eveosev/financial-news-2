Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd. (493) ,  China ’s second-largest electronics retailer, posted a
narrower-than-estimated loss last year as it shuttered some of
its less profitable stores and curbed expenses.  The company had a net loss of 596.6 million  yuan  ($96
million) in 2012, compared with a profit of 1.84 billion yuan a
year earlier, it said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock
exchange yesterday. That was smaller than the 616.3 million yuan
 average  loss estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .
Gome had warned of the loss in a Jan. 28 statement to the
exchange.  The Beijing-based retailer is adding more higher margin
products and upgrading its main stores as it seeks to revive
results. It returned to profitability in the fourth quarter with
earnings of 90 million yuan, according to a powerpoint
presentation at the company’s earnings press conference.  “The worst is over for the company,” President Wang Jun
Zhou said at a press conference. “This year, we will see the
results of changing our product mix and our cost control
measures coming further through.”  Its shares rose 2.3 percent to close at 89 Hong Kong cents
in Hong Kong trading today.  The company  along with larger rival  Suning Commerce Group
Co. (002024)  is expanding into e-commerce as more Chinese buyers increase
their purchases online. China’s online-retail transactions are
projected to more than double to 2.57 trillion yuan between 2012
to 2015, according to researcher Analysys International. Gome
also faced a weaker Chinese economy and price wars with Nanjing-
based Suning and 360buy Jingdong Inc. last year. Sales fell 20
percent to 47.9 billion yuan.  Gome and Suning, China’s largest electronics retailer, were
hurt by intense competition after online retailer 360buy
triggered a price war in August. Suning and Gome pledged to cut
prices after Liu Qiangdong, chairman of 360buy, announced that
all major appliances on its website would be at least 10 percent
cheaper than those sold by the store operators.  The company didn’t meet a target for 6 billion yuan in e-
commerce sales in 2012, Chief Financial Officer Fang Wei said.  A slowdown in China’s economic growth also contributed to
the 2012 loss, the company said in its January filing to the
stock exchange.  China’s economy  expanded 7.8 percent in 2012,
the least in 13 years.  Gome’s retail stores fell from 1,079 to 1,049 at the end of
2012. Its overall China store count will grow by about 30
outlets this year, mostly in the smaller cities outside of
Shanghai and Beijing, Anita Sun, deputy manager at the company’s
investor relations department said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
