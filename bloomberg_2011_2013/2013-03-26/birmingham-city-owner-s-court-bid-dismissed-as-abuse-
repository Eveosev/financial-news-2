A bid by  Carson Yeung , owner of the
English soccer club  Birmingham City , to transfer a HK$721
million ($92.9 million)  money laundering  case against him to the
 High Court  was dismissed as “frivolous” by a Hong Kong judge.  Judge Alan Wright said in a ruling today that the motion
was an abuse of process designed to disrupt a District Court
trial scheduled for next month. Kevin Zervos, the director of
public prosecutions, argued earlier today that it was a delay
tactic because Yeung was seeking to send the case to a court
that could impose harsher sentences.  “They’re arguing they want to go to a higher court because
he deserves a higher sentence if convicted,” Zervos said. The
bid reflected the ‘procrastination and delay employed by the
applicant to put off the trial.”  Birmingham International Holdings Ltd. (2309) , the West Midlands-
based team’s parent company, has been suspended from trading in
Hong Kong since June 2011, when Yeung, its chairman, was charged
with five counts of money laundering. Yeung’s lawyers in
November won a five-month delay to the trial after arguing that
more time was needed to gather evidence to show how the
hairdresser became a successful businessman.  Yeung’s lawyer Daniel Fung, said that “many people prefer
a High Court trial.”  The case is Yeung Ka-sing Carson and Secretary of Justice,
HCAL59/2013 in the Court of First Instance. The money laundering
case is Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Yeung Ka-
sing Carson, DCCC860/2011 in the Hong Kong District Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
