Croatia  got the final green light
to join the European Union in July, winning EU approval for
steps to overhaul its shipbuilding industry, streamline the
justice system and stiffen border controls.  Croatia’s completion of 10 “priority actions” puts it on
track to become the bloc’s 28th member, the  European Commission 
said today in a report released in Brussels.  “Croatia’s forthcoming accession is the result of 10 years
of a rigorous process, which started with its application for
membership in 2003,” said the commission, which oversees EU
expansion.  European governments are touting the entry of Croatia and
 Latvia ’s likely adoption of the euro next January as signs of
the bloc’s continued appeal in the face of the three-year debt
crisis.  “There are many challenges and opportunities for expansion
further in the Balkans,” EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan
Fule told a news conference in Zagreb. “There is talk of
expansion fatigue but we seem to have a reform fatigue.”  So far, 22 EU countries have ratified Croatia’s entry
treaty. The commission said it expects the remaining five to do
so “in good time” so Croatia can join on July 1. Slovenian
lawmakers are set to approve Croatia’s entry into the world’s
largest trading bloc on April 2.  “Croatia will do all in its power to help others in the
region to enforce reforms needed for EU membership,” Croatian
Foreign Minister  Vesna Pusic  told the same news conference.  To contact the reporters on this story:
