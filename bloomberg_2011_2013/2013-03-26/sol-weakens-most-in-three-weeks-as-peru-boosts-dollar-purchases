Peru’s sol fell the most in three
weeks as the South American country’s central bank boosted its
dollar purchases to help slow the currency’s appreciation.  The sol weakened 0.2 percent to 2.5870 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close of trading in  Lima , the biggest drop since March 6,
according to prices from Datatec. The central bank bought $120
million for 2.5854 soles per dollar today, according to a
statement on its  website .  The monetary authority this week has increased the amount
of its daily dollar purchases to almost triple the average $47
million per day recorded this month, according to central bank
data. The bank, which also bought $120 million in the foreign-
exchange market yesterday, is purchasing greenbacks to help
limit the currency’s volatility after inflows surged in 2012,
said RBS Securities Inc. analyst Felipe Hernandez.  “It’s a relatively high amount,” Hernandez said today in
a telephone interview from  Stamford ,  Connecticut . The central
bank’s “goal is not necessarily to avoid the currency
appreciating, but rather just to slow down the pace and speed
with which the currency is appreciating to give time” to the
rest of the economy to adjust.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due
August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.80 percent at 3:35 p.m. in Lima, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian
 government bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries increased two basis
points to 149 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
