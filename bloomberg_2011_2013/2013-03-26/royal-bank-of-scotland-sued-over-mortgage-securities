Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest taxpayer-owned lender, was sued by a bond
insurer over what it claims was the bank’s sale of $1.15 billion
of securities backed by “thousands of defective and
fraudulently originated” home loans.  The insurer, Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp., sued RBS in
federal court in Manhattan today, alleging that it expects to
pay $100 million in claims by investors in the securitization,
Soundview Home Loan Trust 2007-WMC1.  Assured claimed in its complaint that the loans, which were
originated by WMC Mortgage Corp., failed to adhere to claimed
lending standards. Investors lost money when many of the
mortgages defaulted, causing the certificates to drop from AAA-
rated to junk status, according to the insurer. Assured said it
insured interest and principal payments on $291 million of the
Soundview certificates.  “RBS Financial Products purchased and securitized the
mortgage loans for the Soundview transaction without regard for
the fact that WMC routinely ignored its stated underwriting
guidelines and originated mortgage loans without regard to the
borrowers’ ability to repay,” Hamilton, Bermuda-based Assured
said in the complaint.  Ed Canaday, a U.S. spokesman for Edinburgh-based RBS,
declined to comment on the suit.  The case is Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. v. RBS
Securities Inc., 13-cv-2019, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
