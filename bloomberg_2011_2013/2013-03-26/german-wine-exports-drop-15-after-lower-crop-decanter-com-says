Germany ’s wine exports fell 15
percent to 1.3 million hectoliters last year following a
decline of 12 percent in 2011, according to data from the
German Wine Institute, Decanter.com said.  A reduction in sales to the U.S., U.K. and  Russia  led the
2012 drop, which was 8 percent in value terms, while some
smaller markets showed gains, according to Decanter magazine’s
website. The retreat in exports reflected a smaller 2010 crop,
as well as fiercer competition for lower-priced wines and
changes in Russian import rules, Decanter.com said.          Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
