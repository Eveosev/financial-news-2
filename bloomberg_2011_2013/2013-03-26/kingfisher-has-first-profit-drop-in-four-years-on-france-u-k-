Kingfisher Plc (KGF) , Europe’s largest
home-improvement chain, reported the first decline in annual
profit in four years as sales struggled in the U.K. and France,
its two largest markets.  Adjusted pretax profit fell 11 percent to 715 million
pounds ($1.09 billion) in the year ended Jan. 31, the London-
based retailer said today in a statement. That compares with the
714.4 million-pound average estimate of 17 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The annual dividend rose 7 percent to 9.46 pence.  The owner of France’s Castorama chain and B&Q in the U.K.
has had sales falter as weakening  consumer confidence  weighs on
shoppers’ desire to spend on their homes, while a wet summer
slowed sales of seasonal products in the U.K.. The retailer has
resorted to increased promotions, hurting margins.  “We have had a tough year, impacted by unfavorable foreign
exchange, record adverse weather in the U.K. and declining
underlying markets in each of our three key territories,” of
 France , the U.K., and Poland, Chief Executive Officer Ian Cheshire said in the statement.  The stock fell 1.5 percent to 283.3 pence in  London  trading
yesterday. It has declined 0.3 percent this year, giving the
retailer a market value of about 6.7 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
