 Crude options volatility fell as
underlying oil futures rose the most this year after U.S. orders
for durable goods climbed more than forecast in February.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, settled at 16.36 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, down from 17.12 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate oil for May delivery advanced
$1.53, or 1.6 percent, to $96.34 a barrel on the Nymex, the
biggest increase since Dec. 26 and the highest settlement since
Feb. 19. The Commerce Department said bookings for goods meant
to last at least three years rose the most since September.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $89 puts, which fell 13 cents to 10 cents a barrel on volume
of 3,790 contracts. May $88 puts were the second-most active,
with 3,289 lots traded. They declined 9 cents to 7 cents a
barrel.  Puts accounted for 61 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the prior session, puts were 64 percent of trading volume.  May $85 puts were the most active options traded in
yesterdayâ€™s session, with 7,826 contracts changing hands. They
fell 6 cents to 5 cents a barrel. May $87 puts were down 11
cents to 11 cents a barrel on 5,200 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
36,505 contracts. Next were December $110 calls at 32,428
followed by June $90 puts at 31,610.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
