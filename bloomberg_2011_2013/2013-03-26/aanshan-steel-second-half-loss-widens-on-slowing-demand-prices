Maanshan Iron & Steel (600808)  Co., the
second-biggest Hong Kong-traded mill, reported a wider second-
half loss as slowing economic growth cut demand and prices.  The company’s net loss was 1.97 billion  yuan  ($317 million)
in the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of 240
million yuan a year earlier. The result was derived by deducting
six-month figures from full-year earnings released today in a
statement.  China ’s steel mills saw aggregate earnings tumble 98
percent to 1.58 billion yuan last year, the China Iron and Steel
Association said Jan. 31. The Chinese economy grew  7.4 percent 
in the third quarter, the slowest pace in three years, sapping
steel demand from builders and automakers and reducing profits
at mills.  “In 2013, the demand for steel from the international
market still will not be robust,”the Anhui province-based
Maanshan Steel said in the statement. “The situation the steel
industry faces may improve, but the fundamentals of overcapacity
won’t be changed.”  The company had a loss of 3.86 billion yuan in 2012, it
said in the statement, its worst results since an initial public
offering in 1993. Maanshan fell 2.8 percent to close at HK$2.05
in Hong Kong today before the earnings announcement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
