France  is selling about 13 million
shares of  Safran SA (SAF) , Europe’s second-biggest maker of aircraft
engines, for as much as 452 million euros ($581 million).  The shares are being sold at 34.50 euros to 34.80 euros,
according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News. That’s a
discount of as much as 2.8 percent to yesterday’s  closing price .
The offering represents about 3.1 percent of Safran’s
outstanding stock, the term sheet shows.  France owned about 30 percent of Safran at the end of last
year, according to the company’s website. The Paris-based
aerospace company, led by Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Herteman, generated 13.6 billion euros in revenue in 2012.  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  is managing the offering, which is
scheduled to price today, the term sheet shows. Safran rose less
than 1 percent yesterday in Paris trading to 35.49 euros, for a
market capitalization of 14.8 billion euros. The stock has
 climbed  about 31 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
