TDC A/S (TDC)  fell the most in more than
two weeks in Copenhagen trading after Danske Bank A/S said
recent gains have made the stock “fully valued.”  TDC  fell  as much as 1.5 percent to 45.30 kroner, the most
since March 8, making it the biggest decliner on the Copenhagen
 benchmark  index. The stock declined 1.1 percent to 45.47 kroner
at 11:06 a.m. in the Danish capital, with trading volume at 22
percent of the three-month daily average.  “Given its strong outperformance of the sector in recent
months, we believe the shares are fully valued,” Danske Bank
said in a note, cutting its  rating  to hold from buy.  TDC has gained 14 percent in the past three months, making
it the third-best performer among Europe telecommunications
companies, according to  data compiled  by Bloomberg. The share
trailed only Vodafone Group Plc and BT Group Plc.  Morgan Stanley picked TDC on March 5 as one of its favorite
telecommunication operators outside the euro, saying it offered
“the best combination of fundamentals and valuation.”  Berenberg Bank also cut its rating to hold from buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
