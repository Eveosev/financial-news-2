Romania ’s leu strengthened for a
second day as a bailout agreement for Cyprus and expectations of
improved U.S. economic data spurred investor appetite for
riskier, emerging-market assets.  Yesterday’s agreement by finance ministers from the 17-
nation euro area on the outlines of an aid package for Cyprus
boosted the leu for the first time in three days. European
stocks rose for the first day in four before reports today that
may show durable-goods orders increased in the U.S. while new-
house sales held close to a four-year high last month.  “We expect leu to continue to gradually head for stronger
levels, below 4.4 per euro, as Cyprus crisis effect tapers
off,” analysts at BRD-Groupe Societe Generale SA, including
Bucharest-based Roxana Hulea wrote in a note today.  The leu appreciated 0.1 percent to 4.4127 per euro by 11:50
a.m. in Bucharest, the highest level on a closing basis since
March 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency 
has advanced 0.8 percent this year, the third-best performance
among peers in eastern  Europe  and  Africa  tracked by Bloomberg.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei provided funding in line
with demands from commercial lenders at its weekly repurchase
operations for a fourth week yesterday after limiting liquidity
for five months to help boost the currency. The central bank
lent 3.5 billion lei ($1 billion), more than the 247 million lei
provided a week earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
