OHL Mexico SAB (OHLMEX*) , the Mexican unit of
Spanish construction company  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) , plunged
the most on record after the company said it would issue
convertible bonds.  Shares fell 9.2 percent to 34.86 pesos at the close of
trading in  Mexico  City, the steepest drop since they started
trading in November 2010. Volume was more than 24 times the
three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  OHL plans to sell at least 250 million euros ($321 million)
of five-year debt convertible to OHL Mexico stock, according to
a regulatory filing. The offering may be increased to as much as
300 million euros if an overallotment option is exercised. The
bonds may be exchanged for ordinary shares equivalent to about
7.5 percent of capital, according to the filing.  The proceeds may be used to prepay existing debt of a
different OHL unit, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts Eugenio Amador and Julian Bravo wrote in an e-mailed not to clients
today. OHL Mexico will still need to refinance its current
obligations and access new financing in the next three years,
the analysts wrote.  “This convertible bond issuance will not provide OHL
Mexico with cash proceeds to face these obligations generating
the possibility of an equity dilution and complicating their
possibility of accessing new financing,” Amador and Bravo
wrote.  OHL Mexico has gained 23 percent in 2013 as Mexico’s
benchmark IPC index slipped 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
