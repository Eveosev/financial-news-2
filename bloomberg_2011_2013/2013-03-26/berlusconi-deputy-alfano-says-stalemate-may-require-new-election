Angelino Alfano, the head of Silvio Berlusconi’s political party, said talks to form a ruling
parliamentary coalition in  Italy  haven’t yielded an agreement
and a snap election may be required to resolve the stalemate.  “The positions remain very distant,” Alfano said today in
 Rome  after meeting with Pier Luigi Bersani, who controls the
biggest force in parliament. “If they remain distant this way
over the next 48 hours, we will reiterate the only way is to go
to elections.”  Bersani is seeking help from political adversaries after
inconclusive elections Feb. 24-25 gave his forces a majority in
the lower house of parliament and left the Senate split into
three blocs. In order to become prime minister, the 61-year-old
Bersani must get a deal by March 28, when he is scheduled to
speak with President Giorgio Napolitano.  “It was a brief meeting, approached with a constructive
spirit,” Alfano said.  Bersani, the head of Italy’s  Democratic Party , will meet
representatives of Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement tomorrow.
Five Star has the third-biggest Senate presence after Bersani
and Berlusconi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
