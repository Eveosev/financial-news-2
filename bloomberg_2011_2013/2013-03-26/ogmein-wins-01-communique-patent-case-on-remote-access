LogMeIn Inc. (LOGM)  said it won a patent-
infringement trial in a case brought by  01 Communique Laboratory
Inc. (ONE)  over a way to provide remote access to a desktop computer.  A federal jury in Alexandria,  Virginia , today found that
LogMeIn products don’t infringe as asserted by 01 Communique,
LogMeIn said in an e-mailed statement.  LogMeIn rose as much as 22 percent, to $21.74, before
Nasdaq Stock Market trading was halted.  “This validates LogMeIn’s long-standing tradition of
investing in the development of unique and innovative
products,” Michael Simon, chief executive officer of LogMeIn,
said in the statement. “We will continue to vigorously defend
patent lawsuits.”  The trial was over technology that lets one computer access
another remotely over the Internet. LogMeIn previously won the
case after U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton said it didn’t
infringe the patent. The case was revived last year by an
appeals court.  LogMeIn, based in Woburn,  Massachusetts , provides
information-technology management services that allow people to
work from any Internet-enabled device. The company reported
$138.8 million in sales last year.  In its annual report, LogMeIn warned that losing the case
“could prevent us from offering all or a portion of our
services to customers” or cause it to pay ongoing licensing
fees.  01 Communique reported $174,475 in revenue in the quarter
ended Jan. 31. The company, based in Mississauga, Ontario, runs
the “I’m InTouch” remote-access service.  It has an infringement case against  Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS) 
over the same patent. That case has been on hold for the past
five years while the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office takes a
second look at the validity of the patent.  The case is 01 Communique Laboratory Inc. v. LogMeIn Inc.,
10cv1007, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia (Alexandria).  To contact the reporters on this story:
