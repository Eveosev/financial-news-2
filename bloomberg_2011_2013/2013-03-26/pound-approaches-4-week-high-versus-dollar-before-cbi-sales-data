The pound approached the highest
level in four weeks versus the dollar before an industry report
that economists said will show U.K.  retail sales  increased this
month.  Sterling was about 0.2 percent from a six-week high against
the euro. A gauge of annual sales growth climbed to 13 from 8 in
February, the  Confederation of British Industry  will say today,
according to the median estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg
News  survey . The Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell 1
billion pounds ($1.52 billion) of gilts maturing in 2025.  The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.5185 at 7:52 a.m. London
time. It rose to $1.5269 yesterday, the most since Feb. 22.
Sterling was little changed at 84.72 pence per euro, after
appreciating to 84.58 pence yesterday, the strongest level since
Feb. 11.  The pound gained 0.9 percent in the past month, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10
developed-nation currencies. The euro weakened 1.2 percent and
the dollar climbed 0.5 percent.  U.K. gilts returned 1.6 percent this month through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds earned 0.7 percent, while Treasuries fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
