Stocks in Switzerland  advanced amid
better-than-forecast reports on U.S. durable-goods orders and
 house prices  and as Cie. Financiere Richemont SA and  Swatch
Group AG (UHR)  increased.  Richemont, the owner of the Cartier brand, and Swatch, the
largest maker of Swiss watches, advanced more than 2 percent.
 Novartis AG (NOVN)  rose 1.1 percent, contributing the most to the
benchmark index’s gain. Financial shares climbed, with  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  rising.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  gained 0.5 percent to 7,800.05 at
the close of trading in Zurich, after earlier slipping as much
as 0.2 percent. The gauge retreated 1.5 percent last week, its
first loss in six weeks and the biggest drop since Nov. 16. The
SMI has still  climbed 14 percent  this year. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also rose 0.5 percent today.  “The economic data out of the U.S. was somewhat
lackluster,” said Andreas Nigg, head of equity and commodity
strategy at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich. “Perhaps we
are seeing some first signs that the sequester is impacting the
economy. But at the same time, that means any discussion on
quantitative easing exiting will remain on the back burner. The
home prices report was very positive news for U.S. households.”  Swiss stocks rose yesterday as Cyprus and euro-area finance
ministers agreed on a rescue package, dodging the risk of a
default and an exit from the currency union.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the SMI
was 15 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Economy  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report showed that
orders for durable goods climbed more than forecast in February.
Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years rose 5.7
percent, the most since September, after a 3.8 percent drop the
prior month. The  median  forecast of 80 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 3.9 percent advance.  The  S&P/Case-Shiller index  of property values in 20 cities
climbed 8.1 percent in January from the same month in 2012 after
rising 6.8 percent in the year ended in December, the group said
today in  New York . The increase exceeded the 7.9 percent median
forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Separate data showed that  sales  of new houses in February
capped the best back-to-back months in more than four years.
Purchases of newly built homes fell 4.6 percent to a 411,000
annualized pace, following a 431,000 rate in the prior month
that was lower than previously estimated, the Commerce
Department reported today in  Washington . The  median  estimate of
78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a decrease to
420,000. It was the best two-month showing since August and
September 2008.  Richemont gained 2.3 percent to 75.25 Swiss francs and
Swatch rose 2.3 percent to 543 francs.  Novartis added 1.1 percent to 67.40 francs, contributing
the most to the SMI’s advance.  Credit Suisse,  Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank, increased
1.5 percent to 25.33 francs, while Swiss Life, Switzerland’s
largest life insurer, rose 0.7 percent to 143.30 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
