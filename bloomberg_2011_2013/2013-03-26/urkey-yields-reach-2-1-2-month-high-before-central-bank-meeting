Turkey ’s benchmark bond  yields 
climbed to the highest level in 2 1/2 months on speculation
growth in loans will force the central bank to raise lenders’
reserve requirements at a policy meeting today.  Yields on two-year notes rose for a third day before the
bank’s Monetary Policy Committee decision at 2 p.m. in Ankara.
The panel will probably keep its benchmark one-week repo rate
unchanged at 5.5 percent, according to the  median estimate  of 13
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Loan growth during the past year to March 15 accelerated to
19.9 percent, from 19.6 percent as at the end of the previous
week, according to data published by the banking regulator
yesterday. That’s above the central bank’s target of 15 percent
by year-end. The central bank has raised the reserve requirement
ratios this year to limit lending and prevent an expansion of
the  current-account deficit  through increased imports.  The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency data show
even faster growth in lending at 20.8 percent, as of March 15,
Erkin Isik, a fixed-income strategist at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi
AS (TEBNK) , said in an e-mailed note. “This increases the chances of a
reserve requirement rate hike today,” he said.  Yields on two-year benchmark bonds added four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.35 percent at 12:25 p.m. in
Istanbul, the highest level on a closing basis since Jan. 4. The
lira appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.8198 per dollar.  “The majority of economists are expecting increases of
0.25 percent to 0.50 percent in lira and foreign-exchange
reserve requirements,” Baris Buyukdemir, the general manager of
Ceros Menkul Degerler AS in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed note,
citing a survey by CNCB-e television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
