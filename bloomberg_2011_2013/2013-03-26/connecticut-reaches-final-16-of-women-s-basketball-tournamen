The  University of Connecticut 
became the first No. 1 regional seed to advance to the final 16
of college basketball’s national women’s tournament with a 77-44
rout of Vanderbilt University.  It’s the 20th straight season that UConn has reached the
regional semifinals of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association women’s tournament.  Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis scored 22 points to lead the Huskies
(31-4), who opened a 37-24 halftime lead and then went on a 17-0
scoring run to start the second half.  “Our defense was so good that it never felt like we were
struggling to keep the lead,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said at
a news conference. “That’s exactly what you need at this time
of the year.”  Connecticut, which is seeking an eighth national title,
next faces No. 4 seed Maryland in the semifinals of the
Bridgeport region on March 30.  The other three women’s No. 1 regional seeds -- Baylor
University,  Stanford University  and the University of  Notre Dame 
-- play second-round tournament games today for spots in the
final 16. Defending-champion Baylor plays Florida State, while
Notre Dame meets Iowa and Stanford faces Michigan.  Tennessee also advanced to the round of 16 with a win last
night, as did Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Georgia and California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
