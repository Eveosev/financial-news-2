PT Matahari Department Store (LPPF) ’s
shares surged by 158 percent in Jakarta after investors sold
stock of Indonesia’s largest retailer by market capitalization
at more than double the market price.  Matahari soared to 10,850 rupiah as of 3:49 p.m. local
time, as it resumed trading for the first time since March 8,
when it settled at 4,200 rupiah. The stock was poised for its
 highest  close based on data compiled by Bloomberg going back to
August 1991. The shares accounted for 42 percent of the Jakarta
Composite Index’s 1.5 percent advance today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Asia Color Co. and PT Multipolar  sold  a total of 129.03
million shares at 10,850 rupiah to 200 institutional investors,
Multipolar said in a statement to  Indonesia ’s stock exchange
yesterday. CVC Capital and Lippo Group sold 1.167 billion shares
at that price, three people with knowledge of the matter said
last week.  Purchasers of the shares “have a very long-term view on
Indonesia,” Laurentia Amica Darmawan, who helps manage about
$510 million at PT First State Investment Indonesia, said by
phone today. “That is why they can justify that kind of
valuation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
