Brazil ’s swap rates dropped for a
third straight day as a report showed monthly deflation in Sao
Paulo, spurring speculation that the central bank will push back
an increase in borrowing costs.  Swap rates due January 2015 fell three basis points to 8.48
percent at 9:42 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real was little changed
at 2.0120 per dollar.  Sao Paulo’s consumer prices decreased 0.18 percent in the
four weeks through March 23, Foundation Economics Research
Institute reported today. That compares with a 0.11 drop in the
period ended in mid-March.  “The Sao Paulo consumer prices data showed there is
deflation,”  Newton Rosa , the chief economist at SulAmerica
Investimentos in Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview. “Risk
aversion has also been high, with the problem in Cyprus leaving
the market without confidence.”  Cyprus Finance Minister Michael Sarris sought to muffle
calls for the country to weigh a precedent-setting exit from the
euro to ease economic pain. The island’s government cleared the
way for a 10 billion euro ($13 billion) European bailout after
agreeing to shrink its banking system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
