Dollar General  Corp.’s debt was
raised two levels to investment grade by Moody’s Investors
Service because of expectations its profit will continue to
increase.  The rating was lifted to Baa3 with a stable outlook from
Ba2, New York-based Moody’s wrote today in a note. Dollar
General is rated BBB-, the lowest level of investment grade, by
Standard & Poor’s, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The largest U.S. dollar-store chain has boosted sales and
earnings as consumers hunt for bargains amid elevated
unemployment and weak economic growth. Net income in the year
ended Feb. 1 rose 24 percent $952.7 million.  “Moody’s views the dollar store sector favorably and
expect that it will continue to grow given its low price points
and its relative resistance to economic cycles,” the firm said
in the note.  Dollar General, based in Goodlettsville,  Tennessee , rose
2.2 percent to $52.22 at the close in  New York . The  shares  have
gained 18 percent this year, compared with a 9.6 percent advance
for the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
