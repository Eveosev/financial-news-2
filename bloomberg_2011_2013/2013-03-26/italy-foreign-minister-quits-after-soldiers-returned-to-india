Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi resigned after failing to prevent his government from
returning two soldiers to  India  to face charges of murder.  “I can no longer take part in this government,” Terzi
said today in a speech in  Italy ’s lower house of parliament in
Rome. “The doubts I expressed about the return of the marines
to India didn’t have any effect.”  Terzi was applauded in the Chamber of Deputies, reflecting
the unpopularity of the government’s decision on March 21 to
send Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone back to India to
resolve a diplomatic standoff. That move came less than two
weeks after Prime Minister Mario Monti’s administration said on
March 11 the two soldiers would remain in Italy.  “The honor of our country, of the armed forces and Italian
diplomacy, diplomacy that has made extraordinary sacrifices,
must be safeguarded,” Terzi said.  Monti will speak tomorrow in parliament, Chamber Speaker
Laura Boldrini said after representatives of various parties
called on the premier to appear.  To contact the reporters on this story:
