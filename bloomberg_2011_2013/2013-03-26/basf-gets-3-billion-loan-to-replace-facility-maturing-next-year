(Corrects currency amount in headline, first paragraph in
story published March 26.)  BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s biggest
chemicals maker, raised a 3 billion-euro ($3.83 billion)
revolving credit facility to replace a credit line maturing next
year.  The five-year transaction, which can be extended by as much
as two years, refinances a $2.25 billion facility, said Jennifer
Moore-Braun, a spokeswoman for Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF,
in an e-mail. Under a revolver, money repaid can be borrowed
again.  Lenders offered the company more than double the amount
sought and commitments to the deal were scaled back, according
to two people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified because the terms are private. Citigroup Inc., ING
Groep NV, LBBW and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  arranged the
transaction, they said.  The loan pays an initial interest rate of 25 basis points
more than benchmark lending rates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  BASF is  rated  A1 by Moody’s Investors Service and A+ by
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, the fifth-highest
investment grade level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
