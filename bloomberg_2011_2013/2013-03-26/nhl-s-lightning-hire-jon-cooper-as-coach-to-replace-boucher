Jon Cooper was hired as coach of
the  Tampa Bay Lightning  after three seasons leading the National
Hockey League team’s top minor league affiliate.  Cooper, 45, replaces Guy Boucher, who was fired two days
ago with the Lightning in next-to-last place in the NHL’s
Eastern Conference. Cooper had a 133-62-26 record in the
American Hockey League with the Norfolk Admirals from 2010-12
and the Syracuse Crunch this season.  “He has had success at every level he has coached and is
extremely familiar with our organization, as well as our
players,” Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman said in a
 statement . “He has a tremendous record at all levels and we
feel he is ready to make the move to the NHL.”  Cooper was named the AHL’s top coach last season after
leading the Admirals to the Calder Cup Championship. This season,
he’s led the Crunch to an AHL-best 39-18-8 record.  The Lightning have a 13-18-1 record this season for 27
points, the third-fewest in the NHL. Cooper will coach his first
game with  Tampa Bay  on March 29 against the  New Jersey Devils .  To contact the reporter on this story:
