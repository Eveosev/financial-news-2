Japanese  shares  fell on concern a
bailout plan for Cyprus will set a precedent for losses on  bank
deposits  in other European nations. Exporters pared declines
after the yen weakened as the  Bank of Japan (8301)  governor outlined
monetary easing steps.  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc., a lensmaker that gets 28
percent of sales from  Europe , fell 6 percent to lead losses on
the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s
biggest carmaker, slid 0.2 percent after falling as much as 1.6
percent. Softbank Corp.,  Japan ’s third-biggest mobile operator,
rose 2.8 percent after saying it will raise a stake in games
developer Gungho Online Entertainment Inc. NEC Corp. jumped 4.1
percent after Reuters reported the maker of telecommunications
gear will sell its stake in unit NEC Mobiling Ltd.  The Nikkei 225 slid 0.6 percent to 12,471.62 at the close
in  Tokyo , with volume 20 percent below the 30-day average. The
broader Topix Index declined 0.3 percent to 1,044.42, with about
as many stocks falling as rising.  Risk aversion  “is spreading because of the Cyprus
problem,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , chief  fund manager  at Shinkin
Asset Management Co., which oversees about 498 billion yen ($5.3
billion). “Investors are closely watching to see what kind of
monetary easing details come out from the BOJ, and they’re
expecting further measures.”  The Topix rallied 45 percent from Nov. 14, when elections
were announced that brought Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to power
on a platform of increased stimulus and central bank easing. The
gauge is trading at 1.2 times book value, compared with 2.2
times net assets for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Easing Expectations  The yen weakened after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda told parliament today that he will consider buying more
 government bonds  with longer maturities and vowed to consider
scrapping a self-imposed rule limiting the scale of asset
buying. Yields on 10-year government bonds fell to the lowest
since June 2003. The Bank of Japan has its next policy meeting
April 3-4.  The yen was little changed against the dollar after rising
as much as 0.3 percent. Japan’s currency was 0.2 percent weaker
against the euro, trading at 121.27.  Toyota fell 0.2 percent to 4,910 yen. Electronics-maker
Panasonic Corp. fell 0.4 percent to 673 yen, paring a decline of
as much as 1.5 percent.  Cyprus Aid  Cyprus agreed yesterday to the outline of an aid package
that imposes losses that two European Union officials said would
be as much as 40 percent on uninsured depositors at Bank of
Cyprus Plc. Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who
leads the group of 17 euro finance ministers, said the bailout
should be viewed as a template for solving banking problems in
the region, Reuters reported.  Konica Minolta  slumped 6 percent to 705 yen, its biggest
drop since October 2011. Trend Micro Inc., a maker of antivirus
software that gets 17 percent of its sales from Europe, declined
3.1 percent to 2,689 yen.  Softbank rose 2.5 percent to 3,975 yen, its highest level
since 2006. The carrier will spend as much as 25 billion yen to
raise its stake in Gungho, which has surged 380 percent this
year on the rising popularity of its “Puzzle & Dragons” game.  NEC rose 4.1 percent to 253 yen, the biggest gain on the
Nikkei. The company plans to sell its majority stake in NEC
Mobiling for 70 billion to 80 billion yen, Reuters reported. The
unit’s shares jumped 15 percent to 5,510 yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  gained 2.6
percent to 26.33 today, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 7.5 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
