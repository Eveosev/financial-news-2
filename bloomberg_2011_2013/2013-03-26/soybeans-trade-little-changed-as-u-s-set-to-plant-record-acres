Soybeans traded little changed even
after  China , the biggest buyer, bought from U.S. exporters as
investors awaited a government report this week expected to show
that planting in the country may rise to a record.  The oilseed for delivery in May was at $14.36 a bushel,
from $14.3725 yesterday, on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 10:40
a.m. in Singapore. The volume was 68 percent below the 100-day
average for that time of day. Futures earlier rose 0.2 percent.  Farmers in the U.S. are forecast to plant 78.3 million
acres (31.7 million hectares) this year, according to a
Bloomberg survey. The nation’s inventories as of March 1
probably fell to 948 million bushels, the  smallest  for that
quarter since 2004, a separate survey showed. The  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  is due to release the acreage and
stockpiles report on March 28.  “It’s hard to have a positive position” ahead of the USDA
report,  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager for research at Nihon
Unicom Inc., said in an e-mail from  Tokyo  today.  U.S. exporters sold 234,000 metric tons to China for
delivery in the year starting Sept. 1, the USDA said yesterday.
The Asian nation has already bought 4 million tons for delivery
in the next marketing year as of March 14, USDA data show.  In Brazil, poised to be the world’s largest grower this
year, about 209 vessels set to ship 12.4 million tons of
soybeans and related products are berthed, arrived or expected
at major ports as of March 25, according to SA Commodities and
Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos.  It may take six months to finish transporting  Brazil ’s
soybean crops to ports and exported, Bunge Ltd. said Feb. 20.
The South American nation was estimated by the USDA to export
38.4 million tons, surpassing the drought-hit U.S. as the
largest shipper this year.  Corn for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to $7.315 a bushel
in Chicago, while wheat added 0.2 percent to $7.285 a bushel.  The initial margin for new-crop corn futures contracts in
Chicago will rise to $2,700 at the end of business today, from
$2,025, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said in a statement. The
initial margin for hedges and members will rise to $2,000 from
$1,500 for new-crop corn contracts, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
