West Texas Intermediate crude
advanced the most this year as U.S. orders for durable goods
climbed more than forecast in February. WTI’s discount to Brent
was the narrowest since July.  Futures climbed to the highest level in five weeks after
the Commerce Department said bookings for goods meant to last at
least three years rose the most since September. Gains in WTI
accelerated after the May contract breached technical resistance
at $95.55. The spread between WTI and Brent,  Europe ’s benchmark,
shrank as U.S. refinery demand and North Sea output increased.  “The durable goods number is higher than expected and it
shows the U.S. economy is on good footing,” said Tariq Zahir, a
New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.
“You are continuing to see the Brent-WTI spread contract
massively.”  WTI for May delivery climbed $1.53, or 1.6 percent, to
$96.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest
rally since Dec. 26 and the highest settlement since Feb. 19.
Prices are up 4.9 percent in 2013. The volume of all futures
traded was 3.7 percent above the 100-day average for the time of
day at 3:35 p.m.  Oil slipped to $96.22 at 4:41 p.m. after the American
Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. inventories increased
3.74 million barrels last week to 380.4 million.  Brent for May settlement increased $1.19, or 1.1 percent,
to $109.36 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The volume of all futures traded was 24 percent above
the 100-day average. Prices have fallen 1.6 percent in 2013. The
European benchmark crude’s premium to WTI narrowed to $13.02,
the least since July 3 on a settlement basis.  U.S. Economy  Durable goods orders gained 5.7 percent in February, more
than the 3.9 percent forecast by economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, Commerce Department data showed.  “The durable goods number is very good,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in
Winchester,  Massachusetts . “People have turned positive about
the U.S. economy, and that brings up WTI more so than Brent.”  The U.S., the world’s biggest oil consuming country,
accounted for 21 percent of the world’s oil consumption in 2011,
according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  U.S. stocks gained, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index up
as much as 0.8 percent.  “Oil is doing beautifully,” said Jeff Grossman, president
of New York-based BRG Brokerage and a Nymex floor trader. “The
next real level of resistance is probably around the $97.40
area.”  Fibonacci Level  The May futures settled above $95.55, the 61.8 percent
retracement level on a Fibonacci study of the drop from the 2013
high of $99.11 on Feb. 13 to the low of $89.78 on March 4.  “No one wants to be short right now,” said Bill Baruch, a
senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “We went
over the $95.55 major retracement level.”  Prices also advanced amid forecasts that refineries boosted
production to the highest level since Feb. 1 last week, a
Bloomberg survey of analysts showed.  U.S. refineries  operated  at 84 percent of capacity last
week, an increase of 0.5 percentage point from the prior period,
according to the median of analyst estimates in the survey.
Utilization surged 2.5 percentage points to 83.5 percent in the
week ended March 15 after falling to 81 percent in the seven
days to March 8, the weakest level since February 2011.  Refinery units are often idled for maintenance in February
and March as attention shifts away from heating oil and before
gasoline consumption rises during the summer months.  U.S. Supply  Oil  inventories  probably rose 1.33 million barrels to 384
million last week as domestic production stayed near the most in
21 years and imports rebounded, the survey showed.  Inventories of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, probably fell 850,000 barrels to 118.9
million, according to the median of responses in the Bloomberg
survey. Gasoline  stockpiles  probably slid 1 million barrels to
221.8 million, the survey predicted.  Brent oil in  London  lagged WTI’s advance as exports of the
12 main North Sea crude grades will rise by 3.4 percent in April
to 1.98 million barrels a day, according to loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May was at 16.3 percent, down from 17.1 percent
yesterday. The figures have slipped from 24.7 percent on Feb.
21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 491,354
contracts as of 4:34 p.m. It totaled 644,014 contracts
yesterday, 18 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.67 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
