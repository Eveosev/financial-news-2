Trends affecting U.S.  consumer
spending  have turned positive,  Nariman Behravesh , chief
economist at researcher IHS Automotive, said today at an auto
forum in  New York .  “We saw a downtick to  consumer confidence  from the
sequester, but despite the payroll tax increase and a recent gas
price increase, the fundamentals of consumer spending have
strengthened and are very positive,” Behravesh said at the
gathering, sponsored by J.D. Power & Associates and the National
Automobile Dealers Association, held in connection with the  New
York auto show .  New-car buyers, shunned by lenders just four years ago, are
benefiting from historically low  interest rates  and better
access to financing. U.S. light-vehicle sales in the first two
months of 2013 rose 8.4 percent to 2.24 million, according to
researcher Autodata Corp.  Democrats and Republicans are deadlocked over how to
replace mandated across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration,
totaling $1.2 trillion over nine years. The sequester could cut
0.5 percentage points from growth in 2013, with the biggest
impact in the second quarter, Behravesh said.  “Things are really starting to look good in the U.S.,” he
said. “They could get detailed by what’s going on in
 Washington , but chances are they won’t be.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
