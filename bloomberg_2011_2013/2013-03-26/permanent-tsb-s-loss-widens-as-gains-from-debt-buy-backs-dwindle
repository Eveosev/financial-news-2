Permanent TSB Group Holdings Plc (IPM) ,
the Irish lender owned by the government, said its annual loss
more than doubled as dwindling gains from buying back its own
debt outweighed a decline in provisions for bad loans.  The net loss widened to 999 million euros ($1.29 billion)
in 2012 from 424 million euros in the year-earlier period, the
lender, formerly known as Irish Life & Permanent Plc, said in a
 statement  today. Gains from buying back debt securities at a
discount shrank to 224 million euros from 1 billion euros, and
impairments fell by almost 40 percent to 891 million euros.  “The foundations have been laid to build a profitable
bank,” Jeremy Masding, chief executive officer for the past 13
months, said in today’s statement. “The group today is
unrecognizable from its position at the start of 2012.”  The annual results are the first since the government
bought Permanent TSB’s insurance arm in June for 1.3 billion
euros. The sale helped the bank complete a 4 billion-euro
recapitalization ordered in 2011 by the nation’s central bank as
loan losses soared after the country’s domestic real-estate
bubble collapsed. The government last month sold the insurance
unit, Irish Life Group Ltd., to  Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) ,  Canada ’s
second-largest insurer.  About 21 percent of Permanent TSB’s Irish buy-to-let home
loans were at least 90 days in arrears on Dec. 31, compared with
16 percent in June, Permanent TSB said. The proportion of owner-
occupier loans in arrears rose to 15 percent from 11 percent, it
said.  Mortgage Provisions  Provisions for losses on Irish mortgages shrank by more
than 50 percent to 508 million euros from 1.17 billion euros in
2011. Commercial real-estate provisions rose to 320 million
euros from 179 million euros, the company said.  Irish banks’ bad loans soared following the collapse of the
nation’s real estate market and tripling of the unemployment
rate since 2007. The jobless rate stood at 14.1 percent in
February, according to the central statistics office. Houses
prices have tumbled by half from their 2007 peak, the Central
Statistics Office said today.  The government decided in April to split Permanent TSB into
three units under a plan that still needs European Commission
approval. It wants to create a viable consumer lender, an asset-
management unit to run down so-called uneconomic loans, and
another unit for its U.K. mortgage loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
