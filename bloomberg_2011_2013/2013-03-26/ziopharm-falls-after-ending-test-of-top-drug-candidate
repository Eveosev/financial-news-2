Ziopharm Oncology Inc. (ZIOP) , a maker of
experimental cancer treatments, tumbled the most in seven years
in New York trading after saying it would end plans to develop
its lead drug candidate for soft tissue tumors.  The company said it would shift its focus toward other
targets after the drug, palifosfamide, failed to meet its
primary goals in a study. In a statement today, New York-based
Ziopharm announced a restructuring to “align staffing to
current objectives.” The shares dropped 65 percent to $1.82 at
4 p.m. New York time, their biggest one-day decline since
November 2005.  Ziopharm shares had risen 23 percent for the year through
yesterday as Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Lewis said he was
in talks with other drugmakers to market palifosfamide. The
compound was in late-stage trials as a treatment for soft-tissue
sarcoma, a cancer of the muscle, fat and other body tissues. The
disease kills about 3,900 people a year in the U.S., according
to the  National Cancer Institute .  “It is imperative that the company rapidly focus its
resources and efforts on our highly promising synthetic biology
programs,” Lewis said in today’s statement. Those programs
include therapies that “represent the next-generation in
biotechnology.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
