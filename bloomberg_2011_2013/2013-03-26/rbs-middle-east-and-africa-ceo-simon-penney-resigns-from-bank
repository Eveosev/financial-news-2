Simon Penney,  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc ’s chief executive officer for the  Middle East 
and  Africa , resigned after 13 years at the bank.  Penney, based in Dubai, will be replaced by  James Miller 
from RBS’s debt business in the U.K., said a bank spokeswoman,
who asked not to be identified because of company policy. Penney
will leave after a significant handover period, she said.  RBS, Britain’s biggest taxpayer-owned lender, is the
seventh-ranked bond underwriter in the Middle East and North
Africa this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
lender plans to focus on areas including its debt and trade
finance businesses in the Middle East after deciding early last
year to exit its cash equities and mergers and acquisitions
business globally, Penney said in April.  Penney oversaw the sale of RBS’s retail banking business in
the United Arab Emirates, the second-biggest Arab economy, to
 Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB)  in 2010. It acquired the retail
business in 2007 as part of its takeover of ABN Amro Holding NV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
