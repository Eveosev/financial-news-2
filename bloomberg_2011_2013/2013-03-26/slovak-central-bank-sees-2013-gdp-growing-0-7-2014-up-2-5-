(Corrects 2014 figure in second paragraph.)  The Slovak central bank lowered its
2013 economic- growth  forecast to 0.7 percent from an earlier 1.6
percent forecast.  The projection for 2014 gross domestic product growth was
cut to 2.8 percent from a 3.5 percent predicted three months
ago, according to a quarterly forecast released by Governor
Jozef Makuch at a press conference today in the capital,
Bratislava. In 2015, the economy will probably expand 3.8
percent.  The export-dependent Slovak economy is hurt by the
lingering crisis in the euro area, which has depressed demand
from abroad. The revision reflects a worsened outlook for the
euro-sharing bloc, which the east European country joined in
2009, as well as rising unemployment.  The inflation rate this year is expected to be 1.9 percent,
while the rate in 2014 will be 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent in
2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
