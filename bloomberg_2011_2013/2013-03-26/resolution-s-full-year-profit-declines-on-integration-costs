Resolution Ltd. (RSL) , the insurance
buyout firm founded by  Clive Cowdery , said full-year profit fell
60 percent after the firm paid more for  information technology 
as it integrated businesses.  Operating profit declined to 274 million pounds ($416
million) in 2012 from 681 million pounds a year earlier, the
Guernsey, Channel Islands-based firm said today in a statement.
That missed the 336 million-pound median estimate of 8 analysts
 surveyed  by Bloomberg. The firm raised its full-year dividend by
6.3 percent.  Resolution is focusing on generating cash from its three
purchases --  Friends Provident , Axa SA’s U.K. life insurance
unit and Bupa Health Assurance Ltd. -- after abandoning its
acquisition strategy. The firm seeks to pay its dividend using
cash generated from its so-called back book unit, a pool of
existing policies closed to new customers that expire over time,
and grow by selling pensions to British companies.  “The group has made good operational and financial
progress in 2012 and, importantly, sustainable free surplus has
improved,” Chief Executive Officer-designate Andy Briggs said
in the statement.  Cash generation rose 3 percent to 300 million pounds in
2012. The firm raised its full-year dividend to 21.14 pence a
share and cancelled its scrip payout. The dividend is covered
117 percent by cash moved up to the parent company, Resolution
said.  Integration Costs  The firm’s net loss widened to 41 million pounds in 2012,
compared with 31 million pounds a year earlier. Resolution spent
124 million pounds on integrating its business units in 2012,
compared with 133 million pounds the previous year. The firm
also spent 76 million pounds relating to Solvency II regulations
and 41 million pounds on outsourcing.  Resolution’s  stock  is down about a third since it was
founded in 2008. The company’s initial strategy was hampered as
equity markets rallied in 2009, making acquisitions more
expensive.  Shareholders last week voted in favor of ending a
governance arrangement where Resolution outsourced the
management of the firm to a privately-held company named
Resolution Operations LLP, also owned by Cowdery. The Financial
Services Authority last year warned so-called externally managed
companies may lose their right to a listing on the stock
exchange if they fail to change their management structure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
