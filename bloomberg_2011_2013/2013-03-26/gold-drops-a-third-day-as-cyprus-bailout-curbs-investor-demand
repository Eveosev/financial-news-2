Gold fell for a third day in  London 
on speculation that a rescue for Cyprus will curb demand for the
metal as a protection of wealth.  Bullion fell to $1,589.87 an ounce yesterday, the lowest
since March 15, as Cyprus agreed on a bailout. European Central
Bank executive board member Benoit Coeure said the ECB will do
everything it can to preserve the currency and that the rescue
isn’t a model for the rest of the region. Mongolia and
Kazakhstan were among nations that raised gold reserves last
month, International Monetary Fund data show.  “A deal between Cyprus and European leaders has reduced
safe haven demand for gold,” Mumbai-based Kotak Commodity
Services Ltd. said today in a report. “Market players remain
concerned about health of euro-zone economy and this has limited
downside.”  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,596.43
by 10:15 a.m. in London. Futures for June delivery were 0.6
percent lower at $1,597.30 on the Comex in New York. Futures
trading volume was 14 percent above the average in the past 100
days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  While gold is heading for the first monthly gain since
September, the metal is still set for the first back-to-back
quarterly loss since 2001. Prices are down 4.7 percent this year
amid signs the U.S. economy is improving and as Federal Reserve
policy makers debated the pace of stimulus.  Mongolia’s gold reserves expanded 1.5 metric tons in
February and Kazakhstan’s holdings increased 4.9 tons, data on
the IMF’s website show. Azerbaijan and Ukraine also added to
reserves, while  Canada  and the Czech Republic reduced them.  Silver for immediate delivery was down 0.2 percent at
$28.7725 an ounce in London. Palladium fell 0.5 percent to
$753.95 an ounce. Platinum dropped 1 percent to $1,569.90 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
