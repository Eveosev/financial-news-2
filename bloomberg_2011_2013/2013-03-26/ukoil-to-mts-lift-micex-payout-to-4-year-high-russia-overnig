Russia ’s dividend yields are
soaring to a four-year high as companies from OAO Surgutneftegas
to OAO Lukoil bolster cash payouts to entice investors to the
cheapest stocks among  emerging markets .  Moscow’s  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  has an average dividend yield of 4
percent, the highest level since March 3, 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield for companies in the
Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
stocks in  New York  has more than doubled to 4.3 percent from 1.6
percent in July, the data show. RTS Index  futures  rose 0.7
percent in U.S. hours yesterday to 140,850.  Surgutneftegas offers a 12-month dividend yield of 9.8
percent on its preferred American depositary receipts, the most
among Russian U.S.-listed stocks, while Lukoil, whose Moscow
shares yield 5.9 percent, said this month that it will look at
boosting payouts from last year’s 23 percent of net income.
Russian stocks trade at 5.3 times estimated earnings, the
cheapest among 21 developing nations tracked by Bloomberg.  “Many companies are taking a course toward higher
dividends as Russian equities are extremely undervalued,”  Igor Nuzhdin, an analyst at Alfa Capital Management, which manages 80
billion rubles ($2.6 billion) of equities and fixed income, said
by phone from Moscow yesterday. “They try to lure investors,
give them some predictability and reduce their risks by
increasing dividends. Investors like dividends.”  Cash Pile  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, was unchanged at $27.46 yesterday
in New York, remaining at the lowest level since Nov. 28. The
RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
 stock futures , declined 2 percent to 20.15. The  Bloomberg-Russia
gauge (RUS14BN)  slipped 0.2 percent to 96.84, the lowest since Dec. 10.  Surgutneftegas is trading at a 32 percent discount to the
MSCI Emerging Markets Energy gauge, which includes producers
such as  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and PetroChina Co., data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Its preferred shares in Moscow have a 12-
month dividend yield of 10.2 percent.  Lukoil, the nation’s second-biggest oil producer after OAO
Rosneft, will consider boosting dividend payout ratios from next
year when investment demands ease, Chief Executive Officer  Vagit Alekperov  said in  London  on March 7. The Moscow-based company is
looking to boost shareholder payments to 30 percent of profit in
the medium term, he said.  In November, Russia approved regulations requiring state
companies to pay no less than 25 percent of their net income in
dividends.  ‘Increasing Attraction’  “Investment risks are high and it is natural that payouts
are increasing,” Alex Kantarovich, head of Russian equity
research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Moscow, said by e-mail
yesterday. “Among cash-rich companies, the government-
controlled corporations are known for paying too little, a drag
to their valuations. On the positive side we should highlight
the mobile operators, with dividend yields in the high single
digits, definitely increasing the attraction.”  Dividend yields are calculated by dividing annual dividends
per share by the price per share and expressing it as a
percentage.  Mobile TeleSystem (MBT) ’s board will meet next month to determine
the size of 2012 dividends, Chief Financial Officer Alexey Kornya said in Moscow on March 19. Management will propose
paying dividends of at least 18.3 rubles, or 59 U.S. cents, a
share, for a total of $1.2 billion, he said. MTS, as the company
is known, posted net income of $1 billion last year.  Sberbank’s Dividend  MTS’s ADRs climbed 0.3 percent to $20.58 in New York
yesterday, offering a 12-month dividend yield of 4.4 percent.
The ADRs settled at a 16 percent premium to the company’s
Moscow-listed shares, the biggest gap in a week. The company’s
Moscow stock offered 12-month dividend yield at 5.4 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  OAO  Sberbank (SBRCY) , in which the Russian central bank has a  50
percent  plus one share stake, will pay an “unprecedented”
dividend amounting to 17.3 percent of net income, Chief
Executive Officer Herman Gref said in Moscow on March 22.  ADRs of Sberbank, which held 46 percent of Russia’s retail
deposits at the end of 2012, rose 0.2 percent to $12.73 in New
York after reaching the lowest level this year on March 25. The
company’s 12-month dividend yield was at less than 2 percent.
Sberbank’s Moscow share, which offers 12-month gross dividend
yield of 2.1 percent, slipped 1.6 percent to 97.13 rubles, or
$3.14, in Moscow yesterday. Each ADR represents four shares.  Denizbank Offer  Turkey ’s  Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , owned by Sberbank, submitted the
sole offer for Citigroup Inc.’s Turkish retail unit after rivals
decided against bidding for the assets, two people familiar with
the matter said yesterday. Sberbank bought Denizbank in June
last year for $3.8 billion or 1.3 times book value. Sberbank
shareholders have voiced concerned whether the Citigroup deal is
needed after last year’s Denizbank acquisition, one of the
people said.  Ruble futures showed the currency weakening 0.2 percent to
31.95 per dollar in U.S. hours. Russia’s ruble advanced 0.2
percent to 30.852 per dollar yesterday and gained 0.2 percent to
34.8302 against the dollar-euro basket used by the central bank
to manage swings that erode exporter competitiveness.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 1.6 percent to $96.34 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the
highest settlement since Feb. 19. Brent oil for May settlement
increased 1.1 percent to $109.36 a barrel.  Urals crude , Russia’s
major export oil blend, fell 1 percent to $107.01 per barrel.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 2 percent to HK$3.94 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:28
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
