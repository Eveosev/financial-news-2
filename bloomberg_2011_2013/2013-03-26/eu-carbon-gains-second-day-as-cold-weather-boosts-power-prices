EU carbon permits for December rose
for the second day as electricity prices extended gains amid
declining wind power in  Germany  and forecasts for below-average
temperatures across the region.  Allowances for December delivery advanced as much as 9.1
percent to 4.90 euros ($6.30) a metric ton on ICE Futures
Europe, the highest since March 4. The contract closed at 4.62
euros a ton, an increase of 2.9 percent from yesterday.  Week-ahead power rose in France, the Nordic region and
Germany, where wind generation was forecast to peak at 10,500MW
at 3 p.m. Berlin time tomorrow, down 18 percent from today’s
peak of 12,776MW at 9:30 a.m. today. Temperatures in  London  are
forecast to be 0.6 degrees Celsius tomorrow, compared with a
seasonal norm of 8.3 degrees, according to MetraWeather data
using the ECMWF model on Bloomberg.  “Carbon was well supported today as energy commodities
strengthened on the back of the cold snap in  Europe ,” Milan
Hudak, an analyst at Virtuse Energy sro in  Prague , said by e-
mail.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
were unchanged at 33 euro cents a ton on ICE Futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
