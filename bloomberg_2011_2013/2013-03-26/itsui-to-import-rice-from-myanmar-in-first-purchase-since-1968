Mitsui & Co. (8031)  said it would import
5,000 metric tons of rice from Myanmar in Japan’s first purchase
of the grain from the Southeast Asian country in more than four
decades.  Japan’s second-largest trading company purchased the long-
grain rice for an import tender held by the agriculture ministry
for sales to producers of liquor and crackers, an official for
Tokyo-based Mitsui said by phone today. She asked not to be
identified because she isn’t authorized to make public
statements to the media.  Mitsui is considering investing 15 billion yen ($159
million) in Myanmar to build three rice-milling facilities
capable of processing 300,000 tons a year for shipments mainly
to the Middle East and Africa, she said.  Japan, self-sufficient in rice, agreed to give minimum-
 market access  to rice-exporting countries at the  Uruguay Round 
of world trade talks in 1993 by buying 770,000 tons a year.  The current purchase will be shipped from Yangon in May,
the official said. It will be the first purchase by Japan since
1968, she said.  The Financial Times and the Irrawaddy reported the
transaction earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
