Nigeria ,  Africa ’s largest oil
producer, will boost crude exports to 73 cargoes in May, a
partial loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  that includes
17 of 18 grades showed.  The nation plans to ship 11 consignments of Qua Iboe, nine
of Forcados, eight each of Bonny Light and Agbami, five each of
Akpo, Bonga and Brass River, four of Erha, three each of Amenam,
Escravos and Yoho, two lots of Abo, Antan and Okwori, and one
each of EA Blend, Okono and Pennington, according to the
schedules.  This is equivalent to 62 million barrels, or 2 million
barrels a day, versus 60.2 million, or 2 million a day,
scheduled for April.  That compares with the 66 shipments due to be exported next
month, a revised complete loading plan showed. Three Bonny Light
cargoes, two lots of Brass River and one Okono consignment have
been deferred from April to load in May.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  lifted a two-week force majeure on
Bonny Light exports on March 19. The country has been hit by
rising oil theft and the Nembe Creek Trunkline will close in
April to clear points along the link that are vulnerable to
thieves, according to Shell.  The May program for Usan wasn’t yet available. It totaled
five cargoes in April.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
