Brazil’s consumer-loan default rate
in February was the lowest in more than a year, even as interest
rates rose in the world’s second-biggest emerging market.  The consumer default rate fell to 7.7 percent from 7.9
percent in January, the central bank said in a report
distributed today in Brasilia. The rate was the lowest since
December 2011. The company loan default rate was unchanged at
3.7 percent.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has leaned on
banks to fuel both private consumption and new investments. In
the face of the slowest economic growth in three years, policy
makers have kept the benchmark  interest rate  at a record low
since October and encouraged banks to expand credit even amid
accelerating inflation. The implementation of Basel III
regulations announced earlier this month will reduce uncertainty
for local banks and have a neutral impact on credit expansion,
according to the central bank.  The state-controlled Caixa Economica Federal reported a 51
percent increase in lending to individuals through the end of
February, the bank said in a March 13 statement. Caixa’s lending
will expand as much as 39 percent this year, Raphael Rezende,
the bank’s vice-President for control and risk, said in a March
21 interview.  Gaining Speed  Recent economic indicators have exceeded economists’
forecasts, signaling that activity may be gaining speed.  Brazil 
created 123,446 jobs in February, compared to the median
estimate of a 95,148 increase. Retail sales in January rose by
0.6 percent, above the median forecast of a 0.4 percent
increase, while industrial output rose 2.5 percent, also beating
estimates.  Still, Brazil’s inflation has approached the upper limit of
the central bank’s target range, adding pressure on the bank to
raise interest rates. Annual inflation through mid-March  reached 
6.43 percent, jumping from 6.18 percent the previous month. The
central bank targets annual inflation at 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points.  Brazil’s average rate on loans rose in February to 26.4
percent from a revised 26.2 percent in January. Average rates on
consumer loans rose to 35.1 percent from a revised 34.6 percent
the month prior. Rates on corporate loans were unchanged at 18.9
percent.  Outstanding credit rose 0.7 percent in February from
January to 2.384 trillion reais ($1.187 trillion), the central
bank said today. Credit expanded 16.8 percent from a year ago.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 7.76 percent at 10:39 a.m. local time. The
real strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.0090 per  U.S. dollar .  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand by 3 percent
this year, according to the latest central bank survey of about
100 economists.  Latin America ’s largest economy grew by 0.9
percent and 2.7 percent in 2012 and 2011, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
