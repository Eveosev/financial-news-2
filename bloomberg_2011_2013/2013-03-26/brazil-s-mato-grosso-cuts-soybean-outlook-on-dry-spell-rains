Farmers in  Brazil ’s Mato Grosso
state will produce fewer soybeans than expected after a dry
spell was followed by rain at harvest time, researcher Instituto
Mato-Grossense de Economia Agropecuaria said.  The harvest in the state, the country’s biggest soybean
grower, is predicted to be 23.6 million metric tons, down from a
previous forecast of 24.1 million tons, Cuiaba, Brazil-based
IMEA wrote in an online  report  dated March 22. That compares
with last year’s crop of 21.4 million tons.  Farmers last year focused on planting soybeans as early as
possible, sowing after the first rains of September, IMEA wrote.
A dry spell after planting stunted growth in some parts of Mato
Grosso, while the return of rains in January and February
interfered with plans for an early harvest, it said.  “When comparing between regions, it seems the traditional
producers had the biggest reductions, weighing on the state
average,” IMEA wrote.  The state’s soybeans were 92.6 percent harvested as of
March 21, IMEA wrote, up from 85.2 percent a week earlier and
compared with 94.4 percent of the harvest completed a year ago.  The outlook for Mato Grosso soybean yields was cut to 49.8
60-kilogram bags (2.99 tons) per hectare (2.47 acres) from an
earlier outlook for 51 bags per hectare, and compared with 50
bags in 2012, according to IMEA.  For the Medio-Norte region that grows more than a third of
Mato Grosso’s soybeans, the outlook for yields was reduced to
49.8 bags per hectare from 52 bags, cutting expected production
to 9 million tons from 9.32 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
