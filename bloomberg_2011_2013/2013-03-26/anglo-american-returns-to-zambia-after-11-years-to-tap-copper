Anglo American Plc (AAL)  has returned to
Zambia, Africa’s biggest copper producer, to explore for the
metal after exiting the country 11 years ago.  Anglo is operating in northwestern Zambia where the
government granted it two exploration licenses in December,
 Pranill Ramchander , a spokesman for the London-based company,
said by e-mail.  Copper producers are looking to expand geographically after
 prices  for the metal, used in plumbing and wiring, more than
doubled in four years. Traditional mines have become depleted,
spurring companies to explore new areas or revisit former
locations to keep pace with demand growth.  “Anglo American sees Zambia as highly prospective for a
number of commodities but is currently only interested in
copper,” Ramchander said yesterday. The company is undertaking
early-stage reconnaissance and may drill this year, he said.  Anglo decided to sell its stake in Zambia’s Konkola Copper
Mines in 2002. The business was bought by Vedanta Resources Plc
in 2004.  Copper producers in Zambia include  Glencore International
Plc (GLEN) , Barrick Gold Corp., First Quantum Minerals Ltd. and
Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  has a copper
exploration joint venture in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
