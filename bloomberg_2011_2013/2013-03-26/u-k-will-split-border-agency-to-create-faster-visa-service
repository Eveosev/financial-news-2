The U.K. Border Agency will be
split into a visa-issuing body and an immigration-policing
organization after it struggled to deal with arrival lines at
airports and caused long waits for visas.  In a statement to Parliament in London today, Home
Secretary Theresa May said both the new bodies will be moved
back into the  Home Office , to be under her direct
responsibility, rather than being managed at arm’s length, as
UKBA was.  “What we have been doing is sorting out a chaotic
immigration system,” May told lawmakers. “It’s the approach
that’s going to deal with the problem that was caused by the
creation of this body by the last government.”  The visa service will focus on making it easier for people
to visit the U.K., taking quick decisions, May said. UKBA had a
backlog of 312,726 immigration cases in the three-month period
ending in September 2012, according to a  report published
yesterday  by Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee.  Keith Vaz, the Labour Party chairman of that committee,
praised May for a decision to put “the U.K. Backlogs Agency out
of its misery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
