German stocks  rose, halting a three
day retreat for the benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index, after better-than-
forecast U.S. durables-goods and housing data bolstered
confidence in the world’s largest economy.  Celesio AG (CLS1)  rallied the most in almost nine months after the
drug wholesaler reported an increase in earnings.
 HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  gained 4.3 percent as JPMorgan Chase & Co.
raised its profit forecast for the cement maker.  Adidas AG (ADS) 
gained 1.2 percent after the company said it is confident it
will reach its goals for 2015.  The DAX rose 0.1 percent to 7,879.67 at the close in
Frankfurt. The equity benchmark lost 1.6 percent in the past
three days as Cyprus negotiated bailout terms with the euro area
to help the island nation avoid bankruptcy. The broader HDAX
Index added 0.2 percent today.  “U.S. data has generally been better than the  euro zone ,”
said Ioan Smith, a strategist at Knight Capital Europe Ltd. in
 London .  Even so “the worst of the effects of the sequester
have yet to be felt, making this the period of greatest risk to
the momentum of the  U.S. economy .”  Today’s report showed a 5.7 percent increase U.S. durable
goods for February, the most since September, propelled by
automobiles and a rebound in commercial aircraft. That beat the
median economist forecast for a 3.9 percent advance. Separate
data showed  house prices  in 20 U.S. cities climbed 8.1 percent
in January, the biggest 12-month gain since June 2006. That also
exceeded the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Stocks briefly erased gains and the euro fell after Reuters
reported that the European Parliament will push for bank
depositors with more than 100,000 euros ($129,000) to face
losses. The  news agency  cited lawmaker Gunnar Hokmark.  Lower Volume  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the DAX
were limited ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Trading today was
20 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Celesio climbed 4 percent to 14.50 euros, the most since
June 29, after the company reported a 4.5 percent increase in
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
excluding some costs, to 579.6 million euros in 2012. Celesio
had predicted that profit would at least match the 2011 level.  Earnings Estimate  HeidelbergCement rallied 4.3 percent to 56.40 euros,
climbing for the first time in four days. JPMorgan upgraded its
2013 earnings-per-share estimate by 6 percent to account for
foreign-exchange effects and lower interest changes. The
brokerage also raised its price estimate by 27 percent to 58.80
euros, saying the stock is benefiting from a “reasonably
positive outlook for 2013.”  A separate report by UBS AG said fundamentals for the
cement industry are improving, saying pricing dynamics have
“improved significantly to recover some lost gross margins.”  Adidas advanced 1.2 percent to 82.31 euros after Chief
Executive Officer  Herbert Hainer  said in an interview with
France’s Le Figaro newspaper that the company had “excellent”
elements to help it reach goals.  Rheinmetall AG (RHM)  dropped 4.4 percent to 36.15 euros after
Deutsche Bank AG lowered its recommendation for the engineering
company to sell from hold, saying its full-year outlook last
week disappointed investors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
