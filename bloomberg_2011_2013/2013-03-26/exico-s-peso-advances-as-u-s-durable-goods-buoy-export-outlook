Mexico ’s peso advanced to an 18-
month high after orders for U.S. durable goods climbed more than
economists forecast, bolstering the outlook for the Latin
American nation’s biggest export market.  The peso climbed 0.2 percent to 12.3272 per U.S. dollar at
7:44 a.m. in Mexico City after touching 12.3079, the strongest
intraday level since September 2011. The currency has risen 4.3
percent this year, the most among the dollar’s 16 major
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg, after an 8.4 percent rally in
2012.  Orders for goods meant to last at least three years,
including automobiles and commercial aircraft, rose 5.7 percent
in February, a Commerce Department report showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 80 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 3.9 percent advance. Mexico sends about
80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  “It’s in part the data,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency
trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico.
“We’re extending the rally on a thin market ahead of the
holidays.”  Mexico’s stock market will be closed March 28 and March 29
for Easter holidays.  Yields on government peso bonds due in 2024 were little
changed at to 5.04 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 0.12 centavo to 143.78 centavos per
peso.  Mexico’s central bank is scheduled to release its report on
international reserves at 9 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
