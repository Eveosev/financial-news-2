South Africa  will invest about $1.5
billion of its gold and foreign-currency reserves in  China ’s
interbank bond market, the central bank said.  Representatives from the two nations’ central banks today
signed an agreement enabling the South African Reserve Bank to
invest about 3 percent of its reserves of $50.4 billion in
Chinese assets, the Pretoria-based bank said in a statement on
its website.  The  People’s Bank of China  this month issued rules on
qualified foreign institutional investors’ participation in its
interbank bond market aimed at expanding investment channels.
The central bank of Africa’s biggest economy in July said it was
considering adding China’s  yuan  as one of its reserve currencies
because of increasing trade between the two nations.  “It’s a question of expanding our current basket, it’s not
replacing what we’re doing with the dollar,” Hlengani Mathebula, a spokesman for South  Africa ’s central bank, said in
a phone interview. “Assuming our reserves are higher, it’s
possible we could exceed the amount” of $1.5 billion, he said.  China is South Africa’s biggest buyer of raw materials and
its largest trading partner, purchasing 13 percent of the
country’s exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
