Mongolia raised its  gold reserves 
for a third month to the highest in more than four years in
February as the metal capped its longest monthly losing streak
since 1997.  The country’s holdings expanded 1.5 metric tons to 5.8
tons, the most since August 2008, according to the International
Monetary Fund’s website. Kazakhstan’s holdings increased 4.9
tons, Azerbaijan’s climbed 1 ton and Ukraine’s rose 0.6 ton, the
data show. Canada’s reserves dropped 0.1 ton, the  Czech Republic 
cut them by 0.2 ton and Mexico’s holdings fell 0.1 ton.  Nations added 534.6 tons to reserves last year, the most
since 1964, even as prices averaged a record $1,669 an ounce,
the London-based World Gold Council said last month. Bullion
slid for five consecutive months through February and investors
sold metal from exchange-traded products this year amid signs
the  U.S. economy  is improving and as Federal Reserve policy
makers debated the pace of stimulus. Gold is trading 17 percent
below its September 2011 record of $1,921.15.  “Given the depreciation rates of the major currencies in
the world and the debt crisis, especially in the  euro zone ,
there’s definitely a lot of room to buy gold,”  Daniel Briesemann , a commodities analyst at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt, said today by phone. “The percentage of gold in
currency reserves is still very low in  emerging markets , so
there’s a lot of catch-up potential to the industrialized
countries.”  Russia’s Reserves  Russia raised its gold reserves by 7 tons to 976.9 tons,
according to the IMF data. The country’s central bank said
earlier this month that it raised holdings by about that much.
Turkey’s reserves climbed 5.7 tons to 375.7 tons, the data show.
Its holdings have increased due to it accepting gold in its
 reserve requirements  from commercial banks.  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.5 percent $1,596.85 by
9:42 a.m. in London, extending its decline this year to 4.7
percent. The metal rallied for a 12th straight year in 2012 as
nations from the U.S. to China pledged more stimulus to bolster
economies and as investors sought an alternative to currencies.  Gold accounts for about 4.7 percent of Mongolia’s total
reserves and about 23 percent of  Kazakhstan ’s, according to the
World Gold Council. That compares with more than 70 percent for
the U.S. and Germany, the biggest bullion holders, the data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
