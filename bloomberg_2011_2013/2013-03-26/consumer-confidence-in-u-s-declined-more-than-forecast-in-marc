Confidence among U.S. consumers
fell more than forecast in March as Washington’s budget battle
soured Americans’ views of the economic outlook.  The Conference Board’s  index  declined to 59.7 from a
revised three-month high of 68 in February, data from the New
York-based private research group showed today. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg projected the March measure would fall to
67.5.  “This is really quite a big hit,” said  Ian Shepherdson ,
chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors Inc. in  White
Plains ,  New York , who projected a reading of 63. “The longer
confidence stays down and the further it falls, the more chance
that it will be reflected in weaker spending.”  Concern mounted that sweeping cuts in planned  government
spending  may hinder the expansion and limit recent progress in
the labor market. At the same time, a rally in stocks and a
housing rebound that’s helping shore up household balance sheets
may help keep consumer purchases, which account for about 70
percent of the economy, from slumping.  Stocks held gains after the report, with the  Standard &
Poor’s  500 index climbing 0.6 percent to 1,560.51 at 10:34 a.m.
in New York.  Economists’ Projections  Forecasts of 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg ranged
from 60 to 72. The measure averaged 53.7 in the recession that
ended in June 2009.  Another report today showed  home prices  in 20 U.S. cities
jumped in the 12 months to January by 8.1 percent, the biggest
year-to-year gain since June 2006 and a sign the housing-market
recovery is strengthening. The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of
property values climbed 1 percent from December.  The Commerce Department said sales of new homes in February
capped the best back-to-back months in more than four years.
Purchases of newly built homes fell 4.6 percent to a 411,000
annualized  pace , following a 431,000 rate in the prior month.  The Conference Board’s gauge of consumer  present conditions 
dropped to 57.9 in March from 61.4 in February. The measure of
 expectations  for the next six months decreased to 60.9 from
72.4.  Those expecting business conditions to improve in the next
six months declined to 14.4 percent in March, the smallest share
since November 2011, from 18 percent the prior month.  “The recent sequester has created uncertainty regarding
the economic outlook and as a result, consumers are less
confident,” said  Lynn Franco , director of economic indicators
at the Conference Board, said in a statement.  Jobs Outlook  The share of consumers expecting more jobs to become
available in the next six months slumped to 12.3 percent in
March, the worst reading since October 2011, from 16.1 percent
in February.  The share of respondents who expect an increase in their
income in the next six months fell to 13.7 percent from 15.8
percent the prior month.  The number of respondents who said jobs are currently
plentiful fell to 9.4 percent in March from 10.1 percent.  Other measures of  consumer confidence  have been mixed. The
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort monthly gauge of expectations
improved to minus 4 in March from minus 7 in February, according
to results of the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index. The weekly
measure fell for the first time in seven weeks, to minus 33.9
from minus 31.6.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer  sentiment  decreased in March to 71.8 from 77.6
the prior month, as Americans’ expectations deteriorated.  Payroll Tax  Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI) , whose brands include the Olive
Garden and Red Lobster, is among companies seeing signs of a
pickup in household spending after 2 percentage-point increase
in the tax that funds  Social Security . The levy means Americans
earning $50,000 a year are taking home about $80 less a month.  “The consumers just weren’t prepared, despite all the
conversation, for the  payroll tax  increase, and there was a
pretty rapid spike up in gasoline prices,” Clarence Otis,
chairman and chief executive officer of Darden, said on a March
22 earnings call. “But March indicates that consumers have
adjusted.”  A pickup in the labor market may help sustain sentiment and
spending. Employers hired a net 236,000 workers last month
following gains of 119,000 in January, Labor Department figures
show. That helped to push the  unemployment rate  down to 7.7
percent, its lowest level since December 2008.  Fuel prices are also stabilizing after rising since mid-
December. The price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was
$3.67 on March 24, down from $3.79 at the end of February,
according to AAA, the largest U.S. motoring group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
