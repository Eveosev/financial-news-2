The U.S.’s net international
investment position stayed in deficit at the end of 2012 as
American holdings abroad weakened in value and foreign-owned
assets in the U.S. gained, Commerce Department data showed.  U.S.-owned assets overseas totaled $20.8 trillion compared
with $21.1 trillion a year earlier while foreign-held
investments rose $13.7 billion to $25.2 trillion, leaving a
shortfall of $4.42 trillion, the report released in
 Washington  today showed. The deficit at the end of 2011 was
$4.03 trillion, according to the data.  The department released the series for the first time
today, saying in a statement that said it’s intended to improve
understanding of “cross-border linkages to help users better
assess U.S. vulnerability to external financial shocks in the
aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
