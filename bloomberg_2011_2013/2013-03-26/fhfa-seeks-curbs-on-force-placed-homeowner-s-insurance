The regulator of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, aiming to protect homeowners from price-gouging on
insurance, wants to ban fees and commissions on policies that
borrowers are compelled to buy when their own coverage lapses.  The Federal Housing Finance Agency proposed curbs on so-
called force-placed insurance practices that drive up costs for
consumers, according to a statement today. The FHFA would stop
insurers from paying mortgage companies that send them such
business and other practices that create a conflict of interest,
according to the statement.  Force-placed insurance is designed to protect lenders and
mortgage investors when a homeowner stops paying premiums for
property insurance. A lender can force the customer to take out
a new policy from an insurer typically selected by the bank,
which may get paid for referring the business, and the rates may
be higher than those available in the open market.  California, Florida and  New York  regulators have pressed
insurers to cut premiums on force-placed policies amid inquiries
into whether they charge too much.  The FHFA will seek public comment for 60 days and plans to
offer guidance regarding these practices to sellers and
servicers four months after that, according to today’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
