Russian  shares  fell to the lowest
level in more than three months as Cyprus’s bailout plan cast
doubt on the safety of $60 billion of loans and deposits in the
island nation.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  retreated for a third day, slipping 0.8
percent to 1,417.00 by the close in Moscow, the lowest level
since Dec. 4. Utilities and consumer goods stocks led the
decline, down at least 3 percent on average. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index slid 0.9 percent to 1,445.46.  Cyprus agreed to shut its second-largest bank and tax
deposits of more than 100,000 euros ($129,000) yesterday after
lawmakers rejected an earlier plan. The new deal is “clearly
worse” for  Russia , Bank of America Merrill Lynch said
yesterday, reducing its recommendation on the nation’s equities
to neutral.  “Russian markets continue to be negatively affected by
Cyprus,” Sergey Fundobny, head of research at Arbat Capital in
Moscow, said by phone today. “The bailout bears anti-Russian
characteristics since the majority of  bank deposits  consists of
Russian money. Under such bailout conditions, foreign investors
will be staying away from Russian assets.”  Russian lenders and companies had about $31 billion in
Cypriot banks by the end of 2012, according to a March 18
Moody’s Investors Service report, while another $29 billion has
been given in loans to Cypriot firms with origins in Russia. The
benchmark Micex Index recorded its steepest decline since May
last week following a proposal to tax savings accounts to secure
a 10-billion euro bailout from the euro area.  Low Valuations  Morgan Stanley (MS)  recommended buying Russian stocks, citing
lower valuations relative to emerging-market peers, according to
an e-mailed note today.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.3
times estimated earnings after losing 3.9 percent this year.
That compares with a multiple of 10.5 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index, which has dropped 2.6 percent this year.  OAO MRSK Holding tumbled 4.1 percent to 1.579 rubles, while
OAO Inter RAO UES declined 4.6 percent to 1.79 kopeks. OAO
 Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest coking coal producer, retreated as much
as 4.8 percent before falling 2.5 percent to 154.20 rubles.  OAO Novolipetsk Steel, the Russian steelmaker controlled by
billionaire  Vladimir Lisin , lost 4.7 percent to 47.58 rubles,
the lowest level since April 2009. The number of shares traded
was about 9.7 million, equivalent to about twice the stock’s
three-month average.  The steelmaker sees first-quarter earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization “sequentially lower” and
revenue dropping 5 percent, it said in a regulatory filing
today.  Oil Advances  Bank  St. Petersburg  dropped 3.4 percent to 36.66 rubles,
the lowest since May 2009. The bank’s 2012 net income fell to
1.3 billion rubles, compared with 5.9 billion rubles a year
earlier, the lender said in a statement on its website today.  The Russian Depositary Index retreated 0.6 percent to
1,635.48.  OAO Severstal (SVST) ’s depositary receipts led the decline,
losing 5.3 percent.  Crude prices rose 0.6 percent to $95.41 per barrel in  New
York , increasing for a third day. Oil and gas contribute about
50 percent of Russia’s state revenue. Standard & Poor’s GSCI
 Index of Commodities  added 0.2 percent to 650.46.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, fell 0.5 percent to $27.32 in New
York, heading for its lowest level since Nov. 16. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the  stock
futures , declined 6.3 percent to 20.56.  To contact the reporter on this story:
