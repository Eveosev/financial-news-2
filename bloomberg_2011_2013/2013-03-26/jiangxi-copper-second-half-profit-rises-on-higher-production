Jiangxi Copper  Co., China’s largest
producer of the metal, recorded a 10 percent increase in second-
half profit as higher copper production outweighed a drop in
prices of the metal.  Net income was 2.5 billion  yuan  ($402 million) in the six
months ended Dec. 31, from the 2.27 billion yuan a year earlier.
The result was derived by deducting six-month figures from full-
year earnings released today in a statement.  The company’s production capacity of copper concentrates
rose 33 percent to 224,000 metric tons after mine expansions in
2010 and 2011 helped to boost earnings, BOCOM International Ltd.
analyst Benjamin Pei said in a note dated March 8. Average
prices of the metal in  London  fell 5.3 percent in the second
half of last year from a year earlier.  Jiangxi Copper fell 0.7 percent to close at HK$16.92 in
Hong Kong today before the earnings announcement. The benchmark
 Hang Seng Index  climbed 0.3 percent.  Full-year profit fell to 5.17 billion yuan, the statement
said. The earnings beat the 5.16 billion yuan mean estimate of
18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Copper consumption in China will jump 8 percent to a record
8.833 million metric tons this year, boosting global demand and
creating a 6,000-ton deficit, compared with a surplus of 216,000
tons in 2012, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The momentum
of demand growth is strong with China’s urbanization process,
 Jiangxi Copper (58) ’s Chairman Li Baomin said March 5 in Beijing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
