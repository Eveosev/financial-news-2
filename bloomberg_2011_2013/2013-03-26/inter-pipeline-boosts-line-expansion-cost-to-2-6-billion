Inter Pipeline Fund (IPL-U) , a Calgary-
based oil-sands pipeline company, increased the cost of an
Alberta system expansion 18 percent and said it has enough
customer support to move forward with the C$2.6 billion ($2.6
billion) project.  FCCL Partnership, a venture between  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  and
 ConocoPhillips (COP) , agreed to become a customer of the project,
which includes 840 kilometers (520 miles) new pipelines, the
company said in a statement today. Inter Pipeline will provide
FCCL with 500,000 barrels a day of bitumen blend capacity and
350,000 barrels of capacity for diluent, a material that helps
the oil-sands product flow by pipeline.  The project, which the company estimated would cost C$2.2
billion in January, will link to existing oil-sands projects at
Foster Creek and Christina Lake as well as Narrows Lake, which
is currently being developed. The new infrastructure will be
operational for the first two areas in mid 2014 and facilities
for Narrows Lake will be available in mid 2017, Inter Pipeline
said.  Production from  Canada â€™s oil sands is expected to more than
double by 2021 to 3.38 million barrels a day, according to the
 Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers . Demand for diluent
and other condensates will probably more than double to 700,000
barrels a day by the end of the decade from 310,000 last year,
according to a forecast from ITG Investment Research on Monday.  Inter Pipeline fell 4 cents to C$23.57 at the close in
Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
