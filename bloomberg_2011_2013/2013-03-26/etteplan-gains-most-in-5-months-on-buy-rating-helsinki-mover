Etteplan Oyj (ETT1V) , a Finnish machine
technology designer, rose the most in five months in Helsinki
trading after Inderes Oy gave the stock a buy rating.  Etteplan gained as much as 5.5 percent, the most since Oct.
25, and traded 14 cents higher at 3.25 euros, as of 3:06 p.m. in
the Finnish capital. The number of shares traded was more than
double the daily average over the past three months.  Inderes, a Helsinki-based equity researcher, started
coverage with a buy rating and an estimate for the shares to
rise to 3.60 euros in 12 months. The company has long-lasting
client relationships and low costs because of its China
operations, Juha Kinnunen, an Inderes analyst, said in a note.  “We think Etteplan shares are undervalued both in absolute
terms and in relation to their peers,” he said. “That will be
corrected when markets observe the low valuation.”  Etteplan signed a framework agreement with Ensto Oy on
technical engineering and product information services today.  The shares are up 22 percent this year, valuing the
Hollola-based company at 66 million euros ($85 million).  The company will hold its annual general meeting tomorrow
in Vantaa,  Finland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
