Palm oil  fell for a second day on
speculation that stockpiles in Malaysia, the world’s second-
biggest producer after  Indonesia , may climb as exports decline.  The contract for delivery in June dropped as much as 1.1
percent to 2,436 ringgit ($787) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning session at 2,438
ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Futures gained 3.3 percent last week,
closing at 2,493 ringgit, the highest price since Feb. 22.  Exports from Malaysia fell 7.5 percent to 1.07 million tons
in the first 25 days of this month from the same period in
February, surveyor Intertek said yesterday. Shipments had been
11 percent higher during the first 20 days of the month,
according to the surveyor. Inventories were 2.44 million tons in
February after reaching a record 2.63 million tons in December,
according to Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  “Prices are falling on expectation that the inventories
will start to move up again by the end of May,” Ryan Long, a
vice president of futures and options at OSK Investment Bank
Bhd., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur . “I don’t expect any kind
of exceptional Malaysian exports. Even with a higher tax
Indonesia still manages to sell the oil at a cheaper price.”  Stockpiles will be more than 2 million tons at the end of
March as production may expand, he said.  Soybean oil  for May delivery dropped 0.3 percent to 50.31
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
May was little changed at $14.365 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery fell 0.6 percent to
6,376 yuan ($1,026) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month was little changed at
8,098  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
