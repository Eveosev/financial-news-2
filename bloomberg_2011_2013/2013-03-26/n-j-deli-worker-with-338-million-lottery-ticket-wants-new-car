A 45-year-old bodega worker from
Passaic,  New Jersey , held the winning $338 million Powerball
ticket sold at a liquor store, lottery officials said.  Pedro Quezada, who moved to the U.S. from the  Dominican
Republic  at 19, has said he’ll take a lump-sum payment of
$151,931,117 after taxes, said Carole Hedinger, executive
director of the New Jersey Lottery. Quezada, a married father of
five, said his first plan is to buy a “good car.”  “My life has changed,” he said through a translator today
at lottery headquarters in Lawrenceville. “It’s changed because
it’s so much money, but it won’t change my heart.”  Quezada, who was joined at the news conference by his wife,
Ines Sanchez, and several relatives, said he doesn’t plan to
return to the store, which he said opens at 5 a.m. and closes at
11 p.m. Quezada owned the store before selling it last year,
according to lottery officials.  The ticket was issued at Eagle Liquors in Passaic, Hedinger
told reporters yesterday. Quezada, who said he plays the lottery
two or three times a week, won by using the “quick pick”
method, meaning his numbers were chosen automatically.  The March 23 drawing also had one $1 million winning
ticket, sold in Mahwah, and five tickets that each will pay
$10,000, according to a news release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
