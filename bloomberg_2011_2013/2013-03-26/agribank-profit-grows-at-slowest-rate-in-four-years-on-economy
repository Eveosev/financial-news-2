Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. ,
the nationâ€™s third-largest lender by market value, posted its
weakest annual profit growth in four years as the  economy 
slowed.  Net income  rose 19 percent to 145.1 billion  yuan  ($23
billion) in 2012, or 0.45 yuan a share, from 121.9 billion yuan,
or 0.38 yuan a share, a year earlier, the Beijing-based lender
said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. That
compares with the 148.7 billion-yuan average  estimate  of 30
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
