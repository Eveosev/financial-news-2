Malaysia’s ringgit gained for a
fourth day on speculation that inflows into Asia’s  emerging
markets  will increase as bank bailouts put European savings at
risk. Government bonds were steady.  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades agreed yesterday to
shut the country’s second-largest bank and impose a tax on
deposits of more than 100,000 euros to secure a 10 billion-euro
($13 billion) bailout. The ringgit will benefit also from
Malaysia’s “diligent” monetary policy which is supporting the
nation’s exports, according to Barclays Plc.  “If you are a European deposit holder who’s lucky enough
to have 100,000 euros, you may well be looking for a new home
for that money,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist
at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Singapore “Europe’s pain is
potentially Asia’s gain.”  The ringgit climbed 0.1 percent to 3.0973 per dollar as of
9:35 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in exchange rates used to price options, was steady at
6.94 percent.  The yield on 3.26 percent sovereign bonds due March 2018
was 3.23 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
