The city of  West Palm Beach ,
Florida, has no plans to restart a $37 million wastewater
treatment plant that hasn’t run since September, according to
The Palm Beach Post.  The facility opened in 2006 and cost as much as $2.5
million annually to operate, the newspaper reported yesterday.
The plant, which “was plagued with problems” and endured
“lengthy shutdowns blamed on poor design and inadequately
trained city workers” may be converted to process sewage for
irrigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
