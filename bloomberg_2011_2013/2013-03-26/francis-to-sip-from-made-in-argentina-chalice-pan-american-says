Pan American Silver Corp. (PAA) , the
Canadian miner that wrote down $100 million on an Argentine
project last quarter, will supply silver from the South American
country to make Pope Francis’s chalice.  A 1.3-kilogram (2.9-pound) bar of 99.9 percent pure silver
will be supplied for the chalice, Vancouver-based  Pan American 
spokeswoman Kettina Cordero said in an e-mailed response to
questions. The metal will come from Pan American’s Triton
venture in the southern province of  Santa Cruz , she said,
confirming a March 23 report by Argentine news agency Telam.  Pan American, the world’s second largest primary silver
producer, had a $100 million non-cash writedown at the Navidad
deposit in Chubut province in the fourth quarter, reducing its
book value to $500 million because of the “general
deterioration and increased risks of doing business in
Argentina,” Chief Executive Officer Geoffrey Burns said Feb.
21. The company acquired Navidad in 2010 and has been waiting
for the Chubut government to approve an open-pit mining law to
develop it since then.  Argentine-born Pope Francis, formerly Cardinal Jorge
Bergoglio, was elected the first non-European pope on March 13.
He has since dismissed certain papal traditions, such as the use
of a motorcade and using a white cassock, in line with the image
of humility he projected as a cardinal, which included riding
the subway in  Buenos Aires .  To contact the reporter on this story:
