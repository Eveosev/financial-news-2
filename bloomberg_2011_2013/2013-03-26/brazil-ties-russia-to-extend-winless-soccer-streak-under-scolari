Brazil  drew 1-1 with Russia to stay
winless since Luiz Felipe Scolari returned for his second spell
as coach of the record five-time soccer world champion.  Fred’s last-minute goal rescued a draw for next year’s
World Cup host in an exhibition match played at Chelsea’s
 Stamford  Bridge stadium in London last night. Victor Fayzulin
put Russia ahead in the 73rd minute.  Brazil is winless through five games for the first time
since 2001, when Scolari also was coach of the national team.
Brazil secured its fifth World Cup title the following year.  Since Scolari returned to the job Nov. 29, the Brazilians
have also lost to England and drawn against  Italy .  Scolari’s team is playing a series of exhibition matches,
billed as the Brazil World Tour, to prepare for next year’s 32-
nation World Cup, which it doesn’t have to qualify for. It next
visits Bolivia on April 4.  Next year’s global championship is scheduled from June 12
to July 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
