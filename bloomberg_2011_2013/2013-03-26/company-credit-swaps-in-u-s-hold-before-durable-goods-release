A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk held before reports that may show durable-goods orders grew
and new-home sales remained near a four-year high.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
0.3 basis point to a mid-price of 90.8 basis points at 7:58 a.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  A report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  may show that U.S.
 durable-goods orders  increased 3.9 percent in February, the most
in five months, according to the median economist forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. At 10 a.m., the Commerce Department may report
that  new homes  sold at a 420,000 annual pace last month after a
437,000 January rate, the best back-to-back performance in four
years, according to a separate Bloomberg survey. Improving
economic data may ease investor concern about companiesâ€™ ability
to repay debt.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
