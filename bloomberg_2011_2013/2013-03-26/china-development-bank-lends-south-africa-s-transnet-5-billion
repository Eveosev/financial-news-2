The China Development Bank Corp.
agreed to lend Transnet SOC Ltd.,  South Africa ’s state-owned
ports and rail operator, about $5 billion to support the
country’s infrastructure development.  The “financial and non-financial assistance” will run
over five years, according to a statement from South  Africa ’s
government.  “The agreement will enable us to explore innovative
funding options as we pursue our borrowing plan focusing on cost
effective solutions and diversity,” Transnet Chief Executive
Officer Brian Molefe said in a separate e-mailed statement.  Transnet started a seven-year, 300 billion-rand ($32.4
billion) development plan across Africa’s biggest economy and
neighboring commodity-producing countries last year. Growth has
been stunted by insufficient capacity at South Africa’s ports
and railways.  To contact the reporter on this story:
