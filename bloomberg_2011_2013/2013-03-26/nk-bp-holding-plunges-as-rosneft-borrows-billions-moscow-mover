OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP)  fell the most on
record in Moscow trading after new owner OAO Rosneft said it may
borrow funds from the oil producer, raising concern it may scrap
dividends.  The  stock  slumped as much as 25 percent, the biggest
decline since starting to trade in December 2010. It was down 23
percent at 37.17 rubles as of 6:01 p.m. local time.  The company is the traded unit of TNK-BP, which was bought
by Moscow-based Rosneft last week. Its new parent approved a
borrowing limit of $10 billion from TNK-BP’s affiliated
businesses, including about 114 billion rubles ($3.7 billion)
from TNK-BP Holding and two of its units, a filing showed today.  “This is not an encouraging precedent for TNK-BP Holding
shareholders,”  Alexei Kokin , an oil and gas analyst at UralSib
Financial Corp., said by e-mail. The loans may mean Rosneft is
gaining access to TNK-BP Holding’s cash by means other than
dividends, he said.  Rosneft became the world’s largest oil producer by output
when it closed its $55 billion acquisition of TNK-BP from  BP Plc (BP/) 
and a group of billionaires. A Rosneft official said today that
so-called cash-pulling is a standard practice.  It “permits the effective management of available
liquidity,” the official said by e-mail, asking not to be
identified, citing company policy.  Rosneft Chief Executive Officer  Igor Sechin  said last week
that the state-run oil producer won’t buy shares held by
minorities in TNK-BP Holding. He said last October that TNK-BP’s
dividend policy may be terminated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
