The  Miami Heat  extended the second-
longest winning streak in National Basketball Association
history to 27 by opening a four-game road trip with a 108-94
victory against the Orlando Magic.  LeBron James had 24 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds
for the Heat, who were tied 68-68 with just over two minutes
left in the third quarter in Orlando before taking control with
a 20-2 scoring run. James had 18 points in the second half.  Miami improved its record to 56-14 and pulled within six
wins of matching the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers’ 33-game winning
streak, the longest in league history.  Mario Chalmers  added 17 points for the Heat, who again
played without  Dwyane Wade  because of a sore right knee.  The Heat next play tomorrow in Chicago against the Bulls
(37-31) before visiting the New Orleans Hornets (24-46) on March
29 and the San Antonio Spurs (53-16) two days later. Miami
hasn’t lost since Feb. 3.  “We’ve been playing in a lot of competitive games over
this streak, so we look forward to going to Chicago and playing
against a very well-coached, defensive-minded team,” James said
in a televised interview. “We’ll be ready for it and look
forward to the challenge.”  Miami’s winning streak is the second-longest in the four
major U.S. professional sports. The Heat had been tied with
 Major League Baseball ’s  New York  Giants, who also won 26 games
in a row during the 1916 season.  The Heat continued their run on the same night the  Denver
Nuggets  had their streak of 15 straight NBA wins end with a 110-
86 road loss to the Hornets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
