Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards fell to
the weakest level since January after overseas investors sold
the nation’s assets on concern about the government’s plan to
adjust fuel subsidies. Two-year sovereign bonds advanced.  Foreign holdings of local-currency  debt  fell 1.6 trillion
rupiah ($164 million) to 283.3 trillion rupiah as of March 22,
compared with a record 284.9 trillion rupiah on March 14,
according to government data. Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo 
said last week that measures to manage fuel usage are being
considered and price increases haven’t been ruled out.  “The longer the delay and as the uncertainty remains, the
higher the chance that inflation will have picked up already,
and prices tend to be sticky and not move downward,” said
Eugene Leow, an economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in
 Singapore . “It would be better to have a clearer direction of
where the policy is headed.”  Rupiah one-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.2
percent to 9,811 per dollar as of 9:42 a.m. in Jakarta, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. They reached 9,825 earlier, the
lowest level since Jan. 31. The contracts traded at a 0.6
percent discount to the spot rate, which declined 0.1 percent to
9,745, prices from local banks show.  Bond Sale  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,741 yesterday by the Association of Banks in Singapore,
compared with 9,750 on March 22. Today’s rate will be published
at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.85 percent.  Foreign investors sold $98 million more Indonesian shares
than they bought yesterday, exchange data show, even as the
Jakarta Composite Index climbed 1.2 percent, the biggest
increase in more than two weeks. It gained 0.8 percent today.  Consumer prices rose 5.31 percent last month, the most
since June 2011, driven by food and electricity costs. March
data are due on April 1.  The  Finance Ministry  is due to sell 7 trillion rupiah of
debt today with maturities ranging from one to 20 years. The
yield on the 11 percent notes due in October 2014 dropped one
basis point to 4.29 percent, the lowest level since March 11,
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The rate
on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 was little changed at
5.47 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
