The euro traded within 0.3 percent
of a four-month low versus the dollar as concerns that debt-
crisis contagion will spread threatened to sap confidence in the
17-nation currency bloc.  The shared currency remained lower for a second day after
dropping 1.1 percent on March 25 as  Italy  prepared to auction as
much as 7 billion euros ($9 billion) of bonds, and ahead of data
forecast to show continued weakness in euro-area consumer
sentiment.  “You’ve still got outstanding issues that need to be dealt
with” in the currency bloc, said  Joseph Capurso , a Sydney-based
foreign-exchange strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) ,
the nation’s biggest lender. “You’ve still got an economy that
is in recession. That’s likely to keep the euro heavy.”  The euro was little changed at $1.2862 as of 8:12 a.m. in
Tokyo from yesterday, when it touched $1.2829, the lowest since
Nov. 22. It rose 0.2 percent to 121.75 yen. Japan’s currency
fell 0.2 percent to 94.66 per dollar.  Italy auctions as much as 4 billion euros of notes maturing
in 2018 today, and up to 3 billion euros of 10-year bonds. The
euro area’s fourth-biggest economy auctioned 2.8 billion euros
of 2014 zero-coupon bonds this week at a yield of 1.746 percent,
the highest since Dec. 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
