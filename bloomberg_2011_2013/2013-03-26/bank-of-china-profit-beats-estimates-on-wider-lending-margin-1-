China ’s largest banks posted a
decline in bad-loan ratios for 2012 amid the slowest  economic
expansion  in 13 years, signaling policy makers may have averted
a surge in defaults.  The gauge shrank to 1.33 percent at  Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd. , the nation’s third-largest by market value, from
1.55 percent in 2011, while net income increased by 19 percent,
the Beijing-based lender said yesterday. At  Bank of China Ltd. ,
the fourth-largest, non-performing loans dropped to 0.95 percent
of the total from 1 percent, and profit climbed 12 percent.  Shares of both banks rose today as the shrinking bad-loan
ratios assuaged investors’ concern that earnings could slip this
year amid defaults by borrowers including solar manufacturer
Suntech Power Holdings Co. China’s economic growth may
accelerate to 8.1 percent this quarter, according to the median
estimate of 32 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “The biggest pressure is behind us,” said Rainy Yuan, a
Shanghai-based analyst at  Masterlink Securities Corp. (2856)  “Asset
quality will remain stable.”  Bank of China  rose 2.8 percent to HK$3.65 as of 9:47 a.m.
in  Hong Kong  trading. Agricultural Bank gained 1.1 percent to
HK$3.82.  Loans Manageable  Agricultural Bank President Zhang Yun said yesterday
Chinese banks’ non-performing loans are at a “manageable”
level. Bank of China President Li Lihui said the trend will
stabilize even as bad debts may go up “slightly” this year.  The outstanding amount of bad loans at Chinese lenders
increased for a fifth straight quarter in the last three months
of 2012, the longest deterioration streak since data became
available in 2004, to 492.9 billion yuan ($79 billion) as of
Dec. 31, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said March 1.
The  ratio  of soured debt to total loans was unchanged at 0.95
percent for December compared with three months earlier.  Agricultural Bank and Bank of China joined the larger  China
Construction Bank Corp. (939)  in maintaining double-digit profit
growth as they boosted lending amid government efforts to revive
the world’s second-largest economy.  Li Keqiang , who took over as China’s premier this month,
said 7.5 percent annual growth is needed to meet targets for
2020, which include doubling per capita income. Li extended  Zhou
Xiaochuan ’s record tenure as central bank governor, a signal the
nation’s new leaders may deepen a shift toward a more market-
driven financial system.  More Positive  “Chinese banks’ operating environment this year is
slightly more positive than 2012 as the economy has recovered
and monetary policy has eased,” said Patrick Pun, director of
global investment strategy at Haitong International Securities
Co. “Loosened monetary policy would spur lending and is
beneficial to banks.”  Shares of China’s nine Hong Kong-listed banks gained 14
percent last year on average. Still, they continue to trade near
record-low valuations. Bank of China has climbed 5.5 percent
this year while Agricultural Bank is little changed.  Bank of China Ltd. ’s 139.4 billion  yuan  of profit last year
beat the 132.6 billion-yuan average  estimate  of 31 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. Agricultural Bank’s net income of 145.1
billion yuan was in line with a 148.7 billion-yuan consensus
estimate.  Beat BofA  Bank of America Corp. , whose market value of about $134
billion compares with about $132 billion for Bank of China,
posted net income of $4.19 billion last year, approximately one-
fifth of the Chinese lender’s.  Bank of China’s net interest margin, a measure of
profitability, expanded to 2.15 percent from 2.12 percent in
2011. The gauge at Agricultural Bank narrowed to 2.81 percent
last year from 2.85 percent in 2011, according to yesterday’s
statement.  Founded in 1912 by Sun Yat-sen, known as the father of
modern China, Bank of China held a monopoly on the nation’s
foreign-exchange dealings and overseas banking from 1949 to
1994. The lender today has the biggest overseas operations of
any Chinese bank, accounting for about 24 percent of its assets
at the end of June, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Xiao Gang, who led Bank of China for 10 years, resigned
March 17 and will replace  Guo Shuqing  as head of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
