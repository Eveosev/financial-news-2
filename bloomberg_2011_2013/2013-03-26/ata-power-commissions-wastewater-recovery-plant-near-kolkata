Tata Power Co. (TPWR) , an Indian utility,
commissioned a wastewater recovery plant northwest of Kolkata in
Jamshedpur, the countryâ€™s first planned industrial city.  The Mumbai-based utility, which has 7,700 megawatts of
installed capacity, said the effluent-treatment facility would
process wastewater generated from a filtration plant and reuse
the purified water as an alternative source for cooling-water
systems. The plant can save almost 150,000 cubic meters of water
a year, it said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
