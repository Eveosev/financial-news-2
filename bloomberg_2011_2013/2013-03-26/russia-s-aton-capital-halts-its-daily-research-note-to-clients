Aton Capital, the Moscow-based
brokerage founded by former Kremlin adviser Yevgeny Yuryev, has
stopped sending clients its daily research note.  The company will focus on industry analysis and coming up
with “trading ideas” and the main news, Peter Westin, Aton’s
chief strategist, said by phone. “There is so much research out
there, and we are going to be more focused,” he said.  Brokerages in  Russia , including Renaissance Capital and IFC
Metropol, have been cutting staff, citing shrinking margins.
ING, the biggest Dutch bank, said in October that it will close
its Russian equities unit, while Milan-based  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  said
in June that it would shutter its securities operation there.  BNP Paribas SA,  France ’s largest bank, had been in talks
with Aton to take a stake late last year, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
