STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , which agreed
last week to split up it unprofitable ST-Ericsson chip venture
with Ericsson AB, signed a loan agreement with the  European
Investment Bank  to strengthen its finances.  The 350 million-euro ($450 million) multicurrency facility,
which hasn’t been used, will help fund research and development
in technologies and devices, the Geneva-based semiconductor
manufacturer said in a statement today. STMicro has an option
for disbursement until September next year with final maturity
eight years thereafter.  STMicro also said it has repaid 350 million euros of senior
bonds. The company said it had a net cash position of $1.19
billion at the end of 2012 and existing credit lines for $490
million.  STMicro and Ericsson said March 18 they plan to wind down
their 50-50 chip venture after failing to find a bidder. STMicro
will take on the business’s existing products and 950 employees,
mainly in  France  and in Italy, and incur costs of as much as
$450 million. Ericsson plans to assume 1,800 of the company’s
workers to continue developing its modem technology.  STMicro  shares  closed 1.6 percent higher at 6.20 euros in
Paris yesterday, bringing this year’s gain to 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
