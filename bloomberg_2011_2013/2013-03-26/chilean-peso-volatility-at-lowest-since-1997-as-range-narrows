Volatility in the Chilean peso
dropped to a 15-year low as the threat of central bank
intervention kept the  currency trading  in a shrinking range.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 472.42 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:10 p.m. in Santiago. Thirty-day volatility, a gauge of the
magnitude of the currency’s average daily fluctuations over the
period, dropped to the lowest level since June 1998 while 90-day
volatility fell to the lowest since 1997. The currency has
traded between 469 and 476.5 per dollar since Jan. 4 and between
471.7 and 473.5 for the past week.  Faster-than-forecast  growth,  stable  interest rates  and
foreign investment have pressured the peso to appreciate while
traders have refrained from betting on gains past 470 per dollar
on speculation the central bank may act to stem advances. The
currency reached the strongest level in 20 years against the
country’s major trading partners in the first half of the month,
according to central bank data.  “We have been in the same range for about 60 sessions,”
said Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa
SA in Santiago. “When the peso gains, there are concerns that
the central bank may intervene; when it falls there’s a truck-
load of buying.”  Chilean inflation expectations held close to the lowest
level of the year today. Prices will rise 2.55 percent this
year, according to traders in the forwards market for unidades
de fomento,  Chile ’s inflation-linked accounting unit. The one-
year breakeven inflation rate slid to 2.43 percent, the lowest
since December.  The two-year swap rate in pesos fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.16 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
