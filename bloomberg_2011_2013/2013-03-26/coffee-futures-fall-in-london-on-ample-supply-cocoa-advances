Coffee futures fell in  London  and
were little changed in New York on signs that world supplies
will be sufficient amid rising exports from  Vietnam  and ample
output in  Brazil . Cocoa gained.  Coffee shipments from Vietnam, the biggest producer of the
robusta variety traded in London, may rise 1.6 percent to
190,000 metric tons in March, the country’s General Statistics
Office said. Colombia’s National Association of Coffee Exporters
pegs the country’s crop at about 9 million bags, up from 7.7
million a year earlier. The crop in Brazil, the biggest grower
of arabica traded in New York, may be 55 million bags, a record
for a year when trees enter the low-yielding half of a two-year
cycle, Exportadora de Cafe Guaxupe Ltda. said last week.  “Heavy Brazilian production and a stronger U.S. dollar”
are bearish for arabica prices, Sterling Smith, a futures
specialist at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  Chicago , said in
a report. “The obstacle in robusta’s way is the arabica market,
which is suffering from an ongoing erosion of prices. This will
temper the upside in the less expensive and lower quality
robusta.”  Robusta coffee for May delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$2,106 a ton by 10:39 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London, heading for
a sixth decline in seven sessions. Arabica coffee for the same
delivery month was little changed at $1.3565 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, down 24 percent in the past year.  Cocoa for May delivery rose 0.6 percent to 1,444 pounds
($2,192) a ton in London. Cocoa for the same delivery month
advanced 0.8 percent to $2,148 a ton in New York.  White, or refined, sugar for May delivery was unchanged at
$520.70 a ton in London. Raw sugar for May delivery was 0.1
percent higher at 17.98 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
