The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rebounded to within two points of its record after orders for
U.S. durable goods climbed more than forecast in February and
 home prices  increased the most since June 2006.  Monsanto Co. jumped 4.4 percent as the company and DuPont
Co. agreed to dismiss their respective antitrust and soybean
patent lawsuits. Netflix climbed 5.4 percent after Pacific Crest
Securities LLC raised its price target on the company. Boeing
Co. added 2.1 percent after an appeals court upheld the
dismissal of a lawsuit. Apparel retailers retreated, as Gap Inc.
and Macy’s Inc. lost more than 0.9 percent.  The S&P 500 added 0.8 percent to 1,563.77 at 4 p.m. in  New
York , after the equity benchmark fell 0.3 percent yesterday. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 111.90 points, or 0.8 percent,
to 14,559.65, reaching another record. About 5.2 billion shares
changed hands on U.S. exchanges today, 18 percent below the
three-month average.  “The data continues to be pretty good out of the U.S.,
even though we had some bad news out of  Europe  over the past few
days,” Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of  asset allocation 
for ING Investment Management, which oversees $170 billion, said
by phone. “Housing is a huge part of the economic recovery
story and if housing prices rise, people feel better about their
homes and generally more confident.”  Record Highs  The S&P 500 yesterday came within one point of its record
of 1,565.15 reached in October 2007, before retreating as the
bailout of Cyprus spurred concern bank deposits in other euro-
area nations may be subject to levies to pay for rescues in the
future. The benchmark gauge has surpassed the 1,560 level six
times since March 14, only to fall short of the record each
time. The Dow first surpassing its 2007 all-time high on March
5.  The  bull market  in equities entered its fifth year this
month as the  S&P 500 (SPXL2)  more than doubled from its bottom in 2009,
driven by an unprecedented three rounds of bond purchases by the
 Federal Reserve .  Equities rose today as residential real estate prices
increased in January by the most since June 2006, according to
the  S&P/Case-Shiller index  released today. Orders for U.S.
durable goods climbed more than forecast in February, propelled
by automobiles and a rebound in commercial aircraft, a Commerce
Department report showed.  Consumer Confidence  Consumer confidence  slumped more than forecast this month
as  Washington ’s budget battle soured Americans’ views of the
economic outlook. The consumer confidence index dropped to 59.7
from a revised three-month high of 68 in February, data from the
New York-based Conference Board showed today. New-home sales
declined 4.6 percent, worse than the 3.9 percent median
estimate, another report showed.  “We like to see what consumers do rather than what they
say,” Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector analysis at
Charles Schwab Corp., said in a phone interview. The San
Francisco-based firm has $2.04 trillion in client assets. “They
may say they’re less confident, but does that translate into
their spending? So far we haven’t seen that. Retail sales have
held up pretty well.”  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility  Index (SPX) , which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against
declines, fell 7.1 percent to 12.77. The gauge has tumbled 29
percent for the year.  Health-care companies, energy and utility shares advanced
the most, adding at least 1 percent.  Intel Corp . rose 2.9
percent to $21.77 and Hewlett-Packard Co. jumped 2.3 percent to
$23.64, for the biggest gains in the Dow. American Express Co.
climbed 1.6 percent to a record $67.17, while Pfizer Inc. added
1.6 percent to $28.60, the highest level since 2005.  Monsanto, DuPont  Monsanto rallied 4.4 percent to $103.79. The company will
dismiss its claim that DuPont infringed patents for Roundup
Ready soybeans, setting aside a $1 billion jury award, and
DuPont will dismiss its claim that Monsanto uses monopoly power
to stifle innovation, the companies said in a joint statement.
The world’s largest seed companies also agreed to enter into
licensing agreements for making genetically modified crops.
DuPont fell 0.3 percent to $48.97.  Netflix surged 5.4 percent, the most in the  S&P 500 , to
$190.61. Pacific Crest raised its  price target  on the company to
$225 from its previous estimate of $160, writing in a note that
“Netflix is the future of non-live video.”  Boeing jumped 2.1 percent to $86.62. The Chicago-based
company won a U.S. appeals court ruling affirming the dismissal
of an investor lawsuit accusing company officials of making
misleading public statements about the readiness of its 787
“Dreamliner” aircraft.  Consumer durables and apparel retailers had the smallest
gain as a group among 24 S&P 500 industries. The  International
Council of Shopping Centers  cut its top-end forecast for March
same-store sales. “An abnormally cold bout of weather in
eastern two-thirds of the country brought a chill to consumers
and their interest in spring goods—especially apparel,”  Michael Niemira , ICSC vice president of research and chief economist,
wrote.  Gap lost 2.7 percent to $35.03 and Macy’s slumped 0.9
percent to $41.99. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. slid 1.5 percent to
$45.69.  To contact the reporter on this story:
