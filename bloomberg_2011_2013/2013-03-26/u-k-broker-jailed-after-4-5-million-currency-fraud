A former U.K. foreign-exchange
broker was sentenced to five years in jail for defrauding
investors of about 3 million pounds ($4.5 million).  Ian Dickinson collected more than 11 million pounds from
investors, betting about 750,000 pounds on foreign-exchange
markets and losing about 200,000 pounds, U.K. prosecutors said
on their website today.  Dickinson, who pleaded guilty to one charge of
participating in a fraudulent business as a sole trader in
February, returned 8 million pounds to his investors, the  Crown
Prosecution Service  said. He was sentenced at court in Essex,
 England , today.  “Many of Ian Dickinson’s victims were lifelong friends and
local acquaintances,” Rakesh Somaia, senior fraud specialist at
the CPS, said in the statement. “His fraud was the ultimate
betrayal of their trust.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
