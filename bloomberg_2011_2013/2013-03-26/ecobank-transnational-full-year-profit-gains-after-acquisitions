Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , the
lender that operates in more African countries than any other,
said full-year profit rose 39 percent, boosted by acquisitions
in  Nigeria  and Ghana.  Profit after tax rose to $286.7 million in 2012 from $206.8
million a year earlier, the Lome, Togo-based bank, said in an e-
mailed statement today. Revenue advanced 46 percent to $1.8
billion and total assets increased 16 percent to $20 billion.  Ecobank acquired  Trust Bank Ltd. (TRBK) , a closely held Ghanaian
lender, in January last year and merged it with its local unit
to create the biggest lender by assets in the West African
country. It also bought Oceanic Bank International Plc, a
Nigerian lender that had been bailed out by the central bank, in
February last year.  “The expected synergies resulting from the landmark
acquisitions in Nigeria and Ghana are beginning to come
through,” Laurence do Rego, the lender’s executive director for
finance and risk, said in the statement.  Ecobank’s  shares  traded in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial
capital were little changed at 13.8 naira at the 2:30 p.m.
close, taking the stock’s gain to 22 percent this year, compared
with the 19 percent rise of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
