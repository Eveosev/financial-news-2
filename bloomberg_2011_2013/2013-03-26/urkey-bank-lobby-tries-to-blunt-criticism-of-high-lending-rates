Huseyin Aydin, head of  Turkey ’s
biggest bank lobby group, defended lenders from criticism that
the firms are treating customers unfairly by raising the cost of
loans faster than the  interest rate  they pay on deposits.  Monetary policy  since 2010 has increased banks’ cost of
funding, while the country’s economic slowdown has increased the
risk of loans souring, Aydin, head of the Banks Association of
Turkey, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The group responded after Rifat Hisarciklioglu, head of
Turkey’s Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges, was cited by
the Zaman newspaper as saying that lenders were being “unjust”
to customers by raising deposit rates 1 percentage point and
loan rates by five times that amount.  “The rise in credit risk, linked with the slowdown in
economic activity, has resulted in an increase in risk premiums
applied on industries or customers,” Aydin said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
