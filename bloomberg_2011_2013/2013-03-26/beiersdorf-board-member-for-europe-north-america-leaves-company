Beiersdorf AG, the maker of Nivea
skin cream, said the head of its European and North American
business will quit. The departure comes as the German
manufacturer places more emphasis on  emerging markets .  Peter Feld, who joined the executive board of Hamburg-based
Beiersdorf in August 2010, will leave at his own request on July
31, Beiersdorf said in a statement today. He is leaving “on
amicable terms,” according to the release.  Beiersdorf is trying to reduce dependence on mature markets
by pushing innovation in faster-growing emerging markets. The
owner of the Eucerin and La Prairie brands said in March that
emerging markets now make up almost 50 percent of sales.  Chief Executive Officer Stefan Heidenreich will assume
Feld’s duties “until further notice,” according to the
release.  “We think that the European economic situation will not
substantially improve this year,” Heidenreich said on a
conference call with analysts on March 5. “We also see that the
U.S. is in a critical phase, so again we are focusing on
emerging markets.”  The company regrets “that Mr. Feld has decided not to
extend his contract on its expiry,” Reinhard Poellath, chairman
of Beiersdorf’s supervisory board, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
