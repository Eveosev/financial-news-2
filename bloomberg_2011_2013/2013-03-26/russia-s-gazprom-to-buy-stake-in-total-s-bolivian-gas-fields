Russia’s  Gazprom OAO (GAZP)  will buy a 20
percent stake in  Total SA ’s gas fields in  Bolivia , the Andean
country’s government said.  Bolivia’s Congress late yesterday passed a bill authorizing
the contract change for the Ipati and Aquio fields with the aim
of starting production by the end of 2016, Energy Minister Juan Jose Sosa said today in an e-mailed statement.  Total will retain 60 percent ownership in the fields, while
a unit of  Argentina ’s Techint Group holds 20 percent, Sosa said.  Charles-Etienne Lebatard, a Total spokesman, and Gazprom
spokesman  Sergei Kupriyanov  didn’t immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment outside business hours.  To contact the reporters on this story:
