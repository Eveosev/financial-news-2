Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ,  Europe ’s
biggest discount carrier, agreed to boost the average salary of
its cabin crew and some pilots, replacing pay deals due to
expire next month.  Flight attendants will get an average 10 percent increase
over four years and a guaranteed “home every night” roster,
Dublin-based Ryanair said in a  statement  today.  Under a separate agreement, Ryanair pilots based in
Alicante, Spain, Cork and Shannon in Ireland and working out of
Bristol, Luton and East Midlands airports in the U.K. will get
pay increases of as much as 10 percent over the next five years.
The pilots at these bases, as well those located in Manchester,
England and Valencia, Spain, also negotiated a five-day working
schedule, followed by four days off, the airline said.  “At a time when high-fare airlines around Europe are
cutting jobs and slashing pay and benefits, Ryanair will
continue to offer stability,  job security ” and promotions,
spokesman Robin Kiely said in the statement.  Network carriers including  Air France (AF)  and International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA-controlled Iberia are seeking to
reduce payroll costs to drive a return to profitability in their
short-haul operations. Air France’s main pilot union said March
21 that it would refuse to cooperate with the carrier’s cost-
cutting plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
