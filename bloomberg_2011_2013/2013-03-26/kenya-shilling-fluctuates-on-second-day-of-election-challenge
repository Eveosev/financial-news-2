Kenya ’s shilling swung between
advances and declines against the dollar on the second day of
pre-trial hearings into a court petition challenging the
validity of the presidential election earlier this month.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.2 percent and depreciated as much as 0.1 percent
before trading unchanged for the second session at 85.85 per
dollar by 12:04 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  has refused to concede defeat
in a March 4 presidential election and he is asking the  Supreme
Court  to overturn the result and order a new vote. The court
must deliver a ruling by March 30. The U.S. embassy in Nairobi
said yesterday there may be a “strong public reaction” to the
verdict and urged its  citizens  to avoid large public gatherings,
the central business district and demonstrations.  “We are expecting the announcement of the election
petition by the end of this week and there are some jitters in
the market,” Joel Mbuvi, head of Treasury at Nairobi-based
African Banking Corp., said by phone. “The currency may come
under pressure as we approach the Easter weekend.”  Uganda ’s shilling climbed for a second day, adding 0.2
percent to 2,610 per dollar and heading for the highest close in
more than four months. Tanzania’s currency rose 0.5 percent to
1,617.50 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
