Serbia may replace its import ban
on genetically modified foods with European Union-style
restrictions on the “unpopular products” as it seeks to join
the  World Trade Organization  without angering consumers.  The Balkan country was waited to join the WTO more than
eight years, with its blanket ban on gene-altered products
acting as a key obstacle to entry, Deputy Trade Minister Bojana
Todorovic told a business forum in Belgrade today. Serbia needs
to comply with WTO rules that forbid an outright ban on any
product without having scientific proof it’s unsafe or “risk
isolation from the essential trade organization,” she said.  “Serbia can solve this by adopting regulations like those
in the EU where such products are also very unpopular and need
lengthy certification procedures and strict labeling,”
Todorovic said. “We need to harmonize our laws with the EU
anyway, so if we deal with this the way the EU does, we’ll stay
protected.”  Serbia has completed multilateral talks for WTO membership
and 12 bilateral agreements with members that required them,
while it still needs to conclude trade arrangements with the
U.S., Ukraine,  Brazil ,  India  and the Dominican Republic.  The government hopes to complete them this year, including
with Ukraine, which made an “incredibly huge request” for
having free access to the Serbian market for its steel,
agriculture and other products, Todorovic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
