Japanese government bonds rose,
sending 10-year and 20-year yields to the lowest levels in
almost a decade, after  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
signaled increased purchases of long-term debt.  The 30-year yield touched a 2 1/2-year low with its spread
over 3-year notes narrowing to the least since August 2010.
Kuroda told parliament he will consider all possible measures to
influence the so-called yield curve, including extending bond
maturities in its asset-purchase fund and scrapping a limit on
the central bank’s JGB holdings. Leading bond futures climbed to
a record.  “The chances that the BOJ will purchase bonds with
maturities over 10 years are increasing,” said Atsushi Ito,
chief JGB strategist at BNP Paribas SA. “Bonds on the longer
end are being bought, flattening the yield curve after Governor
Kuroda said he will consider various policy options.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note touched 0.525
percent, the lowest since June 2003 when it reached a record
0.43 percent, before closing at 0.54 percent in Tokyo, according
to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery climbed as much as
0.28 to 145.95, the highest on record. The 20-year rate touched
1.41 percent, the least since July 2003, before finishing at
1.46 percent. Yields on 30-year bonds touched 1.545 percent, a
level unseen since August 2010, and closed at 1.575 percent.  Kuroda said in parliament today he envisages 2 years for
achieving the BOJ’s 2 percent annual inflation target. The
central bank, which next meets on April 3-4, currently buys
government notes with maturities of up to three years through
its 76 trillion-yen ($806 billion) program.  Consumer prices excluding fresh food  probably declined 0.4
percent in February from a year earlier, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
statistics bureau releases data on March 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
