China’s five-year  interest-rate swaps 
rose to a two-week high on speculation an improving U.S. economy
will prompt the  Federal Reserve  to rein in stimulus measures
that have spurred fund flows into  emerging markets .  The People’s Bank of China today gauged demand for an
offering of three-month bills this week, after issuing such
securities on May 9 for the first time since 2011, according to
a trader required to bid at the auctions. Claims for jobless
benefits in the world’s largest economy unexpectedly dropped to
the lowest level in more than five years, an official report
showed on May 9.  “ Yuan  interest-rate swaps are higher along with regional
rates, driven by concerns over the Fed exiting its stimulus
program,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a Hong Kong-based strategist at
Societe Generale SA.  The five-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed five
basis points to 3.53 percent as of 10:30 a.m. in Shanghai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest
level since April 26 and the biggest increase since May 6. The
one-year swap rate increased one basis point to 3.28 percent.  The central bank asked banks to submit orders for seven-and
14-day reverse repurchase contracts and 28-day  repurchase
agreements , according to the trader.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped three basis points to 2.94
percent, according to a weighted average rate compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
