Transnet SOC Ltd. today unveiled
seven tandem-lift cranes that will almost double handling speed
at the port of Durban on  South Africa ’s east coast.  The cranes, which cost 700 million rand ($77 million), were
supplied by  Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co. (900947)  Durban is the
first port in the Southern Hemisphere to use the cranes, which
will increase the speed to 33 gross crane moves per hour from
18, Transnet Chief Executive Officer Brian Molefe told reporters
today.  The equipment is part of the government’s 300 billion rand
infrastructure program and a further 39 ship-to-shore cranes are
planned for the country’s seven other ports.  Durban is South Africa’s busiest port handling almost 63%
of the country’s container traffic, or 3.6 million twenty-foot
containers, or TEUs, a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
