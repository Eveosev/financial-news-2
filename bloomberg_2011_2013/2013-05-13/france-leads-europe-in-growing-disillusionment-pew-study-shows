France ’s frustration with Europe has
soared as French attitudes diverge from German public opinion, a
Pew Research Center report shows.  “No European country is becoming more dispirited and
disillusioned faster than France,” according to the report,
released in Brussels and Washington. “The French are negative
about the economy, with 91 percent saying it is doing badly,
up 10 percentage points from 2012.”  France’s malaise with the European Union’s outlook is more
similar to sentiment in Spain, Italy and Greece than it is to
the mood in  Germany , which is the only EU nation of eight
surveyed where at least half the public backed giving more power
to Brussels to deal with the economic crisis.  “The prolonged economic crisis has created centrifugal
forces that are pulling European public opinion apart,
separating the French from the Germans and the Germans from
everyone else,” according to the report.  At the same time, German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  “remains
the most popular leader in Europe by a wide margin,” with five
of the eight surveyed nations expressing approval.  The EU’s common currency, the 17-nation euro, also retained
support. More than 60 percent of respondents favored keeping the
euro in Greece, Spain, Germany, Italy and France. “Support for
the euro has actually increased in Italy and Spain since last
year,” the study said.  The survey polled 7,646 respondents from March 2-27 in
eight European nations: Italy, France, Spain, the U.K., Greece,
Germany, Poland and the  Czech Republic .  To contact the reporter on this story:
