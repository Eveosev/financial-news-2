The pound strengthened against the
euro after a U.K. business lobby said company sentiment has
improved, increasing speculation the economy will outperform
that of the single-currency region.  Sterling rose versus 11 of its 16 major counterparts as the
 Confederation of British Industry  maintained its forecast for
growth to quicken over the next two years. A U.K. industry
report last week showed the economy  expanded  in the three months
through April, while analysts predict data tomorrow will show
euro-area gross domestic product shrank in the first quarter.
U.K. government bonds were little changed before the Debt
Management Office sells five-year securities tomorrow.  “The trend of economic releases shows more optimism about
the U.K. than about the  euro zone  and that should be reflected
in sterling,” said  Steve Barrow , head of Group-of-10 research
at Standard Bank Plc in  London . “GDP data in the euro zone is
expected to be negative. I’m expecting the pound to move through
the 84 pence area, probably this week.”  The pound gained 0.1 percent to 84.47 pence per euro at
1:44 p.m. London time after appreciating to 83.98 pence on April
26, the strongest level since Jan. 24. Sterling was little
changed at $1.5354.  The CBI’s quarterly forecasts showed the economy will grow
1 percent this year and 2 percent in 2014, the same as it
estimated in February. Britain’s GDP expanded 0.8 percent in the
three months through April, the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research said May 9.  ‘More Confidence’  “In the conversations I have with business leaders, I’ve
been hearing that whilst firms are on a cautious footing,
there’s a bit more confidence about the economic outlook,” CBI
Director-General  John Cridland  said at a press conference in
London. “The right way to judge the economy is that it’s moving
from flat to growth.”  The  euro-area economy  shrank 0.1 percent last quarter,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before the report is
released on May 15.  Futures traders increased bets the pound will weaken
against the dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission show. The difference in the number of
wagers by  hedge funds  and other large speculators on a decline
in the pound compared with those on a gain was 63,086 on May 7,
compared with so-called net shorts of 58,607 a week earlier.  The pound has strengthened 2.2 percent in the past month,
the second-best performer after the Canadian dollar of 10
developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. currency rose 2.1 percent and the
euro gained 0.9 percent.  The 10-year  gilt yield  was little changed at 1.89 percent
after rising 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, during
the previous two trading days. The price of the 1.75 percent
bond due in September 2022 was 98.815.  The Debt Management Office will sell 4.75 billion pounds of
five-year gilts tomorrow and 2.5 billion pounds of 30-year
securities on May 16.  U.K. gilts handed investors a loss of 1.7 percent this
month through May 10, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German bonds fell 1 percent and Treasuries dropped 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
