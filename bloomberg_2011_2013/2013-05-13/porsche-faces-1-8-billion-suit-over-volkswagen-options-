Qatar Holding LLC sold a 10 percent stake in  Porsche Automobil Holding SE (PAH3)  to the Porsche-Piech family, giving the family full control of the  voting rights .  “All of Porsche SE’s common stock is now again held by the Porsche and Piech families,” Wolfgang Porsche, supervisory board chairman, said in a statement today. “This is an expression of our confidence in the prosperous future of Porsche SE as the largest shareholder of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) .”  The holding company’s only asset is 50.7 percent of VW’s common shares. Porsche sold the remainder of the automotive business to VW last year after lawsuits against Porsche scuttled an effort to fully merge the two companies.
