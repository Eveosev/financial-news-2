PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s largest
lender, posted the smallest quarterly net income in three years
as loan revenue slumped on record-low  interest rates  in central
 Europe ’s biggest economy.  First-quarter profit declined to 781.4 million zloty ($244
million) from 1 billion zloty a year earlier, the state-controlled bank said in a regulatory statement today. That beat
the 737.7 million zloty mean  estimate  of 15  analysts  surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net interest income, the difference between what the
bank pays on deposits and what it charges for loans, plunged 18
percent to 1.69 billion zloty.  Polish banks’ combined profit fell 5 percent in the first
quarter as the country battled the steepest slowdown in 12 years
and the central bank cut borrowing costs to help revive growth,
according to data released last week by the Warsaw-based
financial regulator. The  National Bank of Poland  lowered
interest rates by a total of 150 basis points between November
and March and followed that by a further quarter-point reduction
this month.  “While revenues surprised negatively, the bank managed to
cut costs after quarters of nominal growth,” Dariusz Gorski, an
analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK SA in Warsaw, said by phone today.
“It’s positive that they addressed costs in a situation where
it wasn’t possible to increase revenue.”  PKO shares gained 0.1 percent to 33.22 zloty as of 10:03
a.m. in Warsaw, trimming this year’s decline to 10 percent and
valuing the bank at 41.5 billion zloty.  PKO’s profit decline compares with a 6.3 percent drop in
first-quarter net income at its biggest competitor Bank Pekao
SA, majority-owned by UniCredit SpA. Pekao,  Poland ’s second-biggest lender, reported earnings last week.  PKO’s net fees and commissions rose to 770.2 million zloty
in the first quarter from 723.4 million zloty, while bad loan
provisions fell 15 percent to 448 million zloty, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
