Palm oil inventories in  Indonesia ,
the world’s largest producer, probably tumbled in April to the
lowest level in six months as domestic consumption increased for
food and biofuel.  Stockpiles fell 5.1 percent from March to 2.8 million
metric tons, according to the median of estimates from three
plantation executives, an analyst and a refiner compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level since an estimated 2.6
million tons in October and represents a 20 percent plunge from
a record 3.5 million tons in January. Production increased 10.5
percent to 2.1 million tons, while  exports  rose 0.6 percent to
1.71 million tons, the median of six estimates showed.  A third monthly decline in reserves may curb this year’s
5.6 percent loss in futures traded in  Kuala Lumpur . Prices
advanced last week after data showed inventories in  Malaysia ,
the second-biggest supplier, slid to the lowest level in 10
months. Indonesia is set to consume about 33 percent of its
estimated output in 2013, according to the palm oil board.  “Domestic use is increasing for food as well as for
biodiesel,” said Derom Bangun, chairman of the Indonesian Palm
Oil Board. The country will probably consume 9.2 million tons
this year, including 2.4 million tons for biodiesel, he said,
without providing a comparison. Production will reach 28 million
tons from 25.7 million tons in 2012, he said.  Malaysian Reserves  Prices dropped 0.4 percent to 2,301 ringgit ($770) a ton on
the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives by 5:48 p.m. Kuala Lumpur time
after climbing 0.7 percent. Futures had their best performance
in seven weeks in the five days ended May 10 after the Palm Oil
Board in Malaysia said reserves fell 11 percent to 1.93 million
tons in April, the lowest since June.  Palm’s discount to  soybean oil  exceeds $300 per ton,
keeping it attractive compared with other oils, Rabobank
International analysts Luke Chandler and Keith Flury wrote in a
report dated May 10. Palm has averaged $324.36 less than soybean
oil this year, compared with a discount of $201.27 in 2012. Both
are used in food and fuels.  Global palm oil exports are forecast to climb to 43.6
million tons in 2012-2013 from 40.4 million tons a year earlier,
while shipments of palm-kernel oil may rise to 3.44 million tons
from 3.08 million tons, Oil World said in a report e-mailed May
7. The increase will be driven by demand in  India  and China, the
Hamburg-based researcher wrote.  Still, record inventories in  China  and India may limit
 imports  and curb declines in stockpiles in producing nations,
Rabobank said in the report.  Ramadan Demand  Cooking oil reserves in India were 2.1 million tons at the
start of April, near an all-time high of 2.12 million tons in
March, the Solvent Extractors’ Association said. In China, palm
stockpiles expanded to a record 1.35 million tons last week,
China National Grain and Oils Information Center data showed.  From this month, demand may improve as importers book
shipments for the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan starting in
July, said Eddy Martono, a director at Jakarta-based planter PT
Mega Karya Nusa. Usage expands in Ramadan as followers break
daylong fasts with communal meals, boosting purchases from the
 Middle East  to India. Demand will also increase in Indonesia,
the most populous Muslim country, Bangun said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
