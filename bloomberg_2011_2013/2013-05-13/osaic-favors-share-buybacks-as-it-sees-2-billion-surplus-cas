Mosaic Co. (MOS) , the world’s largest
producer of phosphate crop nutrients, said it favors buying back
stock over dividends to redeploy surplus cash, which is forecast
to total about $2 billion at the end of this month.  The company’s dividend, currently 25 cents a quarter, will
“grow in line with earnings growth,” Mosaic also said today in
a regulatory filing of slides for an investor presentation.  Mosaic’s comments follow criticism from some shareholders
that the company hasn’t distributed enough of its cash to them,
 Malcolm Polley , chief investment officer at Stewart Capital
Advisors LLC in  Indiana , Pennsylvania, said May 7 in a telephone
interview.  Plymouth, Minnesota-based Mosaic, North America’s second-largest potash producer by market value, had about $3.3 billion
of cash as of the end of its fiscal third quarter in February,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors are saying ‘show me the money,’” said Polley,
who manages $1.1 billion including shares of Mosaic. “The fear
is always that management does something stupid with the cash. I
don’t think we have that issue with Mosaic, but there is always
that fear.”  Mosaic fell 0.9 percent to $63.28 on May 10 in New York.
The shares rose 12 percent this year.  (Mosaic scheduled a conference call at 9 a.m. New York
