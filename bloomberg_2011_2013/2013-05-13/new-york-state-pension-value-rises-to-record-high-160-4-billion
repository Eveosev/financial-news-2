The value of the  New York  state
pension fund rose to a record $160.4 billion in year ending
March 31, recovering after the financial crisis wiped out almost
one-third of its assets, Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said.  The New York State Common Retirement Fund, which provides
benefits to almost 1 million state and local workers and their
beneficiaries, had an estimated 10.4 percent rate of return in
fiscal 2013, DiNapoli said in a statement. That’s about the same
gain posted by the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index over the
same period. The fund was valued at $154.5 billion in 2007,
before the start of the longest recession since the Great
Depression.  “The New York State Common Retirement Fund has reached a
milestone,” DiNapoli said in a statement. “It remains well
positioned for growth as the financial markets continue to gain
strength.”  New York has one of the nation’s best-funded retirement
plans, with about 94 percent of assets needed to pay projected
obligations in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
isn’t alone in seeing gains. The 100 largest public pensions in
the U.S. had $2.9 trillion in assets in the fourth quarter of
2007, according to  U.S. Census Bureau  data. That dropped to $2
trillion in 2009 and rebounded to almost $2.8 trillion as of
Sept. 30.  Domestic equities, which compose about 36 percent of the
New York fund’s total investments, returned 14.5 percent, the
most of any of the fund’s asset classes, DiNapoli said.  The  California Public Employees’ Retirement System , the
largest U.S. pension, reached a market value of $260.8 billion
after returning 13 percent in 2012, it said last month. It had
$260.6 billion on Oct. 31, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
