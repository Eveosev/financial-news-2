There's a new must-read for every taste—and trip. Kevin Kwan's  Crazy Rich Asians  peeks into the lives of (fictional) Chinese billionaires (Doubleday, $26), while  Strange Stones , by  The New Yorker 's former China correspondent Peter Hessler, includes tales such as a taste-test of two rat restaurants in southern China (Harper Perennial, $15). Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's novel  Americanah  follows two Nigerians living in America and London—and finding love at home (Knopf, $27). And for a trip to southern Africa, read  Condé Nast Traveler  contributor Paul Theroux's  Last Train to Zona Verde: My Ultimate African Safari  (Houghton Mifflin, $27).
