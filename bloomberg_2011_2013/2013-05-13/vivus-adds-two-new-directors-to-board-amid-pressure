Vivus Inc. (VVUS)  appointed two additional
directors, increasing the size of its board by 50 percent in
less than a month amid pressure from shareholders over the
company’s strategy for promoting its obesity drug Qsymia.  J. Martin Carroll and Jorge Plutzky joined the board, the
 Mountain View , California-based drugmaker said in a statement
today. On April 30, the company said it appointed Robert N. Wilson. The additions bring the size of Vivus’s board to nine.  First Manhattan Co., the largest holder of Vivus stock with
more than 9 percent, has criticized the company’s handling of
Qsymia and proposed a slate of six directors. Last year QVT
Financial LP, the third-largest holder of Vivus stock, advocated
a sale of the company.  “We strongly believe that a near-complete turnover of the
board at this time would significantly jeopardize the progress
we are making toward our strategic objectives and is not in the
best interest of stockholders,” Vivus Chief Executive Officer
Leland Wilson wrote in a letter to shareholders today. “We
intend to vigorously oppose First  Manhattan ’s hostile
solicitation.”  Vivus rose less 4.2 percent to $13.50 at the close in  New
York . The shares have declined 53 percent since Qsymia was
approved in July by U.S. regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
