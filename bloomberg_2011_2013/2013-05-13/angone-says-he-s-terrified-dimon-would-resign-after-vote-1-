Ken Langone, the billionaire founder
of Home Depot Inc., said he’s “terrified”  Jamie Dimon  might
resign from  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  if shareholders vote to
separate the roles of chairman and chief executive officer.  “The exit will blow your mind,” Langone said today in an
interview with Betty Liu on Bloomberg Television. “I am
terrified” investors will sell shares, he said. Langone said he
has “tens of millions of dollars” invested in New York-based
JPMorgan.  Investors would risk shortening Dimon’s tenure if they
appoint a separate chairman and their company’s stock may lose
its “premium valuation,” Charles Peabody, an analyst at
Portales Partners LLC, said last month in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
