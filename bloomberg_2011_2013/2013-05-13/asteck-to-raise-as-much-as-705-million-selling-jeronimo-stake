Asteck SA is selling half its stake
in Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA,  Portugal ’s largest retailer,
according to a statement from the shareholder.  The 31.5 million shares are being offered to investors at
between 16.5 euros and 17.25 euros, said a person with knowledge
of the deal. At the top end of the range, that values the sale
at as much as 543.4 million euros ($705.2 million). There is
enough demand from investors for all the shares being offered,
the person said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is managing the deal, Asteck said
in a statement. The proceeds will be used to fund investments in
the core business of the Heerema Group, of which Asteck is a
wholly owned unit. Asteck will retain a 5 percent stake in
Jeronimo after the sale, according to the statement.  Shares of Lisbon-based Jeronimo fell 0.6 percent to 17.87
euros. They have gained about 22 percent this year, compared
with a 10 percent increase in Portugal’s benchmark PSI-20 Index.  Additional share sales, including accelerated book builds,
raised about $39 billion this year, compared with $23 billion in
the same period in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
