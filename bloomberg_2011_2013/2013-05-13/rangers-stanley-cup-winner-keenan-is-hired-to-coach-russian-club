Mike Keenan, who led the  New York
Rangers  to the 1994 Stanley Cup title, was hired as coach of
Russia’s Metallurg Magnitogorsk hockey club.  Keenan, 63, signed a two-year contract and will replace
former Carolina Hurricanes coach Paul Maurice, the Kontinental
Hockey League team said on its  website . Financial terms weren’t

2007 to 2009. He was fired with a year left on his contract
after the team’s first-round playoff loss.  Over a 20-year NHL coaching career with seven teams, Keenan
led the Rangers (1994), the  Philadelphia Flyers  (1985 and 1987)
and the  Chicago Blackhawks  (1992) to the Stanley Cup Final. He
was named the NHL’s top coach in 1985.  Keenan ranks fifth in NHL wins with 672,  games coached
