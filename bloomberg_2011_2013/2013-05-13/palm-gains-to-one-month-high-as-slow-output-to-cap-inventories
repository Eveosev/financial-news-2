Palm oil  advanced to the highest
level in more than a month on speculation that stockpiles in
Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer, will remain below
2 million tons for a second month as output growth slows.  The contract for July delivery climbed as much as 1 percent
to 2,341 ringgit ($780) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the highest price for the most-active futures since
April 12, before trading at 2,323 ringgit by 12:02 p.m. in  Kuala
Lumpur . Futures gained 3 percent last week.  Reserves fell 11 percent to 1.93 million tons in April, the
lowest level since June, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board. That was less than the median estimate of 2.06 million
tons in a Bloomberg survey. Output climbed 3.1 percent to 1.37
million, while exports dropped 5.6 percent to 1.45 million tons,
the board said May 10.  “We expect the slower output growth to sustain in the
current month and this will help keep stocks at around 1.92
million tons at the end of May,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. Demand from importers should pick up
before the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, starting in July
this year, she wrote in a report dated May 11.  Consumption usually increases during Ramadan, boosting
purchases from the  Middle East  to  South Asia  including  India ,
the world’s biggest buyer.  Exports from Malaysia plunged 17 percent to 380,047 tons in
the first 10 days of this month, surveyor Intertek said May 10.
Shipments dropped 18 percent to 377,193 tons from the same
period in April, according to Societe Generale de Surveillance.  Stockpiles at major ports in China, the second-biggest
importer, climbed last week to a record 1.35 million tons, up
about 50,000 tons from a week earlier, the China National Grain
and Oils Information Center said in a report e-mailed today.  Refined palm oil for September delivery was little changed
at 6,128 yuan ($997) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while  soybean oil  fell 0.4 percent to 7,498  yuan . On the Chicago
Board of Trade, soybeans for July gained 0.2 percent to $14.015
a bushel. Soybean oil rose 0.2 percent to 49.32 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
