The platinum market swung into the
biggest shortage since 2002 last year as supply fell to a 12-year low on strikes and stoppages in top producer South Africa,
according to  Johnson Matthey Plc. (JMAT)  The palladium deficit was the
biggest since 2000.  The platinum shortage was 375,000 ounces last year and a
“slight deficit” is possible this year if investment continues
to grow, London-based Johnson Matthey said today in a report.
Platinum supply fell 13 percent to 5.64 million ounces, as total
demand declined 0.6 percent, it said. Lower palladium sales from
Russian state stockpiles and constrained output in  Russia  and
South Africa is “a recipe for an under-supplied market” and
higher prices, Johnson Matthey said.  “The supply that we see at the moment is being balanced by
autocatalyst, jewelry and industrial demand,” Mark Bedford,
managing director for precious metals at Johnson Matthey, said
in an interview before the report. “Investment really becomes a
balancing figure. If investment demand continues to be positive
in 2013, I wouldn’t be surprised if we didn’t see a similar sort
of deficit as the one that we saw this year.”  Both metals are mostly used in vehicle pollution-control
devices and jewelry, with palladium favored mainly for gasoline-burning engines in the U.S. and Asia and platinum for diesels in
Europe. Platinum holdings in exchange-traded funds expanded 11
percent this year after growing 16 percent in 2012, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Palladium ETF holdings are up 13
percent in 2013 after increasing 11 percent last year, the data
show.  Strikes, Closings  Platinum shipments from top producer South Africa dropped
16 percent to 4.1 million ounces as at least 750,000 ounces of
supply was lost to strikes and mine closings, according to
Johnson Matthey. Recycling slid 1.5 percent to 2.03 million
ounces as lower prices encouraged stocks retention.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the biggest producer of the
metal, said May 10 it plans to cut platinum output by 250,000
ounces this year as part of the plan to return to profitability
amid surging costs and slower demand.  Autocatalyst usage gained 1.7 percent to 3.24 million
ounces on demand in Asia and North America and increased usage
in the non-road diesel engines, the researcher and trader said.
Jewelry consumption rose 12 percent to 2.78 million ounces and
investment demand slid 1.1 percent.  Autocatalyst demand is “unlikely” to grow this year and
jewelry demand will decline “slightly,” according to the
report.  Automaker Demand  Platinum for immediate delivery, down 3.5 percent this year
to $1,485.60 an ounce, will average $1,570 in the next six
months, it said. Palladium, little changed at $703.64 an ounce,
will average $740 in the next six months, Johnson Matthey said.  Palladium swung into deficit last year from a surplus of
1.19 million ounces in 2011 on record demand for autocatalysts
and investor demand amid lower supplies, Johnson Matthey said.
Gross demand for palladium rose 16 percent as supply fell by 11
percent to 6.55 million ounces, the lowest since 2002.  Demand from automakers climbed 7.5 percent to a record 6.62
million ounces on recovery in  Japan  and growth in  China .
Industrial demand slipped 4 percent to 2.37 million ounces and
jewelry demand slid 12 percent to 445,000 ounces, according to
the report.  Palladium sales from Russian government inventories, a
state secret, will come to about 100,000 ounces in 2013 from
250,000 ounces in 2012, Bedford said. This year will be the last
year of “substantial shipments” from Russian stockpiles, he
added. Supply from South Africa declined 9 percent to 2.33
million ounces last year.  Rhodium Surplus  Rhodium’s surplus narrowed to 15,000 ounces last year from
134,000 ounces in 2011 year on higher demand for autocatalysts
in North America and Japan, Johnson Matthey said. The commodity
is mainly used in autocatalysts and also in the chemical and
glass industries. It’s up 6.5 percent this year at $1,150 an
ounce, according to Johnson Matthey  prices  on Bloomberg.  Ruthenium consumption slipped 32 percent to 679,000 ounces
in 2012 on lower demand from the electronics industry. It’s
mostly used for coating computer hard disks. Demand for iridium,
used in spark plugs and for growing metal oxide crystals,
dropped 46 percent 178,000 ounces, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
