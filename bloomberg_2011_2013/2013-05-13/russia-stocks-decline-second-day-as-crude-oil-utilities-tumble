Russian  equities  fell the most in two
weeks as crude oil, the nation’s chief export earner, retreated
and OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , the biggest coking coal producer, sank as output
decreased.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  dropped 0.7 percent to 1,416.50 by the
close in Moscow, having gained 1.3 percent last week. Consumer
goods and basic materials stocks slid the most among nine
industry groups. Mechel retreated 4.7 percent to 126.60 rubles,
the most since April 17.  Crude oil fell for a third day, the longest run of declines
in four weeks, losing 1.4 percent to $94.72 a barrel in New York
as OPEC boosted output to the highest level in five months.
Mechel tumbled the most on the index as total coal production
fell 8 percent in the first quarter from the previous period,
according to a statement today.  “Investors are disappointed in the Russian market,”
Alexei Yazikov, head of research at Aton Capital LLC, said by
phone from Moscow. “The market has a high dependency on oil
prices. There’s little hope that oil can rise further from
current levels. ”  OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s biggest natural gas export monopoly,
closed down 2.3 percent at 129.61 rubles, the most since April
11.  VTB Group decreased 3.4 percent to 4.80 kopeks, paring
gains since announcing investors agreed to buy all $3.3 billion
of the shares it’s selling to increase capital. The stock rose
9.4 percent from the sale announcement on April 29 through May
10.  MSCI Rebalancing  The pre-emptive rights offering for VTB’s local shares
closes on May 17 and tomorrow for its depositary receipts, Luis Saenz, head of equity sales and trading at BCS Financial Group,
said in an e-mailed note today. VTB’s depositary receipts
declined 2.5 percent to $3.002.  “With VTB, we’re seeing a mid-term correction,” Natalia Berezina, an analyst at UralSib Capital, said by phone from
Moscow. “A lot of people were buying the stock on the SPO news,
now they’re taking a break.”  MSCI Inc. is due to announce the results of its semi-annual
index rebalancing for its  Russia index  on May 15. VTB’s
weighting may be raised because of the share sale, triggering
capital inflows into the stock, according to Berezina.  OAO Lukoil increased 0.8 percent to 2,050.30 rubles in
Moscow after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. named the company its top
pick in the region’s energy sector. Lukoil added 1.6 percent to
$64.15 in  London .  Cheapest Valuations  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.3
times 12-month estimated earnings and has lost 4 percent this
year, compared with a 10.5 multiple for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index, which has dropped 1 percent in the period.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  retreated 0.5 percent to
1,422.29. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in stock futures, added 0.3 percent to 20.61. The  Market
Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, slid 1.1 percent to $27.31 in New York today.  The number of shares traded on the Micex was 13 percent
below its 30-day average, while the gauge’s 10-day price swings
rose to 18.075.  To contact the reporter on this story:
