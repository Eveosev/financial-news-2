South Korea ’s won fell to a two-week
low on concern the yen’s slide will hurt the nation’s exports
after the Group of Seven finance chiefs indicated they will
tolerate a weak Japanese currency.  Government bonds  dropped.  G-7 policy makers on May 11 signaled acceptance of the
yen’s decline through 100 per dollar for the first time since
2009, saying they examined  Japan ’s strategy and will monitor its
impact on currencies. The won declined for a third day, its
longest run of losses since April 8, as global funds  sold  more
local shares than they bought today, exchange data show.  “Concerns about the impact of a weakening yen on South
Korea deepened,” said Son Eun Jeong, an analyst at Woori
Futures Co. in Seoul. “Foreign investors started to sell Korean
shares again after a one-day buy on the Bank of Korea’s
interest-rate cut last week.”  The won fell 0.5 percent to 1,111.78 per dollar in Seoul,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
1,116.68, its weakest level since April 25. One-month implied
volatility in the won, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, rose 79 basis points, or
0.79 percentage point, to 8.61 percent.  The yen declined as low as 102.15 per dollar, the lowest
level since October 2008. The currency has fallen 15 percent
against the dollar this year and 13 percent versus the won as
the  Bank of Japan  stepped up monetary stimulus. That makes it
harder for exporters such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai
Motor Co. to compete against Japanese rivals overseas.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent government bonds
due March 2018 rose three basis points to 2.66 percent,
according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
