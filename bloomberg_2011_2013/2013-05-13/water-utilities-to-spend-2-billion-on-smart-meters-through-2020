U.S. water utilities will spend $2
billion on smart meters in infrastructure upgrades this year
through 2020, almost matching all previous investment in the
leak-finding devices, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Water utilities until this year had spent $2.4 billion on
smart meters, according to data compiled by the London-based
research firm. Investment peaked at $395 million in 2010 as
companies took advantage of stimulus funding allocated for
clean-energy and water projects, said Maxime Serrano Bardisa of
BNEF.  Investment in the emerging market will decline through 2015
before rebounding on increasing water prices and as “the first
meters rolled out 15 years ago will need to be replaced,” the
BNEF water analyst said in an interview.  About $1.7 billion of the  $7.2 billion  given to the
Environmental Protection Agency as part of the 2009 American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act was set aside for infrastructure
that included upgrading and rolling out new smart meters for
water.  To contact the reporter on this story:
