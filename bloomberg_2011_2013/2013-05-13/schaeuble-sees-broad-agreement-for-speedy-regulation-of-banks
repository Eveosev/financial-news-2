German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble comments on the Slovenian government’s position on
possibly seeking aid from  Europe ’s bailout fund, the European
Stability Mechanism, the region’s future banking union and
controversy over the need to reduce budget deficits.  He spoke to reporters before a meeting of euro-region
finance ministers in Brussels today:  On Slovenia:  “The Slovenian government says it can do it without the
rescue umbrella, it doesn’t want a program. I think it is
right.”  On banking union:  “The decisive point is that we regulate precisely the
sequence of liability, from shareholders to the various kinds of
creditors and investors on to the  member states  and in the end
also the European fund.”  “There is general agreement on that but we have to assure
that we do this in parallel to the recapitalization rules for
the ESM and for the restructuring directive we do within the
EU-27.”  “There is broad agreement that we need this regulation
fast. We will greatly accelerate the deliberations about the
restructuring and resolution directive and bring into force much
earlier than envisaged by the European Commission so far.”  “The preparations for the real banking union can be
completed by the middle of the year as envisaged by the heads of
state and government.”  The existing treaties “don’t provide a sufficient basis
for a European restructuring authority, but that can be done
with a network of national authorities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
