Cattle rose for the second time in
three sessions on speculation that demand for beef will rise
before the U.S. Memorial Day holiday on May 27 and Father’s Day
on June 16, traditionally popular times to grill steaks.  Wholesale  beef  surged to a record $2.0549 a pound on May 9,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . About 631,000
cattle were slaughtered last week, up 1.1 percent from the prior
week. Money managers increased their net-long  positions , or bets
prices will rise, by 41 percent in the week through May 7, the
most in a month, government data show.  “It is still thought that there is a certain amount of
beef business that needs to be done for Memorial Day and
Father’s Day,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle
Brokerage LLC in Thorp,  Wisconsin , said in an e-mailed report.  Cattle futures for June delivery climbed 0.4 percent to
$1.209 a pound at 10:13 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Through May 10, the most-active contract was down 9 percent this
year, partly on speculation that demand for beef will decline
amid rising prices.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.1
percent to $1.46825 a pound.  Hog futures for June settlement gained 0.4 percent to
90.875 cents a pound in  Chicago  trading. The price through May
10 gained 5.6 percent this year, partly on speculation that
consumers would turn to pork because of the rising cost of beef.  To contact the reporter on this story:
