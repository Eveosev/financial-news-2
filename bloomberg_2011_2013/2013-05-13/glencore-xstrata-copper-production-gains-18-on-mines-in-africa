Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) , the biggest
exporter of coal for power stations, said first-quarter copper
production rose 18 percent after gains at its mines in  Africa .  Output was 321,800 metric tons, Baar, Switzerland-based
Glencore said today in a statement, compared with 273,200 tons a
year earlier. African production jumped 44 percent, it said. The
figures include operations acquired from Xstrata Plc.  Glencore completed a 15-month long takeover of Xstrata this
month to create the fourth-largest mining company with a market
value of $70 billion. The combined group has interests in about
35 coal mines in Colombia, Africa and  Australia , accounting for
about 10 percent of global seaborne supplies of the fuel.  Coal output grew 1 percent to 32.7 million tons, it said.
Prices for the fuel exported from Australia, its largest coal
producing region, were 23 percent lower, it said.  “Despite a poor quarter for thermal coal, the company
produced a relatively solid quarter for copper, zinc and other
operations,” BMO Capital Markets analyst  Tony Robson  said in a
note. Coal output was 9 percent less than BMO forecast, he said.  Glencore Xstrata has halted work on the Balaclava Island
export terminal in Australia’s Queensland state because of poor
market conditions and overcapacity, it said earlier in an e-mailed statement. The facility had planned export capacity of 35
million tons a year, according to the company’s website.  The  stock  advanced 0.4 percent to close at 345.3 pence in
London trading. The shares are down 1.7 percent this year.  Zinc, Nickel  Zinc output was little changed at 386,900 tons, lead rose
10 percent to 80,000 tons and Nickel 4 percent to 25,500 tons.  Spending on new projects is estimated at $29 billion in the
next three years, Glencore said this month. After 2015, spending
is set to “materially decline” to $4 billion to $5 billion.
Expanding the Katanga and Mutanda copper mines in the  Democratic
Republic  of Congo is on schedule for completion this year.  The group employs about 190,000 people in more than 50
countries across its industrial and trading divisions. The
takeover of Xstrata was completed almost two years after
Glencore’s $10 billion initial public offering that ended more
than three decades of it operating as a closely held company.  The Xstrata acquisition will reduce the trading arm’s
contribution to earnings to 28 percent from 63 percent, Deutsche
Bank AG analysts Rob Clifford and Grant Sporre wrote in a May 2
report. The copper and coal divisions will be the biggest
contributors to profit this year, according to Deutsche Bank.  The performance by the marketing division in the quarter
was “broadly in line with our expectations,” Glencore said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
