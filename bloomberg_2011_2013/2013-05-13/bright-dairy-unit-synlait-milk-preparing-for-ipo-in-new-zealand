Bright Dairy & Food Co. (600597) , a Shanghai-based dairy company, said its  New Zealand  unit Synlait Milk Ltd.
is in the process of planning an initial public offering in New
Zealand.  Bright Dairy said in July 2010 it would pay NZ$82 million
($68 million) for a 51 percent stake in Christchurch-based milk
processor Synlait. Bright Dairy didn’t specify in yesterday’s
statement to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  the amount Synlait was
looking to raise in the IPO.  Chinese dairy companies including  China Mengniu Dairy Co. (2319) 
have been seeking acquisitions to improve the quality of their
supply chain amid safety concerns. Food-safety scandals in China
ranging from toxic melamine in milk powder to kitchen waste
reprocessed into cooking oil and rat meat being sold as mutton
has driven consumers to buy products overseas.  Bright Dairy fell as much as 3.4 percent to 14.35  yuan  in
Shanghai trading today, headed for the lowest level since May 2.
The stock has gained 47 percent this year, against a 1.9 percent
decline in the benchmark Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite
Index.  Synlait, which started operations in 2000 and processes
more than 500 million liters of milk each year, posted a $6.3
million profit after tax for the year ending 31 July 2012, the
company said on its  website .  The New Zealand milk processor had the intention of listing
within three to five years of the completion of the deal,
according to yesterday’s stock exchange statement, citing a
company announcement from July 2010.  Mengniu, the country’s largest dairy producer, said on May
8 that it had agreed to buy 26.9 percent of milk supplier  China
Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd. (1117)  for HK$3.18 billion ($410 million) to
gain greater control of milk supplies amid food safety concerns
in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
