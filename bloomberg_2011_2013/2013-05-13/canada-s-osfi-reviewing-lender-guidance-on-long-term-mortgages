Canada’s banking regulator is
reviewing its guidance to lenders on mortgages of more than 25
years, a spokesman for the agency said.  Brock Kruger, a spokesman for the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions, said the regulator is
consulting with banks on the issue given housing prices and
rising debt levels. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported the
review earlier today.  “It is common practice for OSFI to review our guidance
with industry to determine its effectiveness and to assess
impacts,” Kruger said in an e-mailed statement. “We are
working to determine the desirability of some changes.”  “Any proposed changes to our mortgage guideline that may
result from this work would be subject to a public consultation
process,” Kruger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
