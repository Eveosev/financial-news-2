Brazil  may triple the size of a
funding program for research into new sugar-cane processing
technologies to as much as 3.4 billion reais ($1.7 billion).  BNDES, Brazil’s national development bank, and the
research-financing agency Finep have approved 2.2 billion reais
of projects and may approve another 400 million reais this year,
Artur Yabe, manager of the Rio de Janeiro-based lender’s
biofuels department, said May 10 in a telephone interview. The
organizations mays start evaluating another 800 million reais of
projects by the end of the year.  The program was  announced  in 2011 with a budget of 1
billion reais.  “These types of technologies are already being developed
in  Europe  and the U.S. but they’re tailored for the biomass
there,” he said. “Brazilian biomass is different and requires
its own technology.”  Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social and
Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, as the two agencies are
formally known, will disburse funds for the approved projects by
the end of next year, he said. The recipients will include
GranBio Investimentos SA, a local company planning the world’s
second plant that produces ethanol from crop waste, as well as
 Bunge Ltd. (BG)  and  Solazyme Inc. (SZYM) , which are building a plant that
uses algae to turn sugar cane into a raw material for other
chemicals.  The funds will be used for loans and grants, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
