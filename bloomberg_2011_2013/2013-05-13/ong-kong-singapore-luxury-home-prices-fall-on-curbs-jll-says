Hong Kong  and Singapore are the two
major Asian cities that recorded declines in luxury home prices
in the first quarter on government measures to prevent housing
bubbles, according to  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)   Prices in Hong Kong, the world’s most-expensive place to
buy an apartment, fell 1.1 percent in the first quarter from the
previous three months, while they declined 0.6 percent in
Singapore, the Chicago-based realtor said in an e-mailed
statement.  Asian governments from Singapore to China are imposing
measures such as purchase restrictions and additional
transaction taxes in an effort to counter monetary easings by
central banks in the U.S. and  Europe  that have kept borrowing
costs low and the increased buying power of an expanding middle
class in the region.  “Policy restrictions in some markets will continue to
limit price growth for the rest of the year,” Jane Murray, head
of Asia-Pacific research at Jones Lang LaSalle, said in the
statement.  Luxury  home prices  in Jakarta rose 8.7 percent during the
quarter, the most among the nine cities surveyed by Jones Lang
LaSalle.  Kuala Lumpur  was second with a gain of 6 percent, while
Beijing and Shanghai advanced 2.4 percent and 1.8 percent
respectively, the survey showed.  Prices in Hong Kong will fall as much as 10 percent over
the rest of 2013, while Singapore will drop about 5 percent, the
broker said. Jakarta will continue to lead growth in the region,
it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
