Gasoline slid to a one-week low as
 Phillips 66 (PSX)  restarted units after a  power failure  at its Sweeny
refinery in Texas, easing concern that U.S. Gulf Coast supplies
will be reduced.  Futures slipped further below the 200-day moving average at
$2.8886 a gallon, a key technical resistance level. Phillips 66
said yesterday that power was restored to the 247,000-barrel-a-day plant and units were being restarted. Crack spreads
narrowed.  “The issues at Sweeny are going to be short-lived,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“There is plenty of supply as more and more refineries are
returning from maintenance here and in Europe.”  Gasoline for June delivery fell 3.93 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to settle at $2.821 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Trading volume was 15 percent below the 100-day
average at 3:17 p.m.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 78 cents to
$23.31 a barrel, and the fuel’s  premium  over Brent fell 56 cents
to $15.66.  Gasoline may drop below $2.70 a gallon after failing to
break above the 200-day moving average last week, according to a
technical analysis on May 10 by  Michael Smith , president of T&K
in Port Saint Lucie,  Florida . Futures may slip to $2.6879 a
gallon, the intraday low on May 1 and the lowest level of 2013,
Smith said.  “I can’t see any reason for a speculator to buy it right
now,” Smith said today.  Reducing Positions  The May 10 Commitments of Traders report showed  hedge funds 
reducing their bullish positions on gasoline. Large speculators
cut bullish  gasoline  wagers 9.6 percent to 33,343 contracts of
futures and options in the week through May 7, the lowest level
since Oct. 1, 2010, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show.  Gasoline demand , measured by deliveries to wholesalers, in
the week ended May 3 was the lowest seasonally since 1999,
according to Energy Information Administration data. East Coast
gasoline stocks in that same period were at the highest level
for this time of year since 1999.  ‘There are demand concerns everywhere,’’ said Amrita Sen,
chief oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research
company in  London .  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for June delivery fell 1.52 cents

widened 23 cents to $26.25 a barrel. The  premium over Brent  rose
45 cents to $18.60.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.3 cent to
$3.579 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. That’s the
highest level since April 8. Prices are 14.9 cents below a year
