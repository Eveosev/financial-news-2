Lawyers representing the ex-wife of
SAC Capital Advisors LP founder  Steven A. Cohen  in her
racketeering lawsuit against her ex-husband asked a court to let
them withdraw from the case.  The lawyers, Howard Foster and Matthew Galin, said in court
papers filed today in  Manhattan  federal court that the move is
“a mutual decision” reached with  Patricia Cohen . Cohen hired
the lawyers in 2010 to represent her in the suit, filed a year
earlier, in which she alleged her ex-husband cheated her out of
money in their 1990 divorce, Foster and Galin said.  Patricia Cohen intends to retain new counsel within 30
days, the lawyers said.  A federal appeals court reinstated Patricia Cohen’s case
last month after a lower court dismissed it in March 2011. U.S.
District Judge  Richard Holwell  ruled that Patricia Cohen had
taken too long to file the case. Holwell said she made similar
claims in a 1991 lawsuit in which she accused  Steven Cohen  of
hiding assets and lying about the value of his investments.  In last month’s ruling, the New York-based appeals court
reinstated claims against Steven Cohen based on federal
racketeering law, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. The court
said Holwell was correct to dismiss a claim of unjust
enrichment.  The case is Cohen v. Cohen, 09-cv-10230, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
