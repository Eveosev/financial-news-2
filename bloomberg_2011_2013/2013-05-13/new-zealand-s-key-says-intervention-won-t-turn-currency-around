New Zealand Prime Minister John Key
said intervention won’t change the direction of the currency,
less than a week after the central bank said it had sold the
nation’s dollar to take the tops off rallies.  “If you are asking me whether I believe intervention turns
around the direction of the currency, it definitely does not,”
Key told reporters in Wellington today.  Governor Graeme Wheeler last week said the central bank had
intervened in the currency, without disclosing details on the
timing or the amount. He earlier described the  New Zealand
dollar  as “significantly over-valued” and “problematic” for
companies operating in international markets.  The currency fell 2.7 percent last week, its biggest weekly
decline this year. It bought 83.10 U.S. cents at 5:15 p.m. in
Wellington.  The central bank has kept the official  cash rate  at a
record-low 2.5 percent since March 2011. It acts independently
of the government and has the legal right to intervene, said
Key.  “They’ve done that before and if they deem that to be the
point at which under their rules it makes sense, then yes,” Key
said, when asked whether he supported the action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
