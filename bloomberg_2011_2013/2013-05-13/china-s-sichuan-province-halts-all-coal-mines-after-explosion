China  has ordered production
suspended at all coal mines in the southwestern province of
Sichuan after a blast on May 11 killed 28 workers.  “All coal mines across the province should be suspended
immediately to have a comprehensive overhaul and thorough
checks,” the State Administration of Work Safety said in a
 statement  dated yesterday on its website. The province aims to
close 500 small coal mines by the end of the year.  The explosion in the Taozigou coal mine near Lu County in
Sichuan’s Luzhou city left 28 miners dead and 18 others injured,
including three in critical condition, the official Xinhua
Agency reported  today .  China has been working to improve safety in an industry in
which accidents killed 1,973 people in 2011 and 2,433 in 2010,
according to the state administration. The U.S., the world’s
second-biggest coal producer, had 48 deaths in 2010.  Sichuan is China’s 16th-biggest coal producing province,
accounting for 0.6 percent of the 173 million metric tons
produced by the nation’s coal mines, according to data from
independent researcher Glinfo.com. Power-station coal at China’s
Qinhuangdao Port fell to the lowest price on April 21 in more
than three years as consumption slowed.  “The mine suspension isn’t likely to have any impact on
coal prices nationwide,” said Jiang Weibo, a Shanghai-based
analyst with Glinfo. “It would help stall local prices from
further declines as Sichuan mines supply mainly to local users.
The Sichuan market is pretty isolated.”  Initial Investigations  Coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories a kilogram
at Qinhuangdao slid to a range of 605  yuan  ($98.40) to 615 yuan
a ton on April 11, the least since Oct. 12, 2009, according to
data from the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association.
Prices were unchanged on May 5.  A total of 108 miners were working underground at the
Taozigou mine around the time of the blast at about 2 p.m. on
May 11, the Sichuan Provincial Administration of Work Safety
said on its  website . Initial investigations show illegal mining
caused the explosion, Xinhua reported today.  China plans to shut about 20,000 unlicensed mines by 2015,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported Sept. 19, citing Yang
Dongliang, director of the work safety administration.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
