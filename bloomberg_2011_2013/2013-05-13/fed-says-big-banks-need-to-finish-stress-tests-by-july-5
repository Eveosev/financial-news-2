The  Federal Reserve  said the 18
biggest U.S. banks need to submit the results of their own
midyear stress tests to the Fed by July 5 in compliance with
requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act.  “In the midyear test, which is being conducted for the
first time in 2013, each firm develops its own baseline,
adverse, and severely adverse scenarios to best reflect its
individual operations and risks,” the Fed said today in a press
release in  Washington .  The Fed released in March the results of an annual
supervisory test of the banks based on scenarios developed by
the central bank. The Fed said 17 of the 18 largest U.S. banks
could withstand a deep recession and maintain their capital
levels above a regulatory minimum.  The Fed said banks are required to release the results of
the severely adverse scenario between Sept. 15 and Sept. 30.  “ Federal Reserve (FDTR)  supervisors will incorporate the midyear
stress tests into their ongoing assessment of the firms, but
will not be measuring the stress test results against specific
capital regulatory minimums,” the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
