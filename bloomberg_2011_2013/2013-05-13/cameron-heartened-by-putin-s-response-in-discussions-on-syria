U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ,
heading to the U.S. for a three-day visit, said he was “very
heartened” by Russian President  Vladimir Putin ’s response
during talks on Syria that the pair held May 10.  “I was very struck in my conversations with President
Putin that there is a recognition that it would be in all our
interest to deliver a safe and secure Syria with a democratic
and pluralist future, and end the regional instability,”
Cameron told reporters traveling with him to Washington. “We
have a long way to go, but they were good talks.”  Cameron and Putin met in the southern Russian resort of
Sochi. Russia has vetoed three draft United Nations Security
Council resolutions condemning the Syrian government’s crackdown
on opponents and threatening to impose economic sanctions.
 Russia  argued the opposition was equally to blame for the
violence and that Western powers were seeking a Libya-style
regime change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
