OAO Mechel (MTL) ,  Russia ’s second-most
indebted mining company, fell from its most expensive valuation
in about a month in New York after declining production and
sales dimmed the coal producer’s earnings outlook.  American depositary receipts of  Mechel (MTLR)  slumped 6.3 percent
to $4.03 yesterday, while shares in Moscow slid for the first
time in six days. The Moscow-based company’s enterprise value,
the sum of its equity and net debt, fell to $11.64 million from
a four-week high reached last week. The Bloomberg Russia-US
Equity Index of Russian stocks in the U.S. dropped a third day,
while RTS Index  futures  slipped 0.2 percent to 139,940.  Mechel, Russia’s biggest producer of coking coal, said
yesterday that sales of the commodity used to make steel sank 11
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, while total
coal output slid 8 percent from the last three months of 2012.
Revenue for the company, whose debt is 5.8 times its market
value, will decline to a three-year low in 2013, according to
the mean of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Things will be hard for Mechel this year,” Nikolay Sosnovskiy, an analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow who has a hold
rating on the shares, said by phone yesterday. “We already knew
that coal and steel prices were falling and we now learned that
the company’s sales fell.”  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
the  stock futures , gained 1.9 percent to 20.94. The  Market
Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest exchange-traded fund dedicated
to Russian equities, slipped 1.1 percent to $27.32.  Net Loss  Mechel fell 4.7 percent to 126.60 rubles ($4.04) in Moscow
yesterday. The ADRs had the biggest drop since April 15, leading
losses on the Bloomberg Russia-US Index, which slipped 0.7
percent to 94.50.  The company reported a net loss of $1.7 billion for 2012,
compared with a profit of $727.9 million in 2011, and it also
recognized an impairment charge, according to an April 15
statement. With  $9.7 billion  of debt as of Sept. 30, Mechel is
the most-indebted Russian mining company after United Co. Rusal,
the biggest aluminum producer.  “Coking coal is the key factor for Mechel,” Vladimir Sergievskiy, an analyst at Barclays Plc in  London  who rates
Mechel sell, said by phone yesterday. “It makes no sense to own
the stock in this environment of falling coking coal prices and
an extremely high debt.”  Coking coal futures have tumbled 7.4 percent since March
25, compared with a 3.3 percent decline of the S&P GSCI gauge of
24 commodities.  Mechel’s ADRs are rated sell by 36 percent of 23 analysts
covering the stock, the most since 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Mechel is down 42 percent this year as
the Bloomberg Russia-US gauge fell 4.8 percent.  Lukoil Gains  OAO Lukoil, Russia’s biggest non-government oil producer,
rose 0.7 percent to $64.10 in New York after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said the stock is a “top pick” among shares in Central
and Eastern Europe,  Middle East  and  Africa . OAO Gazprom Neft
gained 0.2 percent to $20.66 after Goldman Sachs raised the
stock to buy from neutral yesterday.  Crude for June delivery lost 0.9 percent to $95.17 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday. Brent for May
settlement dropped 1 percent to $102.82 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Urals crude , Russia’s major
export blend, slid 1.2 percent to $101.52.  Ruble futures showed the currency weakening 0.2 percent to
31.70 per dollar in U.S. hours. Russia’s ruble was little
changed at 31.3475 per dollar yesterday and gained 0.1 percent
to 35.5516 against the dollar-euro basket used by the central
bank to manage swings that erode exporter competitiveness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
