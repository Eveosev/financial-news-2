Yoshisada Ishide, who manages the
$9.14 billion  Daiwa SB Short-Term Australian Dollar Bond Open
Fund (22311034)  in Tokyo, comments on Australia’s dollar and central bank.  Traders reduced bets on how much the  Reserve Bank  will cut
interest rates after the Australian dollar fell below $1 last
week, making the nation’s goods cheaper to overseas buyers.  A currency rate of 70 U.S. cents to 80 U.S. cents is “fair
value,” Ishide said. The RBA will keep cutting rates as central
banks around the world try to reduce borrowing costs, he said.  “The RBA has to follow this momentum. The priority is
currency policy. A declining Aussie dollar is a top priority.
Currency players are negative on the Aussie dollar because they
recognize that there will be further rate cuts. I expect
Governor Stevens still feels that the Australian dollar is still
very high.”  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
