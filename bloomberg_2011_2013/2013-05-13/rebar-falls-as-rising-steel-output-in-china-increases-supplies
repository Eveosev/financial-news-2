Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
in  Shanghai  as rising output from Chinese  steel mills  last month
added to supply of the building material.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to 3,622 yuan ($589) a
metric ton before trading at 3,631 yuan at 9:47 a.m. local time.
The most-active contract climbed 1.6 percent last week, the
first weekly gain since April 12.  China ’s daily crude steel output during April 21-30 is
estimated to have risen 0.6 percent to 2.13 million tons
compared with the daily output in the middle of April, the
official Xinhua News Agency said on May 8, citing the China Iron
and Steel Association.  “There’s supply-side pressure unless demand comes up
faster,” said Li Meng, an analyst at Huatai Great Wall Futures
Co., by phone from Shanghai. “If we get good economic data
releases today such as industrial production and fixed asset
investment, then rebar prices may strengthen.”  The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.3 percent to 3,584
 yuan  a ton on May 10, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port fell 0.5 percent
to $129.60 a ton on May 10.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
