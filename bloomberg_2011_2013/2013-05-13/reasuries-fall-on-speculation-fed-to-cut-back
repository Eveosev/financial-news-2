Treasury 10-year yields reached the
highest level in almost seven weeks after a report showed U.S.
retail sales unexpectedly increased in April, renewing optimism
central-bank efforts to spur economic growth are working.  U.S. 10-year benchmark yields rose for a third day as
European policy makers expressed a willingness to consider more
ways to spur growth following weekend talks of the Group of
Seven. A report May 17 is forecast to show consumer sentiment in
May climbed to the highest level this year.  “Ten-year notes will go to 2 percent in the short term,
the next two to three months,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of
Treasury trading at Bank of  Nova Scotia  in  New York , one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “There’s still more
data to go, but the Fed is getting a little nervous. They may
start tapering in the next three months.”  The U.S. 10-year  yield  increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.92 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2023 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to
98 15/32. It earlier climbed to 1.94 percent, the highest level
since March 26. The yield increased 16 basis points last week.  Market Measure  The 14-day relative strength  index  for the 10-year note
reached 68. A level above 70 suggests the yield may be poised to
change direction. It was at 53 a week earlier.  Treasuries have lost 0.9 percent this month through May 10,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, following
three months of gains.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in 10-year note  futures  in the week
ending May 7, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Speculative long positions or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 37,956 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Net-long positions fell by 94,088 contracts, or
71 percent, from a week earlier, resulting in the biggest
reduction in net longs since March.  “It’s the wave of short-term positive economic sentiment
that’s continuing here,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.
“We’re likely to see some value buying as the 10-year comes in
the mid-1.90 percent area, 1.94 percent is where buying is
likely to step in.”  Key Levels  U.S. 10-year yields are above the so-called upper
 Bollinger-band level  of 1.88 percent, suggesting the increase in
rates is about to end. The bands gauge volatility by plotting
standard deviations above and below a moving average. Analysts
use them to determine a probable range for a rate or security.  The Fed said after a policy meeting on May 1 it will keep
buying bonds “until the outlook for the labor market has
improved substantially.” It also left unchanged a statement
saying it plans to hold its target interest rate near zero as
long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and the outlook
for inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
each month to support the economy by putting downward pressure
on borrowing costs. There will be no purchases today. Fed buying
resumes tomorrow as the Fed will purchase up to $3.5 billion in
securities maturing between May 2020 and February 2023.  Economic Data  U.S. economic growth quickened to 2.5 percent in the first
three months of the year from 0.4 percent in the final quarter
of 2012. The  unemployment rate  fell to a four-year low of 7.5
percent in April.  Retail sales rose by 0.1 percent, compared with a drop of
0.4 percent the previous month. Purchases excluding automobiles
and gasoline rose by 0.6 percent. The median forecast of 81
economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted retail sales
would drop by 0.3 percent in April from the previous month.  “Economics now matter,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed
income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., one of
21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “Retail sales were
better than expected and that may have led to the market going
to higher yields.”  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment rose to 77.8 in May from 76.4 a month
earlier, according to the median projection in a Bloomberg News
survey of 65 economists before the report May 17.  Trading Pace  Trading volume dropped 33 percent to $302 billion from $450
billion on May 10, the highest level since Feb. 1, according to
ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government
debt . The average daily volume for this year is $281 billion.  Volatility rose for a second day. Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s MOVE index measuring price swings in Treasuries
increased to 56.51 basis points, from 55.32 basis points on May
10, after falling May 9 to an all-time low of 48.87 basis
points. The measure averaged 62.6 basis points during the past
12 months.  Euro-area finance ministers and central bankers left talks
at the G-7 meeting at Aylesbury, near  London , signaling they’re
poised to scale back austerity and are open to increased
monetary aid. European officials will meet in Brussels today to
discuss the economy and review aid payments for crisis-struck
nations such as Greece and  Spain .  To contact the reporter on this story:
