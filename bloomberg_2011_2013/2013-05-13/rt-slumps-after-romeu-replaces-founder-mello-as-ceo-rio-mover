HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA , the
Brazilian oil and natural gas explorer focused mainly on the
Amazon and  Namibia , dropped the most in eight months after its
founder and chief executive officer resigned.  The stock tumbled 14 percent to 3.97 reais at 1:09 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. Earlier the shares fell 15 percent, the most since
Sept. 10. The Rio de Janeiro-based company is down 83 percent
since its Oct. 25, 2010 initial public offering.  Marcio Mello, who founded HRT as an oil-service company
before transforming it into an oil and gas explorer, announced
his resignation on May 10, after markets closed. Mello had
stepped down as chairman of HRT April 4, after the company’s
board split the position from the CEO position. He will be
replaced by Milton Romeu Franke, HRT’s head of engineering,
drilling and production, according to a statement released
today.  HRT has failed to find oil in the Amazons, as Mello has
repeatedly said it will, and has yet to find crude off the coast
of Namibia. The company last week announced the $135 million
acquisition of  BP Plc (BP/) ’s 60 percent stake in the offshore Polvo
field in  Brazil , which produces about 13,000 barrels of oil a
day and will provide the company with revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
