Peter Randall, the former chief
executive officer of Equiduct Systems Ltd., is in the early
stages of examining a private-equity-financed bid for  NYSE
Euronext (NYX) ’s European equity exchanges, according to a person
familiar with the plans.  Randall would need confirmation from NYSE that the Euronext
business is for sale, according to the person, who declined to
be identified as the information isn’t public. The New York-based exchange agreed to be bought by IntercontinentalExchange
Inc. last year and has said it will hold an initial public
offering for Euronext, which controls bourses in Paris,
Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels.  Any approach for Euronext from private-equity companies
would probably face scrutiny by regulators and national
governments, the person said. In 2012, the European Commission
blocked Deutsche Boerse AG’s bid for NYSE Euronext, citing
concerns about competition in derivatives and clearing.  James Dunseath, a spokesman for NYSE Euronext in  London ,
declined to comment. Financial News reported Randall’s plans
earlier today.  Randall, who left Equiduct in February, brought
alternative-trading systems to  Europe  in 2007 as CEO of Chi-X
Europe Ltd. He turned Chi-X into the region’s largest so-called
multilateral trading facility, encouraging others such as
Turquoise and Bats Europe to enter the market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
