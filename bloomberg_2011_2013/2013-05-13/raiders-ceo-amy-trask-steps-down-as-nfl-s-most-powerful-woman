Amy Trask, once called the most
powerful woman in the  National Football League , stepped down as
chief executive officer of the  Oakland Raiders .  Trask said two days ago that she’s leaving after 25 seasons
now that the transition from late owner Al Davis, who died in
October 2011, to his son, Mark, is complete.  “Having honored a commitment that I made to effectuate a
smooth transition and transfer of control, I no longer wish to
remain with the organization,” Trask said in an e-mail. “For
over a quarter of a century, it was my honor and my privilege to
work for the Raiders. I will forever appreciate the opportunity
afforded me by Al Davis.”  Since interning for the franchise during law school, she
had spent all but 20 months working for the team.  “People perceive me as a business person who works in the
business of football,” Trask said in an interview with
Bloomberg in December 2010 at Raiders headquarters. “I perceive
myself as a football person who, because of gender or size,
finds myself making my contribution in the business side of
things. Football was what I wanted to do, business was my way of
making it happen.”  Trask was promoted to chief executive in 1997 by  Al Davis ,
who put her in charge of everything from sponsorships to TV
contracts to representing the club at league meetings. Sports
Illustrated called her “the most powerful woman in the NFL.”  Her only career experience outside the Raiders was 20
months at law firm  Barger & Wolen LLP  in 1985-87 in  Los Angeles .  To contact the reporter on this story:
