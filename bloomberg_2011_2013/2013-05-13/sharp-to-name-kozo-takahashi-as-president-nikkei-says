Sharp Corp. (6753) , the unprofitable
Japanese television maker, will promote Executive Vice President
Kozo Takahashi to president, replacing Takashi Okuda, the Nikkei
reported.  Okuda, who became president in April 2012, will replace
 Mikio Katayama  as chairman, the newspaper said. Sharp wasn’t the
source of the information, said  Miyuki Nakayama , a spokeswoman
at the Osaka-based company.  Okuda, 59, has sold company assets and mortgaged its
headquarters to raise funds after losses on TVs and liquid-crystal displays drove Sharp to a record 376 billion-yen ($3.7
billion) net loss in the year ended March 2012. Takahashi, 58,
is currently in charge of the company’s products business group,
which includes TV sets and mobile phones.  Sharp is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow for the year
ended March 31. The company is forecasting a record loss of 450
billion yen.  Sharp  gained  12 percent to close at 506 yen in Tokyo
trading, extending gains to 58 percent over the past six trading
days. The shares  plunged  55 percent last year.  Takahashi joined Sharp in April 1980 and previously headed
the health and environmental products division as well as the
company’s U.S. operations, according to company filings.  Sharp, which has 200 billion yen of convertible  bonds  due
this year and 360 billion yen of loans due June 30, has been
seeking investments from rivals and selling assets as its cash
pile shrinks. Sharp sold 10.4 billion yen of shares to Samsung
Electronics Co.,  Asia ’s largest electronics maker, in March.  Okuda said Feb. 1 the company aims to post net income in
the year ending March 2014. Sharp estimated operating profit
will reach 13.8 billion yen in the six months to March 31,
rebounding from a 168.9 billion loss in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
