Panasonic Corp. (6752)  surged the most in
three months in  Tokyo  trading after an analyst at Credit Suisse
Group AG estimated declines in the Japanese currency may add as
much as 30 billion yen ($294 million) to earnings this year.  The nation’s second-largest television maker  rose  7.6
percent to 806 yen at the close of trade, the biggest gain since
Feb. 4.  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.2
percent.  Panasonic last week forecast  net income  of 50 billion yen
in the 12 months ending March, compared with a loss of 754
billion yen a year earlier, as the maker of Lumix cameras
restructures to revive profit from TVs and semiconductors. The
Osaka-based company based its projection on an exchange rate of
85 yen per dollar, compared with 101.94 yen at 10:41 a.m.  “The current forex rates imply an upside of 30 billion
yen,” Shunsuke Tsuchiya, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Tokyo
who recommends buying the stock, said in a report to clients.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest TV maker, rose as much as 6.8
percent while Sharp Corp., the third-largest, jumped as much as
16 percent.  Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga plans to spend 250
billion yen on restructuring during the next two years, adding
to the 1.1 trillion yen spent since 2011. Full-year operating
profit for the maker of Viera televisions will rise 55 percent
to 250 billion yen, it said May 10.  The company expects its television losses to narrow to 34
billion yen this year from a loss of 88.5 billion yen. TV sales
will fall 16 percent to 11.5 million units this year, Panasonic
said.  Panasonic, which has lost more than  1.5 trillion yen  in the
past two fiscal years, fell further behind South Korea’s Samsung
Electronics Co. and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  in the global TV market
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
