Petroleo Brasileiro SA sold $11
billion of bonds abroad today, the most ever for an emerging-market issuer, as it seeks to develop the biggest offshore oil
find in the Americas in more than 30 years.  Petrobras, as the Brazilian state-run oil producer is
known, issued fixed-rate bonds due in three, five, 10 and 30
years as well as three- and five-year floating-rate notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sale tops the
company’s $7 billion offering last year as the largest ever
emerging-market corporate dollar-denominated deal.  The world’s biggest producer in waters deeper than 1,000
feet (305 meters) plans to borrow $20 billion this year through
bond sales and loans to help finance the oil industry’s biggest
investment plan, Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said
April 29. The sale is the fifth-largest dollar-denominated
corporate  bond issue  ever and the second-biggest this year after
Apple Inc.’s $17 billion offering, the data show.  “I would expect real money to show strong interest,”
Henri Alexaline, who helps manage $1 billion of fixed-income
investment at FM Capital Partners Ltd. in  London , said in an e-mail. “This will test the market appetite to some extent but
Petrobras is a well-recognized quasi-sovereign.”  Bank of America Corp., Banco do Brasil SA, Citigroup Inc.,
HSBC Holdings Plc, Itau Unibanco Holding SA, JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Morgan Stanley arranged the transaction, according to a
person familiar with the sale who asked not to be identified
because they’re not authorized to speak publicly.  Yields on $5.25 billion of 2021 dollar notes rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.99 percent at 5:30
p.m.  New York  time.  Preferred shares  fell 2.8 percent to 19.39
reais.  Fixed and Floaters  The Rio de Janeiro-based company sold $1.25 billion of
three-year fixed-rate notes to yield 175 basis points above U.S.
Treasuries. The $2 billion of five-year notes priced to yield
230 basis points over the benchmarks. The company paid 260 basis
points more than Treasuries on $3.5 billion of 10-year notes and
265 basis points more on $1.75 billion of 30-year securities,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Petrobras priced $1 billion of three-year floating-rate
securities at 162 basis points over the three-month Libor rate
and $1.5 billion of five-year notes at 214 basis points over
Libor.  Petrobras is seeking to finance a five-year, $237 billion
spending and investment plan. The company has $74.2 billion in
net debt, 10 times the amount for Irving, Texas-based Exxon
Mobil Corp. The company has already raised $7 billion this year
from bank loans.  The producer is rated BBB by  Standard & Poor’s , the second-lowest investment grade rating, in line with  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
