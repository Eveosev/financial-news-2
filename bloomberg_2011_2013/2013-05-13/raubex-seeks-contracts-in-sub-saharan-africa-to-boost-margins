Raubex Group Ltd. (RBX) , a South African
road builder, is seeking contracts in sub-Saharan  Africa  to
offset weaker margins in its home market, Chief Executive
Officer Rudolf Fourie said.  The company is bidding for contracts in Zambia and Botswana
worth as much as 3 billion rand ($329.8 million), Fourie said in
a phone interview today from Johannesburg. South African
contracts accounted for 94 percent of revenue in the companyâ€™s
most recent fiscal year, he said.  Raubex headline earnings per share declined 10.4 percent to
158.7 cents for the 12 months through February, the company said
in a statement today. Revenue rose 12 percent to 5.64 billion
rand, while the order book increased to 5.2 billion rand from
4.6 billion rand.  The  shares  rose 1.1 percent to 19.30 rand a share by 11:14
a.m. in Johannesburg, valuing the company at 3.56 billion rand.
The stock has gained 15 percent this year, compared with a 0.1
percent decline in the 5-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Construction and
Building Materials Index .  Raubex has made a provision to pay a 58.8 million rand fine
as part of a regulatory probe into price-fixing and collusion in
the South African  construction industry , the company said.
Eighteen companies have admitted to the practice, Economic
Development Minister  Ebrahim Patel  said on May 7.  Raubex said last month it would pay 120 million rand to buy
construction supplier Tosas Holdings from Sasol Oil Pty Ltd. The
company hopes to add two more acquisitions by the end of fiscal
year 2013-2014, Fourie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
