Glencore Xstrata Plc failed to buy
 North Sea  Forties crude even after raising its bid.  Eni SpA (ENI) 
bought Russian Urals blend at a bigger discount to Dated Brent
in northwest  Europe .  Bharat Petroleum Corp. bought 2 million barrels of Nigerian
crude for loading in July from Glencore via a tender, said two
traders who asked not to be identified because the information
is confidential.  North Sea  Glencore didn’t manage to buy Forties for loading June 1 to
June 3 at 5 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, up from its
bid at minus 8 cents on May 10, a Bloomberg survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.  China National United Oil Corp., or Chinaoil, was unable to
sell Forties lot F0517 for May 24 to May 26 at 40 cents less
than Dated Brent, the survey showed. This cargo was deferred for
a second time by four days, said two people who asked not to be
identified as the information is confidential.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA failed to buy Oseberg or Ekofisk
for June 2 to June 4 at 70 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent,
20 cents higher than its bid on May 10, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell by 3 cents to a discount of 16 cents a barrel
to Dated Brent.  Brent for June settlement traded at $102.72 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $101.99 in the previous session. The July contract was at
$102.52 at the same time today, a discount of 20 cents to June.  Buzzard share in Forties increased to 42 percent in the
week to May 12, compared with 27 percent a week earlier,  BP Plc (BP/) 
says on its website.  Forties daily output is forecast at 480,500 barrels in May,
475,700 barrels in June, 446,200 barrels in July and 300,000
barrels in August, according to BP.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni bought 100,000 metric tons of Urals for May 30 to June
3 loading from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at 95 cents a barrel less
than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the Platts
survey showed. That compares with a discount of 90 cents for a
trade on May 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vitol Group didn’t manage to sell 140,000 tons of Urals for
May 26 to May 30 at 20 cents less than Dated Brent, on a
delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , according to the survey.  Urals in the Mediterranean fell by 5 cents to a discount of
9 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at 81 cents a
barrel compared with 68 cents on May 10.  “In the future, the discounts of Urals to Dated Brent are
going to be narrower” because  Russia  reduces exports from the
 Black Sea , Arsenije Dusanic, an analyst at JBC Energy GmbH, said
at the Platts Crude Oil Summit in London today.  An unassigned 100,000 ton shipment for May 27 to May 28
loading from Ust-Luga and another 140,000 ton cargo from OAO
Lukoil for May 23 to May 24 from Novorossiysk were dropped from
the loading program, according to three people with knowledge of
the loading program.  OAO Tatneft took the Primorsk position for May 21 to May 22
loading that had been unassigned in final loading program,
people said.  Exports from Novorossiysk were revised to 2.82 million tons
in May while loadings for Ust-Luga now stood at 2.1 million
tons, according to the program.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 10 cents to $3.30
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed.  Bharat Petroleum,  India ’s second-largest state refiner,
purchased about 1 million barrels each of Qua Iboe and Agbami
grades, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
