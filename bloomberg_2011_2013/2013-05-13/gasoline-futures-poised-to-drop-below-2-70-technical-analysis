Gasoline may drop below $2.70 a
gallon after failing to break above the 200-day moving average
last week, according to a  technical analysis  by T&K Futures &
Options Inc.  Futures may slip to $2.6879 a gallon, the intraday low on
May 1 when futures sank to the least since Dec. 18’s $2.659.  Gasoline settled below the 200-day average at $2.8885, a
key technical resistance level, on May 10 after briefly trading
above it the previous day for the first time in a month.  “The 200-day is the ultimate trend change where something
goes from bullish to bearish long term,”  Michael Smith ,
president of T&K in Port Saint Lucie,  Florida , said in an
interview yesterday. “Friday, you had a failed rally attempt
above the 200-day, which is very strong resistance.”  To reverse the downtrend, gasoline would have to settle
above the 200-day average for several consecutive days, Smith
said. If it can’t, it would be poised to test the May 1 low.  The front-month contract has made a series of lower highs
and lows, Smith said, since reaching $3.2672 on March 11. The
latest high was on May 9, when it touched $2.8884.  The June gasoline contract fell 2.48 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to settle at $2.8603 a gallon May 10 on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
