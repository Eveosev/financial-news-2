U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened to
the lowest level in almost three weeks as Phillips 66 restarted
its Sweeny,  Texas , refinery and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  returned a
unit to service at its Baytown plant, also in Texas.  Phillips 66’s 247,000-barrel-a-day Sweeny refinery is in
the process of starting units after a  power failure  caused a
temporary shutdown of the plant on May 11, according to  Rich Johnson , a company spokesman. Restart is expected to “take
several days,” he said in an e-mail.  Exxon’s  Baytown plant , the second-largest refinery on the
U.S. Gulf Coast, started the No. 1 feed pump at a hydrocracker
after an earlier shutdown, according to a filing with the Texas
Commission of Environmental Quality. With the capacity to
process 584,000 barrels a day, the refinery is second to Motiva
Enterprises LLC’s 600,000-barrel-a-day Port Arthur, Texas,
plant.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast weakened 0.38 cent to 18.38 cents a gallon below futures
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:05 p.m., the biggest
discount since April 23, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region was unchanged
for a second day at a discount of 3.5 cents a gallon to futures.  Gasoline Supplies  Stockpiles of motor fuel on the Gulf, known as PADD 3,
climbed  919,000 barrels  to 72.6 million in the week ended May 3,
according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.
Supplies of distillates, including diesel and heating oil, in
the region grew 81,000 barrels to  36.3 million , the data show.  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Sweeny refinery distributes refined products
throughout the central and southeastern U.S. by pipelines, barge
and rail car, according to the company website. The Baytown
plant supplies gasoline to Texas and most states on the U.S.
East Coast via pipeline, an Exxon fact sheet shows.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate crude oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, fell 6 cents
to $21.19 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil gained 33 cents to
$12.37 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
