The difference in yield between
 Indonesia ’s two- and 10-year bonds narrowed to the least since
February after the government spelled out its plans for fuel
subsidies, easing concerns about inflation.  Coordinating Minister for the Economy Hatta Rajasa said
April 30 the government intends to raise the subsidized fuel
price to 6,000 rupiah a liter, from 4,500 rupiah. Such a move
will benefit the balance of payments and the rupiah,  Bank
Indonesia  Governor Darmin Nasution said last week.  Global funds 
added 2 trillion rupiah ($205 million) to their sovereign debt
holdings this month through May 8, finance ministry data show.  “With more certainty on the fuel-policy adjustment, there
is less investor concern over potential inflation,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, head of treasury research at PT Bank Negara
Indonesia in Jakarta. “The rupiah has found stability near this
range, which also boosts confidence.”  The yield spread shrank 20 basis points this month to 95
in Jakarta, the least since Feb. 25, according to prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association. It was as high as 121 as
recently as May 2. The rate on 10-year notes dropped six basis
points this month to 5.44 percent, the lowest since March 13.  Consumer prices  rose 5.57 percent last month from a year
earlier, slowing from a 22-month high of 5.9 percent in March,
official data showed May 1. Bank Indonesia meets on  interest
rates  tomorrow, with all 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
predicting the  reference rate  will be left at 5.75 percent.  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,740 per dollar as of
10:32 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show, 0.3 percent stronger than 9,769 on one-month
non-deliverable forwards. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 5.89
percent.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,741 today, compared with 9,738 on May 10 by the Association of
Banks in  Singapore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
