Eleven cases of the 2010 vintage from
Chateau Pichon-Longueville, a Pauillac wine estate, sold for
1,375 pounds ($2,140) each on the London-based Liv-ex market in
the past week, its lowest level for five months.  The price on the trades, which took place between May 8 and
May 10, was 25 percent down from the peak of 1,845 pounds a case
touched on Liv-ex in February, Liv-ex data on its Cellar Watch
website showed. The vintage traded at a low of 1,158 pounds a
case in October.  The 2010 vintage is rated one of Pichon-Longueville’s top
four of the past 30 years by U.S. critic  Robert Parker , on a
similar level to its 1990s and 2000s and close to matching the
2009s which immediately preceded it. The price decline followed
a 1.3 percent drop in the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index in April,
after four consecutive months of gains.  Pichon-Longueville is owned by Axa Millesimes, the wine
investment arm of Paris-based insurer  Axa SA (CS) , and run by
managing director Christian Seely.  Parker described the 2010 vintage as “full-bodied and
opulent, with relatively high tannins,” in a Wine Advocate note
from February, ranking it a 97+ on his 100-point scale. It is
the most expensive of the estate’s wines since the 1990 vintage
in merchant retail listings tracked by Liv-ex.  Pichon-Longueville has 73 hectares (180 acres) planted to
vines, of which 40 hectares are used for its main wine. Its
vineyard comprises 65 percent  Cabernet Sauvignon  grapes with the
remainder Merlot. The chateau was built in 1851 and the estate
was ranked a second-growth producer in the Bordeaux 1855
classification.  To contact the reporter on this story:
