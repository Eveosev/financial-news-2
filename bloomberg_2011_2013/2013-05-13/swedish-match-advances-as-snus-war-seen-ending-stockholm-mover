Swedish Match AB (SWMA)  rose to its highest
level in more than six months in Stockholm trading after Nordea
Bank AB said the Swedish price war on snus will probably end and
advised clients to buy the shares.  The  stock advanced  as much as 5.7 kronor, or 2.3 percent,
to 249.7 kronor, its highest intraday level since Oct. 29 last
year. It traded 0.6 percent higher at 245.5 kronor as of 12:01
p.m. local time, with trading volume at about 58 percent of the
daily average in the past three months.  Stellan Hellstroem, an analyst at Nordea, raised his
recommendation on Swedish Match to buy from hold and lifted his
price estimate to 280 kronor from 225 kronor.  Imperial Tobacco
Group Plc (IMT)  and  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  have planned list
price increases for low-price snus brands by between 1 krona and
1.4 kronor per can and  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  will probably do the
same, Hellstroem wrote in a note to clients today.  “After the recently announced list-price increases by two
of Swedish Match’s three key competitors in the Swedish snus
market, we foresee a dramatic increase in the likelihood of the
price war ending within the next few quarters,” Hellstroem
said. “Given a probable return of pricing in the Swedish snus
market, we believe the share is set for a further rerating.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
