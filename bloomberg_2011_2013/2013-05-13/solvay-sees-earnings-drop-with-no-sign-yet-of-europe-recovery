Solvay SA (SOLB) , the chemical company
created 150 years ago to produce soda ash, signaled that a lack
of recovery in Europe will hurt earnings this year amid reduced
demand for soda ash and plastics and lower sales of carbon
credits.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization
and one-time items will surpass last year’s 1.88 billion euros
($2.44 billion) which excludes a 190 million-euro windfall from
inflated guar prices and larger quantities of emission credits,
the Brussels-based company said today in a statement. That
compares with analyst projections of 2.01 billion euros, the
average of 22  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Solvay said it’s not seeing any significant improvement in
European demand for the glass-making ingredient soda ash, for
polyamide fibers or rare earths used in light bulbs after first-quarter Ebitda fell 12 percent to 454 million euros. Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Pierre Clamadieu is making Solvay less
cyclical and less reliant on  Europe  with an agreement to sell
the company’s European vinyls and chlor chemicals businesses to
Ineos Group Holdings within four to six years after the
establishment of a joint venture planned later this year.  “Solvay is likely to have suffered from its exposure to
European automotive and construction,” Filip De Pauw, an
analyst at ING Groep NV in Brussels, wrote in an investor note
last week as he cut his projection for 2013 Ebitda by about 8
percent to 1.94 billion euros.  Net debt rose to 1.31 billion euros as of March 31, a 188
million-euro increase from the end of last year as inventories
swelled because Solvay’s plants produced more vinyls in
anticipation of scheduled maintenance at large sites later this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
