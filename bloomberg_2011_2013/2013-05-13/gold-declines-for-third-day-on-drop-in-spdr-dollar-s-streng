Gold futures fell, capping the
longest slump in five weeks, as holdings in exchange-traded
products backed by the metal extended a decline to the lowest
since July 2011.  As of May 10,  assets  in ETPs dropped 0.6 percent to 2,228
metric tons, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last
month, gold futures tumbled into a bear market, and a record
$17.9 billion was erased from the value of the funds.  “Without an end to this persistent ETF liquidation, the
upside for gold in our opinion is severely constrained,” Marc Ground, a commodity strategist at Standard Bank Plc in
Johannesburg, said in a report. “Clearly, the futures market is
not convinced that gold can sustain significant upside.”  Gold futures for June delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,434.30 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price declined for the third straight session, the
longest slump since April 4. The metal has tumbled 14 percent
this year.  Speculators held 67,374 so-called short contracts on May 7,
6.4 percent more than a week earlier, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data showed on May 10. The net-long position
dropped 10 percent to 49,260 futures and options.  “Investors are losing interest in gold,” said Sun Yonggang, a macroeconomic strategist at Everbright Futures Co.,
a unit of one of  China ’s largest state-owned investment
companies.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$23.696 an ounce on the Comex. The price has dropped 22 percent
this year.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, palladium futures for
June delivery advanced 1.8 percent to $718.70 an ounce.  Platinum futures for July delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$1,484.50 an ounce. Trading was 46 percent lower than the
average in the past 100 days, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
