The baht strengthened, snapping a
two-day slide, as the governor of  Thailand ’s central bank said
steps to slow the currency’s gains were not discussed at a
meeting with government officials.  Governor  Prasarn Trairatvorakul , Bank of Thailand monetary
policy committee members and representatives of the government
and private sector were at the meeting today. Finance Minister
Kittiratt Na-Ranong, who has repeatedly called for a cut in
borrowing costs to stem fund inflows, attended as well. The baht
reached a 16-year high last month as monetary easing in
developed nations increased the flow of funds to  emerging
markets .  “Concerns that they will announce something from today’s
meeting, which has put downward pressure on the baht since late
last week, eased just for now, helping it rebound,” said Toyomu Chihaya, assistant general manager of the Bangkok treasury
department at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “It doesn’t mean the
baht will continue to advance from here. There remains some
concern about measures to stem the appreciation.”  The currency climbed 0.3 percent to 29.68 per dollar as of
1:54 p.m. in Bangkok, after slipping 1.4 percent in the two days
through May 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched a two-month low of 29.85 earlier.  The baht is still up 3 percent this year, making it the
best performer among  Asia ’s 11 most-traded currencies. It
reached 28.56 on April 22 and April 19, the strongest level
since July 1997.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, slumped 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.31 percent.  Four Measures  Governor Prasarn said the central bank’s rate-setting
committee will meet on May 29 as scheduled, ruling out a special
session. No one put pressure on the central bank to move on the
policy rate at today’s meeting, he told reporters in Bangkok.  Narongchai Akrasanee, a member of the monetary policy
committee, said four measures proposed to help stem capital
inflows are sufficient. Finance Minister Kittiratt said the
measures should be considered “carefully” and that lowering
the key rate is just one option.  Thailand’s  benchmark interest rate  of 2.75 percent compares
with a maximum of 0.25 percent in the U.S. and 0.1 percent in
 Japan . It is lower than  Indonesia ’s 5.75 percent, the
Philippines’ 3.5 percent and  Malaysia ’s 3 percent.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 rose two basis points to 3.36 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The rate reached 3.33 percent on May 10, the
lowest level since February 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
