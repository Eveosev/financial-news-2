Brazil ’s deputy Finance Minister
Nelson Barbosa, a key aide to Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, is leaving his position in June for “personal
reasons,” according to the ministry’s emailed statement.  Dyogo Oliveira, the ministry’s deputy executive-secretary,
will be interim deputy Finance Minister, according to today’s
