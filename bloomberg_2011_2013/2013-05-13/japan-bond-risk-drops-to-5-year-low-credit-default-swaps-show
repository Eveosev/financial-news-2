The cost of insuring corporate bonds
against non-payment in  Japan  fell, poised for its lowest close
in five years, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 3 basis points to 71
basis points as of 9:33 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The gauge is set for its biggest one-day decline
since May 3 and its lowest close since May 21, 2008, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan increased 3 basis points to 101 basis
points as of 8:51 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The benchmark is headed for its highest
since May 6, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1.5 basis points to
100.5 as of 9:00 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The measure is poised for its highest close since
May 2, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
