Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT) , a U.K. platinum
refiner and producer of auto-catalysts, will discontinue its
annual platinum review after agreeing earlier this year to
provide  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  with market research.  The annual review published today was the companyâ€™s last,
Neil Carson, chief executive officer of London-based Johnson
Matthey, said in the city. It first produced the report in 1985.  In February, the company signed a new metal-supply deal
with Johannesburg-based Anglo American Platinum and agreed to
provide market research for a fixed fee once the current
contracts expire on Dec. 31.  Johnson Matthey will publish a final, interim review in
November, Investor Relations Director Ian Godwin said by
telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
