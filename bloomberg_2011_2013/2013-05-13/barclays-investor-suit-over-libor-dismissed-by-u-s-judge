Barclays Plc (BARC)  won dismissal of a
lawsuit by holders of its American depositary receipts who
claimed the U.K. bank misled shareholders about its manipulation
of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor.  U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin today dismissed the
suit, filed last year, on behalf of a class of investors who
bought Barclays’s ADRs between July 10, 2007, and June 27, 2012.
She said the alleged misstatements didn’t violate the law or
lacked a sufficient connection to Barclays’ practices with
regard to Libor.  The investors, led by the Carpenters Pension Trust Fund of
St. Louis and St. Clair Shores Police & Fire Retirement System,
claimed Barclays violated U.S. securities laws through
misstatements in financial filings, in a conference call with
analysts and in the rates it submitted for use in setting Libor.
The plaintiffs also claimed Barclays failed to disclose
contingent liabilities as required by regulators.  The case is Gusinsky v. Barclays Plc, 12-cv-5329, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
