U.K. stocks  declined, snapping a
seven-day winning streak for the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) , as  Standard
Chartered  Plc and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  led shares lower.  Standard Chartered slipped 3.7 percent as Carson Block, the
short seller who runs Muddy Waters LLC, said he’s betting
against the lender’s debt. HSBC dropped 1.2 percent.  Lonmin Plc (LMI) 
gained 5.7 percent after the world’s third-largest platinum
producer unexpectedly reported a first-half profit.  The FTSE 100 Index fell 0.3 percent, or 18.91 points, to
6,606.07 at 8:43 a.m. in London. The equity benchmark climbed
for a seventh day on Friday, extending its highest level since
October 2007. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also lost 0.3
percent today. Ireland’s ISEQ Index was little changed.  European finance ministers will meet in Brussels at 3 p.m.
today to review programs for Cyprus and  Spain  and may sign off
on aid payments to Greece.  A report on May 15 may show that the euro region is
suffering the longest recession since the single currency’s
creation.  Gross domestic product  in the 17-nation economy fell
0.1 percent in the first three months of 2013, a sixth straight
quarterly decline, according to the median of 39 economists’
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. That would exceed the 15-month long contraction in 2008-2009.  The Confederation of British Industry, Britain’s biggest
business lobby group, said company sentiment on the economic
outlook has improved as it maintained its forecast for growth to
pick up over the next two years. The CBI published quarterly
forecasts today showing that the economy will expand 1 percent
this year and 2 percent in 2014, the same as it estimated in
February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
