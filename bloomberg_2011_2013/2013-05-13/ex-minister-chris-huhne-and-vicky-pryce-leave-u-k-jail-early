Chris Huhne, the former energy
secretary who aspired to lead his Liberal Democrat Party, left
prison today after serving two months of an eight-month sentence
for lying about a driving offense.  Huhne was jailed on March 11 for perverting the course of
justice after lying about who was driving his car when it was
caught on camera speeding in 2003. His ex-wife, economist Vicky Pryce, who claimed she was behind the wheel, received the same
prison term.  Today, Huhne left Leyhill Prison in Gloucestershire,
 England , television pictures showed. Pryce earlier emerged from
East Sutton Park Prison in Kent, southern England, chased by
photographers. Both will wear electronic tags as part of their
early release.  Pryce was found guilty by a jury of perverting the course
of justice for taking Huhne’s penalty points when they were
married so he could avoid losing his license. After Huhne left
her for an aide, Pryce sought revenge by telling the story to
the Sunday Times.  After pleading guilty in February, Huhne resigned from the
House of Commons. The Liberal Democrat quit his post in Prime
Minister David Cameron’s Cabinet after being charged in February
2012, initially claiming he was innocent.  Under English law, offenders serving sentences of less than
a year are automatically released after serving half their time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
