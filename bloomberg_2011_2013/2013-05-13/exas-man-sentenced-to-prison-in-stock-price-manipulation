A Texas man was sentenced today in
federal court in Trenton,  New Jersey , to 71 months in prison for
conspiracy to manipulate stock prices through a “botnet”
network.  Christopher Rad, 44, of Cedar Park was part of what federal
officials said was an international pump-and-dump scheme that
used promotional e-mails to hype stocks in which he and other
members of the ring had shares, the U.S. Justice Department said
in an e-mailed statement. U.S. District Judge Joel A. Pisano
issued the sentence today, according to a court filing.  The e-mails were sent using global networks of hijacked
computers known as botnets, which cyber security experts say are
controlled by malicious software and used to send spam e-mails
without their owners’ knowledge.  Rad’s lawyer, Francis Montenegro, didn’t immediately return
a call seeking comment.  The case is U.S. v. Rad, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court
for District of New Jersey (Trenton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
