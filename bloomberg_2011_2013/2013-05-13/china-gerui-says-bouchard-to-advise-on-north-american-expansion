     May 13 (Bloomberg) -- China Gerui Advanced Materials Group,
a Chinese specialty steelmaker, said investor and former Shale-Inland Holdings LLC Chief Executive Officer Craig Bouchard will
advise it on expanding in  North America  and around the world.  “We plan to globalize our business through accretive
acquisitions while continuing to focus on organic growth
opportunities,” China Gerui Chairman and CEO Mingwang Lu said
in a statement today from Cambelle-Inland, Bouchard’s investment
company. “During the next few years, we will create a blend of
Chinese, American and European revenues.”  China Gerui, which is based in  Zhengzhou ,  Henan Province ,
produces steel used in the food, packaging and construction
industries, according to the statement. Cambelle-Inland said
it’s an investor in the steelmaker.  Bouchard in December stepped down as CEO of Houston-based
Shale-Inland, a steel distributor. Bouchard and his brother
James founded Esmark Inc. in 2003 and expanded the company via
acquisitions, including the hostile takeover of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., before selling it to Russia’s OAO
Severstal for about $775 million in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
