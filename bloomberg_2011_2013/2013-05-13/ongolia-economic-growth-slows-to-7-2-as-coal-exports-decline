Mongolia’s economic growth slowed in
the first quarter after coal prices fell and moderating Chinese
demand reduced the nation’s exports.  Gross domestic product, as measured by production in
constant prices, grew 7.2 percent from a year ago, the National
Statistical Office of Mongolia said on its  website today . That
compares with the 16.7 percent pace of expansion for the same
period last year and a 12.3 percent annual rate for 2012.  The  World Bank  last month cut its forecast for 2013
Mongolian economic growth to 13 percent from 16.2 percent,
citing declines in exports and foreign investment. Economic
growth in  China , which buys more than 90 percent of Mongolian
exports, slowed to 7.7 percent in the first quarter from 7.9
percent in the last three months of 2012.  Mongolia’s exports for the first four months of this year
fell 5.5 percent from a year earlier, the statistics office said
today. Shipments of coal, the nation’s biggest export, fell by
volume to 5 million tons from 5.3 million tons in the same
period in 2012, the agency said. The value of the coal exports
fell to $338.9 million from $580.3 million a year ago, according
to a statement.  The volume of copper concentrate exports was little changed
at 186,000 tons in the first four months compared to 186,500
tons a year earlier, the statistics office said. The value of
the shipments rose to $276.6 million from $269.5 million a year
ago, according to the agency.  Mongolia’s trade deficit narrowed to $528.3 million, 33.7
percent smaller than a year ago, the statistics office said.  The nation’s consumer prices rose 10.4 percent in April
from a year earlier and gained 1.1 percent from March, according
to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
