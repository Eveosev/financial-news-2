Brazil ’s real posted the only gain
against the dollar among major currencies as Petroleo Brasileiro
SA offered a record $11 billion of bonds.  The real appreciated 0.6 percent to 2.0087 per  U.S. dollar 
at 4:33 p.m. in Sao Paulo, the biggest gain on a closing basis
since April 24. Swap rates on the contract due in January 2017
declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.97
percent today.  Petrobras, as the state-run oil producer is known, is
offering fixed-rate bonds due in three, five, 10 and 30 years as
well as three- and five-year floating-rate notes, according to a
person familiar with the transaction who asked not to be
identified because terms aren’t set. The real is rallying on
speculation Petrobras will exchange some of the money it raises
into local currency, according to Joao Paulo de Gracia Correa,
currency manager at Correparti Corretora.  “The real is going against the rest of the currencies due
to expectations for Petrobras’s bond sale,” he said in a phone
interview from Curitiba, Brazil. “The market is expecting
Petrobras to exchange more dollars.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
