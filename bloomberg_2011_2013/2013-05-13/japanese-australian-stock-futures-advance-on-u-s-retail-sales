Japanese and Australian  stock   futures 
rose after a report showed U.S. retail sales unexpectedly
advanced in April, buoying the earnings outlook for Asian
exporters.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a
Japanese carmaker that gets 75 percent of its revenue overseas,
rose 1.1 percent from the closing share price in  Tokyo . Those of
 Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s biggest brokerage by market value,
gained 1.3 percent after its shares surged yesterday to the
highest level since 2008. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s
biggest oil producer, fell 0.7 percent after crude slid for a
third day.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 14,870 in Chicago yesterday compared with 14,820
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 14,850 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. The Nikkei has been the top-performing major equity gauge since mid-November, surging more
than 70 percent amid unprecedented monetary easing from the  Bank
of Japan . Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.3
percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little changed.  The U.S. retail sales report “indicates that perhaps
sequester spending cuts haven’t had a bigger impact on the
underlying economy than expected and that’s a good thing,” said
 Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment markets
research at Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which
oversees about $150 billion. “BOJ quantitative easing is still
going to have a big impact on Japanese markets, driving equities
higher and potentially driving bond yields higher.”  Retail Sales  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less that
0.1 percent today. The index was little changed in New York
yesterday even after Commerce Department figures showed U.S.
retail sales rose 0.1 percent last month after a revised 0.5
percent decline in March. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.3 percent  drop .  Futures on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index were little changed
and contracts on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies trading in  Hong Kong  added 0.1 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 10 percent this year
through yesterday compared with a 15 percent advance by the  S&P
500  and an 8.9 percent gain by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery fell 87 cents
to settle at $95.17 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S.  dropped  1.4 percent yesterday in New
York, the biggest decline in three weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
