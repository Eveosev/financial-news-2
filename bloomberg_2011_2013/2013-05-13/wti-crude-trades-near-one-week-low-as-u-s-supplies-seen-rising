West Texas Intermediate traded near
the lowest level in more than a week on forecasts that U.S.
supplies climbed to the highest since at least 1931 amid
production the IEA said is “transformative” for world markets.  Futures fell for a fourth day in  New York  on speculation
that rising supplies will counter signs of an economic recovery.
Crude inventories probably increased 450,000 barrels to 396
million in the week ended May 10, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before Energy Department data tomorrow. Growth in North
American production will be as significant for markets as
 China ’s economic boom, the  International Energy Agency  said.  “Supply-demand is skewed to the oversupply side,” said
Michael Poulsen, an analyst at Global Risk Management in
Middelfart,  Denmark . “There is currently a lot of spare
capacity and global crude overproduction. The multi-decade high
in U.S. supply will keep weighing on WTI.”  WTI for June delivery was at $94.59 a barrel, down 58
cents, or 0.6 percent, in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 1:41 p.m. London time. The volume of all
contracts traded was 5 percent above the 100-day average. Prices
fell 87 cents to $95.17 yesterday, the lowest close since May 2.  Brent for June settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange lost 70 cents and was at $102.12 a barrel. The
European benchmark grade was at a premium of $7.55 to WTI
futures. The spread was $7.65 yesterday, the narrowest based on
closing prices since January 2011.  Cushing Supplies  North America  will provide 40 percent of the world’s new
supplies to 2018 through the development of light, tight oil
from shale deposits and  oil sands , the IEA said in its medium-term market report. Global oil demand will increase by 6.1
million barrels a day, or 6.7 percent, to 96.7 million a day by
2018 as the recovery gathers pace, the Paris-based agency said.  The IEA, which also released its monthly oil market report
today, increased its forecast for global oil demand in 2013 for
the first time since January, following revisions to estimates
of German gasoil consumption.  The agency raised the 2013 estimate by a “marginal”
65,000 barrels a day, predicting that world oil use will climb
this year by 800,000 barrels a day, or 0.9 percent, to 90.6
million a day.  Product Inventories  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably shrank by  1.1 million
barrels  last week, according to the median estimate of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Distillate-fuel inventories,
including heating oil and diesel, climbed by 425,000 barrels,
the survey shows.  The  American Petroleum Institute  in  Washington  is scheduled
to release separate supply data today. The industry group
collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis from
operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Information Administration for its weekly survey.  Brent may drop below its April low of $96.75 a barrel as it
completes a technical formation known as an Elliot Wave
correction, according to Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at
CMC Markets in Sydney. The benchmark crude for half of the
world’s oil has a “potentially bearish setup” and investors
may sell contracts when prices are near the 50-day moving
average of about $105.60, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
