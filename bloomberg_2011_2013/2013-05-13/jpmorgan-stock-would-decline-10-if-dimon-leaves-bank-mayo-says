JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  shares would
probably fall by about 10 percent if Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon leaves the company, Mike Mayo, an analyst at CSLA
Ltd., said today in a research note to clients.  The lenderâ€™s market value would likely drop by about $20
billion if shareholders vote on May 21 to strip Dimon of his
chairman role and he leaves as some analysts predict, Mayo said.  The stock would suffer because the New York-based bank has
no obvious successor to Dimon, 57, who is top-ranked among large
bank CEOs, Mayo said.  JPMorgan declined 0.2 percent to $48.85 at 10:42 a.m. in
New York. The shares have gained 11 percent this year, compared
with the 14 percent  advance  of the 24-company  KBW Bank Index. (BKX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
