The trustee liquidating the Lehman
Brothers Inc. brokerage said he expects to close settlement
agreements with affiliates “in the near future” that should
enable him to pay approved customers in full.  No one in the U.S. or U.K. has challenged the pacts struck
with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Lehman Brothers
International Europe, and he doesn’t anticipate a challenge by
the May 22 deadline, he said in an appeals court filing in
Manhattan.  It will take “some time” to set aside reserves for
disputed claims before making any payout, said trustee James
Giddens. He made the statements in a letter to an appeals court
handling a separate dispute between the defunct brokerage
and London-based Barclays Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
