The premium cocoa for May delivery
commands over the July futures tripled on speculation supplies
in  Europe  will be limited before the May contract expires.  Cocoa for May delivery was 42 pounds ($54.53) a ton more
expensive than the July futures by 12:58 p.m. in London on NYSE
Liffe, up from 13 pounds on May 10 and compared with a discount
on May 8. The May contract ends trading on May 15 and the
delivery will be the next day.  “The spread should stay firm until the last trading day on
speculation of limited supplies in European warehouses,” Jerome Jourquin, head of agricultural commodity derivatives at Aurel
BGC in Paris, said by e-mail today.  Prices for near-dated contracts that are higher than later
ones is a market situation known as backwardation and may signal
limited supplies. The May contract rose 27 pounds and the July
contract was down 1 pound.  Cocoa inventories with a valid grading certificate in
warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe were 89,580 metric tons as of
April 29, exchange data showed. Beans under other categories
totaled 52,570 tons. The delivery for the expired March futures
contract was 72,350 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
