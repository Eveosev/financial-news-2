Brazil ’s real rallied the most this
month on speculation policy makers will intervene to stem its
losses after central bank President Alexandre Tombini said last
week they will do whatever is needed to slow inflation.  The real appreciated 0.6 percent to 2.0090 per  U.S. dollar 
at 3:35 p.m. in Sao Paulo after closing on May 10 at 2.0204, the
weakest level since April 23. Swap rates on the contract due in
January 2017 declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 8.98 percent today.  The real ended last week weaker than 2 per dollar as an
April trade deficit fueled speculation that the flow of dollars
into Brazil will slow. Policy makers “will do what’s needed to
consolidate inflation at lower levels this year and next,”
Tombini said in a May 10 interview with Globo television. A
central bank official in Brasilia, who asked not to be
identified because of internal policy, declined a request for
comment from  Bloomberg News .  “The market is more cautious about the possibility of the
central bank intervening,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief
strategist at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA in Sao Paulo, said in a
telephone interview. “Tombini said he’s worried about
inflation, and the market knows that the currency is an
instrument to help control price increases.”  The central bank has swung this year between selling
currency swaps to prevent the real from falling too quickly and
offering reverse currency swaps to protect exporters by reining
in gains.  Inflation Outlook  Economists covering Brazil’s economy raised their 2013
inflation forecast to 5.80 percent from 5.71 percent in the
previous week, according to the central bank’s survey of about
100 analysts published today.  Annual inflation has remained above the 4.5 percent
midpoint of the central bank’s target range of 2.5 percent to
6.5 percent since Tombini took office in January 2011. It slowed
to 6.49 percent in April after accelerating to 6.59 percent in
the previous month.  Brazil reported on May 2 a trade deficit of $994 million in
April, compared with the $950 million forecast by economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
