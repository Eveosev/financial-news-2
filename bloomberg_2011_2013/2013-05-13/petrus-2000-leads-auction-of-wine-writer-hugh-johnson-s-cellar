Three bottles of Chateau Petrus 2000
Pomerol fetched top price of 6,600 pounds ($10,100) at a sale of
U.K. wine writer Hugh Johnson’s private collection at Sworders
auction house north of  London , according to its website.  A case of Chateau Haut-Brion 1990 sold for 3,900 pounds and
12 bottles of Chateau Margaux 1996 fetched 3,800 pounds at
Sworders, based in Stansted Mountfitchet. All three lots were
within pre-sale estimates, and the amount sold totaled about
88,000 pounds.  Johnson is the author of an annual pocket guide to wine
that has been published since 1977, as well as the World Atlas
of Wine. Decanter magazine, to which Johnson contributes, said
he was selling the wine because of a move to a smaller house
closer to London from his family home of 40 years in Essex.  Tomorrow the auction focus switches to Geneva, where
Christie’s International Plc is offering 66 magnums of Chateau
Mouton-Rothschild spanning the years from 1945 to 2008, and a
further 66 bottles of the same vintages. Each vintage is
represented by one magnum and one bottle, with the exception of
1978 and 1993, which have two of each.  The 66 magnums carry a top estimate of 300,000 Swiss francs
($313,000) while the bottles are priced to fetch as much as
150,000 francs, according to Christie’s online catalog.  Later this month eleven lots of 1982 Bordeaux wines,
including eight cases of Chateau Latour and three double magnums
of Chateau Petrus, are estimated to fetch as much as 12,000
pounds each at a  Sotheby’s (BID)  sale in London.  A single bottle of Romanee-Conti 2005 Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti Burgundy carries a price tag of as much as 8,000
pounds, while a similar one from 2009 is estimated at as much as
7,500 pounds, according to Sotheby’s online catalog. Eight cases
of Latour 1996 are estimated at as much as 4,400 pounds each.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
