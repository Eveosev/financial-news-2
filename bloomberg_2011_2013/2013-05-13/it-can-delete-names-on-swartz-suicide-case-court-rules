The  Massachusetts Institute of
Technology  doesn’t have to disclose names of professors and law
enforcement agents when it releases documents related to the
case of Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide while awaiting trial
on charges of stealing electronic files.  U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton said the names of the
MIT professors and agents in documents to be produced for public
viewing could be concealed to protect them from harm, according
to a filing in  Boston  today.  “The estate’s interest in disclosing the identity of
individuals named in the production, as it relates to enhancing
the public’s understanding of the investigation and prosecution
of Mr. Swartz, is substantially outweighed by the interest of
the government and the victims in shielding their employees from
potential retaliation,” Gorton said in his order.  Swartz was arrested in 2001 and charged with unlawfully
entering MIT’s computer network and downloading more than
4 million articles and documents from journals and distributing
them for free.  Facing a possible sentence of 30 years if convicted, the
26-year-old hanged himself in his Brooklyn apartment last year.
His family blamed the university and U.S. prosecutors for his
death and sought to have the documents released without
omissions.  The criminal case was U.S. v. Swartz, 1:11-cr-10260, U.S.
District Court, District of  Massachusetts  (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
