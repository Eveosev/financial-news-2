Mexican authorities raised the alert
level for the Popocatepetl volcano near  Mexico  City after it
spewed ash, steam and gas into the air and shook the ground near
its base.  Authorities raised the alert level for the volcano, known
as “Popo,” after it showed increased activity and distributed
ash in nearby towns, according to Mexico’s National Disaster
Prevention Center. Residents near the volcano should prepare for
a potential evacuation, according to the warning.  Popocatepetl, which means “smoking mountain” in the Aztec
language, is located about 70 kilometers (43 miles) southeast of
Mexico City. At 5,426 meters high, it’s  North America ’s second-tallest volcano, according to the Washington-based Smithsonian
Institution. A 12-kilometer area surrounding the volcano has
been shut and transit between nearby towns is being controlled,
according to the agency.  “This is a prevention phase,” Puebla state Governor
Rafael Moreno said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. “There’s
no danger and the people are calm, but we should be on permanent
alert.”  Activity at Popocatepetl prompted an alert last year, when
ash fell on the towns of San Pedro Benito Juarez and Santiago
Xalitzintla. It erupted in 2003, spewing lava for one kilometer
around the snow-capped crater and bringing ash down on Mexico
City.  A shelter has been installed in the town of San Pedro
Cholula, about 20 kilometers from the volcano, and four more
shelters may be put together if conditions worsen, Dulce
Serrano, a local civil protection official, said in a telephone
interview. Surgical masks are also being distributed in Cholula
and health department mobile units are going across the villages
closer to the volcano to monitor the welfare of the inhabitants,
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
