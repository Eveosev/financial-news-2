Turkey ’s biggest wind farm, financed
with a 135 million-euro ($175 million) loan arranged by the
 European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , started
producing power as the nation seeks to curb fossil-fuel imports.  Enerjisa Enerji Uretim AS, owned by  Haci Omer Sabanci
Holding AS (SAHOL)  and EON SE, developed the Enerjisa Bares wind park in
Balikesir, western Turkey, according to a statement on the EBRD
website. The 142.5-megawatt plant can power 170,000 Turkish
homes, the EBRD said.  Turkey, which depends on fossil-fuel imports mainly from
Russia and Iran for much of its energy needs, aims to generate
30 percent of its power from renewables by 2030 and had about
2,300 megawatts of wind power installed at the end of last year,
according to the European Wind Energy Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
