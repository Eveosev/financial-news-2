Bruce Rosenblum,  Warner Bros .’ head
of television, will step down after losing a competition to
become chief executive officer of  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s entire
entertainment unit, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  Rosenblum, president of Warner Bros. Entertainment
television group, was a member of a three-person office of the
president that was set up to find a successor to Barry Meyer,
CEO of Warner Bros. Entertainment. Kevin Tsujihara won the job
in January over Rosenblum and Jeff Robinov, who leads the film
unit.  Peter Roth, who reported to Rosenblum as president of
 Warner Bros. Television , will now report to Tsujihara, said the
person, who sought anonymity yesterday because agreements hadn’t
been signed. Tsujihara, who ran the home-video business, will
succeed Meyer as Warner Bros. chairman after year-end.  The website Deadline Hollywood  reported  on May 12 that
Rosenblum won’t renew his contract expiring in August.  Paul McGuire , a spokesman for Warner Bros. Entertainment,
declined to comment, citing company policy on personnel matters.  “Obviously, I’m disappointed; who wouldn’t be?” Rosenblum
said in a January e-mail after being passed over. “Warner Bros.
is a unique and special place and I know it will be in good
hands with Kevin at the helm.”  Time Warner, based in  New York , fell less than 1 percent to
$60.91 yesterday in New York. The shares have advanced 27
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
