Ibovespa futures dropped after
homebuilder  Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  and power utility  Light SA (LIGT3)  posted first-quarter earnings that were below analysts’ estimates.  Farm company  Vanguarda Agro SA (VAGR3)  may also be active after
posting a net loss of 55.4 million reais ($27.5 million) in the
three months ending March. Oil company  HRT Participacoes em
Petroleo SA (HRTP3)  may move after Chief Executive Officer Marcio Mello
resigned.  Ibovespa futures  contracts expiring in June lost 0.3
