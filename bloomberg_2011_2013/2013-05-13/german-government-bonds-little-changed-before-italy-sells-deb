Italian and Spanish government bonds
dropped for a third day amid concern euro-area politicians will
struggle to control their debt loads after rejecting austerity
plans to concentrate on boosting growth.  German bunds rose, with  10-year yields  falling from within
a basis point of a seven-week high, before data this week that
analysts said will show the euro-area’s gross domestic product
contracted for a sixth consecutive quarter. Former European
Central Bank board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said Italy should
seek aid to support its lenders, according to a report by Ansa.
The nation auctioned 8 billion euros ($10.4 billion) of debt.  “The market is rethinking the very optimistic view” that
had pushed Italian and Spanish yields lower, said Christian Reicherter, an analyst at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “Bond
markets are also nervous ahead of the GDP data. The politicians
are still struggling to come up with further reforms of the
European economy as a whole.”  Italy’s 10-year yield rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 3.98 percent at 4:45 p.m. London time, the
highest level since April 29. The 4.5 percent bond maturing in
May 2023 fell 0.7, or 7 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
104.575. The nation’s two-year yield climbed eight basis points
to 1.36 percent.  Finance ministers and central bankers from the common
currency bloc left weekend talks of the Group of Seven signaling
that they’re poised to scale back austerity, are open to
increased monetary aid and are looking to unfreeze bank lending.
European officials will meet in Brussels today to discuss the
economy and review aid payments for crisis-struck nations from
 Greece  to  Spain .  Italian Sales  Euro-region GDP shrank 0.1 percent in the first quarter,
after contracting 0.6 percent in the previous three months, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg will say May
15, according to the median estimate of 39 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The Rome-based Treasury sold three-year securities at an
average yield of 1.92 percent, compared with 2.29 percent at a
previous sale on April 11. Investors bid for 1.34 times the
amount of securities on offer, versus 1.4 times. Italy also
allotted 1.5 billion euros of bonds due in 2026 at 4.07 percent
as well as 3 billion euros of five-year floating-rate notes at
2.44 percent.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield dropped two basis points to
1.36 percent. The rate rose to 1.39 percent on May 10, the
highest since March 25.  Spread Widens  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold
Italian 10-year securities instead of German bunds expanded 11
basis points to 262 basis points today, after shrinking to 250
basis points on May 10, the narrowest since Jan. 30.  Spanish 10-year yields climbed nine basis points to 4.29
percent.  Belgium ’s bonds were the most volatile in euro-area markets
today followed by those of Finland and Spain, according to
measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian securities returned 0.3 percent this month through
May 10, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
bonds were little changed and German debt lost 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
