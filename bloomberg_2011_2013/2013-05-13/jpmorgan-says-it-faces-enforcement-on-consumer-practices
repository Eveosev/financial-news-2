JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, said it will face enforcement action from
federal regulators over its collection practices and add-on
products commonly appended to credit cards.  The company said in a May 8 regulatory filing that it
“expects that its banking supervisors will in the future continue
to take more formal enforcement actions against the firm,”
instead of “issuing informal supervisory actions or criticisms.”  The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is conducting
an industrywide review of credit card add-on products, which can
include debt cancellation and identity theft services. New York-based JPMorgan cited an identity theft product in its filing.  Banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. stopped
offering such add-on products entirely in the face of regulatory
scrutiny. The bureau’s first enforcement action was against
 Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , which paid about $210 million in
restitution and penalties over the products.  Paul Hartwick , a JPMorgan spokesman, said the bank had no
comment on the filing.  JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets and deposits, is
facing regulatory inquiries on its trading practices and conduct
in the energy business. Shareholders are also considering at
their May 21 meeting whether to separate the chairman and chief
executive officer role, both currently held by  Jamie Dimon .  To contact the reporter on this story:
