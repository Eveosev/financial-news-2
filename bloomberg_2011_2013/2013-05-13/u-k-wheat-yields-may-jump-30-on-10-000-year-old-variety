A 10,000-year-old variety of wheat
that’s bred with a species of grass may help boost grain yields
in the U.K. by as much as 30 percent, the National Institute of
Agricultural Botany said.  Scientists at the Cambridge-based institute recreated the
variety that’s a cross between an ancient type of wheat and wild
grass, according to a  statement  on NIAB’s website today. When
bred with modern-day plants, the strain may make crops with
higher yields that are more tolerant to drought or diseases. The
U.K.’s national wheat yield has been about 8 metric tons per
hectare (2.47 acres) for the past 12 years, according to the
report.  “Yield increases of up to 30 percent have been produced in
early field trials, despite the past few years being cold, wet
seasons where lack of sunlight depressed yield,” Phil Howell, a
senior plant breeder at NIAB, said in the statement. The initial
finding “points to a major transformation in the wheat
improvement process.”  New varieties based on the findings may not be available to
farmers until at least 2019, NIAB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
