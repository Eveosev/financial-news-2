India ’s rupee fell to a 10-week low
on speculation gold importers are stepping up dollar purchases
today on Akshaya Tritiya, a festival day on which it is
considered auspicious to buy the metal.  Government bonds  gained.  Demand for gold in the world’s largest importer of the
commodity is seen at 30 metric tons today, compared with 20 tons
a year ago, said  Prithviraj Kothari , managing director of
Riddisiddhi Bullions Ltd. in Mumbai. The price of the precious
metal fell 7.8 percent last month, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Overseas investors bought a net $1.2 billion of Indian
stocks this month through May 9, exchange data show.  “We are seeing importers buying the dollar today, and also
we have the seasonal May depreciation pressure as overseas loans
are typically repayed this month,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a
trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “Even with
massive inflows the rupee is weakening, and I dread what will
happen to the currency if the inflows stop.”  The rupee declined 0.3 percent to 54.975 per dollar as of
9:48 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 54.9875 earlier, the weakest level since March 4. The
inflows should limit the currency’s drop to around 55.05,
Development Credit Bank’s Raghuvanshi said.  The rupee has fallen against the dollar in May in seven of
the last 10 years mainly due to the refinancing or repayment of
overseas loans taken at the start of the financial year that
begins April 1, he said.  Inflation Easing  Wholesale price  inflation  slowed to 5.45 percent in April
from a year earlier, after a 5.96 percent increase in March that
was the least since 2009, according to the median estimate of 29
economists in a Bloomberg survey before data due tomorrow.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell two
basis points to 7.57 percent, according to the central bank’s
trading system. That is the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year
note since July 2010.  The government may start selling a new sovereign security
maturing in 2023 this month, according to two finance ministry
officials with direct knowledge of the matter who asked not to
be identified before a public announcement.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.33 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.95 per
dollar, compared with 55.59 on May 10, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.77 versus 55.57. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
