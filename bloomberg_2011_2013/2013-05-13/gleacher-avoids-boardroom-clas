Gleacher & Co., the brokerage that’s
closing its fixed-income business, won’t face a boardroom
challenge from activist shareholder Clinton Group Inc. as the
hedge-fund firm won’t nominate its own slate of directors.  Clinton Relational Opportunity Master Fund LP failed to buy
more stock in New York-based Gleacher even after offering above-market prices, the fund said today in a regulatory filing. The
investor said it now supports the plan of private-equity firm
MatlinPatterson Global Advisers LLC, which said May 2 that
Gleacher should fire its executives and consider winding down or
pursuing a merger or sale.  Clinton Group, part of a coalition that held a 7.7 percent
stake in the brokerage as of last month, had proposed an
alternate plan to turn Gleacher into an asset manager.  Gleacher said April 10 that it’s closing the fixed-income
business, which generated most of the company’s revenue, as
salesmen defected and customers suspended trading. The brokerage
was in talks to combine with Sterne Agee Group Inc., people
familiar with the matter said at the time.  Marcia Horowitz, a Gleacher spokeswoman at Rubenstein
Associates Inc., didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-mail
messages seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
