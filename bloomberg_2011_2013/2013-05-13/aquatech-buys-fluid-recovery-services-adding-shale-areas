Aquatech International Corp., a
Pennsylvania-based water purification company, bought Fluid
Recovery Services to expand treatment services to oil and
natural gas producers in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.
Terms weren’t disclosed.  “Aquatech’s goal is to be the leader in oil and gas water
management,” Venkee Sharma, chief executive officer of the
closely held company, said in a statement today. “The
acquisition of FRS represents significant progress towards
achieving our vision.”  Oil and gas producers inject a mixture of water, chemicals
and sand into shale rock to get access to the fuel, in a process
known as hydraulic fracturing. Environmentalists say fracking
can harm drinking water supplies.  Aquatech, based in Canonsburg,  Pennsylvania , processes
almost 1 million barrels of produced water daily. Fluid Recovery
Services, based in Creekside, Pennsylvania, can treat, store,
transport and dispose of water from oil and gas operations,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
