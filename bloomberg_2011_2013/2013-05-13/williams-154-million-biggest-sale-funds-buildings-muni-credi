Williams College, ranked first among
U.S. liberal-arts schools, plans the biggest borrowing in its
220-year history as education debt trails the $3.7 trillion
municipal market by the most since 2010.  The private college, 135 miles (217 kilometers) northwest
of  Boston  in the Berkshire Mountains, is set to sell $154
million tomorrow, its first issue since March 2011, said Fred Puddester, treasurer for the school. Proceeds will refund bonds
for about $500,000 of annual savings and finance new academic
and athletic facilities, Puddester said.  Bonds for education, which includes public-school
construction debt, have earned 1.2 percent this year, lagging
behind the 1.4 percent gain for the municipal market, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch data show. While investors favor colleges’
stronger ratings, they’re drawn to weaker credits with higher
yields, said Nancy Andes, senior underwriter of fixed-rate munis
at  Wells Fargo Securities LLC  in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina .  “There’s a natural reach for yield,” Andes said.
“Typically with the higher-ed space, you get the high-quality
rating category that investors are driven towards, but then you
also have to realize that there’s a need for yield.”  Buyers’ Preference  Investors have been buying riskier securities to boost
returns as  interest rates  have fallen to generational lows. At
 3.67 percent , yields on 20-year general obligations are near a
47-year low of 3.27 percent set in December, Bond Buyer data
show.  Williams, based in Williamstown,  Massachusetts , is the
nation’s top liberal-arts college, according to an annual
ranking that U.S. News & World Report released in September. In
terms of its credit, the school is rated one step below top
securities by Moody’s Investors Service and  Standard & Poor’s .  “People are taking on credit risk,” said Ron Schwartz,
who helps manage $1.5 billion of munis at Ridgeworth Capital
Management in  Orlando ,  Florida . “And they want those extra
basis points.”  The Williams issue, through the Massachusetts Development
Finance Agency, follows sales this year by the University of
California Regents,  Harvard University  and the  University of
Chicago .  Debt Load  Colleges have taken on $7.3 billion of muni debt this year,
after $22.8 billion in 2012, the most since 2010, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Issuers that year were able to use the Build
America Bonds program, part of President  Barack Obama ’s economic
stimulus plan, which gave a federal subsidy on interest costs.
The program expired Dec. 31, 2010.  This will be Williams’s largest borrowing, with $58 million
paying for capital projects and the remainder refinancing debt,
Puddester said. The deal will include bonds maturing in 20 to 30
years, he said.  “The rates are so low out there that we just thought it
was advantageous for us to go as long as we can,” Puddester.
“It really works out to level out our debt-service payments.”  Debt sold for colleges, universities and public schools and
rated two steps below top-rated bonds is off to its worst annual
start since 2010, Bank of America data show.  Diversification Appeal  Williams should still lure buyers because it doesn’t borrow
often and the bonds can help diversify a state-specific mutual
fund, Schwartz said. Investors like college and university
borrowings because of their recognizable names, credit ratings
and endowments, he said.  “They’ll do well because it will be a different name for a
lot of different funds that need that state specialty,”
Schwartz said.  The college’s last fixed-rate borrowing was in March 2011.
Bonds maturing in July 2036 were priced to yield 4.77 percent,
or 0.15 percentage point more than benchmark munis, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Wellesley College , 12 miles west of Boston and carrying the
same credit rating as Williams, sold tax-exempt revenue debt in
March 2012. The bonds mature in July 2042 and were priced to
yield 3.65 percent, 0.2 percentage point more than benchmark
munis. Wellesley is ranked sixth on the U.S. News and World
Report list.  Endowment Financing  Williams, which enrolled 2,015 full-time undergraduates in
the 2012-2013 school year, will have about $331 million of debt
after this sale, according to Moody’s. The school had total
endowment funds of $1.72 billion as of June 30, 2012, down from
$1.74 billion the year before, according to bond documents.
Almost 50 percent of operating revenue comes from draws on the
college’s endowment, according to Moody’s.  While the school relies on endowment gains for operations,
such spending is about 5 percent of the fund’s value, Puddester
said.  “That’s been a pretty steady number over the last decade,
so we don’t anticipate that changing very much,” Puddester
said.  About half of Williams students are on financial aid, which
is supported by the school’s endowment and donors, Puddester
said.  “The average debt of a  Williams College  student when they
leave Williams College is about $9,000,” he said “We’re very
generous with our financial aid.”  Annual Cost  Still, the cost of attending the school surpasses most
American incomes. Tuition, fees, room and board totaled $56,770
for the 2012-2013 academic year, according to bond documents.
The U.S. median household income in 2011 was $50,054, according
to Census data.  While the school received 7,069 applications in 2012, down
from 7,552 in 2008, Williams accepts about 17 percent of its
candidates, according to bond documents. Of those accepted in
2012, 45.5 percent chose to attend. The median acceptance rate
for comparable schools is about 34 percent, according to
Moody’s.  “When bond buyers look at those type of statistics, they
realize that we’re just a very strong credit,” Puddester said.  Elsewhere in the local-debt market this week, Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport is set to lead issuance as munis are
at the most expensive levels since March relative to Treasuries.  At  1.79 percent , yields on benchmark 10-year munis compare
with  1.9 percent  for similar-maturity Treasuries. The ratio of
the two interest rates, a gauge of relative value between the
two asset classes, is about 94 percent, the lowest since March
11. The further the figure drops, the costlier local bonds are
compared with federal securities.  Tax-free local bonds have yielded less than Treasuries in
only six of the past 42 trading sessions, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The  ratio  has averaged 92 percent since 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
