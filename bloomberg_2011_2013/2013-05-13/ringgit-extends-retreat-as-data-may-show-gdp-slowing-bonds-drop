Malaysia’s ringgit fell for a third
day before a report this week that economists forecast will show
growth in the Southeast Asian nation slowed last quarter.
 Government bonds  rose.  The currency extended its retreat from the strongest level
in 21 months that was driven by an election win for Prime
Minister Najib Razak’s Barisan Nasional coalition on May 5. The
ringgit tracked other regional exchange rates lower as the yen
weakened past 102 per dollar for the first time since 2008. Data
last week showed Malaysian exports contracted in March for a
second month ahead of a May 15 gross domestic product report.  “The ringgit’s advance recently was overdone and they
still need the export sector to grow, so at some point the
ringgit may be too strong for its own good,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist in  Singapore  at Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp. “It’s not a problem as yet, but declines in production
and export data are a bit worrying.”  The ringgit weakened 0.1 percent to 2.9955 per dollar as of
4:15 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It gained 1.4 percent last week and touched 2.9570 on
May 7, the highest level since August 2011.  Bonds Climb  GDP probably increased  5.5 percent  last quarter from a year
earlier, versus 6.4 percent in the final three months of 2012,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
Exports shrank 2.9 percent in March from a year earlier, after a
7.7 percent contraction in February. Industrial production also
fell in March and February.  One-month non-deliverable forwards in the ringgit were down
0.1 percent at 3.0021 per dollar. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, climbed 35 basis points, or 0.35 percentage point, to
7.39 percent.  Ten-year government bonds climbed after rallying last week,
when the yield dropped 25 basis points, the biggest decline for
a benchmark note of that maturity since March 2009.  The rate on the 3.48 percent securities due March 2023
slipped one basis point to 3.13 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
