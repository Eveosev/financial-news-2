Blackstone Group LP (BX)  obtained 600
million pounds ($922 million) of debt to refinance Chiswick
Park, a west London office development it bought in 2011 for 480
million pounds.  Deutsche Bank AG provided a 400 million-pound senior loan
and Apollo Global Management LLC arranged a 200 million-pound
mezzanine facility, according to an e-mailed statement from the
German lender. There’s a mortgage-backed bond of about 302
million pounds outstanding that was arranged by Deutsche Bank
after Blackstone’s acquisition of the office park in 2011.  Buildings on the 33-acre (13 hectare) site are leased to
companies including PepsiCo Inc., Tullow Oil Plc and Walt Disney
Co., according to a  statement  on Chiswick Park’s website. Work
has begun on constructing a new 12-story building on the site,
according to today’s e-mailed statement.  Apollo’s mezzanine facility was provided on behalf of a
separate managed account, Deutsche Bank said. The Government of
Singapore Investment Corp., a sovereign wealth fund, previously
provided 60 million pounds of junior debt backed by the Chiswick
Park site, according to a  statement  on the website of law firm
SJ Berwin LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
