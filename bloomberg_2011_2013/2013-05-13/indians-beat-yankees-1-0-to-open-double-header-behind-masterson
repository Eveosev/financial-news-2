Vidal Nuno pitched five scoreless
innings in his first career start and the  New York Yankees 
defeated the Cleveland Indians 7-0 to split a doubleheader.  Jason Kipnis hit a first-inning home run and Justin Masterson pitched a four-hitter as the Indians won the opener at
Cleveland’s Progressive Field to snap New York’s five-game
winning streak with a 1-0 victory.  Nuno, 25, a left-hander, allowed three hits and three walks,
and struck out three, in his second Major League Baseball
appearance.  Vernon Wells  and Lyle Overbay each drove in two runs
for the Yankees.  In the opener, Masterson threw his second complete game
this season, allowing four hits, striking out nine and walking
three.  David Phelps threw a career-high 115 pitches for the
Yankees, also allowing four hits, while striking out seven and
walking five in 6 2/3 innings.  The Yankees (24-14) lead the American League East by a game
over the  Baltimore Orioles . The Indians (21-16) are tied with
the  Detroit Tigers  atop the AL Central.  The doubleheader was scheduled after games on April 10-11
were canceled because of bad weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
