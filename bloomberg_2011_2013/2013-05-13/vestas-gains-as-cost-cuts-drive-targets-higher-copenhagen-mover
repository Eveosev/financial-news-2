Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  jumped to the
highest price in 14 months in Copenhagen as banks raised their
share price estimates amid signs the turbine maker is succeeding
with its plan to end losses.  Vestas  surged  as much as 8.6 percent to 65 kroner, the
highest level since March 19, 2012. The stock rose 7.8 percent
to 64.50 kroner at 10:56 a.m. in the Danish capital with volume
at 105 percent of the three-month daily average.  Vestas reported a narrowing loss last week after
progressing more than half-way into a two-year program to return
to profit. The turbine maker started the initiative after
stronger competition depressed prices. Credit Suisse Group AG
said today the measures are working, and it raised its price
estimate on the share by 83 percent. The bank also raised its
recommendation for the first time in five years.  “Cost cutting is (finally) showing through,” Mark Freshney, an analyst at the bank, wrote in a note to clients.
“There is more set to come later in 2013.”  Freshney raised his price estimate to 55 kroner from 30
kroner and lifted his recommendation to neutral from
underperform. Other banks that raised their estimates after last
week’s earnings include Alm. Brand A/S, Nordea Bank AB and
Svenska Handelsbanken AB, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Vestas reported on May 8 that its net loss for the three
months ending March 31 shrank to 151 million euros ($198
million) from 162 million euros a year earlier. Free  cash flow 
rose by 235 million euros to a deficit of 60 million euros in
the quarter, according to the Aarhus, Denmark-based company.  Vestas shares gained 13 percent on the day of the earnings
report. The stock has  doubled in value  so far this year after
having declined in the previous three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
