Carlyle Group LP (CG)  bought a minority
stake in  Jordan ’s Al-Nabil Food Industries Co. as the world’s
second-largest manager of alternative assets expands.  Carlyle will hold a “significant” stake in Al-Nabil,
which produces frozen and chilled food products, while the
Rassam family that founded the company will continue to have a
majority holding, Carlyle said in an e-mailed statement today,
without disclosing financial details.  “This first investment in Jordan is in line with our
commitment to the MENA region, its industries and economy,”
Firas Nasir, co-head of the company’s MENA fund, said in the
statement. “We remain dedicated to our strategy of becoming
value-adding partners in family-owned businesses.”  Funding for the deal came from Carlyle MENA Partners, a
$500 million growth capital and buyout fund focused on  Middle
East , North Africa and Turkey. The deal closed today.  Carlyle, based in  Washington , D.C., bought a 42 percent
stake in restaurant operator Alamar Foods from Saudi Arabia’s Al
Jammaz family in December 2011. The company bought 48 percent of
the Istanbul-based education group Bahcesehir Kolejleri for an
undisclosed price, it said in January 2012. It also acquired a
40 percent stake in Medical Park, an Istanbul-based hospital
chain, in 2009 and 50 percent of Turkish shipbuilder TVK Gemi
Yapim Sanayii AS in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
