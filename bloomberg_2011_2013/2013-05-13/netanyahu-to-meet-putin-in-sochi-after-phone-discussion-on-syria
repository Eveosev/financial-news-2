Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  will fly to Russia tomorrow to meet President  Vladimir Putin  for discussions that will focus on Syria, the Kremlin
said.  The Israeli leader will meet Putin in the Black Sea city of
Sochi and return in the afternoon, an Israeli official said
today, speaking on condition of anonymity because details of the
talks were not officially announced.  The meeting will be “mainly focused on the worsening
situation in Syria,” Putin spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  said.  The U.S. has asked Russia not to sell advanced weapons
systems to the Syrian government, which has fought rebel groups
in a two-year civil war that has left more than 70,000 dead,
according to the United Nations. Syria has blamed Israel for
bombing military facilities earlier this month near Damascus.  Israel, which declined to comment on the allegation,
borders Syria. It captured Syria’s Golan Heights during the 1967
Middle East war.  Russia has vetoed three draft United Nations Security
Council resolutions condemning the Syrian government’s crackdown
on opponents and threatening to impose economic sanctions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
