The pound fell to a two-week low
against the dollar after a U.S. report showed retail sales
unexpectedly increased last month, attracting investors to
America’s currency.  Sterling dropped against 12 of its 16 major counterparts
even after a U.K. business lobby had said company sentiment
improved and growth will pick up during the next two years. The
U.S. economy expanded at eight times the rate of the U.K.’s in
the first quarter, government reports showed last month. British
government bonds were little changed before the Debt Management
Office sells 4.75 billion pounds ($7.29 billion) of five-year
gilts tomorrow.  “The dollar is catching a bid and upside in the pound will
be stretched,” said Peter Kinsella, a currency strategist at
Commerzbank AG in  London . “U.S. and U.K. growth differentials
haven’t been this extended since the mid-1980s, which was
consistent with significantly lower levels in the pound. The
price action is indicative of the pound having found a top.”  The pound dropped 0.5 percent to $1.5285 at 4:39 p.m.
London time after falling to $1.5282, the weakest level since
April 25. Sterling declined 0.3 percent to 84.85 pence per euro
after strengthening as much as 0.3 percent.  U.S. retail sales increased 0.1 percent, the Commerce
Department said in  Washington . Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast a decline of 0.3 percent. The data for March and
February were both revised higher.  Quarterly Forecasts  The Confederation of British Industry said its quarterly
forecasts showed the U.K. economy will grow 1 percent this year
and 2 percent in 2014, the same as it estimated in February.  “In the conversations I have with business leaders, I’ve
been hearing that whilst firms are on a cautious footing,
there’s a bit more confidence about the economic outlook,”
Director-General John Cridland said in London. “The right way to
judge the economy is that it’s moving from flat to growth.”  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annual
rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said April
26. U.K. GDP increased 0.3 percent in the period, the Office for
National Statistics said April 25.  The pound has strengthened 1.9 percent in the past month,
the third-best performer of 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
rose 2.3 percent and the euro gained 1.1 percent.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield was at 1.88 percent after
increasing 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, during the
previous two days. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in September
2022 traded at 98.87.  Gilts lost 1.7 percent this month through May 10, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds fell 1 percent and
Treasuries dropped 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
