A  Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  solar-thermal
plant should start up next month after missing a May deadline
because Indian authorities failed to lay a water pipeline to the
site in time, Chief Executive Officer Jayaram P. Chalasani said.  The 100-megawatt project “is ready to go” as soon as the
water arrives, Chalasani told reporters today in Mumbai. The
Rajasthan state government is completing the pipeline and the
plant should begin generating after testing, he said.  India  extended the deadline for solar-thermal plants by 10
months to March and will waive late penalties for the project
and another six developments being built by companies including
 Godawari Power and Ispat Ltd . and  Lanco Infratech Ltd. (LANCI) , he said.  Solar-thermal plants focus sunlight to produce steam and
are valued for their ability to store energy. The 470 megawatts
of projects, India’s first to use the technology, also struggled
with importing equipment and raising funds, Ministry of New and
Renewable Energy Joint Secretary Tarun Kapoor said last week.  Reliance Power, using technology from  Areva SA (AREVA) , invested 21
billion rupees ($383 million) in its project, Chalasani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
