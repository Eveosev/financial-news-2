Rick Ankiel went 0-for-3 with two
strikeouts in his debut for the  New York  Mets, a 6-3 loss to the
 St. Louis Cardinals  in which he also had a bloop hit bounce out
of his borrowed glove in center field.  Ankiel agreed on a contract with the Mets yesterday, one
week after being cut by the  Houston Astros  while batting .194.  Ankiel, a 33-year-old former pitcher whose lack of control
forced him to leave the game in 2004 and return in 2007 as an
outfielder, started in center field yesterday and hit seventh in
the Mets’ lineup. Ankiel’s equipment didn’t arrive in  St. Louis 
from Houston and he had a ball pop out of a glove belonging to
Mets pitcher Jonathon Niese as he tried to make a diving catch
on a double by Ty Wigginton to lead off the seventh inning.  The Cardinals went on to score three runs in the inning to
snap a 3-3 tie.  “I don’t want to make excuses. I do think if I have my
glove, it stays in there,” Ankiel told reporters. “But I’m the
type of person that I feel like if I got a glove on it, I should
have caught it.”  Ankiel’s five home runs in 25 games for the Astros matched
his total from last season, when he batted .228 in 68 contests
for the  Washington Nationals . He joined the Mets as a .243
career batter with 74 homers, including a high of 25 in 2008.  The Mets are 14-21, in fourth place in the National League
East, six games behind the division-leading  Atlanta Braves .
They’re 4-12 in their last 16 Major League Baseball games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
