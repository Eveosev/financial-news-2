The shekel weakened the most in more
than four months after the Bank of Israel’s surprise interest
rate cut and vow to buy as much as $2.1 billion in 2013 to curb
the currency’s appreciation. Stocks rose the most in two months.  The shekel depreciated 0.9 percent to 3.6026 a dollar, the
most since Jan. 3, at 4:09 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The currency has
strengthened 8.9 percent in the past six months, the second-best
performer after the Mexican peso among 31 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. The  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  of stocks climbed 1.2
percent, the most since March 18. Israel’s benchmark 10-year
bonds also rose.  “This is welcome news for the  capital markets ,” said
 Jonathan Katz , a Jerusalem-based economist for HSBC Holdings
Plc. “I thought the central bank would loosen monetary policy,
but this came before we expected. It complements a tightening of
fiscal policy.”  The central bank cut the benchmark lending rate by a
quarter point to 1.5 percent and announced a new program to
purchase foreign currency, according to an e-mailed statement.
The shekel’s appreciation, the start of natural gas production
from the Tamar field and interest rate cuts by regulators,
including the  European Central Bank , were cited among reasons
for the decisions.  The yield on the 4.25 percent benchmark notes due March
2023 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.49
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
