Partnership Assurance Group Plc, a
U.K. annuity provider, may be valued at “significantly” more
than 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) when it goes public next
month, Chief Executive Steve Groves said.  The insurer, which offers annuities to people with medical
conditions, will to raise 120 million pounds in the initial
public offering to pay down debt, the firm said in a statement
today. Cinven, the private-equity firm that acquired Partnership
for about 200 million euros ($259 million) in 2008, will also
sell a stake, leaving a free-float of at least 25 percent.  “I would see us positioned within the  growth stocks  in the
insurance space,” Groves said in a telephone interview today.
That would suggest a valuation of “significantly above” 1
billion pounds, he said.  The insurer is going public after motor insurer  Esure Group
Plc (ESUR)  raised 604 million pounds in an IPO in March and  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  raised about 1.3 billion pounds by selling
stakes in Direct Line Group Plc, Britain’s biggest home and
motor insurer. Companies in  Europe , the Middle East and Africa
have raised $6.7 billion in IPOs this year, 70 percent up on the
year-earlier period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Partnership  controls about 26 percent of the U.K.’s so-called enhanced annuity market, which sells guaranteed lifetime
incomes to pensioners with pre-existing medical conditions and
has grown by about 33 percent annually since 2006, Groves said.  The firm has an advantage over competitors because it has
the oldest proprietary data in market, stretching back to 1995,
after purchasing the information from Pension Annuity Friendly
Society in 2005, Groves said.  “With high-quality data you’re able to price more
accurately,” he said. “We use that data to give our customers,
who are people with a medical condition, better incomes than
they could get elsewhere.”  Operating profit rose 42 percent to 112 million pounds in
2012, the insurer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
