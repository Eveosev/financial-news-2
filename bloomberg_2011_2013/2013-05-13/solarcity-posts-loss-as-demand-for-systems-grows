  SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the second-largest
U.S. solar company by market value, posted a first-quarter loss
as it bore higher costs from installing rooftop solar systems at
little or no charge to customers.  The loss was $31 million, or 41 cents a share, compared
with income of $2.76 million, or 4 cents, a year earlier,  San
Mateo , California-based SolarCity said today in a statement.
That was 9 cents more than the average of six analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 21 percent to $30 million. This is the company’s
second earnings report since its December initial public
offering.  SolarCity invested $138.2 million to install solar systems,
up 65 percent, as demand for rooftop panels from homeowners and
businesses surged. The company is boosting spending now to build
projects that will deliver long-term revenue.  “Revenue is climbing but their cash outflows for financing
new systems was up significantly more,”  Pavel Molchanov , an
analyst at Raymond James & Associates in Houston, said in an
interview. He has the equivalent of a hold rating on the shares.
“The stock is outperforming the results.”  SolarCity installs power systems, often at no upfront cost
for customers, who sign decades-long contracts to purchase the
power. It said in January that installations will climb 60
percent to 250 megawatts this year, from 156 megawatts in 2012.  Wal-Mart Projects  The company installed 46 megawatts of panels in the
quarter, and a cumulative total of 333 megawatts. For the second
quarter, SolarCity expects to install 48 megawatts to 53
megawatts of solar systems, up from 46 megawatts in the first
quarter.  Customers include Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which said in March
that SolarCity had installed 4.7 megawatts of panels atop 12
stores in  Ohio .  SolarCity fell 6.6 percent to $33.50 at 4:55 p.m. after the
close in  New York . The shares, which jumped a record 24 percent
in regular trading today, have quadrupled since trading began.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  is the largest U.S. solar company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
