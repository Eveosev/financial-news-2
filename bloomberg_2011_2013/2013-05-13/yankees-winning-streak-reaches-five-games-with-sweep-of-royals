The New York Yankees pushed their
winning streak to five by completing a three-game sweep of the
Kansas City Royals with a 4-2 victory.  Robinson Cano and  Vernon Wells  hit back-to-back home runs
for the Yankees, while starting pitcher Hiroki Kuroda allowed
two runs over 7 2/3 innings yesterday in Kansas City.  The Yankees improved to 23-13, tied for the second-best
record in Major League Baseball entering today’s doubleheader
against the Cleveland Indians. They’re 22-9 since April 7, even
with starters such as  Derek Jeter , Mark Teixeira,  Alex Rodriguez 
and  Curtis Granderson  on the disabled list.  “These guys have gotten it done -- different ways,
different guys every night,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi said
at a news conference. “We’ve continued to lose players during
the season. These guys have done a great job.”  The Pittsburgh Pirates beat the New York Mets 3-2 on a run-scoring single by Pedro Alvarez in the eighth inning. The
winning run came against the New York bullpen after Mets pitcher
Matt Harvey allowed two runs over seven innings.  Chris Sale of the Chicago White Sox threw a one-hitter in a
3-0 win over the Los Angeles Angels. Sale had seven strikeouts,
no walks and took a perfect game into the seventh inning before
allowing a one-out single to Mike Trout.  The Toronto Blue Jays slugged five home runs in a 12-4 rout
of the Boston Red Sox, with  Jose Bautista  hitting two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
