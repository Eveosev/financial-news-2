South African corn fell after the
price on the Chicago Board of Trade, the global benchmark,
dropped 1.9 precent on May 10 as a  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  report found inventories will double as farms
recover from the 2012 drought.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
fell 1 percent to 2,121.20 rand ($232.57) a metric ton by the
midday close on the South African Futures Exchange. The yellow
variety for delivery in the same month dropped 1.1 percent to
2,103 rand a ton.  The U.S. harvest this year will surge 31 percent from 2012
to 14.14 billion bushels (359.2 million tons), the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said in a  report . Reserves on Aug. 31,
2014, will more than double from a year earlier to 2.004 billion
bushels, the USDA said.  “Prices in the U.S. came down after the USDA report on
Friday,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by
phone from  Pretoria  today. “They are estimating a record crop
and surplus stocks.”  Corn futures for July delivery slumped 1.9 percent to close
at $6.3625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade on May 10. The
U.S. is the world’s biggest producer of the grain.  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest producer of corn.
The white grain is a staple food in the country while the yellow
variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July fell 0.3 percent to 3,477 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
