West Texas Intermediate oil fell for
a third day as  China ’s  crude processing  reached the lowest level
in eight months in April and OPEC boosted output. Brent crude’s
premium to WTI narrowed to a 27-month low.  Prices dropped 0.9 percent as refining in China decreased
to 9.36 million barrels a day, according to  data  published today
on the website of the Beijing-based National Bureau of
Statistics. That’s the lowest level since August and 8 percent
below December’s record. Output in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries rose to a five-month high in April.  “High supplies and weak demand are never a bullish
signal,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “People were
hoping China would absorb some of the surplus. Now it looks like
the surplus is going to get bigger, especially since OPEC is
producing more.”  WTI for June delivery fell 87 cents to settle at $95.17 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices gained for a
third week in the five days ended May 10. The volume of all
contracts traded was 9.5 percent above the 100-day average.  Brent for June settlement lost $1.09, or 1 percent, to
close at $102.82 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .
Volume was 8.6 percent below the 100-day average. Brent’s
premium to WTI narrowed to $7.65, the lowest based on settlement
prices since Jan. 20, 2011.  Chinese Demand  China’s apparent oil demand, or domestic throughput plus
net imports, was 9.66 million barrels a day last month, also the
weakest since August, the statistics bureau data showed.  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) , or Sinopec, the nation’s biggest
refiner, will cut processing by 1.5 million metric tons this
quarter from an earlier plan because of higher fuel stockpiles,
ICIS C1 Energy, a Shanghai-based commodity researcher, said last
month.  “We have bearish news coming out of China,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “China’s refinery throughput dropped and
also OPEC production rose to a five-month high. The fundamental
picture is not supportive for oil.”  Demand fell as industrial output in the world’s second-biggest oil-consuming country rose 9.3 percent from a year
earlier last month, versus the 9.4 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. The U.S. is the world’s leading oil user.  China used 9.76 million barrels a day of oil in 2011,
according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  ‘Weaker Demand’  “People are worried about the build in global supplies and
weaker demand,” said Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist at
Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “The China data is bearish.”  OPEC produced 30.46 million barrels a day in April, up from
30.18 million in March, the group’s secretariat said May 10.
That’s the most since November. Saudi Arabia pumped 9.27 million
barrels a day in April, up from 9.13 million in March. That’s
the highest since November and compares with the country’s own
figure of 9.31 million barrels, based on its communication with
the 12-member group.  The Brent-WTI spread has narrowed almost 70 percent from
this year’s high of $23.44 on Feb. 8. Brent has dropped this
year after the restart of North Sea fields and as the debt
crisis in Europe limited economic growth. WTI has gained in 2013
as inventories fell at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
Nymex futures.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  predicted that the spread between WTI and
Brent will widen as U.S. supplies accumulate.  ‘Near Trough’  The gap between WTI and Brent is “near a trough and should
widen again, at least marginally, later this year” because of a
growing surplus of supply in Houston, Adam Longson, an analyst
at Morgan Stanley based in New York, said in a report today.  Oil reduced losses from an intraday decline to $94.47 as
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index erased its decline. The index
was little changed after falling as much as 0.4 percent.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
July was 21.3 percent at 2:37 p.m., up from 20.4 percent on May
10, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 544,880
contracts as of 3:05 p.m. It totaled 818,165 contracts in the
previous session, 40 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.77 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
