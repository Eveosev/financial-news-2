(Corrects spelling of Bills in second paragraph.)  Buffalo Bills General Manager Buddy
Nix stepped down after three National Football League seasons,
becoming a special assistant to the team.  Nix, 73, said he made the decision three weeks after the
 NFL draft  because he felt it was the “right time.” The Bills
didn’t say who would succeed him.  “By the ‘right time,’ I mean I think we have a good young
roster, an excellent head coach with a good staff, and it’s time
to let someone else handle these responsibilities and move
forward together,” Nix said in a statement on the team’s
 website .  The Bills went 6-10 in each of the last two seasons and 4-12 in 2010, giving the team a 16-32 record with Nix as GM. Nix
also was responsible for hiring coach Chan Gailey, who was fired
after last season.  Syracuse University ’s Doug Marrone was
brought in to be the team’s new coach in January.  Buffalo released starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick in
March, signing free agent  Kevin Kolb  and selecting passer E.J.
Manuel out of Florida State University with the 16th pick of
last month’s draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
