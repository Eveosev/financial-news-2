General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
and Chrysler Group LLC models won or tied in 12 of 21 segments
in a vehicle quality survey.  “There’s no questioning domestic carmakers want to lead,”
 Alexander Edwards , president of San Diego-based Strategic
Vision, which conducted the survey, said in a statement. “It’s
now forcing all manufacturers to build the most superior,
innovative and holistically quality vehicles possible to gain
the hearts and minds of customer.”  It was the first time in more than a decade that GM, Ford
and Chrysler models had a majority of category winners,
according to the statement. The three automakers all gained
market share in the first quarter for the first time in 20
years. The Michigan-based companies exceeded sales forecasts
last month and led the industry to its best April since 2007.  Ford’s Fusion sedan and GM’s Chevrolet Volt tied in the
medium-car segment. Ford’s F-250 and F-350 topped the list for
heavy-duty pickup. GM’s Buick Enclave, GMC Yukon and Chevrolet
Traverse, Avalanche and Corvette coupe led categories. Chrysler
Group’s Dodge Dart, 200 convertible sedan and Durango sport-utility vehicle also topped their categories. Chrysler is
majority owned by  Fiat SpA. (F)   Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  Lexus  topped
the brand rankings. The results were based on data from 17,568
buyers who purchased 2013 models from September to November
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
