Hedge funds and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on Brent crude for a second week to the
highest level in a month, data from ICE Futures Europe show.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 124,035 lots in
the week ended May 7, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitment of Traders report. The increase of 15,294
contracts, or 14 percent, leaves net bullish bets, or longs, at
their highest level since April 2.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 351,164, up by
28,751, or 8.9 percent. Net-shorts in this category are at the
highest since January 2011, the starting point for the data.  Brent crude  advanced 2.5 percent to $104.40 a barrel in the
week to May 7 on the ICE exchange, and traded for $102.66 a
barrel as of 12:20 p.m. London time today.  Swaps dealers  were net-long 265,251 lots, up 15,398 or 6.2
percent from a week earlier, in a 12th straight increase to
their highest level since the data began.  Money managers’ net-short bets on European  gasoil  futures
increased by 2,798 contracts, or 39 percent, to 9,933. This was
the second week in which there were more shorts than longs since
the data was first published in January 2011.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as  hedge funds  and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves.  Analysts and investors follow changes in speculators’
positions because such transactions can reflect an expectation
of a change in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
