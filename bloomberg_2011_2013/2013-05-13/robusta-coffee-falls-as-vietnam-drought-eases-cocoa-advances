Robusta coffee fell in  London  as
rainfall in growing regions of  Vietnam , the world’s largest
producer of the robusta variety, eased concerns a drought
earlier this year would cut output. Cocoa advanced.  Most areas in Dak Lak province, representing about 30
percent of Vietnam’s coffee crop, will get 60 millimeters (2.4
inches) to 90 millimeters of rain in the 10 days through May 20,
the Meteorology and Hydrology Department said in a report e-mailed today. Recent rains in the coffee belt completely erased
the threat of drought, Nguyen Chi Cuong, chief executive officer
at trading company NC Group Ltd., which has offices in  Ho Chi
Minh City , said in an e-mail on May 3.  “The drought appears to have ended in Vietnam, which
should help bring more of the current crop to the market, as
well as up expectations for next year’s production,” Sterling
Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said
in a report e-mailed on May 10. “While the chart of arabica
looks bad, robusta looks worse.”  Robusta coffee futures for delivery in July slid 0.4
percent to $2,022 a metric ton by 10:48 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
London. Arabica coffee futures for the same delivery month fell
0.6 percent to $1.436 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Vietnam’s harvest may climb to 1.5 million tons in the year
starting in October from the prior period’s 1.43 million tons,
the median of 10 trader and shipper estimates compiled by
Bloomberg showed. That would be the most since a record 1.65
million tons in the 2011-12 season.  Sugar, Cocoa  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August was little
changed at $489.10 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for delivery
in July rose 0.6 percent to 17.53 cents a pound on ICE.  The  premium  white sugar commanded over raw slid 12 percent
this month to $102.70 a ton, data on Bloomberg showed.  “The reason for the fall is both lower demand -- the
Ramadan rush is coming to an end -- and higher supply, notably
people coming to terms with the prospect of  Mexico  as a
substantial exporter,” Paul Bannister, head of sugar brokerage
at Marex Spectron Group, said in a report e-mailed today.  Cocoa for delivery in July rose 0.3 percent to 1,532 pounds
($2,352) a ton in London. Cocoa for the same delivery month
added 0.1 percent to $2,303 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
