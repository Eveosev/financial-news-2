China ’s yuan declined for a second
day as the central bank cut its daily fixing, forcing the
currency to weaken to stay within the permitted trading range.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  0.09
percent lower today at 6.2072 per dollar, 1.06 percent weaker
than the spot rate’s close last week. The spot rate is allowed
to diverge from the fixing by a maximum 1 percent. The  Dollar
Index (DXY)  was headed for the biggest three-day gain since July as
Group of Seven finance chiefs indicated they will tolerate the
yen’s decline. China is testing the yuan’s exchange equilibrium
and may soon double its trading band,  Shanghai  Securities News
reported today, citing people it didn’t identify.  “The weaker fixing is in line with the dollar’s rally
against Asian currencies after the G-7 meetings,” said Daniel Chan, a Hong Kong-based executive vice president at Glory Sky
Global Markets Ltd. “There’s still speculation on  yuan  band
widening, and I think it’s only a matter of time before it
happens.”  The yuan dropped 0.08 percent to close at 6.1468 per dollar
in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency reached the upper limit of the band earlier
today at 6.1455. It touched 6.1307 on May 9, the strongest level
since the government unified official and market exchange rates
at the end of 1993.  FDI Rules  Fixed-asset investment growth in the world’s second-largest
economy unexpectedly decelerated last month while industrial
output trailed estimates, official data showed today.  China will abolish 24 regulations on foreign-exchange
regulations for foreign direct investment, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said on May 11. The nation’s
new local-currency loans exceeded estimates last month while
money supply expanded at a faster pace, official data showed.  In Hong Kong, the yuan climbed 0.09 percent to 6.1457 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month
non-deliverable forwards gained 0.03 percent to 6.2270, a 1.3
percent discount to the onshore exchange rate.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
advanced five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.94
percent. That’s the highest level since Dec. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
