A Russian gay man was killed on May
10 in the southern city of Volgograd by his drinking companions
after he revealed his sexual orientation, RIA Novosti reported.  The 23-year-old man’s naked body was found in the courtyard
of an apartment building, with injuries to his genitalia, the
state news service cited Andrei Gapchenko, a senior official at
the regional investigative committee, as saying. A 22-year-old
classmate of the victim and a 27-year-old acquaintance with a
criminal record were arrested and are being questioned,
according to RIA.  Russian lawmakers in January gave preliminary approval to a
bill banning “homosexual propaganda” among minors, a measure
denounced by gay rights campaigners. Homosexuality was illegal
in the  Soviet Union  and decriminalized in  Russia  in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
