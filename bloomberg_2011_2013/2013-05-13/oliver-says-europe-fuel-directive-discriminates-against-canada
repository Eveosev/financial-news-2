Europe’s proposed fuel directive
discriminates against oil produced in  Canada ’s oil sands and
isn’t based on science, Canadian Natural Resources Minister Joe
Oliver said.  Speaking to reporters in Toronto, Oliver said the policy,
which rates various types of oil by their impact on the
environment, doesn’t recognize that emissions from Venezuelan
oil are the same or higher than Canadian oil-sands crude.  Canada is working with EU politicians on the issue, Oliver
said. Taking the dispute to the  World Trade Organization  would
be a last resort, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
