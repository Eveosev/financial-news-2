Consolidated Water Co. (CWCO) , a seawater
desalination plant operator and developer in the Caribbean,
reported a 60 percent increase in first-quarter profit, helped
by a settlement over water delivered to the British Virgin
Island government.  Net income rose to $3.7 million from $2.3 million a year
earlier, buoyed by $1.08 million in earnings and profit-sharing
from Consolidated Waterâ€™s equity investment in its OC-BVI
affiliate for water supplied by the Baughers Bay plant on
Tortola, the Georgetown, Cayman Islands-based water company said
in a May 10 statement. Revenue for the quarter slipped 1 percent
to $16.6 million from a year earlier.  Consolidated Water shares have climbed 47 percent the past
year. It operates water production and distribution facilities
in the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Bahamas and
Belize.  To contact the reporter on this story:
