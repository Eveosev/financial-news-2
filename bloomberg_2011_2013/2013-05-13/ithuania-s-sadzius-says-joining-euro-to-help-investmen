Lithuanian Finance Minister Rimantas Sadzius said joining the euro will help his country’s economy by
boosting its ability to attract international financing.  “We would have a huge improvement of the investment
climate in  Lithuania  almost overnight,” Sadzius said in an
interview in Brussels today. He said Lithuania risks isolation
if it slows its march to the common currency, now that Finland
and  Estonia  have joined the 17-nation bloc and  Latvia  is on pace
to join in 2014.  Lithuania is aiming to join the euro zone in 2015, assuming
it can meet all of the economic and fiscal targets. The Baltic
nation also will take up the 27-nation European Union’s six-month rotating presidency in the second half of this year,
placing it in charge of administrative matters for EU lawmaking.  Sadzius said the Lithuanian presidency will be a stepping
stone as his country strives to become a “full-fledged member
of the European family” by joining the euro.  “We want to participate in the decision-making of the euro
zone,” Sadzius said. “We see our future here.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
