Portugal ’s  consumer price index  rose
in April from a year earlier at a slower pace than recorded in
March.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
climbed 0.4 percent from a year earlier, less than the 0.7
percent increase in March, the Lisbon-based National Statistics
Institute said today in an e-mailed statement. Prices rose 0.1
percent from March.  Using the statistics institute’s own methods, consumer
prices in Portugal rose 0.2 percent in April from a year earlier
and were unchanged from March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
