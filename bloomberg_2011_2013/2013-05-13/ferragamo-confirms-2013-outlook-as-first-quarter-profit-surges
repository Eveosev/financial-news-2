Salvatore Ferragamo SpA (SFER) , an Italian
maker of  $1,390 sandals , reported first-quarter profit that
exceeded estimates and confirmed its projection for earnings
growth this year amid surging sales in the Americas.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 26 percent to 48 million euros ($62.3
million), the Florence, Italy-based company said today in a
statement after the stock market closed. Analysts predicted 42.9
million euros, according to the average of nine estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales advanced 8.6 percent to 281.9
million euros, or 9.6 percent excluding currency shifts.  Business patterns this year justify expectations for
revenue and profit growth through 2013, Ferragamo said,
repeating a March forecast. Luxury competitors including  LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  and  PPR (PP)  SA-owned Gucci last month
reported the weakest quarterly sales growth in more than three
years as demand softened in Europe and Asia.  Ferragamo shares retreated 0.9 percent to 23.11 euros in
Milan, giving the shoemaker a market value of 3.9 billion euros.  Analysts estimated sales of 282.4 million euros, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
