U.S. President  Barack Obama  said
Britain would lose global influence if it left the European
Union, providing a boost for Prime Minister David Cameron as he
battles members of his own party who want to quit the bloc.  “The U.K.’s participation in the EU is an expression of
its influence and its role in the world,” Obama told a joint
news conference at the White House after talks with Cameron
today. Cameron’s strategy of attempting to renegotiate the terms
of membership before a referendum in 2017 “makes some
sense to me,” he said. “You probably want to see if you can
fix what is broken in a very important relationship before you
break it off.”  Cameron’s three-day visit to the U.S. that began today has
been overshadowed by wrangling at home over Britain’s
relationship with the 27-nation EU. Earlier, he rebuked Tory
lawmakers have already decided that Britain should withdraw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
