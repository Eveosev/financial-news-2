The  Euro Stoxx 50 Index (SX5E)  may gain
almost 8 percent by September after a decline this month,
according to a technical analyst at Aurel BGC in Paris.  The benchmark index for euro-area equities may rally to
3,000, near its 2011 high, after falling 1 percent to 2 percent
in May, Gerard Sagnier said in a phone interview today. The
gauge will reach an initial resistance at 2,880 in the next two
months, a level signaled by linking the highs of September 2012
and January 2013, he forecast.  The Euro Stoxx 50 gained 8.2 percent over the past three
weeks, closing at a 22-month high of 2,785.24 on May 10. That
extended this year’s advance to 5.7 percent amid speculation
that central banks around the world will continue to add
stimulus to support economic growth.  “I’m optimistic for the coming four to six months,”
Sagnier said. “The market has reached new highs and that’s
extremely positive.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
