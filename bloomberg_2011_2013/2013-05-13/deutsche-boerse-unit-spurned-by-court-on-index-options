A  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  unit lost a U.S.
Supreme Court appeal that sought the right to offer options
based on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.  The justices today turned away an appeal by Deutsche
Boerse’s International Securities Exchange LLC of a court order
that barred the company from creating a market for the options
without a license. Deutsche Boerse is the operator of the
Frankfurt stock exchange.  The rebuff is a victory for  McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) , whose S&P Dow
Jones unit maintains the indexes, and  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , whose
Chicago Board Options Exchange offers index options under an
exclusive licensing agreement with S&P Dow Jones.  McGraw Hill and CBOE won an Illinois state court ruling
barring International Securities Exchange from using the indexes
to create an index-options market without a license.  At the Supreme Court, International Securities Exchange
argued unsuccessfully that federal copyright law barred the
claim by McGraw Hill and CBOE.  The case is International Securities Exchange v. Chicago
Board of Options Exchange, 12-940.  To contact the reporter on this story:
