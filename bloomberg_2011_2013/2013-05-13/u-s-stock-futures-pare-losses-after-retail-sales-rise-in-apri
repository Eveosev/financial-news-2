U.S. stock futures pared losses after
government data showed retail sales unexpectedly rose in April.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring in June lost
0.1 percent to 1,627.40 at 8:35 a.m. in  New York  after falling
as much as 0.5 percent earlier. The equities gauge rallied to a
record on May 10, capping a third week of gains and extending
its advance so far this year to 15 percent.  U.S. retail sales climbed 0.1 percent last month following
a 0.5 percent drop in March, Commerce Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg called for a 0.3 percent drop. The figures used to
calculate growth, which exclude categories such as automobiles,
also advanced.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
