deflation,” said Kuninobu Takeuchi, Tokyo-based executive
portfolio manager at DIAM Co, which oversees the equivalent of
about $98 billion. “Exiting deflation means growth, enabling
companies to expand. Companies tend to put forward conservative
profit forecasts, say a 30-40 percent increase, while the market
is pricing growth of 40-50 percent.”  The Topix and the Nikkei have been the top-performing major
equity gauges since mid-November, advancing more than 70
percent amid unprecedented monetary easing from the  Bank of
Japan  and calls from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to end deflation.  Brokerages Rally  The Topix Securities Index jumped 7.6 percent on optimism

signaled acceptance of the yen’s decline through 100 per dollar,
while saying they will monitor the effect of Japan’s  policies
on currencies. The yen has fallen 15 percent against the dollar
