NPB Neue Privat Bank AG , a Zurich-based private bank and asset manager, said it’s part of a group
of Swiss wealth managers cooperating with a U.S. probe into
alleged offshore tax evasion by Americans.  “As with many other Swiss banks with U.S. clients, Neue
Privat Bank has been contacted by the Department of Justice,”
Andreas Hildenbrand, a spokesman for the firm, said by phone
today. “The bank is cooperating with the Department of Justice
in line with Swiss law” and is consulting with Switzerland’s
financial services regulator, Finma, on the matter, he said.  Switzerland has been in talks with the U.S. for almost two
years in a bid to settle a Justice Department investigation of
at least 14 financial firms, including Credit Suisse Group AG
and Julius Baer Group Ltd., for allegedly helping Americans hide
money from the Internal Revenue Service. Wegelin & Co. closed
its doors after the oldest Swiss bank pleaded guilty in
Manhattan federal court in January to conspiring to help conceal
more than $1.2 billion in assets from the IRS.  Neue Privat Bank, which managed 1.3 billion Swiss francs
($1.36 billion) for private and institutional customers as of
Jan. 3, 2012, hasn’t been indicted, Hildenbrand said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
