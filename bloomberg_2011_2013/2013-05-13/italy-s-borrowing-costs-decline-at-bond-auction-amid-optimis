Italy ’s borrowing costs declined at a
bond auction today as investors continued to look for higher
returns amid expectations of further monetary easing.  Italy sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.54 billion) of 2.25
percent 2016 bonds at 1.92 percent compared with 2.29 percent at
the last auction April 11 and the lowest since a sale of
comparable bonds on Jan. 11. Investors bid 1.34 times the amount
of the three-year bond offered, down from 1.40 times last month.  “Demand was relatively good, supported by still good
liquidity conditions that encourage carry trades on the Italian
debt,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group
in  London , said in an e-mail after the sale.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said last week
policy makers are ready to cut interest rates again if needed
after reducing them to a record low May 2. Finance Minister
Fabrizio Saccomanni has said the government won’t need
additional budget cuts and remains committed to holding the
Italian deficit to less than 3 percent of gross domestic
product.  The Rome-based Treasury also sold longer-term debt, placing
1.5 billion euros of 4.5% 2026 bonds and 3 billion euros of a
new floating-rate 2018 bond to yield respectively 4.07 percent
and 2.44 percent. Altogether, Italy sold 8 billion euros of
debt, the maximum target for the auction.  Italy’s  10-year bond yield  rose 6.3 basis points to 3.956
percent after the sale at 3:04 p.m. in Rome, pushing the
difference with comparable German bunds to 259.7 basis points.
Benchmark 10-year yields in Italy,  Europe ’s biggest bond market,
on May 3 dropped to the lowest level since February 2006.  Record-low Yields  “If you weight the country’s fundamentals against the
current yields at historical low levels, it’s difficult to think
that there will be more room for further tightening of the
spread,” said Gianluca Ziglio, executive director of fixed-income research at Sunrise Brokers LLP in London.  Today’s auction comes as members of Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s government meet in Tuscany at an informal retreat to set
the direction of new leadership. After two months of political
impasse, Italy may pass this week measures to suspend the June
payment of the tax on primary residences and finance jobless
benefits as unemployment remains near a 20-year high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
