Prime Minister David Cameron has
asked his newly formed policy unit to look at whether gasoline
retailers could be forced to display the prices of motorway
service stations more prominently, the premier’s office said.  The government is trying to address the rising cost of
living.  Consumer prices  have risen 10 percent since the 2010
general election, three times the increase in wages, according
to ONS data.  While the Office of Fair Trading concluded in a Jan. 30
report that the market for gasoline in the U.K. was competitive,
with rising prices the result of higher oil prices and taxes, it
said drivers have little choice on motorways and don’t know the
price until they have stopped.  One option under consideration is making retailers display
their own prices and those of the next two service stations on
the road.  To contact the reporter on this story:
