Growth i n  Estonia  will slow this year
and could be further hampered if the euro-area economy takes
longer than expected to recover, according to the  International
Monetary Fund’s  staff.  Risks to Estonia’s economic expansion, which the IMF sees
slowing to about 3 percent this year after a 3.2 percent gain
last year, are on the downside and stem from prolonged slow
growth in the 17-country euro area, the IMF staff wrote in its
annual assessment of Estonia’s economy. The IMF sees Estonia
growing 3.2 percent in 2014.  “With little evidence of a turnaround in the euro area,
the projected pickup in external demand remains to be
confirmed,” according to the staff report, which was dated
April 17 and released today. “Delays in the euro-area recovery
can slow Estonia’s exports -- two-thirds of which are to the
European Union -- reduce  job creation  and thereby limit
household’s ability to service their loans.”  Estonia, the most recent euro member, has weathered
 Europe ’s debt crisis as Swedish and Finnish demand helped its
economy recover from a 20 percent contraction in the wake of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 demise.  Estonia had a preliminary budget deficit of 0.3 percent of
gross domestic product last year after running surpluses in
2010-2011.  The country’s “fiscal position is strong, but strenuous
efforts will be needed to resist calls on the public purse and
avoid untimely fiscal stimulus in 2013,” according to the IMF
staff, which also estimated that the real  exchange rate  “has
remained broadly in line with fundamentals.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
