Gasoline gained on speculation that
unplanned refinery shutdowns and slowdowns will crimp supply as
the nation nears the Sept. 2 Labor Day holiday.  Futures rose 0.7 percent. Motiva Enterprises LLC was forced
to shut or slow crude units and other equipment at the 255,000-barrel-a-day Convent,  Louisiana , plant and the 600,000-barrel-a-day  Port Arthur , Texas, site, which is the larges in the U.S.
Inventories fell 4.03 million barrels last week, according to
the Energy Information Administration.  “Gasoline remains supported by higher-than-expected
inventory draws and the numerous refinery problems at Motiva
Port Arthur and Convent, which will impact gasoline supplies as
we go into the Labor Day weekend,” said  Andy Lipow , president
of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 2.12 cents to $2.9589
a gallon at 10:26 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on
trading volume that was 25 percent below the 100-day average.  Motiva Port Arthur is operating at less than half capacity
after the shutdown of a fire-damaged hydrocracker forced the
idling of the plant’s biggest crude unit. The 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit will be out of production until the refinery
finds a buyer for its output of vacuum gasoil, which feeds the
hydrocracker that may be down two to six weeks, a person
familiar with operations said yesterday.  Convent Outage  Motiva’s refinery in Convent may have to keep a crude unit
shut for a month after an Aug. 19 fire, a person familiar with
operations said.  The motor fuel’s crack  spread  versus West  Texas 
Intermediate crude increased 3 cents to $14.55 a barrel. The
fuel’s  premium  over Brent rose 42 cents to $8.98.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.1 cent to $3.534 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Prices are 18.2 cents below a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery gained 0.6
cent to $3.0828 a gallon on trading volume that was 10 percent
below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI fell 41 cents to $25.16 a
barrel. The  premium over Brent  widened 5 cents to $19.66 a
barrel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
