Jason Heyward’s jaw was fractured in
two places when the Atlanta Braves right fielder was hit by a
fastball thrown by Jon Niese of the  New York Mets  last night.  Heyward, 24, was struck by the 90 mile-per-hour (145 kph)
pitch in the sixth inning of Atlanta’s 4-1 win at Citi Field in
 New York .  Heyward will undergo surgery today in Atlanta. The Braves
won’t know his recovery prognosis until after the operation.  “He never lost consciousness,” Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. “He was talking the whole time when he got hit
with the ball. Before they took him to the hospital, he popped
his head into the dugout and said ’bye’ to some of the guys.”  Heyward has batted .345 with a .408 on-base percentage and
a .586 slugging percentage since moving into the leadoff role
for Atlanta on July 28.  “It didn’t really slip out of my hands, but it kind of
just ran in on him,” Niese said. “Obviously no intent, but I
just felt bad. It’s every pitcher and every hitter’s worst
nightmare. I just hope he’s OK.”  Heyward missed almost a month of the Major League Baseball
season after undergoing an emergency appendectomy in Denver on
April 22. He returned to the team May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
