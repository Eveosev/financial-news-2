Global sugar supplies will exceed
demand for a fourth consecutive year in the season that starts
Oct. 1, possibly sending prices even lower, the International
Sugar Organization said.  Sugar production will exceed demand by 4.5 million metric
tons in 2013-14, the London-based organization said in a report
e-mailed today. It forecast a surplus of 3.5 million tons last
month. Raw sugar prices have dropped 16 percent this year with
the surplus for 2012-13 at a record 10.3 million tons, ISO said.  “It seems that a lower global surplus per se cannot be
treated as a price supportive factor and the market may record
more losses during the 2013/14 season,” ISO said.
“Fundamentals are likely to remain in surplus for at least one
more year.”  Raw sugar for October delivery dropped 0.1 percent to 16.3
cents a pound by 10:42 a.m. in  New York  on ICE Futures U.S.  Global production will fall 1.2 percent to 180.8 million
tons, the first drop since 2008-09, while demand expands 2.1
percent to 176.3 million tons, ISO said. The amount of sugar
available for exports will rise to a record 57.5 million tons
while import demand will fall for a third consecutive year.  Global stockpiles will rise 0.5 percent to 74.4 million
tons at the end of 2013-14 and reserves as a percentage of
consumption will fall to 42.2 percent from 42.9 percent,
according to ISO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
