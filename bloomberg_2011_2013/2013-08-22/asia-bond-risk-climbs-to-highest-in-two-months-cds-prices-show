The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
climbed, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 6 basis points to 166 basis points
as of 8:41 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for its highest close
since June 24, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 4.5 basis
points to 128.5 as of 10:44 a.m. in Sydney, according to ANZ
prices. The measure last closed above that level on July 12,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1 basis point to
101 as of 9:41 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. Thatâ€™s the highest since July 29, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
