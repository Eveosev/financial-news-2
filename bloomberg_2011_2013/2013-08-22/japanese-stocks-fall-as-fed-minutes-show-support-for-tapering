Japan’s  Topix index  erased earlier
losses as investors weighed an unexpected increase in China’s
manufacturing against Federal Reserve minutes showing broad
support for paring unprecedented stimulus.  Daikin Industries Ltd. (6367) , an air-conditioner maker that gets
18 percent of revenue in China, rose 0.2 percent after falling
as much as 1.7 percent. Mazda Motor Corp., an automaker that
gets 30 percent of its sales in  North America , pared its loss to
2.5 percent.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co., owner of the crippled
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, fell 4.5 percent,
extending yesterday’s 9.3 percent drop, as it said it needs
overseas expertise to help contain radioactive water leaks.  The  Topix (TPX)  was little changed at 1,122.24 at the trading
break in Tokyo after falling as much as 0.9 percent. The Nikkei
225 Stock Average lost 0.3 percent to 13,380.28. The preliminary
reading of 50.1 for a China Purchasing Managers’ Index released
today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics compares with a
final figure of 47.7 in July, and was higher than all 16
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  “China’s manufacturing data definitely changed the
market’s direction,” said Kenji Shiomura, a Tokyo-based senior
strategist at Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Japan’s second
largest brokerage. “The data is easing a risk-off sentiment,
which has been persistent recently. The focus has been on
capital outflows out of Asia and slower growth in  emerging
markets  due to the Fed’s tapering.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
