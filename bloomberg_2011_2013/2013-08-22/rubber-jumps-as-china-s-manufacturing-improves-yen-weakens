Rubber rallied as data showed
 China ’s manufacturing expanded, boosting prospects for demand
from the world’s largest user, and a weaker Japanese currency
raised the appeal of the yen-denominated futures.  Rubber for delivery in January on Tokyo Commodity Exchange
gained as much as 2.8 percent to 267.8 yen a kilogram ($2,724 a
metric ton) and traded at 266.2 yen at 11:18 a.m. The rally
pared losses for futures this year to 12 percent.  A private gauge of Chinese factory output rose to 50.1 for
August from an 11-month low, adding to signs the world’s second-biggest economy is stabilizing. The yen slid to 98.34 per
dollar, the weakest since Aug. 15, after Federal Reserve minutes
stoked speculation stimulus will be cut next month.  “The Chinese data eased concerns rubber demand may
weaken,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in
Tokyo. “Futures also got a boost from the  currency market .”  Fed officials were “comfortable” with Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke ’s plans to start reducing bond buying later this year
should the economy improve, and a few said tapering may be
needed soon, minutes of their July meeting showed.  The preliminary reading of 50.1 for a Purchasing Managers’
Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compares with a final figure of 47.7 in July and the 48.2 median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 16 economists. A number
above 50 indicates an expansion.  Rubber for delivery in January added 1.7 percent to 19,875
 yuan  ($3,245) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board dropped 0.4 percent to 80.95 baht ($2.52) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
