Thailand’s baht fell to the weakest
level since August 2010 after Federal Reserve minutes showed
officials support a cut in stimulus this year if the  U.S.
economy  improves.  The baht slipped beyond 32 per dollar for the first time
since July 2012 as official data showed global funds sold $582
million more Thai bonds than they bought this month through
yesterday and  pulled  a net 30.6 billion baht ($954 million) from
equities. A government report this week showed Southeast Asia’s
second-largest economy entered a recession for the first time
since 2009.  “There’s concern of fund outflows from  emerging markets 
due to the Fed’s tapering, which is weighing on regional
currencies,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief currency strategist at
Daiwa Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “Growth in emerging countries
has been slowing, hurting sentiment further.”  The baht dropped 0.8 percent to 32.09 per dollar as of 7:48
a.m. in Bangkok and touched a three-year low of 32.13 earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, climbed six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 7.2 percent.  Fed officials were “broadly comfortable” with Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke ’s plans to start reducing bond buying later this
year should the economy improve, with a few saying tapering may
be needed soon, minutes of their July meeting showed.  Thailand’s gross domestic product unexpectedly decreased
0.3 percent in the three months through June from the previous
quarter, when it contracted a revised 1.7 percent, the National
Economic & Social Development Board said Aug. 19. The agency cut
its 2013 expansion forecast to 3.8 percent to 4.3 percent from
4.2 percent to 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
