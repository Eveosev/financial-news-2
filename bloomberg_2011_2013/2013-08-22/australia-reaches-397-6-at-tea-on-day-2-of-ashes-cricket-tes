Australia cemented its advantage on
day two of the final Ashes cricket Test against England, with
 Steve Smith ’s century pushing the visitors to 397-6 at tea after
a rain-delayed start at the Oval in London.  The 24-year-old was not out on 112 at the break, combining
with Brad Haddin for a 65-run partnership before Haddin was
bowled by Jonathan Trott. Play was delayed until after lunch by
persistent rain, and heavy cloud cover presented England’s
attack with the perfect conditions for swing bowling.  James Anderson  bowled Peter Siddle for 23 in the fifth over
of the day, but England couldn’t maintain any momentum. Smith
reached his 100 with a six over the long-on boundary off Trott.  Australia ended the session firmly in control with Smith on
112 and James Faulkner, making his debut, unbeaten on one.  England leads the five-match series 3-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
