OAO Rostelecom,  Russia ’s state-run
telecommunications operator, reported second-quarter earnings
that beat analysts estimates as lower  capital spending  reduced
financial costs.  Net income fell 3 percent to 7.28 billion rubles ($219
million), the company said today in a statement. This beat the
average estimate of 6.49 billion rubles from four analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 1 percent to 77 billion rubles.
Rostelecom cut spending by two thirds to 7 billion rubles while
net debt fell 7 percent to 182 billion rubles.  “Profit came higher than expected as the company slowed
down capital spending and thereby cut financial costs,”
Alexander Vengranovich, an analyst at Otkritie Capital in
Moscow, said by phone. “What matters more is how Rostelecom
will expand in mobile.”  Rostelecom, Russia’s dominant fixed-line operator with
160,000 employees, is losing users as customers abandon its
service in favor of mobile phones. The company is spending more
than $2.5 billion a year to expand into growing businesses
including wireless service, pay-TV and fixed-line broadband.  The number of Rostelecom’s fixed-line users declined 5
percent from a year earlier to 26.4 million as of June 30, while
mobile subscribers added 2 percent to 13.8 million. Fixed
broadband users and pay-TV users both rose 11 percent to 9.6
million and 6.9 million respectively.  Second-quarter operating income before depreciation and
amortization fell 6 percent to 28.8 billion rubles. The Oibda
margin fell to 37.4 percent from 39.9 percent a year earlier as
fixed-line users dropped the service and competition intensified
in the country’s wireless market.  Full-year Oibda margin should range from 36 percent to 39
percent while revenue will probably show “slight” growth, the
Moscow-based company said in a  presentation  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
