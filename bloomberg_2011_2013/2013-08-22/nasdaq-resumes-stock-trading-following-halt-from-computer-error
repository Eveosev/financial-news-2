Stocks listed on the Nasdaq Stock
Market resumed trading after a computer breakdown shook American
equity markets.  Trading in Nasdaq securities resumed at around 3:25 p.m. in
 New York , the exchange said in a statement on its website.
Nasdaq said earlier that trading in shares it lists had been
stopped amid issues at its Securities Information
Processor, the feed that disseminates quotes and prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
