Rupiah forwards fell to a four-year
low as the  Federal Reserve  signaled it may start reducing the
stimulus that has driven investment to emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index (ADXY)  reached a one-year
low today after Fed officials said they are “comfortable” with
the plan to start tapering its $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases later this year, according to the minutes of the
central bank’s July meeting released yesterday. Indonesia will
draft policy within two days to address the nation’s economic
issues, with the rupiah the main focus, President  Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono  said yesterday.  “The forwards are pricing in the possibility of Fed
tapering in September,” said Rully Nova, a currency analyst at
PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta. “The government
should allow the rupiah to weaken to adjust imports, which will
subsequently help the currency.”  Rupiah one-month non-deliverable forwards fell 2.3 percent
to 11,425 per dollar as of 9:52 a.m. in Jakarta, the weakest
level since April 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
contracts traded at a 5.6 percent discount to the spot rate,
which declined 0.1 percent to 10,788, prices from local banks
show. The currency reached 10,818 yesterday, the lowest level
since April 2009.  A  fixing  by the Association of Banks in  Singapore  used to
settle the derivative contracts was set at 10,902 yesterday, the
weakest since April 2009. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, rose 1.71 percentage points to 19.73 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on  government bonds  due May 2023 was unchanged at
8.46 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show. It reached 8.54 percent yesterday, the highest since March
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
