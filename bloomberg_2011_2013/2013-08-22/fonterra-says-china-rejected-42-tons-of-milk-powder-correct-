(Corrects chemical compound in first paragraph in Aug. 21
story.)  New Zealand ’s Fonterra Cooperative
Group Ltd., the world’s largest dairy exporter, said China
rejected 42 metric tons of its milk powder in May because of
elevated nitrite levels.  While the product was tested in New Zealand and met New
Zealand standards, after shipment to China it was tested again
and didn’t meet Chinese specifications, Fonterra said in an e-mailed statement today. Fonterra chose to accept the Chinese
laboratory results and advised regulators in both China and New
Zealand of the non-compliant product, which remained within
Fonterra’s control and never entered the market, it said.  New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully is in China
trying to soothe tensions with the country’s biggest dairy
customer.  China  said this week it found elevated nitrate levels
in a milk protein made by New Zealand’s Westland Milk Products.  Earlier this month, Fonterra said a whey protein exported
to China and used in goods such as baby formula may have been
contaminated by a botulism-causing bacteria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
