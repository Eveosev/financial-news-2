Hong Kong   stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index posting its first gain in six days, as commodity
shares climbed after manufacturing data from  China  to Germany
added to signs of global recovery.  China Coal Energy Co. (1898) , the nation’s second-largest producer
of the fuel, jumped 4.7 percent after preliminary data showed
unexpected expansion in China’s factory activity. Jiangxi Copper
Co., the country’s largest supplier of the metal, rose 1.5
percent.  Hong Kong & China Gas Co. (3) , which pipes gas to
households and industry in the city and the mainland, dropped
2.9 percent after posting lower profit.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  added 0.4 percent to 21,895.40 at the
close, erasing losses of as much as 1.3 percent. The equity
benchmark dropped 3.2 percent in the past five days as emerging-market outflows accelerated on signs the U.S. will start
reducing bond buying next month.  “Improving economic data is providing a little bit of a
boost, particularly for commodity stocks,” said Marco Li, Hong
Kong-based money manager at Manulife Asset Management, which
oversees about $238 billion. “The period of August and
September is always very jittery for the market. With the
prospect of Fed tapering, capital flows are going to be more
scarce so investors will have to be selective.”  Fed officials were “comfortable” with Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke ’s plan to start reducing bond buying this year should
the economy improve, minutes of their July meeting showed.
Global stocks have been whipsawed since May, when Bernanke
indicated policy makers could begin tapering should the job
market continue to strengthen.  China Manufacturing  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the  H-share index , climbed 1.1 percent to 9,967.77 today after falling
as much as 1.5 percent. The gauge dropped 18 percent from a Feb.
1 high through today as China’s growth slowed. The index traded
at 1.2 times book value, compared with a five-year average of
1.8.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics’ flash purchasing
managers’ index of preliminary China manufacturing data
unexpectedly rose to 50.1 for August, from 47.7 in July. That
compares with a 48.2 median estimate by 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Mainland factory activity has showed signs of expansion
after Premier  Li Keqiang  rolled out measures to support growth,
including tax breaks for small businesses and an increase in
railway investment. China will reach the government’s 7.5
percent growth target this year and maintain that pace in 2014,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Germany’s preliminary manufacturing PMI increased to 52
this month from 50.7 in July, Markit Economics said today,
beating the 51.1 estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Worst Performer  The  Hang Seng Index  retreated 3.4 percent this year, the
worst performer among developed markets tracked by Bloomberg.
The gauge traded at 10.5 times estimated earnings today,
compared with 14.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
yesterday.  “We’re going to see further weakness in the market,” said
 Andrew Sullivan , director of sales trading at Maybank Kim Eng
Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong. “There are lots of things weighing
on the market apart from the Fed tapering. The fact that the PMI
came in over 50 should have been encouraging but there will
still be concerns on Chinese data until we see a continuing
increasing trend.”  Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.4 percent today. The gauge
lost 0.6 percent yesterday after the release of the Fed minutes
pointed to a likely reduction in stimulus. Officials will begin
to curtail bond buying next month, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. Global central
bankers are meeting this week in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , to
discuss the global economy and monetary policy.  Resources Rally  Raw material producers posted the biggest advance among the
11 industry groups on the Hang Seng Composite Index, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Coal jumped 4.7 percent to HK$4.90.  China Shenhua
Energy Co. (1088) , the nation’s biggest producer of the fuel, gained
2.3 percent to HK$24.15. Jiangxi Copper rose 1.5 percent to
HK$15.24.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to retailers
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., climbed 2.9 percent to HK$12.
The company said it will start distributing Kent & Curwin men’s
apparel in the U.S.  ZTE Corp. (763) , China’s second-largest maker of equipment for
phone networks, gained 1.4 percent to HK$1 after reporting
first-half net income increased 27 percent from a year earlier
to 310 million  yuan  ($51 million).  Hong Kong & China Gas dropped 2.9 percent to HK$18.60.
First-half net profit fell to HK$3.6 billion from HK$4.1 billion
($528.7 million) a year earlier, the company said yesterday.  The HSI Volatility Index dropped 2.5 percent to 18.82,
retreating from a one-month high, indicating traders expect the
equity benchmark to swing 5.4 percent in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
