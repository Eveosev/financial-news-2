Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) ’s
new regional jet, Japan’s first such aircraft, won fresh support
from U.S. commuter carriers  SkyWest Inc. (SKYW)  and Trans States
Holdings even as its debut was delayed by more than a year.  SkyWest and Trans States said yesterday they are in talks
about a new timetable with Mitsubishi’s aviation unit,
Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp., after the Nagoya, Japan-based
planemaker pushed back deliveries of the 78- and 92-seat models
until 2017’s second quarter from March 2016.  The postponement adds to Mitsubishi’s struggles as it tries
to challenge regional-jet builders  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  and  Embraer
SA. (ERJ)  It was at least the second delay after Mitsubishi said in
April 2012 that the first flight was late while it confirmed
fabrication processes and completed technical studies.  “There will be some slight modification to deliveries,”
SkyWest Chief Financial Officer Michael Kraupp said by telephone
from the company’s headquarters in  St. George ,  Utah . “We’re
working those out, as we speak, with Mitsubishi. But in general,
it doesn’t change our strategy and the need for the aircraft.”  SkyWest, a commuter carrier that serves as a partner of
 United Airlines (UAL) , committed a year ago to 100 of the Mitsubishi
planes, valued at $4.2 billion. Montreal-based Bombardier, the
maker of the CRJ900 and CRJ1000 regional jets, historically had
supplied aircraft to SkyWest.  ‘Very Disappointed’  Trans States is “very disappointed” by the delay while
continuing to work closely with Mitsubishi to “minimize the
impact,” President Rick Leach said in an e-mailed statement.
The St. Louis-based airline  agreed  in 2009 to purchase 50
Mitsubishi jets with options for 50 more.  “The question now is whether Mitsubishi will hang onto all
of its orders,”  Chris Murray , an aerospace analyst at PI
Financial Corp., said in a telephone interview from Toronto.
“Theoretically, at least, the delay opens up opportunities for
Bombardier and Embraer.”  Mitsubishi Heavy rose 2.4 percent to 560 yen as of 11:15
a.m. in Tokyo trading, helping the stock advance 35 percent this
year. Bombardier rose 2.8 percent to C$4.70 in Toronto
yesterday, while Embraer slid 0.4 percent to 20.17 reais.  Mitsubishi Aircraft, 10 percent owned by  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) , has orders for 325 planes, according to yesterday’s
statement. Of that, 165 are firm and the remainder are options.
Other customers include Japan’s ANA Holdings Inc. and Indonesia-focused lessor ANI Group Holdings Ltd.  Dreamliner, A380 Delays  The planemaker cited delays in certification as the reason
for the latest postponement.  Delays for new aircraft are common in the industry.  Boeing
Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS, both with years of experience building
large, complicated jets, have had to push back introductions.  The 787 Dreamliner, Boeing’s most advanced jet, entered
commercial service at the end of 2011 after 3 1/2 years of
delays. ANA was the launch customer for that plane.  Airbus A380, the double-decker plane, began commercial
flights with  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  in 2007 after more than two
years of delays and cost overruns.  Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China is said to delay the
maiden test flight of the country’s first large passenger plane
to 2015 from an earlier plan for next year, four company
officials familiar with the plan said earlier this month.  Mitsubishi’s jet is designed to fly as far as 3,410
kilometers (2,119 miles), enough to reach anywhere in the
mainland U.S. from Chicago. The company forecasts global demand
for 5,000 regional jets over the 20 years to 2030.  To contact the reporters on this story:
