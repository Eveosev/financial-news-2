Steel reinforcement-bar futures
traded near the highest level in four months after China
reported better-than-expected manufacturing expansion.  Rebar for January delivery traded little changed at 3,784
 yuan  ($618) a metric ton at 10:25 a.m. local time, after
reaching as high as 3,799 yuan this morning. Futures touched a
four-month high at 3,848 yuan on Aug. 14.  The preliminary reading of 50.1 for a Purchasing Managers’
Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compares with a final figure of 47.7 in July. The number was
higher than all 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of
analysts. A number above 50 indicates an expansion.  “This is a nice big surprise to the markets,” said Lu Ting, head of Greater China economics at Bank of America Corp.
in Hong Kong. “Today’s HSBC flash PMI reading should be quite
positive to  market sentiment  and may bolster the Chinese
currency, commodities and other China-related assets.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port dropped 0.9
percent yesterday to $137.80 a dry ton, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  The average spot price of rebar fell for the first time in
13 days yesterday, falling 0.1 percent to 3,636 yuan a ton,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
