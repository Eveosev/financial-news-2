Video-game fans will keep Santa Claus busy this year . With Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo releasing their  first new machines in at least seven years  just in time for the holidays,  developers predict their new titles will top gift lists . Electronic Arts, Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft Entertainment and others swarmed Cologne, Germany, this week to woo gamers -- more than 275,000 are expected -- and get their pre-orders ahead of the key holiday season at Gamescom, Europe's biggest gaming conference.  For such a big event in the industry, preparation is key. But it's kind of difficult to plan for Gamescom when the normal day is anything but. Well, for me at least. 6:30 a.m.  Get up and join thousands of gamers already filling Cologne's streets. Bonus points if you're in costume. Highlights include characters from Zelda to Peach, the Mario princess. I also spotted a giant banana and monkey couple. 7:00 a.m.  Stand in line outside -- it was 13 degrees Celsius (55 degrees Fahrenheit) at sunrise. By the way, you'll spend most of the day queuing: first to get in, then to go hands-on with the new games. 10:00 a.m.  Opening bell! The gates open and let the gamers in. 10:01 a.m.  Now would be the right time to get some exercise: The conference center hall morphs into a race track as gamers sprint to be first in line to try their favorites from a list of upcoming blockbusters. Printouts of the conference hall's floor plan help them navigate the madness. 10:15 a.m.  Look left, look right: Get to know your neighbors because you're going to see a lot of them. You're in for a long wait -- just 15 minutes into Gamescom and the line-up in front of the biggest booths, whether it's EA's "Battlefield 4" or Ubisoft's "Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag," is already running four to five hours long, according to a security guard posted there. 10:30 a.m.  Get your new friends to keep your spot and grab some breakfast. Beer and pizza are the popular choice. Yes, I said breakfast. 11:00 a.m.  A 19-year-old student from Cologne -- still wearing his souvenir bracelet from last year's Gamescom -- is antsy to get inside Activision's giant "Call of Duty Ghosts" booth. Sure he's pre-ordered the game already, but he says he still needed to get there at 6:30 a.m. to be the first to play it. 1:00 p.m.  Gamers' hands overfloweth as the first rule of Gamescom is to grab every goodie in sight, from game-branded bags to flashy bracelets and plush toys of your favorite characters. 1:30 p.m.  Get some lunch. If conversation isn't your thing, don't worry: Many people play games on their smartphones while they eat. 3:00 p.m.  Take a screen break to give your eyes some rest. Boredom is not an option: Sponsors that make everything from energy drinks to toys have packed hall 10 with a skate park, go-kart, a laser-gun battlefield, a tiny track to race battery-powered cars on, as well as giant ping-pong and foosball tables. 5:00 p.m.  Admire one of the many extraordinary sights you'll witness only at Gamescom: The girls' washroom is empty, while boys queue up (again). That's what happens when maybe 90 percent of attendees are men. 6:15 p.m.  Get your picture taken with a mascot. Take your pick: zombie, assassin, special-ops agent, man in an orange radiation suitâ€¦. 8:00 p.m.  Go home. Not because you want to -- or maybe you do after this ordeal -- but because the doors are closing. Come back tomorrow and repeat from step one.
