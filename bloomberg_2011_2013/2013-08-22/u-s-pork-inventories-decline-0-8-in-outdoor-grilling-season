Pork stockpiles in the U.S. fell 0.8
percent at the end of July from a year earlier during the
outdoor grilling season, the government said.  Warehouses held 545.260 million pounds of pork, down from
 549.621 million  on July 31, 2012, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories fell 3.5 percent
from the end of June.  A drop in stockpiles is “pretty common” for this time of
year because the grilling season tends to peak in late June and
early July, which draws down the grilling cuts,  Dan Vaught , an
economist at Doane Advisory Services in  St. Louis , said in a
telephone interview before the report.  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.9 percent to
85.05 cents a pound at 9:39 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices have gained 0.1 percent this year through
yesterday.  As of July 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, rose 0.7 percent from a year earlier
to 28.145 million pounds, according to today’s report.  Warehouse supplies of ham rose 15.1 percent to 181.650
million pounds, the highest in records dating back to 1957.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of July were 5.3
percent larger than a year earlier at 685.092 million pounds,
the USDA said.  Beef supplies rose 0.6 percent to 463.921 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
