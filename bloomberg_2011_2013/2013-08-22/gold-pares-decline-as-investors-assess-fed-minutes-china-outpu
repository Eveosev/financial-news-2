Gold pared losses as investors
weighed the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s last meeting,
which reinforced expectations that stimulus will be tapered,
against an unexpected increase in  China ’s manufacturing.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.8 percent to $1,355.30 an ounce,
before trading 0.2 percent lower at $1,364.49 at 10:40 a.m. in
Singapore. Prices fell 0.3 percent yesterday after the minutes
of the July meeting showed policy makers were comfortable with a
plan to start reducing bond buying later this year if the
economy improves, with a few saying tapering may be needed soon.  Gold has slumped 19 percent this year on speculation that
the Fed will cut the $85 billion in monthly debt buying that
helped bullion cap a 12-year bull run last year. The Bloomberg
U.S. Dollar Index added 0.2 percent after gaining 0.6 percent
yesterday. Bullion pared losses after a preliminary Chinese
Purchasing Managers’ Index rose in August from an 11-month low.  “Gold got a lift from other metals after the Chinese PMI
data,” said Yang Xi, an analyst at Yongan Futures Co. in
Hangzhou, China. “Demand in China should continue whether the
economy is improving. The dollar’s strength on expectations for
a cut in Fed stimulus will counter gains.”  The World Gold Council estimates sales of jewelry, coins
and bars will reach as much as 1,000 metric tons in both  India 
and China, the largest buyers, this year as the rout spurs
demand, leading JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp.
to say prices are bottoming. China’s demand totaled 776.1 tons
last year, while India consumed 864.2 tons, council data show.  SPDR Falls  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed
exchange-traded product, fell to 913.52 metric tons yesterday,
taking this year’s contraction to 32 percent. In China, volumes
for the benchmark spot gold contract fell to 9,573 kilograms
yesterday from a two-week high of 10,926 kilograms on Aug. 20,
according to data from the Shanghai Gold Exchange.  Gold for December delivery declined as much as 1.1 percent
to $1,354.50 an ounce on the Comex in New York, before trading
at $1,363. Futures lost as much as 1 percent yesterday before
closing 0.2 percent lower.  Silver was little changed at $22.901 an ounce, erasing a
decline of as much as 1.8 percent. Platinum was little changed
at $1,514.60 an ounce, while palladium rose 0.5 percent to
$747.85 an ounce, snapping a four-day drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
