U.K. stocks  advanced, snapping three
days of losses for the FTSE 100 Index, after better-than-expected manufacturing data from Germany and  China .  IMI Plc (IMI)  gained 5.8 percent after posting first-half
adjusted pretax profit that beat analysts’ estimates and
forecasting improved trading for the remainder of the year.
Wolseley Plc added 4.3 percent after UBS AG raised its
recommendation on the largest distributor of plumbing and
heating products to buy.  The FTSE 100 rose 56.03 points, or 0.9 percent, to 6,446.87
at the close of trading in  London . The measure has still fallen
5.8 percent from a high on May 22 after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may reduce its monthly
bond purchases if the economy strengthens in line with
forecasts. The broader FTSE All-Share Index advanced 0.9 percent
today and Ireland’s ISEQ Index also added 0.9 percent.  “The story for much of the summer has been the improvement
in the macro backdrop and the expectation of a better growth
outlook,” Ashish Misra, who helps oversee $17 billion as head
of investment policy and research for Lloyds TSB Private Banking
in London, said in a phone interview. “Sentiment is generally
getting stronger. Over the next 12 months we should see
reasonable rates of returns from global equity markets.”  The volume of shares changing hands in  FTSE-100 (UKX)  listed
companies was 18 percent lower than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German PMI  A measure of German  manufacturing  compiled by  Markit
Economics  climbed to 52 in August from 50.7 in July. The  median
economist estimate  had called for a reading of 51.1, according
to a Bloomberg survey. A gauge of services advanced to 52.4,
beating the median estimate of 51.7. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Markit’s euro-area manufacturing index indicated growth for
a second month, rising to 51.3 in August from 50.3 in July. A
composite index covering services and factory output also
expanded for a second month, climbing to 51.7 from 50.5.  A gauge of Chinese manufacturing rose in August from an 11-month low. The preliminary reading of 50.1 for a  PMI Index (EC11FLAS) 
released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit compares with a
final figure of 47.7 in July. The number beat all 16 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey and was the first reading since April
above the 50 mark that divides contraction from expansion.  In the U.S., the Federal Open Market Committee’s minutes
from the July 30-31 gathering released yesterday showed
officials were “broadly comfortable” with Bernanke’s plan to
start reducing bond buying later this year if the economy
continues to improve. Several members said the central bank may
need to start tapering soon.  U.S. Jobless  The fewest workers in more than five years applied for U.S.
unemployment benefits over the past month, a Labor Department
report showed today in  Washington . The number of claims in the
month ended Aug. 17 declined to 330,500 a week  on average , the
least since November 2007. Compared with a  week earlier , claims
rose by 13,000 to 336,000, in line with the  median  forecast of
48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  IMI rallied 5.8 percent to 1,491 pence, the highest price
since at least 1988. The manufacturer of soda dispensers and
air-conditioning equipment said first-half adjusted pretax
profit rose 1 percent to 170 million pounds ($265 million),
beating the 164 million pounds average analyst projection.  Wolseley (WOS)  added 4.3 percent to 3,330 pence. UBS raised its
recommendation on the shares to buy from neutral, citing
accelerating U.S. growth, improving U.K. momentum and
stabilization in  Europe . The bank also added Wolseley to its
most preferred list of stocks.  Commodity Producers  A gauge of mining companies in the FTSE 350 Index rose,
snapping a three-day losing streak, as the price of metals
advanced following the better-than-expected Chinese
manufacturing data. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest
miner, climbed 1.9 percent to 1,908.5 pence. Rio Tinto Group,
the second-largest, added 1.9 percent.  Fresnillo Plc, a producer of gold and silver, jumped 4.4
percent to 1,215 pence, its highest price in more than four
months. Vedanta Resources Plc, the metals producer controlled by
billionaire  Anil Agarwal , rose 2.9 percent to 1,194.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  lost 4.1 percent to 71 pence. The
unprofitable Czech coal company, which reported a wider-than-forecast loss of 315.4 million euros ($420.9 million) today,
expects to complete the sale of its OKK coking unit this year
and receive cash from the deal.  “We are currently negotiating a share-purchase agreement
with several potential buyers,” Chief Financial Officer Marek
Jelinek said by telephone today.  Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  slid 2.9 percent to 346.5 pence. The energy
