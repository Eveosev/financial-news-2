Carlsberg A/S (CARLB)  is importing beer to
Denmark ahead of a potential shortage after a labor dispute at
one of its breweries in the country halted production.  “We are working very hard now on getting supplies from
other countries to our customers,” Jens Bekke, a spokesman,
said today. “This is not a conflict between Carlsberg and the
unions, it’s more a conflict between some employees.”  Last week, 130 workers at its Fredericia brewery walked out
because a new hire isn’t affiliated to the same union as other
employees. The brewery, which has 800 workers, makes all of
Carlsberg’s draft beer in Denmark. Production of soft drinks was
also affected. Carlsberg has about one week’s stock of draft
products and its customers typically hold inventory of one to
two weeks.  The workers who have been on strike since Aug. 14 will meet
again at 6 a.m. tomorrow, Bekke said. A labor court has ordered
the workers to be fined for every hour they are on strike, and
Carlsberg has applied to the court for permission to fire them
as their action is against the union agreement.  Bekke said the application shouldn’t be considered a
hostile move and is just part of the legal procedure. “This is
just how rules are in  Denmark ,” he said. “We need to have
acceptance that we can do it, we have not decided to do it.”  Carlsberg has been hit by strikes in Denmark before. In
2010, employees walked out when the company changed rules on
drinking alcohol at work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
