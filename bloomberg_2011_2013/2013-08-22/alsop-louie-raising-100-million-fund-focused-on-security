Alsop Louie Partners, a San
Francisco-based venture-capital firm, is raising $100 million
for its third fund and has promoted former National Security
Agency Deputy Director William Crowell to general partner.  The raising of the fund, Alsop Louie Capital 3 LP, was
disclosed yesterday in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Stewart Alsop, the firm’s co-founder,
confirmed the fundraising plans in a phone interview and said
that Crowell, who joined in 2011, will be the third general
partner.  Should the firm meet its fundraising goal, the new fund
will be the same size as the second one from 2010. Alsop said
about one-third of the investments will go into security-related
companies, an area of expertise for the firm. In addition to
Crowell’s background at the NSA and as chief executive officer
of security solutions provider Cylink Corp., co-founder Gilman Louie previously ran In-Q-Tel, the investing arm of the Central
Intelligence Agency.  “We get really great deal flow and access to deals that
others don’t see,” Alsop said.  While Alsop Louie hasn’t backed any companies that have
reached $1 billion valuations, there may be some on the way,
Alsop said. Storage startup Cleversafe Inc. raised $55 million
this week in a deal led by New Enterprise Associates. Alsop
worked at NEA until 2004 and co-founded Alsop Louie a little
over a year later.  The firm’s biggest success in security so far was
NetWitness Corp., which was purchased by EMC Corp. in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
