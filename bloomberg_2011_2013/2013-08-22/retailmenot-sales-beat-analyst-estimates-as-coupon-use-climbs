RetailMeNot Inc. (SALE) , an online coupon
provider, reported revenue that beat analysts’ estimates in its
first earnings announcement as a public company after more
consumers used the site to search for discounts.  Second-quarter sales climbed 44 percent to $43.4 million,
the company said today in a  statement , beating the $42.2 million
average analyst prediction, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company reported a net loss attributable to
shareholders of $999,000 because of costs associated with
preferred stock dividends.  RetailMeNot has gained popularity with its more than
500,000 coupons at online and physical stores, including  Home
Depot Inc. (HD) ,  Walgreen Co. (WAG)  and Amazon.com Inc. The Austin, Texas-based company, which provides discounts at more than 50,000
retailers, is vying for greater share of the high-margin Web
coupon market as more consumers search for deals on their
laptops and smartphones.  “Over the last decade, the emergence of digital coupons
has changed the landscape,” Chief Executive Officer Cotter
Cunnigham said on today’s conference call. “We didn’t invent
the coupon and we didn’t bring it online. What we did do is
create a marketplace.”  RetailMeNot has  surged  43 percent since its debut on the
Nasdaq Stock Market on July 18, for a market capitalization of
about $1.5 billion. The stock fell less than 1 percent to $29.93
at the close in  New York . The company and shareholders sold 9.1
million shares for $21 each in the initial public offering.  Sales Forecast  Third-quarter sales will be $45 million to $46 million, the
company forecast on the call. Analysts on average are projecting
revenue of $45 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Excluding expenses related to stock dividends, net income
fell 5.6 percent to $5.12 million from $5.44 million in the same
period last year because of increased investments in product
development and sales and marketing, the company said.  By attracting customers mostly through  online search  and
keeping down advertising costs, RetailMeNot had a 93 percent
gross margin in the period. Its margin in 2012 was 94 percent,
wider than any company in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
more than 20 percentage points higher than  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  or
 Facebook Inc. (FB)   The U.S. online coupon market may reach 104.9 million by
2015, a 14 percent  increase  from 2012, according to EMarketer
Inc. The researcher estimates the number of U.S. adult
smartphone users who also use coupons will increase 32 percent
to 40.8 million in 2013 from the prior year.  Mobile Growth  RetailMeNot’s mobile revenue more than tripled to $5
million from $1.4 million a year earlier, accounting for just 12
percent of total sales.  “Although mobile and in-store initiatives represent a
potential growth runway and a means of driving multichannel
engagement for RetailMeNot, the company is in the early stages
of developing its mobile capabilities,”  Mark Mahaney , an
analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in  San Francisco , wrote in an
Aug. 18 note to clients.  Cunningham , formerly chief operating officer at  Bankrate
Inc. (RATE) , started the couponer in 2009. RetailMeNot offers
promotions such as 20 percent off purchases at  Macy’s Inc. (M) , $30
off a Kindle Fire from Amazon and a $2 smoothie from Jamba
Juice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
