Taiwan’s five-year bonds fell the
most in almost three weeks on speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will begin tapering asset purchases as early as next month. The
local dollar weakened.  Fed policy makers were “broadly comfortable” with scaling
back stimulus policies known as quantitative easing later this
year if the economy improves, according to minutes of their last
meeting released yesterday. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields
reached a two-year high following the report.  “Taiwan bonds have been mainly affected by Treasuries,”
said  James Wang , a Taipei-based trader at Yuanta Securities Co.
“Before we know the exact timing of QE tapering, the markets
will continue to reflect this factor.”  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018 rose
3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, from Aug. 20 to 1.1710
percent in Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market prices.
That is the biggest increase since Aug. 2. Taiwan’s financial
markets were shut yesterday as Severe Tropical Storm Trami
brought steady rains.  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.1 percent to NT$30.127 against
its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The
currency was trading 0.5 percent stronger 17 minutes before the
4 p.m. close on Aug. 20. The central bank has sold its currency
in the run-up to the close on most days since March 2012,
according to traders who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1 percent today
to NT$29.950 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 35 basis points
today to 4.09 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was unchanged at 0.386
percent today, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center showed.  Taiwan’s unemployment rate rose to 4.18 percent in July
from 4.17 percent a month earlier, matching the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
