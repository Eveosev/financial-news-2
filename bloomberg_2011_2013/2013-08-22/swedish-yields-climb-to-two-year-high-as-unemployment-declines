Sweden ’s 10-year government bonds
fell, pushing yields to a two-year  high , after a report showing
unemployment unexpectedly declined last month boosted bets the
nation’s central bank will raise  interest rates .  The additional yield investors demand to hold Swedish 10-year debt over German bunds rose after Riksbank Deputy Governor
Kerstin af Jochnick told reporters that Sweden’s economy is
heading in the right direction. The central bank last month kept
its  main lending rate  at 1 percent for a third meeting after
cutting it four times in a year as it predicted growth prospects
around the world will improve. The nation sold $3 billion of
three-year notes via banks.  “We had a very strong labor market report,” said Mikael Nilsson Rosell, an analyst at Barclays Plc in  London . “The
combination of the central bank repeating their concerns that
too low a policy rate for too long might nourish medium-term
systemic risks, and also stronger data, made the  bond market 
sell off.”  Sweden’s 10-year yield climbed nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 2.49 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
reaching 2.51 percent, the most since Aug. 1, 2011. The 1.5
percent bond due in November 2023 fell 0.75, or 7.5 kronor per
1,000-kronor ($153.41) face amount, to 91.17.  The yield  spread  over similar-maturity German bunds
increased four basis points to 57 basis points, the widest since
July 23, based on closing prices.  Unemployment Falls  The seasonally adjusted  unemployment rate  fell to 7.8
percent in July from a revised 7.9 percent the previous month,
 Statistics Sweden  said today. The median estimate of 10
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase to 8.1
percent. The non-seasonally adjusted  rate  fell to 7.2 percent
from 9.1 percent.  Sweden sold 1 percent dollar-denominated notes maturing in
November 2016 via banks, priced to yield three basis points
below the benchmark mid-swap rate.  Swedish bonds lost investors 3.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Norwegian
debt fell 1.7 percent in the same period, while German
securities declined 2.3 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
