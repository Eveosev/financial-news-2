The cost of insuring corporate bonds
against losses fell in  Europe  as German manufacturing expanded
faster than analysts expected.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on
125 companies with investment-grade ratings fell 1.6 basis
points to 104.6 at 9:18 a.m. in London, paring a 7.3 basis-point
rise this week. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly speculative-grade ratings dropped 3.8
basis points to 430 basis points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
