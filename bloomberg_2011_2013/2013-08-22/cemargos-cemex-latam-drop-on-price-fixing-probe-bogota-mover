Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS)  and  Cemex Latam
Holdings SA (CLH)  tumbled after Colombian regulators said they are
investigating alleged price fixing in the cement industry.  Cemargos, the country’s largest cement maker by market
value, fell 1.3 percent to 8,910 pesos at 11:57 a.m. in Bogota.
Cemex Latam fell 2.9 percent to 15,020 pesos. They were the two
worst performers on the benchmark Colcap index, which declined
0.2 percent.  The Superintendency of Industry and Commerce has opened an
investigation of five cement companies including Cemargos and
Cemex Latam for “an alleged agreement to fix prices and divide
up the market,” according to an e-mailed statement from the
industry regulator after the close of trading yesterday. They
could be fined as much as 59 billion pesos ($31 million) each if
found to have violated  Colombia ’s free competition laws, the
superintendency said.  The investigation will create a “short-term overhang,”
Credit Suisse Group AG analysts including Vanessa Quiroga wrote
in a report yesterday. “The news may hamper expectations for
additional price increases.”  Cemargos Chief Executive officer Jorge Mario Velasquez
urged investors to be calm on a conference call today, saying
the company “doesn’t participate, and hasn’t and won’t
participate and doesn’t base its competitive strategy on
agreements that limit competition, that lead to a division of
the market or to price fixing.”  Jorge Perez , a spokesman for Cemex in Monterrey,  Mexico ,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
