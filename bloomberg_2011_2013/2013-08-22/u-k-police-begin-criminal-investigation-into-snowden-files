U.K. police started a criminal
investigation into U.S. national security data seized from a
journalist’s partner at  Heathrow airport  in London.  The computer files taken from David Miranda contained
“highly sensitive material, the disclosure of which could put
lives at risk,” the  Metropolitan Police Service  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Miranda, 28, was held for questioning for as long as nine
hours at London’s Heathrow airport Aug. 18 under the Terrorism
Act. His partner, Glenn Greenwald, who reported for the  Guardian
newspaper  on former security contractor Edward Snowden’s
allegations of U.S. surveillance programs, said he intends to
publish revelations on U.K. intelligence after the incident.  Miranda, who was arrested as he changed planes, partially
won an injunction application at a London court today to prevent
the U.K. government from sharing the data. The files can be
inspected by police for national security reasons, a judicial
spokeswoman said.  U.K. terrorism police are leading the investigation.  Miranda was returning to  Rio de Janeiro  from Berlin, where
he had spent a week with Laura Poitras, a U.S. filmmaker who has
worked on the National Security Agency stories with Snowden and
Greenwald, the Guardian reported. The U.K. newspaper said it
paid for Miranda’s flights and that, while he isn’t a Guardian
employee, he often assists Greenwald in his work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
