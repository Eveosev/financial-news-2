China Merchants Bank Co. (3968)  plans to
raise 34.8 billion yuan ($5.68 billion) in the world’s second-largest share sale this year starting Aug. 26, bolstering its
capital as regulatory requirements tighten.  Merchants will offer a total of 3.75 billion Shanghai and
Hong Kong-traded shares at 9.29 yuan or HK$11.68 each, it said
in  regulatory filings  yesterday. That represents a 15 percent
discount to yesterday’s closing price in Shanghai, or an 18
percent discount to the  Hong Kong  shares.  The sale will help  Merchants Bank , the nation’s sixth
largest, plug a capital shortfall and speed up growth as
competition with smaller rivals such as  China Minsheng Banking
Corp. (1988)  and  Industrial Bank Co. (601166)  intensifies. Chinese lenders have
announced plans this year to raise as much as 290 billion  yuan 
from bond and equity offerings as the regulator tightens capital
rules and policy makers crack down on short-term financing.  “A stronger capital base will help China Merchants Bank
achieve its strategies of increasing loans to small firms and
expanding overseas, both of which require significant capital
consumption,” said Mu Hua, a Guangzhou-based analyst at GF
Securities Co. “China banks’ growth model means they have to
replenish capital every few years, though the interval is
getting longer with improvement in their earnings ability.”  Shares of Merchants Bank lost 1.1 percent to close at
HK$14.02 in Hong Kong, bringing their decline for the year to 18
percent. The bank fell 3.2 percent in  Shanghai  to 10.56 yuan,
giving up earlier gains.  Merchants Bank, which has postponed the sale twice because
of approval delays, said July 22 it planned to raise as much as
35 billion yuan.  Capital Adequacy  Merchants Bank’s capital adequacy ratio fell to 10.72
percent as of June 30 from 11.41 percent at the beginning of the
year, and its core Tier 1 ratio dropped to 8 percent from 8.34
percent, according to its first-half earnings report. While both
measurements are higher than the minimum regulatory requirement,
they are among the lowest at Hong Kong-listed mainland lenders.  The bank will use the sale proceeds to strengthen its
capital and support business growth, according to yesterday’s
exchange filings. A crackdown in June 2013 on off-balance-sheet
lending and  other credit  outside the banking system, known as
shadow banking, helped drive  money-market rates  to a record,
cutting off smaller banks’ borrowing on the  interbank market .  Cash Crunch  The cash crunch had an immediate impact on some banks’
operations. Shanghai-based Bank of Communications Co. reduced
new lending and temporarily suspended short-term billing
financing in June to maintain liquidity, Vice President Yu Yali
told reporters Aug. 21.  Larger lenders Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.,
China Construction Bank Corp. and Bank of China Ltd. have
announced plans to raise as much as 60 billion yuan each from
new tier-2 capital instruments with a writedown mechanism
triggered by a drop in their  capital ratios .  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. plans to sell 50 billion
yuan of similar debt, and raise another 40 billion yuan to boost
tier 1 capital. Industrial Bank said Aug. 12 it plans to raise
20 billion yuan of supplementary capital.  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) ’s 747 billion-yen ($7.6 billion)
offering in March is the largest this year.  Merchants Bank’s sale will improve its Tier 1 ratio by more
than 1 percentage point, to more than 9 percent, and boost its
share price, May Yan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Barclays Plc
