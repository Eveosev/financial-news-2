Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s third-biggest iron ore producer, said full-year
profit increased 12 percent to a record after costs fell and
output rose.  Net income  was $1.75 billion, or 56.07 cents a share, in
the 12 months ended June 30, from $1.56 billion, or 50.07 cents,
a year earlier, the Perth-based company said today in a
statement. The average of 13 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was $1.73 billion.  Offers for a stake in Fortescue’s rail and port assets
haven’t met its objectives, the company said in the statement.
Fortescue, which this month agreed a $1.15 billion investment
with  Taiwan ’s Formosa Plastics Group, is aiming to boost
capacity to 155 million metric tons.  Fortescue, which in December started negotiations to sell
the minority stake in the port and rail unit, was little changed
at A$4.08 at 11:38 a.m. in Sydney.  Costs for the year fell to $44 a wet metric ton, 9 percent
lower than the previous year, Fortescue said. The company
shipped 81 million tons, up 41 percent, it said.  Fortescue last year agreed $5 billion in new loans after
 iron ore  prices plunged, prompting the company to hold asset
sale talks to reduce debt. The price of iron ore is forecast to
decline for at least the next three years as supply rises and
amid a slowing rate of demand growth in  China , the biggest
buyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
