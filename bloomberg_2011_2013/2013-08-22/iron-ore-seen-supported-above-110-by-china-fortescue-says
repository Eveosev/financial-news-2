Iron ore prices will remain strong
as sustained economic growth in  China , the biggest buyer,
supports demand, according to  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG)   Prices will stay between $110 a ton and $130 a ton in the
short to medium term, Chief Executive Office Neville Power said
in an interview on Bloomberg Television today. The break-even
price at  Australia ’s third-biggest exporter is “in the low $70
per ton,” he said.  Iron ore entered a  bull market  last month as China
replenished stockpiles. While the country’s expansion slowed to
7.5 percent last quarter from 7.7 percent in the previous three
months, data this month showed pickups in trade, manufacturing
and industrial output. China will reach the government’s 7.5
percent growth target this year and maintain that pace in 2014,
a Bloomberg survey of economists indicates.  “We see it continuing strong and growing at that 7 to 8
percent for the foreseeable future,” Power said, referring to
the expansion of the Chinese economy. Growth of 7.5 percent “is
a very, very strong underlying growth number,” he said.  Iron ore  with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin declined 0.9 percent to $137.80 a dry ton
yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd. Prices have rallied
25 percent since falling to a seven-month low in May, averaging
$135.49 since the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
