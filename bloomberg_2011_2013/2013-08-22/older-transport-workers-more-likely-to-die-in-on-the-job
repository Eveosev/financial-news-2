Employees age 55 or older who drive
as part of their jobs are more likely to be killed in accidents
than younger colleagues because of declining cognition and
greater susceptibility to injury, according to a U.S. report.  Employees who drive for work aged 55 to 64 were about 50
percent more likely to die in an accident, and those 65 and
older were three times as likely to die, the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said in a study today. Highway
accidents are the leading cause of  workplace deaths  in the U.S.  The problem is likely to worsen as more Americans work
deeper into their twilight years. People 55 years or older are
projected to comprise 25 percent of the U.S. workforce in 2020,
more than double the 12 percent share in 1990. The CDC said
transportation companies can adapt by considering less nighttime
driving, better-planned routes and refresher driver training.  “The safety of older workers who drive motor vehicles at
work is of particular concern for employers, health
professionals, and occupational safety professionals,” the CDC
said. Companies with older employees “should consider allowing
drivers to use their judgment to reschedule travel or stop
driving in cases of fatigue, illness, bad weather, or
darkness.”  Vehicle collisions  accounted for the highest number of
workplace transportation deaths, as opposed to single-vehicle
accidents, the CDC said. Drivers, rather than passengers or
pedestrians, were the most likely to be killed. The statistics
don’t include people commuting to and from work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
