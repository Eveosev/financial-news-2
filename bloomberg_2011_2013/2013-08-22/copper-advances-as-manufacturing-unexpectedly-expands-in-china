Copper futures in  New York  rose for
the second time in three days after manufacturing unexpectedly
expanded in China, the world’s largest consumer of the metal.  A factory index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics showed a preliminary reading of 50.1 for
August, compared with a median estimate of 48.2 in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. Levels above 50 signal growth. Exports
from China rebounded in July, and  service industries  and factory
output expanded at a faster rate, reports showed this month.  “Support for copper is coming from the Chinese
manufacturing report,” Grant Barratt, a trader at Jefferies
Bache LLC in New York, said in a telephone interview. “The
market can’t ignore the data from  China  that we’ve seen lately,
and prices are picking up on the back of that.”  Copper futures for delivery in December added 0.7 percent
to settle at $3.3345 a pound at 1:11 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Copper has climbed 9.1 percent since the end of June, on
pace for the biggest quarterly gain since the three months ended
March 31, 2012.  Inventories monitored by the  London  Metal Exchange slid for
a 27th session to 565,500 metric tons. The stretch is the
longest since February 2012. Orders to withdraw the metal from
warehouses fell for a 12th time in 13 sessions, to 294,450 tons.  “The Chinese economy would appear to be back on the road
to recovery, which should be reflected in robust demand for
metals and lend support to prices,”  Daniel Briesemann , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said by e-mail today.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months increased
1.1 percent to $7,320 a ton ($3.32 a pound).  Nickel, tin and zinc also advanced in London. Aluminum and
lead fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
