Treasury yields reached two-year
highs as reports showed a strengthening jobs market and a gain
in economic indicators, suggesting the recovery is strong enough
for the Federal Reserve to begin withdrawing monetary stimulus.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was little changed
after climbing to 2.93 percent, the most since July 2011.
Minutes of the Fed’s last policy meeting released yesterday
showed officials are comfortable with a plan to start reducing
bond buying later this year if the economy improves. The U.S.
sold $16 billion of five-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities at the highest yield since 2010.  “Economic growth is continuing at a moderate pace,” said
Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which oversees $11 billion in fixed-income assets. “We’ve pretty much priced in the effects of the
Fed slowing down bond buying later this year.”  Ten-year  yields  dropped less than one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.89 percent at 4:59 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 2.5 percent
benchmark note due in August 2023 rose 2/32, or 63 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 96 21/32.  The  30-year (USGG30YR)  bond yield slipped five basis points to 3.87
percent after touching 3.94 percent, the most since August 2011.  Relative Strength  An indicator of  momentum  used by some dealers signaled that
the long bond was approaching oversold levels yesterday. The 14-day relative-strength index for the 30-year security dropped to
63, from 68 yesterday. A level above 70 indicates it has climbed
too much. The last time it exceeded that level was July 5, which
was followed by a two-week rally.  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, rose to $369 billion,
from $360 billion yesterday. The figure is down from a 2013 high
of $662 billion reached on May 22 and up from a low of $148
billion on Aug. 9. The 2013 average is $313.4 billion.  Treasuries have lost investors 3.9 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond  Index. (BUSY)   U.S. government securities due in a decade and longer
plunged 14 percent in the 12 months through yesterday, the
biggest loss of 174 debt indexes tracked by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  “The market is saying that the Fed will be tapering,”
said Michael Franzese, senior vice president of fixed-income
trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. “Everybody is
trying to get ahead of everybody else, that’s what’s
perpetuating this downward spiral. The market is way ahead of
itself.”  Leading Indicators  The number of jobless claims in the month ended Aug. 17
declined to 330,500 a week  on average , the least since November
2007, a Labor Department report showed. Compared with a  week
earlier , claims rose by 13,000 to 336,000, in line with the
 median  forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The index of U.S. leading indicators rose in July by the
most in three months, showing the world’s largest economy will
improve in the second half of 2013. The Conference Board’s gauge
of the outlook for the next three to six months increased 0.6
percent after no change the prior month, the New York-based
group said. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists called for a 0.5 percent advance.  The Fed’s debate over when to taper $85 billion in monthly
bond buying has roiled financial markets around the world and
sparked a selloff in fixed-income assets. The Fed today
purchased $1.496 billion in Treasuries maturing from February
2036 to February 2043.  TIPS Auction  The TIPS sold today yielded negative 0.127 percent, the
highest yield since April 2010, with investors wary of paying a
premium to guard against the threat of rising consumer prices.
The last sale, an $18 billion offering on April 18, drew a yield
of negative 1.311 percent, the second-lowest on record, after
the securities sold at a record negative 1.496 percent in
December 2012.  “There are still difficult times ahead for TIPS, as there
is caution from investors in reengaging the market fully after
the big selloff we’ve seen,” said Carlos Pro, an interest-rate
strategist at primary dealer Credit Suisse Group AG in New York.
“There is a challenging outlook for inflation, with
disinflation still a risk in the U.S. And that backdrop combines
with the likely September taper from the Fed.”  TIPS have fallen 9.4 percent in 2013, set for the steepest
annual loss since they were first sold in 1997, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Demand Metrics  Investors bid for 2.18 times the amount offered at today’s
sale, the same as the April auction of the securities and the
lowest  level  since October 2008. The average at the past 10
sales was 2.77.  Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks,
purchased 38.2 percent of the sale, the lowest level since
August 2012. Direct bidders purchased 8.1 percent, compared with
the average of 8.9 percent for the past 10 sales.  The Fed has said it plans to keep benchmark interest rates
near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5
percent and inflation is no more than 2.5 percent.  The U.S. will auction $34 billion in two-year notes on Aug.
27, the first cut in the offering size after selling $35 billion
of the securities each month since October 2010.  “One billion dollars is not huge, but the deficit is
coming down,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in
New York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for
institutional investors. “The funding needs are fading.”  Offering Reduction  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $35 billion in five-year
notes on Aug. 28 and $29 billion in seven-year debt the next
day, with the size of both maturities unchanged since 2010.  The Treasury Department said July 31 it expects to
gradually decrease coupon-auction sizes during the coming
quarter as the nation’s fiscal health improves.  The  Federal budget   deficit  for July was $97.6 billion,
bringing the total for fiscal 2013, which ends Sept. 30, to
$607.4 billion, the lowest to date since 2008, the Treasury said
on Aug. 12.  Primary dealers expected the Fed to reduce the pace of its
asset purchases in September by $15 billion, to $70 billion a
month, a July survey showed.  The median forecast in the survey by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York saw the central bank buying $35 billion of
Treasuries and $35 billion of mortgage-backed securities next
month, according to the survey conducted before the Federal Open
Market Committee’s July 30-31 meeting. The FOMC’s next meeting
is scheduled for Sept. 17-18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
