Commodities may fall 11 percent by
the second quarter next year as the biggest rally in 11 months
runs “out of steam,” according to technical analysis by
Commerzbank AG.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw
materials will first slide toward its 200-week moving average at
4,781.68 before testing 4,442.35, the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement of its advance between 2009 and 2011,  Axel Rudolph ,
a London-based technical analyst at Commerzbank, said in an Aug.
20 report. The decline is forecast by the second quarter next
year, he said by e-mail today.  “We would expect this 4,442 zone to hold the initial
test,” Rudolph wrote. “Failure to do so would see losses to
4,212.50, the 2012 low.”  The S&P GSCI Total Return Index, reflecting the cost of
maintaining positions in futures markets, gained 1.3 percent
this month to 4,915.4 by 9:31 a.m. in London, heading for the
third monthly advance. The gauge is up 0.5 percent this year
after a 4.9 percent jump in July, the biggest since August 2012.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching highs or lows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
