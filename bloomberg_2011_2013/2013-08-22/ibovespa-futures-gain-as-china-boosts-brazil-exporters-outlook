Ibovespa  futures  advanced, a day
after the equity index posted a second consecutive decline, as
data showing manufacturing in  China  unexpectedly expanded
boosted the economic outlook for  Brazil ’s top trading partner.  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the iron-ore producer founded
by  Eike Batista , may move after Morgan Stanley cut it to the
equivalent of sell. Lender  Banco do Brasil SA  may be active
after saying it postponed a decision to increase its stake in
Banco Votorantim.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in October jumped 1.4
to 50,500 at 9:46 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real climbed 0.5
percent to 2.4425 per dollar. The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month
Price Commodity Index rose 0.9 percent.  A preliminary purchasing managers’ index for China from
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics climbed to 50.1 from
47.7, exceeding all 16 estimates among economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The Ibovespa has gained 12 percent from this year’s low on
July 3 as higher commodities prices and a weaker real boosted
raw-material exporters. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21
developing nations’ equities advanced 0.9 percent during the
same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
