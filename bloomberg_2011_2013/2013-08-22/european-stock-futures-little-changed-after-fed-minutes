European stocks  climbed the most in
three weeks as a report showed Germany’s manufacturing and
services industries expanded at a faster-than-expected pace.  Royal Ahold NV rallied the most since May 2009 after the
Dutch owner of the Stop & Shop supermarket chain reported
second-quarter underlying operating income that exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  IMI Plc (IMI)  rose to its highest price since at
least 1988 after posting first-half adjusted pretax profit that
beat analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 1 percent to 303.55 at the
close of trading as more than five shares rose for every one
that fell. The equity benchmark has  rallied 10 percent  from this
year’s low on June 24 as the European Central Bank said that
interest rates will remain low for an extended period.  “The euro zone’s growth engine is doing well,” Witold Bahrke, who helps oversee $55 billion as a senior strategist at
PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen, wrote in an e-mail. “Together
with some relief from  China  hard-landing fears in the shape of
stronger flash PMI there, this supports European equities, since
domestic stabilization is being accompanied by positive macro
news from one of the most important export markets.”  A measure of German  manufacturing  compiled by  Markit
Economics  climbed to 52 in August from 50.7 in July. The  median
economist estimate  had called for a reading of 51.1, according
to a Bloomberg survey. The company’s gauge of services advanced
to 52.4, beating the median estimate of 51.7.  Chinese Manufacturing  In China, a purchasing managers’ index of manufacturing
from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit rose to 50.1 in August from
47.7 in July. Economists had predicted the PMI would climb to
48.2. Readings greater than 50 mean that activity increased.  The Federal Reserve published the minutes from its July
30-31 meeting late yesterday. They showed that almost all the
participants agreed with Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s plan to
start reducing bond buying later this year if the economy
continues to improve in line with forecasts.  The Federal Open Market Committee continued to expect that
growth will accelerate in the second half of 2013 and into 2014.
After the July meeting, policy makers affirmed a pledge to
continue bond buying until they see evidence that “the outlook
for the labor market has improved substantially.”  A Labor Department report showed that initial claims for
 unemployment benefits  in the U.S. rose to 336,000 last week from
a revised 323,000 in the preceding week. That beat the median
 economist estimate  of 330,000 in a Bloomberg survey.  Volumes Drop  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 15 percent lower than the average of the last
100 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes declined in every western-European market today, except Greece and Iceland.  Germany ’s DAX
added 1.4 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.9 percent.
 France ’s CAC 40 rose 1.1 percent.  Ahold jumped 5.2 percent to 12.86 euros. The retailer said
quarterly underlying operating income gained 5.4 percent to 338
million euros ($452 million), beating the 323.8 million-euro
average estimate of 10 analysts. The company said it may make
acquisitions to expand into new markets.  Separately, JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised the shares to
overweight, similar to a buy rating, from neutral.  “We continue to view Ahold as a well managed company with
relatively high earnings visibility,” analysts led by Jaime Vazquez wrote in a note. “The company has very comfortable
positions in the markets where it operates.”  Home Retail Group Plc, the owner of the Argos catalog
chain, added 3.6 percent to 150.3 pence. Inditex SA, the world’s
largest clothing retailer, rose 3.1 percent to 103.50 euros. A
gauge of European retailers advanced 1.3 percent.  IMI Advances  IMI surged 5.8 percent to 1,491 pence. The maker of air-conditioning equipment said first-half adjusted pretax profit
rose 1 percent to 170 million pounds ($265 million). That
exceeded the  average analyst projection  of 164 million pounds in
a Bloomberg survey.  A gauge of banks contributed the most to the Stoxx 600’s
rally as yields on 10-year Spanish and Italian bonds dropped.
Banco Popular Espanol SA jumped 5.6 percent to 3.99 euros,
UniCredit SpA advanced 3.7 percent to 4.57 euros and Banco
Espirito Santo SA rallied 5.2 percent to 90.4 euro cents.  Wolseley Plc (WOS)  gained 4.3 percent to 3,330 pence after UBS AG
raised its recommendation on the world’s largest distributor of
plumbing and heating products. The brokerage raised  the shares 
to buy from neutral, citing accelerating growth in the U.S.,
improving momentum in the U.K. and stabilization in Europe.  BioMerieux added 0.9 percent to 77.64 euros. The French
maker of tests for HIV and hepatitis won approval from the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration  to market the first mass
spectrometer for automated identification of bacteria and yeasts
known to cause serious illness.  Premier Oil Plc lost 2.9 percent to 346.5 pence, the
biggest drop in almost three months. The energy explorer
reported first-half net income of $161 million, falling short of
the average analyst estimate of $180 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
