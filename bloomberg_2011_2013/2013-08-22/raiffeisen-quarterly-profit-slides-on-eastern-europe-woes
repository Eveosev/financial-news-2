Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) ,
eastern Europe’s second-biggest bank, said second-quarter profit
tumbled and  capital ratios  shrank amid an economic downturn in
the region.  Net income fell 25 percent from a year ago to 120 million
euros ($160 million), the Vienna-based bank said in a statement
today. It was expected to report profit of 136 million euros,
according to a poll of 22 analysts held by the company.
Raiffeisen’s core Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial
strength, slid to 10.4 percent on June 30 from 10.7 percent at
the end of 2012.  “We are continuously evaluating the level and structure of
our regulatory capital to be able to act promptly and
flexibly,” Raiffeisen said. “Depending on market developments,
a capital increase also continues to be a possible option.”  Bolstering capital is the biggest challenge facing
Raiffeisen’s new chief executive officer Karl Sevelda, who was
appointed in June. While investors and regulators have pushed
for a share sale, he has to overcome opposition at Raiffeisen
Zentralbank Oesterreich AG, the bank’s parent company that is
owned by 494 local cooperatives.  Profit before tax in central  Europe  dropped to 71 million
euros in the second quarter from 111 million euros a year
earlier, due to lower income from asset valuations of financial
investments and higher administrative expenses, the bank said.
Pretax profit in southeastern Europe fell 19 percent to 154
million euros, it said.  Second-quarter net interest income rose 10 percent to 972
million euros while provisions for bad loans climbed less than 1
percent to 249 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
