CCX Carvao da Colombia SA , the coal
unit of Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , fell after saying it
has no deal to sell its Colombian mining projects.  The shares  declined  0.6 percent to 1.59 reais at 2:15 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo  after earlier slumping as much as 14 percent in the
biggest intraday drop since July 1. The BM&FBovespa Small Cap
Index declined 0.2 percent.  CCX soared 65 percent in the three days through yesterday
on speculation Batista had found a buyer for the company’s
assets in Colombia, where it obtained coal-mining licenses and
planned to build a port and a railway system. The company, which
is based in Rio de Janeiro, said in a regulatory filing after
the market closed yesterday that it hasn’t signed any contract
to sell the projects.  Batista is cutting costs and selling stakes in his natural
resources and logistics companies after production and profit
missed targets, erasing more than $33.5 billion of his fortune
since March 2012.  EIG Global Energy Partners LLC offered 1.3 billion reais
($535 million) on Aug. 14 for part of  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) ,
Batista’s port operator. EON SE, Germany’s biggest utility,
increased its stake in the energy unit  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3)  and became
its controlling shareholder through an agreement to acquire as
much as 1.56 billion reais of shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
