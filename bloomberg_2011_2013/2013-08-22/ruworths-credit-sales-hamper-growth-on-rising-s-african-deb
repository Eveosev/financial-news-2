Truworths International Ltd. (TRU) ,  South
Africa ’s largest listed clothing retailer, reported full-year
earnings below estimates as more credit customers missed
payments.  Net income rose 8 percent to 2.4 billion rand ($233
million) in the 53 weeks through June 30, the Cape Town-based
company said in a statement today. That missed the 2.5 billion
rand median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
company raised the dividend 11 percent to 362 cents.  South African unsecured lending levels “are unlikely to
improve in the 2014 financial period and restrictive credit
granting criteria will limit account acquisition and credit
sales,” Truworths said. Credit sales, which account for 72
percent of total retail sales, grew 9 percent, the company said.  Truworths shares declined 1 percent to 82.60 rand by the
close in Johannesburg. The FTSE/JSE  Africa  General Retailers
Index fell 1.6 percent.  South African  retail sales  rose at the slowest pace in nine
months in June as rising  joblessness  weighed on spending. The
number of South Africans with impaired credit records rose by
189,000 to 9.53 million in the first quarter, the National
Credit Regulator said in June.  The Truworths statement comes two days after  Shoprite
Holdings Ltd. (SHP) , Africa’s largest retailer, said rising costs for
households would continue to damp  consumer spending .  To contact the reporter on this story:
