Tauron Polska Energia SA, Poland’s
second-biggest utility, posted a 39 percent drop in second-quarter profit after writing down the value of its coal-fired
power generating assets.  Net income  fell to 290 million zloty ($91 million) from 476
million zloty a year earlier, the Katowice, Poland-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today. That compares with the
281.6 million-zloty mean estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Tauron, which operates 4.78 gigawatts of power generating
units, said in July it would write down the value at 1.2
gigawatts of unprofitable coal-fired plants in the second
quarter.  Polish power prices  declined 16 percent this year as
the country’s economy expanded at the slowest pace in four years
in the first quarter.  The impact of the writedown on net income was about 190
million zloty and 240 million zloty on earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, the company
said today. Tauron also wrote down the value of its yellow and
red certificates, which companies get for heat and power
generation. That cut its operating profit by a further 42.3
million zloty.  Second-quarter Ebitda fell to 831 million zloty from 1.11
billion zloty, coming above analysts’ average estimate of 810.6
million zloty. Operating profit fell 42 percent to 400 million
zloty, exceeding the 373.9 million-zloty estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
