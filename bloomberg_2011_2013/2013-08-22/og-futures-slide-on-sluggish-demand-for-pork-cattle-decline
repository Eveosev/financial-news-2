Hog futures tumbled to the lowest in
more than a week on slowing overseas demand for U.S. pork amid
expanding supplies. Cattle prices also fell.  Export  sales  of pork totaled 7,064 metric tons (15.57
million pounds) in the week ended Aug. 15, down 17 percent from
a week earlier, Department of Agriculture data showed today.
Meatpackers processed 1.7 percent more hogs in the first three
days of this week than a week earlier. Wholesale  pork  dropped
2.2 percent to 99.57 cents a pound yesterday, the biggest loss
since July 10.  “The exports have really been sluggish,”  Dennis Smith , a
senior account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The hog numbers are
increasing, and slaughter has really expanded.”  Hog futures for October settlement dropped 0.9 percent to
85.025 cents a pound at 10:58 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching 84.95 cents, the lowest for the most-active contract since Aug. 12.  Cattle futures for October delivery declined 0.4 percent to
$1.274 a pound in Chicago.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement slid less
than 0.1 percent to $1.57625 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
