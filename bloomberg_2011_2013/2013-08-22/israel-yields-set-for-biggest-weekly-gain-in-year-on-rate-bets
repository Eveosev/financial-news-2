Israeli government bond yields
posted the steepest weekly increase in more than 12 months after
second-quarter economic growth beat forecasts, triggering bets
that the central bank won’t cut borrowing costs this year.  The yield on the 4 percent notes due January 2018 rose
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.62 percent at
the close in  Tel Aviv , taking the weekly gain to 32 basis
points. That’s the biggest such increase since the five days
ended Aug. 9, 2012. The yield on the central bank’s one-year
Makam bills climbed four basis points to 1.32 percent.  The nation’s economy expanded an annualized 5.1 percent in
the three months through June from a revised 2.7 percent in the
first quarter, the statistics bureau said Aug. 18. Policy makers
will leave borrowing costs unchanged when they meet next week,
according to all 19 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg. The  Bank of
Israel  held the benchmark  rate  at 1.25 percent at its last
meeting on July 29.  “This week’s good economic data removed bets that the
central bank will need to lower  interest rates  this year to
boost the economy,” said Ori Greenfeld, head of macroeconomic
research at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “The
change in expectations this week lifted shorter-term yields more
than longer-term yields.”  The central bank has gradually cut interest rates from 3.25
percent in 2011 to shore up the export-dependent economy amid
the  European debt crisis . Growth is forecast to expand 3.8
percent in 2014 from 3.6 percent this year, according to the
median estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the 4.25 percent benchmark securities due
March 2023 jumped five basis points to 4.03 percent, bringing
the five-day gain to 19 basis points. The shekel weakened 0.4
percent to 3.5904 a dollar at 5:40 p.m. in Tel Aviv, trimming
this year’s appreciation to 4 percent, the best performance
among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
