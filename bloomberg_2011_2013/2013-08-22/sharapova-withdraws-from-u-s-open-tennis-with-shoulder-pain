Maria Sharapova  withdrew from the
 U.S. Open  because of shoulder pain, robbing the last Grand Slam
tennis tournament of the year of its 2006 champion, who was
seeded third.  Sharapova, 26, had been limited to one match since July
because of a hip injury.  “Maria has informed us that she will be unable to compete
at the U.S. Open this year due to right shoulder bursitis,”
tournament director David Brewer said last night in a statement
e-mailed by the U.S. Tennis Association.  Sharapova, who has won each of the four Grand Slam
tournaments and has 29 titles on the Women’s Tennis Association
Tour along with almost $27 million in career winnings, fired
coach  Jimmy Connors  last week after one match together.  The Russian hired Connors, 60, an eight-time Grand Slam
champion, in mid-July after splitting with coach Thomas
Hogstedt. Sharapova lost to Sloane Stephens in her first match
in the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati last week.  American  Serena Williams , the defending champion, is the
top women’s seed at the U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 26 in New
York. Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland moves up to No. 3 following
Sharapova’s withdrawal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
