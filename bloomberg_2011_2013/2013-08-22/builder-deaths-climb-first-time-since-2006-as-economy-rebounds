Deaths among U.S. construction
workers climbed last year for the first time since before the
financial crisis amid a building rebound.  On-the-job fatalities in the private construction segment
rose 5 percent to 775 in 2012, from 738 a year earlier,
according to preliminary U.S. Department of Labor  data released
today . Workplace fatalities fell to 4,383 overall, from 4,693 in
2011, the department said.  New-home construction climbed to a 983,000  annual pace  in
December 2012 and the increase in U.S. building is drawing fresh
workers and some who haven’t been in the industry in years, said
Ron Sokol, who conducts safety training. The rate had been below
the December figure every month since 2008.  “The economy has picked up, and the sad thing about it is
that the risk associated with construction fatalities has
increased,” said Sokol, chief executive officer of the Safety
Council of  Texas City . “If people haven’t been doing it for a
while, you have to get yourself back in the game. Those hazards
don’t take a break.”  Many workers with the skills to build homes sought work
elsewhere during the recession and haven’t returned to
construction, the  National Association of Home Builders   said in
March . A shortage of workers has slowed construction and raised
costs, according to the industry group.  The  unemployment rate  was 7.8 percent at the end of 2012,
compared with 8.5 percent a year earlier. It’s since dropped to
7.4 percent.  Falls, Homicides  Fatal injuries in the construction sector are down 37
percent from 2006, the Department of Labor said. That’s been
driven in part by better safety equipment and improved
practices, according to Sokol.  Transportation  mishaps were the top cause of worker deaths
in 2012, accounting for more than 40 percent of the fatalities,
the data show. Homicides were linked to 11 percent of the
deaths. Falls, slips and trips were responsible for 15 percent.  About 11 percent of  workers killed  in 2012 were involved in
agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, led by farmers.
Truck transportation workers accounted for about 1 in 10
fatalities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
