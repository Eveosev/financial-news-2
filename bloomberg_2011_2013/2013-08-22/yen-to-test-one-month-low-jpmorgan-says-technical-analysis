The yen’s breach of a key trading
level opens the way for it to weaken to an almost one-month low
versus the dollar, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., citing
 technical analysis .  After weakening through support at 98.65 yesterday, the
Japanese currency will test 99.10 before falling to 99.97,
according to Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical analyst
at JPMorgan. That would be the lowest since July 25.  “The price action over the last few days has been
constructive and suggests that we can see a test of 99.10, if
not the 100 area,” O’Connor said in a telephone interview.
“There’s potential to extend in dollar-yen.”  Japan ’s currency declined 1.1 percent to 98.72 per dollar
yesterday in  New York  after earlier depreciating as much as 1.2
percent to 98.81, its weakest level since Aug. 5.  The yen’s current downtrend was confirmed after it failed
to strengthen through the area from 96.40 to 97 on Aug. 20,
according to O’Connor. It touched a seven-week high of 95.81 on
Aug. 8.  The Japanese currency has weakened 9 percent this year, the
worst performer after  Australia ’s dollar among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
