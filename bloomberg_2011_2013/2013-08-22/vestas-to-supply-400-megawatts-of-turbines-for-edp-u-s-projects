Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the Danish
turbine maker that’s been unprofitable for two years, will
supply 400 megawatts of turbines to EDP Renovaveis SA for
projects in the U.S.  The 2-megawatt turbines will be built in Colorado and
delivered beginning next year, according to a statement today
from Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas. Terms of the deal and details
about the projects weren’t disclosed.  It’s the Danish wind turbine maker’s first confirmed U.S.
order of the year and comes a day after Chief Marketing Officer
Morten Albaek said in an interview that he expects the American
market to pick up in the second half, with Vestas getting “our
fair share” of orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
