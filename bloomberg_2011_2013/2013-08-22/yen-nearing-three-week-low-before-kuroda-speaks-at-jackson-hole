The dollar declined against the euro
after purchases of new U.S. homes unexpectedly fell by the most
in more than three years in July.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index dropped for the first time
in three days after June’s new-home sales number was also
revised down. The greenback still rose this week after Federal
Open Market Committee minutes released showed most officials are
comfortable with a plan to start reducing bond purchases if the
economy improves. The  Canadian dollar  rebounded from a six-week
low versus the U.S. currency. The real surged after Brazil
announced an intervention program.  “Even though new-home sales data haven’t really been
stellar, I think what we need is for the data to actually turn
to the extent that shows the Fed was wrong,”said  Geoffrey Yu , a
senior currency strategist at UBS AG in  London . “We haven’t had
a critical mass of negative data yet to derail the Fed. It’s a
speed bump more than anything.”  The dollar declined 0.2 percent to $1.3383 per euro at 5
p.m. in New York after earlier gaining 0.2 percent. The yen was
little changed at 98.72 per dollar after touching 99.15, the
weakest level since Aug. 5.  Japan ’s currency dropped 0.2 percent
to 132.1 per euro, extended its weekly loss to 1.6 percent.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency
against a basket of its 10 major counterparts, fell 0.2 percent
to 1,026.15 after climbing 0.2 percent. It reached 1,031.37
yesterday, the highest level since Aug. 2, and gained 0.4
percent this week.  Real, Rupiah  Canada’s dollar  rose 0.2 percent to C$1.0496 after touching
C$1.0568, weakest intraday level since July 9, as a report
showed the country’s consumer price index rose less than the
central bank’s inflation target for a 15th month.  Brazil ’s currency gained after the central bank stepped up
efforts to arrest the world’s second-worst currency decline,
announcing a $60 billion intervention program involving currency
swaps and loans. The real jumped 3.6 percent to 2.3488 per U.S.
dollar.  Indonesia ’s rupiah rebounded from a four-year low after the
central bank announced measures to boost foreign-currency
supply. The rupiah gained 0.4 percent to 10,780 per dollar.  India’s rupee jumped 2 percent to 63.3300 per dollar to
pare a weekly drop to 2.7 percent as Asia’s No. 3 economy faces
risks from a current-account deficit that’s not sustainable,
slowing growth, a budget gap and rising bad loans at banks, the
Reserve Bank of  India  said.  South Africa’s currency gained, paring a second straight
weekly drop on signals from emerging-market nations that they
may support markets. The rand advanced 0.4 percent to 10.2438
per dollar.  Home Sales  The greenback fell as sales of newly built homes declined
13.4 percent to a 394,000 annualized pace, the weakest since
October, following a 455,000 rate in the prior period that was
lower than previously estimated, Commerce Department figures
showed in  Washington . The median estimate of 74 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a decrease to 487,000. Last
month’s decline was the biggest since May 2010.  Purchases of previously owned homes  jumped  in July to the
second-highest level in more than six years, data showed Aug.
21.  “New-home sales data was weak, but the existing-home sales
was very good -- there’s nothing that changes the FOMC general
picture that the housing market continues to recover,” Greg Anderson, head of global foreign exchange strategy at Bank of
Montreal, said by phone from New York. “Dollar-Canadian dollar,
dollar-yen certainly have shown a reversal of trends from the
past 48 hours, although it might have been ripe for Friday
afternoon profit-taking anyway.”  Euro Rally  The Fed’s debate over when to taper $85 billion in monthly
bond buying has roiled financial markets around the world and
sparked a selloff in fixed-income assets. The central bank is
buying $45 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage
bonds each month. U.S. policy makers next meet on Sept. 17-18.  The euro registered its biggest five-day rally against the
yen in five weeks after European Central Bank Governing Council
member Ewald Nowotny said good economic news removed the need
for further interest-rate cuts.  Euro-area  consumer confidence  increased more than
economists estimated in August, the European Commission in
Brussels said in a preliminary report today. An index of
household confidence in the 17-nation bloc improved for a ninth
month to minus 15.6, the highest level since July 2011, from
minus 17.4 in the previous month.  Options Trading  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $17 billion, compared with $24 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen exchange rate amounted to $3.7 billion, the
largest share of trades at 21 percent. Options on the euro-yen
rate totaled $1.5 billion, or 8.7 percent.  Greenback-yen options trading was 35 percent less than the
average for the past five Fridays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis, and euro-yen options trading
was 32 percent above average.  Traders reduced bets the yen will weaken, according to data
from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The difference in
the number of wagers by hedge funds and other large speculators
on a decline in the currency compared with those on a gain --
so-called  net shorts  -- was 71,721 on Aug. 20, compared with
74,462 a week earlier.  The dollar appreciated 4.8 percent this year, the best
performer after the euro among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
advanced 6.5 percent, while the yen slumped 9.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
