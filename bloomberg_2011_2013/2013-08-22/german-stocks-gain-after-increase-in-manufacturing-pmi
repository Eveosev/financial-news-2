German stocks  advanced, rebounding
after three days of losses, as data showed manufacturing in
Europe’s biggest economy expanded in August at a faster-than-expected pace.  Drillisch AG (DRI) , a provider of telephone services, surged 4.9
percent after Berenberg Bank upgraded the shares. Stroer Media
AG, a provider of online advertising, jumped 5.9 percent after
reporting an increase in first-half operating earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  climbed 1.2 percent to 8,381.31 at 10:07 a.m.
in Frankfurt. The gauge has  rallied 8.9 percent  from its low on
June 24 as the  European Central Bank  said that  interest rates 
will remain low for an extended period. The broader HDAX Index
added 1.1 percent today.  “The DAX futures opened down after a poor U.S. close last
night but better manufacturing PMIs from China and Germany
helped turn around the market,” Ion-Marc Valahu, co-founder and
 fund manager  at Clairinvest in Geneva, wrote in an e-mail.  Germany’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to
52 in August from 50.7 in July, according to a preliminary
report from Markit Economics. Economists had forecast a reading
of 51.1 for this month.  A gauge of Chinese manufacturing rose in August from an 11-month low. The preliminary reading of 50.1 for a  PMI Index (EC11FLAS) 
released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit compares with a
final figure of 47.7 in July. The number beat all 16 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey and was the first reading since April
above the 50 mark that divides contraction from expansion.  In the U.S., the Federal Open Market Committee’s minutes
from the July 30-31 gathering released yesterday showed
officials were “broadly comfortable” with Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke ’s plan to start reducing bond buying later this year if
the economy continues to improve, with several members saying
tapering might be needed soon.  A U.S. Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in Washington
will show initial claims for  unemployment benefits  rose to
330,000 last week from 320,000 in the preceding week, according
to the median estimate of  economists surveyed  by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
