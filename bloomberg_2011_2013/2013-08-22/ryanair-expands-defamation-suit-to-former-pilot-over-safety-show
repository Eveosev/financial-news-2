Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  filed a
defamation lawsuit in Dublin against a former pilot who appeared
on a U.K. television documentary that questioned the carrier’s
stance on safety.  The suit against John Goss is being brought over comments
made on the broadcast, which Ryanair said contradicted his
written statements that he had no safety concerns, Ryanair said
in a statement today on its website. The airline is seeking
“total vindication,” Paul Tweed, senior partner at law firm
Johnsons Solicitors, said in a statement.  Europe’s largest discount carrier dismissed Goss on Aug.
14, days after he appeared in the Channel 4 “ Dispatches ”
program that aired the safety concerns. The report relied on a
survey conducted by the Ryanair Pilots Group, which claims to
represent more than half of the carrier’s air crew.  Ryanair last week also sued Channel 4/Blakeway Productions,
Associated Newspapers, which publishes the  Daily Mail , and
Mirror Group, whose titles include the  Daily Mirror , as well as
the Belfast Telegraph in  Northern Ireland .  The Ryanair Pilot Group, of which Goss is a member, didn’t
immediately respond to written request for comment. The group
said last week after his dismissal that it supports Goss and
that Ryanair had chosen to “deny the existence of any problems
and to effectively shoot the messenger.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
