At Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., which operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, there are these things the company calls "systems issues" that crop up from time to time. The rest of the world calls them disasters. And today was a heck of an example, with the Nasdaq halting trading in stocks and options for much of the afternoon.  It's enough to make an investor want to short Nasdaq -- except that wasn't possible during the  trading halt , because Nasdaq's stock trades on the Nasdaq. Another  computer malfunction,  we're told. Or maybe a squirrel chewed through the wrong wire somewhere. Nobody knows what happened yet, and the fat-finger excuse doesnâ€™t work anymore.  We will probably get some massive, impenetrable white paper of a report from the regulators a year or so from now, like the Securities and Exchange Commission did after the so-called flash crash of May 2010. And it will have lists of recommendations that will be outdated by the time it comes out. By which point there are bound to be more debacles. It's miraculous that trading halts like the one today don't undermine investors' confidence more.  Don't say Nasdaq didn't warn anyone, though. Here's a cluster of some of the risk factors from Nasdaq's most recent  annual report . Note the first one, where the company said its systems issues were remedied after last year's fiasco when Facebook Inc. had its initial public offering. ****** ****** ****** ****** There's a reason those are called risk factors. They can happen, and today they did. They will happen again. (Jonathan Weil is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
