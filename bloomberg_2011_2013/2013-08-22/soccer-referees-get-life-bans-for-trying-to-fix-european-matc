Two Armenian soccer referees were
banned for life for trying to manipulate the outcome of a Europa
League match last month.  Referee Andranik Arsenyan and assistant Hovhannes Avagyan,
who officiated that match between Inter Turku and Víkingur, were
suspended by the disciplinary body of  UEFA , the sport’s regional
governing body. UEFA announced the bans in an e-mail.  The pair admitted to a hearing before the Football
Federation of  Armenia  that they tried to fix the outcome of the
second game between the clubs. Vikingur of the Faroe Islands
defeated Finland’s Inter Turku 2-1 over the two matches of the
Europa League first qualifying round.  UEFA’s betting fraud detection system found suspicious
activity around the match, and an investigation was started, the
governing body said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
