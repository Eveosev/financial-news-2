The Turkish lira weakened to a
record and stocks fell for a fourth day on concern the central
bank isn’t doing enough to help the currency and as Federal
Reserve minutes showed broad support for stimulus cuts.  The lira depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.9832 per dollar at
11:55 a.m. in Istanbul, poised for the lowest close since at
least 1981. The currency has slumped 10 percent this year, the
second-biggest drop among major emerging-market currencies in
 Europe , the  Middle East  and  Africa  after the South African rand.
The Borsa Istanbul National 100 index lost 1.9 percent to
68,358.33, bringing the slide for the week to 8 percent.  The central bank raised the overnight lending rate, which
comprises the upper end of its rates corridor, by 50 basis
points to 7.75 percent on Aug. 20, while keeping the benchmark
one-week repo rate unchanged at 4.5 percent. The prospect of
reduced U.S. stimulus and  Asia ’s faltering growth outlook fueled
a selloff of developing-nation stocks which have lost about $1
trillion this year. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell as much
as 1.2 percent.  “The central bank’s timidity in rates is what prepared the
scene for this,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a currency strategist at
Swissquote Bank SA in Geneva, said in e-mailed comments. “It
was a risk not to raise the benchmark rate when capital outflows
from  emerging markets  were at such an accelerated pace.”  Yields on two-year benchmark bonds  rose  seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 9.6 percent, the highest since May
last year.  The central bank, which has sold more than $7.5 billion for
liras since June 11 in an effort to control  currency
depreciation , said it will sell at least $350 million at 4:30
p.m. local time. The Ankara-based regulator declared today and
tomorrow “exceptional” days, meaning it provides funds to the
market at the overnight lending rate instead of the benchmark
one-week repo rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
