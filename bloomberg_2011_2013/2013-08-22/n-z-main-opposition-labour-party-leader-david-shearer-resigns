David Shearer, leader of  New
Zealand ’s main opposition Labour Party, stepped down today after
failing to boost the party’s poll ratings ahead of next year’s
general election.  Shearer, who assumed the leadership in December 2011,
announced his resignation at a press conference in Wellington.
“I realize I no longer enjoy the confidence of a number of my
caucus colleagues,” Shearer said in a statement. “So the time
has come for me to hand over to a new leader who can take Labour
through to 2014.”  Labour had 33 percent support in a Colmar Brunton poll of
1,006 voters for One News late last month, trailing the
governing  National Party , which was on 46 percent. Labour’s
support has dropped from a high of 36 percent in April. Shearer
scored 13 percent as preferred prime minister in the poll,
compared to 41 percent for National leader, Prime Minister John Key.  The  Labour Party  will now begin the process of electing a
new leader, which could take several weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
