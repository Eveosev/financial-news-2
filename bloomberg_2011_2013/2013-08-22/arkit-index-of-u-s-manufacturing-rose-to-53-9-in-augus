The Markit Economics  preliminary 
index of U.S. manufacturing increased to 53.9 in August from a
final reading of 53.7 a month earlier, the London-based group
said today.  The median  forecast  in a Bloomberg survey of 18 economists
called for a gain to 54.2. Estimates ranged from 53 to 55. A
reading greater than 50 for the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. Markit’s purchasers figure is based on
replies from 85 percent to 90 percent of those American
manufacturers who respond to a poll of the more than 600
companies.  Chinese manufacturing resumed expansion this month after
shrinking the most in almost a year in July and output at
European factories and services companies improved, other
reports today showed.  A preliminary purchasing managers index for  China  by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit rose to 50.1 from 47.7, exceeding all 16
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  In the euro area, the services index advanced to 51 in
August from 49.8 in July, Markit said. Economists forecast an
increase to 50.2, according to the median of 32 estimates. The
factory gauge indicated expansion for a second month, rising to
51.3 from 50.3. A composite index covering both industries
increased to 51.7 from 50.5.  The Markit gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May 2012,
and the company surveys purchasing managers in more than 30
countries and regions, which also include Europe and China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
