India ’s 10-year government bonds
advanced for a third day before the central bank’s purchase of
long-dated sovereign notes tomorrow.  The Reserve Bank of India will offer to buy as much as 80
billion rupees ($1.2 billion) of debt through an open-market
auction. The central bank announced the purchase on Aug. 20
after cash-supply curbs to support the rupee pushed 10-year bond
yields to a 12-year high. The rupee sank to a record low of
65.56 per dollar today.  “Investors are taking a wait and watch approach,” said
N.S. Venkatesh, head of treasury at  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  in Mumbai.
“Markets will take cues from the RBI’s open-market purchase
tomorrow.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent government bonds due May 2023
declined 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 8.24
percent in Mumbai, according to prices from the central bank’s
trading system.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, dropped 4 basis
points to 9.61 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
