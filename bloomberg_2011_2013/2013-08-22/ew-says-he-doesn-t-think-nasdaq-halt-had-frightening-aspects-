U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said he sees no reason to believe today’s  Nasdaq (CCMP)  Stock Market
trading halt had “any of the more frightening aspects to it,
but we’re going to have to learn all the facts.”  Lew, questioned about the shutdown by a moderator after a
speech today in  Mountain View ,  California , said he was “kept
informed through the day” and “we’ll all know more of the
details of exactly what caused today’s disruption.” The
Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq “have been
working all day on this,” he said.  Nasdaq, the second-biggest American exchange operator as
home to 3,200 companies from 37 countries, halted transactions
in all of its securities shortly after noon in  New York . The
decision caused buying and selling to stop on its platform and
dozens of others where the securities trade. Errors in the feed
used to disseminate quotes and prices were to blame,  Nasdaq  said
on its website.  The delay lasted for three hours and raised fresh concerns
about the fragility of exchanges.  “There are inherent risks in technology that if machines
break, or if a natural disaster occurs, or if there is some
malign activity, it could be very disruptive,” Lew said.
“Until there’s a full explanation of what happened today, I
want to leave the SEC and Nasdaq in a position to assemble the
facts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
