Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded on speculation that a higher pace of imports will
counter seasonally below-average production rates.  The spread, or price difference, swelled 0.33 cent to 64.5
cents a gallon at 10:52 a.m.  New York  time, a day after the
Energy Information Administration said  imports  have averaged
22,000 barrels a day this year through the week ended Aug. 16,
from 16,000 barrels a day during the same period a year earlier.
Output last week fell to a three-week low.  “Good import values over the next few months will help
replace some of that production,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst
at Linn Group in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 1.4 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.31 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 5.5 percent this year.  Gasoline for September delivery climbed 1.73 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.955 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  averaged 844,000 barrels a day last
week, the least since July 26 and 12 percent lower than the
record 963,000 in December 2011, data from the Energy
Department’s research division show.  The fuel is made mostly from corn in the U.S. Last summer’s
drought that wilted crops has tightened supply of the grain
until next month’s harvest.  Corn Prices  Corn for September delivery dropped 3.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $4.9425 a bushel in Chicago. The more actively
traded December contract slumped 10.5 cents to $4.7275.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts, was 50 cents, up from 49 cents yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol is derived from sugarcane in  Brazil . Anhydrous
ethanol in  Sao Paolo  cost $1.98 a gallon in the week ended Aug.
16, the lowest since May 7, 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  The government uses tracking certificates, known as
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, to determine
compliance with mandates to use the fuel.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  fell 2 cents to 73 cents while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, slipped 1 cent to 81 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
