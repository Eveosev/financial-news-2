The naira fell the most in a month
against the dollar, snapping two days of gains, on speculation
that sales of the U.S. currency by companies in West  Africa ’s
biggest economy eased.  The currency of Africa’s biggest crude producer retreated
0.3 percent, the most since July 23 on a closing basis, to
161.70 per dollar by 3:03 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital.
The naira has declined 3.4 percent against the dollar this year.  Oil companies, which sell the U.S. currency mainly at the
month’s end to pay domestic expenses, are the second-biggest
supplier of dollars after the Central Bank of Nigeria. The
Abuja-based institution auctions foreign exchange on Mondays and
Wednesdays. It  sold  $548.4 million this week from $521.6 million
in the previous five days.  “We’ve not seen significant flows from the oil majors,”
Abiola Rasaq, head of research at UBA Capital, said by phone
today from Lagos. “This is a period when oil companies should
be selling dollars to fund their naira obligations.”  The central bank occasionally sells dollars directly to
lenders on the interbank market outside of its weekly auctions.
While buyers had been getting more of these offers in recent
months, “we’ve not seen so much of that over the last two to
three weeks,” Rasaq said.  Borrowing costs on Nigeria’s domestic bonds due January
2022 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 13.58
percent, according to yesterday’s data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.2 percent to 2.1500 per dollar in
Accra, the lowest on a closing basis since at least May 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
