At least three rockets struck open
areas in northern  Israel  today just south of the border with
Lebanon, causing no injuries or damage, police spokeswoman Luba
Samri said by phone.  A fourth rocket was intercepted in flight by the Iron Dome
missile defense system, Israel’s Channel 2 TV reported. An
Israeli army spokeswoman had no immediate details on the attack
and said she was unaware of any Israeli military response.  Al Arabiya TV reported Israeli aritllery fire toward
Lebanon.  Four rockets were fired from the Lebanese city of Tyre,
Lebanon’s official National News Agency said.  Rockets last struck Israel from Lebanon in November 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
