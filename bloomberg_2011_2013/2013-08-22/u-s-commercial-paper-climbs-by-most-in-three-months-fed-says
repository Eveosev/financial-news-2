The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  jumped the most in three months, led by
issuance from non-financial companies.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
rose $16.7 billion to $1.02 trillion in the week ended
yesterday, the third straight increase, the  Federal Reserve  said
today on its website. That’s the biggest jump since the period
ended May 22 and the highest level since the market touched
$1.035 trillion in the week ended July 3.  IOUs issued by non-financial companies  rose  for the first
time in four weeks, climbing $16.6 billion to $210.8 billion
outstanding, the Fed said.  “Non-financial commercial paper issuance has been driven
by trends in short-term corporate bond yields; as yields rise,
borrowers have shifted back into the CP market,”  Howard Simons ,
strategist at Bianco Research LLC in  Chicago , wrote in an e-mail.  U.S. corporate bond yields have risen 30 basis points
during the past month to 4.24 percent yesterday and up from a
record-low 3.35 percent on May 2, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Companies can obtain funds more
cheaply in the commercial paper market, where  30-day rates  for
top-ranked paper are 0.1 percent, at about the lowest in data
compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1996.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
