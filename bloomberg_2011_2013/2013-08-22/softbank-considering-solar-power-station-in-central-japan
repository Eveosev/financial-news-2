SoftBank Corp. (9984) , the Japanese carrier
that acquired  Sprint Corp. (S)  for $21.6 billion, is considering
building a solar power station in central Japan, a company
spokesman said.  Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, is among locations
being considered for the plant and the company is holding talks
with landowners, Kenichi Yuasa, a spokesman Tokyo-based
SoftBank, said by phone today, adding that it is too soon to
discuss details.  Construction of the 40 megawatt plant may start in June,
the Kyodo news agency reported earlier today.  SoftBank has six operating solar stations across Japan,
according to the website of its clean energy unit SB Energy
Corp. An additional station will start operations tomorrow, SB
Energy said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
