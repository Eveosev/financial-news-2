Barry Cheung , the chairman and
largest shareholder of Hong Kong’s failed commodities exchange
that is being investigated by police, said it had received false
financial documents.  “We have been victims in all of this,” Cheung said by
phone today. “We were provided with documents we did not know
were false.”  Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange surrendered its trading
license in May after failing to attract sufficient revenue to
support its operations and police have arrested nine and charged
four in connection with the case. Ong Shen Kuo, who sent Cheung
a false proof of funds for $516 million, was a middle man who
didn’t know it was fake, his lawyer told a Hong Kong magistrates
court.  Ong sent the document in hopes of helping to broker a
fundraising deal on behalf of Cheung, Ong’s lawyer Kevin Egan
said today.  Cheung, who resigned in May from all his public service
positions including Hong Kong’s executive council, declined to
comment on the specific case involving Ong.  “It’s unfortunate that every time this is mentioned we get
dragged in,” he said. “We had nothing to do with it other than
being provided with the false documents.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
