Two sour oils produced in the  Gulf
of Mexico  weakened against domestic benchmark West Texas
Intermediate on speculation that Motiva Enterprises LLC’s
Convent refinery in Louisiana may shut a unit for a month
following a fire.  The premiums for Eugene Island crude and Bonito Sour, which
are delivered in St. James, Louisiana near Convent, narrowed 50
cents to 50 cents over WTI at 2:53 p.m. in New York, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Sours obviously are coming down because we think Motiva’s
going to pull back,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks
& Opinions LLC in Houston.  The two sours are delivered through  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
pipelines. Shell is a joint owner of the Convent refinery, as
well as the Motiva Port Arthur refinery in  Texas , which also had
a unit down.  The premium of Light Louisiana Sweet gained 10 cents on WTI
to $3.50 a barrel, and the premium for Heavy Louisiana Sweet
over WTI grew 5 cents to $3.25 a barrel.  Poseidon strengthened against WTI, narrowing its discount
55 cents to $3 a barrel, and Mars Blend strengthened 40 cents,
to a $2 a barrel discount to WTI. Southern Green Canyon rose 50
cents a barrel to a $2.90 discount.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, rose 25
cents a barrel to $1.25 over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
