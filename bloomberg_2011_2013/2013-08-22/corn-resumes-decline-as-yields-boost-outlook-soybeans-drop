Corn dropped for the second time in
three days as field samples taken on farms in  Illinois  bolstered
optimism the U.S. harvest will rebound from last year’s drought
and reach a record. Soybeans dropped from a two-month high.  Corn for December delivery lost as much as 1 percent to
$4.7825 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $4.80
by 10:26 a.m. in  Singapore . Prices advanced 1.6 percent
yesterday after a 2.1 percent drop on Aug. 20.  Yields in Illinois may climb 40 percent from last year to
an average of 170.5 bushels an acre, according to participants
in the annual Professional Farmers of America Midwest Crop Tour.
Prices have slumped 31 percent this year as the U.S. Department
of Agriculture projects a record 13.26 billion-bushel national
harvest.  “The Pro Farmer crop tour through the U.S. Midwest is
providing a focus for the market,”  Profarmer   Australia , a unit
of NZX Ltd., said in a report dated yesterday. “The U.S. corn
crop will bolster ending stocks considerably even if weather
stays hot and dry into the harvest.”  Soybeans for November delivery dropped as much as 0.9
percent to $12.925 a bushel before trading at $12.96. Prices
rose to $13.19 yesterday, matching the highest level on June 19.
Wheat for delivery in December was unchanged at $6.4925 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
