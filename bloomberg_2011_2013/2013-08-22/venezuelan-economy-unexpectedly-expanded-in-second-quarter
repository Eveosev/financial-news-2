Venezuelan economy unexpectedly
expanded in the second quarter, as strong manufacturing growth
offset slowing construction.  Gross domestic product grew 2.6 percent from the year
earlier, compared with the median estimate of eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg for a contraction of 0.8 percent.  Growth was driven by the oil sector, manufacturing and
financial services, central bank president Eudomar Tovar said on
state television today. Manufacturing expanded 5.7 percent in
the second quarter from a year earlier, he said. Manufacturing
accounts for the biggest share of  Venezuela ’s gross domestic
product under the central bank’s methodology.  The economy expanded 0.7 percent in the first quarter. Six
out of eight economists in the survey had predicted a
contraction in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
