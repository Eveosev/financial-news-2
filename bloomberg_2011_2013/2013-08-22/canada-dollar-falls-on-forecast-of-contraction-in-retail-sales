Canada ’s dollar dropped to its
lowest level in more than six weeks as a report showed consumer
prices advanced less than the central bank’s inflation target in
July for a 15th month.  The currency fell for a sixth day, the longest slump in two
months, after weakening yesterday as a report showed retail
sales shrank more than forecast in June. The consumer price
index increased 1.3 percent from a year earlier, less than the
1.4 percent gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The central
bank’s target is 2 percent. The government issues data on gross
domestic product Aug. 30.  “The lower Canadian dollar is a reflection of the theme
we’ve seen throughout the week, which is weaker data across the
board,”  David Tulk , chief macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion
Bank’s TD Securities unit, said by phone from Toronto.  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is nicknamed for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.3 percent to
C$1.0548 per U.S. dollar at 9:02 a.m. in Toronto. It touched
C$1.0570, the weakest intraday level since July 9. One Canadian
dollar purchases 94.81 U.S. cents.  Canadian government bonds were little changed, with the
benchmark  10-year (GCAN10YR)  security yielding 2.75 percent after climbing
yesterday to a two-year high of 2.78 percent.  Oil, Canada’s biggest export, headed for a weekly slide,
trading at $105.13 a barrel in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
