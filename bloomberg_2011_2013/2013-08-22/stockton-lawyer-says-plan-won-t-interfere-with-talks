Representatives of Stockton,
 California , met with creditors and a mediator today in an effort
to win support for a proposal it will file in court next month
to cut debt and exit bankruptcy, the city’s lead attorney said.  That proposal would be a so-called cramdown plan, Marc A. Levinson, the attorney for Stockton, said in an e-mail today.
That means the plan lacks widespread support among creditors. By
meeting with the mediator, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Elizabeth Perris of  Oregon , the city could reach a deal with some
creditors before the plan is submitted, Levinson said.  “The goal is to change it to a consensual plan before it
is filed,” Levinson said he told the federal judge overseeing
Stockton’s bankruptcy yesterday. “That, of course, depends on
whether the mediation results in deals.”  Stockton, an agricultural center of 296,000 about 80 miles
(130 kilometers) east of  San Francisco , is among four
municipalities that have said they will ask creditors including
bondholders to take less than the principal they are owed. The
others are Detroit, San Bernardino, California, and Jefferson
County,  Alabama .  Should Stockton file a cramdown plan, it can still try to
negotiate a settlement, Levinson said.  Perris, the mediator, is also part of a team assigned to
mediate disputes between Detroit and its creditors.  The case is In re Stockton, 12-bk-32118,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Eastern District of California ( Sacramento ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
