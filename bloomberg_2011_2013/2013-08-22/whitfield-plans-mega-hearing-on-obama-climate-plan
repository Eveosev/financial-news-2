House Republicans  are seeking 13
federal agencies representing basically every federal decision-maker on the issue to testify at a massive hearing on the White
House’s climate change agenda.  The Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee on Energy and Power 
said today that invitations to testify are going to the EPA, the
Energy Department, Health and Human Services Department,
Agriculture Department, Interior Department, Transportation
Department, Defense Department, State Department, USAID, the
Export-Import Bank, Office of Science and Technology, NOAA and
 NASA .  Subcommittee Chairman Ed Whitfield, a Kentucky Republican
from a coal-reliant district,  said  June 25 that the White
House’s climate plan “seeks to limit our nation’s fuel choices
and make coal-fired electricity generation in this country
extinct.”  The hearing is scheduled for Sept. 18.  Still to be determined: How they’ll fit everyone with a
stake in anything to do with climate policy and its associated
rules and regulations across 13 departments and agencies into
2123 Rayburn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
