Activist investor  Edward Bramson 
stepped down as chairman of British money manager  F&C Asset
Management Plc (FCAM) , two-and-a-half years after ousting his
predecessor.  Bramson, F&C’s largest shareholder through his fund
Sherborne Investors LLC, will be replaced by Kieran Poynter, a
non-executive director since June 2009 and chairman of Nomura
Holdings Inc.’s international unit, London-based F&C said in a
statement today.  Bramson, 62, replaced Nick MacAndrew as chairman in
February 2011 after criticizing the company’s costs, levels of
debt and acquisitions. He then sought to boost the fund
manager’s performance by cutting costs and focusing on the
firm’s traditional business areas such as  investment trusts  and
managing fixed-income assets for insurers.  The stock has risen about 23 percent in London trading
since Bramson took over. F&C last month posted a first-half
profit, compared with a loss in the year-earlier period. He
started building a stake in 3i Group Plc, Britain’s oldest
private-equity firm, in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
