Mexico ’s inflation-linked bonds
rose, pushing yields to the lowest level in a year, after a
report showed consumer prices increased more than forecast in
the first half of August.  Yields on inflation-linked debt maturing in June 2016 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.51 percent at
9:53 a.m. in Mexico City, the lowest level on a closing basis
since July 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Mexico’s peso appreciated 0.8 percent to 13.1512 per dollar
after falling yesterday to the lowest in almost two months.  Inflation-linked bonds rose today after the national
statistics agency reported that consumer prices climbed 0.26
percent in the first half of August, compared with the 0.16
percent  median forecast  of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Annual inflation accelerated to 3.54 percent, higher than the
midpoint of the central bank’s target range of 2 to 4 percent.  “The inflation data will definitively support a decline in
yields on the short end of the curve,” Gerardo Welsh, the head
of money markets at Banco Base SA, wrote in an e-mailed response
to questions. “We think the short end of the curve, debt
maturing in 2013, 2014 and 2016, is very tied to future monetary
policy.”  The central bank held its  target lending rate  at a record
low 4 percent July 12 as policy makers tried to balance slowing
economic growth with above-target inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
