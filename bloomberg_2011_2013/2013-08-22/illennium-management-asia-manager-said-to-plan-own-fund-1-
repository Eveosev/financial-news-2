Guo Feng, a Hong Kong-based
portfolio manager at  Millennium Management LLC , the $18.6
billion hedge fund run by Israel Englander, is preparing to
start his own firm, said two people with knowledge of the talks.  Guo, 32, will open Hong Kong-based Symmetry Investment
Management with initial capital from Millennium or Englander,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
plans are both private and at an early stage.  Guo’s team, based in  Hong Kong  and  London , manages about
$1.2 billion of fixed-income and rates investments for
Millennium, the people said. While his planned fund will
continue to employ the strategy, it may later invest in other
asset classes, the people said.  Tripp Kyle, a spokesman at New York-based Millennium,
declined to comment on Feng’s plans. Guo declined to comment.
Reuters reported Guo’s plans earlier.  Michael Robinson , Millennium’s regional manager for Asia,
has been leading talks with investors about the fund, the people
said. It’s not yet clear whether he will join Guo, they added.
Robinson didn’t answer a call to his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
