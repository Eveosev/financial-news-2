Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  reached its
highest in two years after the dental implant maker’s second-quarter sales beat analysts’ estimates as its European business
grew for the first time in six years.  Nobel rose 15 percent to close at 14.75 Swiss francs at
5:30 p.m. in Zurich, giving the Glattbrugg, Switzerland-based
company a market value of 1.83 billion francs ($1.98 billion).
The share price rise is the biggest since Jan. 27, 2000.  The world’s second-largest dental-implant maker is trying
to regain ground lost to bigger Swiss rival  Straumann Holding AG (STMN) 
and is investing in product development and the expansion of its
value implant business called Alpha-Bio Tec.  The 3.2 percent growth for Nobel’s implant business is
“one of the strongest results across the dental-implant
industry this quarter, and is encouraging after several years of
decline,” Lisa Clive, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
Ltd., wrote in a note to investors today.  Sales for the quarter rose 2.3 percent at constant exchange
rates to 147.8 million euros ($196.8 million), the company said
in a  statement  today, beating the 144.5 million-euro average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income declined
to 8 million euros from 13.7 million a year earlier, matching
the Bloomberg average estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
