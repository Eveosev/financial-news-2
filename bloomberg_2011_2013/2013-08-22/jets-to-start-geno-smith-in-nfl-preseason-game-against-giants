Rookie quarterback Geno Smith’s
first start for the New York Jets will come against the  New York
Giants .  Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said at a news conference today that
Smith, the team’s second-round pick in this year’s National
Football League draft, will start the Aug. 24 preseason game
against the Giants.  Mark Sanchez , who started at quarterback for
the Jets’ first two exhibition games, will also play, Ryan said.  There’s been no decision on who will be the Jets’ starting
quarterback for the regular-season opener on Sept. 8 against the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Ryan said.  “We’ve said that this is going to be a fair and even
competition,” Ryan was quoted as saying on the  team’s website .
“I understand the interest in that position, but right now is
not the time to name a starter for the season. We’ll see what
happens after this game.”  Smith, 22, sat out last week’s preseason game against the
Jacksonville Jaguars after injuring his ankle the previous week
against the Detroit Lions. Smith played quarterback for three
full series and the start of a fourth against the Lions before
getting hurt, completing 6 of 7 passes for 47 yards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
