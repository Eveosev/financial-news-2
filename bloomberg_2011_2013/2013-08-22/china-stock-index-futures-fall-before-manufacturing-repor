China’s  stocks  fell to a two-week
low as concern the  Federal Reserve  will pare stimulus
overshadowed a better-than-estimated manufacturing report.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel  Rare-Earth  Hi-Tech Co. and
Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. led declines for material and energy
companies with losses of at least 2.1 percent. Yunnan Baiyao
Group Co., a traditional Chinese medicine company, soared 5.7
percent after first-half profit rose 30 percent.  ZTE Corp. (000063) 
advanced 1 percent after its net income jumped 27 percent.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 0.3 percent to
2,067.12 at the close. The preliminary reading of 50.1 for a
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics compares with the 48.2 median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. Fed minutes showed officials were
“broadly comfortable” with Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to
start reducing bond buying this year.  “Today’s flash PMI once again shows the economy is
continuing to stabilize,” Zhang Haidong, an analyst at Tebon
Securities Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “However, we may
see resistance at around 2,100. With good data, the central bank
will not feel pressure to loosen its policy. Concerns about Fed
tapering will further exacerbate outflows of funds from China.”  The CSI 300 Index dropped 0.2 percent to 2,303.93, while
the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  advanced 0.3 percent. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index fell 0.8 percent in  New York 
yesterday.  Flash PMI  The Shanghai index has declined 8.9 percent this year,
dragging down its projected 12-month profit to 8.3 times,
compared with the three-year average of 10.4. Trading volumes in
the index were 11 percent below the 30-day average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The preliminary factory reading compares with a final
figure of 47.7 in July. A number above 50 indicates an
expansion. The report is based on about 85 percent to 90 percent
of responses to surveys sent to more than 420 manufacturers. The
final reading will be released on Sept. 2.  “A nice big surprise to the markets,” Ting Lu,  China 
economist at Bank of America Corp., wrote in a note to clients.
The report “will add evidence to the recovery (or at least
stability) in China.”  U.S. policy makers will probably pare their $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases at the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s
Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of 48 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg Aug. 9-13.  “If you do see the Fed begin to slow its bond purchasing,
it will be negative for money flows out of the  emerging
markets ,” Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at Oberweis Asset
Management Inc., which manages $700 million of assets, said by
phone yesterday from Lisle,  Illinois . “Some of the Chinese
names may sell off after strong rallies.”  Rare Earth  Baotou Steel slid 3 percent to 29.20  yuan . The rare earth
producer reported a 33 percent drop in first-half profit last
week. A gauge of material companies in the CSI 300 fell 1
percent, the most among 10 industry groups. Yanzhou Coal Mining
declined 2.1 percent to lead losses for energy companies.  Everbright Securities Co. (601788)  dropped 2.8 percent to 9.98 yuan
for a three-day loss of 18 percent. The shares were suspended in
the afternoon after Xu Haoming resigned as president of the
brokerage.  Everbright roiled Chinese stock markets last week with
erroneous buy orders. The China Securities Regulatory Commission
will examine risks from brokerages’ trading system to prevent
trading errors from happening again, according to a statement
posted on the CSRC’s website yesterday.  Drug Shares  A gauge of drug companies in the CSI 300 rose 1.5 percent,
the most among the industry groups. Yunnan Baiyao surged 5.7
percent to 107.30 yuan. The company’s first-half profit jumped
to 936.6 million yuan, while revenue rose 19 percent to 7.31
billion yuan from a year ago, according to a statement posted on
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.  ZTE gained 1 percent to 17.03 yuan. The company’s first-half net income climbed to 310 million yuan. It expects to post
net income of up to 440 million yuan in the third quarter,
compared with a net loss in the same period a year ago.  Former Politburo member  Bo Xilai  took bribes worth 21.8
million yuan ($3.6 million), some via his wife and son Bo
Guagua, according to charges read out in court in China’s most
politically charged case in three decades.  The bribery claims were the first in a list of allegations
against Bo, a former commerce minister and Chongqing party
secretary, whose trial has followed a pattern in which Chinese
political defendants are turned over to the courts only after
they’re purged by party leaders.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
