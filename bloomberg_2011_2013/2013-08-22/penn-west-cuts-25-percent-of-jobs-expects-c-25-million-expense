Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (PWT)  Chief
Executive Officer David Roberts, who took over the Canadian oil
producer in June, has cut 550 jobs, or 25 percent of the
company’s workforce, this year.  Penn West, based in Calgary, expects to record a C$25
million ($23.8 million) expense related to the job cuts in the
third quarter of 2013, the company said in a statement today.  “While I now believe we are staffed at an appropriate
level to efficiently move the company forward, our processes and
actions must continue to drive cost improvements to our bottom
line so our shareholders can measure the progress we are
making,” Roberts said in the statement.  When Penn West appointed Roberts to replace Murray Nunns in
June, it said the company would cut costs and review
alternatives.  Penn West made the announcement after the close of regular
trading on North American markets. The shares rose 1.2 percent
to C$11.92 at the close in Toronto. Penn West has gained 10.4
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
