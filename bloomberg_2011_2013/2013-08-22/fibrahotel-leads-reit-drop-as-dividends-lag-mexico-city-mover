Concentradora Fibra Mexicana
Hotelera SA (FIHO12)  led a retreat of Mexican real-estate trusts on
concern higher  interest rates  will diminish their appeal as
income-producing investments while boosting financing costs.  FibraHotel, as the lodging company is known, fell 3.9
percent to 21.21 pesos at 2:35 p.m. in Mexico City, the biggest
drop since its initial public offering in November.  Fibra Uno
Administracion SA (FUNO11) , Mexico’s first and biggest real estate
investment trust, fell 1.6 percent to 37.58 pesos. The country’s
benchmark IPC index declined 1 percent.  Mexican real-estate trusts, known as Fibras, had become the
fastest-growing asset class in the Latin American nation as
investors sought access to the  property market . Demand waned as
surging government bond yields made the Fibras’ dividends less
attractive, according to Marco Medina, an analyst at Grupo
Financiero Ve Por Mas SA.  “The correction we’ve seen in these issuers has to do in a
big way with the performance of rates,” Medina said in a
telephone interview from  Mexico  City.  Yields on the Mexican government’s 10-year bonds
denominated in pesos reached a 19-month high of 6.37 percent
this week. At current market prices, Fibra Uno offers a 12-month
dividend yield of about 4.3 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Two other Fibras declined. Asesor de Activos Prisma SAPI
decreased 2.1 percent to 17.40 pesos while Mexico Real Estate
Management SA fell 0.6 percent to 22.65 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
