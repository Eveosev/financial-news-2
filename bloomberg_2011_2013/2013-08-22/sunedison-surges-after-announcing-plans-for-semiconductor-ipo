SunEdison Inc. (SUNE) , the polysilicon
supplier formerly known as MEMC Electronic Materials Inc.,
surged the most in a seven weeks after announcing plans to
separate its semiconductor operations in an initial public
offering to fund the development of solar farms and pay down
debt.  SunEdison gained 16 percent to $7.88 at the close in New
York, the most since July 2.  SunEdison will sell a minority stake in its semiconductor
business through the IPO, the St. Peters, Missouri-based company
said today in a statement. The venture will be named SunEdison
Semiconductor Inc. and operate independently with its own board
of directors.  “Longer term, they see greater growth potential out of the
solar business, and they need capital to fund that,” Angelo Zino, an analyst at  Standard & Poor’s  in New York, said in an
interview. “If you look at where they’ve been pushing their
efforts, it’s been on the solar side, and that business has
grown to the point where it’s very difficult to manage both
semiconductors and solar. Spinning that business off makes a lot
of sense.”  The IPO is expected by early next year, according to the
statement. The percentage of the new business that SunEdison
plans to sell hasn’t been determined.  “Two years ago there were more synergies between
semiconductors and solar,” said Zino, who upgraded SunEdison
shares to a strong buy today. “This unlocks a lot of value for
investors, because a lot weren’t fully appreciating that
semiconductor business, which is about a third of their
revenue.”  SunEdison is the largest U.S. supplier of polysilicon
wafers for semiconductors and solar cells after Hemlock
Semiconductor Corp. It was known as MEMC until May. MEMC
acquired the solar developer SunEdison LLC in October 2009 for
$200 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
