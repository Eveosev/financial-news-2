Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG) , Australia’s
largest electricity retailer, obtained A$7.4 billion ($6.6
billion) in bank loans to refinance debt and bolster funding
after its liquefied natural gas project begins.  The interest cost is consistent with its existing bank
debt, Sydney-based Origin said today in a statement as it posted
a 15 percent drop in full-year underlying profit.  Origin needs about A$4.1 billion to fund its share of the
LNG venture with  ConocoPhillips (COP)  in Queensland through first
production in 2015, according to a separate statement. The new
loan is underwritten by  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ) , Bank of America Corp. Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG.  The A$24.7 billion  Australia  Pacific LNG project is about
45 percent complete and is on schedule to deliver first LNG by
mid-2015, Origin said today. The venture is one of seven
Australian LNG projects being built to meet Asian demand.  Origin gained 1.6 percent to A$12.47 at 10:12 a.m. in
Sydney, taking its advance for the year to 7.2 percent.  Origin is fully funded for the LNG venture, it said. The
company will fund its share of the Queensland project with cash
and existing debt facilities, the company said.  Origin’s underlying profit dropped to A$760 million in the
12 months ended June 30, from A$893 million a year earlier, the
company said. That compares with the A$753.6 million average
estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Net income
dropped 61 percent to A$378 million, Origin said.  Origin in February reported a 7 percent cost increase at
the LNG project and cut its forecast for annual profit for the
second time in three months, estimating underlying earnings
would be 10 percent to 15 percent below the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
