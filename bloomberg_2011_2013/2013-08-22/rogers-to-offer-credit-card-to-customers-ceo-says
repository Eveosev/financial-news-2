Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) , Canada’s
largest wireless operator, will introduce a credit card for its
customers “shortly,” Chief Executive Officer Nadir Mohamed
said in an interview.  “It is very much a  loyalty program  that we have in mind,”
Mohamed, 57, said today during an interview at Bloomberg News’
Toronto office. “We know from looking at other industries that
the credit-card business in itself is a growth opportunity for
the company.”  Rogers received approval from Canada’s Ministry of Finance
May 3 to operate as a bank, a step required to becoming a
credit-card issuer. The firm, based in Toronto, applied in
September 2011 for a bank license, primarily to focus on card
services.  Mohamed wouldn’t say if Rogers would collaborate with
another bank on its card offering, which is still going through
the regulatory process.  “You will see everything unfold as we’re ready to make
announcements,” he said, adding that the time would be
“shortly.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
