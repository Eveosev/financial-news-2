Software patents are the biggest
reason behind a rise in litigation over inventions, especially
against companies that use the technology, the U.S. Government
Accountability Office found.  Its  study , required under a law passed in 2011 that
overhauled the U.S. patent system, said the revisions and court
rulings have made it easier to invalidate questionable patents
and limited damages that can be collected on a minor feature.
The report recommended the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office do
more to improve the review process.  The GAO found almost half, or 46 percent, of lawsuits filed
from 2007 to 2011 involved software-related patents, and more
than a third of those, or 39 percent, were against companies
outside technology fields. Those included retailers and
drugmakers who were sued over features on their websites.
Companies told the agency that it’s often difficult to determine
what the patents cover.  “Although there is some inherent uncertainty associated
with all patent claims, several of the stakeholders with this
opinion noted that claims in software-related patents are often
overly broad, unclear or both,” according to the report.  Companies whose main business is to extract royalty
revenue, called patent monetization entities or PMEs, filed
about 19 percent of all lawsuits from 2007 to 2011, while
operating companies brought 68 percent, the study found.  The number of defendants sued by patent monetization
entities more than tripled, to 3,401 in 2011 from 834 in 2007,
