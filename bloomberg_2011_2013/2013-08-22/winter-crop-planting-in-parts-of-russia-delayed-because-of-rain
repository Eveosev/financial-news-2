Rain in parts of  Russia  delayed
planting of winter crops for the 2014-15 season that starts July
1, the state weather center said.  Rain in the Volga and Central federal districts on Aug. 11
to Aug. 20 disrupted field work, it  said  on its website. They
accounted for about 46 percent of the national crop last year,
according to government data.  Conditions will be “mainly
good” in the last 10 days of August, the forecaster said.  Russia expects farmers to plant more than 16 million
hectares (39.5 million acres) of winter grain. Last year, they
planted 15.8 million hectares and the harvest was collected from
14.7 million hectares, Agriculture Ministry data show.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
