Palm advanced to the highest level
in almost six weeks after data showed  China ’s manufacturing
increased, fueled by domestic demand, and as a weaker Malaysian
currency boosted the appeal of the ringgit-denominated futures.  The contract for November delivery climbed as much as 0.5
percent to 2,347 ringgit ($707) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest for the most-active contract
since July 12, and was at 2,338 ringgit at 12:03 p.m. in  Kuala
Lumpur .  Palm oil  for physical delivery in September was at 2,395
ringgit yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  preliminary  reading of 50.1 for the Chinese Purchasing
Managers’ Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compares with a final figure of 47.7 in July and the
48.2 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. A number above 50
indicates an expansion. Malaysia’s palm oil exports to China,
the largest buyer after India, rose 49 percent in the first 20
days of August from the same period last month, an estimate from
surveyor SGS (Malaysia) Sdn. show.  China is “likely to boost palm oil demand with stronger
economic data,” Sim Han Qiang, an analyst with Phillip Futures
Pte in Singapore, wrote in a report today.  Refined palm oil for January delivery was little changed at
5,536  yuan  ($904) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
 Soybean oil  was also little changed at 7,122 yuan a ton.  The Malaysian currency touched 3.3228 per dollar today, the
weakest level since June 2010, after minutes from a U.S. Federal
Reserve meeting in July showed policy makers back Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke ’s plan to reduce stimulus.  “The weaker ringgit makes palm oil slightly more
attractive in terms of pricing to price-sensitive customers like
India or Pakistan,” Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance
Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone in Kuala Lumpur.  Soybean oil for delivery in December fell 0.3 percent to
43.05 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November delivery lost 0.5 percent to $12.97 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
