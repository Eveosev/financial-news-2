Foreign jihadists are flocking to
 Syria  in increasing numbers to fight President Bashar al-Assad’s
forces, turning the country into a hub for global terrorism, a
spokesman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry said.  Between 6,000 and 40,000 foreign fighters may be in Syria,
Alexander Lukashevich told reporters today in Moscow, declining
to say how many are Russian nationals.  “The flow of foreign mercenaries is comparable with the
peak levels seen in  Iraq  in 2005-2007,” he said. “Despite all
their efforts, illegal militant groups can’t turn the tide.”  Syria’s civil war, which began with peaceful protests in
March 2011, has engulfed the nation and brought economic growth
to a halt. U.S. military intelligence said last month that the
civil war will probably continue for years as the country faces
the prospect of “unfathomable violence” and growing power for
Islamic radicals, including those allied with al-Qaeda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
