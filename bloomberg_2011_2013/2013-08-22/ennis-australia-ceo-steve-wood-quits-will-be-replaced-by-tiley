Tennis Australia  said Chief
Executive Officer Steve Wood will resign at the end of next
month and will be replaced by Australian Open tournament
director Craig Tiley.  The 51-year-old Wood, a professional player during the mid
1980s, said in a Tennis Australia statement today that he had
decided to “take a break” and planned to “make a contribution
to the game from a different perspective in the future.”  During Wood’s eight-year tenure, the Melbourne-based
governing body doubled its revenue to about A$172 million ($154
million) in the year ended June 30, 2012.  Wood was a former junior rival of 1986 Wimbledon champion
Pat Cash and played on the men’s tennis circuit from 1985 to
1987. He quit the sport to focus on a career in the
telecommunications industry before joining Tennis  Australia .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
