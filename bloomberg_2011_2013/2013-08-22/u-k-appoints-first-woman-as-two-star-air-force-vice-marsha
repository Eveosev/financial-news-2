The Royal Air Force appointed its
first ever woman to the position of Air Vice-Marshal, entitling
her to wear two stars on her uniform as the U.K. military said
it would encourage women to aim for high-ranking careers.  Elaine West, 51, who has had a 34-year career in the force,
has been appointed director of projects and program delivery at
the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, which oversees the
military’s estates. Her new job will involve delivering
infrastructure projects to support training, improving defense
capability and overseeing British troops returning from  Germany .  “We need the best and the brightest talent in senior
positions as we transform defense over the next few years,”
Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said in an e-mail. “I am
pleased that we are demonstrating in defense that there are no
’glass ceilings’ for female officers who have the necessary
abilities to rise to the senior ranks.”  Defense budget cuts mean the U.K. is scaling back its
regular military and relying on doubling the number of
reservists to 30,000 by 2020. British troops have been stationed
in Germany since the end of World War II, with numbers peaking
at 50,000 at the height of the  Cold War . That number dropped to
20,000 in the early 1990s after German reunification. Their
return is designed to save the U.K. 240 million pounds ($374
million) a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
