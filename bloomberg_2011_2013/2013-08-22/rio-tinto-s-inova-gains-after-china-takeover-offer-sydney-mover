Inova Resources Ltd. (IVA) , an Australian
minerals exploration company controlled by Rio Tinto Group, rose
the most in two months after Shanxi Donghui Coal Coking &
Chemicals Co.’s A$160 million ($143 million) takeover bid.  Inova gained 24 percent, the most since June 6, to 21 cents
at 10:53 a.m. time in Sydney trading. Shanxi Donghui yesterday
made a conditional offer of 22 cents a share, 29 percent more
than its previous close.  Buying Inova, formerly called Ivanhoe Resources  Australia 
Ltd., would give Shanxi Donghui copper as well as molybdenum
deposits and processing facilities in Australia.  Turquoise Hill
Resources Ltd. (TRQ) , the Rio unit that  owns about  56 percent of
Inova, said it had provisionally agreed to sell about a 14.9
percent stake in the company to the bidder.  The offer is subject to a minimum acceptance condition of
51 percent. Inova’s independent board committee is assessing the
offer, with UBS AG and Corrs Chambers Westgarth advising. Rio
gained the stake in Inova in 2011 when it won control of
Turquoise Hill, owner of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in  Mongolia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
