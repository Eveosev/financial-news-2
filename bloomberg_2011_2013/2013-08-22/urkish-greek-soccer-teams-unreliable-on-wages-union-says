Soccer players must take advice
before signing for teams in  Turkey ,  Greece  and Cyprus because of
the risk of being paid wages late or not all, according to
international player union FIFPro.  Players should consult local soccer union officials about
the finances of clubs, especially those that aren’t in European
competition and don’t have to adhere to continental ruling body
UEFA’s licensing system,  Hoofddorp, Netherlands-based FIFPro
said on its website .  The off-season trading period in most of Europe’s major
leagues closes Sept. 2.  “Clubs do everything possible to win players over,
offering them fabulous wages, a luxurious home, ambitious
plans” and bonuses, FIFPro said. “Unfortunately, FIFPro has
found that many clubs don’t keep these promises.”  It’s time-consuming and sometimes impossible for players to
get what they are owed if clubs declare themselves bankrupt,
according to FIFPro.  Cyprus’s top division has the highest ratio of foreign
players in European soccer at 74.2 percent, according to the
 CIES Football Observatory  in Neuchatel,  Switzerland .  Almost 51 percent of players in Turkey’s elite division are
foreigners, compared to about 35 percent in Greece.  To contact the reporters on this story:
