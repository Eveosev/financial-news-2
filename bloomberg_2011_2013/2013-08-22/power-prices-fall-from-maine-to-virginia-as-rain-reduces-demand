Spot wholesale electricity prices
from  Maine  to  Virginia  declined as cloud coverage and periods of
heavy rain helped reduce demand.  Northeast prices reversed gains as demand slipped below
day-earlier levels. New York prices had surged earlier after the
state grid operator issued a thunderstorm alert from 8:45 a.m.
until 12:55 p.m. that reduced the city’s power imports while
exports to New England increased following the shutdown of the
Pilgrim reactor in  Massachusetts .  The regions saw scattered rain today, with temperatures
averaging 2 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 to 2.2 degrees Celsius)
above normal in the Northeast and 3 to 5 degrees higher in the
mid-Atlantic states, according to WSI Corp. in Andover,
Massachusetts.  Spot on-peak electricity  for  New York  City dropped $7.60,
or 13 percent, to $49.39 a megawatt-hour as of 4 p.m. from
yesterday’s full-day average, grid data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. Prices briefly  surged  to $293.28 at 9 a.m. On-peak hours
are from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m.  Boston on-peak average prices  fell $6.07, or 13 percent, to
$40.76 a megawatt-hour. The premium for New York power versus
 Boston  narrowed to $7.19 from $10.16 yesterday.  The amount of power flowing onto the New York Independent
System Operator Inc. network from  Quebec  climbed back to more
than 1,400 megawatts after plunging to 679 megawatts at 8:35
a.m., the grid operator’s website showed. Exports to ISO New
England Inc. totaled 496 megawatts at 4:14 p.m. after jumping to
964 megawatts five hours earlier.  Nuclear Plant  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  took the Pilgrim reactor off line at 7:55
a.m. today “due to an electrical fault associated with the
plant’s feedwater pumps” that supply water to the reactor,
Carol Wightman, a spokeswoman for the company in New Orleans,
said in an e-mailed statement. “Operators will restart the
plant after a review of the cause of the electrical fault and
any necessary repairs are complete.”  The unit was shut based on plant procedures and back-up
pumps were automatically activated to maintain reactor water
levels, she said.  Pilgrim, about 4 miles (6 kilometers) east of Plymouth, was
operating at 99 percent of capacity early today, Nuclear
Regulatory Commission data show. Pilgrim’s summer capacity is
685 megawatts, according to data from the Energy Information
Administration.  Storm Alert  “The combination of a sharp real-time drop in output from
Pilgrim and a thunderstorm alert in New York City during the
same hour” had driven up prices earlier in the day, said Matt
Oatway, a Boston-based analyst with Genscape Inc., which tracks
real-time power data.  Power for the 13-state PJM Interconnection LLC network,
serving more than 60 million people from  New Jersey  to North
Carolina and  Illinois , dropped as demand slumped and moved below
forecasts. The on-peak average at the  Western hub , which
includes deliveries to  Washington , declined $15.81, or 30
percent, to $37.66 a megawatt-hour as of 4 p.m. from yesterday’s
average.  Spot prices in Texas, the Midwest and California also
declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
