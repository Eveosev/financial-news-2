Canadian  stocks  rose the most in two
weeks, as metal producers advanced after a purchasing manager’s
index in  China  showed manufacturing unexpectedly expanded this
month.  Miners  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)  and First Quantum Minerals Ltd.
jumped at least 3.8 percent as copper rallied.  Barrick Gold
Corp. (ABX)  added 3.1 percent after agreeing to sell three of its
mines in  Australia  for $300 million.  Suncor Energy (SU)  Inc. advanced
1.5 percent as crude climbed from a two-week low. WesternZagros
Resources Ltd. plunged 27 percent after reporting disappointing
results from a test well.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 101.27
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,674.35 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
biggest gain since Aug. 8. The index has advanced 1.5 percent in
August. Trading volume was 5.5 percent lower than the 30-day
average at this time of the day.  The report from China “is indicative of a soft landing,”
said  Bob Decker , a  fund manager  with Aurion Capital Management
in Toronto. The firm manages about C$6 billion ($5.7 billion).
“We still need more data from China. It’s too early to call the
end of the slowdown just yet.”  A factory index released today showed Chinese manufacturing
resumed expansion this month after shrinking the most in almost
a year in July. Growth in the world’s second-biggest economy has
been slowing in recent quarters.     China is Canada’s No. 2
trading partner and the largest consumer of metals and energy.  “This is good news for resource markets,” said  David Rosenberg , chief economist and strategist with Gluskin Sheff &
Associates Inc., in a note to clients today.  Metals Producers  Raw-materials producers increased 2.3 percent, the  most  in
the S&P/TSX as nine of 10 industries advanced.  Teck Resources, Canada’s largest diversified miner, jumped
3.8 percent to C$27.29 and First Quantum Minerals rallied 5
percent to C$18.58. Copper rallied 0.7 percent in New York, and
nickel, tin and zinc prices advanced in London.  Barrick Gold, the world’s largest producer of the metal,
rose 3.1 percent to C$20.57 after agreeing to the $300 million
deal with Gold Fields Ltd. The move is part of Barrick’s plan to
sell assets and cut costs to offset a drop in the price of gold,
which plunged in April by the most in three decades.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K)  increased 3.1 percent to C$5.97 and
Torex Gold Resources Inc. surged 6.3 percent to C$1.70 as the
price of the metal for December delivery climbed for the second
time in three days.  Crude Oil  Suncor Energy added 1.5 percent to C$35.38 and BlackPearl
Resources Inc. surged 8.5 percent to C$2.05. The S&P/TSX Energy
Index advanced 0.5 percent as crude rebounded after falling
yesterday to the lowest level since Aug. 8.  Bombardier Inc. gained 2.8 percent to C$4.70, snapping
three days of losses. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. advanced 3.6
percent to C$128.33, for the largest increase in three months,
as the S&P/TSX Industrials Index rallied 1.5 percent for the
first increase in four days.  WesternZagros Resources (WZR)  plunged 27 percent to C$1.10, the
most since May 2010. Tests of the Kurdamir-3 well in Iraq’s
Kurdistan region resulted in non-commercial flow rates,
WesternZagros said in a statement yesterday.  “There was disappointment over one of their major wells,”
Aurion’s Decker said. “It’s a one-hit wonder: if this play
works out the stock is a home run, but it’s a very high risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
