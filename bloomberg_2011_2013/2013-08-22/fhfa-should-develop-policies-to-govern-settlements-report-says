The  Federal Housing Finance Agency 
should develop a formal review process for settlements that levy
fees on lenders or take away their right to service home loans,
according to a report from its watchdog.  The agency, which oversees government-backed mortgage firms
 Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac (FMCC) , should have more formal policies to
govern how it decides what banks must pay for missing
foreclosure timelines and other actions, according to a report
from the agency’s inspector general, Steve Linick. The FHFA
agreed to enact the conclusions.  The report examined the FHFA’s review and approval of the
$11.7 billion agreement between  Bank of America Corp.  and Fannie
Mae. The accord was designed to resolve most mortgage disputes
between the two entities, and involved the bank paying $3.6
billion in cash, $6.75 billion to buy back residential loans
sold to  Fannie Mae , and $1.3 billion in fees for taking too long
to assist or foreclose on overdue borrowers.  “There are several opportunities for improvement that FHFA
might wish to consider,” according to the inspector general’s
report. “The most important would be the development of
procedures for settlements of compensatory fee claims and
significant MSR transactions.”  The report said FHFA agreed with the inspector general’s
findings and committed to establishing guidelines for fees of
more than $50 million and servicing-rights transfers by Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
