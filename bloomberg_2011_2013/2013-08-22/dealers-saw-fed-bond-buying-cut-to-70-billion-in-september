Primary dealers expected the  Federal
Reserve  to reduce the pace of its asset purchases in September
by $15 billion, to $70 billion a month, a July survey showed.  The median forecast in the survey by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York saw the central bank buying $35 billion of
Treasuries and $35 billion of mortgage-backed securities next
month, according to the survey conducted before the  Federal Open
Market Committee ’s July 30-31 meeting. The FOMC’s next meeting
is scheduled for Sept. 17-18.  Fed officials last month affirmed their plan to keep  buying 
$45 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage bonds per
month in an effort to bring down joblessness of 7.4 percent. Fed
officials were “broadly comfortable” with Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to taper this year if the economy strengthens,
minutes of the July meeting released yesterday showed.  Bond dealers expected the $70 billion pace to continue
until December, when monthly Treasury buying would be lowered to
$30 billion and mortgage purchases cut to $25 billion, according
to the survey. The Fed’s third round of quantitative easing will
be completed in June, the dealers predicted.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
