The liquefied natural gas tanker
Arctic Aurora is docked off  Statoil ASA (STL) â€™s Hammerfest LNG
terminal in northern Norway, ship-tracking data show.  The vessel, with a capacity of about 155,000 cubic meters,
arrived in Norway Aug. 20 without cargo. It used the Northern
Sea Route after completing its trials in  South Korea , according
to ship transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg.  The route reduces the sailing time between Europe and Asia,
and can be used by ships from July to November, when there is
less ice. The Ob River was the first LNG vessel to sail the
passage in October 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
