The  New York Mets  signed former
Boston Red Sox pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka to a one-year contract
and made him the starter for tonight’s home game against the
Detroit Tigers.  The Mets, whose starting rotation has been hampered by
injuries to Jeremy Hefner and Jenrry Mejia, announced the
signing yesterday in an e-mailed release without giving
additional contract details.  Matsuzaka had been pitching for the Cleveland Indians’
Triple-A affiliate in Columbus, Ohio, where he was 5-8 with a
3.92 earned run average and 95 strikeouts in 103 innings. He has
not pitched in  Major League Baseball  this season.  Matsuzaka, 32, joined the Red Sox in 2007 from Japan and
signed a six-year, $52 million contract after the team paid
$51.1 million for the right to negotiate with him. He was
granted free agency after last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
