Indonesian stocks fell, with the
benchmark index entering a  bear market  after losing 20 percent
from a record high three months ago.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  declined 1.1 percent to close
at 4,171.41, the lowest since Sept. 13, 2012. Animal feed
producer PT Charoen Pokphand  Indonesia  dropped 13 percent and
was the biggest drag on the index. PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia, the
country’s second largest lender by assets, fell 4.4 percent.  A record current-account deficit in the second quarter and
worse-than-expected economic growth and inflation data spurred
investors to offload stocks and send the rupiah to its weakest
level since April 2009. Foreign investors sold a net of $434.7
million worth of equities this week through yesterday.  “The market is likely to remain sideways or down.”
Laurentia Amica Darmawan, a  fund manager  at First State
Investments, which manages about 5.9 trillion rupiah ($529.4
million), said by phone from Jakarta. “There has been no major
catalyst to drive the market up. Investors will wait for the
next inflation numbers so they can determine if it has reached
its peak.”  Interest-rate sensitive industries including property,
construction and automotive are likely to be under pressure in
the near term, Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Ferry Wong said in
report yesterday. Wong is overweight media, bank and cement
stocks as well as some consumer-goods companies. PT Bank
Mandiri, PT Bank Negara Indonesia, PT Surya Citra Media, PT
Media Nusantara Citra and PT Semen Indonesia are among
Citigroup’s top picks.  The slump for the Jakarta index pushed its valuation to
 12.3 times  projected 12-month earnings, the lowest level since
June 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure’s valuation reached 15.9 times on May 20.  The rupiah fell 0.4 percent to 10,818 per dollar, after
reaching 10,826 earlier, its weakest level since April 2009. The
yield on 10-year  government bonds  fell to 8.42 percent, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
