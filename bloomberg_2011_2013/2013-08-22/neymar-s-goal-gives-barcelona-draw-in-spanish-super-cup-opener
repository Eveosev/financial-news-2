Neymar scored his first competitive
goal for Barcelona to secure a 1-1 draw against  Atletico Madrid 
in the opening game of the Spanish Super Cup.  The Brazilian striker, whom Barca signed from Santos for 57
million euros ($76 million) in June, came off the bench to score
a header with 24 minutes left at the Vicente Calderon stadium in
 Madrid  last night. Former Barca forward  David Villa  had given
Atletico the lead in the 12th minute.  The return game in the matchup between the Spanish league
champion and the Copa del Rey winner is Aug. 28 at Barcelona’s
Camp Nou stadium. Barca, which won La Liga by 15 points last
season, is playing in the two-match series for the fifth
straight year.  Four-time world player of the year Lionel Messi will
undergo tests today after being substituted at half time because
of a left thigh injury, Barca coach Gerardo Martino said in
comments on his team’s web site.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
