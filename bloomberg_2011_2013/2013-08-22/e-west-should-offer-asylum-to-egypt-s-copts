A  he artbreaking story out of Egypt today , as a 1,600-year-old church is destroyed by rampaging mobs of Muslim Brotherhood supporters, angry at the Christian Coptic minority for its perceived opposition to the Brotherhood’s rule. The Church of the Virgin Mary has now been destroyed, along with a couple of dozen others, in reprisal for the military crackdown. I can’t pretend to know what we should do about Egypt, where all of President Barack Obama’s options seem bad. But one thing seems obvious to me: The U.S., along with other nations, should offer greater sanctuary to the Copts, who are clearly at risk as this drama plays out. This animus toward the large Coptic minority is not new -- a friend whose grandfather was a prominent Coptic cleric once told me that his grandfather was used to spending time in jail because Hosni Mubarak would lock up some notable Copts every time he sensed the Muslim majority was getting restless. But this seems to be one of the worst spates of church-burning in Egypt since the Middle Ages. There’s a real risk that the widespread attacks on the Copts' buildings will progress to widespread attacks on their people. Egyptian refugees are already coming to the U.S. in greater numbers, many of them Copts joining  existing communities  in New York City and elsewhere. (U.S. immigration statistics don't include a breakdown by religious affiliation.) In 2012, the U.S.  granted asylum  -- a legal status conferred on qualified refugees who have made it to the U.S. -- to 2,882 Egyptians, up from 1,026 in 2011 and representing just under 10 percent of all asylees. (Egypt came in second, after China.) Increasing that number significantly would be a major undertaking, but could be done with expedited processing and the creation of special criteria, as has been done with other groups in the past. Doing so could provide a haven for many of the Copts who want to leave -- and send a strong signal to both the military and the Egyptian Brotherhood about what the world thinks of what is going on in their country.
