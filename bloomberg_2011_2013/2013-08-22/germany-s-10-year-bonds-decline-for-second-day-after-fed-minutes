German  government bonds  dropped for
a second day after a euro-area report showed services output
expanded in August for the first time in 19 months, adding to
evidence the region is pulling out of its economic slump.  Benchmark 10-year bund yields climbed to the highest since
March 2012 after Federal Reserve minutes released yesterday
showed most policy makers were “broadly comfortable” with
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to reduce debt purchases this
year. French, Dutch and Austrian bonds also declined. German 10-year yields climbed to as high as 1.94 percent today, from this
year’s low of 1.15 percent set on May 2. Italian and Spanish
securities rose as investors sought higher-yielding assets.  “There’s increasing evidence that the euro zone is
bouncing back from very depressed levels,” said Robin Marshall,
director of fixed income at Smith & Williamson Investment
Management in  London . “It’s a reflection of improved confidence
which is likely to push yields higher in the near-term. But it’s
unclear how far bond rates can go from here given the region
still has a number of hurdles to jump over in coming months.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.92 percent at 4:27 p.m. London time. The
rate increased three basis points yesterday. The 1.5 percent
bond maturing in May 2023 fell 0.43, or 4.30 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,336) face amount, to 96.30.  France ’s 10-year yield climbed five basis points to 2.48
percent, while similar-maturity Dutch rates rose four basis
points to 2.32 percent and  Austria ’s increased four basis points
to 2.34 percent.  Fed Purchases  The Fed will reduce its monthly purchases of $85 billion in
bonds at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent
economists in an Aug. 9-13 Bloomberg survey. The median estimate
is for a cut to $75 billion each month.  “Almost all committee members agreed that a change in the
purchase program was not yet appropriate,” and a few said “it
might soon be time to slow somewhat the pace of purchases as
outlined in that plan,” according to the minutes of the Federal
Open Market Committee’s July 30-31 gathering.  The Fed’s debate over when to scale back its stimulus has
roiled financial markets around the world. Some policy makers
have said the purchases, while helping reduce unemployment, are
stoking excessive risk taking in assets such as  junk bonds  and
leveraged loans.  “The focus is now shifting from when the Fed will start to
taper their bond purchases to the pace of tapering,” said
Willem Sels, head of investment strategy at  HSBC Private Bank  in
London. “Bond yields in core markets, including those in
 Europe , may continue to rise amid speculation about the pace at
which the Fed reduces its purchases.”  Output Expands  An index of euro-area  services  based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  rose to 51 this month from 49.8 in July,
London-based Markit Economics said. A composite index of
services and manufacturing climbed to 51.7 from 50.5. Readings
above 50 indicates expansion.  Gross domestic product in the euro region rose 0.3 percent
in the three months through June after six quarterly
contractions, according to data published on Aug. 14.  Spain ’s  10-year yield  dropped five basis points to 4.48
percent after climbing to 4.58 percent, the highest level since
Aug. 7. The rate on similar-maturity Italian debt declined five
basis points to 4.32 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
securities instead of German bunds fell 10 basis points to 239
basis points. The spread narrowed to 227 on Aug. 19, the
tightest since July 2011.  “The reasonably strong set of data has seen a great
rotation-type scenario being traded,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a
fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in London.
“German bunds come under pressure as investors move into
peripherals and equities.”  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Belgium and Austria,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German securities lost 2.3 percent this year through
yesterday according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian
bonds returned 3.8 percent, while Spain’s earned 7.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
