Oil production in  Texas ’s Eagle Ford
shale formation rose 60 percent in June from the same month the
year before.  The nine fields that make up the majority of Eagle Ford
yielded 617,884 barrels of crude a day, according to preliminary
data released by the  Texas Railroad Commission , which oversees
oil and gas drilling in the state. The fields produced 386,763
barrels daily in June 2012.  May output was revised to 625,833 barrels a day from the
preliminary report of 581,923, the commission said. Production
totals typically increase in subsequent months as the state
receives revised, corrected or late reports.  Growing production from Eagle Ford is helping fuel a
renaissance in Texas crude. The  state  produced a total of 2.53
million barrels a day in May, the highest monthly level since
April 1982, according to the Energy Information Administration,
the statistical arm of the Energy Department. The EIA hasn’t
released June production data for the state.  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)  is the largest leaseholder in the Eagle
Ford play, with 639,000 net acres.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  is
next with 485,000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Plains Marketing LP’s  posted price  for Eagle Ford light oil
was $100.25 a barrel Aug. 21, compared with the settlement
prices of $103.85 for West Texas Intermediate and $109.81 for
Brent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
