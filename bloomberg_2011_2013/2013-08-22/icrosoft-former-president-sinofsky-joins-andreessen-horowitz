Steven Sinofsky, the former
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  executive who was pushed out in November, said
on his blog that he’s joined venture-firm Andreessen Horowitz as
a board partner.  “In this position I will represent the firm on the boards
of portfolio companies when the opportunities present
themselves, but will not be a full-time member of the firm,”
Sinofsky  wrote . Sinofsky added that he will keep his current
position as executive in residence at Harvard Business School.  Andreessen Horowitz has been staffing up with experienced
technology executives since opening in 2009. In addition to
founders Marc Andreessen and  Ben Horowitz , who have worked
together since the 1990s, the firm’s partners also include
former  OpenTable Inc. (OPEN)  Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jordan,
IronPort Systems Inc. co-founder Scott Weiss and SuccessFactors
Inc. founder Lars Dalgaard.  Andreessen Horowitz, based in Menlo Park, California,
confirmed the hiring of Sinofsky in an e-mail and said he will
not be an investing partner.  Sinofsky, a 23-year Microsoft veteran, left the Redmond,
Washington-based company last year after clashes with
executives, including CEO  Steve Ballmer , people with knowledge
of the matter said in November. Sinofsky was president of the
Windows operating system division.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is an investor
in Andreessen Horowitz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
