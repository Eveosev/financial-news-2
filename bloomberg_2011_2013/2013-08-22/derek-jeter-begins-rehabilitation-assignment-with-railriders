Derek Jeter begins another
rehabilitation assignment today at the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre
RailRiders.  The  New York  Yankees shortstop returned to the 15-day
disabled list with a strained right calf muscle Aug. 5 after
playing his fifth game this season.  Jeter, 39, missed the first 91 games of the Major League
Baseball season while recovering from a fractured left ankle. He
strained a thigh muscle while running the bases in his season
debut on July 11, forcing him to miss another 12 games.  “We’ll go day-by-day and see how he responds each day, but
the plan I think is for him to play fiving innings in the field
tomorrow and go from there,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi said
yesterday.  Jeter is hitting .211 with one home run and two runs batted
in this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
