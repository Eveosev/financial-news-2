U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened
versus futures for the first time in four days as the summer
driving season draws to a close and the transition between
summer and winter grade gasoline begins.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast lost 0.5 cent to a discount of 15.75 cents a gallon below
 New York  Mercantile Exchange futures at 2:45 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, the first drop since Aug. 16.  “It’s bearish because winter grade is easier to make and
after the Labor Day holiday, demand starts declining,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  weakened by 0.25 cent to
5.5 cents a gallon less than futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel 
was unchanged at 2 cents below futures on the Nymex.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate crude in Cushing,  Oklahoma , weakened by 76
cents to $16.21 a barrel. The  same spread based  on Light
Louisiana Sweet oil lost 86 cents to $12.71.  To contact the reporter on this story:
