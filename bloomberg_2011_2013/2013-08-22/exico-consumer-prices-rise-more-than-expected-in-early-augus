Mexican consumer prices rose more
than expected in early August, pushing the annual inflation rate
higher.  Prices climbed 0.26 percent in the first two weeks of the
month, the national statistics agency said today on its website,
compared with the 0.16 percent median forecast of 16 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Annual inflation was 3.54 percent
compared with 3.47 percent at the end of July. Core prices,
which exclude energy and farm costs, gained 0.11 percent in the
first half of the month.  The central bank forecasts inflation will end the year at
about 3.5 percent and remain close to the 3 percent target next
year after a surge in farm prices subsided. While inflation had
slowed more than expected in the past three months and the
government slashed its 2013 growth forecast to 1.8 percent from
3.1 percent, the majority of economists predict the central bank
won’t cut rates this year, according to an Aug. 20 survey by
Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit.  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 13.2015 per dollar at 8:04
a.m. in Mexico City. The currency has weakened 9.6 percent from
an almost two-year high in May on speculation the U.S. Federal
Reserve will dial back record stimulus.  To contact the reporters on this story:
