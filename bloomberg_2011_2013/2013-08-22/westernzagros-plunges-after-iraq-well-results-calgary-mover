WesternZagros Resources Ltd. (WZR)  dropped
the most in almost three years after the Canadian oil explorer
said initial results from a test well in  Iraq  failed to meet
expected flow rates.  The shares fell as much as 27 percent to C$1.10 at 10:47
a.m. in Toronto. The decline was the largest intraday drop since
Oct. 13, 2010.  Tests of the Kurdamir-3 well in Iraq’s Kurdistan region
resulted in non-commercial flow rates, WesternZagros said in a
statement yesterday. The company is unlikely to meet its pre-drill objective at Kudamir-3 of increasing contingent resources
by 200 million barrels, said Tudor Pickering analyst Gerry Donnelly.  “Despite the fact the lowest zone was always expected to
be of lower quality than upper zones that await testing, we
believe the market’s expectation remains on delivering nothing
short of a defining test rate that establishes field
commerciality,” Donnelly said in a note to clients today.  WesternZagros, based in Calgary, has been examining the
potential for oil and gas production in Kurdistan since 2003 and
began trading on the Toronto exchange in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
