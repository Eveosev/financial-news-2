Indonesia , the world’s largest palm
oil producer, reduced the duty on shipments of the crude variety
for the first time in four months to increase sales after prices
tumbled to a three-year low.  The tax will be cut to 9 percent in September from 10.5
percent this month, Faiz Achmad, director of food and fishery at
the Industry Ministry, said in a text message today. The rate
will match that of June when it was kept unchanged from May,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures in Kuala Lumpur slumped to the lowest since October
2009 last month as supplies outpaced demand. While the cut in
tariff will narrow the gap with the levy in  Malaysia , it will
still be double the rate in the second-largest grower that kept
the tax unchanged at 4.5 percent for a seventh month in
September.  “It means nothing for exports,” said Joelianto, trading
director at PT Sinar Mas Agro Resources and Technology.
“Indonesia is still losing to Malaysia as they have better
margins.”  Exports fell 1.6 percent to 1.59 million tons in July,
according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, while
shipments from Malaysia rose 0.5 percent to 1.42 million tons,
according to the nation’s palm oil board.  World stockpiles of the oil that’s used in everything from
candy to biofuel will surge 21 percent to a record 9.7 million
metric tons by the end of 2013-2014, while demand expands 4.6
percent, the least in 12 years, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  says. Output in Indonesia may climb to a record 28
million tons this year from 25.7 million in 2012, Derom Bangun,
chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Board, said July 25. Exports
may gain to 19 million tons from about 18 million tons, he said.  Futures, which fell to a three-year low of 2,137 ringgit
($644) a ton on July 26, ere at 2,349 ringgit on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives today.  The Indonesian government reviews the tax rates and base
export prices every month, based on average rates in  Kuala
Lumpur , Rotterdam and Jakarta. The tax will be set at 9 percent
if price falls in the range of between $800 to $850.  To contact the reporters on this story:
