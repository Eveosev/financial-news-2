PetroChina, the countryâ€™s biggest
oil and natural gas producer, posted a 5.6 percent increase in
first-half profit as gas and crude production gained.  Net income increased to 65.5 billion  yuan  ($10.7 billion),
or 0.36 yuan a share, in the six months ended June 30 from 62
billion yuan, or 0.34 yuan, a year earlier, the Beijing-based
energy explorer and oil refiner said today in a statement to the
 Hong Kong  stock exchange. Revenue climbed 5.2 percent to 1.1
trillion yuan.  PetroChina produced 697.2 million barrels of oil equivalent
in the first half, up 4.4 percent from a year earlier, while the
average realized crude price dropped 6.9 percent to $100.49 per
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
