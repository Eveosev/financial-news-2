Atlanta Braves outfielder Jason Heyward had two metal plates placed in his jaw that was broken
by a fastball thrown by Jon Niese of the  New York Mets .  Heyward, 24, was struck by the 90 mile-per-hour (145
kilometer-per-hour) pitch in the sixth inning of Atlanta’s 4-1
win at Citi Field in  New York  yesterday.  Heyward had surgery today in Atlanta, the Major League
Baseball team said in a statement. The Braves, who at 77-49 have
the best record in the major leagues, didn’t say how long
Heyward’s recovery would take.  Since moving into the leadoff role for Atlanta on July 28,
Heyward has batted .345 with a .408 on-base percentage and a
.586 slugging percentage  Heyward missed almost a month of the season after an
emergency appendectomy in Denver on April 22. He returned to the
