West Texas Intermediate crude rose
from a two-week low as the fewest U.S. workers in more than five
years applied for unemployment benefits over the past month,
bolstering optimism that fuel demand will accelerate.  Prices gained for the first time in four days as claims in
the month ended Aug. 17 declined to 330,500 a week  on average ,
the least since November 2007, the Labor Department reported.
The index of U.S. leading indicators rose in July by the most in
three months.  Chinese manufacturing  resumed expansion and output
at European factories improved. WTI’s discount to Brent narrowed
more than $1.  “You had positive economic data, which should imply
greater demand,” said Tom Finlon, the Jupiter, Florida-based
director of Energy Analytics Group LLC. “The market should
drift higher.”  WTI for October delivery rose $1.18, or 1.1 percent, to
settle at $105.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The volume of all futures traded was 25 percent below the 100-day average at 3:21 p.m. The contract fell to $103.85 yesterday,
the lowest close since Aug. 8.  Brent for October settlement gained 9 cents to $109.90 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume
was 28 percent below 100-day average. The European benchmark’s
premium to WTI shrank to $4.87 from $5.96 yesterday, the widest
level since June 26.  Jobless Claims  Compared with a  week earlier , jobless claims rose by 13,000
to 336,000, the Labor Department said. That’s in line with the
 median  forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the economic outlook for
the next three to six months increased 0.6 percent after no
change the prior month.  A preliminary purchasing managers index for  China  by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics rose to 50.1 from 47.7,
exceeding all 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. A reading
above 50 indicates expansion.  A measure of German  manufacturing  compiled by Markit
climbed to 52 in August from 50.7 in July. The  median economist
estimate  had called for a reading of 51.1, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  “The jobless claims are decent and Chinese manufacturing
is pretty strong,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at
the Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “The economic numbers
increased demand expectations.”  Fuel Demand  Total fuel  demand  in the U.S. rose 1.3 percent last week to
19.3 million barrels a day, the Energy Information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department,
said yesterday.  Crude  inventories  dropped for a third week to 359.1 million
barrels, the lowest level since Aug. 31, 2012, as refineries
boosted their utilization rate to above 90 percent, the EIA
report showed.  “Fundamentally, the market should trade higher,” Finlon
said.  Brent was little changed as Libya said it will resume oil
exports from Brega, one of four ports where it declared force
majeure this week, as protests that shut the facilities since
the end of July eased.  Libyan Terminals  Brega may add some 90,000 barrels a day to Libyan shipments
that are running at 500,000 barrels a day, shipped through the
Zawiya terminal, in Western Libya, and the offshore loading
platforms of Mellitah, Al Jurf and Bouri, the National Oil Corp.
said. Es Sider, the nation’s largest terminal, Ras Lanuf and
Zueitina remain shut.  Libyan tribesmen stepped up efforts to persuade oil-port
guards to end protests that curtailed the North African nation’s
crude exports, a spokesman for the security force said.  The country produced 800,000 barrels a day of crude last
month, half the rate pumped a year earlier, according to a
Bloomberg survey of output from the 12-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. Libya holds  Africa ’s largest oil
reserves. Nigerian output fell 5.4 percent last month to 1.92
million.  “Oil is a world market,” said John Felmy, chief economist
at the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute in
 Washington . “We’re seeing problems with production in the
Middle East.”  Fed Minutes  WTI dropped earlier as the Federal Reserve signaled a
likely reduction in economic stimulus this year. The minutes of
the July Fed meeting, released yesterday, showed policy makers
were “broadly comfortable” with curbing the $85 billion in
monthly bond buying later this year if the economy improves.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
October was 21.3 percent, down from 22.7 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 423,244
contracts as of 3:22 p.m. It totaled 572,775 contracts
yesterday, 12 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.82 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
