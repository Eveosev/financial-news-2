Natural gas futures climbed for the
third time in four days after a government report showed that
U.S. stockpiles expanded by less than forecast last week.  Gas gained 2.5 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said inventories rose 57 billion cubic feet in
the week ended Aug. 16 to 3.063 trillion cubic feet. Analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed a gain of 65 billion. A
survey of Bloomberg users predicted an increase of 62 billion.  “The storage number was well below expectations,” said
Aaron Calder, an analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston.
“Gas demand from power generators has been strong. The
forecasts are showing hotter-than-normal temperatures across the
Midwest and there’s really going to be significant cooling
demand.”  Natural gas for September delivery rose 8.5 cents to settle
at $3.545 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement price since July 26.
Volume was 23 percent above the 100-day average at 2:35 p.m. Gas
is up 5.8 percent this year.  The discount of September to October futures narrowed 0.1
cent to 3 cents. October gas traded 37.9 cents below the January
contract, compared with 39.1 cents yesterday.  September $3.50 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 5 cents lower at 3.1 cents per
million Btu on volume of 704 at 2:51 p.m. Puts accounted for 69
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money
options expiring in October was 31.69 percent at 2:45 p.m.,
compared with 32.78 percent yesterday.  Supply Report  The stockpile increase was bigger than the five-year
average gain for the week of 56 billion cubic feet, EIA data
show. A  surplus  to the five-year average was unchanged from a
week earlier at 1.5 percent. Supplies were 7.2 percent below
year-earlier inventories, compared with 7.7 percent in last
week’s report.  Commodity Weather Group LLC said temperatures may be higher
than usual in the Midwest through Sept. 5. The high in  Chicago 
on Aug. 31 may be 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), 10 more
than average, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,
 Pennsylvania .  The high in Indianapolis on Aug. 31 may be 92 degrees
Fahrenheit, 9 above average, AccuWeather data show. Power
generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas demand, according
to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  There are “downside risks” to Bank of America Corp.’s
2014 gas price forecast of $4.20 per million British thermal
units as production from the Marcellus shale formation grows,
 Francisco Blanch , head of commodities research at the bank in
New York, said in a note to clients dated yesterday.  “ North America  simply remains awash with dry natural
gas,” Blanch said in the report.  Gas Output  The U.S. cut its 2013 natural gas production estimate to
69.89 billion cubic feet a day from last month’s forecast of
69.96 billion, the EIA said Aug. 6 in in its Short-Term Energy
Outlook. Output may rise 1 percent from a year ago to a record
as onshore supplies climb.  Inventories may total 3.8 trillion cubic feet at the end of
October, about 130 billion below last year’s level for the time
of year, the EIA said.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
last week rose by two to 388 last week, data from Baker Hughes
Inc. in Houston show. The total is down 10 percent this year.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first four months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1985, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
