  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s third-biggest iron ore exporter, remains in talks to
sell a minority stake in its port and rail assets after offers
to date didn’t meet its expectations.  “It’s not shelved, we’re in discussions right now,”
Neville Power, chief executive officer of the Perth-based
company, told reporters on a media call. While significant
offers were received, they haven’t met objectives for value and
terms, the company said in a statement. A sale could raise an
estimated $3 billion, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Fortescue, which sold $5 billion in loans to  cut debt  after
prices fell last year, started talks in December for the sale of
a stake in its port and railroad assets. The company, which
plans to boost capacity to 155 million metric tons, has
benefited from higher-than-expected iron ore prices and pre-payments from customers.  “There is no pre-set idea on how a deal should be
structured,” Power said. “That has allowed people to come to
us with a variety of different ideas and proposals and we
continue to assess those.”  Fortescue, which today reported net income of $1.75 billion
that met analyst expectations, gained 3.3 percent to A$4.225 at
1:31 p.m. in Sydney trading. The benchmark index fell 0.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
