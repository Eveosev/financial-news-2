Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , grappling
with the worst radioactive spill since the March 2011 nuclear
disaster, said an inspection of  storage tanks  at its wrecked
Fukushima plant showed no further leaks of irradiated water.  The inspection of about 300 tanks similar in design to the
unit that leaked contaminated water this week did reveal two
separate radiation hotspots near adjacent tanks, which the
company can’t yet explain.  “At the moment, we don’t know why radiation was
detected,” said Hiroki Kawamata, a spokesman for the utility
known as Tepco. He said there wasn’t any water found in the
areas showing high radiation levels.  The inspection comes after Tepco said on Aug. 20 that 300
tons of contaminated water had leaked into the soil from a tank
used to store water pumped from under the plant’s damaged
reactors.  Japan ’s nuclear regulator yesterday rated the accident
as a 3 on the 7-stage International Nuclear and Radiological
Event Scale or INES, denoting a “serious incident.”  The absence of further leaks allays some of the fears
surrounding the spill. Nuclear Regulation Authority Chairman
Shunichi Tanaka called the possibility of other leaky tanks
“the biggest concern” at a press conference yesterday.  Tepco stores about 400 tons of water a day at the plant
after using it to cool the reactors that melted down as a result
of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. There are more than
1,000 tanks on site holding 330,000 tons of water as of Aug. 13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
