European Union Justice Commissioner
 Viviane Reding  said she shared concerns about freedom of the
media after U.K. police detained the partner of a journalist who
broke news on U.S. surveillance programs.  “I fully share Mr. Jagland’s concerns,” Reding said today
in a message on Twitter, referring to a  letter  sent to the U.K.
government by Thorbjoern Jagland, secretary-general of the
 Council of Europe , an inter-governmental organization that
promotes democracy and human rights.  The letter from Jagland, addressed to U.K. Home Secretary
Theresa May, also cited the destruction of computer hard drives
at the Guardian newspaper related to the case.  “These measures, if confirmed, may have a potentially
chilling effect on journalists’ freedom of expression,” Jagland
wrote in the letter.  Britain’s May said on Aug. 20 that U.K. police acted
correctly in using anti-terrorism laws to detain David Miranda,
the Brazilian partner of Glenn Greenwald, who reported for the
 Guardian newspaper  on former security contractor Edward
Snowden’s allegations about U.S. surveillance programs. Miranda
was held for questioning for as long as nine hours at  London ’s
Heathrow airport on Aug. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
