Doughty Hanson  & Co., a London-based
private-equity firm, agreed to sell Spanish bus and bus-station
operator Avanza Group SA for an undisclosed sum.  Grupo ADO SA, a Mexican bus operator, purchased Avanza,
Doughty Hanson said in a statement today. The sale is the firmâ€™s
fifth in 12 months as it looks to return capital to investors
before raising a new 2 billion-euro ($2.7 billion) fund.  Doughty Hanson bought Madrid-based Avanza in February 2007
and made six acquisitions for the business, including CTSA
Portillo SA. The private-equity firm refinanced the company with
a 490 million-euro  bond issue  in May.  Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension
plans and endowments with a mandate to buy companies within five
to six years, then sell them and return the money and a profit
after 10 years. The firms usually charge a management fee of as
much as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from
investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
