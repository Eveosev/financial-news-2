Copper led gains in industrial
metals after a manufacturing index in  China  increased in August
from an 11-month low, adding to signs the world’s second-biggest
economy is stabilizing.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 1.5 percent to $7,350 a metric ton and
traded at $7,340 at 11:12 a.m. in  Tokyo . The metal fell 1.1
percent yesterday. Aluminum added 0.6 percent and nickel and
lead advanced at least 0.7 percent.  The preliminary reading of 50.1 for a  Purchasing Managers’
Index (EC11FLAS)  released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compares with a final figure of 47.7 in July and the 48.2 median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 16 economists. A number
above 50 indicates an expansion. Copper inventories tracked by
the LME declined yesterday for a 26th session.  “It’s decent number,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader
at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul . With a
strengthening U.S. economy and Europe’s moderate recovery,
copper may test the upper end of a current trading range between
$7,250 and $7,400 a ton, he said.  LME copper inventories declined 1 percent to 566,925 tons,
daily exchange data showed yesterday. Orders to withdraw the
metal from warehouses fell 0.1 percent to 297,350 tons.  Futures for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.4 percent to 52,660  yuan  ($8,597) a ton. Metal
for delivery in December was up 0.9 percent at $3.341 a pound on
the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
