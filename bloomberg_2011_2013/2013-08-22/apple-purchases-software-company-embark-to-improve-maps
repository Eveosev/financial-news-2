Apple Inc. (AAPL)  said it bought
navigation-software company Embark Inc., part of an effort to
improve the performance of its mapping system after a bungled
debut last year.  “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to
time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,”
said  Kristin Huguet , a spokeswoman for Apple.  Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  Apple, which dropped  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s map service last year in
favor of its own, has purchased several navigation software
companies. At the time, Apple’s own map software was plagued
with errors, for which Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook
apologized.  Last month, Apple agreed to buy online transit-navigation
service HopStop.com Inc. and Locationary Inc., which is focused
on business-location maps. Earlier this year, Apple also
purchased WifiSLAM, a maker of location-identifying technology
for when a smartphone user is inside a building.  Embark’s software for smartphones provides information
about public transportation, something Apple left out of its map
service when it debuted last year. Embark was backed by Y
Combinator, a startup incubator based in Mountain View,
 California , among others.  The purchase of Embark was first reported by technology
reporter Jessica Lessin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
