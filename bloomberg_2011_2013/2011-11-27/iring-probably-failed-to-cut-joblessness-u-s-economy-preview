The pace of hiring in November
probably failed to reduce unemployment in the U.S., showing
employers remain concerned growth will slow, economists said
before reports this week.  Payrolls climbed by 120,000 workers after rising 80,000 in
October, according to the median forecast of 59 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before a Dec. 2 report from the Labor
Department. The  jobless rate  probably held at 9 percent.  DirecTV (DTV)  is among companies saying they will keep a tight
rein on spending and employment in 2012 on concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis and election in the U.S. will restrain the world’s
largest economy. The lack of jobs will probably pressure wages,
depriving consumers of the means to boost spending, which
accounts for about 70 percent of the economy.  “We have a labor market that’s improving, but it’s still
not great,” said  Stephen Stanley , chief economist for Pierpont
Securities LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Uncertainty over
Europe and the U.S. fiscal situation is an impediment to firms
expanding, whether it is labor or capital investment.”  Other reports this week may show manufacturing picked up,
 new-home sales  stagnated and property prices declined.  The jobless rate has exceeded 8 percent since February
2009, the longest stretch of such levels of unemployment since
monthly records began in 1948.  The projected gain in payrolls would bring the average for
July through November to 118,000, compared with 131,000 in the
first six months of the year.  Shares Slump  Concern is growing that a European country will be forced
to default. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent to
close at 1,158.67 at 1 p.m. close in  New York  on Nov. 25,
falling for a seventh straight day, the longest streak since
August.  The payrolls report may also show private employment, which
excludes government jobs, climbed 145,000 after an October gain
of 104,000, economists forecast.  The crisis in Europe and presidential election in the U.S.
make it difficult to predict the level of economic expansion,
causing DirecTV to “slow our growth rate,”  Michael White ,
chief executive officer of the largest U.S. satellite-TV
provider said in an interview last week.  “We’re tightening our belts in terms of spending,” White
said in the Nov. 21 interview. “We’ll cut back on overhead,
hiring and programming.”  Holiday Hiring  At the same time, companies like  Macy’s Inc. (M)  are among
those adding workers for the holiday season. The second-biggest
U.S. department-store chain increased the hiring of mostly part-
time employees by 4 percent for the November-December shopping
season. See’s Candies Inc., a chocolate maker owned by Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., said it would add 5,500 mostly temporary workers
to help meet increased holiday production.  The scant number of jobs may explain why Americans’ moods
are even more terrible now than during the economic slump. The
Conference Board’s index of consumer  confidence  rose to 44 this
month, according to the Bloomberg survey median ahead of a Nov.
29 report. The gauge averaged 53.7 during the 18-month recession
that ended in June 2009.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his colleagues
this month cut economic growth forecasts for 2012 and said
unemployment will average 8.5 percent to 8.7 percent in the
final three months of next year, up from a prior range of 7.8
percent to 8.2 percent.  Manufacturing Pickup  Manufacturing is one area of the economy that continues to
grow. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory  index  of
climbed to 51.5 in November, economists surveyed by Bloomberg
projected ahead of a Dec. 1 report. Readings above 50 indicate
expansion.  Housing remains a laggard as distressed properties depress
prices and keep buyers on the sidelines. The Commerce Department
may report tomorrow that new houses  sold  at a 313,000 annual
rate in October, the same as in the prior month, the Bloomberg
survey showed. That would put the monthly average for the year
at 304,000, less than the 323,000 in 2010 that was the lowest
since data-keeping began in 1963.  Property  values  in 20 cities fell 3 percent in September
from a year earlier, economists predicted ahead of a Nov. 29
report from S&P/Case-Shiller.
