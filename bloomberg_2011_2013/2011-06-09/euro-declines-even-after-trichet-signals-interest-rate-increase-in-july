The euro weakened after the  European
Central Bank  signaled a July interest rate increase while
damping investor expectations for further moves by reiterating
that inflation will fall below its 2 percent limit next year.  The shared currency fell for a second day against the
dollar as traders closed out earlier bets on future ECB rate
increases. New Zealand’s currency climbed to a record after the
nation’s central bank said borrowing costs will need to rise in
the next two years. The Dollar Index reached the highest in a
week on speculation that dollar declines had gone too far.  “Euro strength will depend on potential for rate hikes
going forward and there are some risks; if they are anticipating
inflation to come down in the future then it might not be quite
as hawkish,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for
Gain Capital Group LLC in  New York . “It was basically buy the
rumor sell the fact. The market was largely expecting Trichet to
signal a rate hike next month with his language.”  The euro depreciated 0.5 percent to $1.4510 at 5 p.m. in
New York. It reached $1.4697 on June 7, the strongest level
since May 5. The 17-nation currency was little changed at 116.61
yen.  Market Reading  Euribor futures rose, pushing the implied yield on the
March 2012 contract down seven basis points to 1.97 percent, as
traders reduced bets policy makers will boost rates.  The euro plunged more than 2 percent to as low as $1.4510
on May 5 when the ECB left its rate at 1.25 percent, wrong-
footing some investors who had expected a faster move to combat
higher prices. Since then it had gained 1.9 percent as investors
anticipate a July increase.  “There was a fair amount of positioning going in to the
meeting and then when Trichet delivered the magic words strong
vigilance the euro popped and people who had been long said
thank you and took profit,” said Carl Forcheski, a director on
the corporate currency sales desk at Societe Generale SA in New
York. “Once we broke $1.4570 stop losses were tripped, which
pushed it down another half cent.” A long position is a bet an
asset will appreciate.  European Inflation  The ECB said inflation next year will accelerate between
1.1 percent and 2.3 percent, compared with an earlier forecast
of 1 percent to 2.4 percent. Policy makers see growth in 2012 of
0.6 percent to 2.8 percent, from a previous range of 0.8 percent
to 2.8 percent.  The euro also fell as Trichet said the central bank is not
in favor of restructuring or losses with regard to Greek
bondholders and wants to avoid any credit event or default.
Greek two-year note yields surged 178 basis points to 25.71
percent, with 10-year yields jumping 49 basis points to 16.64
percent, the highest since May 26.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six U.S. trading partners, advanced 0.3 percent to
74.183 as the  U.S. trade deficit  unexpectedly shrank 6.7 percent
to $43.7 billion in April, Commerce Department figures showed
today.  The dollar has declined 4.8 percent against nine other
currencies of developed economies in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  ‘Bearish Dollars’  “The market has been very bearish dollars in recent weeks
and very bullish yen, commodity-linked currencies and higher-
yielding currencies,” said  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S.
currency sales at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New York. “It
has been an ongoing trend that will not be switched anytime
soon, but the dollar may gain today out of exhaustion.”  The seven-day relative strength index for the Dollar Index
rose to 43.86, the highest level in two weeks, rebounding from
four days under the 30 level that indicates an asset may be due
for a correction.  New Zealand ’s dollar gained against all 16 of its most-
traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg after  Reserve Bank  of
New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard signaled the central bank will
lift  interest rates .  The New Zealand currency rose as much as 1.9 percent to a
record 83.02 U.S. cents, and advanced 2.2 percent to 66.53 yen.  The central bank’s decision today to keep the benchmark
rate unchanged at 2.5 percent was predicted by all 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Investors now expect the central bank to increase the
benchmark rate by 63 basis points over the next 12 months, up
from 56 basis points yesterday, according to a Credit Suisse
Index.  The  Bank of England  kept its benchmark rate unchanged at
0.5 percent at today’s meeting, an outcome predicted by all 55
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The pound traded at $1.6366, from $1.6404 yesterday.
Sterling was at 88.65 pence per euro, from 88.90 yesterday, when
it reached 89.76, the weakest since May 5.  The U.K. central bank will lift the rate by 29 basis points
over the next year, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index
based on swaps trading. The ECB will raise its main rate by 73
basis points in the same period, according to a separate Credit
Suisse index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
