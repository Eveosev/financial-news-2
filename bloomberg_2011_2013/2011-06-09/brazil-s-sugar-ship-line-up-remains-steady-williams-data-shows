The line-up of vessels waiting to
load sugar at  Brazil ’s main ports in the Center South, the
country’s main producing region, climbed by 1 ship, data from
shipping agency Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda. showed.  As many as 68 vessels are lining up at the ports of Santos
and Paranagua to load about 2.22 million metric tons of the
sweetener, according to Williams Brasil data e-mailed today. On
June 1, 67 vessels were queuing up to load 2.245 million tons,
data from the shipping agency showed.  Sugar output in the Center South fell almost 47 percent
from the beginning of the harvest in mid-March to May 16, data
from industry group Unica showed. Production fell because less
cane was crushed, there were lower yields and harvest delays and
more of the raw material was directed to ethanol production.
Brazil’s is the world’s largest producer of sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
