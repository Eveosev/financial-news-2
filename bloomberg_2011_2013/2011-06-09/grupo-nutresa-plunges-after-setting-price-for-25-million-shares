Grupo Nutresa SA,  Colombia ’s biggest
food producer, fell the most in five years after the company
said it will sell 25 million shares at 20,900 pesos each,
according to a regulatory filing.  Nutresa fell 6.9 percent to 23,300 pesos at 11:28 a.m. New
York time, after earlier plunging 10 percent, the most intraday
since May 2006.  “At this price it’s probably a good investment for a lot
of people,” said  Andres Jimenez , head of international sales
for Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest brokerage.  The company has said it plans to begin offering the shares
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
