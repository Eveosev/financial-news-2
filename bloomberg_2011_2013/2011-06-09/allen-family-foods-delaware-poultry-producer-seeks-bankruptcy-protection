Allen Family Foods Inc., a chicken
producer based in Seaford,  Delaware , filed for bankruptcy
protection citing changes in the market for poultry.  The company listed both assets and debt in the range of $50
million to $100 million in Chapter 11 documents filed today in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Affiliates
Allen’s Hatchery and JCR Enterprises also sought protection.  “A recent lag in the industry market has forced the
company to reposition the business by reducing volume and
diversifying its product line,” Vice President of Finance Brian
Hildreth said in court papers.  Allen Family, founded in 1919, processes about 2 million
birds and packs about 8 million pounds of poultry products a
week. The company employs 2,273 people at locations in Delaware,
Maryland and  North Carolina , court papers show.  The case is In re Allen Family Foods Inc., 11-11764,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
