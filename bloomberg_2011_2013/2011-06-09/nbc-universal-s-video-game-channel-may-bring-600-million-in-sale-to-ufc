NBC Universal ’s G4 channel may fetch
as much as $600 million in a sale to Ultimate Fighting
Championship, according to analysts including David Joyce of
Miller Tabak & Co.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC Universal is in talks to sell the
video-game channel to UFC, the mixed-martial-arts fighting
league, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.
G4 reaches 60 million U.S. homes, and may command $5 to $10 per
home in a sale, Joyce said. David Bank, an analyst with RBC
Capital Markets, gave the same estimate.  Negotiations are early and a deal may not be reached, said
the people, who aren’t authorized to speak publicly. Ultimate
Fighting Championship’s contract with  Viacom Inc. (VIA/B) ’s Spike TV
ends this year, one of the people said. More broadly distributed
cable channels with bigger advertising revenue can fetch as much
as $20 per subscriber, Joyce said.  Amelia Stewart, a spokeswoman for New York-based NBC
Universal, declined to comment, as did Caren Bell, a spokeswoman
for Las Vegas-based UFC, which is controlled by Lorenzo and
Frank Fertitta.  The discussions were reported yesterday by the the Wall
Street Journal. UFC may seek only to buy control of the network,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources.  Comcast, which acquired control of NBC Universal in January
from  General Electric Co. (GE) , gained 19 cents to $24.31 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares had
climbed 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
