OAO NLMK, the steelmaker owned by
 Russia â€™s richest man, beat analyst estimates by almost tripling
profit in the first quarter, and forecast further sales growth.  Net income rose to $392 million, from $132 million a year
earlier, the company said a statement today. The result beat the
average $366 million estimate of seven analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Sales increased 39 percent to $2.36 billion.  NLMK, chaired by owner  Vladimir Lisin , said sales will grow
5 percent to 10 percent during the second quarter. The margin on
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
may be 25 to 30 percent, it said, compared with 25 percent in
the prior three months. First-quarter Ebitda was $585 million.  The company was the only Russian steelmaker to receive an
investment grade, of BBB-, from Fitch Ratings Ltd. last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
