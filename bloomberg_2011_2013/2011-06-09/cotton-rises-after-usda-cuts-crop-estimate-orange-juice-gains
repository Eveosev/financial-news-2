Cotton climbed the most in more than
a week after the government said output will drop more than
forecast in the U.S., the world’s top shipper.  Orange juice  also
gained.  Cotton production will fall to 17 million bales, compared
with 18 million estimated a month ago, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today. Six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
forecast 17.38 million bales. Crops in Texas, the biggest
producing state, are suffering after the driest May since 1956,
according to an agricultural program at Texas A&M University in
 College Station .  “It’s a very reasonable downward estimate,” said Chris Kramedjian, a risk-management consultant at FCStone Fibers &
Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee.  Cotton for December delivery rose 2.84 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $1.3299 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , the
biggest gain since May 31.  Today was the first time the government lowered its June
production outlook from May since 1998, which was “also a
severe drought year,” said  Sharon Johnson , a senior analyst at
Penson Futures in Atlanta.  “It suggests to me there will be additional cuts over
time,” Johnson said.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery rose 1.7 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $1.837 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
