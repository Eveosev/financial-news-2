Egypt â€™s natural-gas deliveries to
Jordan are due to resume next week about a month after an
explosion on the Egyptian pipeline network, the Jordan Times
said, citing Energy Minister Khalid Touqan.  The halt to Egyptian gas shipments twice this year after
sabotage attacks on the network has prompted Jordan to explore
the import of liquefied natural gas and the installation of an
offshore gas terminal in the southern Red Sea port of Aqaba,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
