Colombia ’s Congress passed a law to
modify distribution of taxes on commodities to allow a greater
swathe of the nation to benefit from rising revenue.  The law enables provinces that don’t produce oil and coal
to receive more funding for investments, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry told reporters today in Bogota.  Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  said after taking
office last year that the change will help the  government 
finance construction of roads, ports and technology projects and
accumulate savings. Colombia is South America’s largest producer
of coal and its third-largest supplier of oil.  The government will earmark 10 percent of the  tax revenue 
for technology and innovation projects, Santos said in May.  Government inroads against guerrilla groups have improved
security in the Andean nation, luring investors including
billionaires  Eike Batista  and Carlos Slim, whose Grupo Carso SAB
stepped into Colombian oil exploration this year.  Colombia may produce 1.7 million barrels of crude and
natural gas a day in 2020, “closing in” on Brazil, South
America’s second-largest producer after Venezuela, Energy and
Mines Minister Carlos Rodado said in an interview in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
