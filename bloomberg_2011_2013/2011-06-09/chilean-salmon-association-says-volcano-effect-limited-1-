Chile’s salmon farms have suffered
only “limited” effects from the eruption of a volcano in the
country’s south, industry association SalmonChile said.  Salmon farmers  Marine Harvest ASA (MHG) , Salmones Ventisqueros
and Congelados Pacifico moved stock to safer areas after the
Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex erupted on June 4, the
association said. Farmer Salmones Cupquelan reported the loss of
4.5 million newly-hatched salmon and trout, SalmonChile said.  Ash from the volcanic complex, which previously erupted in
1921-22 and 1960, has extended over miles this week, grounding
flights in neighboring Argentina and Uruguay and forcing the
evacuation of thousands of local residents. Chile estimates
volcanic activity could last another 10 days, Mining and Energy
Minister  Laurence Golborne  told reporters in  New York  yesterday.  “Damage produced by the eruption of the Puyehue volcano
won’t have a major impact in the industry’s global results or in
short and mid-term projections,” SalmonChile said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
