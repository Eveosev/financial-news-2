African nation rallied 1.25 shillings, or 5 percent, to 26.25
shillings, the biggest advance since April 5. Oil rose for a

than analysts forecast.  Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. (USCP KN), a Kenyan retailer that
resumed trading in late May after a five-year suspension due to
bankruptcy, climbed 1 shilling, or 9.8 percent, to a one-week
high of 11.25 shillings. The company trades at a multiple of 4.8
times reported earnings per share, compared with 14.7 times
reported profit for the MSCI Frontier Markets index.  “There is a bit of bargain buying after it hit 10
shillings,” George Bodo, an analyst with Nairobi-based Genghis
Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “The price surge
is short term because price discovery is not yet over and we
will see a bit of volatility.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
