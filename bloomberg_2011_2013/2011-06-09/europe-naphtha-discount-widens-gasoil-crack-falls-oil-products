ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc bought ultra-low-sulfur diesel cargoes in northwest  Europe .
Gasoil gained on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
fuel’s crack shrank.  Naphtha’s discount to  Brent crude  widened to the most since
January 2009 partly as refineries in the Middle East resume
output after repairs. Gasoline barge prices were little changed.  Light Products  Naphtha’s discount to Brent increased to $9.15 a barrel
from $8.75 yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., an
oil and refined products broker in London. That’s the biggest
gap since January 2009.  “Refineries in Saudi are starting so that increases
supply,”  Christophe Barret , a London-based oil analyst at
Credit Agricole SA, said by phone.  Gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded at $1,031 to $1,040 a metric ton, according to a
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That compares with yesterday’s deals from $1,032 to
$1,035 a ton.  Total SA and Shell were the buyers. BP Plc and Chevron
Corp. were the main sellers. The trades are for Eurobob grade,
to which ethanol is added to make finished motor fuel, and are
typically for lots of 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack fell to $5.18 a barrel compared with $5.57
yesterday, according to PVM. That’s the lowest since March 18.  Middle Distillates  Shell purchased about 20,000 tons of diesel from BP at a
premium of $38 a ton to June ICE gasoil, according to a survey
of brokers and traders monitoring the Platts pricing window
which ends at 4:30 p.m. in  London . Yesterday, a cargo changed
hands at $32 above June gasoil. ConocoPhillips bought 10,000
tons at $34 a ton more than July ICE gasoil, the survey showed.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges traded at a premium of $25 a
ton to June ICE gasoil and at $21 and $22 a ton to the July
gasoil contract, the survey showed.  Gasoil for June gained 1.2 percent to $982.50 a ton as of
5:07 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The contract expires
tomorrow. The more actively traded July futures rose 1.4 percent
to $988 a ton.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profitability, shrank
to $12.93 a barrel at 4:30 p.m. London time compared with $12.99
at the same time yesterday, according to ICE data. Brent for
July settlement increased 1.4 percent to $119.48 a barrel.  Gasoil barges traded at discounts of $4 and $5 a ton to
June ICE gasoil, the survey of Platts showed. That compares with
yesterday’s trades from $1 to $3 below the gasoil futures
contract. Deals were also concluded at $7 to $8 a ton to July
ICE gasoil, according to today’s survey.  Refineries  Repsol YPF SA,  Spain ’s largest oil company, is restarting a
visbreaker unit at its Petronor refinery in Bilbao after planned
maintenance, according to a statement on the refinery’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
