German states’ broad powers over
health and safety may have slowed response to the E. coli
outbreak, with no single federal agency responsible for tracking
the bug and assigning the blame.  German officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of
the infection as the number of deaths rose to 27, and were
criticized for delays as well as targeting Spanish cucumbers and
organic sprouts not yet proven to be the culprits. At least
2,899 people have been stricken since May 2, with most of the
cases in or tied to northern  Germany , the  European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control  said today.  The decentralized system may have compounded a lack of
leadership, Baerbel Hoehn, a Green Party member and environment
minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, told the N24
television channel yesterday. Each of the 16 states is
responsible for tracking cases inside their borders. Federal
authorities give advice to the states and to consumers.  “Clearly a more centralized structure is probably better
suited to handle this,” Joerg F. Debatin, the medical director
of the  University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf , the biggest
hospital in the area affected worst by the disease, said in an
interview yesterday. “But that really goes down to the roots of
what the German political system is made up of.”  German states run their own police forces and education and
health systems. The federal powers led to conflicts in recent
years on issues from drives to introduce smoking bans to efforts
to harmonize admissions procedures for universities.  Consumer Protection  Imposed after World War II, the system was modeled on the
U.S. federal structure in part as a bulwark against centralized
political power like that of the Nazi regime.  In the case of the E. coli outbreak, decentralization means
officials from each state only asked for help from the  Robert
Koch Institute , Germany’s disease-control agency, after
establishing that people were getting sick. Institute
investigators make non-binding recommendations, which states
usually follow, Ina Klaus, a Health Ministry spokeswoman, said
in a phone interview yesterday.  Then another federal agency, the institute for  risk
assessment , tells consumers what they should do to protect
themselves. That agency was split from the health ministry more
than a decade ago, Klaus said.  There’s no reason to change the structure in Germany,
Health Minister Daniel Bahr said at a news conference in Berlin
yesterday. Instead, cooperation between the agencies is
important, he said.  “In a choir there are many voices, and nevertheless
there’s harmony,” Bahr said.  Harmony, Cacophony  For those following the epidemic, harmony sometimes sounded
like cacophony. State health and agricultural ministers called
their own press conferences. Individual states sent out their
own updates about the number of infections and deaths. Figures
reported in local media, tallying the states’ numbers, were
often higher than the Koch Institute’s total.  Authorities in the city-state of Hamburg initially blamed
Spanish cucumbers. On June 5, officials from the state of Lower
Saxony said sprouts from an organic farm in their region played
a role in the outbreak. Tests from the sprout farm aren’t
complete, though so far show no evidence of the bacteria.  Officials at the Berlin-based Koch institute declined to
comment on whether health authorities may have acted more
quickly under a more centralized system.  “We are well networked with the state health authorities,
and it always depends on someone on location being watchful,”
Susanne Glasmacher, an institute spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  U.S. System  As in Germany, the U.S. system dictates that state and
local authorities take the lead responding to disease outbreaks
and investigating their causes, said Patricia Quinlisk, the
state epidemiologist and medical director of the Iowa Department
of Public Health in  Des Moines . State and federal public health
officials closely collaborate, which prevents them from working
at cross purposes, she said.          “There’s not an artificial
barrier between the two,” Quinlisk she today in a telephone
interview. “We’re a community of scientists,” she said.  U.S. health authorities grappled with a similar E. coli
outbreak in 2006 that killed three people and sickened at least
205. They identified spinach from a California farm as the
source due to close cooperation between the lead federal agency,
the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
and state health officials, said Patrick Kennelly, chief of the
California Department of  Public Health ’s food safety section.  Exchanging Information  The CDC collected data from all affected states and
convened telephone conference calls almost daily with health
officials in those states, Kennelly said.  “It was a team effort,” he said yesterday in a telephone
interview. “We’d share information and knowledge, draw
conclusions, then go back out in the field out and get
clarifying information, more cases, more isolates from labs.”  While the U.S. public-health system is fragmented,
centralizing control wouldn’t lead to a more rapid response to a
future outbreak, said Georges Benjamin, the executive director
of the American Public Health Association in  Washington .  A single national agency “would be so large that it would
still be segmented,” said Benjamin, who is a former head of the
health agencies in  Maryland  and the  District of Columbia .  Australian Experience  In  Australia , where health is predominantly a state
responsibility, nationwide networks facilitate the sharing of
laboratory data and information on communicable diseases, said
John Mackenzie, a Melbourne-based microbiologist who chaired the
 World Health Organization ’s emergency pandemic flu committee and
who advises governments on outbreaks.  “All the health departments meet on a regular basis and
whenever there is a problem, it’s known about very rapidly,”
Mackenzie said in a telephone interview today. “A committee
that keeps all the health departments in constant contact at
different levels is really very important, and this process
certainly does that.”  The strain of E. coli in this outbreak produces a toxin
that attacks the kidneys and blood vessels and can lead to a
potentially fatal complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome.  Different definitions for when patients got sick have made
it more difficult to track the outbreak, said Michael Osterholm,
director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and
Policy at the  University of Minnesota , in an interview.  Cross Purposes  “That shows the difficulties in the federal system, where
the states don’t want to collaborate with the center,” said
David Heymann, chairman of the U.K.’s Health Protection Agency
and a former WHO assistant director-general for health security
and environment.  If infections have stopped and new cases are being reported
only in patients who picked up the bug weeks ago, the threat may
be diminishing, Heymann said in a telephone interview from
 London  yesterday.  “It could be that you will never find the source and the
epidemic is on the downstream,” he said.  Officials in Germany reiterated that people shouldn’t eat
lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and salad ingredients such as
vegetable sprouts. Lower Saxony still sees a connection between
the outbreak and the sprout farm in the town of Bienenbuettel,
state Agriculture Minister Gert Lindemann told N24 in an
interview.  More Deaths  The number of reported deaths increased by two from
yesterday, while cases of E. coli sickness rose by 156,
according to ECDC statistics. Still, many of the new cases may
be old sicknesses that are only now being confirmed in
laboratories, according to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s
disease-control agency. Data from routine surveillance in
emergency rooms suggests a decrease in the number of newly ill
people, the ECDC said.  In Hamburg, there were 27 new cases of E. coli in the past
day, compared with 30 the previous day and 49 the day before
that, authorities said in a statement today.  “The hope that we really have reached the peak increases
every day,” said Cornelia Pruefer-Storcks, Hamburg’s senator
for health.  Germany may review its response after the outbreak to
determine what could be improved, though there’s no need to
change the structure of the existing system, Stefan Gruettner,
social minister of the state of Hesse and chairman of a meeting
of health ministers from the 16 states, said in an interview.  “We don’t need centralism,” Gruettner said. “Everything
went well.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
