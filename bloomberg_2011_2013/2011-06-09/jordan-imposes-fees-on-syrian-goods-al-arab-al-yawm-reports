Jordan reacted to Syrian measures by
imposing fees on trucks and goods entering the kingdom at the
Jaber border crossing,  Al Arab Al Yawm  newspaper said.  The move came in response to  Syria â€™s levying of fees on
Jordanian trucks, though the vehicles and cargo should be exempt
from the charges under agreements between the two countries, the
newspaper said without saying where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
