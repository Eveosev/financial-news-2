The first hurricane of the U.S.
season, Adrian, formed today off the west coast of  Mexico .  The storm, with maximum winds of 75 miles per hour (121
kilometers per hour), is moving northwest at about 9 mph,
according to the U.S.  National Hurricane Center . It is 265 miles
south-southwest of  Acapulco , Mexico, the center said in a
statement released at about 5 p.m.  Los Angeles  time.  “A gradual turn toward the west-northwest is expected over
the next couple of days,” the center said. “The center of the
storm is expected to remain offshore of the coast of Mexico.
However, any deviation to the right of the forecast track could
bring tropical storm conditions to the coast.”  A tropical storm watch extends from Acapulco westward to
Punta San Telmo, meaning winds of at least 39 mph are possible
within 48 hours, according to the hurricane center. Adrian
reached hurricane status when winds hit 74 mph.  Tropical storm force winds extend 85 miles from Adrian’s
center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
