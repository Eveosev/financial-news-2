New Zealand ’s dollar was 0.4 percent
from a record high against the greenback after data showed today
 China ’s imports gained more than economists had expected,
boosting prospects for the South Pacific nation’s exports.
　　The so-called kiwi headed for a weekly gain against all of
its 16 major counterparts after the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand
said yesterday commodity prices remain “very strong” and
 interest rates  will rise within two years. The Australian dollar
rebounded from a two-week low versus the greenback as China’s
trade data for May along with gains in commodities and stocks
supported demand for currencies linked to growth.
　　“It’s important to notice China’s imports are rising
because it’s definitely a good sign,” said  Thomas Harr , head of
Asian foreign-exchange strategy at Standard Chartered Plc in
 Singapore . The data are “modestly positive for commodity
currencies.”
　　New Zealand’s dollar traded at 82.66 U.S. cents at 1:46 p.m.
in Sydney from 82.48 in  New York  yesterday, when it touched a
record 83.02. It fetched 66.19 yen from 66.28. The kiwi was at
NZ$1.2861 per Australian dollar from NZ$1.2883 yesterday, when
it touched NZ$1.2809, the strongest since Jan. 28.

reaching $1.0563 yesterday, the weakest since May 26. The
currency fell to 85.15 yen from 85.40.
　　China’s trade surplus rose to $13.05 billion in May from
$11.42 billion in April, as imports increased 28.4 percent and
exports gained 19.4 percent last month from a year earlier, the
government reported today. Economists had forecast a 22 percent
increase in imports.  Stocks, Commodities Rise  　　The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares gained 0.2
percent. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
advanced 0.7 percent yesterday.
　　Rallies in commodities and equities helped the  New Zealand
dollar  "catapult to new post-float highs,’’ David Croy, an
interest-rate strategist at ANZ National Bank Ltd. in
Wellington, wrote in a research note today. “Tentative
speculators and importer demand should help subdue further moves
to the upside today, however they can not be ruled out as
bullish sentiment remains rife.”
　　The Reserve Bank of New Zealand yesterday left its official
cash rate unchanged at a record-low 2.5 percent. Australia’s
central bank kept the key rate at 4.75 percent on June 7 and
said current policy settings are appropriate.
