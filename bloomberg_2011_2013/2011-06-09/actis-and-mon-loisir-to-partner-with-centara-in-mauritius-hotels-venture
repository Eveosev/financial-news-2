Actis LLP, a London-based private
equity company, and Groupe Mon Loisir, a Mauritian investment
holding company, plan to form a partnership with Centara Hotels
& Resorts of  Thailand  to build two hotels in Mauritius.  Indian Ocean Real Estate Co., a joint venture between Actis
and Groupe Mon Loisir, will invest 1.5 billion rupees ($54
million) in the Centara hotels to help attract Asian tourists,
Murray Adair, the Port Louis-based company’s chief executive
officer, said in an e-mailed response to questions on June 7.
The 98-room Centara Poste La Fayette, one of the planned hotels,
will probably open toward the end of 2012, he said.  Centara “are firmly center stage in tapping the highly
lucrative Asian market that many hotel operators desire to
reach,” Adair said.  Tourist arrivals to Mauritius from Asia surged 29 percent
in the first quarter, led by India and  China , while arrivals
from  Europe , the biggest source of visitors, rose 2.3 percent,
according to the country’s statistics office. Tourism is the one
of the country’s main sources of foreign currency, with revenue
expected to rise 7.7 percent to 42.5 billion rupees in 2011, the
statistics office said on Feb. 25.  Air Mauritius Ltd., sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth largest
airline, will operate weekly flights to Shanghai from next month
with a stop-over in  Kuala Lumpur , the government said on May 27.
A direct weekly flight is scheduled for February 2012, rising to
two in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
