South Korea ’s bank lending to
households rose the most in six months in May as  interest rates 
lagging behind inflation encouraged people to borrow.  Lending to households increased by 3.3 trillion won ($3
billion) last month to a record 439.8 trillion won, the  Bank of
Korea  said in an e-mailed statement today. It was the fourth
straight month that loans rose to all-time highs.  South Korea’s swelling household debt may complicate the
central bank’s policymaking as board members seek to quell
inflation without exacerbating the burden on indebted consumers.
The Bank of Korea may hold the benchmark interest rate tomorrow
due to risks to growth, nine of 17 economists said in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The remaining eight surveyed expect the bank to raise the
rate to 3.25 percent from 3 percent, citing the build-up in
underlying inflation pressures as consumer prices exceeded the
bank’s 4 percent target ceiling each month this year. The rate
decision will be announced at around 9:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Seoul .  Mortgage lending rose 1.4 trillion won to 293.7 trillion
won, today’s report showed. Loans to companies increased 4.4
trillion won to 543.1 trillion won.  The broadest measure of  money supply , M2, gained 3.9
percent in April from a year earlier, according to a separate
central bank statement. The gauge rose 4.3 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
