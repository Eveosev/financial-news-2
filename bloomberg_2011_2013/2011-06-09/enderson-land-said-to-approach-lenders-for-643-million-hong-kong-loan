Henderson Land Development Co., the
 Hong Kong  builder controlled by tycoon Lee Shau-kee, has
approached banks for a HK$5 billion ($642.5 million) five-year
 term loan , according to two people familiar with the matter.  Lenders committing HK$1 billion or more will receive
interest and fees for a total payment of 96.5 basis points more
than the Hong Kong interbank offered rate while those
contributing HK$500 million up to HK$1 billion will receive a
so-called all-in payment of 95 basis points, the people said.  Lending curbs in  China  are forcing more companies to borrow
in Hong Kong, which is increasing the cost of loans as borrowers
jostle for banks’ business. Henderson borrowed HK$13.25 billion
for five years in June last year, after initially seeking HK$8
billion, and paid a little under 90 basis points more than
Hibor, according to the people familiar with the matter and data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company has HK$49.6 billion in loans
maturing before the end of 2015, Bloomberg data show.  The HK$5 billion facility is also likely to be increased,
the people said, without elaborating. Proceeds will be used to
refinance debt and the loan is expected to be split 30 percent
and 70 percent between a term and a revolver, the people said.  Banks expected to participate include Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Citigroup Inc., Credit Agricole CIB, DBS
Group Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc, Standard Chartered Plc,
and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., the people said.  In a revolving credit facility money that’s been repaid can
be borrowed again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
