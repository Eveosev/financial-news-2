The  California Public Utilities
Commission  on a 3-2 vote opened an investigation of  AT&T Inc. (T) ’s
proposed purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc.  The deal would create a company with 47 percent of the
state’s wireless market, the agency said in a news release. The
hearings’ record would be shared with U.S. officials reviewing
the purchase, the agency said.  AT&T on March 20 proposed buying  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-
Mobile in a $39 billion deal that would join the second- and
fourth-largest carriers to create a new market leader, ahead of
No. 1 Verizon Wireless.  “We look forward to working with the commission,” Lane
Kasselman, an AT&T spokesman, said in an e-mail. “We’re
confident in the merits and that regulatory approvals will be
obtained.”  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-largest U.S. wireless
carrier and an opponent of the deal, asked the California agency
on May 19 to open a review.  On May 17, the Louisiana Public Service Commission voted to
open an inquiry.  The purchase needs approval from two U.S. agencies, the
 Justice Department  and the Federal Communications Commission.  The California commission can’t order companies to give up
airwaves or customers, Christopher Chow, a public information
officer for the agency, said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
