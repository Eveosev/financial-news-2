The Lithuanian parliament raised the
 retirement age  to 65 as the government aims to narrow the  budget
deficit  amid an aging population.  Lawmakers voted 60 to 42, with 12 abstentions, to support
the measure, according to the  parliament’s website.   The pension overhaul will raise the retirement age for
both men and women to 65, with gradual increases starting next
year and ending in 2026. Women currently receive a full state
pension if they retire at 60, while men qualify at 62 1/2.  Lithuania, a nation of 3 million people, needs to cut its
budget deficit to less than 3 percent of gross domestic product
next year to meet European Union rules. This year’s shortfall is
estimated at 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
