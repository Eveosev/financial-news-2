(Corrects to say margin requirement raised to 100 percent.)  Interactive Brokers Group Inc. (IBKR) 
increased margin requirements to 100 percent for some Chinese
stocks because of “elevated risk concerns,” according to a
statement on its website.  The increase went into effect Jun. 6 in stages and will be
completed by the end of this week, the brokerage said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
