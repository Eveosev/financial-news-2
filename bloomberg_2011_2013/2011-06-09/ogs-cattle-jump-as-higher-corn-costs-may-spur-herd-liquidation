Hog futures jumped to a three-week
high and cattle gained on speculation that rising corn costs
will discourage U.S. producers from expanding herds, tightening
supplies to meat processors.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  today cut its forecast
for domestic corn  supplies  as wet weather delayed planting. The
price of corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed, climbed to
a three-year high. Costlier feed may spur producers to sell
animals to meatpackers at lower weights. Lighter livestock yield
less beef and pork.  “There’s less incentive to expand, and down the road, it
could lead to lighter weights,” said Chad Henderson, a market
analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
 Wisconsin . Livestock prices rose because “the job of the market
is to dangle a carrot out there and give producers the incentive
to stay in production,” he said.  Hog futures for July settlement climbed 1.625 cents, or 1.8
percent, to close at 92.975 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the commodity reached 93.8
cents, the highest since May 16. The price has gained 16 percent
in the past year.  Hog farmers are facing record production costs, based on
current futures prices, Steve Meyer, the president of Paragon
Economics, said yesterday at the World Pork Expo in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa .  Cattle futures for August delivery gained 0.875 cent, or
0.8 percent, to $1.05425 a pound. Earlier, the price reached
$1.0655, the highest since May 20. The commodity has climbed 21
percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.525
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $1.25325 a pound.  Today, the USDA cut its forecast for 2012 domestic beef
production by 0.3 percent to 25.115 billion pounds from last
month. The agency boosted its projection for exports by 2.7
percent to 2.515 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
