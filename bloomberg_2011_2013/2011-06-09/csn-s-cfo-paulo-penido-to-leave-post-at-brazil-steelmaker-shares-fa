Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA,
 Brazil ’s third-largest steelmaker, named Treasury Director
Alberto Monteiro acting chief financial officer after Paulo Penido Marques resigned. Shares fell to their lowest level in
more than two years.  Monteiro, 43, will replace Penido starting today until CSN,
as the Rio de Janeiro-based steelmaker is known, appoints a
permanent replacement, a spokesman for the company said in a
phone interview. Penido, who worked at CSN for about two years,
left the company because of personal reasons, the spokesman
said, declining to be identified citing corporate policy.  Monteiro has been CSN’s treasury director since August
2009, according to the company’s  website . Before that, he held
several positions at Banco do Brasil SA,  Latin America ’s largest
lender by assets.  Penido, 53, is leaving to become chief executive officer of
a company in Brazil that isn’t linked to the  steel industry , Sao
Paulo-based newspaper Valor Economico said. Valor reported the
executive’s resignation earlier  today , citing unidentified
people in the industry.  CSN dropped 53 centavos, or 2.6 percent, to 19.81 reais in
Sao Paulo trading at 5:12 p.m. after falling as much as 3.4
percent to its lowest level since April 2009. The stock has
dropped about 26 percent so far this year, more than the 8.4
percent drop in the benchmark Bovespa Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
