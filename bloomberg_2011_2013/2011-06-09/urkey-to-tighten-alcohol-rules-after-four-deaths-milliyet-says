Turkey  will tighten its certification
and inspection regime for alcohol importers after four Russian
visitors died and 15 others were hospitalized due to poisoning
by counterfeit alcohol served on a cruise,  Milliyet  reported.  Officials from the culture, agriculture and transportation
ministries met with alcohol and tobacco regulators in Ankara to
draw up a series of new rules in response to the deaths,
Milliyet said, citing Ozgur Ozaslan, an official with the
Culture Ministry.  The regulations include stricter conditions for granting
import licenses and a new system to track imported alcohol,
Milliyet said.  Police seized 42,900 bottles of counterfeit alcohol in
synchronized raids in 16 provinces, Milliyet said without giving
more details. The deaths of the four Russians were linked to
counterfeit alcohol imported from Turkish northern Cyprus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
