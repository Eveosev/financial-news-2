Last week’s ruling by the  European Court  of Human Rights that former Yukos CEO  Mikhail Khodorkovsky  and his business partner  Platon Lebedev  are not political prisoners was a major public relations triumph for Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin .  There is now speculation that Putin might crown his triumph with a display of magnanimity, releasing Khodorkovsky and Lebedev from jail before their sentences are up in 2016. Vladimir Frolov in the English-language  Moscow Times   opines that: As so often turns out to be the case in Russian politics these days, all benefits would accrue to Putin, while any risks would be borne by President  Dmitry Medvedev  alone. Here's Frolov again: As Russia’s presidential election, scheduled for March 2012, draws near, it's still unclear which of the dyarchy’s members, Putin or Medvedev, will run for the top job of president. In a  ZhivoyZhurnal  blog post, Stas Kucher concludes that Medvedev is “finished as president.” Kucher: Medvedev, who last month had his first major presidential press conference after three years in office, remains silent. “I have the feeling,” Kucher adds, “that the president is of his own accord extinguishing himself and his image. Like an actor who has finished his role and understand it’s time to withdraw behind the stage curtains.” Some 450 organizations and at least one celebrity, former chess champion Anatoli Karpov, have already joined Putin’s Popular Front, reports  Gazeta.ru . Putin, meanwhile, is maintaining an air of mystery about his political ambitions, spritzed with a dash of regal aloofness.  RBCDaily.ru  and  KP.ru   reported on his recent visit with volunteers (and the musical group Murzilki International) who were on the Black Sea coast to clean up ski slopes in advance of the 2014 Olympics near Sochi. After being greeted by an impromptu chorus of the Russian pop hit, “I’ve really been looking forward to seeing you, Vova!” -- Vova being the affectionate diminutive of Vladimir -- Putin was grilled by the students on a wide range of contentious issues. His fitness regimen, for example. “How do you keep yourself in such good shape?" A female admirer asked him. "The country should follow your example!” Putin warmed to the task: After Putin sang a Soviet-era pop classic, “We Didn’t Make Up This World," he was tossed another hot potato: “You work like a galley slave,” one of the volunteers told him. “I just feel terrible for you . . . You need to spend time with your family.” Putin seized the opportunity to drop a hint about his intentions. “So, I see you’re sending me into retirement," he said. "Even if you consider my age, it’s too early.” Putin may not be getting any younger, but his image of masculine virility is well-crafted and appears durable for at least another election. It might nonetheless face a compelling test one day, especially if a particularly alluring opponent challenges him for president. One person of interest is none other than Anna Chapman, the femme fatale expelled from the U.S. in 2010 as part of a spy-swap deal. This isn’t quite as improbable as it sounds -- if not for 2012 then for the campaign of 2018. Famously exposed by her British ex-husband as an aficionada of both power and erotic toys, Chapman has recently augmented her political profile by appealing for calm after December riots in Moscow and by landing a seat on the public council of United Russia’s Young Guard. In his article “Is Russia Ready for a Female President?” Tom  Washington  of the  Moscow News  weighs the prospects: Washington goes on to profile the potential female contenders: Elena Nabiullina, since 2007 Minister of  Economic Development  – “a traditionally macho sphere of government.” Ksenya Sobchak, an “it-girl, presenter on Dom 2, Russia’s Big Brother, and a professional crooner.” And, of course, the pièce de résistance, Anna Chapman, who possesses: Faced with a contest pitting former spymaster Putin's machismo against former spy Chapman’s polymorphous “versatility,” Russian voters could be forgiven for blushing.
