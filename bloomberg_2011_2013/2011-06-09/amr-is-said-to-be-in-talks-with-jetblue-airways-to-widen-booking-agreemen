American Airlines  and  JetBlue Airways
Corp. (JBLU)  are in talks to add more cities outside the U.S. to their
joint booking and frequent-flier agreement, two people familiar
with the discussions said.  An expanded accord would help  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s American fill
more seats on international flights from New York and Boston,
and let JetBlue win domestic passengers by offering destinations
it can’t reach with its own planes, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the discussions are private.  New York is home to JetBlue’s headquarters and biggest base
and American’s chief East Coast hub for trans-Atlantic flights.
American is fighting for market share there after being eclipsed
by the merger of United and Continental airlines and  Delta Air
Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s purchase of  Northwest Airlines .  “If they want to be a bigger player, they are going to
need more presence and more feed,” said James M. Higgins, an
analyst with New York-based Ticonderoga Securities LLC.
“JetBlue is a way to get that.”  There is no timeline for  Fort Worth , Texas-based American
and JetBlue to decide on broadening their 15-month-old interline
agreement, the people said.  The existing accord lets each airline sell tickets on
specific partner flights and check bags on a full itinerary,
with the revenue going to the flight’s operator. JetBlue
travelers can book on American to 15 foreign cities from New
York and Boston, while fliers to the two destinations on
American jets from abroad can reach 26 U.S. cities via JetBlue.  JetBlue’s Interest  While those JetBlue airports aren’t in competition with
markets served by American, JetBlue would like to expand the
relationship to cities where the carriers do compete, one of the
people said. JetBlue’s main U.S. airport is  New York ’s Kennedy,
where American serves destinations such as London and Paris.  Spokesmen for American and JetBlue declined to comment on
the talks.  “American and JetBlue continue to explore opportunities to
expand commercial cooperation where it makes sense for both
airlines,” American’s Sean Collins said. Alison Croyle, a
JetBlue spokeswoman, said the airline would like to add more
cities outside the U.S. to the agreement.  Deeper ties between the carriers may lead to an eventual
merger, possibly in about two years, said Ticonderoga’s Higgins,
who recommends buying JetBlue and holding AMR.  ‘Further Cooperation’  “It definitely furthers cooperation between them,”
Higgins said of the current discussions. “If the benefits to
AMR of the JetBlue tie-up are as good as I think they’ll be, I
also believe it increases the odds there may be a merger down
the road.”  The challenge for American is to first resolve contract
talks with its three largest  unions , Higgins said. The current
labor negotiations date back as far as September 2006, when
bargaining began with pilots.  American and JetBlue unveiled their accord two months
before United and Continental agreed to the tie-up creating
United Continental Holdings Inc. The new  United Airlines  is the
world’s biggest carrier by traffic, ahead of Delta, which
overtook American with the 2008 Northwest acquisition.  After sitting out consolidation that included those deals
and  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) ’s May 2 purchase of  AirTran Holdings
Inc. (AAI) , AMR is the only large U.S. airline company likely to post
a 2011 loss, based on analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Declining Shares  AMR tumbled 27 percent this year in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading through yesterday, and JetBlue fell 17 percent
on the Nasdaq Stock Market, joining declines for most of the
U.S. industry.  While interline accords are common among U.S. carriers, the
American and JetBlue linkage is unusual because it connects a
carrier that collects travelers at hub airports to one focused
on point-to-point flights. Interline agreements are used in
cases such as an airline scrubbing flights and being unable to
rebook passengers on one of its own planes.  Will Randow, a Citigroup Inc. analyst, expects that the
carriers’ current accord may evolve into a so-called code-share
arrangement, in which airlines agree to share some revenue for
joint bookings, and stop far short of a combination.  Moving JetBlue employees to American’s higher union wage
rates would be too costly and blending different aircraft fleets
would be difficult, said Randow, who has hold ratings on JetBlue
and AMR. JetBlue’s planes are from Airbus SAS and Embraer SA,
while American’s main jet fleet is from  Boeing Co. (BA)   ‘Strong Presence’  “JetBlue’s strong presence at JFK can bolster American’s
position and extend their network, which is a good thing,”
Randow said. “American’s strategic vision is to solidify that
relationship as much as possible.”  JetBlue has 10 interline agreements, two with U.S.-based
carriers. It has two code-share arrangements, including one with
its largest shareholder,  Germany ’s Deutsche Lufthansa AG. The
code shares allow the international partners to put their
designation on certain JetBlue flights.  American also agreed as part of the original accord to give
eight pairs of takeoff and landing rights at  Washington ’s Ronald
 Reagan National  to JetBlue in exchange for 12 pairs at Kennedy.
The trade allowed JetBlue to initiate service at Reagan.  JetBlue has focused over the past two years on building its
network in  Boston  and the Caribbean, markets where American has
reduced service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
