Grocery retailer Haldanes Stores Ltd.
has called in administrators, the  Daily Telegraph  reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Arthur Harris.  The supermarket chain, which has 26 shops in the U.K.,
employs about 600 people, who may lose their jobs, the Telegraph
said. Haldanes was created when it bought stores from the Co-
operative Group Ltd., which disposed of them after acquiring the
Somerfield chain, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
