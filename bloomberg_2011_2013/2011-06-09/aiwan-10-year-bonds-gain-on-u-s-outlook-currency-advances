Taiwan’s 10-year bonds rose for the
first time in four days on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
maintain monetary stimulus to support the  U.S. economy ,
bolstering demand for emerging-market assets.  The island’s 1.75 percent benchmark interest rate compares
with a maximum of 0.25 percent in the U.S. and  Japan . Standard &
Poor’s rates Taiwan’s debt AA-, its fourth-best investment-grade
rating, and the Taiwan dollar is the best performer this year
among Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies with a gain of 5.5
percent. U.S. Treasuries declined on concern investors will
avoid 10-year debt with yields below 3 percent.  “The local bond market is active today because the U.S.
10-year yield fell to 2.96 percent,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-
income trader at First Securities Inc. “America’s economic
environment is still weak and the Fed will probably continue
with its policy of quantitative easing.  Taiwan  bond prices will
go up. They’re very good credits and carry low risk.”  The yield on the 1.375 percent note due March 2021 dropped
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.470 percent
as of the 1:30 p.m. close of trading Taipei, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The rate reached 1.498 percent yesterday, the
highest level since the notes were issued in February.  Taiwan’s dollar fell, reversing an earlier gain of as much
as 0.2 percent, as the benchmark Taiex index of shares declined
for a second day. Overseas investors sold $88 million more
Taiwanese shares than they bought in the first four days of the
week. The currency dropped 0.2 percent to NT$28.78 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
