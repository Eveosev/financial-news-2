Just as economists have debated the causes of the financial crisis, they are now debating the causes of the slow, almost non-existent, recovery. Topping my list of causes are the so-called stimulus packages -- which  empirical   work  shows did little to stimulate -- and other government interventions, which have left an overhang of uncertainty impeding private investment. As my colleagues Gary Becker, George Shultz, Michael Boskin, John Cogan and I  explained last summer : The latest entry in the debate over the anemic recovery comes from  a recent column by Paul Krugman , which Amity Shlaes  responded to earlierÂ this week . He argues that "As the stimulus has faded out, so have hopes of strong economic recovery." With no empirical evidence connecting the weak recovery to a fading-out of stimulus, Krugman appeals to history, and the year 1937 in particular. After three years of strong economic recovery, with real gross-domestic-product growth of more than 10 percent per year, the  U.S. economy  slowed and went into a recession in 1937 and 1938. Krugman says it was a "fiscal and monetary pullback that aborted an ongoing economic recovery" and that the same thing is happening in the U.S. today. The historical analogy to the present is flawed in many ways. First, regarding fiscal policy, the small decline in government purchases couldn't be a significant cause of the large drop in real GDP growth from 1936 to 1938. Thomas F. Cooley and Lee E. Ohanian explained this in  their rebuttal  last year to similar points made by  Christina Romer , then the chair of the President's  Council of Economic Advisers . Here are some numbers: Real GDP growth fell by 16 percentage points from 1936 to 1938 (from an expansion of 13 percent in 1936 to a contraction of 3 percent in 1938). Over the same period, the change in government purchases as a share of GDP fell by 2 percentage points (from 3.5 percent to 1.5 percent). In other words, more than 80 percent of the growth change came from other sources, even taking multiplier effects into account. The other issues stressed by Cooley and Ohanian are the sharp increase in union power, accompanied by several strikes, and the increase in business taxes, for which they cite Ellen McGrattan's finding that increases in capital-income taxation account for "much of the 26 percent decline in business fixed investment that occurred in 1937-1938." Moreover, any reduction in government purchases associated with the fading-out of the 2009 stimulus is tiny in comparison with 1937 because the stimulus didn't increase government purchases in any material way. At most, federal-government purchases rose by only 0.2 percent of GDP as a result of the 2009 stimulus, and data show that state and local governments didn't use stimulus grants to increase purchases. Even the  much-debated deal  on the 2011 budget wasn't able to reduce government discretionary outlays by more than $1 billion this year. So the fading-out of fiscal stimulus can't explain the weak recovery in 2011 -- even if it could explain the decline in 1937, which is unlikely anyway. Then there's monetary policy. Monetary economists from  Milton Friedman  and Anna Schwartz to  Allan Meltzer  have written extensively about the  Federal Reserve 's decision to increase  reserve requirements  in 1937, and they conclude that it was an important cause of the contraction. According to Friedman and Schwartz, monetary-base growth (currency plus reserves) declined from 15 percent in 1936 to 8 percent in 1938. But in the past year the monetary base has shown no slowdown. In fact, monetary-base growth accelerated to 24 percent in the year ending in April from 14 percent a year earlier to finance the second round of quantitative easing. No monetary fade-out there. M2 growth increased to 5 percent from 2 percent. No monetary fade-out there, either. The claim that the anemic recovery is due to a fade-out of monetary or fiscal stimulus isn't consistent with the facts. ( John B.
