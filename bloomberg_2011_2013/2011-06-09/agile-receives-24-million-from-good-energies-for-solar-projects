Agile Energy Inc., a  California  solar
power developer, raised $24 million from Good Energies Capital.  The funding is an extension of Good Energies’ March 2010
Series A investment in Agile, Eric Lundberg, vice-president of
finance at the San Bruno, California-based developer, said in an
e-mail today. Good Energies, the North American development fund
of Zug, Switzerland-based private equity company Good Energies
Inc., has provided a total of $37 million to Agile.  The funding will support projects Agile is developing in
California,  Arizona ,  Ohio ,  Colorado  and  Texas , Lundberg said.
“In the near-term we are heavily focused on the requests for
offers from the California investor-owned utilities,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
