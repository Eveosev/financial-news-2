Serbia offered investors up to 10,000
euros ($14,500) for each job created in 15 underdeveloped parts
of the country as it seeks to revive industrial production.  Expanding a program previously applied to four districts,
the government pledged to subsidize investments of at least
500,000 euros that help create at least 50 jobs in the
industrial sector of the economy. The program aims to jump-start
production in the areas where unemployment exceeds the national
average of 20 percent and which are home to one fifth of the
country’s 7.3 million people, the government said in an e-mailed
statement.  The government also invited investors to apply for support
of up to 5,000 euros for each job they add in other parts of the
country, excluding areas with free trade zones for which the
authorities already allowed tax breaks and lower levies.  Serbia emerged from a recession five quarters ago and is
still struggling to bring industrial output and employment back
to pre-crisis levels. The authorities said they may also
consider subsidizing investments in services, such as
“strategic projects in tourism.”  Since the crisis began, the state has spent 85 million
euros on job-creation subsidies, which helped employ 22,500
people, the government said. More than 200,000 people, or 10
percent of the workforce, lost their jobs during the 2008-2010
global crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
