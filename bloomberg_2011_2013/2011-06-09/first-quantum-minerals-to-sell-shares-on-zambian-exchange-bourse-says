First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  plans to
sell shares on Zambia’s stock exchange as it expands operations
in the southern African nation, said Beatrice Nkanza, the chief
executive officer of the bourse.  “The listing is end of June,” Nkanza said today by phone
from Lusaka, the capital. “The more the demand from the market,
the more shares they will offer.” The Vancouver-based company
planned to start a roadshow on June 13 to test investor appetite
for shares, she said.  First Quantum, seeking to diversify after a battle over
mining rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo, announced in
January it planned to invest more than $1 billion to build the
Trident copper mine and a smelter in Zambia,  Africa ’s biggest
producer of the metal. Its Kansanshi and Kalumbia will produce
700,000 metric tons of copper by 2015, Chief Executive Officer
Philip Pascall said on April 29.  The company will also build a new hydropower station near
the Trident mine to ensure continuous supply of electricity,
according to Pascal.  Copper for delivery in three-months fell 0.7 percent on the
London Metal Exchange to $8,970 a ton by 11 a.m. in
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
