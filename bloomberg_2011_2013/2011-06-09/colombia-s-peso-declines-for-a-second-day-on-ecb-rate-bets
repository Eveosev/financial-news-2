Colombia ’s peso held close to a one-
month high amid gains in oil, the nation’s biggest export, and
bets investment flows into the country will keep growing.  The peso was little changed at 1,770.95 per  U.S. dollar  at
3:31 p.m. New York time. It rose to 1,767.40 on June 7, its
strongest level on a closing basis since May 5. The peso has
jumped 7.7 percent this year, the best performance among the six
most-traded Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The local currency’s strengthening trend will continue amid
rising oil prices, increased foreign direct investment and
higher portfolio inflows after Colombia received a second
investment grade rating last month, said Wilson Tovar, head of
research at brokerage Acciones y Valores SA in Bogota.  “We’re going to continue seeing an inflow of dollars,”
said Tovar, who predicts the peso will end this year at about
1,750.  Colombia was raised to the lowest level of investment grade
by Moody’s Investors Service on May 31. A second investment-
grade rating was needed by either Moody’s or  Fitch Ratings ,
following the upgrade by  Standard & Poor’s  on March 16, for
Colombian assets to be included in most investment-grade
portfolios.  Oil, which accounts for about 40 percent of Colombia’s
exports, has gained 37 percent in the past year.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.94 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The security’s price
fell 0.5 centavo to 116.420 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
