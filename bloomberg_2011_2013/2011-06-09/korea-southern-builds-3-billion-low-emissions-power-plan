Korea Southern Power Co. began
construction of a $3 billion low-emissions power plant in
Samcheok city, southeast of  Seoul , capable of producing 2,000
megawatts of electricity.  The "green-power" plant will use  carbon capture  and storage
technology and "low-calorie" coal, meeting stricter standards on
greenhouse-gas emissions, according to an e-mailed statement
from Knowledge Economy  Ministry , which controls the utility.
Construction will cost 3.2 trillion won ($3 billion) and is set
to be completed by the end of 2015.  Kepco Engineering & Construction Co. was involved in
designing the plant and  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  will supply "ultra-
supercritical" steam turbines, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
