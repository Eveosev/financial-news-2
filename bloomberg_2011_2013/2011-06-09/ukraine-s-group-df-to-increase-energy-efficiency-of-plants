Businessman Dmitry Firtash seeks to
increase  energy efficiency  at his Group DF’s chemical plants in
the Ukraine.  Firtash wants to cut consumption of natural gas and
electricity at nitrogen plants he controls, said Robert Shetler-
Jones, Group DF chief executive officer, according to an e-
mailed statement. The Rivneazot plant has already cut the amount
of gas needed for production of ammonia, he said today. Stirol
aims to cut gas consumption by 30 to 40 cubic meters of gas per
ton of ammonia, he said.  The Group will complete installation of a steam generator
at Rivneazot which will allow the plant to reduce electricity
use by 50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
