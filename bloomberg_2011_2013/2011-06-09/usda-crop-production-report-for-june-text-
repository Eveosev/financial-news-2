Following is the text of the U.S.
Crop Production report for June from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture:  Winter Wheat Production Up 2 Percent from May
Orange Production Unchanged from May  Winter wheat production is forecast at 1.45 billion bushels, up 2 percent
from the May 1 forecast but 2 percent below 2010. Based on June 1 conditions,
the United States yield is forecast at 45.3 bushels per acre, up 0.8 bushel
from last month but 1.5 bushels less than last year. Expected area for
harvest as grain or seed totals 32.0 million acres, unchanged from May1.  Hard Red Winter production, at 777 million bushels, is up 2 percent from a
month ago. Soft Red Winter production is up 2 percent from last month and now
totals 434 million bushels. White Winter production totals 240 million
bushels, up 2 percent from last month. Of this total, 11.6 million bushels
are Hard White and 228 million bushels are Soft White.  The United States all orange forecast for the 2010-2011 season is
8.82 million tons, unchanged from the May 1 forecast but 7 percent above the
2009-2010 final utilization. The Florida all orange forecast, at 140 million
boxes (6.30 million tons), is unchanged from the May 1 forecast but 5 percent
above last season's final utilization. Early, midseason, and navel varieties
in Florida are forecast at 70.0 million boxes (3.15 million tons), unchanged
from May but 2 percent higher than last season. The Florida Valencia orange
forecast, at 70.0 million boxes (3.15 million tons), is unchanged from the
previous forecast but up 8 percent from the 2009-2010 crop. The monthly row
count survey indicated that 79 percent of the Valencia crop has been
harvested. California and Texas production forecasts are carried forward from
April.  Florida frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) yield forecast for the
2010-2011 season is 1.59 gallons per box at 42.0 degrees Brix, up 1 percent
from the May 1 forecast and up 2 percent from last season's final yield of
1.56 gallons per box. The early-midseason portion is final at 1.52 gallons
per box, up 1 percent from last season's yield of 1.51 gallons per box. The
Valencia portion is projected at 1.68 gallons per box, 3 percent higher than
last year's final yield of 1.63 gallons per box. All projections of yield
assume the processing relationships this season will be similar to those of
the past several seasons.  Winter Wheat Area Harvested, Yield, and Production - States and United States:

1/  Production years are 2009-2010 and 2010-2011.  May Weather Summary  Unusually cool weather across the northern Plains and much of the West
contrasted with above-normal temperatures in the South and East. Toward
month's end, an intense, early-season heat wave built across the South, while
favorable warmth overspread the Midwest, while extremely cool weather
persisted in California and neighboring areas.  Incessantly wet conditions accompanied the cool weather across the northern
Plains, slowing winter wheat development, hampering summer crop planting, and
triggering widespread flooding in the middle and upper Missouri Valley. By
June 5, more than one-quarter of the spring wheat had not yet been planted in
North Dakota (69 percent planted) and Montana (73 percent).  In stark contrast, drought worsened across the southern High Plains and the
Deep South. In both regions, dry, increasingly hot weather severely stressed
pastures and rain-fed summer crops. By June 5, at least half of the rangeland
and pastures were rated in very poor to poor condition in every southern-tier
state from Arizona to Florida, excluding Alabama. On the southern Plains,
drought resulted in early maturation of the winter wheat crop and promoted a
rapid harvest pace. Ironically, flood-control efforts extended into
drought-affected areas of the lower Mississippi Valley during May, as water
from the earlier inundation of the Ohio Valley and the Mid-South worked its
way downstream.  Farther north, producers in the eastern Corn Belt and far upper Midwest
continued to battle wetness in an effort to plant corn and soybeans. By
June 5, corn planting was just 58 percent complete in Ohio, while Midwestern
soybean planting had not surpassed the halfway mark in Michigan (50 percent
planted), Indiana (49 percent), North Dakota (47 percent), and Ohio
(26 percent). However, in Midwestern areas where corn and soybeans had
emerged, crops benefited from frequent showers and late-May warmth.  Elsewhere, cool, showery weather in California, the Great Basin, and the
Northwest slowed fieldwork and crop development. Chilly conditions also
delayed the Western melt season, leaving substantial high-elevation snow
still on the ground by month's end - except in drought-affected areas of the
Southwest.  May Agricultural Summary  Unusually cool temperatures blanketed much of the western half the United
States during May, delaying fieldwork and slowing the emergence and
development of some small grains and row crops. Most notably, average
temperatures in portions of the Pacific Northwest and northern Great Plains
and Rocky Mountains were as many as 8 degrees below normal. Elsewhere, hot,
dry weather in Texas adversely affected row crop planting, as well as crop
development and condition. Limited rainfall throughout the Southeast left
many producers waiting for improved soil moisture levels before planting
their crops, while others put seed in the ground to meet insurance deadlines.
Conversely, above average precipitation in the Corn Belt, Great Plains, Ohio
Valley, and Rocky Mountains limited small grain and row crop planting in many
areas.  With rain-drenched fields throughout much of the Corn Belt, Great Lakes
region, and the Ohio Valley limiting fieldwork activities during April,
producers had planted just 4 percent of the Nation's corn crop by May 1,
fifty-three percentage points behind last year and 27 percentage points
behind the 5-year average. A week of near-normal temperatures and little to
no rainfall allowed for an increased planting pace during the week ending
May 8. In Iowa, producers worked long hours for much of the week, planting
61 percent, or nearly 8.5 million acres, of their intended 2011 crop.
Favorable weather conditions continued throughout much of the latter half of
May, allowing producers ample time to plant their crop and promoting rapid
emergence across much of the major growing regions. Conversely, persistently
wet weather severely limited fieldwork in Ohio for much of the month, leading
to a major planting delay at month's end. By May 29, planting was complete or
nearing completion in many States, and emergence had advanced to 66 percent
complete, 17 percentage points behind last year and 12 percentage points
behind the 5-year average. Overall, 63 percent of the corn crop was reported
in good to excellent condition on May 29, compared with 76 percent from the
same time last year.  As May began, sorghum producers in Texas were planting irrigated fields in
the High Plains, while a lack of rainfall and less than adequate soil
moisture levels in many dryland fields in other areas of the State caused
planting delays. Nationally, 30 percent of this year's crop was planted by
May 8, compared with 33 percent last year and a 5-year average of 29 percent.
Despite scattered showers, the planting pace in Kansas was steady mid-month
with progress slightly ahead of last year and normal. By May 29, forty-six
percent of the sorghum crop was planted, on par with last year but
3 percentage points behind the 5-year average.  Wet weather continued to limit fieldwork for producers in many of the major
oat-producing regions of the country as the month began. By May 1, seeding
was complete in 45 percent of the Nation's oat fields with 35 percent of the
crop emerged, 27 and 10 percentage points behind the 5-year average,
respectively. Improved weather conditions in Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
and Wisconsin allowed for increased seeding mid-month; however, progress
remained well behind both last year and normal. Crop emergence remained
steady following the increased seeding pace. By May 29, producers had sown
89 percent of the Nation's oat crop, 10 percentage points behind the 5-year
average. Emergence was behind normal in all major estimating States except
Iowa and Texas, where progress was complete or nearly complete. With activity
limited to Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, and Texas, 27 percent of the oat crop was
headed by May 29, slightly behind both last year and the 5-year average. In
Texas, heading was nearly complete and producers had harvested 59 percent of
their crop. Overall, 56 percent of the oat crop was reported in good to
excellent condition, compared with 78 percent from the same time last year.  As rain, snow, and below average temperatures further delayed the start of
fieldwork in North Dakota, the largest barley-producing State, producers
Nationwide had seeded just 18 percent of this year's crop by May 1,
thirty-three percentage points behind last year and 25 percentage points
behind the 5-year average. Fields began to dry out and weather conditions
improved mid-month, allowing producers in North Dakota time to begin seeding
fields, while cool temperatures in portions of the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rocky Mountains limited crop development. By May 29, seeding
advanced to 72 percent complete, compared with 96 percent last year and a
5-year average of 95 percent, and thirty-nine percent of the barley crop was
emerged, 38 percentage points behind both last year and the 5-year average.  One-third of the winter wheat crop was at or beyond the heading stage as May
began, ahead of both last year and the 5-year average. Above average
temperatures and unusually dry conditions in areas of the central and
southern Great Plains promoted rapid crop development, but negatively
impacted crop conditions throughout much of the month. While head development
gained speed in the Midwest as warmer temperatures prevailed mid-month,
flooding and soggy fields caused a decline in crop conditions in Arkansas and
Illinois. Cool, damp weather in the Pacific Northwest and northern Great
Plains and Rocky Mountains slowed crop development, pushing overall progress
behind the average pace for the first time this season during the week ending
May 22. By May 29, heading of the winter wheat crop had advanced to
72 percent complete, slightly behind last year and 4 percentage points behind
the 5-year average. As May ended, harvest was underway in a limited number of
States. In Oklahoma, producers had harvested 45 percent of this year's crop,
well ahead of both last year and normal. Overall, 33 percent of the winter
wheat crop was reported in good to excellent condition on May 29, compared
with 34 percent on May 1 and 65 percent from the same time last year.  With cool, wet weather limiting fieldwork, seeding progress was behind both
last year and normal in the six major spring wheat-producing States as May
began. As weather conditions improved mid-month, fieldwork activities
increased and producers were able to seed more of their crop. Double-digit
progress was evident in all States except North Dakota during the week ending
May 15. Nationally, 68 percent of the crop was seeded by May 29, twenty-six
percentage points behind last year and 27 percentage points behind the 5-year
average. Emergence in Montana and North Dakota, accounting for nearly
62 percent of the country's crop, was 40 percentage points or more behind
last year and 44 percentage points or more behind normal due to cool, wet
weather that had limited fieldwork, as well as crop growth.  By May 1, rice producers had seeded 49 percent of the Nation's crop,
28 percentage points behind last year and 17 percentage points behind the
5-year average. While producers in California took advantage of warm, sunny
weather and seeded 55 percent of their crop in the 14 days ending May 15, a
series of strong, early-month storm systems dumped heavy rainfall on much of
Arkansas and Missouri, limiting seeding progress to 18 percent or less during
the same two weeks. Emergence remained steady behind the seeding pace.
Seeding was nearly complete in Texas and the lower Delta by May 22. In
contrast, double-digit progress was evident in California and the upper
Delta. By May 29, producers had seeded 94 percent of the rice crop,
4 percentage points behind last year and slightly behind the 5-year average.
In Missouri, some intended acreage was unable to be seeded due to poor field
conditions and the lateness of the season. Overall, 53 percent of the rice
crop was reported in good to excellent condition on May 29, compared with
74 percent from the same time last year.  Planting was underway in all but four of the 18 major soybean-producing
States by May 8, although progress, at 7 percent complete, was 21 percentage
points behind last year and 10 percentage points behind the 5-year average.
While planting was most advanced in the Delta, one of the most significant
delays was evident in Mississippi where flooding along the Mississippi River
left many fields under water. Favorable weather conditions in Illinois and
Iowa allowed for rapid planting progress mid-month. By May 22, emergence was
evident in 12 percent of soybean fields across the country. By May 29,
fifty-one percent of soybean crop was planted, 20 percentage points behind
both last year and the 5-year average. Emergence had advanced to 27 percent
complete, 16 percentage points behind last year and 12 percentage points
behind the 5-year average. Emergence was most advanced in the lower Delta,
while adverse weather conditions in earlier weeks had limited crop
development in the upper Delta.  With planting most advanced in Texas, 8 percent of this year's peanut crop
was in the ground as May began, 2 percentage points behind last year but
slightly ahead of the 5-year average. With the exception of Florida, where
unusually dry soils limited progress, favorable weather conditions in most
States promoted a rapid fieldwork pace mid-month. In Georgia, producers made
good late-month progress despite dry soil conditions. By May 29,
seventy-seven percent of the peanut crop was planted, slightly behind last
year but 3 percentage points ahead of the 5-year average.  By May 22, sunflower planting was underway in the four major estimating
States and had advanced to 11 percent complete by May 29, well behind both
last year and the 5-year average. Adverse weather conditions earlier in the
season delayed the start of spring fieldwork in many areas.  As the month began, heavy irrigation was run in cotton fields in southern
Texas, while producers in the Northern High Plains waited for increased soil
temperatures before planting their crop. With improved weather conditions
providing ample time for fieldwork, planting gained speed mid-month as
double-digit progress was evident in 12 of the 15 major cotton-producing
States. Squaring was underway in portions of the cotton crop in many fields
in southern Texas by May 15. Hot, windy conditions left many Texas producers
scrambling to provide enough irrigation to recently planted fields during the
latter half of the month. By May 29, producers had planted 73 percent of this
year's cotton crop, 4 percentage points behind last year and 3 percentage
points behind the 5-year average. Toward month's end, producers in areas of
the High Plains were treating their fields for thrips, while high winds and
hot temperatures damaged some recently emerged cotton.  With soggy field conditions and steady spring rainfall limiting fieldwork in
Minnesota and North Dakota, producers in the four major sugarbeet-producing
States had planted 15 percent of the Nation's crop by May 1, eighty
percentage points behind last year and 46 percentage points behind the 5-year
average. With improved weather conditions helping to dry wet fields, planting
gained speed mid-month. By May 29, planting had advanced to 92 percent
complete, 8 percentage points behind last year and 7 percentage points behind
the 5-year average.  Crop Comments  Winter wheat: Production is forecast at 1.45 billion bushels, up 2 percent
from the May 1 forecast but down 2 percent from 2010. Based on June 1
conditions, the United States yield is forecast at 45.3 bushels per acre, up
0.8 bushel from the previous forecast but down 1.5 bushels from last year.
Expected grain area totals 32.0 million acres, unchanged from last month. As
of May 29, thirty-three percent of the winter wheat crop in the 18 major
producing States was rated in good to excellent condition, 32 points below
the same week in 2010, and heading had reached 72 percent, 4 percentage
points behind the 5-year average.  Forecasted head counts from the objective yield survey in the six Hard Red
Winter States (Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas) are
below last year's level in all States except Oklahoma. Improved weather
conditions during the past month in the Upper Great Plains resulted in higher
forecasted yields. Harvest had begun in Oklahoma, Texas, and southern Kansas.  Forecasted head counts from the objective yield survey in the three Soft Red
Winter States (Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio) are all above last year's
levels. Wet conditions in Ohio lowered yield expectations from last month. If
realized, yield in North Carolina will be a new record high and the Michigan
yield will equal the record high.  Forecasted head counts from the objective yield survey in Washington are
above last year. The percent of the crop headed in the Pacific Northwest was
behind the 5-year average in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Yield forecasts
increased from last month in Oregon and Washington despite rust concerns.  Durum wheat: Production of Durum wheat in Arizona and California is forecast
at a collective 23.5 million bushels, up 1 percent from May and up 14 percent
from last year. The cooler than normal growing season in California has set
harvest slightly behind normal. If realized, California's yield of
110.0 bushels per acre will tie last year's record high yield.  Peaches: The 2011 peach crop in California, Georgia, and South Carolina is
forecast at 940,000 tons, down 3 percent from last year.  In California, Clingstone development has been slowed due to spring rains and
cooler than normal April temperatures. This year's statewide full bloom date
was three days later than last year. The Extra Early and Early varieties were
reported to have a heavy set, while the Late and Extra Late varieties were
reported to have an average set. Cool and windy weather conditions have
growers busy protecting their orchards from mildew.  California experienced an adequate number of chilling hours, thus benefiting
the Freestone crop. Weather during the bloom period was favorable, resulting
in a good set. There have been some reports of hail damage on the early
varieties, but overall the crop is looking good. The early variety peach
harvest began during May.  In South Carolina, moderate hail damage, along with little rainfall,
negatively impacted crop expectations. Dry weather has allowed producers to
begin harvesting ahead of schedule.  Harvest began in Georgia around mid-May and reached 20 percent complete by
month's end, which is ahead of the 5-year average of 9 percent. Many of the
smaller, non-irrigated operations reported very small fruit size due to the
drought-like conditions experienced this year.  Bartlett pears: Production of Bartlett pears in California, Oregon, and
Washington is forecast at 414,000 tons, up 6 percent from last year.  In California, the Bartlett growing season thus far has been characterized by
cool, wet weather. Cool spring temperatures delayed the start of harvest by a
few days. Minimal pest pressure was reported.  This spring has been unusually cool and wet in Oregon. Pear trees blossomed
late and estimated harvest dates are two weeks behind normal. Some growers
reported a good fruit set while others were concerned about fruit set in
their areas.  Washington experienced the coldest April temperatures on record followed by
exceptionally cool, wet conditions during May. Some growers reported
pollination problems due to cold, wet weather which occurred during bloom.  Sweet cherries: The combined 2011 sweet cherry production for California,
Oregon, and Washington is forecast at 301,000 tons, up 2 percent from 2010.
Washington's production is forecast at 180,000 tons, up 13 percent from the
previous year. If realized, this will be the second largest crop on record.
The Oregon crop is behind by two to three weeks due to an unusually cool
spring which limited bee activity and pollination. California experienced a
relatively cool and moist growing season for cherries.  Prunes (dried plums): California's 2011 prune production forecast is
122,000 dried tons, down 4 percent from the revised 127,000 tons in 2010.
Cooler and wet weather delayed this year's dried plum bloom. Rain held up
pollination and some growing areas experienced hail and frost.  Apricots: California's 2011 production forecast is 55,000 tons, down
7 percent from the 2010 crop. Heavy precipitation and cool temperatures in
the spring slowed the maturity of the crop. The harvest is several days
behind due to rain during pollination and cool temperatures which slowed the
development of apricots.  Florida citrus: In the citrus growing areas, temperatures were predominately
in the 80s during the month. Weather stations reported lows in the 60s and
highs in the 90s this month. Drought conditions persisted with little
precipitation recorded throughout May in most citrus producing areas.  Harvesting of grapefruit neared completion while Valencia harvesting
continued. Valencia oranges and grapefruit made up the majority of fruit
going to the plants. Heavy irrigation and harvesting dominated the grove
activities this month.  California citrus: The Valencia orange and grapefruit harvests continued
normally in the San Joaquin Valley, as the navel orange, lemon, and mandarin
harvests neared completion. Lemons and grapefruit continued to be picked
along the Southern Coast.  California noncitrus fruits and nuts: Early cherries were picked in Southern
California and the San Joaquin Valley. The harvest of early-variety apricots,
peaches, and nectarines began. The blueberry and strawberry harvests were
ongoing in the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys along with new plantings.
The olive bloom began in the San Joaquin Valley, while the grape bloom ended.
The bloom was not uniform. Thinning and irrigation continued in fruit
orchards and vineyards, as well as weed and pest control.  Normal nut drop occurred in almond orchards with larger nut drop being
observed among Butte varieties. Cooler temperatures continued to delay almond
development. Nut fill has been slow. Monitoring of the peach twig borer,
navel orangeworm, and mites was ongoing. Blight control sprays were ongoing
in walnut orchards as bloom continued and pesticide sprays were applied in
pistachio orchards. High numbers of navel orangeworm were reported in
pistachio orchards in Kern County, causing affected growers to add an
insecticide to planned nutrient sprays.  Grapefruit: The 2010-2011 United States grapefruit crop is forecast at
1.22 million tons, up 1 percent from the May 1 forecast but down 1 percent
from the 2009-2010 crop.  Florida grapefruit production is forecast at 19.9 million boxes
(846,000 tons), up 2 percent from the previous forecast but down 2 percent
from last season. The Florida white grapefruit forecast is 5.90 million boxes
(251,000 tons), up 5 percent from the previous forecast, but down 2 percent
from the 2009-2010 season. The colored grapefruit forecast, at 14.0 million
boxes (595,000 tons), is unchanged from the previous forecast but 2 percent
below last season. As of May 1, approximately 98 percent of the white
grapefruit crop and all of the colored grapefruit crop had been harvested.
California and Texas grapefruit production forecasts were carried forward
from the previous forecast.  Tangerines and mandarins: The United States tangerine and mandarin crop is
forecast at 615,000 tons, unchanged from the May 1 forecast but up 3 percent
from the previous season. Florida's tangerine crop is forecast at
4.60 million boxes (219,000 tons), unchanged from the previous forecast but
up 3 percent from the previous season. Utilization and survey data indicate
that the Florida tangerine harvest is complete. Arizona and California
tangerine and mandarin production forecasts are carried forward from the
previous forecast.  Tangelos: Florida's tangelo forecast is 1.15 million boxes (52,000 tons),
unchanged from the May 1 forecast but up 28 percent from last season's final
utilization.  Hops: Area strung for harvest in 2011 for Washington, Oregon, and Idaho is
forecast at 30,016 acres, 4 percent below the 2010 crop of 31,289 acres. All
three States growing hops decreased their acreage from the previous year.
Early growth was slow due to a cool, moist spring. The growth rate picked up
as the crop progressed and hops were reported to be one third to one half to
the wire. By June 1, the presence of downy mildew was above average in
Washington.  Sugarbeets: Production of sugarbeets for the 2010 crop year is revised to
31.9 million tons, down slightly from the January end-of-season estimate but
7 percent above 2009. Planted area totaled 1.17 million acres while harvested
area totaled 1.16 million acres, both unchanged from the previous estimate.
The United States yield, at 27.6 tons per acre, is also unchanged from the
previous estimate but up 1.7 tons per acre from the record high set in 2009
making the 2010 crop yield a new record. Record high yields for the 2010 crop
were achieved in Colorado, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wyoming.  Sugarcane: Production of sugarcane for sugar and seed in 2010 is revised to
27.4 million tons, down 3 percent from the March estimate and down 10 percent
from 2009. Area harvested for sugar production totaled 877,500 acres for
sugar and seed for the 2010 crop year, down 5,700 acres from March but up
3,600 acres from the previous year. Yield for sugar and seed is estimated at
31.2 tons per acre, down 0.6 ton from the previous estimate and down 3.6 tons
from 2009.  Production of sugarcane for sugar is revised to 25.7 million tons, down
3 percent from the March estimate and 10 percent below 2009. Area harvested
for sugar production totaled 825,300 acres, down 4,400 acres from the
previous estimate but up 8,300 acres from last year. Yield of sugarcane for
sugar is revised to 31.1 tons per acre, down 0.7 ton per acre from March and
3.8 tons per acre below 2009.  Sweet potatoes: Production of sweet potatoes in 2010 totaled 23.8 million
cwt, unchanged from the Crop Production 2010 Summary released in January 2011
but up 22 percent from the previous year. Growers harvested 117,000 acres, up
21 percent from 2009. Yield per acre, at 204 cwt, is unchanged from January
but up 3 cwt from last year and is a record high.  Maple syrup: The 2011 United States maple syrup production totaled
2.79 million gallons, up 43 percent from the revised 2010 total. The number
of taps is estimated at 9.58 million, 3 percent above the 2010 revised total
of 9.26 million. Yield per tap is estimated to be 0.292 gallons, up
38 percent from the previous season's revised yield.  All States showed an increase in production from the previous year. Vermont
led all States in production while production in New York rebounded from last
year's cold affected season. Pennsylvania production was a record high. Ohio
producers reported excellent sap collecting conditions which produced the
highest yield per tap that the State has seen since this statistic was first
measured in 2001. Temperatures were reported to be favorable for optimal sap
flow in all States. On average, the season lasted 32 days compared with
23 days last year. In most States, the season started later than last year.
The earliest sap flow reported was January 10 in New York. The latest sap
flow reported was February 14 in New Hampshire.  Sugar content of the sap for 2011 was down from the previous year. On
average, approximately 43 gallons of sap were required to produce one gallon
of syrup. This compares with 46 gallons in 2010 and 43 gallons in 2009. The
majority of the syrup produced in each State this year was medium to dark in
color with the exception of Connecticut.  The 2010 United States price per gallon was $37.50, down $0.40 from the
revised 2009 price of $37.90. The United States value of production, at
$73.6 million for 2010, was down 19 percent from the revised previous season.
The value of production was down in all States.  Statistical Methodology  Wheat survey procedures: Objective yield and farm operator surveys were
conducted between May 25 and June 6 to gather information on expected yield
as of June 1. The objective yield survey was conducted in 10 States that
accounted for 72 percent of the 2010 winter wheat production. Farm operators
were interviewed to update previously reported acreage data and seek
permission to randomly locate two sample plots in selected winter wheat
fields. The counts made within each sample plot depended upon the crop's
maturity. Counts such as number of stalks, heads in late boot, and number of
emerged heads were made to predict the number of heads that will be
harvested. The counts are used with similar data from previous years to
develop a projected biological yield. The average harvesting loss is
subtracted to obtain a net yield. The plots are revisited each month until
crop maturity when the heads are clipped, threshed, and weighed. After the
farm operator has harvested the sample field, another plot is sampled to
obtain current year harvesting loss.  The farm operator survey was conducted primarily by telephone with some use
of mail, internet and personal interviewers. Approximately 5,600 producers
were interviewed during the survey period and asked questions about the
probable yield on their operation. These growers will continue to be surveyed
throughout the growing season to provide indications of average yields.  Orange survey procedures: The orange objective yield survey for the June 1
forecast was conducted in Florida, which produces about 75 percent of the
United States production. Bearing tree numbers are determined at the start of
the season based on a fruit tree census conducted every other year, combined
with ongoing review based on administrative data or special surveys. From
mid-July to mid-September, the number of fruit per tree is determined. In
September and subsequent months, fruit size measurement and fruit droppage
surveys are conducted, which are combined with the previous components and
are used to develop the current forecast of production. California and Texas
conduct grower and packer surveys on a quarterly basis in October, January,
April, and July. California also conducts objective measurement surveys in
September for navel oranges and in March for Valencia oranges.  Wheat estimating procedures: National and State level objective yield and
grower reported data were reviewed for reasonableness and consistency with
historical estimates. The survey data were also reviewed considering weather
patterns and crop progress compared to previous months and previous years.
Each State Field Office submits their analysis of the current situation to
the Agricultural Statistics Board (ASB). The ASB uses the survey data and the
State analyses to prepare the published June 1 forecasts.  Orange estimating procedures: State level objective yield estimates for
Florida oranges were reviewed for errors, reasonableness, and consistency
with historical estimates. The Florida Field Office submits its analyses of
the current situation to the Agricultural Statistics Board (ASB). The ASB
uses the Florida survey data and their analyses to prepare the published
June 1 forecast. The June 1 orange production forecasts for California and
Texas are carried forward from April.  Revision policy: The June 1 production forecast will not be revised; instead,
a new forecast will be made each month throughout the growing season. End-of-
season wheat estimates are made after harvest. At the end of the wheat
marketing season, a balance sheet is calculated using carryover stocks,
production, exports, millings, feeding, and ending stocks. Revisions are then
made if the balance sheet relationships or other administrative data warrant
changes. End-of-season orange estimates will be published in the Citrus
Fruits Summary released in September. The orange production estimates are
based on all data available at the end of the marketing season, including
information from marketing orders, shipments, and processor records.
Allowances are made for recorded local utilization and home use.  Reliability: To assist users in evaluating the reliability of the June 1
production forecast, the "Root Mean Square Error," a statistical measure
based on past performance, is computed. The deviation between the June 1
production forecast and the final estimate is expressed as a percentage of
the final estimate. The average of the squared percentage deviations for the
latest 20-year period is computed. The square root of the average becomes
statistically the "Root Mean Square Error." Probability statements can be
made concerning expected differences in the current forecast relative to the
final end-of-season estimate, assuming that factors affecting this year's
forecast are not different from those influencing recent years.  The "Root Mean Square Error" for the June 1 winter wheat production forecast
is 5.4 percent. This means that chances are 2 out of 3 that the current
winter wheat production will not be above or below the final estimate by more
than 5.4 percent. Chances are 9 out of 10 (90 percent confidence level) that
the difference will not exceed 9.4 percent. Differences between the June 1
winter wheat production forecast and the final estimate during the past
20 years have averaged 72 million bushels, ranging from 3 million to
242 million bushels. The June 1 forecast has been below the final estimate
11 times and above 9 times. This does not imply that the June 1 winter wheat
forecast this year is likely to understate or overstate final production.  The "Root Mean Square Error" for the June 1 orange production forecast is
1.6 percent. However, if you exclude the four abnormal production seasons
(two freeze seasons and two hurricane seasons), the "Root Mean Square Error"
is 1.7 percent. This means that chances are 2 out of 3 that the current
orange production forecast will not be above or below the final estimates by
more than 1.6 percent, or 1.7 percent, excluding abnormal seasons. Chances
are 9 out of 10 (90 percent confidence level) that the difference will not
exceed 2.7 percent, or 3.0 percent, excluding abnormal seasons.  Changes between the June 1 orange forecast and the final estimates during the
past 20 years have averaged 128,000 tons (150,000 tons, excluding abnormal
seasons), ranging from 5,000 tons to 368,000 tons when including or excluding
abnormal seasons. The June 1 forecast for oranges has been below the final
estimate 7 times and above 13 times (below 4 times and above 12 times,
excluding abnormal seasons). The difference does not imply that the June 1
forecast this year is likely to understate or overstate final production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
