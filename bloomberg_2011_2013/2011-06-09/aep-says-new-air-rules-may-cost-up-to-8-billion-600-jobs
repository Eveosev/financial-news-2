American Electric Power Co. Inc. said
it would have to spend up to $8 billion through the end of the
decade to comply with proposed federal regulations aimed at
curbing carbon-dioxide emissions from coal-fueled electric  power
plants .  The company estimated it would cut about 600 jobs and
shutter five coal-fueled power plants in Virgina, West Virginia
and  Ohio  if proposed federal rules are enacted, American
Electric said in a statement today.  “Unrealistic timelines” in the Environmental Protection
Agency proposals would force the company to prematurely shut
about 25 percent of its current coal-fueled generating capacity,
or 6,000 megawatts, said  Michael Morris , American Electric’s
chairman and chief executive officer.  Business will face “10 percent to more than 35 percent”
electricity price increases, Morris said in the statement.  Coal-fueled generation accounts for about 65 percent of
American Electric’s total generating capacity. The company has
spent more than $7.2 billion since 1990 to reduce emissions from
its coal power plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
