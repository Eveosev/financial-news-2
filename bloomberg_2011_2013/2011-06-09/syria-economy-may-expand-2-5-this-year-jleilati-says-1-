Syria ’s economy may expand as much as
2.5 percent this year, Finance Minister Mohammad Jleilati said.  “From the economic data we have, we cannot say that the
growth will range from 5 percent to 6 percent,” Jleilati said.
“It might range between 2 and 2.5 percent, but this is not
final,” he said.  Jleilati said that the Syrian economy is “strong.” The
country has as much as $18 billion in foreign reserves, the
equivalent of two years of imports, he said.  The government canceled a planned Treasury bond sale this
month as it had no requirement to borrow, he told reporters in
the country’s capital Damascus yesterday. A sale may take place
next month, he said.  “The cost of bonds will be an additional burden on the
Treasury,” because of higher yields, he said. “The government
has no need to borrow at the moment, so we canceled the
issuance.”  The country canceled a sale of 1 billion Syrian pounds ($21
million) of one-year notes on March 16 as investors sought
higher yields amid turmoil in the region that has also since led
to unrest in Syria. Since then, the country has not auctioned
any bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
