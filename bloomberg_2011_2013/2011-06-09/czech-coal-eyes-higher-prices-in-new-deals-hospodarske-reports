Czech Coal AS, a mining company,
plans to raise prices of brown coal in new contracts with
heating companies,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing company
spokeswoman Gabriela Benesova.  Brown coal may cost about 70 koruna ($4) per gigajoule,
compared with current price of 40 koruna to 45 koruna, the
newspaper said.  Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS, a company that manages
several heating companies in the country, said more expensive
