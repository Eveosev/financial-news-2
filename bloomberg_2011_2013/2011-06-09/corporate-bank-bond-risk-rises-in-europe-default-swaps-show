The cost of insuring against default
on government debt sold by  Greece ,  Portugal  and Ireland surged
to records, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on Greece soared 30 basis points to 1,522,
Portugal increased 16 to 722 and Ireland rose 10 to 690 as of
2:30 p.m. in London, according to CMA. The Markit iTraxx SovX
Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments rose 4 basis
points to 203, the highest since Jan. 12.  Swaps on  Spain  increased 6.5 basis points to 261.5,  Italy 
climbed 6 basis points to 165 and Belgium was 4 basis points
higher at 144, according to CMA. An increase signals a
deterioration in investor perceptions of  credit quality .  The cost of insuring corporate debt also rose. The Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 40 companies with mostly
high-yield credit ratings increased 2 basis points to 395, the
highest since March 17, while the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of
125 investment-grade companies rose 1 basis point to a five-
month high of 107.25, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps linked to the
senior debt of 25 European banks and insurers climbed 4.5 basis
points to 163.5 and the subordinated index jumped 10 to 278,
both the highest since March, JPMorgan prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.5 million) of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value
in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
