Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d. fell
to its lowest in more than two years after Moody’s Investors
Service downgraded the Slovenian lender to Baa3 from Baa1,
citing risks of rising bad loans and weakening capital.  The stock tumbled as much as 3.9 percent to 7.5 euros, its
lowest intraday level since March 2009. Nova Kreditna traded
down 1.9 percent at 7.65 euros as of 11:22 a.m. in Ljubljana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
