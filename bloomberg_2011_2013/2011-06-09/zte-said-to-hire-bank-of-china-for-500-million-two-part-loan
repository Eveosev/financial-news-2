ZTE Corp. (763) , a Guangdong-based maker of
video conferencing and mobile communications systems, hired Bank
of China Ltd. to help it borrow $500 million, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  The term loan consists of a $250 million facility, which
matures in three years and a $250 million facility maturing in
five years, said the person, asking not to be identified as
details are private. About 10 banks are expected to join Bank of
China as so-called mandated lead arrangers by the end of this
month, the person said.  ZTE, founded in 1985, is located in more than 140
countries, according to its  website . The companyâ€™s revenue from
its businesses outside of  China  accounted for 54 percent of
total operating revenue last year and, for the first time,
markets in the U.S. and  Europe  contributed the largest portion.
ZTE has 3.95 billion yuan ($609.8 million) of loans maturing
before the end of 2049, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The three-year loan pays a margin of 160 basis points more
than the London interbank offered rate and a so-called all-in
payment of 190 basis points, while the five-year facility pays a
margin of 195 basis points more than Libor and a total rate of
225 basis points, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
