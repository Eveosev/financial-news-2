French business confidence fell for a
second month on concern that economic growth is slowing because
of climbing  interest rates  and higher commodity prices.  The Bank of  France ’s Business Sentiment Indicator for
manufacturers fell to 103 in May from a revised 106 in April,
the central bank said today. Economists expected a reading of
106, according to the median of three forecasts gathered by
Bloomberg News.  France’s expansion will likely slow from the 1 percent pace
set in the first quarter as the  European Central Bank  lifts
interest rates and Brent oil prices that have risen 63 percent
in a year crimp consumer spending, economists said. The ECB’s
governing council, which meets later today, remains on track to
raise rates next month, Bloomberg surveys of economists showed.  “While we expect the second quarter to be good, the
consequences of the rise in commodity prices and the beginning
of normalization in ECB rates will be felt, which will lead to a
gradual slowdown,” said Pierre-Olivier Beffy, chief economist
at Exane BNP Paribas in Paris. Beffy predicts the French economy
will expand 0.6 percent in the second quarter.  All 51 economists forecast the ECB will keep its benchmark
rate at 1.25 percent at the June 9 meeting. The Frankfurt-based
central bank led by  Jean-Claude Trichet  may increase borrowing
costs by 25 basis points in July, a separate survey showed.  The lower confidence reading prompted the Bank of France to
cut its forecast for second-quarter gross domestic product
growth to 0.4 percent from 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
