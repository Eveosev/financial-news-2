Ukraine’s grain harvest will probably
increase about 11 percent this year to 44.15 million metric tons
on bigger plantings of corn and wheat and on better condition of
winter grains, researcher ProAgro said.  The corn harvest may gain by about 23 percent to 15.47
million tons, Nikolay Vernitsky, director of Kiev-based ProAgro,
said today by phone. The wheat crop will rise more than 11
percent to 19 million tons and barley will fall by 14 percent to
7.4 million tons.  Exports in the marketing year starting July 1 will probably
advance to 20.85 million tons from 11.2 million tons in the year
that ends on June 30, Vernitsky said.  Wheat exports will reach 8.47 million tons, barley
shipments will be 3.35 million tons and corn exports 8.65
million tons, according to ProAgro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
