The European Union said its carbon
transaction log won’t process any transfers of permits between 3
p.m. Brussels time on June 10 and 9 a.m. on June 12 because of
tests carried out by the United Nations emissions system.  The bulk of the UN disaster-recovery testing of its
International Transaction Log for pollution rights and emission-
reduction credits will take place on June 11, the European
Commission said on its  website .  The EU Community Independent Transaction Log, or CITL,
records and authorizes transactions between accounts in national
carbon registries under the European emissions-trading system,
the world’s largest. The national registries are connected to
the CITL through the UN log.  To contact the reporter on this story:
