The lira strengthened to the highest
level in almost a week as investors bet  Turkey ’s central bank
will be forced to raise to contain inflation.  The lira climbed 0.5 percent to 1.5739 per dollar at 5:53
p.m. in Istanbul. A close at that level would be the strongest
since June 3. Yields on benchmark two-year bonds fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.90 percent, according to
the TEB local benchmark bond index, dropping for a second day.  Turkish expectations for inflation in 12 months time
reached 6.93 percent compared with 6.88 percent two weeks ago,
the central bank in Ankara said on its website yesterday, citing
a fortnightly central bank survey. Turkish policy makers may
boost the interest rate a quarter-percentage point to 6.5
percent in the third quarter, 7 percent in the fourth quarter
and 8.75 percent by October 2012, according to the median of 16
estimates in Bloomberg surveys. Inflation jumped to an
annualized 7.2 percent in May from 4.3 percent in April.  “The central bank certainly does not want the lira to
depreciate because otherwise inflation will turn very ugly,”
Suha Yaygin, deputy chief of emerging markets at Toronto-
Dominion Bank in  London , wrote in e-mailed comments. “The
market is waiting to see the bank’s position but expectation of
interest rate increase is driving the trade.”  Foreign investors raised their holdings of Turkish bonds by
$954 million to $41.8 billion in the week ending June 3, central
bank data showed today. Turkey will hold parliamentary elections
on June 12.  “Any investor, trader who wants to take Turkish risk
before the Sunday elections is doing so via fixed-income
instruments, especially the benchmark, and equities are marked
by low volume levels and no liquidity,” Isik Okte, a trader at
Finans Invest, said in e-mailed comments.  The  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  of stocks fell 0.6 percent to
63,670.08.  To contact the reporter on this story:
