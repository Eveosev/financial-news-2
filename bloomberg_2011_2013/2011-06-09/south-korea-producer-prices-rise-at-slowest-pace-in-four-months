South  Korea ’s producer prices rose
at the slowest pace in four months, bolstering the case for the
nation’s central bank to keep borrowing costs on hold for a
third straight month today.  Prices increased 6.2 percent in May from a year earlier,
after peaking at a 28-month high of 7.3 percent in March, the
 Bank of Korea  said in a statement in Seoul today. They fell 0.1
percent from April, the first decline since June 2010.  Consumer-price gains, which held above the central bank’s 4
percent target ceiling, also moderated last month. The central
bank will probably hold its benchmark seven-day repurchase rate
at 3 percent today, according to nine of 17 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. The rate decision will be announced at around
9:30 a.m.  Consumer prices rose 4.1 percent in May from a year earlier,
the fifth-straight month it exceeded the central bank’s target
of 2 percent to 4 percent through 2012.  Core inflation  excluding
volatile food and energy items accelerated to a two-year high of
3.5 percent in May.  The central bank has raised interest rate from a record-low
2 percent since early July as it expects consumer prices to rise
3.9 percent this year, while the economy will grow 4.5 percent.  Governor Kim Choong Soo and his board unexpectedly left
borrowing costs unchanged last month after two quarter-point
increases in January and March. Kim said on May 18 that the Bank
of Korea will continue to boost borrowing costs at its own pace
and that the nation needs to be vigilant about inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
