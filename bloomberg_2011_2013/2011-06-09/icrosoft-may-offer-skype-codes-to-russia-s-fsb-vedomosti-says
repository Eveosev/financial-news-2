Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  may disclose the
source code for Skype Technologies SA’s Internet telephone
programs to  Russia ’s Federal Security Service after it completes
its acquisition of the company, Vedomosti said.  Microsoft already provides the main successor agency to the
Soviet KGB with the source codes for its own products, the
Moscow-based newspaper said. The FSB, as the agency is known,
won’t be able to listen to individual Skype calls with only the
source codes, though the data may help it hack the service,
Vedomosti said.                 Microsoft, in a statement, said it has no plans to make
Skype’s encryption codes available to the FSB.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
