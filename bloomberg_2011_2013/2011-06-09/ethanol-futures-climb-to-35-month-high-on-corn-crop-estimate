Ethanol futures climbed to a 35-month
high in  Chicago  after the U.S. Agriculture Department reduced
its estimate of corn inventories.  The biofuel gained after the government said stockpiles
before the start of the 2012 harvest may fall to 695 million
bushels, the lowest level since 1996, and world inventories may
reach the lowest level since 2004. Ethanol in the U.S. is made
from corn.  “The eastern Corn Belt is going to be a problem area,”
said  Terry Reilly , an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
in Chicago. “Industrial users are already paying up for corn.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 7.4 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $2.758 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since July 7, 2008. Ethanol has gained 77 percent
in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  jumped 8 cents,
or 2.9 percent, to $2.83 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
gained 7.5 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.75, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 3.5 cents, or 1.3 percent,
to $2.845 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel increased 3
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.825.  Corn futures for July delivery surged 21.5 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $7.855 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The crop will total a record 13.2 billion bushels, down
from the month-ago projection of 13.505 billion, the Agriculture
Department said.  A record 5.05 billion bushels of corn will go toward
ethanol production, the department forecast, up from 4.6 billion
in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
