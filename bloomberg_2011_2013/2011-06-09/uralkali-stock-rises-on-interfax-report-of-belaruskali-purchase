OAO  Uralkali (URKA) ,  Russia ’s largest potash
producer, rose to a two-month high in Moscow after Interfax
 reported  that owner Suleiman Kerimov may buy control of a state-
owned competitor in Belarus for $15 billion.  Uralkali rose 2 percent to 245.9 rubles as of the 6:45 p.m.
close of trading, the highest price since April 6. The stock has
gained 12 percent this year, valuing Berezniki-based Uralkali at
522 billion rubles ($19 billion).  Kerimov is close to reaching an agreement to buy 50 percent
plus one share of potash producer Belaruskali, the Russian
newswire reported today, citing an unidentified person with
knowledge of the situation. The stake may cost $15 billion,
Interfax said. The report follows a Wall Street Journal article
saying on June 7 that Kerimov and potential investors from  China 
met Belarussian officials to discuss a deal.  “Acquiring a controlling stake in Belaruskali is positive
for Uralkali since it prevents Chinese companies from acquiring
control,” Mikhail Safin, an equity analyst at  Renaissance
Capital , said in an e-mailed report today.  Uralkali’s press office and Anton Averin, a spokesman for
Kerimov’s Nafta Moskva investment vehicle, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
