Frunet S.L. , a Spanish producer of
fruits and vegetables, sued a German health authority and sought
emergency access to files linking the outbreak of E. coli to the
company’s cucumbers.  The Malaga-based company filed the request after the
Hamburg health authority declined to provide full documentation
on the process of testing the cucumbers,  law firm  Lindenpartners
said in an e-mailed statement today. The financial damage to
Frunet and other producers is “immense and existence-
threatening,” according to the statement, which didn’t say
whether Frunet was seeking compensation. No one at the Hamburg
Authority for Health and Consumer Protection picked up the phone
after business hours today.  German officials are struggling to find the source of the
infection, which has claimed 27 lives and has affected almost
3,000 people, mostly in  Germany . Spanish cucumbers and organic
sprouts, which health agencies suspected, have not been proven
to be responsible for the outbreak.  “Lindenpartners criticizes the information policy of the
Hamburg health authority, which has scared the public with
demonstrably wrong and partly contradictive statements and which
has caused massive harm to vegetable producers all over
 Europe ,” the firm said in the statement. “The opaque
distribution of competencies and responsibility at federal and
state levels has contributed to this situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
