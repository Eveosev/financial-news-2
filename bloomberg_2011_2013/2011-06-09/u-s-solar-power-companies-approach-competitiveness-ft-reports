U.S. solar-power companies say
theyâ€™ll be in a position to compete on price with conventional
generation within three years, without subsidy, as costs come
down, the Financial Times reported.  In  California , the cost of solar power is close to that of
gas-fired plants at times of peak demand, the newspaper said.  Rob Gillette, the chief executive officer of Arizona-based
 First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , said the company plans to cut the cost of its
thin-film solar modules by 20 percent by 2014, after which it
will be able to sign contracts with California utilities to sell
power for 10 to 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, the FT reported.  Thomas Dinwoodie, who founded SunPower Corp., told the
newspaper that solar is cheaper than new nuclear power and is
competitive with gas and coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
