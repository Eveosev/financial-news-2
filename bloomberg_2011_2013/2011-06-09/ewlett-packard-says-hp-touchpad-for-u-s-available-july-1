Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , hoping to tap
into the tablet market dominated by Apple Inc.’s  iPad , said it
will begin sales of its TouchPad computer in July.  The tablet will sell for $499.99 to $599.99 depending on
storage capacity,  Palo Alto , California-based Hewlett-Packard
said in a statement today. Sales will begin in the U.S. on July
1, followed by the U.K., Ireland, France,  Germany  and Canada.  The first version of the TouchPad will have Wi-Fi
technology to connect to the Internet through wireless hotspots.
A future version of the device will connect through  AT&T Inc. (T) ’s
wireless network, Hewlett-Packard said.  Personal-computer makers are rushing into the tablet market
as consumers buy the smaller, touchscreen devices and demand for
traditional PCs slacks off. This week, research firm IDC lowered
its estimate for growth in PC shipments this year to 4.2 percent
from a February estimate of 7.1 percent, citing competition from
tablets and smartphones as well as the sluggish economy.  The TouchPad will compete with the iPad, Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc.’s Xoom and the Research In Motion Ltd. PlayBook.  Hewlett-Packard added 10 cents to $35.46 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped
16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
