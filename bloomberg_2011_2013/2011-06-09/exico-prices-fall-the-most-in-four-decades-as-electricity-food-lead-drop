Mexico ’s consumer prices last month
fell the most in 42 years as electricity, food and education
costs declined, cementing expectations that policy makers will
keep  interest rates  at a record low this year.  Prices dropped 0.74 percent, the central bank said today on
its  website , the most since the index was created in February
1969. The decline was more than the 0.66 percent forecast by 17
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Annual inflation slowed to
3.25 percent from 3.36 percent in April.  Policy makers kept their benchmark interest rate unchanged
in May for a record 19th straight month as prices remain within
their target range and the economy expands less than its
potential. Tame inflation and a possible slowdown in some
sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, raise the odds of
a longer rate pause, said Gabriel Lozano, senior economist for
Mexico at  Banco Santander  Mexico.  The central bank “may start raising after March 2012, but
we’re keeping our forecast for the first increase for January
2012,” Lozano said in a phone interview. Policy makers “should
be calm because inflation expectations are well anchored and
core inflation will be below 3 percent.”  Electricity prices, which are regulated by the government
fell 19 percent in May, while tomato prices fell 36 percent.
Education costs fell 0.27 percent.  Rent and utility costs fell for a second month, declining
1.97 percent in May after a 1.68 percent drop in April.  “Going forward we expect to see price pressures in food
and other products,” Lozano said. Banco Santander forecasts
annual inflation of 3.7 percent at year-end.  ‘Within the Forecast’  While policy makers in  Latin America ’s four other major
inflation targeting economies --  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Chile , and
 Peru  -- have been raising rates in 2011, Mexico’s central bank
has been able to keep borrowing costs this year as both growth
and inflation slowed.  Banco de Mexico , led by bank Governor Agustin Carstens, on
May 27 extended its longest-ever rate pause, keeping the
overnight rate at 4.5 percent.  “General inflation is still within the forecast of the
most recent inflation report,” policy makers said in the
 statement  explaining their decision.  Central bank policy makers meet next on July 8.  Inflation, Rate Horizon  Today’s report also showed that the core inflation rate was
0.18 percent in May, higher than the median forecast for a 0.14
percent increase in a Bloomberg survey of 16 economists. The
core inflation rate was 0.08 percent in April.  “Some merchandise and services prices climbed and this may
be the beginning of the trend we expect to see for the remainder
of the year,” Arturo Vieyra, coordinator of economic studies at
Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex in Mexico City, said in a telephone
interview.  Banamex forecasts an annual inflation rate of 3.7 percent
for 2011. “Today’s report doesn’t make us change our call.”  According to the central bank’s monthly  survey  published
June 1, economists cut their 2011 inflation forecast for a third
month, while also keeping their growth forecast unchanged.  Consumer prices will rise 3.67 percent by the end of 2011,
the survey showed, down from a 3.87 percent forecast last month.
The economy will expand 4.37 percent in 2011, according to the
survey.  In the central bank’s last quarterly inflation report
published May 11, policy makers kept their 2011 inflation
forecast unchanged at 2 percent to 4 percent while raising their
growth estimate to 4 percent to 5 percent.  The bank had previously forecast 3.8 percent to 4.8 percent
economic expansion.  Carstens last month said the economy may grow 5 percent in
2011 provided domestic consumption and private investment
recover.  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 11.7840 per dollar at 2:48
p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
