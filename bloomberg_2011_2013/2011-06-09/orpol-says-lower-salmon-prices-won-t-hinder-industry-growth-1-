Morpol ASA (MORPOL) , the world’s largest
salmon processor, said a recovery in production from Chile won’t
drag down prices to a level where industry expansion stalls.  While a resurgence of Chilean output, four years after a
virus decimated fish stocks, will weigh on prices, it will help
stabilize the market and allow growth, Chief Financial Officer
Steven Rafferty said today in an interview in Oslo, where Morpol
is based. “I don’t see salmon prices ever coming back down in
the next five years to very low levels,” he said.  Chile may increase its output of Atlantic salmon to 300,000
metric tons by 2013 from 120,000 tons in 2010, according to a
June 1 report from Chardan Capital Markets. Production of
Atlantic salmon peaked at almost 400,000 tons in 2008.  The prospect of a recovery in  Chile  has helped push down
salmon prices this year, according to UBS AG. The price of
Norwegian exported fresh salmon has dropped 17 percent year-to-
date after a 41 percent gain in 2010. Export prices for fresh or
chilled fish fell 1.6 percent to 36.08 kroner ($6.67) a kilogram
in the week to June 5, after sliding 5.4 percent the prior week.  A price of about 35 kroner would ensure sustainable growth
in the industry, Rafferty said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
