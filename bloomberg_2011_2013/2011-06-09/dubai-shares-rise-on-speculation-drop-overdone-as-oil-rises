Dubai shares rose, pushing the
benchmark index toward its biggest gain in more than a week,
helped by climbing  oil prices  and speculation among investors
that this week’s decline was unjustified.  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the United Arab Emirates’ biggest bank
by assets, climbed to the highest level in more than a month.
 Gulf Navigation Holding (GULFNAV) , a company that specializes in shipping
oil and chemicals, headed for the highest close in more than two
weeks. The benchmark DFM General Index climbed 0.7 percent to
1,562.88 at 12:51 p.m. in the emirate, trimming its decline this
week to 0.2 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  rose 0.2
percent, bringing this week’s loss to 1.5 percent.  “The market is rebounding from the weakness we saw this
week, which wasn’t justified. The market witnessed some weakness
with the global markets,” said Chahir Hosni, equity sales
manager at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai. “The surge in oil
prices might have helped the sentiment.”  Crude for July delivery rose as much as 96 cents to $101.70
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was last up 49 cents at $101.23.  Emirates NBD gained 2.2 percent to 4.20 dirhams, the
highest intraday level since April 27. Gulf Navigation climbed
2.4 percent to 38.5 fils.  Abu Dhabi’s measure advanced 0.2 percent, Oman’s  MSM30
Index (MSM30)  and Qatar’s index gained 0.3 percent. Bahrain’s gauge was
little changed.  Saudi Arabia ’s market is closed for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
