Daily exports of North Sea Oseberg
crude for July will increase 11 percent from this month,

totaling 4.2 million barrels this month.  Statoil ASA (STL) , Norwayâ€™s largest oil company, is the operator
of the field. Oseberg is one of four North Sea oil grades used
to price crude from the  Middle East ,  Africa  and  Russia . The
other blends are Brent, Ekofisk and Forties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
