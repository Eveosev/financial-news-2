Swiss stocks were little changed,
trading near a 2 1/2 month low, as investors awaited a report on
U.S. unemployment claims and  Nestle SA (NESN)  declined, offsetting
chemical companies which rose.  Nestle retreated 0.7 percent after Barclays Plc downgraded
the shares.  Straumann Holding AG (STMN) , a dental implant maker,
slumped 2.1 percent.  Syngenta AG (SYNN) , the world’s biggest producer
of crop-protection chemicals, gained 1.6 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies retreated 0.1 percent to 6,247.96 at 12:47 p.m.
in Zurich. The measure has fallen 7 percent from this year’s
high on Feb. 18 as U.S. manufacturing and payroll reports fueled
concern that the recovery in the world’s largest economy is
faltering. The broader Swiss Performance Index also lost 0.1
percent.  “Investors have been increasingly worried about the
sustainability of global growth,” said Lars Knudsen, who
manages an 80 million-euro ($117 million) equities fund at LGT
Capital Management AG in Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland . “But the
second or third-quarter reporting season could be the positive
catalyst the markets are looking for. Until then, weak macro
numbers can be a drag on the market.”  Unemployment Claims  The U.S. Federal Reserve said yesterday after European
markets closed that the economy expanded at a “steady pace” in
most of the country, while it slowed in 4 of the 12 regions as
consumers contended with higher food and fuel prices and
shortages of parts reduced car production.  A report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  today may show the
number of U.S. applications for unemployment insurance payments
fell to 419,000 last week from 422,000 the previous week,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Nestle, which makes up 24 percent of the SMI, slipped 0.7
percent to 52.95 Swiss francs as Barclays cut the world’s
biggest food company to “equal weight” from “overweight.”  Straumann dropped 2.1 percent to 218.80 francs after BofA
Merrill Lynch Global Research lowered its rating on the shares
to “underperform” from “neutral.”  Syngenta advanced 1.6 percent to 284.60 francs after
Citigroup Inc. named the company as one of its most preferred
stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
