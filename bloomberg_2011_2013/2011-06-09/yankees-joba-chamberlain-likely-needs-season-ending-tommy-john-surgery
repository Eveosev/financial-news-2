Joba Chamberlain of the  New York
Yankees  probably needs season-ending surgery on a torn
ligament in his pitching arm, manager  Joe Girardi  said.  Chamberlain was placed on the disabled list yesterday
with a sore elbow. The right-handed relief pitcher probably
requires ligament replacement surgery, known as Tommy John
surgery, and would be out for 12 months, Girardi said in an
interview today on WFAN Radio.  The five-year veteran had no swelling and no
discoloration in his arm, which is abnormal for a torn
ligament, according to Girardi. The manager said he was
surprised to hear Chamberlain would likely need the
surgery.  “I just don’t understand how he pitched without it,”
Girardi said. “The weird thing is, he’s been pretty
asymptomatic.”  Chamberlain is 2-0 with a 2.83 earned-run average in
27 appearances this season. His absence further depletes a
Yankees bullpen already missing the injured Rafael Soriano,
who has been on the disabled list since May 17 because of
soreness in his right elbow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
