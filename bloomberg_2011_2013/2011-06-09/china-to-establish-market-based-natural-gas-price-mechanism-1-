China will establish a natural-gas
pricing mechanism that reflects availability of resources and
market supply and demand this year, according to the nation’s
top economic planner.  The government will price gas with reference to other
energy costs, the National Development and Reform Commission
said in a statement on its  website  today.  Gas importers typically buy at international rates that are
higher than the fixed domestic prices they can charge customers.
China has vowed to reform its energy pricing to improve
efficiency of fuel usage.  “It’s likely the country will increase natural-gas prices
again this year if inflation is contained,”  Wang Aochao , head
of China research at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone from
Shanghai today.  The world’s second-biggest energy user raised gas prices by
25 percent in June 2010, the first increase in more than two
years, after higher imports boosted costs for domestic
suppliers. PetroChina Co.,  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  and
 Cnooc Ltd. (883) , are the nation’s largest gas distributors.  The government will accelerate power-price reforms and
increase charges for households that are heavy consumers of
electricity, according to today’s statement. It will develop
more market-oriented rules for oil products and improve the
mechanism for pricing alternative energy, the NDRC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
