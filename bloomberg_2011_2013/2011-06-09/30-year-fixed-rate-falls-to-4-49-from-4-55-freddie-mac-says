Mortgage rates  in the U.S. fell for
an eighth week, reducing borrowing costs as unemployment reached
the highest level this year.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan declined to 4.49
percent in the week ended today from 4.55 percent, according to
Freddie Mac. That’s the lowest since Dec. 2. The 15-year rate
slipped to 3.68 percent from 3.74 percent a week ago, the
McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company said.  Demand for homes is restrained by stricter lending
standards and high unemployment. U.S. companies in May added the
fewest jobs in eight months, Labor Department data showed,
sending down the 10-year Treasury yields that guide some
consumer loans, including mortgage rates. Unemployment
unexpectedly ticked up to 9.1 percent from 9 percent in April.  Declining borrowing costs are encouraging homeowners to
reduce their monthly payments. The  Mortgage Bankers
Association ’s measure of refinancing rose 1.3 percent in the
week ending June 3. The Washington-based group’s purchasing
gauge dropped 4.4 percent.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan is below where it
was last year at this time, when it was 4.72 percent, according
to  Freddie Mac . It fell to a record 4.17 percent in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
