A three-judge federal panel said
today that  Maine  must expedite congressional redistricting and
cannot delay the process until after the 2012 elections.  The judges issued an oral opinion, said Tim Woodcock, the
attorney who brought the case challenging Maine’s system as a
violation of the  Supreme Court ’s “one person, one vote”
doctrine.  The 2010 Census revealed an 8,669-person difference between
the 1st District of Democrat Chellie Pingree and the lesser-
populated 2nd District of Democrat Michael Michaud. The state
 Democratic Party  had argued against a speedy redistricting on
the grounds that federal law doesn’t dictate a time frame for
states to redraw congressional districts.  Maine is the only multidistrict state with a law that
mandates redistricting in years ending with the numeral three.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
