Michael Leiter, head of the National
Counterterrorism Center, has resigned, the White House said in a
statement.  Leiter, 41, a Navy veteran, was named to the post by then-
President  George W. Bush  in 2007 and was kept in place by
President Barack Obama to help develop and shape a national
counterterrorism strategy.  Obama, in the statement, called Leiter a trusted adviser
and said he leaves the nation “in a significantly stronger
position to confront the terrorist threats we face.”  Leiter led an operation that collects intelligence from 16
separate government agencies. Congress faulted an intelligence
lapse that occurred on Christmas Day 2009, with the attempted
bombing of a Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines jet by a Nigerian
man who hid explosives in his clothing. The incident led to
modifications in how those agencies share information.  Deputy Director Andy Liepman will serve as acting director
until Obama nominates someone for the job,  James Clapper ,
director of national intelligence, said in a statement.  White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said the decision to
leave was Leiter’s.  “He has been in that position through two administrations
for four years, which is a significant period of time,” Carney
said at a White House briefing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
