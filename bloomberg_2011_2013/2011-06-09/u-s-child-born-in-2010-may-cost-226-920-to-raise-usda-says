A middle-income family may spend
$226,920 to raise a child born in 2010 to the age of 18, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report .  The estimate is up 2.1 percent from 2009, according to the
 study , posted today on the department’s website. Expenses for
child care, education, transportation and  health services 
represented the biggest increases in child-rearing costs, the
USDA said in a  statement  accompanying the report.  The typical two-parent family spent from $11,880 to $13,830
on each child, the study found. Households that make less spend
less, USDA researchers said. A family earning less than $57,600
a year is likely to spend $163,440 in 2010 dollars to rear a
child, while parents earning more than $99,730 may pay $377,040,
according to the study.  “Child-rearing expenses vary considerably by household
income level,” according to the report. Annual expenses
generally increased with a child’s age, a circumstance true in
both two-parent and single-parent families, the study found.  The report also includes an on-line  calculator  that
families can use to calculate costs based on their unique
situations.  Expensive Northeast  Expenses were highest for children raised in the urban
Northeast, followed by cities in the West and Midwest, the USDA
said. The urban South and rural areas were the least expensive.
Housing accounts for the biggest portion of expenses, averaging
31 percent over 17 years, the USDA said. Child care and
education average 17 percent, with food costs at 16 percent. The
estimates don’t include college expenses.  The study, published each year since 1960, helps courts and
government agencies estimate child-support costs, the USDA said.
In the first study, housing also accounted for 31 percent of the
cost to raise a child, then estimated at $25,230 -- the
equivalent of $185,856 in 2010 dollars. Food was the second-
biggest component, at 24 percent, with transportation at 16
percent, compared with 14 percent in 2010.  In 1960, health care was only 4 percent of the cost of
raising a child, half of what it is now. Education and child
care accounted for 2 percent of costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
