Allegra Versace, who owns 50 percent
of Gianni Versace SpA, has joined the Italian fashion company’s
board as a non-executive director, a spokesman confirmed.  The 25-year-old, who is already working part-time in the
Milan-based company’s style department, will attend her first
board meeting later this month, the Versace spokesman said
yesterday by phone. She is the daughter of head designer
Donatella Versace and the niece of the company’s eponymous
founder, who was murdered in 1997.  Donatella and her brother Santo Versace have helped run the
fashion company known for its Medusa-head logo since their
brother’s murder in Miami. Santo Versace, who is chairman, owns
30 percent of Versace, while Donatella Versace owns 20 percent.
The news that Allegra Versace was joining the board was
previously reported in the Italian media.  Versace, founded in 1978, posted earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of 22.3 million euros
($32.4 million) in 2010 on sales that climbed 9 percent to 292.3
million euros. The company in March forecast a return to net
profit this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
