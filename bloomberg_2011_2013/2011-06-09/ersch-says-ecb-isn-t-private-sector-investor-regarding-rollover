European Central Bank Governing
Council member Yves Mersch said the central bank’s status as a
public institution means it is unlikely to roll over its
holdings of Greek  government bonds .  “There are reflections concerning private-sector
involvement and my understanding is that the central bank is not
a private-sector institution,” Mersch told reporters in
Luxembourg today. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said earlier
today it “is certainly not” the central bank’s intention to
participate in a rollover, even if private investors agree to
such a move to avoid the euro region’s first default.  European Union leaders are pushing for investors to share
the burden of financing a second rescue package for  Greece ,
which remains shut out of financial markets a year after its 110
billion-euro ($160 billion) bailout. Convincing investors to
voluntarily roll over their Greek bonds to prevent the country
from having to pay maturing bonds has been gaining support among
euro-region officials.  “We are not part of these discussions,” Mersch said. “We
have made clear what is our decision concerning our policy
framework and concerning the collateral. We rule out anything
that would not be voluntary and which would be considered to be
a default, either a selective default or which would be
considered as a  credit event .”  Mersch, who leads Luxembourg’s central bank, also signalled
he supports a further rate increase in July, echoing Trichet’s
remarks earlier today that policy makers are in a “strong
posture of vigilance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
