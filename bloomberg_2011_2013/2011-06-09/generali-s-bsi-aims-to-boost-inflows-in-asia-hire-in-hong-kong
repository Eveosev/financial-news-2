BSI Group , the Swiss private bank
owned by insurer  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) , plans to boost
assets under management through inflows from Asian customers and
more than double the number of bankers it employs in Hong Kong.  “We want to recover relatively fast,” from the lag with
other banks that have moved to  Asia  more quickly than BSI, Chief
Executive Officer Alfredo Gysi said at a press conference in
Zurich today. The Lugano-based company’s total assets dropped by
1.9 billion Swiss francs ($2.3 billion) to 76.2 billion francs
last year, while net new money in 2010 was 3.8 billion francs.  The firm opened an office in  Singapore  in 2007 where it
employs 210 people, and has a smaller office in  Hong Kong  where
it plans to get a banking license by September. The bank seeks
to keep the headcount in Singapore “stable” and increase the
number of bankers in Hong Kong to about 120 from 50 by the end
of next year, Gysi said.  “We will break even in Singapore by the end of next year”
and Hong Kong will follow a year later, the CEO said. Assets
under management in Singapore were about $9 billion at the end
of 2010.  The bank plans to attract more wealthy Russian clients and
other eastern Europeans with its office in Zurich, where it
employs 120 bankers, up from 25 five years ago. The Geneva unit,
where BSI has about 140 bankers, mainly focuses on clients from
the  Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
