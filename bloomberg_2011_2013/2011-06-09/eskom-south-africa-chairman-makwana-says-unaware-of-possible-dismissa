Eskom Holdings Ltd. Chairman Mpho
Makwana said he is “unaware” of his possible dismissal as
leader of  South Africa ’s power utility.  Makwana plans on serving his term, which is due to end in
March 2013, unless he is informed otherwise, he said by phone
today. Makwana was responding to a report in Business Day
newspaper, which said South Africa’s Cabinet approved the
replacement of the chairmen of Eskom, ports and rail operator
Transnet SOC Ltd. and defence contractor Denel Ltd. Eskom’s
entire board with the exception of Bernie Fanaroff will be
replaced, the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported, without
