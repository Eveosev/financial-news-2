Palm Hills Developments SAE rose for
the first time in four days after the Egyptian real-estate
developer appointed Mohamed Sultan as chief executive officer
and pledged to deliver 1,210 units within six months.  The shares gained 2.3 percent to 2.24 Egyptian pounds at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  climbed
1.3 percent.  Sultan replaced Yassin Mansour, who is facing trail in
absentia in connection with the sale of state-owned land, which
authorities say violated regulations.  Palm Hills shares tumbled 65 percent this year. Former
Housing Minister Ahmed El Maghraby, a shareholder in the
company, was sentenced to five years in jail as part of
corruption trials of officials linked to the government of
ousted President  Hosni Mubarak .  To contact the reporter on this story:
