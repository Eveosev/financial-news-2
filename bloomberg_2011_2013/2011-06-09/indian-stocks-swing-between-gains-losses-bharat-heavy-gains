Most Indian stocks dropped as  oil
prices  climbed and the nation’s food inflation accelerated.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , India’s biggest truckmaker and the owner
of Jaguar Land Rover, fell to a nine-month low. Car sales grew
at the slowest pace since May 2009 as higher borrowing costs and
rising fuel prices damped demand. Oil climbed for a third day in
 New York . The nation’s food inflation accelerated to an eight-
week high, adding pressure on the central bank to raise  interest
rates  next week.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s biggest
lender, fell the most in two weeks.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index lost 11.43, or
0.1 percent, to 18,382.86, according to preliminary closing
prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The measure swung between gains
and losses at least 14 times as about three stocks declined for
every two that climbed. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National
Stock Exchange of  India  Ltd. decreased 0.1 percent to 5,521.05.
The BSE 200 Index retreated 0.1 percent to 2,285.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
