Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Thailand trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 12:30 p.m. break in
Bangkok.  The SET Index fell 11.58 points, or 1.1 percent, to
1,003.00, an eighth day of declines. That would be its longest
losing streak since January 2010.  Rayong Purifier Pcl (RPC)  , a company that distills
condensate residue into fuels, lost 5.4 percent to 3.52 baht,
bound for the largest drop since Oct. 8. The company will shut
its refinery for 18 days from June 20 to July 7 as part of a
scheduled repair and maintenance plan, the company said in a
statement yesterday.  Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl (STA)  , Thailand’s biggest
publicly traded rubber producer, decreased 3.6 percent to 26.5
baht, set for the steepest decline since May 23. Rubber futures
in Tokyo fell for a second day as a strengthening Japanese
currency and the slow pace of the global economic recovery
raised concern that demand may weaken.  Thai Airways International Pcl (THAI)  , the country’s
largest carrier, slid 6.2 percent to 30.5 baht, headed for the
lowest close since July, on expectations higher  oil prices  will
boost fuel costs. Crude oil rose for a third day in  New York 
after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
yesterday failed to reach an agreement on production targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
