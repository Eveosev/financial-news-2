Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC broadcast
network finished its so-called upfront negotiations, becoming
the second of the biggest networks to wrap up commitments from
advertisers for the television season that starts in September.  ABC “achieved significant increases in pricing” for
advertising, the company said today in an e-mailed statement,
without giving specifics. The rate gains averaged 11 percent to
12 percent, said a person with knowledge of the results, who
wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.  Television networks are capturing price increases thanks to
an advertising rebound since last year.  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox, the
ratings leader in the 18-49 age group sought by marketers,
completed its upfronts last week, drawing price gains of 10
percent to 11 percent, a person said then. CBS, which attracts
the biggest overall audiences, was averaging increases of 14
percent to 15 percent, a person said on June 3.  NBC, the last-place network, was averaging 9 percent price
increases and was about two-thirds done, a person with knowledge
of the situation said on June 7.  Disney, based in Burbank,  California , gained 14 cents to
$39.37 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares added 5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
