The premium for Mars Blend crude in
the U.S. Gulf Coast narrowed for the first time in six days as
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  said there isn’t a timeline for restarting a
coker at its Port Arthur refinery in Texas.  The refinery has restarted two crude units and a fluid
catalytic cracker after a lightning strike caused power failures
and upsets June 6,  Bill Day , a company spokesman, said today. A
restart plan is being developed for the 100,000-barrel-a-day
coker, which remains offline, he said.  Cokers convert vacuum bottoms and heavy oil into lighter
products such as naphtha and heating oil through thermal
processing.  Mars Blend’s premium lost 95 cents to $11.80 over WTI as of
12:13 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the largest drop for the high-sulfur grade since April
21.  U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums also weakened as the spread
between the U.S. benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate and Brent
widened.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for July
delivery increased 25 cents to $17.36 a barrel as of 1:26 p.m.
in New York. When Brent falls versus WTI, it weakens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 30 cents to $16 a
barrel over the benchmark. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost
20 cents to $16.60 over WTI.  Poseidon weakened 50 cents to $11 over WTI. Thunder Horse’s
premium weakened 50 cents to $16 a barrel. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $10.25 over WTI. West
Texas Sour’s discount widened 15 cents to $1.75.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $9.35 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at $19
a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
