Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , rose from the lowest in nine weeks, data from a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, increased 1.8
percent to 20.5 million barrels in the seven days to June 8,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Supplies were at 20.2 million last week, the lowest since
March 30.  Supplies of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, jumped 20 percent, the biggest increase since May 4,
to 15.1 million barrels. Light distillates such as naphtha,
reformate and gasoline dropped 8.7 percent to 9.5 million
barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
