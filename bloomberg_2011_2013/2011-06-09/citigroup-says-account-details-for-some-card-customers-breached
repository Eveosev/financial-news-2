Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. lender, said data for about 210,000 credit-card accounts in
 North America  were breached.  A routine monitoring of online account information revealed
the intrusion, Sean Kevelighan, a spokesman for the New York-
based company, said today in an e-mailed statement. The
unauthorized viewing of account information only affected
customers in North America, Kevelighan said.  Among the data accessed were customer names, account
numbers and contact information, according to Citigroup. Social
Security numbers, dates of birth and bank-card security codes
weren’t accessed, the company said.  “We are contacting customers whose information was
impacted,” Kevelighan said. “Citi has implemented enhanced
procedures to prevent a recurrence of this type of event.”  Citigroup had 21.1 million credit-card accounts at the end
of the first quarter. Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit , 54,
reshuffled the business in September, replacing unit head Paul Galant with Judson Linville, a former  American Express Co. (AXP) 
executive. The division said first-quarter profit from
continuing operations more than tripled to $460 million from the
same period a year earlier.  The Financial Times reported the breach earlier today.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
