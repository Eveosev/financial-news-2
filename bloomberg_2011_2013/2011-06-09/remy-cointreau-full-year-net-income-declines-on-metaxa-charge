Remy Cointreau SA (RCO) , the maker of Remy
Martin cognac, reported an 18 percent drop in full-year profit,
missing analyst estimates, on a writedown of the Metaxa brand in
 Greece .  Net income fell to 70.5 million euros ($103 million) from
86.3 million euros a year earlier, the company said today in a
statement. That missed the 78 million-euro average estimate of
12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The company announced full-
year sales in April.  Remy reported a gross impairment of 45 million euros
related to Metaxa, a whisky- and wine-based spirit, as Greek
consumers, affected by tough economic conditions, bought fewer
bottles.  Distillers are looking to sales of high-priced whisky and
cognac in emerging markets to drive growth as European economies
stagnate and consumer confidence wanes. Paris-based Remy said
today it’s looking at “growth opportunities” after it agreed
in May to sell its Piper-Heidsieck Compagnie Champenoise
champagne unit to EPI.  The disposal of the champagne business will help fund
“accelerated growth in major current markets as well as in
markets with strong potential for future growth,” the company
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
