Chile’s  Supreme Court  will ask Cuba
to extradite Alexis Soto Pastrian for his alleged participation
in the assassination of Senator  Jaime Guzman , the judiciary said
in a  statement  on its website today.  The extradition request will be carried out under the
Montevideo Convention on Extradition, to which both countries
adhere, the judiciary said. Chile and Cuba don’t have a
bilateral extradition treaty, it said.  Soto is accused of participating in the plot to kill
Guzman, according to the statement. The senator, founder of the
UDI political party and legal adviser to former military
dictator Augusto Pinochet, was assassinated in Santiago in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
