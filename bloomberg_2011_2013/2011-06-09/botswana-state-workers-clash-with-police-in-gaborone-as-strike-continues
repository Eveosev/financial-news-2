Some striking Botswanan state workers
clashed with police and broke shop windows in the capital,
Gaborone, yesterday, said Goretetse Kekgonegile, spokesman for
the Botswana Federation of Public Sector Unions.  Union leaders will travel around the country to try make
sure the strike, now in its eighth week, doesn’t become violent,
Kekgonegile said by phone from the capital today.  “That is an unfortunate development and those people are
not our members,” he said. “We are committed to peace.”  State workers in the southern African nation, including
teachers and nurses, have been on strike since April 18 over
pay. The unions and the government failed to agree on terms of a
3 percent pay increase last week. The unions had wanted a 12
percent raise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
