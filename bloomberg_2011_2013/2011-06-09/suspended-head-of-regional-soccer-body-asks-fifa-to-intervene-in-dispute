The suspended acting head of the
group overseeing soccer in North and Central America and the
Caribbean asked the sport’s governing body to intervene in a
dispute over the leadership.  Lisle Austin took over the regional body, Concacaf, last
month when Jack Warner of Trinidad was provisionally removed by
Zurich-based FIFA, the world body. Austin himself was suspended
on June 2 by the Concacaf executive committee after he fired
General Secretary Chuck Blazer, although the acting president
disputes the legality of the move. Today, he asked FIFA to get
involved.  “The organization is under attack from within by those who
refuse to respect the statutes of Concacaf and have no regard
for the rights and interests of the members,” Austin said today
in an e-mailed statement. ‘I will not stand idly by while this
happens and hope, through FIFA intervention or other means, to
restore order to Concacaf as soon as possible.’’  Concacaf, which runs soccer in North and Central America
and the Caribbean, didn’t give specific details of the
violations committed by Austin, of Barbados. The organization on
June 4 said it will ask FIFA to extend the ban worldwide until
Austin has a full hearing on July 13.  Austin became Concacaf’s interim president when FIFA took
action against Warner. Blazer made allegations that Warner and
presidential candidate Mohamed Bin Hammam paid bribes to
Caribbean officials. Both Warner and Bin Hammam were suspended
from their FIFA positions, and deny any wrongdoing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
