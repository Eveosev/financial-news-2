AS Silvano Fashion Group, the second-
largest listed Baltic clothing company, proposed a dividend of 5
euro cents for 2010 and a further share buyback plan at its
annual shareholders meeting.  Shares will be bought back for a total of 17.8 million
euros ($26 million), or a maximum price of 4.50 euros per share,
starting July 1, the Tallinn-based company said in a regulatory
statement late yesterday.  Silvano shareholders approved an initial share buyback last
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
