Wheat rose for a second day in
Chicago on speculation the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will
cut its production forecast for winter varieties after drought
hurt crops in the southern Great Plains.  U.S. farmers may harvest 1.391 billion bushels of winter
wheat, the least in five years, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of analysts before a USDA report due at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington . Farmers are collecting grain in  Texas , Oklahoma and
Kansas after planting in September and October. Large areas of
those states had less than half of the normal amount of rain in
the past 60 days, National Weather Service data show.  The USDA will lower its estimate “as the crops grown in
western Kansas southward into Oklahoma and Texas have fared
badly in the drought there,” economist  Dennis Gartman  wrote in
the Gartman Letter today.  Wheat for July delivery gained 11 cents, or 1.5 percent, to
$7.59 a bushel by 11:43 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe
in Paris climbed 2.50 euros, or 1.1 percent, to 236.50 euros
($345.31) a metric ton.  World wheat output will be lower than previously expected,
the International Grains Council said this week. The crop will
total 663 million tons, 4 million tons below its outlook from
two weeks earlier on downgrades for  France ,  Germany  and the
U.K., the IGC said.  Corn for July delivery slipped 0.5 cent, or 0.1 percent, to
$7.635 a bushel in  Chicago . The grain climbed as much as the
exchange limit of 30 cents yesterday and is up 21 percent this
year, the best-performing agricultural commodity in the 19-
contract Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  Soybeans for November delivery fell 5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $13.875 a bushel. The oilseed has dropped 1.1
percent this year, lagging behind corn on speculation growers
may switch to soybeans after wet weather delayed grain sowing.
Soybeans can be planted until late June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
