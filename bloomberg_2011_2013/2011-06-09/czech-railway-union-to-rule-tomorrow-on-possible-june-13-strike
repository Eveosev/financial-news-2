Czech railway unions may strike on
June 13 if the Cabinet doesn’t abandon plans to overhaul public
finances with measures including a value-added tax increase.  The probability of the strike has “neared 99 percent” and
its exact date will be announced tomorrow, Bohumir Dufek, a
union leader, said in  Prague  today after meeting with Finance
Minister Miroslav Kalousek.  The unions also oppose a plan to allow people to redirect
part of their compulsory pension payments into personal accounts
as the Cabinet tries to boost private savings for retirement,
union representatives have said.  “I see the protest of unions as legitimate, but an extreme
measure,” Kalousek told reporters after the meeting. “However,
the government will not back down to demands for system
changes.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
