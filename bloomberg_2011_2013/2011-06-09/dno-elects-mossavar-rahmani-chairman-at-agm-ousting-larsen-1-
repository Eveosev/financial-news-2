DNO International ASA (DNO)  named Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani, the chairman and chief executive officer of
its largest shareholder, RAK Petroleum Pcl, as new chairman at a
general meeting, ousting Berge Gerdt Larsen.  Larsen declined to comment when approached by Bloomberg at
the meeting in Oslo today. RAK in April last year increased its
stake in DNO, the first foreign company to pump oil in  Iraq 
since the 1970s, to 30 percent.  The new board also consists of Gunnar Hirsti, deputy
chairman, as well as Shelley Watson, Marit Instanes and Karen Sund, DNO said in a statement. RAK, a closely held United Arab
Emirates-based oil and gas producer, announced the plan to
replace part of the board half an hour before todayâ€™s meeting,
news agency TDN Finans reported.  The shares rose 1.5 percent to 7.29 kroner at 3:12 p.m.
local time, reversing an earlier decline. The shares were
earlier halted in anticipation of a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
