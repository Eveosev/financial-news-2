The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
increased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 3 basis points to 132.5
basis points as of 9:01 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. That’s on course for its highest close since April 19,
prices from data CMA in New York show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 2 basis points to
112.75 basis points as of 10:10 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The risk benchmark is headed for
its highest since March 17, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 1.5 basis points to 113 basis
points as of 8:12 a.m. in Singapore, according to Credit
Agricole CIB prices. That’s its highest level since March 24,
CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
