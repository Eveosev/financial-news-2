The rand maintained losses against
the dollar after a report showed manufacturing output growth for
April missed analysts estimates.  The currency of  Africa â€™s biggest economy declined for a
second day, weakening 0.6 percent to 6.7579 per dollar by 1:03
p.m. in Johannesburg.  Factory output growth slowed to an annual 0.4 percent in
April from a revised 4.9 percent a month earlier, Statistics
South Africa said on its website today. That missed a median
estimate for 5 percent expansion by 16 economists polled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
