Southern Cross  Healthcare Plc’s 80
landlords are meeting today to discuss whether to take control
of Southern Cross care homes, the  Daily Telegraph  reported,
citing unidentified sources.  One proposal being considered is for landlords Four
Seasons, Bondcare and NHP to take back and operate more than
half of Southern Cross’s 750 properties, the Telegraph said. The
plan would be implemented as quickly as possible and through
talks with Southern Cross, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
