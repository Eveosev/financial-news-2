Kenya ’s three-month borrowing costs
climbed to the highest in more than nine years at a sale where
demand exceeded the amount offered by almost nine-fold.  The yield on 91-day Treasury bills rose to 9.016 percent at
yesterday’s sale, the Nairobi-based Central Bank of Kenya said
in an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest since May 13, 2002,
and compares with a yield of 8.798 percent at the previous
auction. The bank, which had offered 2.5 billion shillings ($29
million) of the debt, received 21.9 billion shillings of bids
and accepted 17.1 billion shillings.  “The money-market yields have risen to levels where
investors are more than willing to actively participate in the
auctions despite a tight money-market environment,” Ronald Olembo a fixed-income dealer at Nairobi-based CfC Stanbic Bank
Ltd., said in a phone interview from the city.  Kenya will boost spending by 15 percent to 1.15 trillion
shillings in the year through June 2012, increasing expenditure
on roads and energy, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said in his
budget speech yesterday. The deficit in East Africa’s biggest
economy will widen to 7.4 percent of gross domestic product.
Domestic borrowing is targeted at 119.5 billion shillings in the
next financial year, down from 125 billion shillings this year,
Kenyatta said.  Kenyan government borrowing costs are increasing as the
East African nation’s inflation rate jumped to a 25-month high
of 13 percent in May. Price growth is expected to advance
further this year as dry weather curbs agricultural production,
central bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said on June 6.  Kenya’s monetary policy committee raised the benchmark
interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 6.25 percent and
the  cash reserve ratio  by the same amount to 4.75 percent,
central bank said on May 31.  The shilling weakened 0.1 percent to 87.73 against the  U.S.
dollar  at 10:03 a.m. in Nairobi today. A close at that level
would be the lowest since March 1994, according to Bloomberg
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
