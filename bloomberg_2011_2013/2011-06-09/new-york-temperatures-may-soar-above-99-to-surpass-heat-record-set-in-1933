Temperatures in  New York  are forecast
to break a 78-year-old record, taxing the electrical grid and
raising health concerns before cooler and drier air sweeps
through the area overnight.  The high today in Central Park is expected to reach 99
degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius), topping a record of 97 set in
1933, said Tim Morrin, a National Weather Service meteorologist
in  Upton, New York.  High temperatures will reach only into the
mid-70s this weekend.  “When you go from today to Saturday, you have a swing of
20 to 25 degrees,” Morrin said by telephone. “A roller
coaster, I would say.”  Warnings and advisories stretch from New York to northern
 Virginia , including Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia,
cautioning residents to limit outdoor activities and guard
against signs of heat stroke, the weather service said.  A second day of high temperatures will drive electricity
demand in New York to the highest level this year, the New York
Independent System Operator, manager of the state’s power grid,
said late yesterday. Supplies are adequate, it said.  Power usage is expected to reach 31,200 megawatts, enough
for 25 million households on an average day, eclipsing peak use
yesterday of 30,603 megawatts, the operator said. More than
36,600 megawatts of supply can be tapped as needed, it said. The
state power use record is 33,939 megawatts, set Aug. 2, 2006.  Record Highs  Record temperatures were set yesterday in  Washington ,
Baltimore and Philadelphia, according to the weather service.
The high in Washington and Baltimore was 99, passing a mark from
1999, and 97 in Philadelphia, topping a 2008 tally.  The  cooling-degree-day value  in New York yesterday was 19,
or 13 above normal. The value, calculated by subtracting a base
of 65 degrees from the daily average temperature, is designed to
show energy demand. The higher the value, the hotter the weather
and the more energy is being used to cool homes and business.  In Baltimore and Philadelphia the value was also 19, or 13
above normal, and in Washington it was 21, or 12 above normal,
according to the weather service.  Morrin said a weather front will move through New York
overnight and bring high temperatures down into the mid-80s by
tomorrow and even cooler in two days.  The normal high temperature in New York is about 77
degrees, according to the weather service. In Philadelphia it’s
79, Washington 82 and Baltimore 81.  Near Normal  Temperatures next week will be nearer to normal in the East
and possibly below normal in the six-state New England region,
according to  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  “Next week is a definite reprieve from recent strong heat
levels in the Midwest and East with cooler, rainier
conditions,” Rogers said in a note to clients today. “The
South should still stay quite hot and humid.”  Rogers’ 6- to 10-day outlook calls for warm air to dominate
the southern U.S. in the same time frame from June 14 to June
18. That warm air is expected to spread into the central U.S.
from the  Great Lakes  to  Texas  from June 19 to June 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
