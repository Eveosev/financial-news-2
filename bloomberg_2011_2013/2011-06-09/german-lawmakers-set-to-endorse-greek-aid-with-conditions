Lawmakers from German Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s coalition are set to pass a nonbinding motion
endorsing a second aid package to  Greece , attaching eight
conditions to reflect voters’ concerns.  The vote in the Bundestag tomorrow will be preceded by
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , who will address the
concerns laid out in the three-page motion.  While calling on the aid to respect Germany’s constitution
and require Greece to abide by budget deficit targets,
bondholders “also carry a responsibility,” the measure says.  To contact the reporters on this story:
