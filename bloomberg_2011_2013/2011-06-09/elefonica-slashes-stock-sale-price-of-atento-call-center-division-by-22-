Telefonica SA (TEF) , Spain’s largest phone
company, cut the price for the initial public offering of its
call-center unit and gave investors another day to place orders.  Telefonica, based in Madrid, reduced the lower end of its
price range for the sale of  Atento Inversiones & Teleservicios
SAU  to 17.25 euros ($25.20) a share, compared with a previous
range of 19.25 euros to 25 euros apiece. It didn’t give a new
maximum price. The company extended the offer period by a day,
it said in a filing. At the new price, the stock sale will raise
about 580 million euros.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta, who had
tried to sell Atento as early as in 2007, is seeking to reduce
debt and focus on  Latin America  to offset declining domestic
market share. Atento shares will begin trading June 14,
Telefonica said.  “The current market environment is making investors more
demanding with the price they’re willing to pay,” Francisco Salvador, a strategist at FGA/MG Valores in Madrid, said by
phone yesterday.  Telefonica shares dropped 0.6 percent to 16.33 euros in
Madrid trading at 9:56 a.m. The stock has slipped 3.7 percent
this year, valuing the phone company at 75 billion euros.  Atento’s revenue rose 26 percent last year to 1.66 billion
euros, with the largest part coming from Brazil, while
Telefonica had sales of 60.7 billion euros. The unit’s operating
profit before depreciation and amortization increased 23 percent
to 190 million euros. Atento had 151,896 employees at the end of
2010, accounting for about half of Telefonica’s workforce.  Listings  Telefonica sold a stake of its mobile unit Telefonica
Moviles SA for 11 euros per share in 2000 in an initial public
offering before buying it out in 2006. The Spanish telephone
operator also offered 5.25 euros a share for the 62 percent it
didn’t own in its internet unit Terra Networks SA in May 2003.
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  led an initial public offering of Terra
stock to institutional investors at 13 euros in 1999 and the
stock soared to 157.65 euros in Feb. 2000.  “Investors still remember other Telefonica listings from
which we lost money such as Telefonica Moviles and Terra
Networks,” said Luis Benguerel, a trader at Interbrokers in
Barcelona.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are managing
the IPO, along with  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA)   To contact the reporters on this story:
