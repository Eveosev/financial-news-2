Gold rose for the first time in three
days on speculation that higher energy costs will boost demand
for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation. Palladium
futures jumped to a three-month high.  Crude oil topped $102 a barrel in  New York  after the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to reach an
agreement on production targets. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  signaled this week that there won’t be a third round of
so-called quantitative easing and U.S. interest rates will
remain low.  “Crude oil is hugging the $100 level and won’t let go,”
said Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago .
“People are choosing to focus on inflationary fears because the
Fed will have to maintain low rates into next year.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $4, or 0.3 percent,
to settle at $1,542.70 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal has gained 25 percent in the past year, reaching
a record $1,577.40 on May 2.  “Crude oil is a barometer for the camp that wants to buy
gold as an inflation hedge,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  The Fed will end its second round of quantitative easing by
buying back $600 billion in Treasuries by the end of the month.
The central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero
percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 80.4 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $37.424 an ounce, the biggest gain since May 25. The
price has doubled in the past 12 months.  Palladium futures for September delivery climbed $12.40, or
1.5 percent, to $818.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Earlier, the price reached $819.75, the highest for a
most-active contract since March 7.  Platinum futures for July delivery gained $13.50, or 0.7
percent, to $1,844.70 an ounce. Earlier, the metal reached
$1,849.30, the highest since May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
