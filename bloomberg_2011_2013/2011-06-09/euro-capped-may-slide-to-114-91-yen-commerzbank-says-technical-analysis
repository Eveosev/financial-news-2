The euro may decline to as low as
114.91 yen after failing to break through a key technical
resistance level against the Japanese currency, according to
Commerzbank AG.  “Euro-yen has been capped by the 55-day moving average at
117.85,”  Axel Rudolph , a senior technical analyst in London,
wrote in an e-mailed report today. “A drop to the March-to-June
uptrend line at 115.91 now seems probable.”  The 17-nation currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 116.95
yen as of 11:15 a.m. in London. It rose to 117.85 yen yesterday,
before closing at 116.51.  Should the  currency pair  fall below 115.91, “the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement of the March-to-April advance at
114.91 will be back in the picture,” Rudolph wrote.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. A resistance level is an area on a chart
where analysts anticipate orders to sell a currency may be
grouped, while a support level is where they anticipate buy
orders to be clustered.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
