Jitendra Panda, head of broking at
Future Capital Holdings Ltd., comments from Mumbai on the
outlook for Indian equities.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. fell 0.3 percent. The gauge slid 3.3 percent in May,
the most since January.  On market outlook:  “This is the time to buy, as the gloom is deepest. We are
advising clients to start building a long-term portfolio now as
the markets remain in a consolidation phase. Investors are
waiting and keeping an eye on  oil prices  and  interest rates .
However, we don’t expect a deep cut from the oil price rise and
rate increases. Nifty will get support at 5,300. A small blip
will give investors a good entry point.”  On sectors:  “We are long-term bullish on automobile, banking and
retail stocks. From a near-term perspective, pharmaceutical,
fast-moving  consumer goods  and other consumer stocks look
positive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
