The  Boston  Bruins beat the  Vancouver 
Canucks 4-0 in Game 4 of the National Hockey League’s Stanley
Cup Final.  The best-of-seven series is tied at two games apiece after
tonight’s matchup at TD Garden in Boston. Vancouver will host
Game 5 on June 10, with the teams returning to Boston three days
later. A decider, if necessary, is scheduled for June 15 in
Vancouver.  The Canucks lost on their previous trips to the series in
1982 and 1994. The Bruins have been beaten five times in the
Stanley Cup Final, most recently in 1990, since they collected
the last of their five NHL titles in 1972.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
