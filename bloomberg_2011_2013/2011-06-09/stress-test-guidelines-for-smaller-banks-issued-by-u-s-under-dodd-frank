The three top U.S. banking regulators
are issuing guidance to banks with assets of $10 billion or more
on what officials expect to see in annual stress tests mandated
by new financial reform laws.  The Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping set of financial reforms
passed last July, requires banks both large and small to run
their loans, securities portfolios, and funding operations
through various economic scenarios, including periods of rising
unemployment and economic decline. Regulators are now setting
the standards for smaller banks. About 120 banks supervised by
the Fed will be affected.  The Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. today
described broad guidelines for what they would like to see in
the tests, according to a notice issued in  Washington .  “An effective stress-testing framework covers a banking
organization’s full set of material activities, exposures, and
risks, whether on or off the balance sheet,” the proposed
guidance said.  Earlier this year, the Fed asked the 19 largest banks to
run their capital plans through a stress test before allowing
them to boost dividends.  To contact the reporters on this story:
