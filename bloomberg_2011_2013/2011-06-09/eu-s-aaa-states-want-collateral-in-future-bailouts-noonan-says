Michael Noonan , Irish finance
minister, comments on negotiations among European Union states
to allow countries providing bailouts to other member states to
seek collateral from recipients. Noonan spoke at an event in
Dublin yesterday.  On collateral proposals:  “A new concept, which is coming through to view now is AAA
countries who have been guaranteeing the funds so far for
 Greece , Portugal and Ireland, are saying that in future if more
money is required, they will take a lien on the national assets
of certain countries, the same as the bank manager would take
the deeds of your farm for a loan. That’s the latest trend from
Europe now and we’ll see how it is played out in  Europe  over the
next couple of weeks, it will be played out in Greece over the
next two weeks.”  “It is still at the negotiation stage, obviously there
will be resistance to it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
