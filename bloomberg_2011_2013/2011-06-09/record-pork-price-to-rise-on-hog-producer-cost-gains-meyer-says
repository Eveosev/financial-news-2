U.S. pork prices that already are the
highest ever probably may rise further as hog producers pass
along the increased costs of  animal feed , said Steve Meyer, the
president of Paragon Economics.  “There’s still a significant amount of upside risk on feed
costs as we go into 2012,” Meyer said today in a speech at the
 World Pork Expo  in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “The industry is going to
have to get those costs passed along at the wholesale level and
the retail level. We are at record prices for pork, and we’re
going to go up as we go through the year and into 2012.”  Retail  pork reached $3.377 a pound in April, the highest
ever, according to government data. On May 16, wholesale pork
climbed to 98.31 cents a pound, the highest since at least
October 1997, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
