Corn jumped to the highest price in
almost three years after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
forecast tighter supplies, as adverse weather hurt crops.  U.S. stockpiles before the start of the 2012 harvest may
fall to 695 million bushels, the lowest since 1996, even as
farmers collect a record crop, the USDA said. World inventories
are projected to drop next year to the lowest since 2004. Prices
have more than doubled in the past year as global output trailed
gains in demand for livestock feed and biofuels.  “Today’s report should be viewed as very bullish,” Bill Gary, the president of Commodity Information Systems in  Oklahoma
City , said in a report to clients. Corn “ending stocks were
forecast at the second tightest level in history,” based on
reserves to cover daily usage, he said.  The rally is boosting costs for meat producers including
 Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and ethanol makers such as Poet LLC. Global
food prices climbed in nine of the past 11 months, touching a
record in February. Food-price inflation, high unemployment and
corruption spurred unrest in northern  Africa  and the  Middle East 
this year, ousting leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt .  Corn futures for July delivery rose 21.5 cents, or 2.8
percent, to close at $7.855 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after touching $7.93, the highest since June 30,
2008.  The U.S. corn harvest may be 2.3 percent smaller than
forecast in May after unusually heavy Midwest rains left muddy
fields too wet for sowing seeds, the government said today.  Fewer Acres  Planted acreage was forecast at 90.7 million acres, down
1.6 percent from last month’s projection. In a survey released
in late March, farmers indicated they planned to sow 92.178
million acres with corn this year. The USDA will update its
estimate of farmers’ intentions in a report on June 30.  The USDA forecast the yield from this year’s crop at 158.7
bushels per acre, unchanged from a month ago and up from 152.8
bushels last year.  The department also projected record U.S. farm prices for
next year, with corn fetching $6 to $7 a bushel on average in
the year that begins Sept. 1, up from last month’s forecast of
$5.50 to $6.50 and the current-year’s average of $5.20 to $5.50.  “This is a very, very tight stocks situation, representing
just 19 days of supply,” Todd Davis, an economist at the
 American Farm Bureau Federation  in  Washington , said today in a
statement. “Farmers can still make up for planting delays
brought on by flooding, but they clearly need cooperative
weather in July and August to make a good corn crop.”  Rising Demand  U.S. farm exports will jump to a record $137 billion in the
year ending Sept. 30 as companies including Bunge Ltd. and
Archer Daniels Midland Co. expand shipping capacity to meet
rising demand, the USDA said last month. The total would be 26
percent higher than last year’s $108.7 billion, and more than
the previous record of $114.9 billion in 2008. The U.S. is the
world’s leading exporter of corn.  Chinese corn consumption in the marketing year that begins
Oct. 1 is forecast to jump 5.2 percent to a record 181 million
metric tons, outpacing projected record production of 178
million.  China , the biggest buyer of soybeans, became a net
importer of corn last year for the first time since 1996.  “Chinese demand for corn is significant,” said Sal Gilbertie, the president of Teucrium Trading LLC, which a year
ago launched an exchange-traded product linked to futures of the
grain. “This is the third year in a row of tightening corn
supplies at a time when weather is very erratic.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
