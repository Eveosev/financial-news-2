Chile ’s peso rose as gains in the
price of copper, the country’s main export, overshadowed a
weakening of the euro.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to at 466.60 per dollar
at 1:29 p.m.  New York  time, from 467.38 yesterday. Earlier in
the da it fell as much as 0.3 percent.  “It’s a mixed scenario, with a fall in the euro and a
recovery in copper prices,” said Cristian Donoso, a trader at
the brokerage unit of lender Banco de Chile.  The price of copper, which accounts for about half of
Chile’s exports, rose as much as 0.2 percent in New York. The
euro erased an earlier advance versus the dollar after Jean- Claude Trichet said the  European Central Bank  hadn’t raised its
2012 inflation forecast from 1.7 percent, fueling speculation
the bank won’t increase rates as quickly as previously expected.  Chile’s central bank said yesterday it will keep buying $50
million a day in the coming month as part of a $12 billion
program to raise reserves and limit the peso’s gain. It paid an
average 467.6 per dollar today, according to data posted on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
