An Angolan airforce helicopter
crashed while carrying out a routine patrol, killing its five
passengers, Radio National de  Angola  reported.  The Russian-made helicopter probably crashed because of bad
weather, the Luanda-based radio station said, citing General
Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda, head of Angolaâ€™s armed forces.  The crash took place near the diamond-rich town of Saurimo,
more than 700 kilometers (435 miles) northeast of the capital,
Luanda, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
