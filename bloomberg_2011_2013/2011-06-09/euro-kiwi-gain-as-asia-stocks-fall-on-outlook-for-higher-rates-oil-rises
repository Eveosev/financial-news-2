U.S. stocks rose for the first time
in seven days and the Dollar Index climbed as the trade deficit
narrowed amid record exports and the cheapest valuations of the
year lured equity investors. The euro fell as traders scaled
back bets on the pace of interest-rate increases.  The  S&P 500  advanced 0.7 percent to 1,289.00 at 4 p.m. in
New York after six straight days of losses, its longest slump
since February 2009. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1
percent. The Dollar Index rose 0.3 percent after falling as much
as 0.3 percent. The euro depreciated against 13 of its 16 major
counterparts. Crude oil rose 1.2 percent after OPEC failed to
reach an agreement on production targets, while corn rallied to
a three-year high after the U.S. reduced its harvest forecast.  U.S. equities rebounded after the S&P 500 slumped 6.2
percent from an almost three-year high at the end of April
through yesterday following disappointing data on jobs,
manufacturing and consumer confidence. The slump left the index
trading at 12.1 times forecast earnings for the next year, the
cheapest since last summer, according to Bloomberg data.  “We’re due for a rally after miserable stock
performance,” said  John Carey , a Boston-based  money manager  at
Pioneer Investments, which oversees about $250 billion. “People
have been focusing on the negatives and have not been
emphasizing the earnings momentum. Some stocks present good
values again. It’s a good environment for investors to be
positioning themselves.”  S&P 500 Rebound  The S&P 500’s rebound followed a 4.9 percent slide over the
previous six days. Earnings are forecast to grow 20 percent this
year for S&P 500 companies on 9.8 percent revenue growth,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Producers of raw materials and energy led gains among nine
of the 10 main groups in the S&P 500 today, rising at least 1.2
percent.  Monsanto Co. (MON)  climbed 2.8 percent and  CF Industries
Holdings Inc. (CF)  rallied 4.2 percent to pace gains among
agricultural stocks after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said the nation’s corn harvest may be 2.3 percent smaller than
forecast in May because of excessive Midwest rains.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  climbed 1.5 percent after agreeing
to pay a $10 million fine and stop holding private meetings of
stock analysts and traders known as “huddles” to settle an
investigation by  Massachusetts ’s chief securities regulator.  The U.S. trade gap shrank 6.7 percent to $43.7 billion, the
lowest since December, Commerce Department figures showed. The
gap was projected to widen to $48.8 billion from an initially
reported $48.2 billion in March, according to the median
forecast of 75 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Exports
increased 1.3 percent to $175.6 billion, boosted by sales of
 fuel oil , petroleum products and computers.  Economy Watch  A separate report showed that  consumer confidence  rose last
week for the third consecutive time as lower gasoline prices
lifted Americans’ outlook on their finances. The Bloomberg
Consumer Comfort Index climbed to minus 45.9 in the period to
June 5, the best showing since the end of April, from the prior
week’s minus 47.1. Across income groups, sentiment improved the
most among those making less than $50,000 a year.   Stocks climbed even after U.S. initial jobless claims
unexpectedly rose last week, increasing by 1,000 to 427,000 in
the week ended June 4, according to figures from the Labor
Department. Economists forecast a drop to 419,000, according to
a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose four basis
points to 4.22 percent. An auction of 30-year securities drew a
yield of 4.238 percent, compared with the average forecast of
4.216 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine of the  Federal
Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount offered,
was 2.63, compared with an average of 2.65 at the past 10 sales.  European Stocks  The Stoxx 600 also gained for the first time in seven days,
led by basic-resource and chemical companies. Home Retail Group
Plc plunged 14 percent after cutting its forecast for revenue at
the Argos chain.  The euro weakened 0.5 percent to $1.4517 even as European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said “strong
vigilance” is needed to contain inflation. The ECB left its
main refinancing rate at 1.25 percent, matching expectations
from all 52 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The euro erased an earlier advance versus the dollar and
German  government bonds  fell after Trichet said the ECB hadn’t
raised its 2012 inflation forecast from 1.7 percent, fueling
speculation the bank won’t raise rates as quickly as previously
expected. The 10-year German bund yield slipped two basis points
to 3.03 percent.  Oil Climbs  Crude oil climbed 1.2 percent to $101.93 a barrel in  New
York  after OPEC’s meeting in Vienna failed to reach an accord on
output targets for the first time in at least 20 years. Saudi
Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the meeting “was one of the
worst meetings we’ve ever had.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 21.5 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $7.855 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price reached $7.93, the highest for a most-active
contract since June 2008. Cotton, cocoa and coffee also rallied.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Greek 10-year
bonds instead of benchmark German bunds increased 54 basis
points, while the similar-maturity Portuguese-German spread
widened to 726 basis points, the most since at least 1997, when
Bloomberg began collecting the data.  European Stocks  European governments and the  International Monetary Fund 
would lend as much as an extra 45 billion euros ($66 billion) to
 Greece  under the latest plan to avoid the euro area’s first
sovereign default, two people with direct knowledge of the talks
said. European estimates put Greece’s 2012-14 financing gap at
as much as 170 billion euros, the people said. It would be
filled by the loans, plus around 57 billion euros in unspent aid
from last year’s bailout, roughly 30 billion euros in asset-sale
proceeds and about 30 billion euros in rollovers by creditors.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped 0.2 percent. The
Shanghai Composite sank 1.7 percent amid speculation the central
bank will keep tightening monetary policy.  South Korea ’s Kospi
Index retreated 0.6 percent before tomorrow’s central bank rate
decision.  The  New Zealand dollar  strengthened against all 16 major
peers, climbing 2 percent versus the yen, after the central bank
said commodity prices remain “very strong” and that borrowing
costs will need to increase in the next two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
