B. Gopkumar, executive vice president
of Kotak Securities Ltd., comments on the outlook for Indian
equities. He spoke in Mumbai.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. rose 0.2 percent to 5,536.1 at 9:55 a.m. The gauge
declined 3.3 percent in May, the most since January.  On the outlook for Nifty:  “Nifty is likely to find support at 5,400, from where it
is likely to bounce. We expect the Nifty to consolidate in the
current range for the next three-to-four months.”  On decline in volumes:  “Everybody is waiting and watching. The biggest challenge
is arresting the drop in volumes. Retail participation, which is
muted, has to return for the market to make a meaningful move.
We’re going through a high interest rate cycle. The rate cycles
have a good correlation with volumes.”  On stock valuations:  “Valuations are much nicer now. We expect  government
spending  on infrastructure to climb and inflation to moderate in
the medium term. We are bullish on consumption stories and
automobile stocks.”  On fuel price increase:  “What investors are watching out for is the diesel and
kerosene price increases. If that happens, inflation will rise
and will affect consumption, transportation and infrastructure
sectors.”  Higher fuel prices contributed to Indian inflation that
prompted the central bank to raise  interest rates  nine times in
15 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
