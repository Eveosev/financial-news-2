The U.S. corn harvest may be 2.3
percent smaller than forecast in May as farmers reduced
acreage because of excessive Midwest rains, the government
said.  The crop will total a record 13.2 billion bushels,
down from the month-ago projection of 13.505 billion, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. The
USDA cut its estimate of inventories before the 2012
harvest by 23 percent to 695 million bushels, from 900
million projected in May. The consensus estimate of
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was for a surplus of
781 million.  “It’s going to be a tight supply situation,”  Dan Cekander , the director of grain research for Newedge USA
LLC in Chicago, said before the report. “Now the market
will be watching to see if higher prices slow demand, or
for any signs of new weather problems” that may threaten
yields, he said.  Inventories before the start of this year’s harvest
were estimated at 730 million bushels, unchanged the May
forecast. Analysts were expecting 706 million bushels.  Corn futures in  Chicago  have more than doubled in the
past year after adverse weather reduced U.S. yields last
year and demand for the grain to produce food,  animal feed 
and ethanol increased. Yesterday, the most-active July
contract rose 27.5 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $7.64 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Biggest Crop  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at a record
$66.7 billion in 2010. The U.S. is the world’s biggest
producer and exporter.  Planted acreage was forecast at 90.7 million acres,
down 1.6 percent from last month’s projection. In a  survey 
released in late March, farmers indicated they planned to
sow 92.178 million acres with corn this year.  The USDA forecast the yield from this year’s crop at
158.7 bushels per acre, unchanged from a month ago and up
from 152.8 bushels last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
