The  New York Rangers  will buy out the
final year of team captain Chris Drury’s five-year, $32 million
contract, the New York Post reported.  Drury was limited by injuries to 24 games last National
Hockey League season. His buyout will become official during the
NHL’s transaction window beginning June 15, the Post said,
without citing a source for its information.  The newspaper also reported that the Rangers won’t buy out
the contracts of either Wojtek Wolski or Sean Avery.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
