Ormat Industries (ORMT)  Ltd. climbed the
most on record after  Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) , the U.S. unit of
the developer of geothermal power plants, received a $130
million contract.  Ormat Industries shares surged 14 percent, the biggest
increase since at least November 1995, when Bloomberg began
tracking the stock, to 22.40 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in
Tel Aviv.  Ormat’s U.S. unit won engineering, procurement and
construction contracts from Mighty River Power Ltd. of New
Zealand is “the largest product order in the company’s
history,” the company said yesterday in a PRNewswire statement.  Separately, the company said it isn’t engaged in any talks
with FIMI, responding to reports the fund may invest in Yavne,
Israel-based Ormat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
