Morgan Stanley (MS) , one of three banks
that led LinkedIn Corp.’s initial public offering, holds 2.04
million shares of the professional-networking website.  The stake equals 22.7 percent of the stock sold in the IPO,
the investment bank said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Mountain View, California-
based LinkedIn’s owners sold less than 10 percent of the company
in the offering.  The majority of shares disclosed in today’s filing were
acquired on the open market after the transaction, according to
a person with direct knowledge of the matter. They are being
held on behalf of clients in the New York-based Morgan Stanley’s
funds, the person said, declining to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  LinkedIn’s stock, priced at $45 in last month’s offering,
surged to $94.25 amid scarce supply on the first day of trading.
It has since slid 24 percent in  New York  Stock Exchange
composite trading to close at $72.01 today. Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. and New York-based JPMorgan
Chase & Co. also led the offering.  Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, and Shannon Stubo, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn, said they couldn’t comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
