U.S. stocks advanced, snapping a six-
day decline, as the trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed amid
record exports and  consumer confidence  improved.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth rose 1 percent.  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  and  CF Industries
Holdings Inc. (CF)  paced gains among fertilizer producers, climbing
at least 4.1 percent, after the government reduced its corn-crop
estimate.  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  advanced 2.9 percent
as Deutsche Bank AG recommended buying the shares.  Brown-Forman
Corp. (BF/A)  added 2 percent after the maker of Jack Daniel’s whiskey
reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.7 percent to
1,289.02 at 4 p.m. in  New York . The benchmark gauge yesterday
fell to 12.1 times its companies’ forecast operating earnings,
the cheapest valuation since August, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 75.42
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,124.63 today.  “The stock market got oversold,” said James Dunigan,
chief investment officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth
Management, which oversees $110 billion. “We’ve got some
positive news against the string of poor economic data of the
last few weeks. Earnings are still pretty strong. There’s value
out there if you want to build a long-term position.”  The S&P 500 yesterday completed its longest slump since
February 2009 on concern the economy is slowing. A report last
week showed that payrolls grew at the slowest pace in eight
months. The benchmark equity index doubled from its March 2009
low to 1,363.61 on April 29, its highest level since June 5,
2008, as earnings topped estimates for nine straight quarters.  Trade Deficit Narrows  Stocks rose today as a report showed that the  U.S. trade
deficit  unexpectedly narrowed in April, reflecting a plunge in
auto and oil imports combined with record exports. The gap
shrank 6.7 percent to $43.7 billion, the lowest since December,
Commerce Department figures showed. Exports increased 1.3
percent to $175.6 billion, boosted by sales of  fuel oil ,
petroleum products and computers.  A separate report showed that consumer confidence rose last
week for the third consecutive time as lower gasoline prices
lifted Americans’ outlook on their finances. The Bloomberg
Consumer Comfort Index climbed to minus 45.9 in the period to
June 5, the best showing since the end of April, from the prior
week’s minus 47.1. Across income groups, sentiment improved the
most among those making less than $50,000 a year.  Benchmark indexes advanced even as initial jobless claims
unexpectedly rose by 1,000 to 427,000 last week, the Labor
Department said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected
a drop to 419,000, according to the median forecast.  200-Day Average  Today’s rally in stocks also happened after the S&P 500
yesterday got close to its average price of the last 200 days, a
level monitored by analysts and traders who study charts to make
forecasts. The index yesterday closed at 1,279.56, about 2
percent above its 200-day moving average.  “That’s a very significant level,” said  Ryan Detrick ,
senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research
in Cincinnati. “That’s where we expect some buyers to step in
to defend the longer-term trend.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
