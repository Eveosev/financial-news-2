AT&T Inc. (T) , the second-largest U.S.
mobile carrier, will offer free wireless-Internet access in New
York parks in cooperation with the most populous U.S. city.  The Wi-Fi service will be available in 20 parks across the
city’s five boroughs, including Manhattan’s Central Park and
Battery Park, and Brooklyn’s Prospect Park. Chief Executive
Officer Randall Stephenson and Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  announced
the service in Manhattan today.  The initiative runs for five years and will be free for all
users, Dallas-based AT&T said. The Wi-Fi networks will
complement and compete with the wireless coverage provided by
AT&T and rivals such as Verizon Wireless, the biggest U.S.
mobile carrier, and  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the No. 3.  AT&T fell 1 cent to $30.33 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have added 3.2 percent
this year.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
