Liliane Bettencourt gave up 45
percent of her  L’Oreal SA (OR)  dividends under a settlement with her
daughter in December ending their disputes over gifts to the
cosmetic heiress’s friend,  Le Figaro  reported today from an
interview with her lawyer Pascal Wilhelm.  Bettencourt’s daughter, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers,
receives 20 percent of the dividends directly and the other 25
percent are reinvested in L’Oreal, earning Bettencourt 300
million euros ($438 million), according to the interview with
Wilhelm.  Wilhelm said he is in regular contact with Meyers and her
lawyer regarding the mother’s spending and has an agreement from
them on an investment in a company belonging to another Wilhelm
client, the newspaper said.  As pat of the settlement, Wilhelm has done an inventory of
Bettencourt’s estate, restored her ownership of the Seychelles
island of Arros, and is sorting out the fate of various artworks
Bettencourt had given her friend Francois-Marie Banier, the
newspaper said. Banier received 350 million euros under the
deal, the newspaper said, citing Wilhelm.  Wilhelm said Meyers’s new application, filed June 7, for a
court-appointed guardian for her mother violates the settlement
terms and took him by surprise after he spent time that same day
with Bettencourt, her daughter and son-in-law, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
