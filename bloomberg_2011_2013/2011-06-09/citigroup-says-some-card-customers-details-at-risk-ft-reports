Citigroup Inc. (C)  said yesterday that
hackers may have gained access to data on hundreds of thousands
of card customers, the Financial Times reported.  The bank said in response to questions by the newspaper
that the security breach, affecting about 1 percent of its card
customers, was discovered early last month as a result of
routine monitoring.  The breach occurred at Citi Account Online, which holds
information such as customers’ names, account numbers and e-mail
addresses, the FT said.  Citigroup said it had informed law-enforcement officials
and tightened fraud-detection procedures; it declined to provide
further details, the newspaper said.  The bank said the breach involved only credit-card
accounts; the FT reported, however, that several people had told
it their debit cards were compromised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
