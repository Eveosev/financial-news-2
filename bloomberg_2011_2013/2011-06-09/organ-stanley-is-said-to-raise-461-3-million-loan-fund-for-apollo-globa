Morgan Stanley (MS)  raised a $461.3
million loan fund to be managed by Apollo Global Management LLC,
according to a person with knowledge of the deal.  The collateralized loan obligation, ALM IV, includes a
$274.5 million piece rated AAA by Standard & Poor’s that pays
124 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private.  The new fund brings CLOs backed by widely syndicated loans
issued this year to more than $4 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Banks sold more than $3.4 billion of the
debt in the U.S. last year, more than double the $1.22 billion
in 2009, according to Bloomberg and Morgan Stanley data.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  The Apollo fund also includes a $58.5 million slice rated
AA that pays a rate of 190 basis points more than the benchmark;
a $29.8 million portion graded A; a $20.3 million piece rated
BBB; and a $23.6 million segment rated BB, the person said. It
also has $11.3 million of unrated debt and $43.4 million of
subordinated notes.  Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, declined
to comment.  Charles Zehren , a spokesman for Apollo, didn’t
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
