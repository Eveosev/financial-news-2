Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped in June to terminals near  New Orleans  were unchanged
relative to Chicago futures after the government projected
tightening grain supplies.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 63 cents to 65 cents a bushel above July futures, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  show. The average cash price rose
to a record $8.495 a bushel. The soybean basis was 75 cents to
80 cents a bushel above July futures.  “The cash corn market is strong, and the cash basis will
likely stay firm” after the U.S. government predicted reserves
before the 2012 harvest would be the smallest since 1996, said
 Glenn Hollander , a partner at Chicago-based Hollander &
Feuerhaken, a cash grain broker. “We have not seen any evidence
of price rationing yet, and the people who have the corn are
going to wait for higher prices.”  Corn futures for July delivery jumped 21.5 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $7.855 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price has more than doubled in the past year and touched $7.93
today, the highest since June 30, 2008.  Soybean futures for July delivery fell 7.75 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $13.9375 a bushel, the first drop in three sessions.
The contract has climbed 51 percent in the past year.  The USDA today lowered its projection for the domestic corn
crop by 2.3 percent to 13.2 billion bushels and cut its forecast
for inventories that will be left from this year’s crop before
the 2012 harvest by 23 percent to 695 million bushels.  “The market will be focused on the weather the next 90
days,” Hollander said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
