Hurricane Adrian grew into a major
storm today in the Pacific off the southwestern coast of  Mexico ,
with maximum winds now 130 miles (185 kilometers) per hour,
according to the  U.S. National Hurricane Center .  Adrian, a Category 4 cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson
hurricane scale, was 320 miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico, and
moving west-northwest at 9 mph, the Miami-based agency said at
4:35 p.m. West Coast time.  “This general motion is expected to continue during the
next two days keeping the hurricane away from the coast of
Mexico,” the center said in a bulletin. No watches or warnings
are in effect for land.  Adrian is the first hurricane of the Eastern Pacific season
and is forecast to dissipate early next week, according to the
center’s tracking projections. A storm becomes a hurricane when
winds reach 74 mph and becomes a major, or Category 3, storm at
111 mph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
