Mehmet Dalman, an independent
director at London-listed metals producer Eurasian Natural
Resources Corp., is resigning his seat on the board over
concerns about corporate governance at the company, the
Financial Times reported, citing two people close to the
situation.  This would leave the company with one independent director,
Paul Judge, after the two other independents, Richard Sykes and
Kenneth Olisa were voted off the board on June 8, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
