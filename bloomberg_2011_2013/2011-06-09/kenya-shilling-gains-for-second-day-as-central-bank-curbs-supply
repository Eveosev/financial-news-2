Kenya ’s shilling strengthened the for
a second day against the dollar after the central bank sold
 repurchase agreements  to curb supply of the currency of East
Africa’s biggest economy.  The shilling appreciated 0.1 percent to 87.6 per dollar at
4:04 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi from yesterday’s close of
87.64.  The central bank accepted 500 million shillings ($6
million) of bids for repurchase agreements at a weighted average
rate of 5.75 percent, it said in a statement on its page on
Bloomberg today.  “The mop up by the central bank has provided reprieve to
the local unit, limiting supply,” Wilson Mutai, a dealer at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said by phone.  In a repurchase agreement, an investor agrees to sell a
security to another trader, while at the same time arranging to
buy it back at a future date and at a pre-determined price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
