Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  forecast net income will
drop 16 percent in the year ending March 31 after natural
disasters in Japan crippled its factories.  Net income will probably decline to 200 billion yen ($2.5
billion) in the financial year, the Tokyo-based company said in
a statement today. That compares with the 242 billion yen
average of 12 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s record earthquake and tsunami on March 11, which
disrupted Hitachi’s six plants as well as operations at its
suppliers and customers, will impact full year operating profit
target by 110 billion yen, President Hiroaki Nakanishi said in
Tokyo today. Radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant may also affect earnings at
Hitachi,  Japan ’s second-largest builder of nuclear reactors.  “Outlook for the nuclear reactor business isn’t bright,”
said Yuichi Ishida, a Tokyo-based analyst at Mizuho Investors
Securities Co. which has an “outperform” rating on the stock.  Sales will probably rise 2 percent to 9.5 trillion yen in
the 12 months started April 1, the company said. Operating
income, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and administrative
expenses, may slide 10 percent to 400 billion yen. That compares
with the 9.1 trillion yen and the 415 billion yen average of
analysts’ estimates respectively.  Power System Decline  Profit at Hitachi’s power-systems unit will probably tumble
55 percent to 10 billion yen this fiscal year and income at
electronic-devices unit may decline 58 percent to 23 billion
yen, the company said.  Earnings at the telecommunication systems division,
Hitachi’s biggest profit generator, will probably rise 12
percent to 110 billion yen, it said.  The automotive systems unit’s profit may gain 8 percent to
20 billion yen, Hitachi said.  Separately, Hitachi set a sales target of 10 trillion yen
for the year ending March 2013, down from 10.5 trillion yen
projected a year earlier. Net income will probably exceed 200
billion yen for the year, Hitachi said, reiterating its previous
goal.  Hitachi gained 1.3 percent to close at 469 yen on the  Tokyo 
Stock Exchange before the announcement, extending its gain this
year to 8.3 percent.  In April, President Hiroaki Nakanishi said profit at
Hitachi, one of the three main manufacturers of nuclear reactors
at Fukushima Dai-Ichi, will likely deteriorate after Japan’s
record earthquake damaged company plants and choked supply of
power and parts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
