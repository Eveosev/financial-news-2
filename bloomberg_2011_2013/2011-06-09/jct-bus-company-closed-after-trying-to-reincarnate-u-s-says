A bus company based in  Georgia  was
ordered to close after the U.S. Transportation Department found
it was defying a previous shut-down attempt by operating under a
different name.  JCT Motor Coach Inc. was declared an imminent hazard, the
 Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The company was trying to operate as JT’s
Travel & Charter, the agency said.  “This case is an example of FMCSA’s zero-tolerance
approach to bus companies that try to mislead the public and
violate the law by reincarnating under different names,” Anne Ferro, the top U.S. bus regulator, said in the statement.  U.S. regulators last month said they were cracking down on
operators that reopen under different names after being closed
for safety violations. The Transportation Department has asked
Congress to increase the penalty for unlawfully operating to
$25,000 a day from $2,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
