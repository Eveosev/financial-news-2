the pipeline as of 2010 fell to 240 million metric tons,
according to  an annual carbon finance report  on the bankâ€™s
website.  A year earlier,  the bank expected 281 million tons.  The value of signed emission-reduction purchase agreements,
known as ERPAs, declined 7.6 percent to $1.7 billion, according
