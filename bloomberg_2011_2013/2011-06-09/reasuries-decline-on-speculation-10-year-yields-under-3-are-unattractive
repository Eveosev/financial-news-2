Treasuries dropped, pushing 10-year
note yields up from this year’s low, as a rally in stocks after
the trade deficit narrowed discouraged demand at the $13 billion
auction of 30-year bonds.  The securities drew a yield of 4.238 percent, compared with
the average forecast of 4.216 percent in a Bloomberg News survey
of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  “The 30-year bond seems to be the big laggard this week,
and equities are rising, which combined are weighing on the
Treasury market,” said  Kevin Flanagan , chief fixed-income
strategist at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Purchase, New York.  Yields on 10-year notes increased six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3 percent at 5:16 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
security maturing in May 2021 dropped 16/32, or $5 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 3/32.  The 10-year note yields fell earlier to 2.92 percent, the
lowest level since Dec. 3. A drop in the current 30-year bond
pushed yields to 4.22 percent. Two-year note yields gained four
basis points to 0.42 percent.  At today’s auction, indirect bidders, a class of investors
that includes foreign central banks, bought 38.4 percent of the
securities, compared with an average of 40.4 percent for the
past 10 auctions.  Direct Bidders  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 9.3 percent,
compared with the 10-auction average of 10.1 percent.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount offered, was 2.63, compared with an
average of 2.65 at the past 10 sales.  “We had a good week of auctions until here, which
suggests demand for Treasuries on the very long end is weak
relative to the rest of the curve,” said Michael Pond, co-head
of interest-rate strategy in  New York  at Barclays Plc, which as
a primary dealer is obligated to participate in U.S. government
debt offerings. “There is concern about holding paper that far
out.”  At the $32 billion auction of three-year notes on June 7,
indirect bidders bought 35.6 percent of the offering, the
highest share since January. The government’s $21 billion sale
of 10-year notes yesterday produced a yield of 2.967 percent,
the lowest at such an auction since November.  Rally in Stocks  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose for the first time in
seven days, climbing 0.7 percent. Crude oil for July delivery
gained 1 percent to $101.76 a barrel.  The  U.S. trade deficit  shrank 6.7 percent in April to $43.7
billion, the lowest since December, the Commerce Department
reported in  Washington . Exports rose to a record, while
purchases of goods from  Japan  tumbled in the aftermath of the
March earthquake and tsunami.  Treasury yields fell earlier as Philadelphia Fed President
 Charles Plosser  said in  London  that the  U.S. economy  is going
through a “soft patch.” If growth picks up in the next few
months, it may speed up any exit of the Fed’s emergency
stimulus. However, if the economy “continues to show weakness,
that may push it off,” Plosser said.  U.S. initial jobless claims unexpectedly increased to
427,000 in the week ended June 4, from a revised 426,000 in the
previous week, the Labor Department reported. The median
forecast of 49 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
drop to 419,000 from a previously reported 422,000.  Bernanke’s View  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in Atlanta on June 7 that
record monetary stimulus is still needed to boost a
“frustratingly slow” economic recovery.  Under the central bank’s $600 billion second round of
quantitative easing, the Fed purchased $6.9 billion of debt
maturing from February 2017 to May 2018 today. The program, also
known as QE2, expires this month.  Futures contracts showed the likelihood of an increase in
the fed funds target by the March 2012 meeting has fallen to 23
percent, from 26 percent odds a week ago. The target rate for
overnight lending between banks has stayed at zero to 0.25
percent since December 2008.  “The Fed wants low yields, and they are going to get what
they want,” said Russ Certo, a managing director and co-head of
rates trading at Gleacher & Co. in New York. “There probably
won’t be a third round of quantitative easing, but the Fed is
still likely to keep monetary policy accommodative for longer.”  Pimco Holdings  Pacific Investment Management Co., the world’s biggest
manager of bond funds, revised how it describes the holdings of
its Total Return Fund to show that the flagship bond fund held
 U.S. government debt  in May.  The $243 billion Total Return Fund managed by Pimco’s
founder and co-chief investment officer,  Bill Gross , increased
its holdings of U.S. government debt to 5 percent last month
from 4 percent in April, according to data on the  Newport Beach ,
 California , company’s website.  In the prior month’s posting, the category that was
classified as government and government-related debt had shown
negative holdings of 4 percent. The website showed an added
category this month of swaps and liquid rates, with holdings of
minus 9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
