Croatia wants to spur investment in
buildings and infrastructure in the  tourism industry  by amending
its building code, Minister for Environment Protection Branko Bacic said.  “By amending the legislature and simplifying procedures,
we will be able to increase investment in tourism,” Bacic told
the Cabinet in Zagreb today.  The Adriatic Sea nation is struggling to pull itself out of
two-year recession and needs foreign investors to revive the
economy. Foreign direct investment in 2010 fell to one-third of
the inflows in 2009.  Croatia expects to conclude the talks with the European
Union this month and become the 28th member on July 1, 2013. To
achieve this, the country needs to complete reforms of the
judiciary and align its standards with those of the bloc.  The government today also proposed to legalize buildings
that were built without permits, if they comply with
regulations. The number of such buildings is estimated at
150,000, Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor told the cabinet.  Only buildings constructed by Oct. 30, 2009 will be
considered, she said. Aerial photos made on that day will be
used to confirm a building’s existence, Kosor said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
