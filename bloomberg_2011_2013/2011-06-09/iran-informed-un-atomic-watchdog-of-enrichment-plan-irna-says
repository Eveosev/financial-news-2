Iran had already informed the
 International Atomic Energy Agency  about plans to install an
initial series of centrifuges at its Fordo nuclear facility in
coming months, the official  Islamic Republic News Agency  said,
citing the country’s Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi.  The existence of the Fordo plant, built into the side of a
mountain south of Tehran, was disclosed in September 2009 in a
revelation that heightened concerns among the U.S. and its
allies over  Iran’s nuclear program . They say Iran’s activities
may be a cover for the development of atomic weapons, an
allegation the Persian Gulf country rejects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
