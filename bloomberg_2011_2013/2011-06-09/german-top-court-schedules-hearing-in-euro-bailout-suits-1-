Germany ’s top constitutional court
scheduled a hearing on suits against the nation’s participation
in the euro-area rescue fund and the aid package for Greece.  The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe will hear
oral arguments in three cases over the issue on July 5, the
court said in an e-mailed statement today. The cases were
brought by a group of academics and lawmaker Peter Gauweiler.  “In this lead case, the court for the first time decides
in the main proceedings on constitutional questions relating to
the Greece aid and the Euro-rescue package,” the court said.
“There are many additional cases pending over the issues which
will be ruled on subsequently.”  The German high court has drawn criticism for not acting on
the suits swiftly on the suits, which were filed in the first
half of 2010. The judges declined to issue emergency orders
blocking the aid package for  Greece  in May 2010 and the euro-
area rescue fund in June 2010 and didn’t schedule a hearing on
the main legal questions in the cases until today.  The court’s agenda for the hearing includes as many
admissibility issues as substantive law questions, indicating
that the court is considering whether the case can be dismissed
for procedural reasons. The court normally takes a few months
after a hearing before it issues a ruling.  The cases are BVerfG, 2 BvR 987/10, 2 BvR 1099/10 and 2 BvR
1485/10.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
