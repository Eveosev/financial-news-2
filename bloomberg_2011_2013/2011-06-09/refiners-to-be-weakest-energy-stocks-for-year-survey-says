(Corrects type of executives in first paragraph,
administration of survey in second paragraph.)  Oil refiners will deliver the lowest
returns among energy stocks in the next 12 months, according to
a survey of 175 senior energy executives and institutional
investors.  Over a third of those surveyed said refining stocks will
fare the worst, while about 23 percent said it would be coal.
The survey was given to participants in the  RBC Capital Markets ’
Global Energy & Power Conference in  New York  on June 6 and 7.
Attendees included investors and employees of  ConocoPhillips (COP) ,
 Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  and other energy companies.  “Investors are concerned about demand destruction,” said
 Kurt Hallead , managing director and co-head of global energy
research at RBC Capital Markets, said in a telephone interview.
Rising crude prices and flat demand produce a difficult
environment for refiners, and investors are clearly interested
in sectors that can reap higher profits as oil trades at more
than $100 a barrel, he said.  The best performers relative to the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index will be oil services companies and drillers, 41 percent of
respondents predicted. Exploration and production companies were
the choice of 15 percent.  Those surveyed diverged on the question of how $4 gasoline
prices affect the economy. About 46 percent said they have “no
impact” on gross domestic product, and 53 percent said they
have a “recessionary” impact.  To contact the reporter on this story:
