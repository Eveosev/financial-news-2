Colombia ’s military is mounting an
operation to rescue oil workers kidnapped by guerrillas, three
months after almost two dozen men were abducted while searching
for crude.  Rebels captured four employees of Emerald Energy Plc, a
unit of Beijing-based Sinochem Group, in the southern province
of Caqueta, a defense ministry official who can’t be identified
because of government policy, said today in an e-mail.  Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  has pledged to
ensure security for companies seeking to tap the Andean nation’s
energy reserves. Government auctions of oil blocks have lured
companies including billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s Grupo Carso SAB
and  Eike Batista ’s OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA to
Colombia, South America’s third-largest crude producer.  In March, the government said 22 of 23 oil workers
kidnapped by rebels in eastern Colombia were released within a
day following an army dragnet of the jungle area. Guerrillas
also have sabotaged pipelines this year used by state-run
Ecopetrol SA, Colombia’s largest oil company.  Carlos Bolanos, a marketing vice president in Bogota for
London-based Emerald Energy, didn’t respond to an e-mailed
request for comment sent after office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
