German government bonds rose on
speculation the  European Central Bank  won’t increase interest
rates as quickly as previously forecast.  Two-year note yields fell to the lowest this week and
Euribor futures gained as the central bank said inflation is
unlikely to rise above 2.3 percent in 2012, trimming a previous
forecast for 2.4 percent, prompting traders to pare bets on
increased borrowing costs. President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
signaled the bank intends to raise interest rates in July by
calling for “strong vigilance” on inflation.  “The 2012 forecast is little changed from March, casting
doubt on how much tightening is needed to contain inflation over
the medium-term,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “As a
result bunds have rebounded.”  Two-year note yields fell five basis points to 1.62 percent
as of 4:43 p.m. in  London  after rising as much as five basis
points to 1.71 percent when Trichet began speaking. The 10-year
bund yield was three basis points lower at 3.03 percent. The
3.25 percent security due July 2021 gained 0.225, or 2.25 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount ($1,450), to 101.885.  While the ECB today raised its growth and inflation
forecasts for this year, it predicted both will slow in 2012.
The ECB increased its 2011 inflation prediction to 2.6 percent
from the 2.3 percent predicted in March and left the forecast
for next year at 1.7 percent. The 17-nation euro-area economy
will probably grow 1.9 percent in 2011, up from the previous 1.7
percent projection. Growth may slow to 1.7 percent in 2012, the
ECB said, reducing its estimate from 1.8 percent.  ‘Peripheral’ Meaning  Euribor futures rose, pushing the implied yield on the June
2012 contract down seven basis points to 2.07 percent.  The euro slid 0.4 percent to $1.4527 and 0.1 percent to
116.38 yen.  ECB policy makers are concerned about oil-driven inflation
feeding into wage demands. The danger is that higher borrowing
costs may exacerbate the sovereign-debt crisis that’s pushing
 Greece  toward a default.  “The market is quite quick to factor in what a rate
increase means for the peripherals and this is causing bunds to
rise also on a flight to quality,” said  Michael Leister , a
fixed-income analyst at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf,  Germany . “The
ECB staff forecasts on 2012 inflation remain unchanged and this
is the trigger and the main reason that bund yields are
falling.”  Greek bonds fell for a third day, pushing the two-year note
yield above 25 percent for the first time since June 1.
Portuguese and Irish bonds also dropped.  Credit-Default Swaps  The cost of insuring against default on government debt
sold by Greece, Portugal and Ireland surged to records,
according to traders of credit-default swaps. Contracts on
Greece soared 30 basis points to 1,522, Portugal increased 16 to
722 and Ireland rose 10 to 690 as of 2:30 p.m. in London,
according to CMA. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of
swaps on 15 governments rose 4 basis points to 203, the highest
since Jan. 12.  European governments and the  International Monetary Fund 
would lend as much as an extra 45 billion euros to Greece under
the latest three-year plan to avoid the euro area’s first
sovereign default, two people with direct knowledge of the talks
said. Greek gross domestic product contracted 5.5 percent in the
first quarter, data showed.  “There seems to be a lot of gloomier news about the Greek
rescue package,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed income strategist
at Credit Agricole SA in London. “It’s sentiment rather than
anything else, and we’ve also had disappointing GDP numbers.”  Greek Yields Surge  Greece’s two-year note yield climbed 181 basis points to
25.74 percent. Ten-year yields gained 51 basis points to 16.66
percent, the most since May 26.  Portugal ’s 10-year bond yields climbed 17 basis points to
10.29 percent. They reached a euro-era record of 10.34 percent.
The yield difference, or spread, between Portuguese and German
10-year securities widened to 730 basis points, the most since
at least 1997, when Bloomberg began collecting the data. Two-
year Portuguese note yields were 34 basis points higher at 11.40
percent.  Ireland’s two-year note yields climbed 22 basis points to
11.42 percent, while 10-year yields rose 21 basis points to
11.08 percent, the most since May 31.  Bunds rose on May 5 after the European Central Bank kept
its key interest rate at 1.25 percent and Trichet signaled the
bank would wait until after June to raise interest rates, wrong-
footing some investors who had expected a quicker move.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 0.2
percent this year, while  U.S. Treasuries  returned 3.4 percent
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds have
lost 12 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
