Terex Corp. (TEX)  Chief Executive Officer
Ronald Defeo waited in vain for a meeting with his counterpart
at  Demag Cranes AG (D9C) , Chief Aloysius Rauen, to talk about the U.S.
company’s takeover offer,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an
interview with Defeo.  Rauen didn’t call to arrange a meeting even though he had
promised to do so last week, the Terex manager said, according
to the German newspaper. Demag shareholders have signaled that
Terex’s offer is “attractive,” Defeo told Handelsblatt.  Demag is willing to talk if Terex considers making a more
attractive offer, Demag spokesman Nikolai Juchem said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
