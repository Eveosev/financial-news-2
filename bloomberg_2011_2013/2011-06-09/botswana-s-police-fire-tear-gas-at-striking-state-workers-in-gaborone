Botswana’s police fired tear gas to
disperse striking state workers who had gathered to protest in
Gaborone, said Justin Hunyepa, executive secretary of the
Botswana Secondary Teachers Union.  About 3,500 striking workers held a rally in the capital,
Hunyepa said in an interview today.  State workers, including teachers and nurses in the
southern African nation, have been on strike since April 18 over
pay. The unions and the government failed to agree on terms of a
3 percent pay increase last week. The unions had wanted a 12
percent raise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
