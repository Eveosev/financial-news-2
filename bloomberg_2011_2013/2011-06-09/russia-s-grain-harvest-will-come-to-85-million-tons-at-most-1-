Russia lowered the top end of its
grain-harvest forecast to 85 million metric tons, Agriculture
Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  said.  “If the weather is favorable, we will reap about 85
million tons of grains,” she said today at a government
meeting. The harvest will be sufficient to cover national
consumption and leave an exportable surplus, according to the
minister.  The ministry previously forecast a crop of between 85
million and 90 million tons.  Spring sowing of grains reached 30 million hectares (74
million acres), a 2 million-hectare increase from last year,
Skrynnik said. Sowing of all spring crops has covered 95 percent
of the planned 50 million hectares, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
