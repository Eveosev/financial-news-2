Milling wheat for November delivery
jumped after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said the winter
crop would be smaller than last year after dry weather curbed
production of the grain.  Farmers will harvest 1.45 billion bushels of winter wheat
this year, up from 1.424 billion forecast in May and less than
1.485 billion produced last year, the USDA said today in a
report. Fifteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected
output of 1.391 billion, on average. Dry weather in  France , the
world’s second-biggest shipper, also may curb output.  “The progress of the U.S. wheat crop continues to lag well
behind the historical averages, and the latest estimate for the
French wheat crop suggests a substantial drop in the harvest and
an even greater drop in exports,” said Justine White, an
analyst at VM Group in  London .  Milling wheat futures for November delivery gained 8.50
euros, or 3.6 percent, to 242.50 euros ($353.88) a metric ton by
1:46 p.m. London time on NYSE Liffe in Paris. The price has
surged 89 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
