International Monetary Fund  acting
head  John Lipsky  said his organization is standing by a 4.4
percent forecast for global growth this year even as developed
economies hit a “soft patch.”  Supply-chain disruptions from Japan’s earthquake are
clearing “quite rapidly” and a moderation in energy prices may
continue, Lipsky told reporters in Beijing today.  Rising unemployment and falling home prices in the U.S., a
debt crisis in European nations including Greece, Japan’s March
11 disaster and signs of a slowdown in China have fueled concern
that the world expansion will falter. Asian stocks fell today,
dragging the regional benchmark index to its lowest level in two
weeks, after the  Federal Reserve  said the  U.S. economy  is
cooling in some regions.  The factors that could lead the IMF to revise its forecast
seem “temporary and likely to dissipate,” Lipsky said.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.6 percent as of 12:10
p.m. in  Tokyo .  China’s economy, the world’s second biggest, can expand
about 9.5 percent in 2011 and 2012, with inflation likely
cooling to about 4 percent by the end of this year, Lipsky said.
In April, consumer prices rose an annual 5.3 percent.  While developed nations’ monetary policies should remain
“accommodative,” the official said he didn’t see the need to
make them more so. Meanwhile, those countries need a “clear
path” for adjusting their fiscal policies after the stimulus
measures rolled out to counter the financial crisis, Lipsky said.  The IMF’s most recent global growth forecast was published
in April.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
