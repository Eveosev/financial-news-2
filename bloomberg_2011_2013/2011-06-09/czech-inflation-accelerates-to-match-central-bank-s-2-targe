Czech inflation accelerated to meet
the central bank’s 2 percent target as policy makers debate when
to start raising  interest rates .  The inflation rate rose to 2 percent from 1.6 percent in
April, the Prague-based Statistics Office said on its website
today. The median forecast of 16 economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for 1.8 percent. Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent
on the month in May.  The Ceska Narodni Banka has kept the benchmark two-week
repurchase rate at a record-low 0.75 percent since May 2010 as
central banks in  Europe  lifted interest rates to curb inflation.
The timing of a likely Czech rate increase moved forward to the
fourth quarter from the first quarter in 2012, reflecting
expectations of more monetary tightening in the euro area,
according to a central bank forecast published on May 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
