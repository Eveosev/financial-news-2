The leaders of  Germany ’s 16 states
put back a decision on online gambling to October, said Kurt Beck, the prime minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.  The state prime ministers put off a July date for an
overhaul of the current betting contract to allow them time to
establish a new joint lottery, Beck told reporters today
following a regular meeting of the 16 states.  “We want all 16 on board and there are a number of
technical issues to iron out but we’re making good progress
toward finalizing a new contract in October,” Beck said.  The European Union’s top court ruled last year that
Germany’s betting monopoly, which only allows state-owned
companies to offer most sports betting, violates European laws
because it’s not coherent. The online-betting ban was upheld on
June 1 by Germany’s top administrative court, which said the
rules were in line with constitutional and European Union law.  The states are awaiting a review of their proposals from
the EU. Beck declined to comment on the June 1 ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
