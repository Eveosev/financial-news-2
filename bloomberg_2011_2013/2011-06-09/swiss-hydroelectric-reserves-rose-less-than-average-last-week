Swiss hydroelectric reserves rose
less than average last week, slowing the build-up of water used
to generate power in the country.  Reservoir levels climbed 3.9 percentage points to 25.6
percent full in the week through June 6, the Bern, Switzerland-
based Swiss Federal Energy Office said today in an e-mailed
statement. They typically advance 5.9 points in the week,
according to data kept since 1997. The increase was the fifth
this year.  Water levels in  Switzerland  are 11.1 percentage points
below the long-term average, the data show. Switzerland relies
on hydropower for more than half its annual electricity
consumption of about 55 terawatt-hours. Water supplies typically
fall from October to April during the winter season and are
replenished from May to September by rain and melting snow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
