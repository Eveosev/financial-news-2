De Beers , the world’s largest diamond
producer, said demand will surpass production for at least the
next five years because no new mines are coming on stream.  “For the foreseeable future, five years, it seems to
be the demand for diamonds is going to exceed the supply,”
Chairman  Nicky Oppenheimer  said today in a speech at the Council
on Foreign Relations in  Washington . “That is simply because
there are no new mines.”  Demand has recovered since De Beers, which is based in
Johannesburg, slashed output in 2009 during the financial
crisis. Prices rose 7.7 percent in May as retail sales in
emerging markets improved, the Rapaport Group said today, citing
its composite RapNet Diamond Index of certified, polished
stones.  “We only have the existing mines,” Oppenheimer said.
“Their production is level at best.”  “With China and India coming into the market, I think
demand is going to exceed supply for the immediate future,” he
said.  De Beers, producer of about 40 percent of the world’s rough
diamonds, posted 2010  net income  of $546 million, compared with
a year-earlier loss $743 million. The Oppenheimer family owns 40
percent of De Beers, London-based  Anglo American Plc. (AAL)  has 45
percent and Botswana holds 15 percent.  “We’re seeing diamonds coming back into favor,”
Oppenheimer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
