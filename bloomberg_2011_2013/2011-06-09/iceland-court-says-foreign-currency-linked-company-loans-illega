Iceland’s  Supreme Court  ruled that
corporate loans in Icelandic kronur linked to the value of
foreign currencies are illegal.  The court in Reykjavik issued its  ruling  after reviewing a
single loan of 150 million kronur ($1.3 million) by Landsbankinn
hf to Motormax ehf, a company currently going through insolvency
proceedings. The north Atlantic island’s top court ruled in June
2010 that consumer loans in kronur, linked to the value of
foreign currency, were illegal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
