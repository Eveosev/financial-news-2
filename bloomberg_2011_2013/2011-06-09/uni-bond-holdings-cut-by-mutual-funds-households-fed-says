U.S.  mutual funds , money-market
accounts and individuals cut their holdings of municipal bonds
as borrowing by state and local governments dropped during the
first three months of the year, the  Federal Reserve  said.  The number of municipal bonds outstanding slid by
$20.5 billion to $2.9 trillion during the first quarter, the Fed
said in a release today. That marked the steepest drop since
1995, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Holdings by
households, the biggest owners of the debt, slipped by
$5.6 billion to $1.08 trillion, while those owned by money-
market and mutual funds dropped by $23.8 billion.  Municipal-bond sales have slowed this year since the end of
the Build America Bond program, which provided federal subsidies
to borrowers.  That helped hold returns steady during the first quarter
even as investors pulled money from the market amid speculation
that the fiscal struggles of local governments could lead more
borrowers to default.  To contact the reporters on this story:
