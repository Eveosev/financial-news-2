European coal derivatives rose for
the third time this week in  London  trading.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year added 25 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $130.50
a metric ton by 12:25 p.m. in London. A close of $131 on June 7
was the highest in more than a month. The contract has risen 21
percent in the past year.  Profit from running coal-fired power plants for the next
month, the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 6.37 euros
($9.29) a megawatt-hour, compared with 2.64 euros from burning
natural gas, Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses
electricity prices in  Germany ,  Europe ’s biggest energy consumer,
and takes emission costs into account.  December carbon-dioxide permits under the European Union
cap-and-trade system were 0.1 percent higher at 16.53 euros a
ton. Gas for delivery in the six months through September 2012
to the U.K., Europe’s biggest consumer of the fuel, was little
changed at 66.15 pence ($1.09) a therm in London.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
