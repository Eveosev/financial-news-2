German power for next-year delivery
remained stable near its highest level this week.  Baseload power for 2012 rose 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
59.45 euros ($86.96) a megawatt-hour at 10:16 a.m. Berlin time,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The highest
price this week was 59.75 euros, reached yesterday. Baseload is
power delivered around the clock.  The benchmark traded at its highest in two years on May 31,
climbing to 60.90 euros after  Europe ’s biggest economy hastened
its exit from nuclear energy.  Germany  is the largest nation to
abandon atomic power after the disaster at Japan’s Fukushima
plant stoked concerns about nuclear safety.  Germany has 17 reactors, which last year generated 23
percent of its electricity.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  ordered the
halt of the country’s seven oldest reactors in March after the
Japanese crisis.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
Group Inc., ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition Financial
Services and Tullet Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
