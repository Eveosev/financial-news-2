Corn futures for July delivery rose
20.5 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $7.845 a bushel at 9:37 a.m. on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $7.93,
the highest for a most-active contract since June 2008.  Wheat and rice prices also climbed. Soybeans were little
changed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
