The following is the text of
the U.S. trade balance report for April released by the
Commerce Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, through the  Department of Commerce , announced
today that total April exports of $175.6 billion and
imports of $219.2 billion resulted in a goods and services
deficit of $43.7 billion, down from $46.8 billion in
March, revised.  April exports were $2.2 billion more than
March exports of $173.4 billion.  April imports were $1.0
billion less than March imports of $220.2 billion.  In April, the goods deficit decreased $3.0 billion from
March to $58.1 billion, and the services surplus increased
$0.2 billion to $14.4 billion.  Exports of goods increased
$2.0 billion to $126.4 billion, and imports of goods
decreased $1.0 billion to $184.5 billion.  Exports of
services increased $0.2 billion to $49.1 billion, and
imports of services were virtually unchanged at $34.7
billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $2.2 billion from
April 2010 to April 2011.  Exports were up $27.8 billion,
or 18.8 percent, and imports were up $30.0 billion, or
15.9 percent.  Goods (Census Basis)  The March to April increase in exports of goods reflected
increases in industrial supplies and materials ($2.0
billion); capital goods ($1.2 billion); and  consumer goods 
($0.3 billion).   Decreases occurred in automotive
vehicles, parts,  and engines ($0.8 billion); other goods ($0.5 billion);
and foods, feeds, and beverages ($0.2 billion).  The March to April decrease in imports of goods reflected
decreases in automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($2.8
billion) and industrial supplies and materials ($1.5
billion). Increases occurred in consumer goods ($2.1
billion); capital goods ($0.6 billion); foods, feeds, and
beverages ($0.4 billion); and other goods ($0.2 billion).  The April 2010 to April 2011 increase in exports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials
($11.2 billion); capital goods ($5.1 billion); foods,
feeds, and beverages ($2.7 billion); consumer goods ($1.6
billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($1.4
billion); and other goods ($0.1 billion).  The April 2010 to April 2011 increase in imports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials
($11.4 billion); consumer goods ($6.1 billion); capital
goods ($5.7 billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and
engines ($1.6 billion); foods, feeds, and beverages ($1.5
billion); and other goods ($0.9 billion).  Services  Services exports increased $0.2 billion from March to
April.  The increase reflected increases in travel, other
private services (which includes items such as business,
professional, and technical services, insurance services,
and financial services), and passenger fares. Changes in
the other categories of services exports were small.  Services imports were virtually unchanged from March
to April.  Changes in all categories of services imports
were small and mostly offsetting.  The April 2010 to April 2011 increase in exports of
services was $5.3 billion.  The largest increases were in
other private services ($2.6 billion) and travel ($1.3
billion).  Within other private services, the largest
increases were in business, professional, and technical
services and financial services.  The April 2010 to April 2011 increase in imports of
services was $2.1 billion.  The largest increases were in
other private services ($0.7 billion) and travel ($0.5
billion).  Within other private services, the largest
increases were in business, professional, and technical
services and financial services.  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in April, exports of goods and
services averaged $171.4 billion, while imports of goods
and services averaged $216.9 billion, resulting in an
average trade deficit of $45.5 billion.  For the three
months ending in March, the average trade deficit was
$46.9 billion, reflecting average exports of $168.7
billion and average imports of $215.7 billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The April figures show surpluses, in billions of dollars,
with Hong Kong $2.6 ($2.7 for March), Singapore $1.2
($0.9), Australia $1.1 ($1.1), and Egypt $0.5 ($0.4).
Deficits were recorded, in billions of dollars, with China
$21.6 ($18.1), OPEC $9.6 ($10.8), European Union $7.5
($9.0), Mexico  $5.5    ($6.2),    Germany   $3.8
($4.6),   Japan   $3.6   ($6.1), Ireland $3.0 ($2.6),
Venezuela $2.8 ($3.0), Nigeria $2.5,           ($2.5),
Canada $2.5 ($2.6), Taiwan $1.2 ($0.6) and Korea $1.0
($0.6).  Advanced technology products exports were $23.0 billion in
April and imports were $30.1 billion, resulting in a
deficit of $7.0 billion.  April exports were $2.2 billion
less than the $25.3 billion in March, while April imports
were $2.1 billion less than the $32.2 billion in March.  Revisions  For March goods on a Census basis, not seasonally
adjusted, exports were revised up $0.3 billion and imports
were revised down $0.3 billion. Goods carry-over in April
was $0.2 billion (0.1 percent) for exports and $0.6
billion (0.3 percent) for imports.  For March, revised
export carry-over and revised import carry-over were
virtually zero.  For March goods on a balance of payment basis, exports
were revised down $0.5 billion and imports were revised
down $1.5 billion.  Services exports for March were revised up $1.2 billion to
$48.9 billion, mostly reflecting an upward revision in
royalties and license fees.  Services imports were revised
up $0.9 billion to $34.7 billion, mostly reflecting upward
revisions in royalties and license fees, other
transportation (which includes freight and port services),
and travel.  Goods and services exports and imports for all months
through March 2011 shown in this release reflect the
incorporation of annual revisions to the goods and
services series in the U.S. international transactions
accounts.  See the ``Notice'' in this release for a
description of major revisions to goods and services
exports and imports.  NOTICE
In this release and in the accompanying ``U.S.
International Trade in Goods and Services: Annual Revision
2010,'' the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA) are jointly publishing revised
statistics on both U.S. trade in goods and U.S. trade in
services beginning with 1999.  The revised statistics on
goods and services will also be included in the annual
revision of the U.S. international transactions accounts
(ITAs), which BEA will release on June 16, 2011.
The annual revision has not changed the overall trend in
the goods and services balance.  On an annual basis, the
goods and services deficit was revised less than 1 percent
for nearly all years; the exception was 2009, when it was
revised up 1.7 percent.  For 2010, the goods and services
deficit was revised up $4.3 billion, or 0.9 percent.  The
goods deficit was revised down for all years; the services
surplus was revised up for 1999-2007 and down for 2008-
2010.  Goods
The 2010 not seasonally adjusted Census-basis goods
statistics were revised to redistribute monthly data that
arrived too late for inclusion in the month of transaction
but that were included, initially, in the month in which
the data were received.  In addition, corrections were
made to previously published 2010 statistics.  Seasonal
and trading-day adjustments were then recalculated, and
the seasonally adjusted current-dollar series were revised
beginning with 2008.  The chain-weighted dollar series
were also revised beginning with statistics for 2008.
Balance of payments (BOP) adjustments - adjustments that
BEA applies to Census-basis goods exports and imports to
convert them to a BOP basis - were revised beginning with
statistics for 1999.  These adjustments are combined and
presented as ``Net Adjustments'' in this report.
Adjustments to low-value exports and imports were
introduced for 1999-2006 and were revised for 2007-2009.
BOP adjustments for goods procured in ports were revised
for exports beginning with statistics for 2007 and for
imports beginning with statistics for 2004.  BOP
adjustments that exhibit significant seasonal patterns are
now seasonally adjusted for both exports and imports
beginning with statistics for 1999.
Services
Beginning with statistics for 1999, the following items
were reclassified within the services accounts:  fees for
the rights to distribute film and television recordings
from other private services to royalties and license fees;
postal services from U.S. government miscellaneous
services to other transportation; and cruise fares from
passenger fares to travel (because cruise fares cover
onboard expenditures for goods and services similar to
land travel).  These reclassifications are part of a
multiyear effort to align the ITAs with the most recent
international guidelines for international economic
accounts.  Information about BEA's 2011 annual revision of
the ITAs and plans for implementing the new international
standards were presented in the May 2011 issue of the
Survey of Current Business.  Services exports were also revised because BEA has (1)
adopted a new method for measuring expenditures in the
 United States  of foreign residents who are working in the
United States for less than one year and (2) excluded
expenditures of foreign nationals who are working for
international organizations located in the United States
to more closely align with international guidelines.  Both
of these changes resulted in revisions beginning with
statistics for 1999.  Services imports were also revised
because BEA has implemented a new method for measuring non-
fuel expenditures of U.S. air carriers in foreign ports
beginning with statistics for 2004.  In addition to the changes described above, services
exports and imports were revised to incorporate updated
source data, including newly available data from BEA's
quarterly services surveys beginning with statistics for
2008 and initial results of BEA's benchmark survey of
international financial services transactions beginning
with statistics for 2007.  Changes to Countries
Effective with the release of May 2011 statistics on July
12, 2011, the U.S. International Trade in Goods and
Services report will be revised to reflect changes to
Netherlands Antilles. The new countries will be listed
individually in exhibit 6 of the FT-900 supplement and
added to the South/Central America country grouping in
exhibit 14 of the FT-900 and exhibit 6 of the FT-900
supplement.  Removed  Netherlands Antilles
