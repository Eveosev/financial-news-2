Linde AG (LIN)  has agreed to pay 35 million
euros ($51 million) to settle a corruption case in Munich, the
company said today.  The settlement is a reconciliation payment to offset gains
linked to wrongdoing at certain business partners, spokesman Uwe Wolfinger said in a telephone interview yesterday. Munich
authorities found no wrongdoing at Linde itself, Wolfinger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
