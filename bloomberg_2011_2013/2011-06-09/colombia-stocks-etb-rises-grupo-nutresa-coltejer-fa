The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:47 a.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.1 percent to 14,448.60, while the
Colcap Index fell 0.3 percent to 1,750.13.  Coltejer SA (COLTEJ)  , the Medellin-based clothing maker
and exporter, fell 2.4 percent, the most since March 18 on an
intraday basis, to 0.81 pesos. The company’s lack of a pension
fund for 3,000 former workers may have discouraged Fabricato SA
from participating in a potential merger, Dinero reported,
citing unidentified people within Coltejer. Company Chairman
Rafael Moises Kalach didn’t immediately respond to a request
from Bloomberg News for comment.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota SA (ETB CB), the
state-run phone company serving Colombia’s capital, rose 2.5
percent to 743 pesos. Claro Lopez, the opposition party leader
who was named by President Juan Manuel Santos yesterday as
acting mayor of Bogota, said a proposal to open the way for the
sale of the city’s shares in ETB will be submitted to the city
council tomorrow, Caracol reported.  Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA CB),  Colombia ’s biggest food
producer, fell the most in five years after the company said it
will sell 25 million shares at 20,900 pesos each, according to a
regulatory filing. Nutresa declined 6.9 percent to 23,300 pesos,
after earlier plunging 10 percent, the most on an intraday basis
since May 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
