Established local telephone companies
including  AT&T Inc. (T)  must share disputed parts of their networks
with competitors at cost, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled.  The unanimous  ruling  backs the position taken by the
Federal Communications Commission in a fight stemming from the
1996 law that injected competition into the local telephone
business. The law requires so-called incumbent local carriers,
whose ranks also include  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  and
 CenturyLink Inc. (CTL) , to share their facilities with rivals.  The ruling was a victory for Talk America Inc. in its fight
with AT&T’s Michigan Bell Telephone unit. The case centered on
so-called entrance facilities -- the wires or cables that
connect the networks of two carriers. AT&T argued unsuccessfully
that those lines aren’t covered by the 1996 law.  The case is Talk America v. Michigan Bell Telephone, 10-
313.  To contact the reporter on this story:
