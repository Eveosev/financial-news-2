The U.K.  Financial Services Authority 
defended rules requiring lenders to hold increased liquidity
buffers after banks complained that the rules were tougher than
international standards.  The FSA disagrees with claims that banks must “hold more
liquidity than is likely to be required under the implementation
of’’ global rules proposed by the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision , “and to date have not seen any evidence from firms
to suggest otherwise,” Liam Parker, an FSA spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The rules proposed by the FSA requiring banks to have
enough high-quality assets to survive a temporary liquidity
crisis could “cause disruption in the payment systems as banks
delay payments in an attempt to reduce liquidity usage,”
according to a paper published by  Bank of England  officials last
week.  The liquidity rules, which may require U.K. banks to buy as
much as 110 billion pounds ($161 billion) of  government bonds ,
were drafted partly in response to the near-collapse of Northern
Rock Plc, a lender that was nationalized in 2008.  The FSA sent a letter to U.K. banks outlining its position
on the liquidity rules, Sky News  reported  today.  The Basel Committee, a panel of regulators and central
bankers, has proposed minimum standards that would strengthen
both the amounts of liquidity and capital banks should hold.  To contact the reporters on this story:
