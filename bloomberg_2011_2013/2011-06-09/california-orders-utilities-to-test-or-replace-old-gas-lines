California  regulators ordered  PG&E
Corp. (PCG)  and other utilities to test old natural-gas pipelines or
replace them.  PG&E, owner of a gas line that exploded and killed eight
people in a  San Francisco  suburb, will need to submit a plan
within 60 days to test or install new transmission lines for
segments that lack sufficient safety records, the  California
Public Utilities Commission  said today at its regular meeting in
San Francisco.  The cost for PG&E to perform tests on how much pressure can
be placed on lines could range from $500 million to $1.75
billion over several years, Hugh Wynne, a utility analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a research note on May 12.  The 55-year-old pipeline that ruptured last September in
San Bruno, California, had welding flaws, federal investigators
have said. PG&E had also misidentified its construction design
and poor record keeping on pipelines could mean a line is
operated at a higher pressure than it is built to withstand,
investigators said.  Pipelines installed before 1962 were not required by state
law to have pressure testing.  PG&E, based in San Francisco, said has started to test 152
miles of gas lines near populated areas.  Sempra Energy (SRE) â€™s
Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric Co.
and  Southwest Gas Corp. (SWX)  will also have to submit pipeline plans,
the CPUC said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
