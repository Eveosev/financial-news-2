A “staggering” amount of money
stolen online may threaten national security and economic
stability, U.S. Attorney General  Eric Holder  said.  Advances in the sophistication of crimes involving
electronic networks are challenging  law enforcement , Holder said
in remarks prepared for delivery today at a cyber security
meeting in Hammond, Indiana.  “The staggering volume of money being stolen online today
has the potential to threaten not only the security of our
nation, but the integrity of our government, the stability of
our economy, and the safety of our people,” Holder said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
