Sony Corp. (6758)  restored video services
for users of its Qriocity entertainment network today after a
hacker attack led the company to suspend the operation.  Sony will bring back video on demand, resuming Qriocity
services entirely in all regions except  Japan , the Tokyo-based
company said in a statement today. Some music services which
hadnâ€™t been available when Sony restored partial access outside
 Asia  a week ago will also be available from today, it said.  Since the April attack, the maker of PlayStation consoles
has said it is also investigating possible theft of data on its
SonyPictures.com site, Brazilian music entertainment website and
Sony Computer Entertainment game operation. Sony said it
improved security this month after the initial intrusion led to
the theft of data on more than 100 million accounts for its
online services including Qriocity and the PlayStation Network.  Sony fell 1.6 percent to 2,005 yen as of the 11 a.m.
trading break in  Tokyo , compared with a 0.3 percent decline by
the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The stock has dropped 23
percent in the past two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
