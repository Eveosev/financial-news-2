London Underground  train drivers will
stage four strikes between June 19 and July 1 to protest the
firing of a colleague, the RMT union said.  The walkouts will last six hours to 24 hours each, covering
five morning and evening peak-travel periods, the union said in
an e-mailed statement today.  RMT  called the strikes over what it claims is the failure
of London Underground to reinstate Arwyn Thomas, a union
activist and train driver, after he won an interim ruling that
he’d been unfairly dismissed.  The strike is a result of “the intransigence of LU
management, who have dragged their heels and failed to reach
agreement over the past month,”  Bob Crow , the union’s general
secretary, said in the statement.  “It is completely mystifying that, having agreed with LU
that the tribunal process should take its course, the RMT is now
threatening strikes,” said a Transport for London spokeswoman,
who declined to be identified, citing agency policy.  The first strike will start at 9 p.m. on June 19 and last
for six hours. The second will start at the same time on June 27
and last until midday the following day. The third walkout will
last 24 hours, beginning at midday on June 29. The final strike
is scheduled to start at midday on July 1 and last nine hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
