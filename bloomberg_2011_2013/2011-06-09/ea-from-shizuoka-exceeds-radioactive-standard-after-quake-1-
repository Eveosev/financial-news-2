Tea from  Japan ’s Shizuoka prefecture
had above-standard radioactive cesium levels three months after
an earthquake led to radiation leaks at a nuclear plant about
360 kilometers (224 miles) from the area.  The dried leaves had 679 becquerels of cesium per kilogram,
more than the 500 becquerels per kilogram safety government
standard, according to a faxed statement from the local
government today. The contamination was found in leaves from the
prefecture’s Warashina area, while tea produced in all 18 other
areas had safe levels, based on tests conducted by tea farmers,
according to the statement.  Shizuoka Governor Heita Kawakatsu last month said tests on
fresh tea leaves and drinks showed they contained cesium amounts
below the government safety limit. The government on June 2
decided to curb shipments of dried tea leaves containing more
than 500 becquerel per kilogram of radioactive cesium and
ordered a halt in deliveries from the eastern prefectures of
Ibaraki, Chiba, Kanagawa and Tochigi where tainted produce was
detected.  Shizuoka, which accounts for about 40 percent of the
nation’s tea output and lies southwest of  Tokyo , asked the
farmers that produced the contaminated leaves to recall those
products and halt shipments.  Japan’s tea production, including fresh and dried leaves,
was worth 102.1 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in 2009, according to
the agriculture ministry.  Japan’s Nuclear Safety Commission on April 12 said an
estimated 630,000 terabecquerels of radiation had been released
into the atmosphere from the stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant
northeast of Tokyo. The country’s government the same day raised
the severity rating of the nuclear crisis to the highest level
on an international scale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
