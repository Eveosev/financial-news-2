Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in  Vietnam  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, rose 1 percent to 443.95.       Vincom Joint-Stock Co. (VIC VN), Vietnam’s biggest listed
property company, rose 2.7 percent to 113,000 dong. The Hanoi-
based company will pay a 2010 dividend of 5,880 dong, divided
into three tranches, between July 12 and Aug. 23, it said in a
statement on the exchange’s website.       Go Dang Seafood Joint-Stock Co. (AGD VN), a seafood
processor, declined 2.2 percent to 17,600 dong. The company
started listing an additional of 3.99 million shares today, it
said in a statement on the bourse’s website.       Danang Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (DRC VN) fell 3 percent, the
most since May 25, to 22,400 dong, the most since May 25. Rubber
declined for a second day as a strengthening Japanese currency
and the slow pace of the global economic recovery raised concern
that demand may weaken.  To contact the reporter on this story:
