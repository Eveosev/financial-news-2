Australis Seafoods SA  raised $71
million today in the third initial public offering by a Chilean
salmon farmer in six months as the industry rebounds from a
virus that cut output by 39 percent.  Australis, which put its first fish cages into the sea in
2008 when the local industry was reeling from an outbreak of
infectious salmon anemia, sold 180 million shares, or a 13
percent stake, at 185 pesos each to help it more than double
production, it said in a regulatory filing. The shares rose to
187.43 pesos, according to Santiago exchange data.  “We were born swimming against the current, gathering
experience from the industry and taking care of its
weaknesses,” Chief Executive Officer Andres Saint-Jean said in
an e-mailed response to questions on June 6.  The sale follows Cia. Pesquera Camanchaca SA’s $224 million
IPO in December and Empresas AquaChile SA’s $374 million share
sale last month. The industry is leading what may be a record
year of IPOs in Chile to replenish stocks lost to the virus and
meet rising salmon demand in emerging markets such as  Brazil .  Before today, Camanchaca’s shares had fallen 9.8 percent
since its December IPO compared with a 2.4 percent decline by
Chile’s benchmark index. AquaChile retreated 0.7 percent since
its May 19 share sale while the index rose 0.4 percent.  In all, Chilean companies plan to raise as much as $9.6
billion through the end of next year from IPOs and subsequent
offerings, according to Santiago-based brokerage IM Trust SA.
Seven companies may make their trading debuts this year, topping
a record five IPOs in 2005, IM Trust said.  Economic Growth  South America’s fifth-largest economy may grow as much as
6.5 percent this year, the fastest pace in more than a decade,
according to central bank forecasts published April 4  After the 2007 ISA virus outbreak,  Chile ’s production of
Atlantic and coho salmon and trout fell from a 2008 peak of
about 700,000 metric tons to 429,000 tons last year, according
to data from Australis’ IPO prospectus.  Since then, new rules covering distances between farms and
fallow periods, for example, helped reduce reported cases of the
virus to six this year from 160 in 2008, according to data from
industry regulator  Sernapesca .  Chile may increase its output of Atlantic salmon, the
variety most affected by ISA, to 300,000 tons by 2013 from
120,000 tons in 2010, according to June 1 report from Chardan
Capital Markets. Production of Atlantic salmon peaked at almost
400,000 tons in 2008.  Australis plans to spend $274 million to increase annual
salmon production to 80,000 tons by 2015 from an estimated
32,000 tons this year, Saint-Jean said.  Salmon Industry Recovery  The prospect of a recovery in Chile has helped push down
international salmon prices this year, according to UBS AG. The
price of Norwegian exported fresh salmon has fallen 17 percent
year-to-date after a 41 percent increase in 2010.  “There is concern that a steep Chile recovery may impact
pricing, making it less profitable than some of the farmers had
initially hoped,” said David Kerstens, a London-based analyst
at UBS, which follows Norwegian salmon farmers.  Demand from new markets such as Brazil may help counter the
supply effect on prices for now, he said.  Only Chile can increase supply to meet growing demand by
doubling capacity in the coming years, said Eric Conrads, who
helps manage $12 billion in emerging markets stocks at ING
Investment Management in  New York , including salmon producers.  The salmon farmer IPOs are a positive for Chile in the
longer term, said Adam Kutas, who oversees $4 billion in Latin
American shares for  Fidelity Investments .  “It’s bringing a very key industry back to profitability
and stability after going through several tough years,” Kutas
said in a June 7 telephone interview. He declined to comment on
whether he would buy Australis shares.  -- Editors: James Attwood, Richard Richtmyer  To contact the reporter on this story:
