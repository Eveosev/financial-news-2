Rich Peverley scored twice and Tim Thomas made 38 saves as the  Boston Bruins  defeated the  Vancouver 
Canucks 4-0 to tie the  National Hockey League ’s Stanley Cup
Final at two games each.  The Bruins have rallied from a two-game deficit in the
best-of-seven series, which resumes with Game 5 in Vancouver
tomorrow.  Peverley opened the scoring with a goal after 11 minutes,
59 seconds at TD Garden in Boston last night, and added a second
goal 3:39 into the third period.  Michael Ryder  and Brad Marchand
got the other goals just over two minutes apart in the second
period.  “Anyone who knows the story of Tim Thomas, he’s taken a
real bumpy road to get to the NHL,” Bruins coach Claude Julien
told reporters. “He’s had so many obstacles to overcome. It
makes him a battler, it makes him the perfect goaltender for our
organization.”  Canucks goalie Roberto Luongo was replaced after giving up
 Boston ’s fourth goal. After allowing two goals in two games in
Vancouver, Luongo gave up 12 goals in less than two games in
Boston.  “It was a tough one,” Luongo told reporters. “Three of
the goals went off something and in. Obviously, we’re not
getting the breaks so it’s just a matter of staying focused.
We’ve got home ice advantage for a reason.”  The Canucks lost on their two previous trips to the Stanley
Cup Final in 1982 and 1994. The Bruins have been beaten five
times in the championship series, most recently in 1990, since
they collected the last of their five NHL titles in 1972.  To contact the reporter on this story:
