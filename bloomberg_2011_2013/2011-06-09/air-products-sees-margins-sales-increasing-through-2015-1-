Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (APD) , the
second-biggest U.S. industrial-gas producer, said profit margins
will expand 3 percentage points through 2015 and sales will rise
about 12 percent annually, led by growth in energy and
electronics markets.  Revenue will climb to more than $15 billion in fiscal 2015,
from $9 billion in the year ended in September, for an annual
growth rate of 11 percent to 13 percent, Chief Executive Officer
John McGlade said today in a presentation to investors in  New
York . Operating profit will rise to 20 percent by then, from 17
percent in the last quarter, the Allentown, Pennsylvania-based
company said in a statement.  Air Products plans to leverage its leading positions in
hydrogen, used to produce low-sulfur fuels, and gases used to
make electronics to exceed anticipated annual industry growth of
9 percent, Chief Financial Officer Paul Huck said in the
presentation. The company, thwarted this year in a $5.9 billion
hostile bid for Airgas Inc., also plans to make acquisitions
boosting sales as much as 2 percent a year, he said.  “Air Products investor day set targets slightly better
than expected, with a balance between growth targets and a theme
of secular productivity gains,” Laurence Alexander, a New York-
based analyst at Jefferies & Co. who rates the shares “buy,”
said today in a note.  Analysts project sales to rise 11 percent in the fiscal
year through September to $9.99 billion and 9 percent to $10.9
billion the following year, according to average estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  Air Products rose $1.85, or 2 percent, to $92.65 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 1.9 percent this year.  Praxair Inc. (PX) , based in Danbury,  Connecticut , is the biggest
U.S. industrial-gas producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
