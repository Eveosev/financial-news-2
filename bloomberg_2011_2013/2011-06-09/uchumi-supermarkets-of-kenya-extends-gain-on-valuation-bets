Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., a Kenyan
retailer that resumed trading last week after a five-year
suspension due to bankruptcy, rose for the third day on
speculation it is undervalued relative to peers.  The shares climbed 9.8 percent to 11.25 shillings by 11:36
a.m. in the capital, Nairobi, the highest intraday price since
June 2. That pared its decline since it resumed trading to 22
percent. The company trades on a multiple of 4.8 times reported
earnings, compared with 14.7 times reported profit for the MSCI
Frontier Markets index.  “There is a bit of bargain buying after it hit 10
shillings,” George Bodo, an analyst with Nairobi-based Genghis
Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “The price surge
is short term because price discovery is not yet over and we
will see a bit of volatility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
