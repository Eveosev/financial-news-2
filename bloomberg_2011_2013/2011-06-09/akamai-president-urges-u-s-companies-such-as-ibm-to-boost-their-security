Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM)  President
David Kenny said U.S. companies need to be more vigilant with
network security.  Such businesses should be investing more time and money
into security measures to keep pace with the growth of the
Internet and the explosion of cloud technology, he said in an
interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. Security is a
“very fast-growing” part of Akamai, and most cyber attacks on
the U.S. are coming from outside the country, he said.  “It’s not sexy,” Kenny said. “It’s like buying
insurance. Really smart hackers have had a decade to figure out
how to hack firewalls.”  Akamai, which provides server space that helps websites
load faster, is striving to reach annual sales of $10 billion,
Kenny said. The company is focusing on cloud security, or
monitoring data delivered over the Internet. Akamai doesn’t have
enough developers to keep up with the growth in cloud and the
increasing customer demand, he said.  Akamai, based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , fell 22 cents to
$30.04 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have declined 36 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
