LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) ,
the worldâ€™s largest maker of luxury goods, does not intend to
bid for  Hermes International (RMS)  SCA, the bag maker in which it
holds a 20.2 percent stake, an LVMH spokesman said.  LVMH may be preparing to bid 350 euros a share for Paris-
based Hermes, the Daily Mail reported today, without saying
where it got the information. Hermes shares rose 2.2 percent to
close at 191.95 euros today in Paris trading, giving it a market
value of 20.3 billion euros ($29.4 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
