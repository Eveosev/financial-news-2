Snowpack in the  Rocky Mountains  has
been decreasing for five years because of hotter temperatures, a
study tracking 800 years of data indicated, suggesting water
supplies in the Western U.S. may be reduced.  The  U.S. Geological Survey  in  Montana  used a network of 66
tree-ring chronologies to determine that layers of snow formed
in cold areas in the region decreased in the late 20th century
more than any other period since 1200, according to a study
published today in the journal Science.  Snowpack in both the northern and southern sections of the
Rockies are now declining at the same time, which may mean that
higher temperatures and not shifting precipitation rates may be
causing the change, the researchers said. Through the 1980s,
levels rose and fell in each area.  Runoff from the snow in the Rockies feeds the  Colorado ,
Columbia and Missouri rivers, the primary water sources of more
than 70 million people, the study said. That melting snow
accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of the water supply in
those areas.  The National Ski Areas Association said  last month  that
snowfall at resorts during the 2010-2011 season was up 27
percent from the last season.  Snowfall was the highest recorded in 20 years with some
resorts staying open beyond normal closing dates. Aspen
Mountain, a ski resort owned by Aspen Skiing Co. in Colorado,
 reopened  last weekend and plans to remain open for additional
weekends as conditions allow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
