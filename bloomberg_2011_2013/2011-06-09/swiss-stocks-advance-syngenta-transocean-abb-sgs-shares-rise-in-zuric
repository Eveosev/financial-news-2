Swiss stocks increased, rebounding
from a 2 1/2 month low, as European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet signaled that the bank will raise  interest rates 
next month to contain inflation.  Syngenta AG, the world’s biggest producer of crop-
protection chemicals, gained 2 percent. Straumann Holding AG, a
dental implant maker, slumped 2.1 percent.  The Swiss Market Index of the biggest and most actively
traded companies climbed 0.3 percent to 6,277.5 at 3:55 p.m. in
Zurich. Even so, the measure has fallen 6.9 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 18 as U.S. manufacturing and payroll reports
fueled concern that the recovery in the world’s largest economy
is faltering. The broader Swiss Performance Index also increased
0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
