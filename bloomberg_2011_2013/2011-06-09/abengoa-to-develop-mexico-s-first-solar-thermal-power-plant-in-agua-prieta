Abengoa SA (ABG) , the world’s largest
developer of solar thermal plants, plans to build  Mexico ’s first
solar-thermal power plant as part of a gas-fueled combined cycle
project in the northern state of Sonora.  The Spanish group will build a 12-megawatt solar field
using parabolic trough technology in Agua Prieta for the Mexican
Federal Electricity Commission, it said today in an e-mail. The
plant is expected to start operating in 22 months.  The plant will be one of the first solar and gas-fired
hybrid power plants in the world. In such plants, parabolic
mirrors concentrate solar energy to heat liquids and power the
same turbines used at the much-larger gas power plant.  Abengoa commissioned two plants of the same type in Morocco
and Algeria last year and  Germany ’s  Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  opened a
20-megawatt facility near a 130-megawatt gas project in
December.  The Mexican solar project will be followed by a gas power
plant comprising two gas turbines with a total of 464.4
megawatts in capacity, the company said. The solar element will
be supported by the Global Environment Facility of the United
Nations’ Development Program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
