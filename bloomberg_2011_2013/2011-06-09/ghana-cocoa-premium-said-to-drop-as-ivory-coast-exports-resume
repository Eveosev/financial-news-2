The premium buyers are prepared to
pay to secure cocoa from  Ghana , the world’s second-largest
producer, is declining after exports resumed from neighboring
Ivory Coast, according to three people involved in the trade.  Ghanaian beans are trading in Europe at 110 pounds to 125
pounds ($180 to $205) a metric ton above the price on the NYSE
Liffe exchange in London, compared with 140 pounds three weeks
ago, according to the traders, who declined to be identified
because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media.  “African cocoa premiums are generally sliding,” said
Jonathan Parkman, joint-head of agriculture at Marex Financial
Ltd. in London. “That has quite a lot to do with the freeing up
of cocoa in the Ivory Coast. The situation is gradually
normalizing for the cocoa sector.”  Supplies from  Ivory Coast  were disrupted in January after
President  Alassane Ouattara  ordered a ban on cocoa exports to
cut off funds to former leader  Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to
cede power after losing a Nov. 28 election. Gbagbo was captured
on April 11 and Ouattara ended the ban by April 15.  Cocoa deliveries to ports in Ivory Coast rose 90 percent to
38,390 tons in the week ended May 29 compared with the same
period a year earlier, a document obtained from the industry’s
regulator showed.  Ivory Coast’s crop will be 1.3 million tons in the year
that started Oct. 1, and compares with output of 960,000 tons in
Ghana, according to the International Cocoa Organization. Ivory
Coast’s crop will be 4.7 percent bigger and Ghana’s 52 percent
larger, ICCO estimates show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
