Southern Cross  Healthcare Plc’s plans
to relinquish control of 132 of its 752 care homes, the
Financial Times reported, citing documents distributed to its
landlords. The documents said there were 47 care homes that
Southern Cross “does not wish to retain due to demographic
and/or financial reasons,” and will return to landlords by
Sept. 30, the FT said. Southern Cross intends to withdraw from
85 more care homes by 2016, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
