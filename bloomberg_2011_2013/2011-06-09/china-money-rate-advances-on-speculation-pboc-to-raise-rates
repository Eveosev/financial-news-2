China ’s money-market rate rose to the
highest level this month on speculation the central bank will
lift interest rates to help damp inflation.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, jumped for a second day even as the
central bank kept the yield on one-year bills unchanged at
2.9168 percent today for a ninth week, according to a statement
from the monetary authority. The People’s Bank of China issued
27 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) of the securities and sold 10
billion yuan of 91-day  repurchase agreements .  “The market is worried more tightening measures will come
and inflation may accelerate in May and June,” said Liu Junyu,
a Shenzhen-based bond analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the
nation’s sixth-largest lender. “The cash shortage has caused
panic in the market. It’s very likely the central bank will
raise  interest rates  this weekend or around the end of June or
the beginning of July.”  The seven-day repo rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, gained 32 basis points to 4.14 percent as of the
4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average
rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  A government report on June 14 will show consumer prices
rose 5.5 percent in May from a year earlier, the fastest pace
since July 2008, according to the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey. The central bank added a net 87
billion yuan of capital into the financial system this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, were little
changed at 3.48 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.94 percent government bond due January
2021 climbed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
3.87 percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
