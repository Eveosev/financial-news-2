Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the world’s largest
independent merger adviser, said it hired Alan Patterson from
Amias Berman & Co. LLP and four other bankers to start a new
structured credit advisory business in London.  Patterson joins as a managing director, running a group
that also includes former Amias Berman staff Andrew Feachem,
Juan Carlos Martorell and Aman Panaech as directors, Lazard said
today in a statement. Abror Ismailov joins from Union Investment
Group as a vice president.  The team will advise clients across  Europe  and work
alongside Lazard’s financial institutions and real estate units,
William Rucker, chief executive officer of Lazard London, said
in the statement.  Patterson started his investment banking career at Merrill
Lynch & Co. in 1989. He set up Citigroup Inc.’s capital
management strategy group in 2006, providing balance sheet
advice to financial institutions, Lazard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
