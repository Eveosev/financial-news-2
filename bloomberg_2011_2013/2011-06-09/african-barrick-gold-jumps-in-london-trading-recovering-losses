African Barrick Gold Plc, the largest
producer of the metal in Tanzania, rose the most in two months
in London trading after dismissing concerns its operations in
the African country may be affected by increased taxes.  African Barrick climbed 10 pence, or 2.4 percent, to 425
pence by the 4:30 p.m. close, the biggest gain since April 8.  The shares dropped 7.8 percent yesterday after Tanzania’s
national planning commission recommended the government consider
a so-called super-profit tax on the  mining industry .  “The tax treatment of our existing operations is, and will
continue to be, that set out in the respective Mineral
Development Agreements,” London-based African Barrick said in a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
