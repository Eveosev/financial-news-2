European Central Bank council member
 Yves Mersch  said “delusions” about debt restructuring or a
splintering of the 17-nation monetary union undermine trust in
the  euro .  “Delusions about the restructuring of public debt or the
exit of a country from the  euro zone  nourish mistrust in the
common currency,” Mersch said in the introduction to the 2010
annual report of the Luxembourg Central Bank, which he heads.
“Such a threat to its credibility risks making the refinancing
of our future more difficult.”  After an improvement in the first quarter, euro-zone
economies “risk slowing down under the combined effect of
multiple factors, external and internal,” Mersch wrote in the
report.  “The crisis we’re going through since 2007 has gravely
affected the banking sector, beyond national systems,” he said.
“The relevant response to the crisis is an intensification of
the European construction.”  The common well-being in the economic and monetary union is
challenged when a member nation doesn’t respect the rules, said
Mersch.  “That’s why the union must have stronger automatic
sanctioning mechanisms and rules at its disposal,” said Mersch.
“It’s up to the European governance to act with regard to
national mechanisms and institutions that don’t comply with the
monetary region’s stability, such as the automatic indexation of
salaries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
