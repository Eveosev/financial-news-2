Germany ’s data-protection  watchdog 
says Facebook Inc.’s facial-recognition feature for photo
tagging violates people’s ability to control their own
information,  Handelsblatt  reported.  The technology could lead to a “dangerous” collection of
data, Handelsblatt cited Bernhard Freund, a consultant at the
Hamburg-based data protection agency, as saying.  The agency is calling on the government to take action
against the feature, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
