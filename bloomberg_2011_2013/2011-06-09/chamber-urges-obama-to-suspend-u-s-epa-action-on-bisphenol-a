The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the
nation’s biggest business lobby, is asking the Obama
administration to suspend plans for listing the chemical
bisphenol A among substances that may harm the environment.  The  Environmental Protection Agency  said last year it would
study the effects of Bisphenol A, or BPA, which has been used
for decades to make baby bottles and plastic food containers,
and consider including it on its “concern list.”  The chamber, representing more than 3 million companies and
organizations, said the EPA lacks the scientific backing needed
to list the chemical. The Washington-based group also said the
agency hasn’t weighed the economic effects of listing.  “There is no evidence that EPA has considered economic
cost and jobs impact of its actions,” Bill Kovacs, the
chamber’s senior vice president of environment, technology and
regulatory affairs, wrote June 7 to Cass Sunstein, head of the
White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  Meg Reilly, a spokeswoman at the White House Office of
Management and Budget, said the administration will consider the
chamber’s request.  “We are reviewing this letter now and, as with all
comments received from the public, will give it careful
consideration,” Reilly said in a statement.  EPA spokesmen didn’t respond to requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
