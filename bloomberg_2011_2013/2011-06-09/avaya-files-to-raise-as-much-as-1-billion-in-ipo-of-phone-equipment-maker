Avaya Holdings Corp., the phone-
equipment maker owned by private equity firms Silver Lake and
TPG Capital, seeks to raise as much as $1 billion in an initial
public offering, according to a regulatory filing.  Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
& Co. are leading the IPO, Avaya said in a filing today with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company didn’t
disclose how many shares it will sell or give a price range in
the filing.  Proceeds will be used to repay long-term debt, redeem
preferred stock and pay fees to sponsors, the prospectus showed.
The company, which sells phones and related equipment to
corporate clients, bought Nortel Networks Corp.’s enterprise-
telecommunications unit for $915 million in 2009, gaining more
corporate phone equipment.  Avaya, based in  Basking Ridge ,  New Jersey , was spun off
from Lucent Technologies Inc. in 2000 and taken private in 2007
for $8.2 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
