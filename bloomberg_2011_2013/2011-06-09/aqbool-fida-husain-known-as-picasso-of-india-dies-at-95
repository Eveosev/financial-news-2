Maqbool Fida Husain, an Indian
contemporary painter, who has been called the Picasso of
 India , has died. He was 95.  Husain, who mostly avoided wearing footwear, was born in
the western Indian state of Maharashtra and started his career
painting movie posters and billboards. He had no formal training
in art, according to his  website . He died in London at 2:30 a.m.
local time, said Sahba Husain, his daughter-in-law. The cause of
death isn’t known yet, she said.  The painter had been living overseas, mostly in London,
following a 2006 court case where Hindu fundamentalist groups
alleged that Husain denigrated Hindu goddesses by painting them
nude. He renounced his Indian citizenship and went for a self-
imposed exile. He accepted an offer to become a citizen of Qatar
in January 2010.  “He was the face of Indian art,” Usha Gawde, manager at
 Sakshi Gallery  said in a phone interview from Mumbai. “He took
Indian art to the forefront. It is unfortunate that he had to
force himself to exile during the last phase of his career.”  India’s  Supreme Court  in 2008 threw out the petition
calling for his trial on criminal charges including for what the
groups called were disrespectful pictures of Bharat Mata, or
mother India, and Hindu gods and goddesses.  “For the last 2,500 years, Indian art has flourished,”
Husain said in an interview in 2008. “It cannot be stopped by
any force. Art is the identity of a nation.”  During the early part of his career Husain used to design
and build toys to supplement his income. He held his first
exhibition in 1947. India’s government bestowed him with the
fourth-highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, in 1966.  ‘National Loss’  Husain’s “Battle of Ganga and Jamuna” painted in 1971,
fetched $1.6 million, the most for his art, at an  auction  by
Christie’s International in  London . In June last year, his “8
Horses,” fetched $442,750.  Husain, born on Sept. 15, 1915, in Pandharpur, also
produced and directed movies starring Bollywood actresses. His
movie “Through the Eyes of a Painter” won the Golden Bear
award at the Berlin Film Festival in 1967.  He was a special invitee along with Picasso at a 1971 art
exhibition in  Brazil . In 2005, UBS AG,  Switzerland ’s biggest
bank, sponsored an exhibition of 21 Husain paintings in
 Singapore .  Indian Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  called his death a
“national loss.” The Forbes  magazine  named him the Picasso of
India in 2005.  To contact the reporters on this story:
