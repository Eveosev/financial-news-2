European stocks were little changed
after six days of losses as declines in retailers and banks
offset gains in utilities. Asian shares fell, while U.S. index
futures rose.  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME)  plunged the most in 2 1/2 years after
sales at its Argos chain declined.  Elekta AB (EKTAB)  rallied 2.9 percent
as the world’s second-largest maker of radiation-treatment
equipment reported earnings that topped estimates. Suez
Environnement SA advanced 2.1 percent as JPMorgan Chase & Co.
upgraded the shares.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose less than 0.1 percent to
269.04 at 1:46 p.m. in  London  after earlier rising as much as
0.6 percent. The measure has fallen 7.6 percent from this year’s
high on Feb. 17 and is trading at about 12.8 times its
companies’ reported earnings, the cheapest valuation since 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s room for a technical rebound, but it remains just
that,” said Vincent Guenzi, a  fund manager  at Cholet-Dupont
Gestion SA in Paris, which oversees $2.9 billion. “We don’t see
a new upswing because there isn’t a motor.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.4 percent today, while
futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.2 percent,
indicating the gauge will rebound from a 2 1/2 month low.  The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday after European markets
closed that the economy expanded at a “steady pace” in most of
the U.S., while slowing in 4 of 12 regions as consumers
contended with higher food and fuel prices and shortages of
parts reduced car production.  Slow Recovery  The report underscores Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s statement
on June 7 that the central bank should maintain record stimulus
to bolster a “frustratingly slow” recovery. He predicted that
the economy will pick up in the second half of the year as
energy prices moderate and factory disruptions ease as suppliers
of parts from  Japan  recover from an earthquake and tsunami.  A report showed U.S. applications for unemployment
insurance payments unexpectedly rose last week, a sign that the
labor market is struggling to gain traction. Jobless claims
increased by 1,000 to 427,000 in the week ended June 4,
according to the Labor Department.  The  European Central Bank  kept its benchmark interest rate
at 1.25 percent today, while the  Bank of England  held its key
rate at 0.5 percent and left its bond-purchase program unchanged
at 200 billion pounds ($328 billion).  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled the bank intends
to raise interest rates next month, saying “strong vigilance” is
warranted to contain inflation.  Home Retail  Home Retail tumbled 13 percent to 177 pence, its biggest
drop since December 2008, after the retailer said revenue at
Argos stores open at least a year fell 9.6 percent in the 13
weeks ended May 28. Shore Capital analyst Ramona Tipnis had
estimated a 4 percent drop.  Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS) , Europe’s largest electronics retailer,
plunged 12 percent to 17 pence.  Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA) , the third
biggest, fell 1.7 percent to 140.3 pence.  Elekta rallied 2.9 percent to 266 kronor. The maker of
radiation-treatment equipment said fourth-quarter net income
rose to 531 million kronor ($86 million) from 476 million kronor
a year earlier. Analysts had estimated profit of 522 million
kronor, according to a survey compiled by Bloomberg.  Suez Environnement advanced 2.1 percent to 14.28 euros as
the stock was raised to “overweight” from “neutral” at
JPMorgan. A measure of utilities had the biggest gain among 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Club Mediterranee (CU)  SA surged 3.7 percent to 15.92 euros. The
French holiday resort operator said first-half net income rose
to 10 million euros ($14.6 million) from 3 million euros.  Halfords Group Plc (HFD)  advanced 3.1 percent to 410.3 pence. The
U.K. seller of car parts and bicycles said profit rose 11
percent to 85.5 million pounds in the year ended March 31 as
improved margins offset a squeeze on  consumer spending .  To contact the reporter on this story:
