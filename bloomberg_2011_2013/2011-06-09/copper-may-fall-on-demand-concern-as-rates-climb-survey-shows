Copper may fall on speculation
demand will weaken as economies struggle to maintain the pace of
growth and central banks raise  interest rates , a survey showed.  Seven of 14 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 50 percent, said prices will drop next week. Six
predicted a gain and one forecast little change. Copper for
three-month delivery was down 0.4 percent for this week at
$9,060 a metric ton by 5:20 p.m. yesterday on the  London  Metal
Exchange.  Industrial production unexpectedly declined in Germany, the
world’s third-biggest copper user in 2010, and initial claims
for jobless benefits in the U.S. rose after economists predicted
a drop, figures showed this week. The European Central Bank
yesterday signaled an interest-rate increase in July. Borrowing
costs rose last month from  Norway  to  India .  “The copper market seems to be in a medium-term downtrend
now as a deteriorating economic climate weighs on prices,” said
 William Adams , an analyst at Basemetals.com in London.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of June 3.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
68 of the past 140 weeks, or 49 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bearish: 7 Bullish: 6 Hold: 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
