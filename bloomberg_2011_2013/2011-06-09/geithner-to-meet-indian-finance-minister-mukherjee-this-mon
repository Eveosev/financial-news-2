U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  will meet with Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
in Washington this month as part of a series of talks between
the countries.  The second U.S.-India Economic and Financial Partnership
meetings will be held June 27-28, the Treasury Department said
on its website today. Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao will be among officials attending the talks, the
department said.  Growth in India’s $1.4 trillion economy, Asia’s third-
largest, declined to 7.8 percent last quarter, the lowest pace
since 2009. Manufacturing and the service sector slowed after
the central bank raised interest rates to curb inflation.
Companies including  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the country’s
largest carmaker, have reported slowing sales growth as rising
borrowing costs and costlier fuel hurt consumer demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
