The first hurricane of the U.S.
season in the eastern Pacific is likely to strengthen off the
shore of  Mexico  tonight or tomorrow, the National Hurricane
Center said.  The storm, named Adrian, is moving west-northwest at almost
12 miles (19 kilometers) an hour, with maximum winds of about 90
mph, the Miami-based agency said in a public  advisory  on its
website at 2 a.m. Los Angeles time.  “This general motion is expected to continue, with some
decrease in forward speed during the next couple of days,” the
agency said. “The center of Adrian would remain well offshore
of southwestern Mexico.”  Adrian is a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
hurricane wind scale, according to the agency. “Additional
strengthening is forecast during the next 24 or 36 hours, and
Adrian could become a major hurricane tonight or Friday.”
Adrian reached hurricane status when winds hit 74 mph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
