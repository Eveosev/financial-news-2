Middle East crude oil grades for sale
to  Asia  fell versus their benchmarks after producers raised
their official prices to the highest in almost three years,
limiting demand from refiners.  Murban for August loading, produced by Abu Dhabi National
Oil Co., dropped 2 cents to a premium of 8 cents a barrel above
its official selling price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Qatar Land dropped 2 cents to a discount of 1 cent a
barrel below its official level, the least since Feb. 15,
Bloomberg data showed.  Both Abu Dhabi National and  Qatar Petroleum  issued new
official prices that are at the highest levels since July 2008
when compared with the benchmark Dubai crude price from
publishing service Platts. The Land grade’s premium to Dubai for
last month rose to $4.27 a barrel, according to Bloomberg
calculations. Murban’s difference climbed to $5.22 a barrel. The
higher levels mean that refiners see both types as expensive
relative to other Mideast grades.  Oman crude for immediate loading rose $1.95, or 1.8
percent, to $111.97 barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in August rose 1.8 percent to
$111.51. Murban increased 1.7 percent to $116.28.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July widened 27
cents to $7.07 a barrel, PVM said. The exchange for swaps for
August climbed 22 cents to $6.77 a barrel.  Oman futures for August delivery fell 50 cents to $111.25 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:26 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,282 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$111.63 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
