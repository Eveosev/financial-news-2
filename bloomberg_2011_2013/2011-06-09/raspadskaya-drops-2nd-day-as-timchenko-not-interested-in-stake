OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)  fell for a second day
after Russian billionaire  Gennady Timchenko ’s spokesman said the
businessman isn’t interested in acquiring a stake in the coal
producer.  The shares dropped as much as 4.6 percent before closing 1
percent lower at 167.17 rubles by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow.  Neither Timchenko nor affiliated companies are holding
talks on buying shares in Raspadskaya, Timchenko’s external
spokesman Anton Kurevin said today in an e-mailed statement.  Kurevin was commenting on reports in the past two weeks
that Timchenko, a co-founder of the Gunvor Group, may seek to
buy the Raspadskaya stake.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
