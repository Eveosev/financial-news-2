Alexander Kotchoubey, executive vice
president responsible for the Russian market at Lombard Odier
Darier Hentsch & Cie, left the firm to “pursue other
projects.”  Kotchoubey departed last month after more than four years
at Geneva’s oldest private bank, he said by telephone. François
Mutter, a spokesman for Lombard Odier, declined to comment on
the circumstances of the departure. Kotchoubey joined the firm
in 2008 from Renaissance Investment Management, where he was
deputy chief executive officer.  The Swiss bank opened an office in the Russian capital two
years ago to target the $20 billion in funds that Kotchoubey
estimated wealthy Russians held onshore. The company hired
Stéphane Ulcakar as senior vice president of the Moscow office
from  Boston Consulting Group  earlier this month, Vedomosti
newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  Lombard Odier competes with foreign banks including Credit
Suisse AG,  UBS AG (UBSN) , Deutsche Bank AG and Union Bancaire Privée to
manage Russians’ wealth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
