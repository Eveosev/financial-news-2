Ahnlab Inc. (053800) , South Korea’s biggest
anti-virus software maker, tumbled by the daily limit in  Seoul 
after its founder withdrew from the country’s presidential race.  The stock sank 15 percent to 35,250 won on the Korea
Exchange, the lowest close since Sept. 27, 2011. The tech-laden
Kosdaq Index, where Ahnlab is listed, dropped 0.5 percent.  Ahnlab founder and independent candidate Ahn Cheol Soo
withdrew from next month’s presidential election and will back
the main opposition’s nominee, Moon Jae In, presenting a single
challenger to the ruling New Frontier Party. Ahnlab shares
surged to a record on Jan. 4 on speculation Ahn would run for
president.  “The stock has now fallen to the level where Ahn fever
started to take off in 2011,” Min Kim, an analyst at Hyundai
Securities Co., said by telephone today. “Those who made bets
that the company would benefit from ties to Ahn if he got
elected have been disappointed, and sentiment is unlikely to
improve anytime soon.”  NFP candidate Park Geun Hye, who is seeking to become the
first female leader of Asia’s fourth-biggest economy, led in
previous polls for a three-way race and is ahead in the latest
survey for a two-way contest with Moon. The pair will have to
contend with rising household debt in South Korea and have vowed
to boost jobs and reduce the income gap.  Sunny Electronics Corp. (004770) , whose vice president previously
worked for Ahnlab, also slumped by the 15 percent daily limit,
to close at 2,190 won today. Shinwoo Co., where Park’s sister-
in-law once served as a non-executive director, rallied 15
percent to 1,480 won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
