Chrysler Group LLC, which has led
the U.S. minivan market since introducing the first model almost
30 years ago, is adding a higher-end version of the Town &
Country as the automaker considers its future in the segment.  The 2013 Town & Country S, equipped with a Blu-ray DVD
player as a standard feature, arrives in dealerships by June and
will sell for a $2,000 premium to the base model, said Bruce
Velisek, the head of the Chrysler brand marketing. Chrysler
unveils the minivan this week at the Los Angeles Auto Show.  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of Chrysler and
its majority owner  Fiat SpA (F) , has said he’s evaluating whether
the U.S. automaker needs both the Town & Country and Dodge Grand
Caravan. The U.S. minivan segment shrank to 3.7 percent of U.S.
light-vehicle sales last year from 7.9 percent in 2000,
according to researcher Autodata Corp.  “We have spent an inordinate amount of time looking at
that market,” Marchionne, 60, said of minivans during a Nov. 15
press conference at a Chrysler engine plant in  Detroit . “I’ve
run more clinics on models than God knows. We’ve been doing this
now for over a year.”  The Town & Country will join the Chrysler 200 sedan and
convertible and the 300 sedan in having an S-edition version.
The model will sell for $31,995 before delivery and other fees,
Velisek told reporters during a Nov. 2 briefing at the company’s
headquarters in  Auburn Hills ,  Michigan . The Town & Country
starts at $29,995 for the Touring model and $39,995 for the
Limited edition, according to the company’s  website .  Town & Country deliveries climbed 22 percent to 95,850 this
year through October, according to  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-
based Autodata. Sales of the Dodge Grand Caravan rose 28 percent
to 118,730.  To contact the reporter on this story:
