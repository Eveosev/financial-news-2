Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the second-biggest maker
of mobile phones in the world, unveiled two models to meet
growing demand from consumers in  Asia  who want features common
on more expensive smartphones.  The Asha 205 has a keyboard and a dedicated Facebook
button, while the Asha 206 has a 2.4 inch display and access to
Facebook and Twitter from the home-screen, Espoo, Finland-based
Nokia said today in a statement. Both phones cost $62 and will
start shipping this year.  Nokia, which reported its sixth consecutive quarter of
losses last month, is depending on its Asha line of mobile
phones to help win over first-time users and increase the
chances of them buying more expensive phones in the future.  The new devices are targeted at “super-social” consumers,
Timo Toikkanen, Nokia’s head of mobile phones, said in the
statement. One feature, Slam, allows users to share multimedia
with nearby friends almost instantly with the help of Bluetooth
technology.  Unlike its smartphone division, Nokia’s basic-phone
business is profitable. The company had a 19.2 percent mobile
phone market share last quarter after selling 82 million
devices, according to Gartner Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. sold
98 million phones, giving it a 22.9 percent share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
