India ’s rupee fell to a two-month
low, erasing earlier gains, before a report this week that is
forecast to show economic growth will stay near a three-year low.  Asia ’s third-largest economy  expanded  5.5 percent in the
three months through September from a year earlier, Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram predicted on Nov. 24, matching
the growth rate in the preceding quarter. Economists forecast a
5.2 percent increase, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey before the data due on Nov. 30. That would
match the pace in the first quarter that was the slowest since
the three months through March 2009.  The rupee declined 0.2 percent to 55.6250 per dollar as of
10:55 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 55.6750, the weakest level since Sept. 6. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange-
rates used to price options, was unchanged at 9.50 percent.  “The rupee remains the major underperformer, with the
currency continuing to suffer from domestic considerations, and
benefitting the least from any improvement in risk appetite,”
 Mitul Kotecha , Hong Kong-based head of foreign-exchange strategy
at  Credit Agricole , wrote in a research report today.  The rupee had gained as much as 0.2 percent earlier after
Chidambaram said in Pune that he’s “optimistic” the fiscal
shortfall will amount to 5.3 percent of gross domestic product
for the year through March, compared with 5.8 percent last year.
U.S. consumers spent 13 percent more during the Thanksgiving
weekend than a year earlier, the  National Retail Federation  said
yesterday.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 56.42 per dollar,
compared with 56.40 on Nov. 23, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were at 56.53
versus 56.48. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
