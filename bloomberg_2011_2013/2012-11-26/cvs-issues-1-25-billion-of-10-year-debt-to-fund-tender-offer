CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) , the largest
provider of  prescription drugs  in the U.S., sold $1.25 billion
of 10-year bonds to repurchase outstanding debt.  CVS issued 2.75 percent notes maturing in 2022 to yield 110
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  pharmacy services firm  announced a tender offer today
for any and all of its $1 billion of 6.6 percent debt maturing
in March 2019, and as much as $1 billion of its $2.45 billion of
bonds maturing in 2016 and 2017, less the aggregate principal
amount of 2019 notes tendered and accepted for purchase,
according to a statement distributed by PR Newswire.  The pharmacyâ€™s $700 million of 6.125 percent debt maturing
in 2016 traded at 118.4 cents on the dollar to yield 1.07
percent on Nov. 23, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Barclays Plc and Wells Fargo & Co. managed the sale of the
new bonds for the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
