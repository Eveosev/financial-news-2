Dollar General Corp. (DG)  will replace
 Cooper Industries  Plc in the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index,
according to a statement from the index provider.  Dollar General, the largest U.S. dollar-store chain, will
be added to the U.S. equity benchmark after the close of trading
on Nov. 30, the statement said. Cooper Industries, a maker of
electric-distribution equipment, is being purchased by  Eaton
Corp. (ETN)  in a deal that may be completed around that time, S&P
said.  The revisions in the S&P 500 may prompt money managers that
track the index to shift holdings to match the adjustments.  Dollar General shares rose 3.4 percent to $51 as of 5:36
p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
