Former San Francisco Giants
outfielder Melky Cabrera will receive a full postseason share of
$377,003 after the World Series-winning team opted not to use
him in the playoffs following a 50-game drug ban.  The Giants, who swept the  Detroit Tigers  in four games last
month to win their second  World Series  in three years, awarded
50 full shares out of a $23.5 million players’ pool, 11.1
partial shares and 12 cash awards,  Major League Baseball  said in
a statement. The $377,003 payout was a record. Full shares paid
to Tigers’ players were worth $284,275.  Cabrera was an All-Star who was batting .346 when he was
banned for 50 games on Aug. 15 after testing positive for
testosterone. He was reinstated to the Giants’ 40-man roster on
Oct. 12, though the team chose not to include him on their
active lists for the National League Championship Series, which
began Oct. 14, and the World Series.  Under baseball’s Rule 45 on eligibility, Cabrera was
automatically awarded a full share because he was on the roster
after June 1 and eligible to participate in the World Series.  Cabrera signed a two-year contract with the  Toronto Blue
Jays  this month. The deal is worth $16 million, according to the
 New York  Post.  The postseason players’ pool, which went to 10 teams, was
$65,363,469, derived from 50 percent of gate receipts from wild-
card games and 60 percent of gate receipts from the other series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
