Thailand’s baht rose, touching the
strongest level in almost two weeks, as a government report
today showed exports climbed last month by the most in more than
a year.  Government bonds  were little changed.  Overseas sales , which account for about two-thirds of
Southeast  Asia ’s second-largest economy, jumped 16 percent in
October after rising 0.2 percent the previous month, official
data showed. Global funds purchased $386 million more Thai
equities than they sold last week, exchange data show. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index rose for a fourth day.  “Risk sentiment has been stabilizing recently and so funds
are flowing into Asia, supporting regional currencies,” said
 Tsutomu Soma , manager of the investment trust and fixed-income
business unit at Rakuten Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “Gains in
stocks are also helping to boost investor appetite for emerging-
market assets.”  The baht advanced 0.1 percent to 30.67 per dollar as of
3:16 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 30.62 earlier, the strongest level since Nov. 13.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, rose three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.3 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 was
little changed at 3.01 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
