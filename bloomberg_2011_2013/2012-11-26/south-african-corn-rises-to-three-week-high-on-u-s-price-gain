South African corn rose to the
highest in three weeks following a second day of increases in
the price of the grain in the U.S., the biggest producer.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, increased 0.4 percent to 2,490 rand ($281) a metric
ton, the highest since Nov. 5, by the close in Johannesburg.
Contracts on the grain for July delivery rallied 2.9 percent,
the most since Oct. 4 to 2,450 rand a ton. The yellow variety
gained 0.4 percent to 2,550 rand a ton.  Corn on the Chicago Board of Trade climbed as much as 1
percent to $7.57 a bushel today, the highest since Oct. 31  “The Chicago prices went up a few cents and that is why
our prices look like this,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg. Longer-dated
contracts climbed “due to the lack of rain in the main growing
regions of the North West,” he said. “The rain we are
experiencing now is below average and we need at least 50
milliliters (2 inches) just to get going and so far, that hasn’t
come.”  No rain has been forecast for Delareyville, one of the main
growing areas in South Africa’s North West province, until Nov.
30, the  South African Weather Service  said on its website.  The nation is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from the white variety is used as one of the country’s
staple foods, while yellow corn is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in March declined 0.3 percent to 3,778
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
