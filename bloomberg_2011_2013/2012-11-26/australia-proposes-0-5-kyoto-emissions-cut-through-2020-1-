Australia  proposed to cut its
emissions by 0.5 percent compared with 1990 levels in the eight
years through 2020 as it seeks to join extended targets under
the Kyoto Protocol.  The nation’s target was contingent on continued progress of
international negotiations toward “serious commitments” from
developed and  developing countries  under a global climate
protection deal in 2015, according to a  statement  on the website
of United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change .  Australia’s proposed cut is  less ambitious than the
minimum 20 percent reduction planned by the European Union and
at least 40 percent sought for richer nations by some developing
countries including China and  India . Nations are meeting in Doha
for two weeks from today to continue negotiations over a global
climate treaty that would take effect from 2020. Developed
countries in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol must cut their greenhouse-
gas discharges by an average of about 5 percent from 1990 levels
over the period from 2008 through 2012.  “Australia’s announcement today to reduce 0.5 percent
since 1990 under obligations of the  Kyoto Protocol  is not
acceptable,” said Martin Kaiser, head of international climate
politics for Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group. “We
call on them to go up to a 25 percent reduction target,” he
said today at a news briefing at climate talks in Doha, Qatar.  Australia’s net cumulative emissions from 2013 to 2020 are
now projected to be around 14 percent, or 750 million metric
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, lower than they would have
been without its carbon price and its Carbon Farming Initiative
program, according to the nation’s statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
