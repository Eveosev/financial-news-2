South Korean rapper Psy’s “Gangnam Style” has become the most-viewed video on Google Inc.’s YouTube website, surpassing Justin Bieber’s “Baby.”  The video, which contains satirical lyrics about the habits of wealthy South Koreans and features choreography mimicking horse riding, reached 805 million views on Nov. 24, while “Baby” had 803 million views, YouTube said in a posting on its Trends  blog . The video is watched between 7 and 10 million times a day, the blog said. The hits have now increased to 824 million.  The popularity of the video has vaulted 34-year-old musician Park Jae Sang into fame under the pseudonym Psy, earning the rapper appearances on U.S. television programs including “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and NBC’s “Today Show.”  The West China Metropolis Daily newspaper reported last week that Psy was in talks to appear on state-broadcaster  China Central Television ’s Spring Festival gala, a variety show broadcast annually on Chinese Lunar New Year eve that is the nation’s most-watched program.  YG Entertainment Inc. (122870) , which manages Psy, today retreated 2.4 percent to 57,000 won, while the Kosdaq Index, where the company is listed, lost 0.5 percent.
