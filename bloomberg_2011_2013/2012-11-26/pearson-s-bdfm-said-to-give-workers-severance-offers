BDFM Publishers (Pty) Ltd., a South
African joint venture between  Pearson Plc (PSON)  and  Times Media Group
Ltd. (TMG) , issued letters offering employees of Business Day and
Financial Mail voluntary severance, according to four people who
saw the documents.  The Johannesburg-based company had already told employees
that bonuses will not be paid this year, the people said,
declining to be identified because a public announcement has not
been made.  Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. in August bought all of the shares
it didn’t already own in Times Media, then known as Avusa Ltd.  Details of the offer weren’t given in the letters, which
were sent to all employees, the people said.  Business Day is  South Africa ’s biggest daily business paper
and Financial Mail is the country’s biggest financial weekly.
BDFM also owns Summit television station.  Calls made by Bloomberg to the mobile phone of Peter Bruce,
appointed as publisher of BDFM in August, weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
