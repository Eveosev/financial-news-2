The rand gained for a third day as
foreign investors bought the most South African bonds in seven
weeks and euro-area finance ministers met to discuss an aid
payment to  Greece .  South Africa’s currency advanced as much as 0.3 percent and
traded 0.2 percent stronger at 8.8582 per dollar as of 3:51 p.m.
in Johannesburg, after declining less than 0.1 percent last
week. Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026
fell two basis points to 7.62 percent.  Finance chiefs will brief the European Central Bank and
International Monetary Fund on “further concessions” that
would plug Greece’s deficit gap without forcing a writeoff of
official loans,  Austria ’s Maria Fekter said before the latest
round of talks on the country’s debt crisis. The euro area
accounted for 22 percent of South Africa’s exports last year.
Foreign investors  bought  a net 5.72 billion rand ($645 million)
of the country’s bonds last week, the most since the period
ended Oct. 5, according to data supplied by JSE Ltd.  “Bond buying has been the real driver and flows are still
trickling in,” Ockert van Niekerk, a currency trader at PSG
Online, said by phone from Cape Town. “We also have producer
inflation data out later this week and guys still want to see
what the full outcome on the Greek talks will be.”  Producer prices probably rose 4.7 percent last month from
4.2 percent in September, according to the median estimate of
nine economists polled by Bloomberg. The data is due for release
on Nov. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
