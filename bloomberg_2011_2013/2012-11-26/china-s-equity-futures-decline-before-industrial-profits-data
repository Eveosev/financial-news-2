China’s stocks  declined, with the
benchmark index approaching the 2,000 level, before the release
of industrial profits data tomorrow.  Liquor maker  JiuGuiJiu Co. (000799)  plunged by the 10 percent daily
limit for a second straight day after its products were found to
have excessive levels of plasticizer. Datong Coal Industry Co.,
the nation’s third-largest producer of the fuel, fell to the
lowest since March 2009 on lower thermal-coal prices.  Chongqing
Iron & Steel Co. (601005)  surged by the 10 percent daily limit after the
local regulator approved its asset-purchase plan.  “The 2,000 level is a psychologically important gateway
for investors,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at
Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “Once it’s
approached, some money will buy on dips on expectations about
possible government support. But there’s no big room for the
index to go up either as there’s a lack of positive
macroeconomic news.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.5 percent to 2,017.46
at the close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  sank 0.8 percent to 2,175.60.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  lost 0.2 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, added 2.3 percent on Nov. 23.  The Shanghai Composite advanced 0.6 percent last week, the
first gain in three weeks. It dropped below 2,000 during
intraday trading twice last week and rallied to close above that
level amid speculation of government support. The gauge has
slumped 8.3 percent this year and trades at 9.6 times estimated
profit for 2012, compared with the 17.7 average multiple since
Bloomberg began compiling the  data  in 2006.  Economic Target  The statistics bureau is due to release industrial
companies’ profits for October tomorrow. The profits rose 7.8
percent from a year earlier in September, the first increase in
six months.  The annual central economic work meeting, which may be held
next week in Beijing, may set 2013 gross domestic product growth
target at 7.5 percent, the same as this year, the China Business
News reported today, citing an unidentified person.  A  measure  of consumer staples stocks in the CSI 300 lost
1.7 percent, the second-biggest decline among the 10 industrial
groups. JiuGuiJiu tumbled 10 percent to 38.54  yuan . The spirit
maker apologized last week to consumers and investors in a stock
exchange filing and said it is co-operating with requests from
the provincial quality watchdog to run strict checks on its
distribution and packaging processes.  Stock Volatility  Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s biggest producer of baijiu
liquor by market value, slid 2.3 percent to 217.05 yuan.
 Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858) , the second largest, lost 2.3 percent to
27.08 yuan.  Datong Coal retreated 1.3 percent to 8.50 yuan. Shanxi
Lu’an Environmental Energy Development Co. sank 2.2 percent to
16.30 yuan.  Pingdingshan Tianan Coal Mining Co. (601666)  fell 1.6 percent
to 7.81 yuan.  China’s benchmark price for coal used in power stations
fell to a range of 630 yuan to 640 yuan a metric ton as of
yesterday, the lowest since Oct. 7, according to data today from
the  China  Coal Transport and Distribution Association.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 27 percent
lower than the 30-day average today, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Thirty-day  volatility  in gauge was at 13.2,
compared with this year’s average of 17.  Asset Purchase  Chongqing Steel surged by the 10 percent daily limit to
2.61 yuan after the company said its plan to purchase assets
from the parent was approved by Chongqing’s regulator of state-
owned assets. The steelmaker said last month it plans to buy
coking, iron-making assets and supporting facilities worth 16.9
billion yuan ($2.71 billion) from its parent.  China’s wage gains have moderated on weaker corporate
profits, capping consumer demand as the government seeks to
sustain a rebound after a seven-quarter economic slowdown.  Average urban salaries rose 12 percent in the first nine
months from a year earlier without adjusting for inflation,
slowing from 14.4 percent for all of 2011 and 13.3 percent in
2010, government data show.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., jumped 2.4 percent to $37.46
on Nov. 23, the highest close since Nov. 6. The ETF gained 4.7
percent last week, the most since June.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
