The 23-year-old daughter of Houston
Rockets coach Kevin McHale died after a lengthy battle with the
autoimmune disease lupus and team owner Leslie Alexander said
the entire organization is in mourning.  Sasha McHale had been hospitalized since Nov. 10, the day
McHale took a leave of absence from the National Basketball
Association team, the  Houston Chronicle reported . She died two
days ago in  Minneapolis .  “I extend my deepest condolences to Kevin and Lynn for the
loss of their beautiful daughter, Sasha,” Alexander said
yesterday in a statement. “Our entire organization is mourning
the McHale family’s loss and we ask that you keep them in your
thoughts and prayers.”  Kelvin Sampson has been serving as the Rockets’ interim
coach for the past several weeks and relayed the news of Sasha
McHale’s death to the players before yesterday’s practice, the
Houston Chronicle said on its website.  “Sasha was a daddy’s girl,” Sampson was quoted as saying
by the paper. “I remember last year during the lockout when we
were meeting, she got sick. She was on a study abroad and had to
come back. He just talked about her all the time. It’s just
tough. It’s terrible.”  Sasha McHale was one of McHale’s five children and the
youngest of his two daughters, the Chronicle said. Funeral
arrangements are pending, the paper said, and plans are in place
for the Rockets to travel to Minneapolis from Oklahoma City
after their Nov. 28 game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
