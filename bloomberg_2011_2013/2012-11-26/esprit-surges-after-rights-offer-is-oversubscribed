Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330)  climbed in  Hong
Kong  trading after the apparel retailer said its rights offer of
shares was about seven times oversubscribed.  The clothier  jumped  as much as 10 percent before closing
2.8 percent higher at HK$12.58. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index 
dropped 0.2 percent.  Esprit in October said it planned to raise as much as
HK$5.2 billion ($671 million) in a rights offer to fund efforts
to revive its brand after posting a slump in first quarter
sales. The  Hong Kong-based company received applications that
represented 7.7 times the rights shares available for
subscription, according to a Nov. 23 statement.  “The oversubscription is definitely positive for the
stock,” said Steven Leung, a Hong Kong-based institutional
sales director at UOB Kay Hian Ltd.  Esprit last week confirmed that former chairman Michael Ying has increased his  stake  to 10.34 percent from 8.99 percent.  Ying’s move may give investors “some hopes that he would
take more control of the company and direct the company to the
right track,” UOB’s Leung said. Esprit has missed estimates in
the last five years as competitors such as  Inditex SA (ITX) ’s Zara
have drawn customers away.  To contact the reporter on this story:
