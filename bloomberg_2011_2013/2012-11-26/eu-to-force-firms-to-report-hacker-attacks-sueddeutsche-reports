The European Union plans to oblige
companies to report if they have become the target of computer
hackers,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing Neelie Kroes, the
region’s commissioner for the digital agenda.  Kroes, Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem and
foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton plan to reveal a strategy
for European cyber security before the end of the year, the
newspaper said. Kroes’ department then plans to draft rules for
Internet providers and server operators, according to
Sueddeutsche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
