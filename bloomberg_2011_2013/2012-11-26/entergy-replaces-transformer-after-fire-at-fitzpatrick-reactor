Entergy Corp. (ETR)  replaced a damaged
transformer at the 852-megawatt Fitzpatrick 1 reactor in  New
York  after a failure that caused a fire and shut down the plant
Nov. 11.  The reactor connected to the grid yesterday and operated at
38 percent of power early today after crews installed a spare
transformer that was on site, said Tammy Holden, a company
spokeswoman.  An investigation into the cause of the equipment failure is
under way, said Holden.  “Preliminary results suggest the fire was caused by an
internal fault,” Holden, who is based at the plant, said in an
e-mail responding to questions. “The failed equipment will be
disassembled and a complete investigation conducted to identify
the origin of the fault.”  The reactor, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) northeast of
Oswego, has experienced two automatic  production  halts this
month. Fitzpatrick 1 shut once when a main turbine tripped and
again after the equipment malfunction.  The transformer that failed is one of two that take
electrical power produced by the plant’s generator, step up the
voltage and then send it out to the grid, said  Neil Sheehan , the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s spokesman for the Northeast
region.  If a reactor experiences three such halts in a period of
7,000 operating hours, the commission is required to heighten
the level of oversight at the unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
