Dubai’s economy is headed for the
biggest expansion in five years as the Persian Gulf business hub
benefits from tourism and trade.  The emirate’s gross domestic product grew 4.1 percent in
the first half to 161.5 billion dirhams ($44 billion), the Dubai
Statistics Center said in an e-mailed statement today, on track
to reach the government’s forecast of 5 percent for the year.
The hotel and restaurant industries grew more than 16 percent,
while manufacturing expanded 10.4 percent. The emirate’s economy
grew 18.1 percent in 2007, according to government data.  “We have seen a continued improvement in consumption
environment, both linked to domestic consumption and tourism,”
 Monica Malik , Dubai-based chief economist at EFG-Hermes who
forecasts 2012 GDP growth at 4 percent, said by telephone.
“Moreover, we are seeing signs of a tentative pickup in
investments, which is a relatively newer development.”  Dubai’s ruler on Nov. 24 announced plans for a development
boasting the world’s biggest shopping mall and gardens larger
than  London ’s Hyde Park, as the emirate revives property
projects on hold since the start of the global financial crisis.
The Dubai Financial Market General Index has climbed  17 percent 
this year and is headed for the biggest gain since 2007.  Property Slump  The sheikhdom, the second-biggest in the  United Arab
Emirates  after  Abu Dhabi , saw its economy collapse after the
crisis tightened credit, causing property prices to plummet.
Real-estate and business services grew 1.5 percent in the first
half of this year.  Dubai racked up $113 billion of debt transforming itself
into a tourism and commercial hub, according to the
 International Monetary Fund . The emirate has $9.8 billion of
debt maturing next year and $32 billion in 2014, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said last year. Its economy contracted 2.4 percent
in 2009, the year it almost defaulted on debt, before expanding
2.8 percent in 2010 and 3.4 percent the following year.  “The current facilities available in Dubai need to be
scaled up in line with the future ambitions for the city,”
Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum said in a statement on
Nov. 24. “We have to start work immediately” on the project.  Investment Pickup  A construction boom in the emirate, which opened its
 property market  to foreign buyers in 2002, led to several large
projects including the world’s tallest tower and man-made
islands off the coast. Work on two of three palm-shaped
residential islands was interrupted as the bonanza turned to
bust in the third quarter of 2008.  “The improvement in the fiscal position and access to
external funding has been vital for supporting the investment
activity,” Malik said. “Moreover, the pickup in  house prices 
is supporting some real-estate developments that were earlier
stalled.”  Dubai sold $1.25 billion of Islamic dollar bonds in April,
its first debt offering in almost a year. The yield on its 4.9
percent sukuk due May 2017 has fallen 146 basis points to 3.38
percent since it began trading. The average cost of a mid-range
villa in Dubai last month rose to the highest since January
2009, according to data compiled by Cluttons LLC.  The cost of insuring Dubai’s debt against default has
declined 202 basis points this year to 238 on Nov. 23, according
to data provider CMA. That’s 739 basis points less than its peak
in February 2009, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
