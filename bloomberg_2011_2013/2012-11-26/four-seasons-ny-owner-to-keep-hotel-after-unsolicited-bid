Four Seasons Hotel New York  owner H. Ty Warner decided not to sell the luxury Manhattan property
after receiving an unsolicited bid of about $900 million.  “Due to the continued strength in the  New York  real estate
market and impending fiscal cliff, he does not feel that this is
an advantageous time to sell this iconic property,” Donna
Snopek, chief financial officer of Ty Warner Hotels and Resorts
LLC, said today in an e-mailed statement. The fiscal cliff
refers to federal spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to
take effect if Congress doesn’t act by the end of the year.  Warner, the Beanie Babies creator, received the offer from
an unidentified Asian buyer, a person close to the situation
said three weeks ago. Warner bought the 368-room hotel, located
on East 57th Street in Midtown, for $275 million in 1999.  A deal for $900 million would have been one of the priciest
in Manhattan. A recent hotel transaction in the area was
 Strategic Hotels & Resorts Inc.’s (BEE)  September purchase of the
luxury Essex House, on Central Park South, for $362.3 million.  Rates at the Four Seasons for this week start at $995 a
night, according to the hotel’s  website .  Warner , through his Ty Warner Hotels and Resorts, also owns
the San Ysidro Ranch in  Santa Barbara ,  California , and Las
Ventanas al Paraiso in Los Cabos,  Mexico , according to the
company’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
