  DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA)  fell
the most in almost four months after Caris & Co. downgraded the
stock over “shockingly low” returns from the studio’s latest
film, “Rise of The Guardians.”  The shares tumbled 5.2 percent to $17.11 at the close in
New York, the steepest one-day drop since Aug. 1. The stock,
which declined for the third-straight day, has gained 3.1
percent this year.  “Guardians” collected $32.6 million in U.S. and Canadian
theaters over the extended five-day Thanksgiving weekend,
according to Hollywood.com Box-Office, coming in fourth place in
its debut. David Miller, a Caris analyst, said the total could
force Glendale, California-based DreamWorks Animation to write
down its investment in the movie.  Miller downgraded the stock to a below-average rating, the
equivalent of sell, from a neutral rating. He also cut his 2013
earnings estimate for the company to 90 cents from $1.15 a share
and his price target for the stock to $15 from $20.  “Guardians” ranked behind “The Twilight Saga: Breaking
Dawn - Part 2,” “Skyfall” and “Lincoln.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
