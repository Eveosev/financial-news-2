EBay Inc. (EBAY)  rose 4.9 percent to an
almost eight-year high on optimism that it will benefit from a
surge in online shopping ahead of the year-end holidays.  Shares of EBay, the biggest online marketplace, rose to
$51.40 in New York, the highest closing price since Jan. 19,
2005.  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the largest Internet retailer, gained 1.6
percent to $243.62.  Consumers seeking to save time and money by doing their
gift-buying over the Web are flocking to EBay on so-called Cyber
Monday, when many retailers mark down items sold online. Sales
volume for San Jose, California-based EBay was up 57 percent as
of early today, a fivefold increase from last year, according to
ChannelAdvisor, which tracks online commerce.  “EBay is definitely participating in holiday 2012 in a
much different and larger way than last year,” Scot Wingo,
ChannelAdvisor’s chief executive officer, wrote in a blog post
today.  EBay and Amazon both have recorded  strong sales gains  each
day starting with Thanksgiving, ChannelAdvisor said.
Transactions on mobile devices have accounted for more than 30
percent of the total each day, the Morrisville, North Carolina-
based tracking company said.  Victor Anthony, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets Inc.,
and Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co., released
positive research notes based on online sales data from
ChannelAdvisor and  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   EBay is an investor in ChannelAdvisor, according to the
company’s blog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
