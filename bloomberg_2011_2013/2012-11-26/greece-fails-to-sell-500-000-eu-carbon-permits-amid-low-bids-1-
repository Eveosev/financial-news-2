Greece  failed to sell 500,000 spot
European Union carbon permits in an auction on Hellenic
Exchanges SA’s Athens exchange, according to the bourse.  The sale could not be completed as bids failed to match the
Greek government’s minimum sales price of 6.75 euros ($8.75) a
metric ton at the close of the bidding period, Alexandra
Grispou, a spokeswoman for the Athens Exchange, said today in an
e-mailed response to questions.  Four buyers participated in the sale, with the highest bid
at 6.69 euros a ton, Grispou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
