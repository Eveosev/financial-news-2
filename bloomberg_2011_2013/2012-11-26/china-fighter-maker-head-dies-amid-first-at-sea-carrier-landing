Luo Yang, who headed  China ’s
fighter-jet building program as chairman and president of
 Shenyang Aircraft Corp. , died yesterday during landing tests for
the nation’s first aircraft carrier.  Luo, 51, had a heart attack while helping oversee the
tests, Shenyang Aircraft’s parent, state-controlled Aviation
Industry Corp. of China, said today in an e-mailed statement.  A J-15 fighter, built by Shenyang Aircraft, successfully
landed on the carrier Liaoning over the weekend, the first time
a Chinese aircraft has landed at sea, according to the official
Xinhua News Agency. The Liaoning, named after a Chinese
province, was commissioned in September.  The landing marked the debut of the J-15 as the nation’s
first generation multipurpose carrier-borne fighter jet, Xinhua
said. Shenyang Aircraft, dubbed the “cradle of China’s fighter
aircraft,” has built several thousand fighter jets over past 50
years, according to its website.  The company, based in northeastern China’s Shenyang city,
also builds the  162 SkyCatcher  light sport aircraft with Cessna
Aircraft Co. It makes parts for Commercial Aircraft Corp. of
China Ltd., Airbus SAS,  Boeing Co. (BA)  and  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)   Luo, a Shenyang native, devoted more than three decades to
developing Chinese aviation, according to the statement. He held
a master’s degree in aircraft design from Beihang University,
previously known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and
Astronautics, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
