Vietnam ’s three-year government
bonds fell for the first time in three weeks on speculation
accelerating inflation makes it less likely the central bank
will resume cutting  interest rates  to spur growth. The dong fell.  Consumer prices  gained 7.08 percent in November from a year
earlier, the most since May, official data showed Nov. 24.
Vietnam will cut interest rates next year in line with inflation,
Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said Nov. 14. The government
estimates the economy will  expand   by 5.2 percent this year, the
slowest pace since 1999.  “Prudent policy should keep the economic environment
stable,” Matt Hildebrandt, a Singapore-based economist at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a research note today. “This
suggests that additional policy-rate cuts are unlikely and that
monetary policy will remain modestly tight.”  The central bank has cut its refinancing rate by five
percentage points this year to 10 percent, with the most recent
reduction on July 1.  The yield on the three-year bonds rose three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.43 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the first
increase since Nov. 1.  The dong fell 0.1 percent to 20,865 per dollar as of 2:27
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
