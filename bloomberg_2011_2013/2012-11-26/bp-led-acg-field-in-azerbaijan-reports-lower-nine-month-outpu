BP Plc (BP/) , which drew criticism from
the Azeri president for failing to stem a decline in output from
the country’s biggest oilfield, said production at Azeri-Chirag-
Guneshli fell in the first nine months of the year.  The field, also known as ACG, produced 25.3 million metric
tons, or an average of 684,000 barrels a day. That represented a
drop of 9.3 percent from a year earlier, BP’s office in the
Azeri capital of Baku said by e-mail today. It gave no reason
for the decline.  President  Ilham Aliyev  last month blamed “grave mistakes”
by BP for the “unexpected” decline at ACG, which accounted for
78 percent of the nation’s total output last year. BP has since
replaced regional executives and promised to bring in its best
experts from around the world to address the “technical
challenges” presented by the field.  Output from the Caspian natural-gas field of Shah Deniz,
also led by BP, grew 15 percent to 5.2 billion cubic meters, the
company said.  Azerbaijan , the largest oil producer in the former  Soviet
Union  after Russia and  Kazakhstan , saw its total crude
production fall 7.8 percent to 32.7 million tons in the first
nine months. Gas output climbed 0.4 percent to 6.5 billion cubic
meters in the third quarter from a year earlier, State Oil Co.
of Azerbaijan said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
