Alliant Insurance Services Inc., the
specialty insurance brokerage firm being acquired by KKR & Co.,
is seeking a $680 million  term loan  to back the purchase,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is arranging the financing for the
Newport Beach, California-based company, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the information is private.
The bank will meet with lenders Nov. 28 at 11 a.m. in New York
to discuss the deal, the person said.  KKR is acquiring Alliant for an undisclosed amount from
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  which purchased the company in 2007,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The transaction is
expected to be completed before year-end, according to a Nov. 23
company statement.  The management team and employees of Alliant own about 45
percent of the company and will roll over a substantial portion
of their investment in the company, according to the statement.  Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for KKR, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
