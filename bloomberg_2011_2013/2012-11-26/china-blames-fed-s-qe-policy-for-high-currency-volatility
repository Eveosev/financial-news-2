China says the U.S. program of
asset-purchases known as quantitative easing is increasing the
volatility of emerging-market currencies.  The Asian nation and many others have criticized “this
irresponsible and beggar-thy-neighbor policy” because it has a
“lingering negative impact on developing, emerging economies in
particular,” Zhu Hong, China’s deputy permanent representative
to the  World Trade Organization , said in meeting today in
Geneva, according to a statement issued afterward.  The U.S. Federal Reserve said in September it would buy $40
billion of mortgage-backed debt each month in a third round of
its stimulus program intended to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs to help foster growth. The U.K. and  Japan  have
also undertaken QE since the start of the global financial
crisis in 2007.  Currency volatility was a result of “the quantitative-
easing monetary policy pursued by some government whose currency
serves as the major currency for international payment, and in
the unfair international monetary and financial system,” Zhu
said, according to the statement. “The right path to resolve
this issue is by enhancing the responsibility of and promoting
coordination among the international reserve-currency issuers.”  The WTO meeting today was proposed by  Brazil  on the
relationship between currencies and global trade. The
 International Monetary Fund , and not the Geneva-based WTO, was
the proper forum to discuss exchange rates, Zhu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
