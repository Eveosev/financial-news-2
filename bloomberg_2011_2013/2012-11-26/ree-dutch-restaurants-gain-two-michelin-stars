Michelin today awarded two stars to
three more restaurants in the Netherlands, including two in
Amsterdam, taking the total 18, a record for the country. 
Another four establishments gained a single star.  “This record confirms the vitality and quality of gourmet
cooking in the Netherlands, led by very good chefs, most of whom
are young and fully capable of reshaping the country’s fine
dining scene,” Michelin said in an e-mailed release.  The winners are  Aan de Poel , situated next to a lake in
Amstelveen, Amsterdam;  &Samhoud Places , also in Amsterdam; and
 De Treeswijkhoeve , a contemporary venue in Waalre.  Bord’Eau , in
Amsterdam, was among those awarded a single star.  The Netherlands has two restaurants with three stars, 18
with two and 81 with one. Three stars mean exceptional cuisine,
worth a special journey; two are for excellent cooking, worth a
detour; one denotes a very good restaurant in its category.  Michelin & Cie (ML) , the world’s second-biggest tiremaker,
produced its first guide in 1900. It was free of charge until
1920 and intended for chauffeurs. The volume contained practical
information, including street maps and tips on repairing tires.
The company is based in Clermont-Ferrand,  France .  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
