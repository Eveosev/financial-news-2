Former Bank of England policy maker
 David Blanchflower  said  Mark Carney  is the “best available”
leader for the U.K. central bank and probably will shake up the
318-year-old institution when he takes over.  Carney’s experience as Bank of Canada Governor, a former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing director and his doctorate in
economics from Oxford University make him “a great
appointment,” Blanchflower said today on Bloomberg Radio’s
“The Hays Advantage” with Kathleen Hays and Vonnie Quinn.  Carney, 47, will become the first foreigner to run the
central bank as it absorbs new powers as a banking regulator.
He’ll replace  Mervyn King  from July as policy makers pursue
record-low interest rates and asset-buying to propel the economy
from its first double-dip recession since the 1970s.  “This guy is head and shoulders above the other
candidates,” said Blanchflower, an economics professor at
Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, and Bloomberg
Television contributing editor.  “The great thing about him is he’s going to come in with a
big broom and sweep clean the Bank of England, which is what’s
needed” because the central bank didn’t foresee the recession
last decade and still faces an economy that’s “in the
doldrums.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
