Turkey ’s bond  yields  dropped to a
record as investors bet a cut in  interest rates  expected next
month will mark the beginning of a series aimed at stimulating
the nation’s slowing economy.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt slid 8 basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 6.12 percent, the lowest level since
at least 2005. The lira depreciated as much as 0.4 percent
before paring its loss to less than 0.1 percent at 1.7939 per
dollar by 6:16 p.m. in Istanbul.  Turkey’s benchmark yields have slumped 489 basis points
this year. The nation’s confidence index for manufacturers fell
to 101 in November, the lowest in 2012, the central bank said
today. Capacity utilisation for the same month also declined to
74 percent from 74.9 percent in October, the bank said.  “The market is clearly pricing in a rate cut cycle,” Isik Okte, an Istanbul-based strategist at Halk Invest, said in e-
mailed comments today. “We expect a 25 basis-point cut in
December, and the  bond market  at these prices has already priced
in most of the cut this time, but people are still not taking
profits. Once these cuts to the benchmark rate start, they will
not end at 25 basis points.”  Lira bonds have rallied 96 basis points this month as  Fitch
Ratings  upgraded Turkey to investment grade on Nov. 5 and
central bank Governor Erdem Basci said on Nov. 12 he won’t
tolerate any unwarranted currency gain jeopardizing the
country’s external balances. He said the central bank will act
if an inflation-adjusted measure of lira’s strength showed the
currency appreciating to overvalued territory.  Turkey’s economic growth fell to 2.9 percent in the second
quarter from 9.1 percent a year earlier.  “This is a clear indication of belief that upcoming
central bank rate cuts will last a cycle, and it will not be a
one-shot-and-done deal,” Halk Invest’s Okte said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
