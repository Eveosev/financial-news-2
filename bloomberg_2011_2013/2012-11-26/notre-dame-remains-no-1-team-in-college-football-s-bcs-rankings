The University of  Notre Dame  remains
the No. 1 school in college football’s Bowl Championship Series
rankings, ensuring the unbeaten Fighting Irish will play for the
national title.  Notre Dame finished a 12-0 regular season with last night’s
22-13 victory at the University of  Southern California .  The University of Alabama (11-1) and University of Georgia
(11-1) are ranked second and third in the BCS rankings ahead of
their Dec. 1 meeting in the Southeastern Conference championship
game in Atlanta. The winner will probably claim the No. 2 spot
in the final rankings and face Notre Dame in the Jan. 7 BCS
title game in Miami.  The University of Florida (11-1) is fourth in the BCS
standings, followed by Oregon (11-1), Kansas State (10-1),
Louisiana State (10-2), Stanford (10-2),  Texas  A&M (10-2) and
South Carolina  (10-2).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
