Nintendo Co. has sold more than 1.2
million game consoles in the U.S. since Nov. 18, including
400,000 of its new Wii U with a touch-screen GamePad, the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  The first major console since 2006 was mostly sold out just
days after it went on sale and new stocks were expected in
stores in time for the Black Friday official start of the U.S.
holiday shopping period,  Reggie Fils-Aime , president of Nintendo
of America, said last week.  The high-definition console is offered in two versions
costing about $300 and $350 with a 6.2-inch (16 centimeters)
touch screen controller called the GamePad.  Nintendo, based in Kyoto,  Japan  also sold more than 300,000
units of the older Wii motion-sensing console and about 275,000
Nintendo DS handheld units from Nov. 18 through Nov. 24,
according to the statement.  The company introduced the Wii U in the U.S. weeks before
Europe and Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
