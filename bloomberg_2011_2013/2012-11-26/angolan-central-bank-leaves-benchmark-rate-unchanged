The central bank of Angola, Africaâ€™s
biggest oil producer after  Nigeria , kept its benchmark  interest
rate  unchanged for a 10th consecutive month.  The key lending rate was left at 10.25 percent, the Luanda-
based Banco Nacional de Angola said in an e-mailed statement
today. The bank has cut the rate once since introducing it in
October 2011, lowering it by a quarter of a percentage point in
January.  Inflation rose to 9.8 percent in October from 9.7 percent a
month earlier, the statistics office said on Nov. 13. Inflation
fell from 11.5 percent in January as the southwest African
country targets a rate of less than 10 percent this year.  The MPC was created to help improve financial management
after the country secured a loan from the  International Monetary
Fund  in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
