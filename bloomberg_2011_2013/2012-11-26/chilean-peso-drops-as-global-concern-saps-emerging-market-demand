Chile’s peso fell for a second day
as global stocks dropped on  U.S. debt  wrangling and  Greece ’s
debt turmoil, sapping demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 481.62 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close in Santiago. Copper for March delivery
dropped as much as 0.6 percent before erasing its decline.  The peso slid as U.S. politicians prepared for talks to
avoid $607 billion of automatic tax increases and spending cuts
set to take effect next year. Euro-area finance ministers are
meeting today in Brussels to negotiate a bailout payment for
Greece. The  dollar  rose as much as 0.2 percent against the
currencies of major U.S. trading partners as investors sought
refuge.  “Markets are negative because of Greece and the U.S.
budget,” said Ronald Volpi, the head of spot currency trading
at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “We’re
seeing buying of dollars.”  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
trimmed their bets against the currency to $7.1 billion on Nov.
22, the lowest  since May , according to data published today by
the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
