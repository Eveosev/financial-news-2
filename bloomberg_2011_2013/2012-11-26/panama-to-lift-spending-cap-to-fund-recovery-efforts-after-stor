Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli said he’ll seek to temporarily suspend a budget
spending cap after heavy rains damaged parts of the Central
American nation and prompted the government to declare a state
of emergency.  Lawmakers will meet Nov. 28 to debate the measure after
more than 1,000 homes and five bridges were damaged along the
country’s Caribbean coast, according to an e-mailed statement
from the president’s office today.  The government must run a budget deficit no greater than
2.8 percent of gross domestic product, though spending can be
increased during national emergencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
