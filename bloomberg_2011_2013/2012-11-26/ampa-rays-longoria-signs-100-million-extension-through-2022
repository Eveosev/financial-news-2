Tampa Bay Rays third baseman Evan Longoria signed a six-year, $100 million contract extension that
runs through the 2022 Major League Baseball season.  The deal for the three-time All-Star, which also includes a
club option for 2023, incorporates salaries negotiated in his
previous contract for 2013-16, the Rays said on their website.  Longoria, 27, was scheduled to make $6 million in 2013 and
the team had club options to pay him $7.5 million in 2014, $11
million in 2015 and $11.5 million in 2016, according to  Baseball
Prospectus . That makes the value of the new contract $136
million over 10 years. He made $8.5 million in total salary from
2008 to 2012.  “Evan has all of the attributes we seek in a player,”
Andrew Friedman, the Rays’ executive vice president of baseball
operations, said in a statement. “His determination and work
ethic inspire others around him.”  Longoria, the American League Rookie of the Year in 2008,
was limited to 74 games last season after partially tearing his
left hamstring on April 30. He hit .289 with 17 home runs and 55
runs batted in as the Rays finished 90-72 to miss the
postseason.  For his career, Longoria has a .276 batting average with
130 homers and 456 RBI, twice winning a Gold Glove for his
fielding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
