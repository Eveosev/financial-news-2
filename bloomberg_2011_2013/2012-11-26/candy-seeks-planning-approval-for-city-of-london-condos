CPC Group, the developer owned by
 Christian Candy , asked for planning permission to build 165
apartments near the Tower of  London .  CPC bought the Sugar Quay site in the City of London
financial district in February and is seeking to develop an 11-
story building with apartments and a shop on the bank of the
 River Thames  near Tower Bridge, the closely-held company said
today in a statement.  Developers are turning obsolete commercial buildings into
apartments in the City of London as non-prime offices on the
fringes of the financial district become difficult to lease.
Architects Foster + Partners have been working with CPC on the
development proposal, according to the statement. The site
already had planning permission for an office building when it
was bought by Guernsey, Channel Islands-based CPC, according to
the company’s website.  CPC plans to improve “the vitality and character of the
area whilst delivering an exceptional living experience in a
prominent location in the  City of London ,” it said in the e-
mailed statement.  CPC developed the luxury One Hyde Park apartment project in
Knightsbridge as part of a joint venture with Qatar Prime
Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jaber al Thani’s closely
held Waterknights.  To contact the reporters on this story:
