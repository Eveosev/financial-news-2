The U.S.  Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service  said it’s stepping into the stalled
contract talks between the  National Hockey League  and its
players.  The agency issued a statement today in Washington saying it
had been in informal discussions with the two sides, and that
the talks would now be conducted “under our auspices.”  The independent U.S. government service, headed by George H. Cohen, specializes in labor disputes. The service has been part
of previous contract negotiations with the  National Football
League  and  National Basketball Association . Mediators are often
brought into disputes in an attempt to restart stalled talks and
provide guidance to the two sides. A mediator’s ruling isn’t
binding.  “While we have no particular level of expectation going
into this process, we welcome a new approach in trying to reach
a resolution of the ongoing labor dispute at the earliest
possible date,” Bill Daly, the NHL’s deputy commissioner, said
in a statement.  Jonathan Weatherdon, a spokesman for the  NHL Players’
Association , confirmed the mediation and said the union had no
additional comment.  The NHL locked out players on Sept. 16 and the dispute has
forced the cancellation of more than a third of the regular
season, including the outdoor Winter Classic, plus the All-Star
Game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
