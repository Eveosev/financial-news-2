Crude oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures weakened on concern about the progress of
budget talks in Congress and the outcome of meetings in  Europe 
over bailout terms for Greece.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.94 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange as of 1:15 p.m., up from 27.14 percent on
Nov. 23. January-delivery crude oil fell 46 cents to $87.82 a
barrel on the Nymex.  President   Barack Obama â€™s administration is negotiating
with a divided Congress to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, a
$607 billion combination of automatic spending cuts and tax
increases scheduled to take effect in January. European finance
ministers were meeting today for a fourth round of talks in two
weeks to try to reach consensus on an aid package for  Greece .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $80 puts, which were unchanged at 23 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,717 lots at 1:21 p.m. January $95 calls were the
second-most active, with 1,352 lots exchanged as they slid 14
cent to 30 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 59 percent of trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, calls made up 62 percent of the
35,528 contracts traded.  January $102 calls were the most actively traded options on
Nov. 23 with 4,925 contracts. They rose 2 cents to 13 cents a
barrel. January $100 calls increased 3 cents to 17 cents on
volume of 2,836 lots.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
46,668 contracts. Next were January $60 puts, with 34,924 lots,
