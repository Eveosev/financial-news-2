NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , the best-performing
stock among Kenyan lenders this year, climbed to the highest in
almost five years on bets the shares are undervalued and that
the company’s expansion plan will boost profitability.  Shares in the Nairobi-based lender advanced 1.9 percent to
40.75 shillings by the close, the fifth day of gains and the
highest level since December 2007. About 1.14 million shares
traded, more than 10 times the three-month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It is still attractive to most investors and the reason
is because the investors feel it is not overvalued,” Ted
Macharia, a research analyst at Nairobi-based AIB Capital Ltd.,
said by phone today. “We have a valuation of 49 shillings,
others have it higher. Investors are trading on the bank’s
strong quarter-three earnings and expansion plan.”  Net income in the nine months through September climbed to
2.4 billion shillings ($28 million) from 1.77 billion shillings
a year earlier, NIC said on Nov. 22. Net interest income, the
money banks make from loans, grew 34 percent to 3.99 billion
shillings.  NIC, which raised 2 billion shillings through a rights
offer last month, will add eight outlets over the next 12 months
and start operations in eastern and central  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
