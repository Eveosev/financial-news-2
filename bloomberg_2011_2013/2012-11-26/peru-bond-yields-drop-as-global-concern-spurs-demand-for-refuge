Peruvian bonds yields fell the most
in two months, following Treasuries, as Greece’s fiscal crisis
and U.S. budget wrangling boosted the appeal of  government
securities  as a haven.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 dropped five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to a record 4.17 percent at 12:51 p.m.
in Lima, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That is the
steepest decline since Sept. 26. The price climbed 0.28 centimo
to 123.82 centimos per sol. The benchmark 10-year  U.S. Treasury 
yield fell four basis points to 1.65 percent.  Peru’s bonds rose as euro-area finance ministers met in
Brussels to discuss ways to plug Greece’s budget gap.
Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. need to find a budget
compromise to avoid triggering $607 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts in January, a so-called fiscal cliff that the
 Congressional Budget Office  has said could lead to a recession.  “People are more concerned about the fiscal cliff and
Greece than they were on Friday,” said Dirk Willer, the head of
Latin American local markets strategy at Citigroup Inc. in New
York. “Whenever Treasuries do better, most of the rates in
emerging markets do better as well.”  The sol was unchanged at 2.5890 per  U.S. dollar , according
to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The yield on the benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-denominated
bond due in March 2037 fell three basis points to 3.69 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.66
cent to 145.66 cents per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
