European Central Bank Executive
Board member Peter Praet said there are limits to what the ECB
can do to stem the sovereign debt crisis.  “There are limits to what monetary policy can and should
credibly do: monetary authorities cannot be expected to solve
problems which lie well outside their current official remit,”
Praet said in a speech in Berlin today.  “A central bank should be aware that it is constantly
required to exercise a delicate balancing act,” he said. “On
one hand, it may need to provide backstops to remove tail risks
that could otherwise result in severe downward pressure on price
stability. On the other hand, by mitigating a crisis which
largely reflects shortcomings in other policy areas and excesses
in the financial sector, the central bank may alter incentives
for different actors to correct imbalances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
