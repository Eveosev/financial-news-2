The ruble rose for a sixth day
against the dollar, the longest rally since September, as
companies bought the Russian currency to pay taxes.  The ruble appreciated 0.1 percent to 31.0225 per dollar by
1:04 p.m. in Moscow. The currency added 2.1 percent last week,
the strongest weekly gain since Sept. 16. It was little changed
against the central bank’s euro-dollar target basket and against
the euro at 40.1820.  Companies need about 450 billion rubles ($14.5 billion) to
pay mineral extraction, excise and profit taxes this week,
according to ING Groep NV. Euro-area finance ministers are
meeting in Brussels today on an updated Greek aid package.  The ruble may strengthen further and break through the
level of 31 rubles to the dollar, Dmitry Polevoy, a Moscow-based
economist at ING, said in an e-mailed note today. “If European
politicians do not disappoint, this movement can happen today.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.4850 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.4635 on Nov. 23.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose two basis points to 195,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields rose three basis points to
6.7096 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
