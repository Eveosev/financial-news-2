Swaps prices rose for thermal coal
for loading next year from  Indonesia , the world’s largest
exporter of the fuel for power stations, according to Ginga
Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the first
quarter of 2013 climbed 10 cents to $62.30 a metric ton on a
net-as-received basis on Nov. 23, Ginga said in an e-mail today.
The December contract held at $61 a ton.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the first
quarter of next year were unchanged at $84 a ton on a net-as-
received basis, the energy broker said. The swap for December
fell 10 cents at $83.80 a ton.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with better-quality stock.
Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100 per kilogram,
according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
