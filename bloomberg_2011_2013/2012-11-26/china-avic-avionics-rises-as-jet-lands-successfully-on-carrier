China Avic Avionics Equipment Co. (600372) , a
listed unit of the nation’s biggest state-owned plane maker,
headed for its second daily gain in 10 trading sessions after
the country successfully landed a fighter jet on its first
aircraft carrier.  The stock rose as much as 2.7 percent in Shanghai and was
trading 1.9 percent higher at 13.74  yuan  at the mid-day break.
The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.04 percent.  A J-15 fighter, built by another unit of Aviation Industry
Corp. of China, touched down on the carrier Liaoning, the first
time a Chinese aircraft has landed at sea, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported Nov. 24. The Liaoning, named after a
Chinese province, was commissioned in September.  “It’s the influence of the  aircraft carrier  fighter jet,
as it was launched successfully,” said Ye Guoji, an Shenzhen-
based analyst at Ping An Securities Co. who  recommends buying 
shares of China Avic Avionics. “In the longer term, it’s not a
huge impact, unless they build a lot of carriers. They don’t
need that many anyway. But overall for them, it’s good news.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
