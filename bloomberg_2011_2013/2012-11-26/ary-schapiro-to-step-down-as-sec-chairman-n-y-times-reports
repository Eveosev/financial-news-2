Mary Schapiro, who led the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission through the aftermath of the
2008 credit crisis and  Bernard Madoff ’s multi-billion dollar
fraud, is stepping down as the agency’s chairman, the New York
Times said today, citing Obama administration sources.  Schapiro, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in
2009, will leave the SEC amid criticism from lawmakers and
investors over the agency’s handling of new responsibilities
imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and its failure to hold
individuals accountable for the worst economic collapse since
the Great Depression.  SEC spokesman  John Nester  didn’t immediately respond to a
request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
