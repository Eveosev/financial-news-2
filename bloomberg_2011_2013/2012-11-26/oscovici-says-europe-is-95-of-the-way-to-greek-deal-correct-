(Corrects quote in second paragraph.)  European governments are “within
reach” of an accord on  Greece ’s financing, French Finance
Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said.  A deal is “practically finalized, there are just a few
centimeters to go,” Moscovici told reporters before a meeting
of euro finance ministers in Brussels today. “We have 95
percent of an accord that is possible right away.”  He added: “Consensus is within reach if we are capable of
seizing it. If everyone is reasonable, we can do it quickly
enough.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
