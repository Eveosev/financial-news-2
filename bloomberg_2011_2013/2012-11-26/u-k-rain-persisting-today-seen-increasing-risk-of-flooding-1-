Areas of the U.K. may receive a
further 70 millimeters (2.8 inches) of rain “over the next day
or so,” increasing flood risk after excess precipitation in the
past week, the  Met Office  said.  Parts of northern  England  and north  Wales  may have the
highest totals today, the national weather forecaster said in a
 statement  on its website. The regions may also experience strong
winds, it said.  “We are expecting more flooding today, and we would urge
people especially in southwest, central and northern England and
Wales to use the daylight hours to prepare,” Paul Mustow, head
of flood incident management, said in the statement.  There were 191 flood  warnings  and 293 alerts in place
across England and Wales as of 1:10 p.m. today, according to the
Environment Agency. Two people died during recent storms and
more than 800 homes were flooded, the  BBC   reported  yesterday.  Parts of the U.K. had more than 27 millimeters of rain in
the 12 hours up to 6 a.m. today, following  storms  that brought
more than 90 millimeters to some areas between Nov. 20 and Nov.
23, according to the Met Office. Wind gusts reached 62 miles an
hour yesterday in southeast England, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
