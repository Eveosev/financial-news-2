Supply of Emission Reduction Units
has so far exceeded 430 million metric tons, 43 percent more
than previously announced on websites belonging to countries
including Ukraine and  Russia , as well as the  United Nations .  Supplies have jumped and may rise above 500 million tons by
the end of the year, according to Wolfgang Seidel, chairman of
the UN-overseen  Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee , who
was speaking at a press conference at climate talks in Doha.  The supply figure is about 130 million tons more than
figures published by the UN Framework Convention on  Climate
Change  and on websites of supplying nations, Matthew Cowie, an
analyst in  London  for Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said today
in an e-mailed note.  ERU credits have plunged 91 percent since the end of
November last year, as muted levels of economic production in
the European Union trimmed demand, and supply of the credits
swelled. Factories and power stations participating in carbon
markets in the EUâ€™s cap-and-trade system may use ERUs to meet
part of their cap on greenhouse-gas emissions.  They dropped 16 percent today to 47 euro cents on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London at 3:34 p.m. They fell as low
as 40 cents on Nov. 15.  ERU offsets are generated by clean-technology projects
in developed countries that reduce pollution in line with limits
set by the 1997  Kyoto Protocol .  New Energy Finance boosted its forecast for ERU and
Certified Emission Reduction use in the EU market for 2012 to as
much as 800 million tons from 450 million tons previously.  To contact the reporter on this story:
