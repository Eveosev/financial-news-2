The  European Investment Bank  will
loan  Serbia  100 million euros ($130 million) to help local banks
finance small and medium-sized businesses and local
infrastructure projects.  The European Union’s lending arm will extend the funds via
Belgrade-based Raiffeisen Banka AD and Novi Sad-based Erste
Banka AD to “improve the access of Serbian SMEs and mid-cap
companies to long-term financing provided on favorable terms,”
a bank statement cited Dario Scannapieco, the vice-president
responsible for the western Balkans, as saying.  At least 70 percent of the loan amount will be allocated to
small and medium-sized companies as access to cheaper and long-
term financing are “key drivers for economic and social
progress in Serbia,” according to the statement.  The Luxembourg-based  European Investment Bank , the  World
Bank  and the European Investment Bank agreed Nov. 8 on an action
plan for eastern Europe, which includes loans and investment in
private and public-sector projects including infrastructure,
corporations and the financial industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
