Hungary ’s bond yields rose to the
highest in almost a week after Hungary’s credit rating was
lowered to two steps below investment grade by  Standard &
Poor’s .  Yields on the government’s benchmark 5-year bonds rose nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 6.47 percent by 9:42
a.m. in Budapest. The currency of Hungary, the European Union’s
most indebted eastern member, gained 0.1 percent to 282.04 per
euro, after dropping 1 percent in the wake of the downgrade on
Nov. 23, the biggest slump this month.  The country’s long-term foreign- and local-currency
sovereign ratings were reduced one level to BB, S&P said in a
statement late on Nov. 23. It cited “unorthodox” tax policies
pursued by Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government for eroding
economic-growth prospects. The grade, on par with Portugal and
Turkey, has a stable outlook, said S&P.  “The country is moving further and further away from the
prospect of returning to the group of reliable investment
destinations,” Zoltan Reczey and Gergely Palffy, analysts at
Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in a research report today,
adding that the downgrade may be negative for Hungarian bonds
and equities.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest lender, was little
changed at 3,930 forint after falling as much as 1.4 percent at
the open. The BUX Index gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
