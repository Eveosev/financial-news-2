Australia drew with South Africa in
the second cricket Test of their three-match series.  The third and final Test starts Nov. 30 in Perth. South
Africa would retain the No. 1 spot in the  International Cricket
Council â€™s Test rankings by avoiding defeat in the best-of-three
contest, while Australia can overtake the Proteas at the top
with a series victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
