FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ,  South Africa ’s
second-biggest financial company, obtained a license to run a
merchant bank in Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest
economy.  “The bank was granted a license after it met the 15
billion naira ($95.2 million) minimum capital requirement and
other conditions,” Ugochukwu Okoroafor, a spokesman for the
Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria , said by phone from the
capital, Abuja. FirstRand is expected to commence business early
next year, he said.  Nigeria’s central bank introduced modified licensing rules
for lenders as part of reforms after a debt crisis in 2009
brought the industry to the verge of collapse. Banks are either
licensed as holding companies operating local and international
units or as national, regional or specialized banks. First
Securities Discount House Ltd., based in Lagos, said on Nov. 23
it received a merchant-banking license, bringing to two the
number of such permits given by the central bank.  The license will enable FirstRand’s unit, Rand Merchant
Bank,which already has an office in  Nigeria  “to more rapidly
build out its franchise, provide products and services to the
corporate and institutional client segments,” RMB’s Chief
Executive Officer Alan Pullinger said today in an e-mailed
statement.  FirstRand once tried to buy Nigeria’s Sterling Bank Plc,
walking away after a price couldn’t be agreed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
