Serbiaâ€™s corn output contracted 45
percent this year due to poor weather conditions, while output
declines for other winter crops appear to be less severe than
originally expected, according to the latest official forecasts.  The Balkan country harvested 3.56 million metric tons of
corn this year, or one percentage point more than forecast in
September, the Statistics Office said as it published upward
revisions to its previous harvest estimates.  Sugar beet  production fell by 17.7 percent to 2.32 million
tons and sunflower output dropped by 15.9 percent to 363,355
tons. The production of both crops was initially seen falling by
23 percent. Soybean harvest shrank by 33.9 percent, rather than
42.3 percent, to 291,395 tons, the Belgrade-based office said.  Serbia, hit by weeks of drought last summer, banned sugar
beet, sunflower and soybean exports in September to protect the
local market and avoid excessive price increases.  To contact the reporters on this story:
