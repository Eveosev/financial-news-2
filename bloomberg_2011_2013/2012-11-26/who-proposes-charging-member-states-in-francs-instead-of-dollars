(Corrects to remove reference to  budget deficit  in first
and second paragraphs of story published Nov. 26.)  The  World Health Organization 
proposed requiring nations to pay half of their membership fees
in Swiss francs instead of U.S. dollars as it seeks to reduce an
imbalance between its income and expenditure in the franc.  Charging 50 percent of the biennial assessment in the Swiss
currency and half in dollars would reduce the gap between the
WHO’s income and expenditure in francs to $700 million from $1.2
billion, according to a  document  posted on the Geneva-based
agency’s website today. Charging the full amount in francs would
cut the shortfall to $200 million, according to the document. In
both scenarios the WHO’s budget would be balanced by income and
expenditure in other currencies.  The WHO has about 75 percent of its payroll costs in francs
and gets all of its mandatory contributions in dollars.
Additional voluntary contributions are made in dollars and other
currencies. The organization’s purchasing power dropped by 34
percent between 2000 and 2010 because of the strength of the
franc and the weakness of the dollar, the WHO said.  “Assessment in Swiss francs would allow the organization
to match income to expenditure in Swiss francs in the long term
and reduce the need to purchase Swiss francs, and thus
significantly reduce its biggest  currency risk ,” the WHO said
in the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
