The Australian dollar touched its
highest level in two months as euro-area finance ministers
reached agreements on  Greece ’s debt burden and its funding gap.  The so-called Aussie advanced versus most of its 16 major
counterparts as officials cut the indebted nation’s interest
rates and gave it more time to pay back rescue loans.  New
Zealand ’s currency, known as the kiwi, snapped a decline from
yesterday as a fifth day of gains in Asian stocks outweighed a
report today that showed the nation’s annual  trade deficit 
widened to the most in more than three years.  “The initial market reaction to the agreement is positive,
but we await further details to see if it’s a sustainable
solution,” said Callum Henderson, Singapore-based global head
of currency research at Standard Chartered Plc. “At the margin,
this is good news for higher-yielding currencies” such as the
Aussie and kiwi, he said.  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to $1.0479 at 5:09 p.m.
in Sydney after earlier touching $1.0490, the highest since
Sept. 21. It gained 0.4 percent to 86.24 yen. New Zealand’s
currency traded at 82.34 U.S. cents, 0.2 percent above its close
at 82.18 in  New York . It bought 67.76 yen from 67.45.  Ten-year bond yields  in Australia rose 2 1/2 basis points,
or 0.025 percentage point, to 3.29 percent. New Zealand’s two-
year swap rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating rates,
advanced one basis point to 2.64 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares gained 0.4 percent
after rising 2 percent in the previous four days.  ‘Sustainable Path’  “All initiatives decided upon today will bring Greece’s
public debt clearly back on a sustainable path,” Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told reporters after chairing
the meeting that began yesterday at 12:30 p.m. in Brussels.
“This has been a very difficult deal.”  Officials from the 17-nation currency bloc cleared a 34.4
billion-euro ($45 billion) loan installment that Greece will
receive in December, while dismissing for now calls for debt
relief that may be needed in the longer term. The measures will
help pare Greece’s debt from 190 percent of gross domestic
product in 2014 to 124 percent of GDP in 2020, a target set by
the  International Monetary Fund  as its condition for continuing
to fund the program.  In New Zealand, figures released today showed imports
exceeded exports by NZ$1.37 billion ($1.1 billion) in the 12
months ended Oct. 31, compared with a revised NZ$875 million
shortfall in the year through September. That’s the  widest gap 
since September 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
