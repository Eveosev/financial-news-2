General Electric Co. (GE) ’s lighting unit
has agreed to buy closely held Albeo Technologies Inc., a maker
of energy efficient light-emitting diode fixtures.  GE Lighting will acquire Boulder, Colorado-based Albeo to
add its fixture portfolio and enhance its offerings to its
commercial customers, the East Cleveland, Ohio-based unit said
today in a statement. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  Customers want GE-quality LED systems in “as many areas as
possible” because “the energy and maintenance savings
opportunities are huge,” said Jeff Bisberg, chief executive
officer of Albeo in an e-mailed response to questions.  Albeo will better serve customers “moving aggressively
toward an all-LED building envelope in new construction and
retrofits, including retail, commercial and industrial high-bay
applications,” GE Lighting Chief Executive Officer Maryrose Sylvester said in the statement.  The company raised about $12.8 million over the last five
years from investors Green Spark Ventures LLC, Braemer Energy
Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank, Bisberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
