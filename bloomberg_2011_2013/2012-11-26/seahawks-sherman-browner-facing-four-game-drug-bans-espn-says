Seattle Seahawks starting
cornerbacks  Richard Sherman  and  Brandon Browner  face four-game
suspensions for violating the National Football League’s
performance-enhancing drug policy, ESPN reported.  Both players tested positive for undisclosed banned
substances and have filed appeals that may be heard as early as
this week,  ESPN said , citing unidentified people in the league.  The Seahawks released a statement that they “are aware”
of the report, ESPN said. An e-mail seeking comment from Dave Pearson, a spokesman for the team, wasn’t immediately returned.
 Greg Aiello , a spokesman for the NFL, declined to comment on the
report in an e-mail.  Sherman, a 24-year-old second-year player out of Stanford
University, leads the Seahawks with four interceptions and three
forced fumbles. He had three tackles yesterday in a 24-21 loss
to the  Miami Dolphins .  “This issue will be resolved soon and the truth will come
out. Not worried,” Sherman said in a Twitter post last night.  Browner, 28, has three interceptions and two forced fumbles
this season for the Seahawks, who at 6-5 trail the San Francisco
49ers (8-2-1) in the National Football Conference West Division.
After playing at  Oregon State University , Browner had six
interceptions, scoring twice, as an NFL rookie in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
