The pound pared declines against the
dollar and euro after Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney was
unexpectedly appointed as the next head of the Bank of England.  Carney will take the helm of a British central bank that’s
preparing to become the most powerful in the world as it absorbs
broad new powers to oversee the financial system and prevent
another crisis. Ten-year gilts pared an advance that pushed
yields to the lowest in almost a week. Sterling earlier slid to
a the least in a month against the euro as European finance
ministers meet for talks on an updated aid package for  Greece .  This is sterling supportive “in the sense that he has
credibility and that he understands that financials are at the
core of the U.K. economy, which will help” the currency, said
 Sebastien Galy , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe
Generale SA in New York. “The issue is that he will try to
maintain a weak pound to help the economy rebalance but that is
not much different from his predecessor.”  Sterling fell 0.1 percent to $1.6011 at 4:09 p.m. London
time after sliding to $1.5997. It traded at 80.96 pence per euro
after earlier dropping to 81.10, the weakest level since 0ct.
24.  The 10-year gilt yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.84 percent, after sliding to 1.816
percent, the least since Nov. 20. The 1.75 percent bond due in
September 2022 rose 0.07, or 70 pends per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 99.24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
