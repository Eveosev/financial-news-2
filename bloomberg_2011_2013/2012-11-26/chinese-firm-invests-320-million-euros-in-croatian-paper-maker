China International Investment Stock
Ltd. signed a contract to invest 320 million euros ($415
million) in building a paper mill in  Croatia  with local PAN
Papirna Industrija d.o.o.  The paper- and cellulose-making facility and a geothermal
plant to supply power will be built in Slatina, western Croatia,
Winston Chia, Chief Executive Officer of the Chinese group, said
in an interview in Zagreb. The Qingdao, China-based company will
hold a 70 percent stake in the investment, while the rest will
be held by PAN Papirna Industrija.  Croatia, which is set to become the 28th member of the
European Union in July, needs foreign investment to revive its
economy after three years of recession and stagnation.
Unemployment in the nation of 4.2 million has reached 19.6
percent in November.  “This is the largest greenfield investment in Croatia,”
Marinko Mikulic, owner of Zagreb-based Pan Papirna Industrija,
said in an interview. The plant will use a hybrid reed
“specially developed” for the mill and grown locally, he said.  Financing for the project is secured by Cyprus’  Faisal
Islamic Bank of Kibris , a subsidiary of  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) ,
Chia said.  The building of the plant, which will employ about 500
people, will start within the next 12 months, Mikulic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
