Ethanol futures in Chicago climbed
against gasoline for a second day as  Brazil ’s sugarcane harvest
neared its end.  The biofuel, made from corn in the U.S. and from sugarcane
in Brazil, gained as industry association Unica said sugar mills
in Brazil’s sugarcane belt will begin to shut down in the coming
weeks. The mills crushed 42 percent more cane in the first half
of November than they did a year earlier.  “That maybe gave the market a little bit of hope that the
supply from Brazil will dry up sooner rather than later,” said
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst with Linn Group in Chicago.  Production declined 13,000 barrels a day to 811,000 in the
week ended Nov. 16, the lowest level for any week in November
since the Energy Department began publishing weekly data in
2010. Corn reached a three-week high.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline narrowed to 32.03 cents a
gallon from 35.19 cents on Nov. 23, based on December futures
prices. The difference was 99.8 cents on Sept. 28.  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 1.4 cents, or
0.6 percent, to settle at $2.406 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade. Prices have gained 9.3 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery slipped 1.76 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.7263 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for March delivery advanced 0.2 percent to close at
$7.5125 a bushel in Chicago, the highest settlement since Nov.
1. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 31 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, excluding
the revenue that can be pocketed from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can
be fed to livestock, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
