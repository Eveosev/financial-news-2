Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  products used
for a Syrian surveillance system were sold by a partner firm
that didn’t know where the gear was being shipped, the computer
maker told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a
recent letter.  Hewlett-Packard equipment worth more than $500,000 was
installed in computer rooms in  Syria , underpinning a
surveillance system being built to track citizens’ e-mails and
Internet use, Bloomberg News reported in November 2011. The
Italian company running the project, Area SpA, bought the
equipment through resellers in  Italy , according to the report.
Area has since pulled the plug on the project.  “Area did not procure the HP products believed to have
been sold into Syria from HP but instead procured those products
from an HP partner that was not informed of the ultimate
destination for those products,” Hewlett-Packard said in an
Oct. 9 letter to the SEC made public in a filing with the
commission.  Area said in November 2011 that it never had any relations
with Syrian intelligence agencies and that the company’s dealing
complied with all export rules.  Hewlett-Packard wrote to the SEC after the regulator
contacted the Palo Alto, California-based company Sept. 6
requesting comment on news reports about the equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
