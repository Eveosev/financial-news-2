A report on Residential Capital
LLC’s pre-bankruptcy transactions with parent company  Ally
Financial Inc. (ALLY)  and others will take about two months longer than
planned, the retired judge conducting the probe said.  Former U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, ResCap’s
bankruptcy examiner, said he needs until early April to get
required documents and to finish interviewing key witnesses.  “The examiner is mindful of the importance of his report
to the case and will continue to seek the discovery he needs to
complete his report,” lawyers for Gonzalez said in papers filed
today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  In July, the judge overseeing ResCap’s Chapter 11
bankruptcy, Martin Glenn, ordered a probe of the mortgage
company’s proposal to settle legal claims against Detroit-based
Ally that may be worth billions of dollars.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , the holding company run by
billionaire  Warren Buffett , requested the investigation into
ResCap’s proposal to accept $750 million from Ally to settle
potential legal liability tied to mortgage-related securities.  At the time, Berkshire owned about $900 million of ResCap’s
junior secured bonds and was trying to buy some of the company’s
assets. Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, later won an
auction for a portfolio of ResCap loans with a bid of about
$1.5 billion.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
