Nickel, this year’s worst-performing
metal, is rallying as analysts from  Standard Bank  Plc to BNP
Paribas SA forecast a smaller-than-expected supply glut in 2013.  Standard Bank reduced its estimate for the surplus by 17
percent on Oct. 15, citing project delays, and BNP Paribas said
Nov. 12 it now expects output to match demand, after cutting its
projection three times since April. Credit Suisse Group AG and
Citigroup Inc. also lowered forecasts in the past two months.
Nickel will average $19,000 a metric ton in the second quarter,
15 percent more than now, the median of 11 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Futures fell 68 percent since reaching a record $51,800 in
2007 as higher prices spurred companies from Anglo American Plc
to Vale SA to invest in new mines or expand existing ones. The
surplus started in 2011 as slower growth weakened demand for
stainless steel, which accounts for 65 percent of nickel
consumption, and new supply emerged. Analysts are now paring
supply forecasts as projects fall behind schedule. Prices
rallied 4.4 percent in the past month.  “The market balance is tighter than people had initially
thought,” said  Leon Westgate , an analyst at Standard Bank in
 London . “There are a number of operations and significant
amount of capacity that may run into various issues. In terms of
that producer wall of nickel, it may not be quite as large or
impregnable as it looks on paper.”  Metal Production  Nickel retreated 12 percent to $16,455 on the London Metal
Exchange this year as the bourse’s  LMEX gauge  of six industrial
metals gained 1.3 percent. The Standard & Poor’s  GSCI index  of
24 commodities rose 0.3 percent and the MSCI All-Country World
 Index (MXWD)  of equities advanced 9.8 percent since the beginning of
January. Treasuries returned 2.3 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. measure shows.  Refined-metal production will expand 4.9 percent to 1.75
million tons next year, as demand increases 6 percent to 1.72
million tons, Standard Bank estimates. Its projected surplus of
35,000 tons is 27 percent lower than this year and the forecast
5.8 percent advance in mine output in 2013 would be the smallest
gain since 2009. Credit Suisse expects a glut of 31,000 tons and
Citigroup a 22,300-ton supply shortfall.  More than 800,000 tons of planned or existing production
capacity is under threat of disruption in the next 12 to 18
months, according to Standard Bank. Macquarie Group Ltd.
anticipates that as much as 93,500 tons of production may be
disrupted next year, compared with 9,000 tons in 2012.  Two Quarters  Stainless-steel output will expand 3 percent to a record 35
million tons in 2013, according to Sheffield, England-based MEPS
(International) Ltd., an industry consultant founded three
decades ago.  China’s economy , the biggest producer of the alloy,
will accelerate in this and at least the next two quarters, the
mean of 37 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The
nation accounts for 40 percent of nickel demand, according to
Morgan Stanley.  China  is also one of the greatest threats to the projected
rally because of its production of nickel pig iron, a substitute
made from lower-grade ores. Output probably will be at least
300,000 tons this year and 330,000 tons in 2013, Macquarie
forecasts. Capacity may increase 500,000 tons in the next
several years, Deutsche Bank AG estimates.  The industry is spending as much as $7 billion on new
technology that lowers costs, Macquarie says. That decreases the
likelihood of smelters closing should prices slump. Estimated
overheads are now $15,000 to $16,000 a ton, compared with
$18,000 to $20,000 two years ago, according to Deutsche Bank.  Pig Iron  “It’s hard to get excited about nickel,” said  Jim Lennon ,
an analyst at Macquarie in London. “There is very little reason
to think the price can rally from where we are today, especially
given the likely surge in nickel-pig-iron production over the
next three to six months.”  NPI output may be curtailed by curbs to nickel-ore exports
from  Indonesia , where the government is trying to spur the
development of the domestic refining industry. Indonesia’s ore
yields at least 18 kilograms (40 pounds) of metal from every ton
of rock, compared with about 11 kilograms from Filipino supply,
Macquarie says. Without the higher grades, production costs will
rise “significantly,” Barclays Plc wrote in a report Nov. 8.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its projection for
growth in 2013 twice since July, to 3.6 percent. The 17-nation
euro-area’s economy tumbled back into recession last quarter for
the second time in four years. Nickel demand contracted in the
three years through 2009 as record prices curbed consumption and
economies endured the global recession, Morgan Stanley
estimates. Stockpiles in LME-monitored warehouses rose 50
percent this year, bourse data show.  Western Australia  About 25 percent of the nickel industry is operating at a
loss at current prices, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd., an
Edinburgh-based researcher.  Vale (VALE) , the second-biggest producer,
said Oct. 19 it would suspend operations at its Frood nickel and
copper mine in  Canada  and Xstrata Plc, the fourth-largest, said
Sept. 26 it will shut the Cosmos mine in  Western Australia .  Vale, based in  Rio de Janeiro , said in July it would miss
its 2012 nickel output targets after accidents halted nickel
projects in  New Caledonia  and  Brazil . Output at London-based
Anglo American’s Barro Alto project in Brazil will be impacted
after a kiln wall collapsed in October, and production at its
Loma de Niquel mine in  Venezuela  was stopped in September.  Shares of OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the biggest producer,
fell 19 percent to 4,649 rubles ($149.80) since the start of
March. The stock of the Moscow-based company will reach 5,770
rubles in 12 months, the average of 10 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg shows. Net income will increase 7.9
percent to $3.24 billion in 2013, according to the mean of five
estimates.  Production Costs  Global mine supply may start contracting in 2017 because
slumping prices and rising production costs are spurring
companies to invest in other commodities, Citigroup says.  “The history of the nickel industry is that it will shoot
itself in a foot at every opportunity with a new process,” said
 Andrew Mitchell , an analyst at Wood Mackenzie in Guildford,
 England . “History says that they do not perform in general as
well as anticipated, certainly by the owners of the projects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
