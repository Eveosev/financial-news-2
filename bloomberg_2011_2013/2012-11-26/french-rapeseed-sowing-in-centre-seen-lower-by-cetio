Winter-rapeseed sowing in  France ’s
Ile-de-France and Centre regions and Eure department, which make
up close to a third of plantings, fell from last year as drought
hurt crop development, industry researcher Cetiom said.  Sowing in the regions is down between 5 percent and 20
percent, depending on the area, Paris-based Cetiom wrote in a
 report  on its website today. Rapeseed had trouble developing due
to late sowing and difficult germination, the group said.  France is the European Union’s largest rapeseed grower,
 harvesting  1.6 million hectares (4 million acres) of the oilseed
this year, almost exclusively planted as a winter crop,
Agriculture Ministry data show. Centre, Ile-de France and Eure
jointly make up about 29 percent of France’s rapeseed surface.  In the Poitou-Charentes and Limousin regions and the Vendee
department, which account for about 9 percent of France’s
winter-rapeseed area, plantings are down about 25 percent to 30
percent from last year, Cetiom said.  Brittany, Pays de la Loire and Lower Normandy, good for
about 9 percent of winter-rapeseed area, suffered less from
drought, according to Cetiom. Less than 5 percent of planted
rapeseed was plowed under.  Cetiom reported last week that losses may reach 50 percent
in northern Burgundy and the Lorraine region, which jointly
account for more than 18 percent of France’s rapeseed surface.  To contact the reporter on this story:
