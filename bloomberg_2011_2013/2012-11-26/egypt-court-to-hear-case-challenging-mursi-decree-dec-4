An Egyptian court is set to hear a
challenge to President Mohamed Mursi’s decree that placed his
decisions above judicial review, a move that triggered some of
the biggest demonstrations since last year’s uprising against
 Hosni Mubarak .  A Cairo administrative court has set a first hearing for
Dec. 4 in the case brought by lawyers and judges including the
head of  Egypt ’s judges’ association, Ahmed el-Zind, the court
said in a faxed statement today.  “These are judicial procedures that we don’t interfere in,
but at the end of the day there’s a presidential decree,”
presidential spokesman Yasser Ali told reporters in Cairo today.  Mursi’s Nov. 22 decrees sparked five days of unrest in the
capital and other main cities and clashes between his foes and
supporters. Secular parties and youth groups have called for
mass protests tomorrow against the Muslim Brotherhood, which is
organizing its own rallies in defense of the president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
