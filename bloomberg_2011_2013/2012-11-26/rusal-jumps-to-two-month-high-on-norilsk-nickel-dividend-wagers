United Co. Rusal, the Russian
aluminum producer that holds a 25 percent stake in OAO GMK
Norilsk Nickel, climbed to the highest level in almost two
months on bets Roman Abramovich’s possible acquisition of a
stake in Norilsk will boost dividends.  Rusal rose 1.7 percent to 184.07 rubles by the close in
Moscow. The amount of shares traded was 229,520, equivalent to
1.3 times the three-month average.  Oleg Deripaska, Rusal’s chief executive officer, is urging
fellow billionaire Abramovich to buy a stake in Norilsk, three
people familiar with the matter said. Under Deripaska’s plan,
Abramovich would buy about 6.9 percent of Norilsk from the
company’s treasury stock, said the people, who declined to be
identified because talks are preliminary.  “Abramovich has been promoting higher dividends at the
companies where he is a shareholder, like Evraz, Raspadskaya,”
Valentina Bogomolova, an analyst at UralSib Capital, said by
phone from Moscow. “If he pushes for a dividend increase at
Norilsk, this would be very good for Rusal shareholders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
