Italian  consumer confidence  fell to
a record low this month as households grew more pessimistic
about the economic outlook after the country’s fourth recession
since 2001 entered its second year.  The confidence index fell to 84.8, the lowest since the
series begin in 1996, from a revised 86.2 in October, the
national statistics office,  Istat , said in Rome today. The
reading was lower than the median forecast of 86.3 in a survey
of 13 economists by  Bloomberg News .  The Italian economy  shrank  for a fifth quarter in the three
months through September as export gains failed to offset the
effects of weak domestic demand. The contraction contrasted with
signs of a recovery in Germany and France, the region’s two
biggest economies.  Italy entered into recession in the second half of 2011 as
the global slowdown aggravated the effects of Prime Minister
 Mario Monti ’s austerity measures aimed at taming a public debt
of 2 trillion euros ($2.55 trillion).  Both the government and the central bank expect a recovery
in the second half of next year amid increasing exports.
Economists and businessmen are less optimistic about a pick up
of domestic demand as unemployment tops 10 percent.  A recovery in consumer spending depends on the government’s
policies,  Tod’s SpA (TOD)  Chairman Diego Della Valle told reporters at
a luxury conference in Rome on Nov. 16. The shoemaker reported a
fall in domestic sales of 14 percent in the third quarter.  Istat originally reported an October confidence reading of
86.4.  -- Editors: Alan Crosby, Andrew Davis  To contact the reporter on this story:
