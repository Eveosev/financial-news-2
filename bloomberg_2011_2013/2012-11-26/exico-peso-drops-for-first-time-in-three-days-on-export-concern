Mexico ’s peso fell for the first
time in three days on concern demand for its exports will
decrease amid speculation European policy makers meeting today
will struggle to find a solution for  Greece ’s debt crisis.  The currency dropped 0.2 percent to 12.9909 per  U.S. dollar 
at 8:44 a.m. in Mexico City. The peso is up 7.3 percent this
year, still the best performance among the greenback’s 16 most-
traded counterparts in 2012.  Euro-area finance ministers are meeting in Brussels to try
to clear the next installment of aid to Greece after failing to
make the decisions in previous meetings this month. Mexico
posted a $1.65 billion trade deficit for October, according to
data released today, more than triple the median estimate for a
$553 million gap among economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The euro-zone finance ministers have been discussing this
situation for several weeks and they haven’t released the
resources for aid,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview.
“This is what’s making a bit of noise in the market.”  European turmoil and concern about the impact on the market
for Mexico’s exports helped make the peso the worst-performing
major Latin American currency in 2011.  Yields on Mexico’s local currency bonds due in 2024
declined one basis point, 0.01 percentage point, to 5.59 percent
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
0.07 centavo to 138.62 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
