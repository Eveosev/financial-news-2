European Union carbon permits
declined as nations may seek next month to block or abstain from
voting on a plan to temporarily fix a glut in the market.  Abstention by  Germany  on a Dec. 12 vote seeking to delay
the sale of 900 million metric tons of European Union carbon
permits starting in 2013 may prevent the measure succeeding,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Nations may delay the vote if they are not ready, Konrad Hanschmidt, an analyst for the London-based research group, said
today in an e-mailed note. A less probable scenario is that the
vote would proceed and potentially fail because the proposal
would get about 234 of 255 votes needed because of Germany’s
abstention, Hanschmidt said.  The bloc is seeking to fix the glut, which may reach 2
billion tons during the next few years, according to a draft EU
document obtained by Bloomberg News in October. That’s about the
same as a year’s total supply in the world’s biggest carbon
market by traded volume.  EU permits for December dropped as much as 1.6 percent to
6.90 euros ($8.95) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London, and were at 6.91 euros at ton at 1:12 p.m.  Six EU member states may oppose the European Commission’s
proposal to withhold supply, Hanschmidt said.  “We expect  Poland ,  Romania , the Czech Republic,  Hungary ,
 Bulgaria  and Slovakia to say ‘no’ to backloading,” as the plan
is known, he said.  United Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December fell 3.7 percent to 78 euro cents a ton on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
