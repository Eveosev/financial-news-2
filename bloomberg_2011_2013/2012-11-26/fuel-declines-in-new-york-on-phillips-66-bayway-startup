Spot gasoline and diesel fuel
weakened on the U.S. East Coast today after  Phillips 66 (PSX)  reported
emissions associated with an equipment startup at the Bayway
refinery in New Jersey.  The 238,000-barrel-a-day Bayway plant, the largest single
refinery in the New York Harbor region, flared more than 500
pounds of sulfur dioxide yesterday, according to filings with
regulators. The unit was undergoing repairs and maintenance
following  Hurricane Sandy , which went ashore in New Jersey,
leaving Bayway partially flooded and without power.  Bayway was one of at least six refineries that halted
production or cut rates as Sandy hit Oct. 29. Bayway is the last
to reopen.  Reformulated gasoline  for ethanol blending, or RBOB, in New
York Harbor slid 1.75 cents a gallon to a premium of 5 cents
over futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 11:40 a.m.
The premium for conventional gasoline for ethanol blending, or
CBOB, declined by 2.37 cents to 4.63 cents.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  retreated 0.75 cent to a premium of
20 cents a gallon versus heating oil futures.  Conventional gasoline in the U.S. Gulf Coast also weakened
versus futures as Phillips 66 was scheduled to start a fluid
catalytic cracker at its  Borger, Texas, refinery .  The 146,000-barrel-a-day refinery shut the unit for work
Sept. 24. The maintenance was expected to last until Nov. 20 and
was extended last week, the company said.  CBOB on the Gulf Coast declined by 3.37 cents to trade at a
discount of 17.75 cents a gallon versus futures. Eighty-seven
octane gasoline dropped 2.25 cents to a discount of 16.25 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
