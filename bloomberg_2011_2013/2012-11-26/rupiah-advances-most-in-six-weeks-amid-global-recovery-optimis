Indonesia’s rupiah rose the most in
ten weeks on speculation the nation recorded a  trade surplus  in
October, and as U.S. data boosted optimism a global economic
recovery is gaining momentum.  Government bonds  fell.  Overseas funds added 2.99 trillion rupiah ($311 million) to
their holdings of the nation’s sovereign debt in the first three
days of last week, finance ministry data show. U.S. consumers
spent  13 percent  more during the Thanksgiving weekend from a
year earlier, the  National Retail Federation  said yesterday.
Indonesia had a second consecutive  trade surplus  in September,
following four months of deficits, official data show. The
October figure is due Dec. 3.  “The market has turned risk-on again following positive
data from the U.S.,” said Bayu Kurniawan, a foreign-exchange
trader at PT Bank Ekonomi Raharja in Jakarta, a unit of HSBC
Holdings Plc. “We expect the  trade balance  to be positive in
October as global conditions steadily improve.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.6 percent to 9,600 per dollar as
of 4:07 p.m. in Jakarta, the most since Sept. 14, prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, dropped 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage
point, to a four-year low of 4.40 percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds maturing in
May 2022 climbed one basis point to 5.41 percent, closing prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
