OAO MegaFon (MFON) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, has received orders for all the shares of
its initial public offering, said people with knowledge of the
matter.  Orders came in at the lower half of the initial price range
of $20 to $25, the people said, adding that more orders were
expected to be confirmed as U.S. investors return from
Thanksgiving holiday today. Trading of shares will begin Nov. 28
in  London  and Moscow. The MegaFon IPO was set to raise at least
$1.7 billion, according to a MegaFon statement on Nov. 15.  Megafon had postponed an IPO marketing campaign in October,
raising investor speculation the demand may have trailed
expectations. IPOs have raised less than a third of the amount
in 2011 as equities fell out of favor amid the sovereign debt
crisis in Europe, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The sale is a part of a shareholder agreement reached in
April with  Alisher Usmanov , the Russian billionaire who controls
Moscow-based MegaFon, to resolve disputes between Stockholm-
based TeliaSonera and the venture’s local owners. Usmanov will
retain his 50 percent holding, while TeliaSonera will keep at
least 25 percent, MegaFon said this month.  Telefonica IPO  The IPO, which may be the largest in Russia since that of
United Co. Rusal’s in 2010, will have a 10 percent so-called
over-allotment option to cover extra demand, Megafon said on
Nov. 15. MegaFon and investor TeliaSonera AB are selling a
combined 15 percent stake through the transaction.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and OAO Sberbank are managing MegaFon’s
share sale, with help from Credit Suisse Group AG, Citigroup
Inc. and VTB Capital.  In October, Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG, the German
unit of  Spain ’s biggest phone company, raised 1.5 billion euros
($1.95 billion) in Europe’s largest IPO this year, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
