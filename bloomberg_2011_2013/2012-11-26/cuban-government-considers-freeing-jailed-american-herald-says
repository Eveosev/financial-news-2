Cuba’s government is considering
whether to pardon Alan Gross, a U.S. contractor imprisoned in
the Communist country, to win political concessions from U.S.
President  Barack Obama , the Miami Herald  reported today , citing
officials it didn’t name in Raul Castro’s administration.  Some in the Castro government say freeing Gross, who was
working as a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International
Development in Cuba when he was arrested in 2009, would put
pressure on Obama to loosen travel restrictions to the island
and release four Cubans serving sentences for espionage, the
newspaper reported in its  online edition .  To contact the reporter on this story:
