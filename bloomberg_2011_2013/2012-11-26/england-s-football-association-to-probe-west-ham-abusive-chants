England’s Football Association is
looking into reports of “abusive chanting” by supporters of
West Ham United at a soccer match against Tottenham yesterday.  Spurs won the match 3-1 at its White Hart Lane stadium. The
F.A. contacted the two London teams and “will continue to make
enquiries into the matter in the coming days,” the governing
body said today in an e-mailed statement.  West Ham today released a statement on its website saying
it would take action against supporters found guilty of
“inappropriate chanting.”  “During the 46 games in the Championship last season, West
Ham United had zero arrests for racism or violence, so while we
are surprised to see such reports today, we will examine any
available evidence of such conduct thoroughly and take the
appropriate action,” the team said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
