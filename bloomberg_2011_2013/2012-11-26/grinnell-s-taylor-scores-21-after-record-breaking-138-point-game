Jack Taylor  of Grinnell College was
held to 21 points in a loss to William Penn University, five
days after scoring 138 points to break college basketball’s 58-
year-old single-game scoring record.  Taylor, a 22-year-old sophomore guard at the Division III
school in Grinnell, Iowa, missed 15 of his 21 shots in
yesterday’s 131-116 home loss against William Penn (12-0). He
was 3-of-13 from the three-point range as Grinnell fell to 3-1.  Taylor had made 52 of 108 field-goal attempts, including 27
three-pointers, in a  179-104 win  over Faith Baptist Bible
College on Nov. 20. The performance broke the National
Collegiate Athletic Association record of 113 points, set by
Clarence “Bevo” Francis of Division II Rio Grande in 1954.  To contact the reporter on this story:
