About 330,000 residents of the
second-largest city in the  Dominican Republic  will gain improved
drinking water and reduce leak losses with a $25 million Inter-
American Development Bank project loan.  The Santiago de los Caballeros project is expected to
provide water  service  for at least 12 continuous hours a day for
more than 200,000 people, the development bank said in a
statement.  The funds will help finance improvements in service for 60
percent of the households in the Santiago metropolitan area, the
IDB said. The 25-year loan with an interest rate based on Libor
will replace pipes and renovate pumping systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
