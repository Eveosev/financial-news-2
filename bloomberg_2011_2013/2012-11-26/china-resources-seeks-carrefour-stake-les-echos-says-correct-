(Corrects to remove reference to China in headline and
first paragraph.)  China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291)  is
seeking to buy a stake in  Carrefour SA (CA) ,  Les Echos  reported
today, citing unidentified people.  The Hong Kong-listed company may be interested in a
partnership with the French retailer, according to the report.  Vincent Tse, a Hong Kong-based head of strategic planning
at China Resources, declined to comment. Calls to Carrefour
weren’t answered outside office hours.  Carrefour, France’s biggest retailer, is cutting jobs and
exiting overseas markets it doesn’t dominate to generate cash
and reduce debt as part of a three-year turnaround plan
formulated by Chief Executive Officer Georges Plassat. The
retailer in November agreed to sell its 60 percent stake in its
Indonesian unit to local partner CT Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
