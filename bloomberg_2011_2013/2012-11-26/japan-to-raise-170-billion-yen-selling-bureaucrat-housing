Japan ’s government plans to raise
170 billion yen ($2.1 billion) by selling 56,000 houses and
units that are currently lent cheaply to officials.  The proceeds from the sale will be spent on reconstruction
after last year’s earthquake and tsunami, Vice Finance Minister
Koichi Takemasa said in Tokyo today. The sale will be completed
over the next four years and covers about 26 percent of the
government’s housing stock for civil servants, according to a
 statement  from the Ministry of Finance.  Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s government is selling
assets and cutting administrative spending as it plans to double
the sales tax. The sale was originally  announced  last December
as Japan struggles with the world’s largest public debt.  The government will also double the rent that bureaucrats
pay for the remaining housing, starting in April 2014, according
to the statement. An unmarried official living in central  Tokyo 
would pay as much as 19,000 yen a month after the increase, up
from the current 9,000 yen to 13,000 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
