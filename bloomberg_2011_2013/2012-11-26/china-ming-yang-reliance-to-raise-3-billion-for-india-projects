China Ming Yang Wind Power Group
Ltd. (MY)  and  Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  agreed with China Development Bank
Corp. to raise $3 billion for new renewable-energy projects in
 India , the country’s planning commission said in a statement.  The bank will arrange funds after assessing plans by the
two companies to build 2,500 megawatts of generation capacity in
three years, China Ming Yang said in a separate statement.  Chinese wind-turbine makers are adding assets overseas as
the local market faces a supply glut. China Ming Yang follows
Sinovel Wind Group Co. and Dongfang Electric Corp. in winning
orders for plant equipment in India as Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  looks to boost generation to accelerate economic growth.  “The target to develop 2,500 megawatts in the next three
years looks ambitious,” said Shantanu Jaiswal, a New Delhi-
based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The likelihood
that financing from China will result in lower rates than Indian
debt offers “some comfort,” Jaiswal said.  India plans to add 118 gigawatts of generation capacity in
the five years to March 2017, more than double the volume in the
prior five-year period. It attracted a record $6 billion of
funds for wind-power projects last year, buoyed by government
incentives. Funds in the first nine months of 2012 declined 39
percent from a year earlier as policy benefits ended in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
