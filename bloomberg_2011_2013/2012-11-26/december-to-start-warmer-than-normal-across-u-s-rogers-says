December is expected to start much
warmer than usual across the U.S., with highs possibly reaching
into the 60s Fahrenheit (15 to 20 Celsius) in the Midwest and
along the East Coast, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity
Weather Group LLC.  Average temperatures from Dec. 1 to Dec. 5 may be 5 degrees
above normal in the East and in Maritime  Canada  and as much as
15 degrees higher across the Midwest, including  Chicago , said
Rogers, based in Bethesda,  Maryland .  “After cool conditions linger in the Midwest and East this
week, a strong warm-up is still slated to expand across the
nation,” Rogers said in a note to clients today. “Highs across
the Midwest and East should push into the 50s and 60s during the
period, while  Texas  sees highs in the 70s and 80s.”  Warmer temperatures affect the amount of energy used to
heat homes and businesses. The winter months are when the most
natural gas and heating oil are consumed, and cold in the high-
population areas of the East Coast and Midwest helps boost
heating demand. Meteorological winter starts Dec. 1 while the
calendar marks the season’s change on Dec. 21.  By Dec. 6, temperatures across the northern Great Plains
and the South are expected to return to seasonal levels while
remaining about 5 degrees above normal in the U.S. Northeast,
Rogers said.  “The cooling, at least at this point, is not expected to
be especially strong,” Rogers said. It’s a signal that the
warmer temperatures expected next week won’t dominate December
as a whole, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
