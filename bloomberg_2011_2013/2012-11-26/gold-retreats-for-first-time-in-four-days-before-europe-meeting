Gold futures fell for the first time
in three sessions as the dollar’s rebound eroded the appeal of
the precious metal as an alternative asset.  The greenback gained for the first time in a week against
the euro as European Union finance ministers gather in Brussels
to decide on aid for  Greece . On Nov. 23, optimism on Greece
helped send gold to $1,755 an ounce, the highest since Oct. 17.  “There is some backpedaling today because the dollar is
stronger and there is nothing new out of  Europe ,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, said in a telephone interview. “We are seeing some
profit-taking after the nice rally on Friday.”  Gold futures for December delivery slid 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,749.60 at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The
price has climbed 12 percent this year.  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold rose to
a  record  for the sixth straight session, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$34.229 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price reached
$34.315, the highest since Oct. 11.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1,611 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Palladium futures for December delivery dropped 1 percent
to $661.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
