OAO Phosagro,  Europe ’s largest
phosphate-fertilizer producer, plans to increase output of
complex fertilizers in the first quarter and cut diammonium and
mono-ammonium phosphates because of shifting demand.  Output of compleх NPK and NPS fertilizers will expand by 20
percent from the same period this year, Phosagro said today in a
statement. Diammonium and mono-ammonium phosphates, known as DAP
and MAP, will drop more than 17 percent over the same period.  Total production volumes will be unchanged.  Phosagro made 1.08 million metric tons of phosphate-based
fertilizers and 216,900 tons of nitrogen-based fertilizers in
the first quarter of 2012, the company said at the time.  “Due to our flexible production model that allows us to
produce different types of products on the same production
lines, we plan to focus on production of complex fertilizers,
which enjoy higher demand than DAP and MAP,” Maxim Volkov,
Phosagro’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
