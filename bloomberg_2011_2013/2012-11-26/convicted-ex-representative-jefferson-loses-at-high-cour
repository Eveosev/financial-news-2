The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an
appeal by William Jefferson, the former congressman serving a
13-year prison term after being convicted of accepting more than
$450,000 in bribes.  Jefferson, a Louisiana Democrat, argued unsuccessfully that
a federal appeals court improperly stretched the U.S. bribery
law when it upheld all but one of the 11 counts in his 2009
conviction.  Jefferson was videotaped in 2005 accepting $100,000 in a
leather briefcase at a hotel in Arlington, Virginia. About
$90,000 of the marked bills was later discovered in a freezer in
Jeffersonâ€™s home in  Washington .  Jefferson, 65, lost his bid for a 10th term in the  House of
Representatives  in 2008 after he was indicted on fraud and
bribery charges.  The case is Jefferson v.  United States , 12-111.  To contact the reporter on this story:
