Eli Manning threw three touchdown
passes as the  New York Giants  snapped a two-game losing streak
with a 38-10 win over the Green Bay Packers.   Manning, who hadn’t thrown a touchdown pass in the Giants’
previous three games, tossed a 16-yard scoring pass to Rueben
Randle in the first quarter to give New York the lead for good
at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  Manning also threw scoring passes to Victor Cruz and Hakeem
Nicks as the Giants improved to 7-4 and halted the Packers’
five-game National Football League winning streak. Manning now
has 200 career touchdown passes, surpassing Phil Simms for the
most in franchise history.   Andre Brown and  Ahmad Bradshaw  added rushing touchdowns for
the Giants, who were coming off their bye week.   Aaron Rodgers  had 219 passing yards and a touchdown for the
Packers (7-4), yet also threw an interception, lost a fumble and
was sacked five times.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
