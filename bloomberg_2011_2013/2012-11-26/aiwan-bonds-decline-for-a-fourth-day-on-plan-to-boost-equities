Taiwan ’s bonds dropped for a fourth
day, with benchmark 10-year yields rising to the highest in
three weeks, and the local dollar rose after the government said
it will consider measures to bolster the stock market.  Premier Sean Chen has asked Minister Without Portfolio Kuan
Chung-ming to study steps to boost the Taiex index, Cabinet
spokeswoman Cheng Li-wun said on Nov. 23. U.S. shoppers spent 13
percent more during the four-day Thanksgiving weekend from a
year earlier, the National Retail Federation said, signaling an
improvement in the world’s largest economy.  “If stocks continue to rally because of the government’s
support, some investors may pull money out of bonds,” said
Albert Lee, a fixed-income trader in Taipei at Cathay United
Bank Co. “Insurers, who are among the big players, may go into
stocks.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022
rose one basis point to 1.141 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. That’s the highest level for  benchmark 10-
year yield  since Nov. 6.  Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.1 percent to NT$29.143
against its U.S. counterpart, based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices.
The currency touched NT$28.959 on Nov. 12, the strongest level
since September 2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, fell 20
basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 3.5 percent.  Global funds bought $434 million more Taiwanese stocks than
they sold on Nov. 23, the biggest net purchase since Sept. 14,
and added $263 million to holdings today, according to exchange
data.  The overnight  interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.385
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
