Mark Adelson , Standard & Poor’s
former chief credit officer who left in August after being
demoted last year, was hired by BondFactor Co., a municipal debt
insurance startup.  Adelson joined the company as chief strategy officer and
started today, he said in an e-mailed statement. BondFactor
“plans to offer a municipal bond guaranty,” according to the
company’s website.  After helping overhaul S&P’s methods for rating
governments, banks and bonds backed by assets such as mortgages,
Adelson was reassigned to a research role in December 2011. He
left the company in the last week of August this year, Catherine Mathis, a spokeswoman for S&P, said at the time.  Adelson was hired in 2008, after S&P’s inflated ratings for
risky mortgage bonds contributed to the worst financial crisis
since the 1930s. The company’s analysts were pressured to give
their stamp of approval to complex investments to win lucrative
business from Wall Street banks, the U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations said in a report last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
