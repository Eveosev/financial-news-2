The  University of Notre Dame  remains
No. 1 in the Bowl Championship Series standings after completing
a 12-0 regular season.  Now the Fighting Irish will wait one more week to see which
Southeastern Conference opponent they’ll play for college
football’s national title on Jan. 7 in Miami.  Notre Dame assured itself of a spot in the BCS championship
game with its 22-13 victory over the University of  Southern
California  two days ago. The Fighting Irish last night claimed
the No. 1 ranking in the BCS standings for the second straight
week and are followed by the  University of Alabama  and the
University of Georgia.  Alabama (11-1) will play Georgia (11-1) in the Dec. 1 SEC
championship game in Atlanta, with the conference winner
probably in line to face  Notre Dame  for the national title.  “It’s a great opportunity to play a really good team in
the SEC Championship game,” said Alabama coach Nick Saban,
whose team has won the BCS title in two of the past three years.
“To me, in all those games that I’ve been a part of, they are
about as good as any game in the country other than the national
championship game.”  The University of Florida (11-1) is fourth in the BCS
rankings, followed Oregon (11-1), Kansas State (10-1), Louisiana
State (10-2), Stanford (10-2), Texas A&M (10-2) and South
Carolina (10-2).  To contact the reporter on this story:
