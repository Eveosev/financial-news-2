Serbia’s government hopes its fiscal
measures will boost investor sentiment and push borrowing costs
below 5 percent in 2013, Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said.  The western Balkan nation, rated BB- at  Standard & Poor’s ,
three levels below investment grade, plans to sell $2 billion of
debt in 2013 to part-finance its  budget deficit  next year.  “We will go below 5 percent with borrowing costs next
year,” Dinkic told lawmakers during a debate on the 2013
budget. Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, in office since
July 27, wants to bring the cost of its borrowing abroad to
“around 3.5 percent” during its term, Dinkic added.  The government seeks to narrow the 2013 fiscal gap to 3.6
percent of economic output from 6.7 percent this year and
ultimately balance the state’s finances by 2016, according to
the next year’s budget proposal.  Serbia sold a benchmark, five-year Eurobond worth $750
million on Nov. 14, with a 5.45 percent yield and a 5.25 percent
coupon. In September, yields on a reopened 2021 bond issue stood
at 6.625 percent.  The  International Monetary Fund  said Nov. 20 that its sees
the plan as “overly ambitious” and will wait until the spring
before resuming talks with Serbia on a new loan program.  Fiscal consolidation is “an urgent priority” as Serbia
faces “numerous challenges” and “addressing the economic
challenges requires appropriately balancing fiscal consolidation
and growth objectives,” the Washington-based lender said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
