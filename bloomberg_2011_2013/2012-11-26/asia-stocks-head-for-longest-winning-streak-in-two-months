Asian  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark regional gauge heading for its longest streak of gains
in two months, as a weakening yen boosted the earnings outlook
for Japanese exporters and U.S. consumer spending jumped during
the Thanksgiving weekend.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s largest carmaker, advanced 1.7
percent as the yen declined to a seven-month low against the
dollar.  Kangwon Land Inc. (035250)  surged 13 percent in  Seoul  after the
government approved plans for the casino and hotel operator to
expand.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  lost 2.3 percent, after closing
at a record high in Seoul on Nov. 23, as Apple Inc. sought to
add infringement claims over six more Samsung products to its
multi-billion-dollar patent lawsuit against the company.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index advanced 0.4 percent to 123.32
as of 8:08 p.m. in Tokyo. The measure is poised to gain for a
fourth day, the longest winning streak since the second week of
September. The Asian benchmark gained 13 percent from this
year’s low on June 4 through Nov. 23 as central banks added
stimulus to spur economic growth and data showed a slowdown in
 China  may be ending.  “Conditions have improved,” said George Boubouras,
Melbourne-based head of investment strategy at UBS AG’s
Australian wealth management unit. The Swiss bank has about $1.5
trillion under management. “The U.S. consumer is in better
shape.” There’s “the prospect of even further stimulus that
will drive a weaker yen going forward” in Japan.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.2 percent, a third
day of gains, as investors bet shares will extend gains after
polls showed opposition leader Shinzo Abe, who backs unlimited
monetary easing and the adoption of a higher inflation target to
spur the economy, will win a Dec. 16 election.  Yen Weakens  The yen weakened against most major peers after minutes of
last month’s Bank of Japan policy meeting showed members calling
for powerful monetary easing. A weaker yen boosts the value of
exporters’ overseas income when repatriated.  Some BOJ members said the nation’s economy entered a
recessionary phase, while one indicated the need for new ways to
boost price expectations, the minutes published today showed.  Exporters climbed. Toyota Motor gained 1.7 percent to 3,575
yen and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  advanced 2.3 percent to 806 yen. BNP
Paribas SA raised its rating on Toyota to buy from hold. Trading
volume on the Nikkei 225 was 19 percent above the 30-day average
for the time of day as Japan’s market reopened after a three-day
weekend.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.2 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
Index slid 0.2 percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose
0.3 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index climbed 0.5 percent
and Taiwen’s Taiex Index jumped 1.1 percent.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent
today. The  S&P 500  advanced 3.6 percent last week, extending its
2012 gain to 12 percent, after President  Barack Obama  expressed
confidence on a budget agreement with Congress and data from
China to  Germany  bolstered optimism about global growth.  American shoppers spent 13 percent more during the four-day
Thanksgiving weekend. Spending rose to $59.1 billion from Nov.
22 through Nov. 25 from $52.4 billion last year, the  National
Retail Federation  said in a statement. The jump occurred even as
Chicago-based researcher ShopperTrak observed a 1.8 percent
decline in sales on Black Friday, the traditional start to the
shopping season.  Euro-area finance ministers return to Brussels today to try
for the third time this month to clear an aid payment to Greece
and forge a blueprint for keeping the country a solvent member
of the 17-member single currency bloc. At stake is the
continuation of a three-year mission to return Greece to
financial health.  In  South Korea ,  consumer confidence  rose from a nine-month
low this month as the economy began to show signs of
improvement. The sentiment index was at 99 from 98 in October,
the  Bank of Korea  said in an e-mailed statement today. A reading
below 100 indicates pessimists outnumber optimists.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 13.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.6 for the S&P 500 and 12.4
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Kangwon Land soared 13 percent to 31,500 won as the company

asked for an 8.5 percent increase. Kansai gained 5.3 percent to
754 yen, and Kyushu advanced 5.3 percent to 812 yen.  Samsung lost 2.3 percent to 1.404 million won. Apple has
said that Samsung products running on the new Android “Jelly
Bean” operating system, and other products running on the “Ice
Cream Sandwich” system should be added to the case, according
to filings in San Jose federal court in California. Jelly Bean
is Google Inc.’s latest version of the Android operating system
