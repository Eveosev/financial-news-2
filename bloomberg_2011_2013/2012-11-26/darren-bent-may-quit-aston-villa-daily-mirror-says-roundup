The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the web.  Villa Exit  Darren Bent may leave Aston Villa after being dropped from
the first team, the  Daily Mirror  reported.  The England striker didn’t make the substitute’s bench for
a 0-0 draw against Arsenal at the weekend, the Mirror said.  Everton Stopper  Everton will look for a new goalkeeper to give Tim Howard
more competition, the  Daily Mail  reported.  The American stopper has made 196 straight Premier League
starts, the longest run of any player in the top division,
according to the Mail.  Shawcross Offer  Stoke offered Ryan Shawcross a six-year deal worth 45,000
pounds ($72,000) a week, the  Daily Mail  reported.  The 25-year-old England centerback would get the same pay
as teammate Peter Crouch under the terms, the Mail added.  Harte Move  Reading defender Ian Harte is set to join Millwall in the
January transfer window, the  Daily Mirror  reported.  The 35-year-old hasn’t played for the Royals since “being
given the run-around” by winger Aaron Lennon in a 3-1 loss to
Tottenham on Sept. 16, the Mirror said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
