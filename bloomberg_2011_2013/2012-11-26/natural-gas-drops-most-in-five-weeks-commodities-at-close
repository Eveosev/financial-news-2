The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  fell 2.81 points, or 0.4 percent, to
settle at 646.99 at 3:48 p.m. in  New York , led by natural gas.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  gauge  of 26 prices fell 3.1058, or
0.2 percent, to 1,577.391.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas tumbled the most in five weeks as revised
forecasts showing an unusually warm start to December signaled
reduced demand for heating fuels.  Futures fell 4.4 percent, closing with the biggest one-day
decline since Oct. 22, as companies including Commodity Weather
Group LLC predicted above-normal temperatures for the lower 48
states in the next six to 10 days. Gas rose to a 13-month high
last week on forecasts showing colder weather in early December
and a government report of a bigger-than-expected supply drop.  Natural gas for December delivery fell 17.1 cents to $3.73
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  CRUDE OIL  Oil dropped as euro-area finance ministers met to negotiate
a bailout payment for Greece and as U.S. leaders prepared to
wrestle with a budget agreement.  Futures declined 0.6 percent as officials gathered in
Brussels to discuss Greek aid less than a week after a meeting
failed to yield an agreement. Republicans and Democrats in the
U.S. need to find a budget compromise to avoid triggering $607
billion in tax gains and spending cuts starting in January.  Crude oil for January delivery declined 54 cents to settle
at $87.74 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices are down 11 percent this
year.  Brent oil for January settlement fell 46 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $110.92 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil and gasoline declined as refinery starts in the
U.S. signaled that production rates and supplies will climb.  Futures fell as Phillips 66 was scheduled to restart a
fluid catalytic cracker today in Borger,  Texas , and reported a
startup at the Bayway plant in  New Jersey , shut since  Hurricane
Sandy  struck Oct. 29. Motiva Enterprises LLC said it would begin
reopening a crude unit at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery this
month or in early December.  December-delivery heating oil slid 3.06 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $3.0465 a gallon on the Nymex, the first
decline in three days.  Gasoline for December delivery declined 1.76 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.7263 a gallon.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures fell for the first time in three sessions as
the dollar’s rebound eroded the appeal of the precious metal as
an alternative asset.  The greenback gained for the first time in a week against
the euro as European Union finance ministers gather in Brussels
to decide on aid for  Greece . On Nov. 23, optimism on Greece
helped send gold to $1,755 an ounce, the highest since Oct. 17.  Gold futures for December delivery slid 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,749.60 on the Comex in New York. The price has
climbed 12 percent this year.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to

$1,611 an ounce on the Nymex.  Palladium futures for December delivery dropped 1 percent
to $661.20 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper rose in New York, extending the biggest weekly gain
since mid-September, on speculation that European officials will
clear aid to Greece and keep the country solvent, boosting
prospects for demand.  European finance chiefs resumed talks on a bailout payment
for Greece today after negotiations stalled last week. A deal is
“practically finalized, there are just a few centimeters to
go,” French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said. Prices are
down 5.6 percent this quarter as Europe’s debt crisis threatened
global growth.  Copper futures for delivery in March climbed 0.3 percent to
settle at $3.5485 on the Comex. Last week’s 2.2 percent increase
was the biggest since the week of Sept. 14.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose less than 0.1 percent to $7,780 a metric ton ($3.53
a pound).  Aluminum and zinc were also higher in London. Tin, lead and
nickel fell.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cotton futures gained the most in five weeks on signs of
rising demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s largest
exporter. Coffee extended a slump to a 29-month low. Cocoa fell,
while orange juice and sugar climbed.  Net U.S. sales of upland cotton surged 59 percent in the
week ended Nov. 15 from a week earlier, government data show.
The price has tumbled 21 percent this year as global inventories
swelled.  Cotton for March delivery climbed 1.7 percent to settle at

the highest since Sept. 17.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to
19.15 cents a pound.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures dropped on concern that efforts by U.S.
lawmakers to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff will end up
hurting the economy and demand for higher-priced foods including
meat. Cattle futures also fell.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of equities headed for the
biggest decline since Nov. 14 in New York as lawmakers worked on
a budget deal to avoid automatic spending cuts and tax
increases, known as the fiscal cliff. Meatpackers processed
433,000 hogs today, down 0.5 percent from a week earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Wholesale-pork prices fell

percent to $1.4735 a pound in Chicago.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Soybean futures climbed to a two-week high as planting was
delayed in  South America . Grains advanced as U.S. winter-wheat
conditions were the worst in at least 27 years.  Rain in the past three days slowed soybean seeding in parts
of  Argentina , with more precipitation expected beginning Nov.
29, T-Storm Weather LLC said in a report. Dry weather this week
in southern  Brazil  and  Paraguay  will increase stress on newly
planted crops, the company said.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 0.4 percent to
close at $14.2475 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
