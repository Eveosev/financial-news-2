UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the biggest
U.S. health insurer, provided a forecast for profit next year
that was below analyst estimates as the company prepares for a
poor business environment and reductions in government revenue.  Earnings in 2013 will be $5.25 to $5.50 a share, while
revenue will be $123 billion to $124 billion, the Minnetonka,
Minnesota-based company said today in a regulatory  filing .
Analysts had anticipated $5.58 a share and $119.4 billion, based
on the average estimates compiled by Bloomberg. UnitedHealth
will hold its annual investor conference tomorrow.  Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hemsley said on Oct. 16
that analysts’ predictions for next year appeared optimistic,
given the “weak business climate and employment outlook.”
Government cuts may also slow revenue growth from Medicaid plans
for the poor and Medicare for the elderly, he said. The programs
have helped lead a surge in enrollment this year.  “Because of cost trends, they’re overly conservative on
what they think they’ll come in at,” said  Ana Gupte , a Sanford
C. Bernstein & Co. analyst in  New York , in a telephone
interview. “The revenue guidance was pretty strong.”  Shares Decline  UnitedHealth fell less than 1 percent to $53.53 at the
close of New York trading. The shares have risen 23 percent in
the past 12 months.  “We still believe that UNH’s outstanding execution and
strategic positioning can lead it to exceed this initial 2013
guidance range,”  Sheryl Skolnick , an analyst at CRT Capital
Group in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a note to clients.  CRT lowered its estimate for UnitedHealth’s earnings to
$5.54 a share from $5.70 and raised its revenue estimate to $123
billion from $121 billion.  UnitedHealth reaffirmed its 2012 earnings forecast of $5.20
to $5.25 a share in today’s statement.  Last month, UnitedHealth raised this year’s forecast after
reporting that enrollment in its Medicare and Medicaid plans
surged in the third quarter and medical costs stayed stable. It
was the third time this year the company increased the 2012
outlook. UnitedHealth added 2.1 million customers to its medical
plans from a year earlier, and the share of customer premiums
spent on health care dropped.  Cigna Corp. (CI) , the third-biggest U.S. health insurer, today
reaffirmed its profit forecasts for this year and 2013. The
shares of the Bloomfield, Connecticut-based company fell 1
percent to $52.24.  UnitedHealth on Oct. 8 agreed to pay about $4.9 billion to
buy 90 percent of  Amil Participacoes SA (AMIL3) , a Brazilian insurer and
hospital chain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
