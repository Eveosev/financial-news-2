Chinese equities  in New York
retreated from the highest level in almost three weeks on
concern the U.S. fiscal showdown and Europe’s continuing debt
crisis will limit the recovery in Asia’s largest economy.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. fell 1 percent to 92.70 yesterday,
retracing a 2.3 percent jump on Nov. 23. Air carrier  China
Eastern Airlines Corp. (CEA)  sank, while  21Vianet Group Inc. (VNET) , an
Internet data center operator, slid the most in more than a
week.  China Telecom Corp. (CHA)  traded at the widest  discount  to Hong
Kong shares since Nov. 16.  Zhongpin Inc. (HOGS) , a Chinese pork
producer, surged 15 percent after approving a $502 million
buyout offer.  The China-US gauge has  lost  15 percent since the end of
2010 as the nation endured a seven-quarter slowdown amid a
faltering global export market. China may set a growth target
for 2013 equal to this year’s eight-year low of 7.5 percent at a
meeting in December, China Business News reported. The U.S. is
seeking to avoid $607 billion of automatic tax increases and
spending cuts from coming into force next year, while European
finance ministers are meeting over a bailout payment for Greece.  “There’s no great expectations of an acceleration in
growth,” Edmund Harriss, who helps manage a $150 million equity
fund at Guinness Atkinson Asset Management, which also invests
in Chinese stocks, said in a phone interview from London
yesterday. “For the moment, people are sort of standing off a
little bit.”  E-House Drops  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 0.4 percent to $37.33
in New York, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. equities
fell 0.2 percent. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic
Chinese shares lost 0.5 percent to 2,017.46 yesterday, while the
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slipped 0.4 percent to
10,568.41.  21Vianet, based in Beijing, retreated 3.2 percent to $9.81,
the biggest one-day decline since Nov. 16, while  E-House China
Holdings Ltd. (EJ) , a property services provider based in Shanghai,
sank 3.9 percent to $3.49.  China Eastern  lost 3.2 percent to $17.36 as the nation’s
second-largest air carrier said its China United Air unit would
more than double its fleet by 2015.  American depositary receipts of China Telecom, the
country’s biggest fixed-line phone carrier, fell 2.5 percent to
$55.47, the steepest one-day decline in two weeks. The ADRs
traded at a 0.3 percent discount to the company’s equivalent
shares in  Hong Kong .  CEO Buyout  Zhongpin, a meat producer based in Changge, in China’s
Henan province, jumped to $12.50, the highest close since June
last year.  Golden Bridge Holdings and its Golden Bridge Merger Sub
Ltd. unit, both owned by Zhongpin’s chairman and chief executive
officer, Zhu Xianfu, will pay $13.50 a share for the 74 percent
of the company they and other investors participating in the
buyout don’t already own, the company said in a filing
yesterday.  Zhu proposed taking the company private in March, and the
deal, partly financed by a loan from state-owned China
Development Bank Corp, is expected to close by the first quarter
of 2013, Zhongpin said.  Chinese companies are withdrawing from U.S. exchanges as
accusations by short sellers of accounting irregularities
depress valuations. Since April 2010, 49 companies -- including
Focus Media Holdings Ltd. and  7 Days Group Holdings Ltd. (SVN)  -- have
announced their intention to go private and de-list from U.S.
markets, according to a report by  Roth Capital Partners  issued
Nov. 5. Excluding Zhongpin, 19 companies have completed their
buyout deals.  Static Target  Premium  Wen Jiabao  cut China’s growth target to 7.5 percent
for this year, the lowest goal since 2004 and down from 8
percent in 2011, as exports slumped and the government damped
gains in the real estate market. Policy makers may maintain the
target at the same rate in 2013 to maintain continuity of
policy, China Business News reported, citing people it didn’t
identify.  Pu Yonghao, regional chief investment officer for the Asia
Pacific at UBS AG’s wealth management unit in Hong Kong, said
he’s betting that Chinese stocks will rally as the economy shows
signs of revival.  Huaneng Coal  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011)  retreated 1.9 percent to
$32.37 in New York. The benchmark Chinese price for coal used in
power stations fell to the lowest level since Oct. 7 as
inventories at the port of Qinhuangdao increased, according to
data issued yesterday from the China Coal Transport and
Distribution Association.  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ) , a mobile  Internet service provider , slipped
1.8 percent to $6.09 after soaring 9.9 percent on Nov. 23. The
Beijing-based company said it may use its cash to buy as much as
$20 million of its own shares over the next 12 months, according
to a PR Newswire statement yesterday. The current share price
“severely undervalues” the company and the buyback program
reflects the management’s belief in its business, according to
the statement.  NQ stock has lost 43 percent since rising to a 2012 peak in
May. The company now  trades  at 6.6 times its estimated earnings
over the next 12 months, from 8.1 times a month ago, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
