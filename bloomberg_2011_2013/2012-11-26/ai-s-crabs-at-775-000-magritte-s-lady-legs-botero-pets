Mary Boone Gallery in Midtown
Manhattan is temporary home to 2,500 river crabs.  The gray-and-red, handmade porcelain creatures are part of
Ai Weiwei’s 2010 installation “He Xie,” which alludes to an
episode from the artist’s past.  In 2010, the Chinese government decreed that Ai’s newly
constructed Shanghai workshop was illegal. In response, the
artist invited devotees to the studio for a dinner of 10,000
river crabs and was promptly arrested. The workshop was torn
down early last year.  At Mary Boone, the crabs are gathered around a white column
at the center of the main room. Unrecognizable at first, they
soon reveal lifelike features and appear to be crawling on top
of one another.  Also on view is “The Crab House,” a video about the
studio, as well as documentary photographs.  Prices range from $125,000 to $775,000 for “He Xie.”
“Forge,” at 745 Fifth Ave. through Dec. 21, continues at the
gallery’s Chelsea location. Information: +1-212-752-2929;

surrounded by two attractive nurses and Rene Magritte sports a
woman’s legs.  “Red Grooms/Torn From the Pages,” at Marlborough Gallery,
features Grooms’s mixed-media creations that place artists in
their own works.  Henri Matisse completes one of his paintings with palette
in hand. Louise Bourgeois looks at her sculpture “Lair” from a
“Lair”-shaped hole on a white canvas. Andy Warhol snaps
photographs while being observed by his own Elvis, Marilyn and
Mao.  In the adjacent room are some of Fernando Botero’s
oversized creations. They’re smaller than his well-known
monumental sculptures, with heights between 12 inches and 50
inches, but still imposing.  There are couples dancing, human figures lying, standing or
attempting graceful ballet poses, and many animals. The one I
would take home is a cute, chubby bird. Almost all of the works
are in bronze.  The gallery won’t disclose prices. The shows are at 40 W.
57th St. through Dec. 1; +1-212-541-4900;

photography to give his images special effects.  For the works on view in the show “Rock Paper Scissors,”
at Bonni Benrubi Gallery, the Boston-based artist uses a
lightproof tent with a periscope as a camera obscura, capturing
a view from outside the tent and blending it with the ground
inside.  So his Golden Gate Bridge magically rests on what looks
like a gray sky with green clouds but is actually arid ground
with grassy patches.  “Depending on the quality of the surface terrain, these
views can take on a variety of painterly effects,” Morell
writes in the press release.  In the 2012 “Paper Self,” the artist shapes a pile of
paper to form his face in profile. In “Cutout, Piranesi:
Metropolis,” building images cut from a Piranesi book are
arranged into a fabulous Babel-like structure.  Prices range from $5,000 to $24,000. The show is at 41 E.
