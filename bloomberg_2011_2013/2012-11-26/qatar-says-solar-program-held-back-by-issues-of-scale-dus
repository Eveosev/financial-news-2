Qatar’s effort to expand its solar
industry is being held up by issues including the scale of the
projects planned and dust that blows in from desert areas, one
of the nation’s most senior leaders said.  “We are one of the biggest believers in solar,” said
Abdullah Bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, a former energy minister who is
chairman of  Qatar Electricity & Water Co. (QEWS) , said at a press
conference in Doha today. “We have some technology problems. I
am a big believer that technology will solve it.”  He said Qatar’s projects will cover huge areas and require
careful planning and that “we are receiving a lot of dust from
the frontier areas, and the dust is one of the challenges. It
reduces sharply the efficiency of solar.”  Qatar, which is hosting this year’s  United Nations  climate
talks, plans to install 1,800 megawatts of solar power capacity
by 2014, government-backed venture said on Oct. 17.  The nation aims to boost solar power as part of plans to
meet 20 percent of its energy demand from renewable sources by
2030, Qatar Solar Technologies said in a statement at the time.
QSTec is a venture between state-controlled  Qatar Foundation ,
Germany’s  SolarWorld AG (SWV)   and the Qatar Development Bank.  Qatar, which has no large renewable energy plants, joins
Saudi Arabia, Dubai and  Abu Dhabi  in announcing clean energy
plans to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and related emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
