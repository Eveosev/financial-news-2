Britons’ discretionary  spending
power  stagnated in October following two months of improvement
as inflation eroded salary increases and consumers spent more on
essential goods, according to Lloyds TSB.  U.K. consumers’ spending power for non-essential items
after inflation was unchanged from a year earlier, after
increasing 0.2 in September and 0.6 percent in August, the unit
of Lloyds Banking Group Plc said in an e-mailed report released
in London today. Spending on non-discretionary goods such as
food and drink rose 3.2 percent last month from a year earlier.  Lloyds said consumers are yet to see cooling inflation
translate into surplus money once essential spending has been
taken into account. October’s data follow “a period of
relatively weak income growth in real terms, whereby inflation
has kept pace with the moderate increases in income,” it said.  In a separate report, the Confederation of British Industry
said a quarterly index of confidence among consumer-services
companies such as hotels and restaurants of their business
situation jumped to 5 this month from minus 23 in August. A
measure of sentiment among business and professional-services
firms such as law firms and accountants jumped to 22 from minus
11. The CBI said the survey was conducted between Oct. 26 and
Nov. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
