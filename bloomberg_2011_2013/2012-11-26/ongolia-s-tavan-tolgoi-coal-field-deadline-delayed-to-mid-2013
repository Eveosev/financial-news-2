Mongolia may delay the selection of
companies to develop part of the nation’s biggest coal field to
the middle of 2013 from the end of this year, a government
mining official said.  Bidders for the West Tsankhi area of the Tavan Tolgoi
deposit “have proposed very attractive offers and the
government will discuss with each of them in detail and decide
which offer has higher value,” Nemekhbayar Enkhbayar, head of
the economy, finance and investment division in the  Ministry of
Mines , said in an interview in Hong Kong today. “We have to
take the geographical situation into account and Chinese
companies have big advantages on this.”  Companies such as  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , China’s Shenhua
Group Corp. and Japan’s  Mitsui & Co. (8031)  have expressed an interest
in developing the field. Mongolian President Tsakhia Elbegdorj
set an end-of-year deadline for picking the successful bidders
in July.  Tavan Tolgoi is less than 200 kilometers (124 miles) from
Mongolia’s border with China. Shenhua, the country’s biggest
coal producer, won a 40 percent stake to develop the project in
July 2011 before the Mongolian government suspended the sale and
ordered a review that is still continuing.  Successful bidders will have to promise “maximum returns”
and no company, including Shenhua, is guaranteed participation,
Enkhbayar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
