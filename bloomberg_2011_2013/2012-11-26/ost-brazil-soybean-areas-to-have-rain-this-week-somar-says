Most of  Brazil â€™s soybean areas are
going to have rain this week, allowing the planting to speed up
in the country, which is expected to surpass the U.S. as the
biggest grower of the oilseed, the weather consultant Somar said
in an e-mailed report today.  The corn growing areas in the western part of the country
are supposed to have rain this week, but in the south of the
country the weather is expected to remain dry, hurting
production, Somar said in a separate report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
