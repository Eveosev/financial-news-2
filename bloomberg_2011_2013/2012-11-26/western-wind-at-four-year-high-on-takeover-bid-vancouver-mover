Western Wind Energy Corp. (WND) , the
renewable-power developer that won a proxy fight in September,
reached a four-year high after Brookfield Renewable Energy
Partners LP announced a plan to bid for the company.  Western Wind , for sale since July 29,  gained  13 percent to
C$2.75 at the close in Toronto, the highest since July 21, 2008.
Hamilton, Bermuda-based Brookfield, which owns 16 percent of
Western Wind, offered C$2.50 ($2.51) a share in cash, according
to an announcement after markets closed on Nov. 23.  “Due to level of interest and offer price, we believe more
offers will be presented,” Ian Tharp, a Toronto-based analyst
at CIBC World Markets Inc., said in a note today.  Brookfield’s offer, more than twice Western Wind’s closing
price on July 27 before the sales process started and 3 percent
higher than the Nov. 23 close, is “too low,” Western Wind
Chief Executive Officer Jeff Ciachurski said in a statement
today, pledging to get a “better price” for shareholders.  Interest from other companies currently assessing
Vancouver-based Western Wind implies “a value significantly
greater than that which Brookfield intends to offer,”
Ciachurski said.  Western Wind, which operates wind farms in California and
 Arizona , won a proxy battle with San Francisco shareholder
Savitr Capital LLC for board control in September. Brookfield’s
bid, open until Jan. 28, needs approval from shareholders other
than Brookfield owning more than 50 percent of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
