Soybeans rose in  Chicago , extending
the biggest weekly gain in three months, on concern dryness in
Brazil and rain in Argentina will threaten supply as demand
strengthens in leading global consumer China.  In Brazil, the world’s biggest exporter, 77 percent of
crops were planted, down from 86 percent a year earlier,
researcher AgRural Commodities Agricolas said yesterday. About
37 percent of Argentine soybeans were sown, against 47 percent a
year ago, the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said Nov. 22.  China 
bought 16.8 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans since Sept. 1,
up 14 percent from a year ago and 62 percent of total U.S.
shipments, Department of Agriculture data show.  “There’s still some concern about dryness in northern
 Brazil  and some wet weather that’s delayed plantings in
Argentina,” Victor Thianpiriya, an analyst at Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said by phone from  Singapore . “With
the break in prices we’ve seen since the September highs, we’ve
started to see demand come back.”  Soybeans for delivery in January advanced 0.6 percent to
$14.2725 a bushel at 7:24 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The oilseed climbed 2.6 percent last week, the best performance
for a most-active contract since the five days ended Aug. 24.  Soybeans surged to a record in September after the worst
U.S. drought in half a century parched fields. Prices have since
slumped 20 percent, trimming this year’s gain to 18 percent.
Researcher Oil World cut its output-growth forecast for  South
America  by 8 percent on Nov. 20.  Corn, Wheat  Corn for delivery in March added 0.7 percent to $7.5475 a
bushel. The grain touched $7.57, the highest price since Nov. 9.  Wheat for March delivery rose 0.4 percent to $8.65 a
bushel. In Paris, milling wheat for January delivery gained 0.3
percent to 270.50 euros ($350.70) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Prices
are up 33 percent this year in Chicago and 39 percent in Paris
after dry weather cut yields in  Russia  and eastern  Europe  and as
U.S. winter crops are threatened by drought.  U.S. exporters sold 657,416 tons of wheat in the week ended
Nov. 15, more than double the prior week’s amount, the USDA said
Nov. 23. U.S. grain is becoming more competitive for buyers in
North Africa after price gains in Paris outpaced Chicago, Arnaud
Saulais, a broker at Starsupply Commodity Brokers in Nyon,
 Switzerland , said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
