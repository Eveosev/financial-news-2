The U.S. Supreme Court let stand a
$20 million award against  R.J. Reynolds  Tobacco Co. and a second
cigarette maker, rebuffing the tobacco industry’s latest effort
to derail thousands of Florida suits.  The justices today refused to hear a joint appeal from R.J.
Reynolds and  Vector Group Ltd. (VGR) ’s Liggett unit. A jury said the
two companies were responsible for the death of Janie Mae Clay,
who smoked for 40 years and died in 2003 of lung disease.  Tobacco companies are seeking to limit the effect of a 2006
Florida Supreme Court decision, which said a jury’s factual
findings against the industry in a class-action case could serve
as the starting point for individual suits. Cigarette makers say
Florida trial judges are applying the findings too broadly,
depriving the companies of their right to defend themselves.  About 8,000 plaintiffs have cases pending in Florida
courts, Reynolds and Liggett said in their appeals. About 65 of
those cases have gone to trial, with total awards surpassing
$300 million.  The  Supreme Court  rejected a group of company appeals
raising similar arguments in March.  R.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, is
a unit of  Reynolds American Inc. (RAI)   The case acted on today is R.J. Reynolds v. Clay, 12-272.  To contact the reporter on this story:
