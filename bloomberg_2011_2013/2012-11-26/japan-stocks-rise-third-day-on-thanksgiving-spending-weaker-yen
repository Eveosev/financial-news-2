     Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark equity gauge closing at the highest level in seven
months, on speculation the opposition may win next month’s
elections and press the central bank for more aggressive
monetary easing.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)  and other lenders
climbed as minutes of the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting showed
it will continue with powerful monetary easing.  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest carmaker by market value that gets a
quarter of its sales in  North America , added 1.7 percent after
U.S. consumer spending increased over the Thanksgiving weekend.
 Kansai Electric  Power Co. and Kyushu Electric Power Co. paced
gains among utilities on a report they will seek rate increases.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained 0.2 percent to close at
9,388.94 in Tokyo, the highest since April 27. About two stocks
rising for each that fell on the measure, which pared an advance
of as much as 1.3 percent today. The gauge has gained 8.4
percent since Nov. 14, when Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  called
for a Dec. 16 election, triggering speculation the opposition
may win and call for more monetary easing.  “The market continues to get support amid hopes for a
political leadership change,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief
strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which
manages the equivalent of about 5 trillion yen ($61 billion).
“Expectations should push stocks until the election. We will
see how the market will price in whether politicians can execute
their pledges when the Diet starts a regular session next
year.”  Volume Rises  Trading volume on the Nikkei was 19 percent above the 30-
day average after Japan’s market reopened from a three-day
weekend. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index advanced 0.4 percent to 779.50.  The Topix traded at 0.9 times book value as of last week,
compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5
for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means
that companies can be bought for less than the value of their
assets.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  should execute aggressive monetary
easing, and the government should be involved in setting goals
for monetary policy, Shinzo Abe, who heads the opposition
 Liberal Democratic Party , said on a TBS broadcast Nov. 24. Polls
suggest Abe will probably become next premier after elections
next month. His policy stance has helped the yen weaken to a
seven-month low against the dollar.  Banks gained as minutes of the BOJ’s Oct. 30 meeting showed
today that its members said the bank will continue with powerful
monetary easing. Mitsubishi UFJ added 0.3 percent to 377 yen,
and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest lender by
market value, rose 0.8 percent to 131 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., the No. 2, added 0.5 percent to 2,588 yen.  Bullish Options  The cost of options to protect against losses in a fund
tracking Japanese shares slipped, touching the lowest level in
almost seven years on Nov. 16, on speculation a new government
will enact stimulus and weaken the yen.  Puts protecting against a 10 percent drop in the iShares
MSCI  Japan  Index exchange-traded fund on Nov. 16 cost 0.99 times
more than calls betting on a 10 percent advance, according to
data on three-month options compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest level since Jan. 18, 2006.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent
today. The  S&P 500  advanced 1.3 percent on Nov. 23. American
shoppers spent 13 percent more during the four-day Thanksgiving
weekend. Spending rose to $59.1 billion from Nov. 22 through
Nov. 25 from $52.4 billion last year, the  National Retail
Federation  said in a statement.  Exporters Rise  “The U.S. shopping season is starting on a positive note,
but I’d like to see more data through at least the second week
of December as you can’t grasp the whole trend yet,” said
 Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of about 1.79 trillion yen
($21.8 billion). “The Nikkei is rising toward 9,500 yen after
breaking above the range since June,”  Exporters to the U.S. advanced, with Toyota rising 1.7
percent to 3,575 yen.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second largest
carmaker by revenue, rose 2.3 percent to 806 yen.  Utilities gained  the most  among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups after the Asahi newspaper reported Kansai Electric is
seeking a 12 percent jump for household electricity rates and
Kyushu Electric asked for an 8.5 percent increase. Kansai gained
5.3 percent to 754 yen, and Kyushu advanced 5.3 percent to 812
yen.  Renesas Electronics Corp. surged 17 percent to 337 yen
after the Nikkei newspaper reported a government-backed fund
will buy two-thirds of the unprofitable Japanese chipmaker.  Nipro Corp. jumped 9.5 percent to 622 yen after the maker
of medical products said it has developed an automatic incubator
for mass production of induced pluripotent and embryonic stem
cells.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 4.9 percent
to 18.86, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.4 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
