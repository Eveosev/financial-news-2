Ndamukong Suh of the Detroit Lions
won’t be suspended after his foot struck Houston Texans
quarterback  Matt Schaub  in the groin during a Nov. 22 game.  The National Football League notified the Lions yesterday
that Suh wouldn’t be banned, though the play will be reviewed
for a potential fine,  Greg Aiello , a spokesman for the league,
said in a Twitter post.  Suh, a defensive lineman, didn’t receive a penalty for the
incident, in which he fell to the ground and rolled over a
Houston offensive lineman before his foot extended and kicked
Schaub. NFL executive vice president of football operations  Ray
Anderson  said last week it was an “unnatural football motion.”  The play came one year after Suh stomped on the arm of a
Green Bay Packers’ player in another Thanksgiving Day holiday
game. He was suspended for two games for that infraction and
offered a public apology. Suh was fined three times by the NFL
prior to last year’s suspension and met with league Commissioner
 Roger Goodell  in New York last year to discuss how to better
play within the rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
