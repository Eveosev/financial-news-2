since last year’s uprising against  Hosni Mubarak .  A Cairo administrative court has set a first hearing for
December 4 in the case brought by lawyers and judges including
the head of  Egypt ’s judges’ club, Ahmed el-Zind, the court said
in a faxed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
