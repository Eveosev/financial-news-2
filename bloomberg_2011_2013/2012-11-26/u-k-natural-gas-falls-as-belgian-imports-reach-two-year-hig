U.K. natural gas for within-day
delivery declined for the first time in seven days as imports
from  Belgium  jumped to the highest in almost two years. Day-
ahead power dropped.  The contract fell as much as 3 percent, the most since Nov.
1, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Imports from
Belgium were at a rate of 42 million cubic meters a day, the
highest since December 2010,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Gas for today dropped 1.25 pence, or 1.9 percent, to 66
pence a therm at 9:14 a.m. London time.  Month-ahead gas  lost 1.2
percent to 67.7 pence a therm. Thatâ€™s equivalent to $10.84 per
million British thermal units and compares with $3.84 per
million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Imports from  Norway  were at a rate of 102 million cubic
meters a day, National Grid data show.  The  delivery network  will contain 343 million cubic meters
of gas at 6 a.m. tomorrow, up from 335 million at the start of
today, grid data show.  Gas accounted for 28 percent of U.K. power production at
9:15 a.m., National Grid data show. Coal generated 43 percent,
nuclear 16 percent and wind 6 percent.  Day-ahead electricity  dropped 4 percent to 48 pounds a
megawatt-hour, broker data show.  RWE AG (RWE)  started three 400-megawatt units at its natural gas-
fired Pembroke power station, and three 500-megawatt plants at
its Didcot-A site, according to National Grid data. Electricite
de France SA delayed the start of the 625-megawatt unit 7 at its
Heysham-2 nuclear reactor to Dec. 4 and started the 600-megawatt
unit 1 at its Heysham-1 reactor, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
