Encana Corp. (ECA)  said the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency made errors when it found that
chemicals used in extracting natural gas through hydraulic
fracturing were found in an aquifer in Wyoming.  The EPA’s study didn’t take into account naturally-
occurring chemicals in deep wells in the area and the
possibility that the agency’s own test well may have
contaminated water samples with unset cement, said  David
Stewart , Encana’s environment, health and safety lead in the
region, in a conference call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
