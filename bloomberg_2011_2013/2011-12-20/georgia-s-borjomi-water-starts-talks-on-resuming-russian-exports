The maker of Georgian mineral water
Borjomi, which has been banned from  Russia  since 2006, plans to
resume sales in the country next year,  IDS Borjomi International  
said today.  The company, based in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, held
talks Dec. 14 over possible exports with Russia’s consumer
watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, according to a statement on its
website today.  Russia prohibited imports of Georgian mineral water and
wine in 2006 after Georgia expelled four Russian servicemen who
it accused of espionage. Georgia last month backed Russia’s bid
to join the  World Trade Organization , clearing the way for
membership in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
