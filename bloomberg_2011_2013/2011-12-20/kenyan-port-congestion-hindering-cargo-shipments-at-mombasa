Kenya ’s port at Mombasa is congested
with more than 10,000 containers which are disrupting the
movement of other cargo traffic, the Kenya Ports Authority said.  The build-up of containers is due to delays by importers
from Uganda,  Southern Sudan , Kenya and other neighboring
countries in collecting their shipments, Twalib Khamis, general
manager of operations, said in a statement published in the
Nairobi-based Daily Nation newspaper today.  The congestion has led to ships waiting for “long
periods” at the port, Khamis said, without saying why importers
aren’t collecting their containers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
