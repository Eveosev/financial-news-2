The naira erased declines,
appreciating the most in about two months after  oil companies 
sold dollars amid falling demand for the U.S currency.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer appreciated
by 1.7 percent, the most since Oct. 25, to 159.5 per dollar in
interbank trading by 4:15 p.m. in Lagos, after earlier
retreating less than 0.1 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “There is information that some oil companies sold
dollars, which eases pressure on the naira,” Abubakar Mohammed,
managing director of Forward Marketing Communications Bureau De
Change Ltd., based in Lagos, said today by phone. “The other
reason is that companies are ending their businesses for the
year, so demand for dollar has reduced.”  The  Central Bank  of  Nigeria  lowered on Nov. 21 the midpoint
of its exchange-rate band at its twice-weekly auctions to 155
naira per dollar from 150 naira as rising imports and weakening
oil prices increased pressure on the currency. Sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s second-biggest economy depends on oil exports for more
than 95 percent of its foreign income, according to the  Finance
Ministry . The country will end its twice-weekly foreign currency
auctions for the year tomorrow.  Yield on Nigeria’s bonds due 2018 rose 16 basis points to
15.84 percent yesterday from Dec. 16. The 10-year notes have
fallen 51 basis points from a high on Nov. 11, according to
prices on the  Financial Markets Dealers Association  website.  Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi kept the benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged at  12 percent  on Nov. 21 for the first
time this year.  Ghana’s cedi strengthened by less than 0.1 percent to
1.6395 per dollar as of 4:15 p.m. in Accra, the nation’s
capital.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
