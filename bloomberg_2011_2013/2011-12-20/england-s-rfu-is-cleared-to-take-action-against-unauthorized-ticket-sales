England ’s Rugby Football Union was
cleared to take action against people who breached its ticket-
selling regulations after the dismissal of a court appeal.  Viagogo Ltd., an agency used by fans and brokers to resell
tickets, appealed a ruling made earlier this year allowing the
RFU to identify and sanction those selling their seats to
matches on the secondary market. The U.K. Court of Appeal
dismissed the company’s request today, the RFU said in a
statement.  “Placing tickets for sale on secondary ticketing sites is
in direct contravention of the RFU’s ticketing terms and
conditions and, if the seller can be identified, they face tough
sanctions including possible court action,” Sophie Goldschmidt,
the RFU’s chief commercial officer said.  Justice Michael Tugendhat in March required Viagogo to
reveal the names and addresses of those who placed tickets on
sale on its website for England’s 2010 international matches and
this year’s Six Nations tournament.  The RFU said its ticketing terms and conditions allows
member clubs to sell allocated seats to other clubs, friends and
family at face value and to seven official licensed operators
who pay the governing body royalties which are put back into the
sport. Viagogo is not one of the official ticket agents.  The RFU, when it receives the information, said it will be
able to take action against the offenders. The ruling body said
it will also take the same position with other similar websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
