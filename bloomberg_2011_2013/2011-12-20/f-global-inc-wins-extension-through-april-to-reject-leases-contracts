MF Global Inc., the failed brokerage
winding down in bankruptcy, won more time to decide whether to
keep or end contracts and leases with its business partners.  James Giddens, a trustee overseeing the company’s
liquidation, now has until April 30 to decide which leases to
reject. Under bankruptcy law, he previously had 60 days from MF
Global’s Oct. 31 bankruptcy filing.  Jeffrey Margolin, a lawyer for the trustee, said more time
was needed to evaluate the contracts, three of which have
already been rejected.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in  Manhattan  today also
approved the company’s request to transfer a lease for its
Washington office space. Giddens will transfer the lease to
Guggenheim Securities LLC in exchange for the return of a
$250,000 security deposit, less $38,356.14 for outstanding rent
and $20,000 for fixtures and furniture.  The brokerage’s parent company, MF Global Holdings Ltd.,
once run by former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  co-chairman Jon Corzine, filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy after a wrong-
way $6.3 billion trade on its own behalf on bonds of some of
 Europe ’s most indebted nations.  The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan). The parent’s bankruptcy case
is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court ,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
