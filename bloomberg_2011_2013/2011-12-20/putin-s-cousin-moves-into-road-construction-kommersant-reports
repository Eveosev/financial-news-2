Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s
cousin Igor Putin’s Surguttruboprovodstroy pipeline builder is
expanding into road construction, Kommersant reported, citing an
unidentified company official.  Surguttruboprovodstroy acquired Su-888 after the builder
won a 1.3 billion-ruble ($40 million) contract to build a road
in the Yakutia region of Siberia, the Moscow-based newspaper
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
