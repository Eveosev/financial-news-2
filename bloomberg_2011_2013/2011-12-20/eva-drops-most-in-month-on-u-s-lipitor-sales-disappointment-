Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ,
the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, declined the most in
a month on concern the sales of a cholesterol-lowering pill in
the U.S. are falling short of analysts’ estimates.  The generic version of the Lipitor drug that  Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY)  started selling in the U.S. this month
achieved a market share of 9 percent, according to Wolters
Kluwer. Teva will receive a portion of the profit for the first
six months, under the terms of an agreement between the two
companies. The partnership was expected to capture as much as 20
percent of total sales, according to Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd.
in Tel Aviv.  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) ’s version of the same
drug achieved a 47 percent share, the data showed.  The shares in the Petach-Tikva, Israel-based company
dropped 2.3 percent, the most since Nov. 20, to 159.10 shekels,
or the equivalent of $42.09, at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .
Teva shares traded in the U.S. fell 2.4 percent to $41.71
yesterday. Teva has slid 14 percent in Tel Aviv this year.  “Teva’s weakness reflects investors’ disappointment from a
lower-than-expected market share of the generic Lipitor since
its launch,” said Jonathan Kreizman, an analyst in Tel Aviv at
Clal Finance Brokerage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
