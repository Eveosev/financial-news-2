(Corrects to specify share sale is by Hypo.)  The European Commission approved the
sale of a stake in Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG by Hypo
Niederoesterreich to several private buyers, according to a
statement on the Brussels-based regulator’s website today.  The transaction doesn’t break state aid rules because
“there is no indication that the sale was carried out below
market value,” the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
