Builders broke ground in November on
more houses than at any time in the past 19 months, led by a
surge in multifamily units, signaling the market is stabilizing
heading into 2012.  Starts  increased 9.3 percent to a 685,000 annual rate,
exceeding the  highest estimate  of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News and the most since April 2010, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . Building permits,
a proxy for future construction, also climbed to a more than
one-year high.  Work on multifamily units like apartments and townhouses is
growing as the rental market improves. Single-family-home
construction may be starting to strengthen as lower  home prices 
and borrowing costs near record lows draw in some buyers, even
as builders face competition from existing houses as another
wave of foreclosures throws more marked-down properties on the
market.  “It’s a solid report,” said  Brian Jones , a senior U.S.
economist at  Societe Generale  in New York, who had the highest
forecast in the Bloomberg survey. “For months we’ve been
flagging the strength in multifamily construction, but now we’re
starting to get signs that single-family is pulling itself off
the canvas.”  Shares Climb  Stocks rose as the housing data added to recent evidence
the world’s largest economy is strengthening. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index climbed 3 percent to 1,241.3 at the close in
New York.  Treasury securities  fell, sending the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note up to 1.92 percent from 1.81 percent late
yesterday.  German business confidence unexpectedly rose in December
for a second month as two economic institutes predicted  Europe ’s
biggest economy will stave off the debt crisis and avoid a
recession in 2012, other reports showed today.  Australia ’s central bank said resource investment is also
helping the economy ride out Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. The
 Reserve Bank  of Australia lowered borrowing costs Dec. 6 because
of the “non-trivial possibility of a very sharp contraction”
in Europe, according to minutes of the meeting released today.  Payrolls increased in 29 U.S. states in November, while the
jobless rate declined in 43, a sign the labor market is
recovering across much of the U.S., figures from the Labor
Department also showed today.  New York  led the nation with a
29,500 gain in jobs, followed by Texas with 20,800. The biggest
drop in unemployment was in  Michigan , where the jobless rate
fell 0.8 percentage point to 9.8 percent.  Survey Results  The  median estimate  of 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a gain in U.S. housing starts to a 635,000 rate from
a previously reported 628,000. Projections ranged from 600,000
to 655,000. The Commerce Department revised the October reading
down to 627,000.  The November results compare with last year’s overall tally
of 587,000 starts, the second-fewest on record. Home
construction totaled 554,000 units in 2009, the  lowest  since
record-keeping began in 1959.  Permits  increased to a 681,000 annual pace in November, the
highest level since March 2010. They were projected to fall to a
635,000 rate from 644,000 the prior month, according to the
survey median. Applications for the construction of single-
family homes climbed 1.6 percent, and those for multifamily
units jumped 14 percent.  Single-Family Houses  New construction of single-family houses rose 2.3 percent
from the prior month to a 447,000 annual rate, the most since
June. The category is heading for a record low this year at
around 423,000, about 10 percent less than in 2010, according to
Bloomberg News calculations. The worst year so far in five
decades of data was 2009, when 445,100 homes were started.  The industry is being buoyed by work on  multifamily units ,
which surged 25 percent in November to an annual rate of
238,000, the highest level since September 2008. Apartments and
other multifamily dwellings are gaining ground as foreclosures
turn more Americans into renters.  “Multifamily construction is experiencing a mini boom as
Americans shift from buying to renting,” said  Ryan Sweet , a
senior economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in  West Chester ,
 Pennsylvania . “Homebuilders still compete with a glut of
cheaply priced foreclosed homes, but their own inventory is
nearing historic norms in relation to sales.”  Regional Breakdown  Three of four regions had a November increase in starts,
led by a 54 percent jump in the Northeast and a 23 percent gain
in the West. Starts fell 18 percent in the Midwest.  Purchases of new houses rose 1.3 percent in October, as
discounted prices lured in some buyers, Commerce Department
figures show. Sales of previously owned homes, which now make up
about 94 percent of the market, increased 1.4 percent that same
month, according to the National Association of Realtors.  The Obama administration this month started a new version
of the federal Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, after
the original program helped less than a quarter of the people
targeted to lock in lower  mortgage rates .  Federal Reserve policy makers reiterated at a meeting this
month that they will keep the benchmark  interest rate  near zero
until at least 2013. The central bank in September decided to
reinvest maturing housing debt into new mortgage-backed
securities instead of Treasuries.  Some policy efforts may be contributing to signs of
improvement in the housing market. A report yesterday showed the
National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo  index  of
builder confidence rose in December for a third straight month,
to 21, the highest level since May 2010. Readings below 50 mean
more respondents said conditions were poor.  “November is a time that historically sales slow down,”
 Larry Sorsby , chief financial officer at  Hovnanian Enterprises
Inc. (HOV) , said in a Dec. 15 call with analysts. “And this year
we’ve not seen as dramatic a slowdown as we have in recent prior
years. The market feels a little bit better than we would have
expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
