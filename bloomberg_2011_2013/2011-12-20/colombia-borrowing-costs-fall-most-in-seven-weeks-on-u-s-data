Colombia’s benchmark borrowing costs
in dollars fell the most in seven weeks after a report that
showed U.S. housing starts rose to the highest level in a year
boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Colombian
 government bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 16 basis
points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 185 at 3:15 p.m. Bogota
time, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. It was the biggest drop
since Oct. 27.  U.S. housing starts increased 9.3 percent to a 685,000
annual rate, exceeding the highest estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, Commerce Department figures showed
today in  Washington , a sign the market is stabilizing heading
into 2012. A separate report today showing German business
confidence unexpectedly rose for a second month in December also
helped buoy demand for riskier assets.  “The positive external context” is helping risk appetite
today, said Francisco Chaves, a fixed-income analyst at
brokerage Corredores Asociados in Bogota.  Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing yields on benchmark
securities higher for a second day, amid low trading volumes
before year-end holidays.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.61 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.093
centavo to 118.844 centavos per peso.  “There’s very little trading” which will likely keep
yields between 7.54 percent and 7.63 percent through the
remainder of the year, Chaves said.  The peso erased earlier gains, closing little changed at
1,934.25 per  U.S. dollar , from 1,935.10 yesterday. It has
slipped 1 percent in the last month.  Increased dollar holdings at Colombian banks this year have
helped the peso avoid the steep declines it posted at the end of
2010, according to Chaves. The central bank’s daily dollar
purchases last year depleted cash holdings of the U.S. currency
in local banks, pushing the peso to plunge to a seven-month low
of 2,027.5 on Dec. 28, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
