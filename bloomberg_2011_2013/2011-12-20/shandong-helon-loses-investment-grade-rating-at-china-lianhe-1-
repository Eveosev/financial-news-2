Shandong Helon Co. (000677)  lost its
investment-grade  credit rating  from China Lianhe Credit Rating
Co., one of the nation’s largest credit rating companies.  Lianhe cut its assessment for the maker of fiber and yarns
to BB+, its highest non-investment ranking, by four steps from
A-, the rating company said in a statement yesterday. It
maintained its negative outlook on the company.  The rating company cited continued deterioration in
Shandong Helon’s financial situation, and said the chance it
will default is rising.  Beijing-based Lianhe also cut its rating on the company’s
400 million-yuan, 5.8 percent bond to non-investment grade B
from A-2, according to the statement. The yield on the company’s
bond due in 2012 has risen 12.5 basis points to 9.215 percent
this month, according to Chinabond, the nation’s clearinghouse.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
