Competition in Britain’s local bus
market has “stagnated” and service should be improved with
measures including multi-operator ticketing systems, the U.K.
antitrust regulator said.  Five of the 1,245 bus companies in the U.K. carry more than
70 percent of the passengers, the  Competition Commission  said in
a report today. They are  Stagecoach Group Plc (SGC) ,  National Express
Group Plc (NEX) ,  FirstGroup Plc (FGP) ,  Go-Ahead Group Plc (GOG)  and Deutsche Bahn
AG’s Arriva unit.  “In too many areas of the country, competition has
stagnated and the incumbent providers know that they face
little in the way of a serious challenge,” Jeremy Peat,
chairman of the local bus market investigation group, said
in a statement.  Many bus operators have “little or no competition,”
resulting in less frequent service and in some cases, higher
fares than would be paid if there were more rivalry, the
regulator said. “What we want to do is open these markets up to
sustained competition,” Peat said.  The regulator recommends introducing restrictions on
incumbent operators “over busing” routes to discourage new
entrants, and ensuring that competitors get access to bus
stations managed by other companies on fair terms.  The regulator also called for changes in how local
governments handle bids for contracts and “close scrutiny of
bus mergers” by the  Office of Fair Trading . The OFT referred
the bus market issue to the antitrust regulator in January 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
