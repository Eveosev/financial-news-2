Russian farmers reaped record crops
of oilseeds this year, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  They gathered all-time high harvests of 1.5 million metric
tons of soybeans, 1.1 million tons of rapeseeds and 8 million
tons of sunflower seeds after drying and cleaning, the ministry
said today in a statement on its website, without providing a
total for all oilseeds.  Last year’s oilseed crop reached almost 7.5 million tons,
according to the Federal State Statistics Service. Farmers
reaped 1.2 million tons of soybeans in 2010, about 670,080 tons
of rapeseeds and 5.3 million tons of sunflower seeds, according
to the service.  The country’s harvest of grains and pulses was 92 million
tons, or 51 percent more than last year, the ministry said,
sufficient to meet domestic needs and export 25 million tons in
2011-12.  Russia ’s worst drought in a half century parched fields
in 2010, prompting the government to impose a temporary ban on
exports.  The sugar beet harvest reached a record 45 million tons,
the ministry said. The corn crop reached 6 million tons.  Winter grain sowing exceeded 16 million hectares (39.5
million acres), according to the ministry. Farmers have 6
million tons of seeds, enough for the spring sowing campaign,
the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
