The U.S. Interior Department
approved plans from  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  and  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  to
build renewable-energy projects on public lands.  NextEra’s 300-megawatt  Sonoran Solar Energy Project ,
located in Maricopa County, is the first solar project to be
built on public lands in Arizona, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar
said on a media conference call today. It may cost about $1
billion, Steven Stengel, a spokesman for Juno Beach, Florida-
based NextEra, said in an e-mail.  NextEra switched the original design of the plant to use
lower-cost conventional solar panels instead of parabolic trough
solar-thermal equipment. It’s still seeking a buyer for its
power output, Stengel said.  Iberdrola’s  Tule Wind Project , located 70 miles (113
kilometers) east of  San Diego , will include 68 turbines with 186
megawatts of capacity on public lands. Its total capacity may
reach 200 megawatts including other segments proposed on private
and Native American lands, according to Iberdrola Renewables, a
U.S. subsidiary of the Spanish company.  Tule may cost more than $400 million, Jan Johnson, an
Iberdrola spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. A turbine
supplier hasn’t been selected, and there’s no power purchaser
yet, she said. Additional state and federal approvals are needed
before construction can begin.  The Interior Department oversees about one in every five
acres of land in the U.S., according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
