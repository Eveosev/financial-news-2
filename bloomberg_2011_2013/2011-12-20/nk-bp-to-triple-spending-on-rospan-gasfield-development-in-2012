TNK-BP , BP Plc’s Russian venture
with a group of billionaires, will triple investment in a
natural-gas development next year as it gains transit capacity.  TNK-BP plans to spend $250 million tapping the Achim layer
at its Rospan International unit’s Urengoi field next year after
spending $66 million there this year, the Moscow-based company
said today in a statement on its  website .  TNK-BP said last year that it plans to increase Rospan’s
production five-fold to more than 16 billion cubic meters a year
after reaching an agreement on space in the pipeline network,
which belongs to OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s largest natural-gas
producer and the export monopoly.  Rospan sold 1.6 billion cubic meters of gas in the first
half of this year, according to a July 26 presentation by TNK-
BP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
