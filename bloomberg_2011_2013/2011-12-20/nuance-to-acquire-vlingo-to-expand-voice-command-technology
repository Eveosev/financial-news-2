Nuance Communications Inc. (NUAN)  agreed to
buy Vlingo Inc. in a deal that gives the developer of voice-
command technology a system that can respond to spoken words
with actions such as Internet searches.  Terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed in a statement
today from Nuance, based in Burlington, Massachusetts, and
Vlingo, a closely held company backed by Charles River Ventures
Inc., Sigma Partners LP,  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  and  AT&T Inc. (T)   The companies are combining after fighting legal battles
over patent claims. The purchase will help capture rising demand
for voice-command technology, which is being driven by devices
such as Apple Inc.’s Siri, Nuance said.  “Our companies are stronger together than alone,” Dave Grannan, chief executive officer of Cambridge, Massachusetts-
based Vlingo, said in the statement.  Nuance rose 7 percent to $25.63 at 4 p.m. New York time,
for the shares’ biggest gain since Oct. 6. They have advanced
41 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
