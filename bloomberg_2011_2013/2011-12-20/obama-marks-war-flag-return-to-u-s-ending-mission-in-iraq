President  Barack Obama  marked the
end of the war in Iraq with a special military ceremony,
signifying the end of a mission, at Joint Base Andrews outside
Washington.  The president, joined by Vice President Joe Biden, Deputy
Defense Secretary  Ashton Carter  and the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Army General Martin Dempsey, celebrated the
return of the military flag that flew over Baghdad, the Iraqi
capital.  Army Command Sergeant Major Joseph R. Allen, accompanied by
29 members of the Army, the Navy and the  Air Force , carried the
white and gold flag down the steps of an Air Force plane. They
were greeted by Obama and Biden.  The last U.S. combat troops rolled out of  Iraq  on Dec. 18,
ending almost nine years of war.  “I’m proud to finally say these two words: Welcome home,”
Obama told soldiers at a Dec. 14 ceremony at Fort Bragg, North
Carolina. He called the end of the war “an extraordinary
achievement” and told the troops that “we remember everything
that you did to make it possible.”  Almost 4,500 U.S. personnel were killed and about 32,000
were wounded in the conflict. The war cost the U.S. more than
$800 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
