OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) ,
the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , gained
for the first time in more than a week as investors recovered
from the company’s most recent production delay.  OGX rose 4.9 percent to 13.39 reais at 4:07 p.m. in Sao
Paulo trading, the most of any member of Brazil’s benchmark
Bovespa index. Earlier the stock climbed as much as 5.6 percent
to 13.49 reais. OGX dropped 13 percent in the previous six
trading sessions.  OGX said Dec. 14 that it was postponing production until
January 2012. The company, based in Rio de Janeiro, hasn’t yet
produced oil and delayed starting production at the offshore
Waimea field several times this year.  “The share suffered a lot in the last few days because of
the company’s delay in starting commercial production,” Luiz
Broad, an analyst at Agora CTVM SA brokerage, said in a
telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro  today. “It’s a natural
rebound.”  OGX has dropped 33 percent so far this year, more than the
19 percent decline in the Bovespa index.  The company has a long-term production target of 750,000
barrels a day in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
