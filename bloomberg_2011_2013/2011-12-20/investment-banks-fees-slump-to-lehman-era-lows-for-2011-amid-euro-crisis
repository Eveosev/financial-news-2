Investment banks’ fees are on course
to match the levels of 2008, when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
collapsed, after  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis roiled global
markets and companies shelved deal plans.  The global  investment banking  fee pool, which comprises
payments to banks for mergers and acquisitions advice, loans and
underwriting debt and equity sales, may post the worst quarter
since 2004 and stood at $78.6 billion year-to-date as of Dec.
19, according to New York-based research firm Freeman & Co.
That’s 9 percent less than the $86.4 billion earned in 2011 and
little more than the $78.5 billion earned in 2008.  “Fee generation over the past few months has been muted
and the outlook for next year will be hugely impacted by a
resolution of the euro-zone issue,” said Patrick Meier, head of
European investment banking at  RBC Capital Markets (RY)  in  London .
“If that happens, I would expect financing markets to return to
some semblance of normality, although it may take time to get
back to the fervor of recent years.”  Investment banks have struggled to recover since the
banking crisis of 2008 morphed into a sovereign debt crisis last
year. Their corporate clients have opted to preserve cash rather
than spend it on acquisitions, while volatile markets have made
it difficult for companies to sell shares and bonds.  Global fee income had increased every year from 2002’s
$49.6 billion in 2002 through the 2007 peak of $114.6 billion,
according to Freeman & Co.  Fees from the Americas were $42 billion as of Dec. 19,
about 5.6 percent less than last year’s level. The Asia-Pacific
region yielded fees of $15.9 billion, 20 percent less than the
previous year. Fees from Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa
stood at $20.7 billion on Dec. 19, or 7 percent short of the
full-year number for 2010.  “The missing ingredient is confidence, both on the part of
investors and corporates themselves,” Meier at  RBC Capital
Markets  said. “There is increasing concern that events in the
market will feed through to the real economy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
