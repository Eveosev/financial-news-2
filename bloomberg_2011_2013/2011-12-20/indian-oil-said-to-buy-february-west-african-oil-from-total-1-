Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s
largest refiner, bought 2 million barrels of West African crude
from  Total SA (FP)  for loading in February via a tender, according to
four traders who participate in the market.  The company bought one cargo each of Angolan Hungo and
Nigerian Akpo blends, said the people, who declined to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak on the
matter. It separately purchased 600,000 barrels of Nigerian
crude also for February from another seller, they said.  Earlier this month, Indian Oil bought 4 million barrels of
crude for February loading, including Angolan Girassol and
Nigerian Qua Iboe from Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and Nigerian
Forcados and Bonga from Glencore International Plc.  Details of the purchases are as follows:  To contact the reporters on this story:
