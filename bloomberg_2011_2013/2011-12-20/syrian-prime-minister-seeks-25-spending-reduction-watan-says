Syrian Prime Minister Adel Safar
issued a circular instructing public authorities to reduce
expenditure set out in the 2012 budget by 25 percent,  Al Watan 
reported.  The reductions are related to spending on gasoline and
diesel fuel, stationery, newspaper and magazine subscriptions,
overtime pay, bonuses, transportation, advertising and public
relations expenses, the Damascus-based newspaper said. The
measures are part of government efforts to cut waste,
rationalize public spending and be more efficient, it reported.  Syria â€™s parliament approved on Dec. 15 a 2012 budget that
includes government expenditure of 1.33 trillion pounds
($25 billion), 59 percent more than this year, the official
 Syrian Arab News Agency  reported. Details of the budget were
disclosed Sept. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
