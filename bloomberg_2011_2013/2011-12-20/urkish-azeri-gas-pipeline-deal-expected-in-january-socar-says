Turkish and Azeri energy officials
aim to finish an agreement by January on a new pipeline to ship
natural gas from the  BP Plc -operated Shah Deniz field to  Europe 
via  Turkey , an Azeri energy official said today.  “Any company that has gas” can join the venture to build
a pipe from Turkey’s eastern border to the west, said Rovnaq Abdullayev, president of State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , or Socar.
Many members of Shah Deniz have shown interest, he said in an
interview in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi.  The Trans-Anatolian pipeline, which may cost $6 billion to
$7 billion and have a capacity of 21 billion cubic meters a
year, is planned to be completed by 2017 when the second phase
of Shah Deniz starts producing gas, the state-owned Anatolia
News Agency said last month, citing Socar Vice President Vaqif
Aliyev. The project seems more “do-able” than the European
Union-backed Nabucco pipeline, he was quoted as saying.  The Shah Deniz group is looking at Nabucco “seriously”
and questions still remain on the project, Abdullayev said. The
group will opt for less expensive transit options, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
