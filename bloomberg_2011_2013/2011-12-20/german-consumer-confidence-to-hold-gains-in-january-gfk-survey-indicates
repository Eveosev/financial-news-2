German  consumer confidence  will hold
its gains in January as falling unemployment boosts the economic
outlook even as Europe’s debt crisis worsens,  GfK SE (GFK)  said.  The Nuremberg-based market research company forecast today
that its consumer-sentiment index, based on a survey of about
2,000 people, will remain at 5.6 next month after three straight
increases. Economists forecast a decline to 5.5, according to
the median of 22 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Unemployment in Europe’s largest economy is at a two-decade
low of 6.9 percent, supporting  consumer spending  and helping to
limit the impact of the euro-region turmoil.  Business confidence 
unexpectedly rose for the first time in five months in November.
GfK said its measure of households’ economic expectations
increased for the first time since July.  “Despite rising economic risks and further escalation of
the debt crisis, Germans are once again more optimistic about
the future,” it said. “With most German companies operating at
above-average capacity, the labor market is very robust and
unemployment figures continue to fall.”  GfK’s gauge of economic optimism rose to minus 0.9 in
December from minus 7.2 in November, and an index of income
expectations increased to 34 from 31.1. While a measure of
consumers’ willingness to spend slumped to 27.4 from 40.3, GfK
said it is “still at a comparatively high level.”  TUI AG , the German owner of  Europe ’s largest travel
company, said Dec. 14 it expects “moderate growth” next year
even as the European economy remains difficult. Pretax profit in
the 12 months through September rose to 206.8 million euros
($269 million) from 177.8 million euros a year earlier, the
Hanover-based company said.  The Bundesbank predicted yesterday that German economic
growth will slow to 0.6 percent in 2012 from 3 percent this year
before improving to 1.8 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
