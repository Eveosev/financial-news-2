Russian stocks (INDEXCF)  fell for a second day
as protesters plan further demonstrations this weekend against
the parliamentary election results and falling oil prices hurt
the energy-led economy.  The 30-stock Micex Index declined 0.7 percent to 1,373.26
by 12:09 p.m. in Moscow. Oil producer OAO Gazprom Neft slid 1.2
percent OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest lender, lost 0.6 percent
while coal-maker OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  dropped 1.5 percent. The dollar-
denominated  RTS Index  retreated 0.7 percent to 1,360.81.  Almost 40,000 people have signed-up to protest on Dec. 24
in Central Moscow against alleged ballot-box stuffing in Dec. 4
elections. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, dropped 0.1
percent yesterday to $104.73. Crude for January delivery climbed
30 cents to 94.58 a barrel in  New York , paring this month’s
decline to 5.5 percent. Stocks have plunged 8.2 percent this
month following the nationwide protests.  “Russia is in the doldrums,” Julian Rimmer, a trader of
Russian shares at CF Global Trading in  London , wrote in e-mailed
comments. “Investor attention is fading and the world is
watching to see how Russia’s inchoate protest movement fares
this weekend.”  Russia’s newly merged Micex-RTS exchange halted equity
futures trading on its first day yesterday, sparking concern the
Moscow bourse won’t be able to compete with global peers.  Futures Trading  Futures expiring in March on the dollar-denominated RTS
index stopped trading about 12 minutes into the U.S. session
yesterday due to a “technical problem,” Anton Storozh, a
technical support specialist at the exchange said by phone from
Moscow. Trading resumed 50 minutes before the end of the
session, with the contracts sliding 1 percent to 133,350.  The world’s 10th biggest futures market, according to the
Futures Industry Association, became part of Russia’s newly
combined exchange yesterday after the Micex and  RTS  united in a
bid to lure local companies and investors back to their home
market. After halting trading more than 30 times in the second
half of 2008, the Micex cut the number of stoppages to once in
2009 and five this year, according to spokesman Nikita Bekasov.  “It’s not a good start,”  Luis Saenz , chief executive
officer of the U.S. unit of Moscow-based brokerage Otkritie
Financial Corp., said by phone from New York. “Investors have
been complaining, wondering if this is what they should expect
going forward, especially in this environment when there is
already so much happening in Russia politically and otherwise.”  Otkritie handles about 38 percent of futures and options
trading on the RTS, according to Saenz.  The Micex lost 18 percent this year and trades at 4.7 times
estimated earnings, the cheapest valuation among major  emerging
markets . That compares with 10 times for  Brazil ’s Bovespa index,
10.6 for the Shanghai Composite Index and 13.7 in the case of
the BSE India Sensitive Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
