Stocks rallied, with the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rebounding from its lowest level of the month,
and Treasuries fell as U.S. housing starts topped economists’
estimates and German business confidence unexpectedly grew.  The  S&P 500  surged 3 percent to close at 1,241.29 at 4 p.m.
in  New York  and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  jumped 337.17
points, or 2.9 percent, to 12,103.43, the biggest gains since
Nov. 30 for both. Spain’s government bonds stayed higher as the
nation sold 5.64 billion euros ($7.4 billion) of Treasury bills.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note advanced 11 basis
points to 1.92 percent, with the dollar weakening versus all 16
of its most-traded peers. Oil gained 3.6 percent and the GSCI
index of 24 commodities climbed for a second day.  U.S. builders broke ground in November on the most houses
in over a year, a sign that the market is stabilizing heading
into 2012. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker  predicted the  U.S. economy  will grow at least 2 percent
next year. German business confidence unexpectedly rose for a
second month in December, according to the Ifo institute.  “It looks like our economy is doing pretty good despite
the challenges of  Europe ,” said  Michael Strauss , who helps
oversee about $27 billion of assets as chief investment
strategist at Commonfund in Wilton,  Connecticut . “We’re seeing
better economic news and the housing report fits right in line
with that. The data provides confirmation that the surprise may
be that housing is a pretty good contributor to economic
activity. It’s another piece of news that’s helping the stock
market.”  Housing Starts  The S&P 500 rebounded after yesterday’s 1.2 percent loss.
The index, which has fluctuated between gains and losses for
2011 since the end of October, trimmed its year-to-day decline
to 1.3 percent.  Standard Pacific Corp. and PulteGroup Inc. surged more than
9 percent to help lead a rally in homebuilders. Housing  starts 
grew 9.3 percent to a 685,000 annual rate, exceeding the highest
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the
highest level since April 2010, Commerce Department figures
showed. Building permits, a proxy for future construction, also
climbed to a more than one-year high.  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  rallied 22 percent, its biggest gain
in three years, after the investment bank battling speculation
about its financial strength reported earnings that topped
analysts’ estimates on a recovery in fixed-income trading.  About 14 shares advanced for every one that declined in the
Stoxx 600. UniCredit SpA, BNP Paribas SA and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA
all climbed more than 5 percent to pace a rally in banks. Arkema
SA climbed 9.1 percent amid speculation the company may be a
takeover target. Bayer AG added 5 percent after the drugmaker
said four of its drugs in development may become blockbusters.  The German Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 107.2 from 106.6 in
November, the Munich-based institute said. Economists had
expected a drop to 106, the median forecast of 36 economists in
a Bloomberg survey showed.  Treasury Auction  The five-year Treasury note yield increased five basis
points to 0.86 percent. The U.S. sold $35 billion of five-year
notes at a record low yield of 0.880 percent, compared with a
forecast of 0.885 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of debt offered, was 2.86, versus an average 2.85 at the
past 10 sales. The U.S. drew record low yields last week at
sales of 30-year bonds and five-year inflation-linked notes.  The yield on  Germany ’s 10-year bund rose seven basis points
to 1.96 percent, while similar-maturity Italian yields slid 22
basis points to 6.61 percent.  Spain’s 10-year bond yields were 11 basis points lower at
5.07 percent and two-year note yields were two basis points
lower at 3.35 percent. The nation sold 5.64 billion euros of
three-month and six-month bills, the Bank of  Spain  said,
compared with a maximum target of 4.5 billion euros the Treasury
had set for the sale.  Commodities  Oil for January delivery climbed 3.6 percent to $97.22 a
barrel as the U.S. housing data bolstered optimism in the
economy and speculation grew that further sanctions against  Iran 
will curb supply. The GSCI index jumped 2.5 percent, as  Brent
crude , heating oil, cocoa, aluminum and gasoline climbed more
than 2 percent.  The euro strengthened 0.6 percent to $1.3079.  Australia ’s
dollar climbed 1.8 percent against the dollar after minutes of
the central bank’s last meeting showed policy makers saw a
continued expansion in the domestic economy even as Europe’s
debt crisis weighs on global economic growth.  Sweden’s krona appreciated against the dollar and the euro
even as the nation’s central bank lowered its main rate for the
first time since 2009 to protect the economy from the debt
crisis.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  rose 1.4 percent,
rebounding from its lowest level since Nov. 25. The Kospi Index
climbed 0.9 percent in  Seoul , rebounding from a 3.4 percent
slide yesterday, and the won strengthened 1.7 percent against
the dollar.  South Korea ’s National Pension Service, the nation’s
biggest investor, said it bought stocks yesterday after the
death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il spurred some investors
to sell on concern the leadership transition may lead to
conflict on the peninsula. Moody’s Investors Service and S&P
said Kim Jong Il’s death is unlikely to affect South Korea’s
credit rating.  To contact the reporters on this story:
