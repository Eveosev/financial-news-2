Spanish  government notes  rose for an
eighth day and Italian bonds gained as the  European Central Bank 
offered unlimited three-year loans to the region’s banks,
boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  German  10-year yields advanced  as a report showed business
confidence in Europe’s largest economy unexpectedly rose in
December. Italian two-year note yields fell for a fourth day,
touching a seven-week low, on speculation banks bought the
nation’s debt to use as collateral at the ECB’s long-term
refinancing operation. Spain sold more than its maximum target
of bills today as borrowing costs fell.  Greece  issued 1 billion
euros ($1.3 billion) of 91-day securities.  The ECB’s longer-term refinancing operation “appears to
have spurred demand for short-dated Spanish and Italian paper,”
said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “There’s been a
bit of a grab of collateral as investors set up for it. The
market has been pricing in the operation since before the ECB
meeting. This has boosted both core markets and the periphery.”  Italian two-year note yields dropped 20 basis points, or
0.2 percentage point, to 4.94 percent at 3:47 p.m. London time,
after reaching 4.91 percent, the  least  since Oct. 31. The 2.25
percent security due in November 2013 rose 0.33, or 3.3 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 95.385. Italy’s 10-year bond
yield fell 27 basis points to 6.57 percent.  Spain’s two-year note yields slid three basis points to
3.34 percent.  ECB Loans  Italian and Spanish two-year rates have slipped more than
one percentage point since ECB President  Mario Draghi  announced
the unprecedented loans on Dec. 8, as investors bet that banks
may use the cash to buy government debt.  The three-year loan operation takes place today and the
results will be announced tomorrow. Economists expect the ECB to
lend 293 billion euros to banks in tomorrow’s tender, according
to the median of 14 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey
conducted before today’s allotments.  Lenders may have taken as much as 550 billion euros, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc analysts, including Ian Smillie,
wrote in a report dated yesterday. ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio yesterday predicted “significant” demand for the
loans.  Spain’s  10-year  bonds rose for a sixth day, pushing the
yield down 11 basis points to 5.07 percent, the least since Oct.
12.  Business Climate  The nation’s central bank regulators met with treasurers on
Dec. 15 to encourage them to use the ECB’s new facility, telling
them that the more banks use the facility, the less chance there
is of stigma for taking the funds, said two people familiar with
a meeting held last week. A spokesman for the Bank of  Spain 
declined to comment in an emailed response.  Ten-year bund yields rose eight basis points to 1.96
percent. Two-year note yields were little changed at 0.21
percent, after dropping to 0.202 percent, the  lowest  since at
least 1990 when Bloomberg began collecting the data.  The Ifo institute’s business climate  index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, rose to 107.2 from 106.6 in
November, the Munich-based institute said today. Economists
expected a drop to 106, the median forecast of 36 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey showed.  German two-year note yields have fallen 65 basis points
this year, while 10-year rates have dropped more than 1
percentage point as the euro-area’s sovereign-debt crisis
worsened, stoking demand for the region’s benchmark securities.  Spanish Sale  The Bundesbank forecast yesterday that German economic
growth will slow to 0.6 percent in 2012 from 3 percent this
year, before recovering to 1.8 percent in 2013.  Spain sold 5.64 billion euros of three- and six-month
bills, the central bank said, compared with a maximum target of
4.5 billion euros the Treasury had set for the sale.  The average yield on the three-month debt dropped to 1.735
percent, compared with 5.110 percent when the securities were
last issued on Nov. 22, and the average six-month yield fell to
2.435 percent from 5.227 percent last month.  Europe  bolstered its anti-crisis arsenal yesterday,
channeling 150 billion euros to the  International Monetary Fund .  Four countries not using the single currency also pledged
to add to the IMF war chest, while Britain refused to commit,
preventing officials from reaching the 200 billion-euro target
to ease the euro area’s home-grown debt burdens. The U.K. will
“define its contribution” in early 2012, euro finance
ministers said in a statement after a conference call yesterday.  German bonds have handed investors 2.8 percent this month,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, boosting year-to-
date returns to 9.4 percent. Spanish securities have gained 6.1
percent this year, while Greek debt has lost more than 63
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
