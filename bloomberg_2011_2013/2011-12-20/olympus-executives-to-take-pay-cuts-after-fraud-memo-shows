Olympus Corp. executives will take
pay cuts starting this month after the Japanese camera maker
restated earnings, wiping out 70 percent of its net assets,
because of an accounting fraud that lasted more than a decade.  President Shuichi Takayama’s salary will be reduced by 50
percent, while executive vice presidents, senior executive
managing officers and executive managing officers will take a 40
percent cut, according to an internal company memo, a copy of
which was given to Bloomberg News. Executive officers will take
a 30 percent reduction.  The cuts will continue for the “foreseeable future,”
according to the memo.  Tsuyoshi Kitada, a spokesman at Olympus, declined to
comment on the memo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
