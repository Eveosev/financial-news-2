French farm income is expected to
fall 2.3 percent this year, weighed down by higher costs for
fertilizer and animal feed, the  Agriculture Ministry  reported.  Average pretax operating income per farmer this year is
estimated at 30,200 euros ($39,526) from 30,900 euros in 2010,
the ministry’s statistical department Agreste said in an e-
mailed report today.  France  is the European Union’s largest agricultural
producer, with farm output of 66.7 billion euros at basic
prices, or 19 percent of the 27-nation bloc’s production,
according to the EU’s statistical agency Eurostat.  “Despite prices holding up well and business being
vigorous, the rise of production costs penalizes the revenue of
plant producers as well as animal producers,” Agreste wrote in
the report.  Earnings for producers of commodity crops including grains,
oilseeds and sugar beets are forecast to slump 22 percent to an
average 37,300 euros per farmer from 47,700 euros, the
statistics department said.  “Other than the cost of fertilizer and energy, the drop in
revenue is a result of the yield decline for most of the cereals
following the drought in the spring of 2011,” Agreste wrote.
“However, corn production progresses, helped by the summer
rains.”  Vineyard income is estimated to climb to 55,100 euros this
year from 36,400 euros in 2010, helped by a bigger grape harvest
and rising wine prices on the back of increased exports,
according to the ministry’s statistics service.  Dairy Cows  The average holder of dairy cows will see pretax earnings
climb to 30,300 euros from 25,800 euros, while earnings for
beef-cattle producers are estimated at 13,700 euros from 15,600
euros, the report showed.  “The cost of  animal feed , even if stabilized at the end of
the year, hurts the revenue,” Agreste said. “It’s compensated
by a favorable price evolution in dairy-cattle and poultry
breeding.”  Pig-farmer income will fall to an average 26,500 euros from
35,600 euros, while earnings for poultry breeders are estimated
to have climbed to an average 32,100 euros in 2011 from 30,500
euros, according to the report.  Vegetable and mushroom growers will see their income slide
to an average 10,400 euros per farmer from 31,000 euros in 2010,
according to the data. The industry suffered from the effects of
the E. coli outbreak in  Germany , which prompted an 11 percent
slump in vegetable prices, Agreste said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
