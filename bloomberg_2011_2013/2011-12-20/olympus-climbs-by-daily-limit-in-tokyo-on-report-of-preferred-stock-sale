Olympus Corp. (7733)  rose as much as 16
percent, the maximum daily limit, after a report that the
company may raise 100 billion yen ($1.28 billion) by selling
preference shares to shore up its balance sheet.  The Japanese camera maker has hired financial advisers for
a plan to sell preferred stock convertible into common shares,
the Nikkei newspaper reported today, without citing anyone.
Investors may include  Sony Corp. (6758) , Fujifilm Holdings Corp.,
 Panasonic Corp. (6752) , Innovation Network Corp. of Japan and
Germany’s  Siemens AG , the report said. Details of the sale
would be set next month, Nikkei said.  The size of the fundraising would be influenced by the
 Tokyo  Stock Exchange’s decision on whether to delist Olympus
following a $1.7 billion accounting fraud, the paper said.  “A share sale would strengthen Olympus’s financials and
that brings reassurance for investors,” said  Yoshihiro Okumura ,
who helps oversee $365 million at Chiba-Gin Asset Management Co.
in Tokyo. “It was also positive that there are companies
interested in investing in Olympus.”  The stock reversed an earlier 3.8 percent decline to trade
11 percent higher at 1,020 yen as of 10:41 a.m. on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. Olympus, which rose by its 150 yen daily limit,
was the  biggest (NKY)  gainer on Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average, which rose 0.6 percent.  Olympus was not the source of Nikkei report, the company
said in a statement. Spokesmen at Sony, Fujifilm and Panasonic
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
