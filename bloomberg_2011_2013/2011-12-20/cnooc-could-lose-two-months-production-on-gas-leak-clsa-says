Cnooc Ltd. (883)  China’s largest offshore
energy explorer, may idle two natural gas fields for as long as
two months after they were shut yesterday because of a leak in a
subsea pipeline, CLSA Ltd. said.  The outage could lead to gas shortages in the industrial
province of Guangdong if supply from liquefied natural gas
terminals is unable to make up the shortfall, analyst Simon Powell said in a research note e-mailed to clients today.  Cnooc said yesterday that PY30-1 and HZ21-1f fields in
 South China Sea  were shut after the Zhuhai Maritime Safety
Administration notified it of the leak. The Beijing-based
company will lose equilvalent of around 26,700 barrels of oil
daily, or 2.9 percent of its 2011 production target, adding to
the loss of 40,000 barrels a day from the closure in September
of the Penglai field in  Bohai Bay .  “We see lack of production growth as a significant issue
for Cnooc in 2012, and this event is not going to help,” Powell
wrote. “It’s too early to figure out how long the fields will
need to be turned off, but we assume a month or two of lost
production.”  The explorer’s shares fell 0.6 percent to HK$13.50 as of
11:15 a.m. in  Hong Kong . The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 0.4
percent.  The cause of the leak is still under investigation, Cnooc
said yesterday, and it will repair the pipeline to resume
operations at the terminal as soon as possible. No one was hurt
and there was no environmental damage, according to the
statement. Vessels near the leak were evacuated.  Cnooc reduced its output target to 331 million to 341
million barrels of oil equivalent from a goal of as much as 365
million after  China  ordered ConocoPhillips, operator of Penglai
sites, to stop production on Sept. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
