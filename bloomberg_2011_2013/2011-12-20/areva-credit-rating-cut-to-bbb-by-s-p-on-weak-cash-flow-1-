Areva SA, the French maker of
nuclear reactors, had its long-term credit  rating  cut two levels
by  Standard & Poor’s , which cited expected weak credit metrics
and free  cash flow  for 2012 as nuclear demand slowed following
the atomic accident in  Japan  in March.  Areva’s long- and short-term ratings were cut to BBB-/A-3
from BBB+/A-2, the ratings company said in a statement today.
The outlook is stable.  “We expect credit metrics and free cash flow to remain
very weak in 2012, with a substantial recovery only in 2014, two
years later than we previously assumed,” the ratings company
said.  Areva SA  said last week it plans to  cut costs  by 1 billion
euros ($1.31 billion) by 2015, and to sell at least 1.2 billion
euros of financial, mining and other assets by the end of 2013
to shore up its finances which have been hurt by construction
delays at a plant in  Finland , a slowdown in demand for nuclear
fuel and services, and writedowns on mines and other assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
