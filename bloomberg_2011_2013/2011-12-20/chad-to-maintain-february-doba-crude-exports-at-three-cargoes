Chad  will export three cargoes of
Doba crude in February, unchanged from next month, according to
a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Each shipment will be 950,000 barrels, the plan showed.
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  operates the Doba field.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
