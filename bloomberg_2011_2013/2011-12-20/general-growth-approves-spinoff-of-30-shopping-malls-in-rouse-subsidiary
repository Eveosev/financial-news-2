General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , the
second-biggest U.S. mall owner, said its board approved the
spinoff of its Rouse Properties Inc. subsidiary, to consist of
30 regional shopping centers in 19 states.  The separation will be completed through a pro rata taxable
dividend on Jan. 12, to stockholders of record as of the close
of U.S. exchanges on Dec. 30, Chicago-based General Growth said
today in a statement.  Under the plan, General Growth stockholders will receive
about 0.0375 shares of Rouse Properties common stock, the real
estate investment trust said. Rouse should have about 35.5
million common shares following the spinoff.  General Growth, which left  bankruptcy protection  last year,
has been refinancing debt and selling properties, including
 Boston â€™s Faneuil Hall Marketplace, to boost growth. The REIT,
second to  Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG)  in size, has stakes in 167
malls in 42 states totaling 169 million square feet (15.7 square
meters).  If conditions of the spinoff are not satisfied by the
distribution date, General Growth will instead pay a special
cash dividend on Jan. 17 to stockholders of record as of Dec.
30, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
