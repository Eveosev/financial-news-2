Dubai shares dropped to the lowest
level in three weeks, led by  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)  amid investor
speculation that this month’s gain for the  United Arab Emirates ’
biggest construction company may have been overdone.  Arabtec tumbled the most since Aug. 7. Emirates NBD PJSC,
the country’s biggest bank by assets, declined the most since
Nov. 1. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  retreated 1 percent to
1,360.80, the lowest since Nov. 27, at the 2 p.m. close in the
emirate. The measure has retreated 17 percent this year. The
Bloomberg GCC 200 Index, which tracks the biggest 200 companies
in the region, gained 0.1 percent.  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI) 
fell 0.8 percent.  “Profit taking on Arabtec by the end of the session
brought the index down,” said Samer Darwiche, an analyst at
Gulfmena Investments in Dubai.  Arabtec has surged 13 percent this month compared with a
decline of 1.3 percent for Dubai’s benchmark index. The shares
trade at about 13 times estimated earnings, while  Emaar
Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the world’s tallest tower, is
valued at 8.4 times. Arabtec said Nov. 30 that the value of a
contract it won in Saudi Arabia may rise to 1.5 billion riyals
($400 million) as it expands in the biggest Arab market.  The shares tumbled 5.2 percent to 1.65 dirhams as about
29.5 million were traded, the highest volume on Dubai’s index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Arabtec has been outperforming aggressively lately so
this correction is very expected, and is even softer than the
rally,” said Chahir Hosni, equity sales manager at EFG-Hermes
Holding SAE in Dubai.  Emirates NBD lost 4.1 percent to 3.05 dirhams. The bank had
its price-estimate cut by HC Brokerage on Dec. 18, citing rising
loan-loss charges and a possible acquisition of mortgage lender
 Amlak Finance PJSC .  Kuwait’s benchmark gained 0.2 percent and Qatar’s QE Index
advanced 0.4 percent, while Bahrain’s BB All Share Index dropped
1.3 percent. Oman’s MSM30 Index fell 0.7 percent.  Saudi Arabia ’s
Tadawul All Share Index rose 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
