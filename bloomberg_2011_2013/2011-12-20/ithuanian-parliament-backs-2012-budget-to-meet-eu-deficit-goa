Lithuania’s Parliament  gave its
final approval to the 2012 state budget, trimming the deficit to
within the European Union’s limit.  Lawmakers voted 72 to 45, with 3 abstentions, in Vilnius
today to pass the budget, a key fiscal measure for assessing a
country’s readiness to adopt the euro, which Lithuania intends
to join in 2014. The budget foresees a deficit of 3 percent of
 gross domestic product , the EU’s limit, after an estimated 5.3
percent shortfall this year.  The Baltic nation, which pushed through one of the European
Union’s toughest austerity measures in 2009 and 2010, must cut
the deficit to the within EU ceiling next year. Economic growth
will probably slow to 2.5 percent in 2012 from 5.8 percent this
year as demand for  Lithuania ’s exports, which account for about
two-thirds of output, wanes in the European markets.  “It’s a difficult but a responsible budget,” Prime
Minister Andrius Kubilius said after the vote. “The deficit is
within 3 percent, which is a big achievement in this
environment.”  Lithuania will implement measures including cuts for
ministries and investment projects and will demand state-owned
companies to divert a portion of their profits to the budget to
plug the shortfall. Parliament also approved new taxes for
luxury real estate.  Lithuania will also reduce the portion of social-security
tax diverted to privately run retirement funds to 1.5 percent
from the current rate of 2 percent. The government had gradually
reduced the transfers to private pensions funds from 5.5 percent
in 2008 to grapple with a ballooning deficit as the economy
contracted 14.8 percent in 2009.  The government must cut the deficit to meet a 2012 deadline
set by the European Commission as the shortfall has breached the
3 percent limit since 2008. Failure to do so may prompt the EU’s
executive arm to impose penalties. The deficit was 7 percent of
GDP in 2010.  The Kubilius-led government implemented austerity measures
equal to 12 percent of GDP through 2009 and 2010 to plug the
widening budget gap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
