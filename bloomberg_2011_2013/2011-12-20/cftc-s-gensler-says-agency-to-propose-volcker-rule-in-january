U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission Chairman  Gary Gensler  said his agency may vote to
propose the so-called Volcker Rule in January, following in the
footsteps of four other federal agencies.  The CFTC is the last of five U.S. financial regulators to
propose the rule, which would curtail banks’ proprietary trading
and limit their relationships with hedge funds. The rule, named
for former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker , is required by
the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.  “I would be hopeful that we would address ourselves to a
proposal -- possibly even in the first meeting of January -- of
the Volcker Rule,” Gensler told reporters at a meeting today in
Washington.  The next CFTC meeting is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 11,
according to CFTC spokesman Steve Adamske.  The Securities and Exchange Commission,  Federal Reserve ,
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. issued a joint 298-page proposal for the
rule on Oct. 11. The agencies are seeking public comment on the
draft and may make changes before it takes effect July 21.  “I would envision that we would move forward with the
proposal consistent with what other regulators have done,”
Gensler told lawmakers at a Dec. 6 hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
