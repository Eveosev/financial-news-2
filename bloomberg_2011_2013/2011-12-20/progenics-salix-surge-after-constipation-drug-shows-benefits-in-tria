Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc. (PGNX) , the
developer of an injected constipation treatment, gained the most
in three years after an oral version of the drug helped patients
in a late-stage trial.  Progenics rose 31 percent to $8.49 at the close of New York
trading, the biggest gain for the Tarrytown, New York-based
company since April 2008.  Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (SLXP) , which
licenses the medication, climbed to its highest price in 11
months.  The drug treats constipation that occurs in people taking
opioid analgesics, prescribed for chronic pain during advanced
illness, the companies said in a statement today. The injected
form of the product is marketed as Relistor. An oral form may
generate revenue of $500 million to $800 million a year, said
Matthew Weiss, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in New York  “This is a big success by all measures,” Weiss said in a
note to investors.  Salix gained 8.6 percent to $46.94. The shares of the
Raleigh, North Carolina-based company are little changed this
year. Progenics has gained 55 percent this year.  The trial, the last of the three phases usually needed for
U.S. approval, tested a once-daily oral dose of the drug,
methylnaltrexone, at doses of 150, 300 and 450 milligrams
compared with a placebo for 84 days. The two higher doses
improved bowel movement within four hours over 28 days of use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
