Kevin William Harpham, a 37-year-old
white supremacist, was sentenced to 32 years in prison for
placing an explosive device near the site of a Martin Luther
King Jr. Day parade in Spokane,  Washington .  Harpham was arrested in March with planting the bomb near a
unity march held on Jan. 17, the U.S.  Justice Department  said
today in an e-mailed statement. The device didn’t explode and no
one was hurt.  In September, Harpham, who admitted to being a white
supremacist, pleaded guilty to attempting to use a weapon of
mass destruction and attempted injury with an explosive,
according to the statement.  “Acts of hate like this one have no place in our country
in the year 2011, but yet, unfortunately, we continue to see
attempted violence in our communities due to racial animus,”
said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the Justice
Department’s Civil Rights Division.  Harpham’s lawyer, Kailey Moran of the Federal Defenders of
Eastern Washington, didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment on the sentence.  The case is U.S. v. Harpham, 11-cr-42, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Washington (Spokane).  To contact the reporter on this story:
