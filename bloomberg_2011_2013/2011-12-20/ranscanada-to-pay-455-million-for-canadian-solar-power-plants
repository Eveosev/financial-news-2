Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)  had its biggest
one-day gain, rising 33 percent after agreeing to sell nine
power plants to TransCanada Corp. for C$470 million ($456
million).  Canadian Solar, which is based in Kitchener, Ontario, and
makes products in China, rose to $2.95 at the close in New York,
the biggest increase since it started trading in November 2006.
The shares were the best performers today on the  Bloomberg
Global Leaders Solar Index. (BLGS)   The Ontario solar plants, which are scheduled to begin
operating between late 2012 and mid-2013, will generate 86
megawatts of power and have a 20-year purchase agreement with
the Ontario Power Authority, Calgary-based TransCanada said in a
statement today. Canadian solar will build the plants using its
photovoltaic panels.  TransCanada is the largest independent power producer in
Ontario and owns, develops or controls 10,800 megawatts of wind,
hydroelectric and nuclear plants in  Canada  and the U.S.
TransCanada rose 0.7 percent to C$43.73 in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
