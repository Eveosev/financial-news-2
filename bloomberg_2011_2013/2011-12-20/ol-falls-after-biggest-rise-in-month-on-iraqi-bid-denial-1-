Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , Hungary’s biggest
refiner, dropped after  Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP) , the
company’s Iraq exploration partner, denied a report that  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is considering a takeover offer for the company.  Mol’s shares fell 1.8 percent to 17,930 forint by 10:44
a.m. in Budapest after soaring 6 percent yesterday. The BUX
 index (BUX)  of shares, in which Mol has a 34 percent weighting,
weakened 0.6 percent to 17,421.40.  Gulf Keystone’s board is not in discussions with regard to
a sale of the company, the Bermuda-based company said in a
statement late yesterday. The Independent on Sunday reported on
Dec. 18 that Exxon, the world’s largest oil company, is weighing
a bid.  “We may see some correction in today’s trading” in Mol
because of Gulf Keystone’s denial, Peter Csaszar, a Warsaw-based
analyst at KBC Securities, wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
