The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency will release standards to combat air-toxics emissions
from  power plants  during an event tomorrow at Children’s
National Medical Center in Washington.  EPA Administrator  Lisa Jackson  and public health officials
will attend the 2 p.m. Washington time announcement, according
to an e-mail today from the agency.  The regulation, the most expensive order being considered
by President Barack Obama’s administration, was formally signed
by the agency Dec. 16, according to spokeswoman Betsaida
Alcantara.  American Electric Power Co. (AEP) ,  Southern Co. (SO)  and other
power producers reliant upon coal have urged the EPA to give
companies an additional year to comply with the new rules.  The EPA says the standard would save lives and create 9,000
more jobs than would be lost, as power plants invest billions of
dollars to install pollution scrubbing systems or build cleaner
natural-gas plants. It estimates the regulation could prevent
17,000 premature deaths from toxic emissions.  The EPA proposal incorporates three separate limits: one
for mercury, a second for acid gases and a third for particulate
matter, which is used to target emissions of metals such as
chromium, selenium and cadmium. Taken together, the health and
economic benefits from cleaning up pollution will dwarf the
costs to industry, according to the agency’s analysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
