The Monday Night Football game in
 San Francisco  between the 49ers and the Pittsburgh Steelers has
begun after a 20-minute delay caused by a  power outage  at
 Candlestick Park .  The 49ers said a power transformer blew outside the stadium
about 20 minutes before kickoff, plunging the stadium into
darkness for about 10 minutes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
