Spain  and  Italy  led a decline in the
cost of insuring against default on government debt before the
 European Central Bank  starts offering three-year loans tomorrow.  Credit-default swaps on Spain dropped 21 basis points to
387 and Italy tumbled 31 to 504, according to CMA prices at 4
p.m. in London. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of
swaps on 15 governments declined 11 basis points to 359.  Investors are betting the ECB’s longer-term refinancing
operation will spur demand for Spanish and Italian debt to use
as collateral for loans. A gain in German confidence, a
successful Spanish bill sale and U.S. housing data that beat
economists forecasts also helped boost confidence.  “So the market has completely latched on to the idea that
LTRO is back-door” quantitative easing, Peter Tchir, the
founder of TF Market Advisors in  New York , wrote in an email.
“The bull case would have banks buying lots of European
sovereign debt with this program.”  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 31.5 basis points to
772.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 7.5 basis points to 179.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 17 basis points to 298 and
the subordinated index dropped 15 to 540.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
