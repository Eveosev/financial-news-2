An Icelandic court ruled that Magnus
Gudmundsson, the former head of the Luxembourg subsidiary of
failed lender  Kaupthing Bank hf , must repay loans given to him
by the bank to buy its shares.  Gudmundsson is liable for a 717.3 million-krona ($5.8
million) loan the bank provided, according to the  ruling 
announced today by Reykjavik District Court. The court upheld a
freezing order on a 20 percent stake in Gudmundsson’s limited
liability company Hvitsstadir ehf, which was imposed by the
Reykjavik District Magistrate’s Office in June.  Less than two weeks before Kaupthing’s failure in October
2008, its board sought to revoke personal liability on loans
given to a number of executives in connection with purchasing
stock. The decision followed a drop in the lender’s share price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
