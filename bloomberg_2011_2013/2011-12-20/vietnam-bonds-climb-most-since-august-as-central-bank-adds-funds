Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained the
most since August after the central bank added cash to the
financial system, increasing the amount of funds available for
lenders to invest in debt. The dong was little changed.  “Liquidity is good as the  State Bank  of Vietnam has been
injecting money into the system through open-market
operations,” said Vu Anh Duc, a Hanoi-based senior fixed-income
dealer at Vietnam Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and
Trade, also known as VietinBank. “When loans, real estate and
gold investments are risky, banks turn to  government bonds .”  The  yield  on the benchmark five-year notes fell eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 12.47 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
biggest decline since Aug. 31.  The dong traded at 21,020 per dollar as of 4:21 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 21,018 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank fixed the  reference rate 
at 20,813, unchanged since Dec. 14, according to its website.
The dong is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
