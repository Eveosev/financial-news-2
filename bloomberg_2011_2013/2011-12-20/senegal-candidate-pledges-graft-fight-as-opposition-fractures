A Senegalese presidential candidate
split with an opposition coalition, forming his own group and
pledging to battle corruption should he win the West African
nation’s February election.  “We need a system of good governance in this country,”
Abdou Latif Coulibaly said in a phone interview today.
“Corruption is the biggest problem in  Senegal .”  His coalition, Benno Alternative 2012, split from main
opposition group Benno Siggil Senegaal, which means United to
Boost Senegal in the local Wolof language. Benno Alternative
broke away over disagreements about the procedure for electing a
candidate, Coulibaly said. He was named as the new party’s pick
on Dec. 15.  Incumbent Abdoulaye Wade plans to run for a third term in
office, with his eligibility set to be decided on by a
Senegalese court. He will face Benno Siggil’s Moustapha Niasse
and Parti Socialiste leader Ousmane Tanor Dieng.  To contact the reporter on this story:
