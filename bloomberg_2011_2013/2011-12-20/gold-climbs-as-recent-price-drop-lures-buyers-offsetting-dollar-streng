Gold rose for the second time in
three sessions as a weakening dollar boosted demand for the
metal as an alternative asset.  The euro advanced against the U.S. currency after  Europe 
pledged 150 billion euros ($196 billion) to the  International
Monetary Fund  to help stem the region’s debt crisis, and as the
 European Central Bank  widened its support for bond markets.
Bullion also gained after German business confidence
unexpectedly rose for a second month in December.  “We moved up on a better-bid euro, after the headlines
that the IMF may put in more funding to help Europe,”  Bart Melek , an analyst at TD Securities in Toronto, said in an e-
mail. Investors buoyed by signs of progress in Europe had a
bigger appetite for risk and were more willing to bet on assets
that may bring better returns than the dollar, which is often
sought as a haven during market turmoil, Melek said.  Gold futures for February delivery climbed 1.3 percent to
settle at $1,617.60 an ounce at 1:36 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Bullion fell 6.9 percent last week as the dollar rallied
against the euro. It has gained 14 percent this year.  The euro rose as much as 1 percent today against the
dollar. The 30-day correlation coefficient between gold and the
euro is at 0.59, compared with minus 0.35 on Oct. 7, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. A figure of minus 1 means the two
tend to move in opposite directions, and 1 means they move in
lockstep.  “Gold below $1,600 is very attractive to investors who
still believe in the longer-term uptrend,” said Yang Shandan, a
senior trader at Cinda Futures Co., rated the second-best China
gold analyst in a Futures Daily and Securities Times poll. “The
dollar will remain a key driver of near-term prices.”  Silver futures for March delivery gained 2.3 percent to
$29.536 an ounce on the Comex, paring its loss this year to 4.5
percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery advanced 1.4 percent to $1,432.90 an ounce. The
metal is down 19 percent this year. Palladium futures for March
delivery gained 1.8 percent to $628.60 an ounce. Prices have
dropped 22 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
