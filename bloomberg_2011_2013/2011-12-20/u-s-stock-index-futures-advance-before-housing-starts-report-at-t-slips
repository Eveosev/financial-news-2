U.S. stocks climbed, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest gain of the month, as
better-than-estimated housing starts added to expectations the
world’s largest economy will weather  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Homebuilders  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  and  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  rose more
than 6.3 percent.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  rallied at least 3.7 percent, pacing gains among
the biggest companies.  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  surged 23 percent as
the investment bank reported profit that beat estimates.  Sprint
Nextel (S)  Corp. jumped 9.3 percent and  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)  added
8.9 percent as AT&T Inc. pulled its bid for  T-Mobile USA .  The S&P 500 rose 3 percent to 1,241.30 at 4 p.m. New York
time, as 492 out of 500 stocks gained. The gauge lost 1.2
percent yesterday. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 337.32
points, or 2.9 percent, to 12,103.58 today. The Russell 2000
Index of small companies rallied 4.2 percent to 738.22.  “The housing report is one more brick in the wall and an
important indication of economic strengthening,” Mark Luschini,
chief investment strategist at Philadelphia-based Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages $54 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “Things are improving and that’s helping
to buttress better the impact of Europe’s crisis.”  Stocks  gained (SPX)  as  builders  broke ground in November on more
houses than at any time in the past 19 months. Concern about
Europe’s debt crisis eased today as German  business confidence 
unexpectedly grew and Spain sold 5.64 billion euros ($7.36
billion) of bills, more than the maximum target.  Average Since 1954  Today’s rally trimmed this year’s drop in the S&P 500 to
1.3 percent. The benchmark measure had tumbled 12 percent from a
three-year high in April through yesterday as Europe struggled
to tame its debt crisis. It’s trading for 13.1 times reported
earnings, compared with the average since 1954 of 16.4 times,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “You’re getting a discount to buy equities,” said  Michael Strauss , who helps oversee about $27 billion of assets as the
chief investment strategist at Commonfund in Wilton,
Connecticut. He spoke in a telephone interview. “I’m hoping we
get some separation of the U.S. economic events from some of the
European events. Stocks are very reasonably priced.”  The  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical Index of companies which tend
to benefit the most from economic growth added 3.8 percent. A
measure of homebuilders in S&P indexes jumped 6.4 percent as 11
of its 12 stocks gained. PulteGroup climbed 10 percent to $6.17
for the biggest increase in the S&P 500. Lennar advanced 6.3
percent to $19.68. Caterpillar rose 5.1 percent to $91.73.
Chevron rose 4 percent to $103.67.  Banks Rebound  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  of 24 stocks climbed 4.1 percent. Bank
of America, which yesterday ended at the lowest level since
March 2009, gained 3.7 percent to $5.17.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
added 4.9 percent to $32.21.  Jefferies rallied 23 percent, the most since 2008, to
$14.50. The investment bank that’s been fighting speculation
about its financial strength rose after fiscal fourth-quarter
profit beat estimates on a recovery in fixed-income trading.
Jefferies may not have to raise more equity after reducing
assets on its balance sheet,  Sean Egan  of Egan-Jones Ratings Co.
said today on CNBC.  Phone shares rose as  AT&T (T) ’s $39 billion bid to acquire
Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile USA came to an end yesterday.
AT&T failed to convince the  Justice Department , which sued to
block the transaction in August, that it could remedy the market
impact of absorbing T-Mobile. AT&T added 1.3 percent to $29.12.  Sprint, Juniper  Sprint Nextel jumped 9.3 percent to $2.36.  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  gained 1.5 percent to $39.21. Juniper
Networks, a maker of networking equipment, surged 8.9 percent to
$19.74.  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  soared 9.2 percent to $27.46 after
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. said AT&T may seek to acquire the second-
largest U.S. satellite-TV company to gain wireless spectrum.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  rallied 3.6 percent to $395.95. The Cupertino,
California-based company won a patent-infringement ruling that
bans some HTC Corp. smartphones from the U.S. starting next
year, bolstering efforts to prove that devices running Google
Inc.’s Android operating system copy the iPhone.  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  tumbled 10 percent to $26.19 at 5:23 p.m. New
York time. The second-largest software maker reported quarterly
sales and profit that missed analysts’ estimates as customers
held off on purchasing database and applications software. The
shares rose 1.9 percent to $29.17 in regular trading.  CVS Caremark Corp. rose 8.9 percent to $39.80. The largest
U.S. distributor of  prescription drugs   boosted (CVS)  its quarterly
dividend to 16.25 cents a share from 12.5 cents a share.  Red Hat  Red Hat Inc. (RHT)  tumbled 8.9 percent, the biggest decline in
the S&P 500, to $41.95. The largest seller of the open-source
Linux operating system reported third-quarter billings and
deferred revenue that missed some analysts’ estimates.  Today’s equity rally brought the  S&P 500  above its average
price of the past 50 days. Still, the index needs to rise above
its 200-day average, a level where the gauge has stalled three
times since October, to sustain its rally, Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC said.  “A closing breakout above 1,260 is what the markets
need,” Dan Wantrobski, the Philadelphia-based director of
technical research at Janney, wrote in a report today. “A
convincing breakout above this threshold would be bullish for
U.S. equities overall.”  The S&P 500’s advance from its 2011 low on Oct. 3 faltered
after the gauge closed above the 200-day threshold on Oct. 27,
Oct 28 and Nov. 8. The index also traded above the level on an
intraday basis for three days starting Dec. 5, only to retreat
amid concern that European leaders may not be able to contain
the region’s credit crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
