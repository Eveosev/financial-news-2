Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to keep Agbami crude exports in February
unchanged at seven cargoes, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will also export six consignments of Brass
River, four Escravos, two Antan, two EA, two Okono and one Abo,
the plan showed. The sizes of shipments range from 90,000
barrels to 975,000 barrels.  Shipping schedules of Akpo, Amenam, Erha, Okwori, Oso and
Pennington grades are not yet available.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
