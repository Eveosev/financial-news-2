The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of
24 commodities headed for the biggest gain since October, led by
rallies in cocoa, crude oil, gasoline and nickel as the dollar
dropped.  The index advanced 2.5 percent to 634.69 at 1:07 p.m. in
 New York  as the greenback declined after a report showed housing
starts at the highest in a year, spurring optimism of a U.S.
recovery. A settlement at that level would mark the largest
increase for the index since Oct. 27.  “We were already off to the races before the housing
starts number, so that just kind of confirmed the move,” said
 Dan Flynn , a trader at PFG Best in Chicago. “You’ve got all
this news around the globe. Crude oil’s flying, the stock market
is up. Everything’s following suit.”  A Commerce Department report released today in  Washington 
showed  housing starts  increased 9.3 percent to a 685,000 annual
rate, exceeding the highest estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News and the highest level since April 2010.  Building permits, a proxy for future construction, climbed
to a 681,000 annual pace in November, the highest level since
March 2010.  Crude for January delivery gained $3.33, or 3.6 percent, to
$97.21 a barrel at 1:09 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract expires today. Prices are 6.4 percent
higher this year after rising 15 percent in 2010. The more
actively traded February contract rose $3.31 to $97.36.  Cocoa futures for March delivery climbed 5.6 percent to
$2,185 a ton in New York. Cocoa for March delivery rose 4.2
percent to 1,400 pounds ($2,193.24) a ton in  London .  Gasoline for January delivery rose 8.84 cents, or 3.6
percent, to $2.5775 a gallon as of 1:11 p.m. in New York, the
biggest gain since Oct. 27. The futures are up 5.1 percent this
year.  Copper futures for March delivery increased 1.8 percent to
$3.361 a pound at 1:13 p.m. on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
