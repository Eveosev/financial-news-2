Swiss Life Insurance and Patrimoine
expects a harder landing than expected at the end of this year,
Chief Executive Officer Eric Le Baron told  La Tribune  in an
interview.  Le Baron estimates that the market should shrink by about
14 percent over the year in gross premium terms and in terms of
net premiums it will also decline, La Tribune reported. Net
premiums will stop falling during 2012, Le Baron said, according
to the French newspaper.  Link to Company News:  To contact the reporter on this story:
