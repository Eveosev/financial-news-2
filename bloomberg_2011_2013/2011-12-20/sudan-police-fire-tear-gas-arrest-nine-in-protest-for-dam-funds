Sudanese police fired tear gas and
arrested nine people during a protest in Khartoum, the capital,
over a hydroelectric dam, according to a witness.  The demonstrators blocked traffic in parts of the city and
chanted slogans calling for compensation for residents displaced
by the  Merowe Dam , said Qesm Allah Ali Qesm Allah, 27, by phone
today. He took part in the protest. Several people were injured,
he said.  Police spokesman al-Ser Ahmed Omar said police didnâ€™t use
violence and put the number of arrests at seven. He said by
phone today those people were immediately released.  The dam, 350 kilometers (217 miles) north of Khartoum on
the Nile river, was completed in 2009 and financed by  China , the
Arab Fund for Social & Economical Development, the Saudi Fund
for Development and other Arab funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
