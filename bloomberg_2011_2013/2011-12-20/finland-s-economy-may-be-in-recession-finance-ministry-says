Finland  may have entered a
recession, the  Finance Ministry  said, cutting its forecast for
growth in the northernmost euro member’s economy.  Gross domestic product will expand 0.4 percent next year,
compared with growth of 1.8 percent forecast in October, the
Helsinki-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.
“The forecast contains the possibility of the economy
experiencing a recession in late 2011 and early 2012,” the
ministry said.  Growth will accelerate to 1.7 percent in 2013, the ministry
said. The ministry’s estimate matches last week’s forecast by
the Bank of Finland, which also expects growth of 0.4 percent in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
