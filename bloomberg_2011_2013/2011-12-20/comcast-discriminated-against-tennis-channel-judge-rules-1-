Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  unlawfully
discriminated against the Tennis Channel by placing it in
different viewing packages than the cable company’s own sports
programming, a Federal Communications Commission official ruled.  Chief Administrative Law Judge Richard Sippel assessed the
maximum penalty of $375,000 against Comcast and said the largest
U.S. cable operator must give Tennis Channel the same treatment
it provides to its affiliated sports networks Versus and Golf
Channel, according to the Dec. 16 ruling distributed by e-mail
today.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, disagrees with Sippel’s
decision and will ask the full commission to review the ruling,
 Sena Fitzmaurice , a Washington-based spokeswoman for the
company, said in an e-mailed statement.  Comcast exercised its contractual right to distribute
Tennis Channel as it currently does, which minimizes costs to
viewers, Fitzmaurice said. “It is wrong for Tennis Channel to
use the government to impose higher costs and prices on private
enterprise and consumers,” she said.  Ken Solomon, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based
Tennis Channel, in an e-mailed statement called the ruling “a
watershed moment for independent programming networks.”  Solomon said “we just want to be treated the same way
major operators treat the networks they own.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Todd Shields in
