European Union regulators plan to
increase scrutiny for public services that receive subsidies of
more than 15 million euros ($19.6 million) a year under proposed
rules published today.  The European Commission may also exempt social services
from state-aid scrutiny and may not require EU aid reviews for
public services that receive less than 500,000 euros from
governments over three years, according to an e-mailed statement
today. The EU plans to introduce the updated rules next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
