U.S.  home prices  will continue to
decline through late 2012 or early 2013 as negative equity and
weak job growth hinder a real estate recovery, according to a
survey by  Zillow Inc .  After 2013, prices may rise about 3 percent a year through
2016, which is slightly below appreciation rates experienced
before the residential market collapsed, Seattle-based Zillow
said in a statement today. The real estate data provider
surveyed more than 100 economists, property experts and
investment and market strategists.  The survey is based on the projected path of the S&P/Case-
Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index over the next five years.
Home prices have fallen 31 percent from a July 2006 peak through
September, based on a Case-Shiller  index  of values in 20 U.S.
cities.  “There is a consensus among the nation’s top housing
experts that we have not yet reached a bottom and are instead
working through a prolonged bottoming process,”  Stan Humphries ,
Zillow’s chief economist, said in the statement. “Negative
equity, unemployment and low  consumer confidence  remain the key
factors delaying a true recovery.”  About 29 percent of U.S. borrowers had negative equity, or
owed more than their houses were worth, in the third quarter,
Zillow data show. The nation’s jobless rate, 8.6 percent in
November, was 9 percent or higher for all but three months in
the last two years.  Panelists’ expectations for the period ending in 2016
varied widely, Zillow said. The most optimistic quartile
projected about 18 percent growth in home prices over the next
five years, while the most pessimistic forecast a 1.4 percent
decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
