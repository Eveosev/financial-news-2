Japan ’s government may allocate
about 50 billion yen ($641 million) for a new nuclear regulator
to be formed in April following the Fukushima crisis.  The budget represents an increase of 35 percent from about
37 billion yen allocated for nuclear safety in the year to March
31, the  Environment Ministry  said in a statement today, after
submitting a budget request.  The agency is being formed under the Environment Ministry
from the merger of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency of
the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry and the Nuclear
Safety Commission of Japan, which reports to the Cabinet Office.
The bodies were criticized for lapses that contributed to the
nuclear disaster.  The new regulator, which plans to employ about 500 people,
will inspect nuclear plants and check radiation levels. It will
also be in charge of monitoring the health of those affected by
the nuclear disaster, according to the statement.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant had
meltdowns in three reactors after the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami knocked out cooling and power, triggering the worst
nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.  To contact the reporter on this story:
