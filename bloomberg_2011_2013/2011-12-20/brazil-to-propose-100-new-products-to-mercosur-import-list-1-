Brazil  will propose adding 100 new
imports to a list of 100 products that can be charged a 35
percent import tariff to enter Mercosur nations, Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega  said in Montevideo today.  The tariff will protect industries in the region from
cheaper imports, Mantega said today as finance ministers and
central bankers from the free-trade area met in Montevideo.  “With this we can make a better defense at a moment when
every country in the region is being flooded by foreign goods,”
Mantega told reporters.  The trade bloc that is made of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay
and Uruguay is still working on the list of goods, Argentina’s
Foreign Minister Hector Timerman told reporters in Montevideo.
The government of President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  seeks
to raise taxes on imports to protect the region from the global
crisis, Timerman said in a statement released by the Foreign
Ministry.  “Let’s be friends and partners,” Timerman said, according
to the statement. “Let’s not allow the foreign crisis to be a
reason to move back our social and economic development.”  The countries will continue discussions on the import goods
tomorrow, when presidents of the Mercosur countries meet in
Montevideo, Mantega said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
