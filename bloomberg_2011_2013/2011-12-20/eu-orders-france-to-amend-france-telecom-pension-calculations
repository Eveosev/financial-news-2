European Union regulators ordered
the French government to amend by July 2012 the way it
calculates how much  France Telecom SA (FTE)  must contribute to retiree
costs for former state employees.  The European Commission said it could close a probe into
state aid for  Europe ’s third-largest phone company if  France 
includes the cost of risks, such as a guarantee for paying wages
during a bankruptcy, to a contribution the company makes toward
pensions for workers every year.  Under a 1997 government reform of the company’s pension
funding, France Telecom was no longer required to ensure the
financing of the retirement plan for its employees, who were
considered government workers. The French government assumed
responsibility for the pensions and the company was required to
make a contribution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
