Canadian natural gas fell amid mild
weather and abundant U.S. stockpiles of the fuel that have been
boosted by higher output.  Alberta  gas dropped 1.2 percent as Weather Derivatives of
Belton,  Missouri , said heating demand across the U.S. will be 23
percent below normal through Dec. 27. Explorers have reduced gas
drilling rigs to 818 last week from 934 on Oct. 28 to help ease
a glut of supplies, according to Baker Hughes Inc.  “A very mild November and December explains some of the
recent storage surplus,” said  Stephen Smith , an energy analyst
and president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates in Natchez,
 Mississippi . “The sharp decline in rig count over the last
seven weeks suggests that production growth will be slowing
although the price recovery process is likely to be slow.”  Alberta gas for January delivery slipped 3.5 cents to
C$2.78 a gigajoule ($2.57 per million British thermal units) as
of 11:30 a.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.
NGX Alberta gas has fallen 25 percent this year.  Gas for January delivery rose 0.3 cent to $3.099 per
million Btu as of 11:32 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The futures are down 30 percent this year.  TransCanada System  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 17.6 billion cubic
feet, 671 million above its target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.49 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.06 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 870 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.78 billion cubic feet today, about 67 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.83
billion cubic feet at 9:50 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
