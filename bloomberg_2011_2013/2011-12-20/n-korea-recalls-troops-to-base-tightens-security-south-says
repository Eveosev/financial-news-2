North Korea  tightened security at
military units and recalled some troops back to base after the
leader Kim Jong Il’s death,  South Korea ’s defense ministry said.  Nothing in the movements of the troops points to imminent
provocation, the ministry said in a statement in Seoul today.
The units that returned to their bases overnight were conducting
annual winter drills, the ministry said, without indicating
their size or location.  Most units along the North Korean border are flying flags
at half-mast, according to the statement.  The U.S. and South Korean military are continuing
surveillance of North Korea and remain on alert, the ministry
said. While South Korea raised its “infocon” cyber alert, it
hasn’t changed its surveillance “watchcon” or combat
“Defcon” alerts, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
