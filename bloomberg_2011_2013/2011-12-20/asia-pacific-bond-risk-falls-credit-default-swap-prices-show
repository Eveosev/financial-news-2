The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 2 basis points to
193 basis points as of 11:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The Markit iTraxx
Asia index of 40 investment-grade borrowers outside  Japan 
declined 2 basis points to 214.5 basis points as of 8:48 a.m. in
 Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 0.5 basis point to 193
as of 9:39 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
