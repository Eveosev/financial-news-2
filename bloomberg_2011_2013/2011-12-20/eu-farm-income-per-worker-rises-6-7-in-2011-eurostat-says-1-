European Union farm income per
worker rose an estimated 6.7 percent in 2011 after a 13-percent
jump last year, helped by rising prices for grains as well as
increased productivity, statistics office Eurostat said.  Income probably climbed in 19 of the EU’s 27 member states,
and fell in the other eight, Eurostat said in an online  report 
today. An index of average real agricultural income per worker
climbed to 118.3 points, with the base year 2005.  The value of the EU’s agricultural production is estimated
to have increased 7.5 percent this year on higher prices for
crops and animal products, according to the bloc’s statistics
office. EU farm production was 358 billion euros ($468 billion)
last year at basic prices, Eurostat data show.  “Between 2005 and 2011, EU27 real agricultural income per
worker is estimated to have increased by 18.3 percent, while
agricultural labor input has fallen by 15.2 percent,” the
statistics office wrote.  Real income per agricultural worker rose an estimated 3.9
percent in 2011, while labor input fell 2.7 percent, according
to Eurostat’s first estimates. Crop-production value probably
increased 8 percent, while for animal production it rose 7.8
percent, Eurostat said.  Romania is expected to have the biggest gain in farm income
per worker, with an increase of 44 percent, followed by Hungary
with 42 percent, the data show. Income in  France , the bloc’s
largest agricultural producer, probably fell 2.6 percent,
Eurostat reported.  In  Belgium , the country with the biggest decline, farm
income per worker slumped an estimated 23 percent this year,
according to Eurostat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
