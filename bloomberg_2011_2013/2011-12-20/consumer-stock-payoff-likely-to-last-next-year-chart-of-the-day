Consumer stocks are defying this
year’s drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index regardless of
their ties to the economy, and UBS AG says they will keep
beating the market next year.  “The American consumer is alive and well and consumer
companies are likely to post solid results in 2012,”  Jonathan Golub , the chief U.S. market strategist at UBS, wrote yesterday
in a report.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks two consumer-related industry
groups, consisting of companies in the  S&P 500 . Both had gains
for the year through yesterday even though the benchmark index
dropped 4.2 percent.  Makers of food, beverages and other consumer staples in the
S&P 500 gained 7.1 percent as a group. Their index was the
year’s second-best performer among the 10 main industry groups
in the benchmark, and only trailed utilities. An index of
retailers, media companies and other industries that rely on
consumers’ discretionary index added 0.3 percent.  Consumers have a lighter debt load because household
borrowing is dropping along with  interest rates , wrote Golub,
based in New York. Debt payments have declined to 11 percent of
disposable income from 14 percent, according to government data
cited in the report.  Increased employment and easier access to  consumer credit 
also point toward spending growth, the report said. The number
of people working increased by 1.3 million for the four months
ended in November, according to figures compiled by the Labor
Department. Banks are easing standards for credit cards and
consumer loans, based on data from Federal Reserve surveys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
