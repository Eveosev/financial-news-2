Global crushing of 10 oilseeds will
climb 4.3 percent in the year through September 2012, with the
biggest gain in processing of sunflower seeds, industry
researcher Oil World forecast.  Crushing will climb to 393.2 million metric tons in 2011-12
from 376.9 million tons a year earlier, Hamburg-based Oil World
said in a e-mailed report.  The increase in oilseed crushing will lag behind the year-
earlier gain of 5.3 percent, in part due to lack of demand for
soy meal, a by-product of oil extraction from soybeans that’s
used as livestock feed, Oil World forecast.  “The slowdown is partly attributable to problems in
finding sufficient demand for soya meal, given repercussions
from the poor economic development on meat demand and livestock
production,” Oil World said.  The “large” supply of competing feed grains is also
holding back demand, according to the researcher.  Soybean crushing may rise 3.6 percent to 230.5 million tons
from 222.5 million tons, based on the Oil World forecasts.
Sunflower-seed processing will jump 14 percent to 34.1 million
tons from 30 million tons, according to the report.  Crushing of rapeseed, the second-most consumed oilseed, is
forecast to slip to 58.2 million tons from 58.5 million tons,
while crushers may process 36 million tons of cotton seed, from
33.1 million tons in 2010-11, Oil World data show.  “The most dynamic development is occurring in sunseed,”
Oil World said, adding it expects increases in Ukraine,  Russia 
and the European Union. “The downtrend in rapeseed processing
is seen continuing,” the forecaster said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
