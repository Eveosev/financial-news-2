Billionaire  Sam Zell  sued former
shareholders of the bankrupt publisher  Tribune Co. , claiming he
should be paid along with other creditors should a court rule
the 2007 buyout he engineered was a fraud.  The suit, filed by the Zell-controlled company EGI-TRB LLC,
defends the buyout as legitimate while also attempting to
preserve Zell’s ability to collect money should a court
disagree.  “If it is determined that the selling shareholder payments
represent fraudulent conveyances, EGI-TRB is entitled to recover
from such transfers or conveyances in an amount in excess of
$225 million,” Zell’s attorneys said in court papers filed in
state court in  Chicago  yesterday.  Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times, the  Chicago
Tribune , television stations and cable channels, filed
bankruptcy one year after Zell used borrowed money to buyout
shareholders for $8.3 billion.  Abigayle Pfeiffer, a spokeswoman for shareholder Robert R.
McCormick Foundation, didn’t immediately respond to a voicemail
message seeking comment about the lawsuit.  Pre-buyout creditors including hedge fund  Aurelius Capital
Management LP  claim the buyout was a so-called fraudulent
conveyance because it put so much debt on Tribune the company
couldn’t survive. Aurelius helped devise a strategy to file
dozens of lawsuits against shareholders in state court.  The case filed by Zell is EGI-TRB LLC V. ABN Amro Clearing
Chicago LLC et al. The bankruptcy case is In re Tribune Co.,
08-bk-13141,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
