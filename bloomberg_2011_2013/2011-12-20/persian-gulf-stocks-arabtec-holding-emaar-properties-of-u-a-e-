Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  fell 1
percent to 1,360.80, the lowest level since Nov. 27, at the 2
p.m. close in the emirate. The measure has lost 17 percent this
year. Abu Dhabi’s ADX General Index declined 0.8 percent today.  The following shares were active in the Persian Gulf
region. Stock symbols follow company names.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)   fell 5.2 percent, the most
since August 7, to 1.65 percent amid investor speculation that
its surge of 13 percent this month may have been overdone.  “Arabtec has been outperforming aggressively lately so
this correction is very expected, and is even softer than the
rally,” said Chahir Hosni, equity sales manager at EFG-Hermes
Holding SAE.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)   rose as much as 2.3
percent to 2.62 dirhams before paring gains to close at 2.57
dirhams. The builder of the world’s tallest skyscraper in  Dubai
said after the market closed yesterday it paid a lower price to
raise $980 million than for its existing debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
