December shipments of 228,700, according a Nov. 23 notice.  The Puget Sound line will carry 133,000 barrels a day next
month, the company said today.  The 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) Trans Mountain system runs

central British Columbia, the Vancouver area and the Puget Sound
region in  Washington , according to the company’s website.  Products also move to  California , the U.S. Gulf Coast and
overseas through the Westridge marine terminal in Burnaby,
British Columbia.  Nominations for “advanced timing” shipments to the
