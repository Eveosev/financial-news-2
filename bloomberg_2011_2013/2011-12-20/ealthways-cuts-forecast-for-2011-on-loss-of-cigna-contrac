Healthways Inc. (HWAY) , a manager of
diabetes and heart disease services, lowered its forecast for
2011 and cut jobs after losing a contract with the health
insurer  Cigna Corp. (CI)   Healthways will have a net loss of $4.67 to $4.56 per
share, compared with an earlier forecast that it would earn 90
cents to $1 a share, the Franklin, Tennessee-based company said
today in a statement.  The contract with Cigna, which ends in 2013, accounts for
16 percent of the company’s 2011 revenue, Moody’s Investors
Service said in a Dec. 15 statement. Healthways will take a
goodwill writedown of $184 million, or $5.36 per diluted share,
and a severance charge of $8.5 million, or about 15 cents a
share.  “This writedown is a non-cash charge, and it is expected
to have no impact on our liquidity, future operations or
compliance with our debt covenants,” Chief Financial Officer
Alfred Lumsdaine said in the statement.  Healthways cut 10 percent of its workforce, or 275 jobs,
“which is obviously a difficult but necessary step,” Chief
Executive Officer Ben Leedle said today on a conference call.  Without the charges, net income would be 85 cents to 94
cents a share, Healthways said. The company will close two Cigna
call centers by mid-January. On Dec. 15, Moody’s downgraded
Healthways to Ba3, three steps below investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
