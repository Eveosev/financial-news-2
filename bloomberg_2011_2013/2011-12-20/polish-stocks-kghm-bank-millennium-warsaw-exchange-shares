Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  rose 1.5
percent to 2,136.95 points, paring this year’s decline to 22
percent.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, gained 1.9 percent to 106.6 zloty,
rising for the first time in seven days, after signing a deal to
sell copper cathodes to China Minmetals Corp. from 2012 through
2016. The Polish company values the agreement at $1.83 billion
to $3.66 billion.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL)   fell 1.8 percent to 3.31 zloty,
the lowest close since July 2009. Banco Comercial Portugues SA
decided to keep its majority stake in the Polish unit after
receiving offers for its acquisition.  Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW)   gained 2 percent to 34.9
zloty, snapping an eight-day decline. The operator of Poland’s
sole equity market expects to pay close to 100 percent of its
2011 net income as a dividend and plans to follow a policy of
paying “high dividends” in coming years, Chief Executive
Officer Ludwik Sobolewski said at a news conference in Warsaw
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
