Mexichem SAB, the Latin American
chemical producer which has bought more than 15 companies since
2007, said it still seeks to acquire  Wavin NV (WAVIN) , the company said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Mexichem “still has the intention to submit a request for
approval of its offer” for Wavin, according to the statement.  Mexichem offered to pay 9 euros a share, or 457 million
euros ($597.9 million,) for the Zwolle, Netherlands-based
company, according to a Dec. 6 statement. Following the offer,
Wavin,  Europe ’s biggest maker of plastic pipes for sewers, said
it was “unacceptable.”  The 9 euro-a-share offer “materially undervalues the
company and its prospects,” Wavin said in a separate statement
Dec. 6.  Mexichem had previously offered to pay Wavin 8.5 euros per
share on Nov. 22.  Editor: Jonathan Roeder  To contact the reporter on this story:
