Bundesbank Board member Andreas Dombret said the sovereign debt crisis cannot be solved by
beefing up the rescue funds or cranking up the central bank
printing presses.  The strategy of increasing bailout funds “will hit a wall,
either a political one or a financial one,” Dombret said,
according to the text of a speech delivered today in Frankfurt.
“Any suggestion to push that limit by printing money is
dangerous.”  Dombret said that while a central bank’s resources are
almost “infinite in theory,” employing them to buy up
 government bonds  would compromise the institution’s
independence, “one of the most important pillars” of a stable
currency.  The Bundesbank is opposed to the  European Central Bank ’s
government-bond purchase program, which it employs to smooth the
transmission of  interest rates . The ECB has rejected demands by
investors and political leaders to step up the purchases to stem
surging euro-area borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
