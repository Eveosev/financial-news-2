Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Spain’s second-biggest lender, will spend 220 billion pesos
($114 million) to expand in  Colombia  next year and is open to an
acquisition there, said Oscar Cabrera, the bank’s local unit
president.  “Our goal in Colombia is to grow,” Cabrera told reporters
in Bogota. Next year’s expansion will include 19 new offices, he
said.  BBVA has no plans to sell Latin America assets to meet new
European  capital requirements , Cabrera said. Madrid-based Banco
Santander SA agreed Dec. 6 to sell a 95 percent stake in its
Colombian unit to CorpBanca, Chile’s sixth-largest lender by
assets, for about $1.16 billion.  “There’s no interest in selling in Latin America,”
Cabrera said. “One doesn’t sell where there’s good news, and
this is the region with the most positive prospects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
