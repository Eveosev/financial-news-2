Globaltrans Investment Plc (GLTR) , a
Russian private rail-cargo carrier, may spend as much as $700
million to acquire rail units from two domestic steelmakers to
boost freight volumes,  Kommersant  said.  Globaltrans board of directors may agree today to acquire
rail units of  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel , or MMK, and
billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s  OAO Metalloinvest , which have a
combined fleet of 13,400 freightcars, the Moscow-based newspaper
reported, citing people it didn’t name.  No-one in the press office of Globaltrans was available for
comment when contacted out of hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
