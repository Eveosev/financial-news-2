Treasuries  dropped, with yields on
30-year bonds climbing from an 11-week low, as U.S. housing
starts topped economists’ estimates and German business
confidence unexpectedly grew.  Even with prices falling, the Treasury sold $35 billion of
five-year notes at a record low yield of 0.88 percent,
underscoring the persistent investor demand for shorter-term
 U.S. debt  as a refuge from Europe’s financial crisis. The U.S.
also received record demand for $30 billion of  four-week bills 
auctioned at a rate of zero. Treasuries surged last week the
most since early November.  “The market has gotten fatigued,” said  Scott Graham , head
of government-bond trading at Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital
Markets unit in  Chicago , one of the 21 primary dealers required
to bid in U.S. debt offerings. “We’ve had better data of late
and some positive rumbling out of Europe, but there is still
pent-up demand for Treasuries, and you see that at the auctions
amid the uncertainty.”  Thirty-year yields  rose 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage
point, to 2.93 percent at 5:10 p.m.  New York  time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They touched 2.78 percent
yesterday, the lowest level since Oct. 4, after falling 26 basis
points last week. The 3.125 percent debt due in November 2041
slid 2 29/32, or $29.06 per $1,000 face amount, to 103 30/32.  Current  five-year note  yields increased five basis points
to 0.86 percent, and benchmark  10-year yields  jumped 11 basis
points to 1.92 percent after falling to 1.80 percent yesterday.  Five-year notes have returned 9.2 percent this year,
compared with 10 percent for the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Demand Gauge  At today’s note auction, the  bid-to-cover  ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of debt
offered, was 2.86, versus an average 2.85 at the past 10 sales
and 3.15 at the November offering. The average forecast for the
yield was 0.885 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven
primary dealers.  Last month’s offering of five-year notes drew a then-
record low yield of 0.937 percent.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 50.6 percent of the notes today, the most
since August 2010. They averaged 42.1 percent at the past 10
offerings. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that
place their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 9.1
percent, the least since May.  Four-Week Bills  The government’s sale of  four-week bills  today had a bid-
to-cover ratio of 9.07, a record high. The previous record was
7.66 on Dec. 6.  The U.S. will sell $29 billion of seven-year notes
tomorrow. It auctioned $35 billion of two-year securities
yesterday, drawing a yield of 0.24 percent, up from a record low
0.222 percent in August.  “Demand for Treasuries at auctions is as robust as ever,
as so much uncertainly from  Europe  and the domestic economy
continues to persist,” said Thomas Simons, a government debt
economist in New York at the primary dealer Jefferies Group Inc.
“All bets are off for tomorrow’s auction. It should come in
well, but we are in a very weird market with the risk-on, risk-
off mentality ahead of the holidays where trading has been
thin.”  The government auctioned $78 billion last week in notes,
bonds and inflation-linked debt. It sold $12 billion in five-
year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities Dec. 15 at a record
low yield of negative 0.877 percent. A $13 billion sale of 30-
year bonds Dec. 14 drew a  record low  yield of 2.925 percent and
a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.05, the highest in 11 years. Auctions
of 10- and three-year notes also drew higher-than-average demand
as investors sought refuge from European sovereign-debt turmoil.  Spanish Bonds  Treasuries fell earlier today as  Spanish 10-year  yields
dropped to a two-month low of 5.06 percent, down from 6.78
percent on Nov. 17. The  European Central Bank  offered unlimited
three-year loans to the region’s banks.  Spain  sold 5.64 billion
euros ($7.4 billion) of the three- and six-month bills,
exceeding its maximum target of 4.5 billion euros. Italian two-
year note yields decreased for a fourth day and reached 4.91
percent, the lowest since Oct. 31.  The Ifo institute’s index of  Germany ’s  business climate 
rose to 107.2 from 106.6 in November, the Munich-based group
said. Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast a drop to 106.  ‘Risk Is On’  “The information out of Europe is good, and it led people
to think risk is on for today,” said  William O’Donnell , head
U.S. government bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc’s RBS Securities unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , a primary
dealer. “Even though the European authorities haven’t addressed
the core issue of solvency, the liquidity measures are starting
to gain traction.”  U.S.  housing starts  increased 9.3 percent to a 685,000
annual rate, the highest level since April 2010, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington .  Stocks climbed, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
gaining 3 percent, the most this month.  Consumer spending  rose in November, adding 0.3 percent, a
Bloomberg survey of economists showed before a Commerce
Department report due Dec. 23.  The difference in yield between 10-year Treasuries and
inflation-protected debt, a measure of the outlook for consumer
prices known as the  break-even rate , increased to as much as
2.04 percent, the widest in a week on an intraday basis.  The Fed purchased $2.512 billion of Treasuries today due
from February 2036 to May 2041 as part of a plan announced in
September to replace $400 billion of shorter maturities in its
holdings with longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs and
support the economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
