The Spanish region of Catalonia,
which has an economy the size of  Portugal ’s, approved a 2012
budget increasing tax and cutting spending to meet a deficit
goal next year of 1.3 percent of gross domestic product.  The wealthiest of  Spain ’s 17 semi-autonomous regions
forecasts 0.8 percent economic growth in 2012 and will reduce
non-financial public spending by 0.7 percent, after 10 percent
last year. It will increase taxes and other sources of revenue,
the region said today in an e-mailed statement from Barcelona.  Spain’s regions control more than a third of the nation’s
public spending, including health and education, and may
contribute to its missing a budget-deficit  target  of 6 percent
of economic output in 2011. Catalonia is ruled by the regional
CiU nationalist party, whose pro-business policy is similar to
the program defended by Prime Minister-elect Mariano Rajoy.  If the budget is approved by the regional parliament in the
first quarter of 2012, Catalonia will save 625 million euros
($819 million) in wages through measures such as cutting bonuses
of some 200 higher-ranking officials. It would increase tax
receipts by 210 million euros a year by raising the tax on
gasoline and creating a tax on tourists.  An additional 888 million euros would come from the sale of
public buildings and management contracts in 2012. The region
also plans to increase public tariffs such as the water tariff
and charge patients for medical prescriptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
