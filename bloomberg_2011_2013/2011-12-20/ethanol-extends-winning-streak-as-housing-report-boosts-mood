Ethanol futures extended the longest
winning streak since Nov. 16 after a report that U.S. builders
started on the most houses in 19 months.  Futures rose 1.3 percent as the Commerce Department said
housing starts increased 9.3 percent last month to a 685,000
annual rate, exceeding the highest estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “It’s holiday exuberance,” said Peyton Feltus, president
of Randolph Risk Management Inc. in  Dallas . “The housing starts
number was nice, I reckon. Everyone’s in a positive mood.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery advanced 2.8 cents
to $2.14 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the third
consecutive gain in the longest such streak since Nov. 16.
Prices are down 10 percent in 2011, heading for the first yearly
decline since 2008.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago added 5 cents,
or 2.3 percent, to $2.205 a gallon and in  New York  the additive
increased 4.5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast jumped 4 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to $2.315 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel advanced 3
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.325.  Crude oil for January delivery gained $3.34, or 3.6
percent, to settle at $97.22 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The January contract expires today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
