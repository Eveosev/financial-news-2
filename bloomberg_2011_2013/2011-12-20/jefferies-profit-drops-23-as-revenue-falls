Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  jumped 23
percent, the most in three years, after fiscal fourth-quarter
profit beat analysts’ estimates and Egan-Jones Ratings Co. said
the firm may not need to raise more equity.  The stock rose $2.70 to $14.50 in New York, the biggest
increase since Nov. 24, 2008. Earnings per share excluding some
items amounted to 17 cents for the three months ended Nov. 30,
compared with the 14-cent average estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income fell 23 percent to $48.4
million from the year-earlier period, the New York-based firm
said in a statement.  The company’s shares have fallen 46 percent this year as
Wall Street banks struggle to maintain trading revenue and as  MF
Global Holdings Ltd. (MF) ’s Oct. 31 bankruptcy fueled what Jefferies
called unfounded speculation it may be toppled by  Europe ’s debt
crisis. Fixed-income trading revenue surged to $140.7 million
from $33.1 million in the third quarter.  The firm “successfully navigated an extremely challenging
fourth quarter that included continuing global volatility
compounded by a November filled with a barrage of misinformation
about Jefferies,” Chief Executive Officer  Richard Handler , 50,
said in the statement.  Jefferies cut total assets to $35 billion from $45.1
billion at the end of the third quarter. It reduced sovereign
securities holdings last month after Egan-Jones Ratings said it
may face losses tied to the region’s debt crisis.  Fitch Ratings 
said on Dec. 6 that Jefferies has sufficient liquidity to
“weather challenging markets” and on Dec. 15 affirmed the
company’s BBB rating. Jefferies reduced its  leverage ratio  to
9.9-to-1 from 12.9-to-1, according to the statement.  ‘Overperformed’  Jefferies “overperformed” in asset reductions, which
means Egan-Jones can back off from its assertion that the
investment bank might need to raise $1 billion,  Sean Egan  said
today on CNBC.  “They’re doing the right thing on the balance sheet,
bringing their leverage down,” Brad Hintz, an analyst for
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said today on Bloomberg Television’s
“In The Loop.” “They’re pulling in their horns, they’re
battening down the hatches, just like we’re seeing with the big
commercial banks.”  Hintz said he wasn’t “worried” about Jefferies’s European
debt. The firm has $123 million in net short positions in
European debt, Chief Financial Officer Peregrine Broadbent said
today on a conference call to discuss results.  Net Revenue Falls  Net income included a $12 million after-tax gain on debt
extinguishment linked to trading in the firm’s own bonds and $2
million in expenses related to the company’s acquisition of
Prudential Bache. Excluding those items, net income was $39
million.  Net revenue, including the one-time gains, fell 19 percent
from the year-earlier period to $554 million. Revenue from sales
and trading fell 25 percent to $286.1 million, and investment-
banking revenue decreased 10 percent to $261.3 million.  While revenue from fixed-income trading rose from the third
quarter, a period Handler called “brutal” in September, it was
down 38 percent from $227.9 million in the same period last
year. Revenue from trading equities fell to $124.3 million from
$155.1 million a year earlier.  Trading revenue was “impacted by significantly curtailed
business activity caused by the misinformation we experienced
throughout November,” Handler said today on the call. Jefferies
made a “modest” cut in its equities staff since the end of the
fourth quarter, Broadbent said today. Jefferies now employs
3,851 people, compared with 3,898 at Nov. 30 and 3,842 as of
Aug. 31, he said.  Shares Repurchased  The decrease in investment-banking revenue was led by a
decline from  capital markets , which fell 34 percent to $89
million.  Jefferies repurchased 5.1 million shares during its fiscal
fourth quarter at an average price of $10.89 per share,
Broadbent said today on the call. The firm’s board approved
repurchasing an additional 14.9 million shares, he said.  Jefferies set aside $308.1 million, or 56 percent of net
revenue, in compensation expense for the three months ended Nov.
30, compared with $405.4 million, or 60 percent, a year earlier.  Jefferies said Dec. 13 it will claw back 2011 bonuses from
employees who join competitors next year. The firm will award
discretionary cash bonuses with one-year restrictions, requiring
them to be repaid if workers join a rival firm.  “We believe this approach assures that our year-end
compensation pool will only accrue to the benefit of those who
are committed to the long-term success of our firm,” Handler
and  Brian Friedman , chairman of Jefferies’s executive committee,
wrote in an internal memo to employees.  Handler Declines Bonus  Handler and Friedman have declined to receive cash bonuses
for 2011, the CEO said on the call today.  “We recognize our shareholders had a tough year -- we’re
shareholders, and we’re getting zero bonus,” Handler said.  Total non-interest expense fell to $485.9 million in the
three months ended Nov. 30 from $541.3 million last year.  Net revenue for the 12 months ended Nov. 30 was $2.55
billion, compared with $2.19 billion for the 11 months ended
Nov. 30 last year. Jefferies last year changed its fiscal year-
end to Nov. 30 from Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
