Fitch Investors Service expects
“negative rating actions and outlook revisions” on local and
regional governments in  Poland  next year as revenue growth fails
to keep pace with spending, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “In 2012 the operating and budgetary performance of local
governments is likely to further weaken, constraining the
sector’s self-financing capacity,” Fitch said, adding that this
would boost debt and risks regarding the implementation of
strategic infrastructure projects.  Local governments’ operating expenditures may increase by 7
percent next year, outstripping a 5 percent rise in revenue, as
the government has transfered new responsibilities to these
authorities without providing sufficient revenue, Fitch said in
the statement.  There will be “exceptionally high” pressure to complete
 capital expenditures  on roads, transport, water and waste
management projects co-funded by the European Union in
2012-2014, resulting in 50 billion zloty of outlays in 2012
alone, the ratings company said.  Such spending may increase Polish local and regional
governments’ debt by 10 percent to 15 percent next year from
about 62 billion zloty at the end of 2011, Fitch said.  The City of Warsaw’s 2014 Eurobond yield rose to 4.1013
percent today from 4.0956 percent yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
