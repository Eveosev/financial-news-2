Emerging-market stocks, especially
Brazil and India, are poised to “significantly underperform”
next year as commodity prices fall further, according to  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)   The  Continuous Commodity Futures Price Index (CCI) ’s drop below
key Fibonacci support “points to additional downside risk,”
Mary Ann Bartels, New York-based head of U.S. technical and
market analysis at Bank of America, wrote in a Dec. 19 note.
 Emerging markets  may be “negatively impacted by the break in
commodities,” she said.  The commodities index of 17 raw materials rose 0.4 percent
to 549.98 on Dec. 19, paring this year’s slump to 13 percent.
The measure is testing the 38.2 percent retracement near 550 of
a rally between December 2008 and April 2011, after falling
below the “uptrend support” near 570, Bartels said. The risk
is for a steeper decline toward the 50 percent and 61.8
retracements near the 507 and 463 levels, she said.  Speculators have reduced bets on commodities to a 31-month
low on concern that global economic growth is slowing. Money
managers cut combined net-long positions across 18 U.S. futures
and options by 9.6 percent to 532,521 contracts in the week
ended Dec. 13, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.  Funds are less bullish after Moody’s Investors Service said
it is reviewing  Europe ’s ratings and the  International Monetary
Fund  said the region’s fiscal crisis is “escalating.” Europe
accounts for 19 percent of global copper demand and consumes
about one in six barrels of the world’s oil.  Net Outflows  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  has tumbled 23 percent this
year as investors withdrew cash amid concern slowing global
growth will curb demand from exports. Developing-nation equity
funds posted outflows of $41.2 billion in 2011, the worst year
ever after 2008,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  strategists led by Geoffrey Dennis wrote in a Dec. 19 report. Shares in the gauge trade at
9.8 times estimated earnings.  Developing nations are among the world’s biggest exporters
of commodities.  Brazil (IBOV)  is the second-largest seller of soy and
iron ore, while India is the second-biggest exporter of cotton.  Cooling expansion in emerging markets will spur further
declines for raw materials, according to Michael Aronstein,
president of New York-based Marketfield Asset Management LLC,
who said in early May that commodities were entering a multiyear
 bear market .  Technical analysts look at price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines.
Fibonacci ratios are based on the sequence pioneered by 13th
century mathematician Leonardo Pisano and used to determine
highs and lows for prices and predict direction. They include
23.6, 38.2, 50, 61.8 and 76.4 percent moves.  “The biggest risk for 2012, in our view, is a continued
decline in emerging markets, particularly  Brazil  and India,”
Bartels said.  --Allen Wan in Shanghai. With assistance from Joe Richter.
