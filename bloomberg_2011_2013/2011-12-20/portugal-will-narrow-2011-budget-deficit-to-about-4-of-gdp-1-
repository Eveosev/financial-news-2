Portugal will narrow its  budget
deficit  to about 4 percent of gross domestic product this year
following the transfer of banks’ pension funds to the state,
Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said.  “Additional austerity measures are not necessary at the
moment,” Gaspar said today at a parliamentary commission in
Lisbon.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said last week that the
pension-funds transfer would help cut this year’s budget
shortfall to 4.5 percent of GDP or less. “If we did not have
extraordinary measures this year, our deficit would be very
close to 8 percent,” Passos Coelho said on Dec. 13.  The government had set a goal to trim the deficit from
9.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.9 percent in 2011 and to 4.5
percent next year. The 2012 budget includes a plan to eliminate
the summer and Christmas salary payments for state workers
earning more than 1,100 euros ($1,443) a month.  Tax deductions 
will be reduced and the government plans to increase the value-
added  tax rate  on some goods.  Passos Coelho is cutting spending and raising taxes to meet
the terms of a 78 billion-euro aid plan from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing
costs surged, Portugal followed Greece and Ireland in April in
seeking a bailout and now aims to return to bond markets in
2013.  The  Portuguese government  said on Dec. 2 that the value of
the planned transfer of banks’ pension funds to the state may
reach 6 billion euros. The government also announced a Christmas
income-tax surcharge to help cover the shortfall this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
