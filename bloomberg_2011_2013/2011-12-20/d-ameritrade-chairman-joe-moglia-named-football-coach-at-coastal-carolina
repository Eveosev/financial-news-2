TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD)  Chairman
Joe Moglia has been hired as football coach at  Coastal Carolina
University , after being president and coach of the  United
Football League ’s Omaha Nighthawks this season.  Moglia is the second football coach in the Conway,  South
Carolina , school’s history. He replaces  David Bennett , who was
63-39 in nine years at Coastal Carolina and was fired at the end
of the 2011 season when the Chanticleers finished 7-4.  Moglia, a former defensive coordinator with  Dartmouth
College , will remain with the UFL’s Nighthawks as president, the
UFL, a four-team professional league, said in an e-mailed
release.  Moglia, 62, is a former chief executive officer of Omaha, 
Nebraska-based TD Ameritrade, the third-largest U.S. retail 
brokerage by client assets.  “There are consistent words of praise from those whom I
have talked to about Joe such as ‘successful,’ ‘leadership,’
‘detail-oriented’ and ‘organized,’” Coastal Carolina Athletic
Director Hunter Yurachek said on the school’s website. “Most
importantly, it was made clear he has the skill set to be a
great head coach with a passion for molding student-athletes
into men.”  The Nighthawks finished 1-3 in the UFL. In addition to
Dartmouth, he worked two years as an adviser to  University of
Nebraska  coach Bo Pelini.  The Chanticleers began competing in the  National Collegiate
Athletic Association ’s Football Championship Subdivision in
2003. They are members of the Big South Conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
