The European Union said it is
confident that the 200 billion-euro ($261 billion) target in
added funding for the  International Monetary Fund  will be met.  “We are on the right track,” Olivier Bailly, spokesman
for the EU, told reporters in Brussels today. “The euro-area
member states delivered yesterday on their commitment and we
still have some work to do to meet the 200 billion target in the
coming weeks.”  “There was a clear understanding that out of this 200
billion contribution there was a first need to have a strong
contribution of 150 billion euros from the euro-area member
states, and this was achieved yesterday,” Bailly said.  “The discussion yesterday was not completely finalized,”
he said. “The  United Kingdom  decided to consider its possible
future contribution in the G-20 context.”  The euro-area finance ministers “put together a
contribution of 150 billion euros that will be put forward by
the national central banks of these member states using part of
their reserves in order to reinforce the IMF contribution to
support the euro-area financial stability,” Bailly said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
