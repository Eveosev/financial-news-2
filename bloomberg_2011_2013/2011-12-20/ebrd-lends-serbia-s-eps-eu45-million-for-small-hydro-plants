The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development approved a 45 million-euro ($59 million) loan to
Elektroprivreda Srbije,  Serbia ’s power monopoly, for renovating
and building small hydro plants.  The sovereign loan to the state-owned company is for
refurbishing 15 small plants of 18 megawatt combined capacity
and for building seven new ones on existing dams whose capacity
will total 13 megawatts, the London-based lender said in an e-
mailed statement.  Serbia’s Infrastructure Ministry said on Nov. 17 that the
EBRD suggested the country take the loan even though it was
close to a self-imposed debt limit of 45 percent of gross
domestic product. The EBRD statement today made no reference to
the debt issue. It said the investment in hydro facilities will
help cut Serbia’s carbon emissions by 60,000 tons a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
