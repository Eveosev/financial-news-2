Bayer AG (BAYN)  said four of its drugs in
development may become blockbusters, ultimately contributing 5
billion euros ($6.5 billion) to annual revenue.  Blood-thinner Xarelto has the brightest prospects, with
peak sales probably exceeding 2 billion euros a year,
Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer said in a statement on its
website today. Bayer’s eye drug VEGF Trap-Eye and cancer
medicines Alpharadin and regorafenib have billion euro
potential, the drugmaker said.  Bayer will allot two-thirds of next year’s 3 billion-euro
research and development budget to developing more new drugs,
the company said. Bayer needs new medicines to grow as its top-
selling multiple sclerosis treatment Betaseron faces competition
and contraceptives Yaz and Yasmin face safety-related lawsuits
in the U.S.  “Our pipeline is now beginning to bear fruit,” Chief
Executive Officer Marijn Dekkers said in the statement.  European authorities approved Xarelto for patients with an
irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation yesterday. The
drug, expected to compete with  Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH ’s
Pradaxa and Pfizer Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s Eliquis,
is already approved in the U.S., where Bayer markets Xarelto
together with Johnson & Johnson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
