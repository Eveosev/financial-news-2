Resumption of talks on financial aid
between  Hungary , the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund hinges on the government’s response to concerns
over a central bank law,  Vilaggazdasag  reported, citing an EU
official.  “It’s a fundamental issue whether the central bank law is
in line with EU charters and whether it guarantees the central
bank’s independence,” said Tamas Szucs, who heads the European
Commission’s Hungarian office, the newspaper reported.  Talks were suspended after the government submitted the
central bank law to parliament “despite our repeated requests
not to do so,” Szucs, who attended some of the meetings between
the three parties last week, told Vilaggazdasag.  The EU is awaiting the government’s response before
deciding on a possible date for resuming talks, the newspaper
cited Szucs as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
