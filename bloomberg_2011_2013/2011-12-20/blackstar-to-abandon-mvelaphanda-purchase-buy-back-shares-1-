Blackstar Group SE abandoned a bid
to buy South African  investment company   Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG) 
and said it will buy back its own shares after investors owning
more than 20 percent of Mvelaphanda opposed the plan.  Blackstar will repurchase as much as a 13.2 percent stake
to reduce the discount to net asset value its shares trade at,
the company said in a regulatory filing today. The Luxembourg-
based investment company offered as much as 1.9 billion rand
($230 million) in cash and stock for Mvelaphanda on Dec. 8.  “While it is naturally disappointing not to be proceeding
with the proposed acquisitions, Blackstar’s management is
committed to seeking new opportunities that will continue to
enhance value for Blackstar shareholders,” it said.  The company had secured support from Mvela Group’s largest
shareholder, Mvelaphanda Holdings Ltd., which owns 20 percent.
Shares in Mvelaphanda declined 2.3 percent to 3.40 rand by the
close in Johannesburg, paring an earlier loss of as much as 11
percent.  Mvela Group’s biggest assets are a 3 percent stake in  Absa
Group Ltd. (ASA) , Barclays Plc’s South African bank, and a 21.3
percent stake in  Avusa Ltd. (AVU) , the South African media company
that has a joint venture with the Financial Times and publishes
the nation’s largest weekend broadsheet newspaper.  Blackstar Executive Chairman Andrew Bonamour didn’t
immediately respond to a message left on his mobile phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
