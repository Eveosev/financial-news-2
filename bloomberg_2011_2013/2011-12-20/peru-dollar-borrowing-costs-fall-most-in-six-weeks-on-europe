Peru’s benchmark  borrowing costs  in
dollars fell the most in six weeks after an unexpected rise in
German business confidence boosted demand for higher yielding,
emerging market assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 216 at 11:37 a.m. Lima time, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. It was the biggest drop since Nov. 3.  The Munich-based Ifo institute’s business climate index
rose to 107.2 from 106.6 in November, after economists surveyed
by Bloomberg had forecast a drop to 106. Peru’s benchmark dollar
borrowing costs rose to a two-year high of 295 basis points
above Treasuries on Oct. 3 on concern the euro area’s debt
crisis will push European economies into recession.  “Data out of  Germany  shows that investor and consumer
confidence is withstanding the effects of the as-yet unresolved
debt crisis,” said  Roberto Flores , head of research at Inteligo
SAB, a Lima-based brokerage.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.73 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  The sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.6945 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
