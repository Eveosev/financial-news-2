Stion, a maker of thin-film solar
modules, got a $130 million equity investment led by Avaco Co.
and said it will form a “strategic partnership” with the South
Korean company to develop new equipment.  Stion is also establishing a Korean subsidiary to build a
module factory to serve Asian and European markets, the  San
Jose , California-based company said in a Business Wire release
today. It will initially fund the unit with $35 million.  The partnership with Avaco will help improve the conversion
efficiency of its thin-film panels, lower the cost and increase
the productivity of manufacturing equipment, Stion said.  Avaco joined current Stion investors, including Khosla
Ventures, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. and LightSpeed
Venture Partners, in the investment.  Stion will continue with a planned expansion of its U.S.
facility in Hattiesburg,  Mississippi , according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
