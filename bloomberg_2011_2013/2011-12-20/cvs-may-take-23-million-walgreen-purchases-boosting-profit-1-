CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS)  said the end of
 Walgreen Co. (WAG) ’s agreement to provide drugs for  Express Scripts
Inc. (ESRX)  customers may give it as many as 23 million prescription
sales and boost profit as much as 11 cents a share next year.
CVS shares advanced the most in more than three years.  Walgreen and Express Scripts, an employee-benefits manager,
have failed to replace a contract expiring at the end of the
year, putting about 90 million prescriptions up for grabs. CVS
may gain 16.9 million to 23 million prescriptions, the company
said in  slides  presented to analysts today.  The impasse “could present a very significant opportunity
for us,” CVS Chief Financial Officer Dave Denton told analysts
in  New York . “We think many customers are more likely to move
to another major chain.”  About 43 percent of CVS stores are within one mile of a
Walgreen drugstore and 85 percent are within five miles, CVS
said.  Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, won’t comment
on CVS’s projection, Michael Polzin, a company spokesman, said
today by e-mail. The Deerfield, Illinois-based company reports
first-quarter financial results tomorrow.  CVS’s projection for gaining 23 million prescriptions
assumes Walgreen would lose 85 percent of the prescriptions it
sells through Express Scripts and that CVS would get 30 percent
of those customers.  Drug Sales  CVS, based in Woonsocket,  Rhode Island , said it may earn
$3.15 a share to $3.25 a share in 2012. That forecast doesn’t
include possible benefits from the dispute between Walgreen and
 Express Scripts . Analysts projected $3.21, the average of 21
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Walgreen’s contract with Express Scripts is valued at more
than $5 billion in annual drug sales. The six-month dispute
revolves around how much St. Louis-based Express Scripts would
reimburse Walgreen.  CVS rose 8.9 percent to $39.80 at the close in New York,
the biggest advance since Oct. 30, 2008. Walgreen climbed 2.3
percent to $33.50.  -- Editors: Kevin Orland, James Callan  To contact the reporter on this story:
