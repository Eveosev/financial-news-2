Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said he is ‘very serious’ about the idea of selling the
country’s oil to markets in Asia, and that  Canada  no longer
wants to export its energy only to the United States.  “I am very serious about selling our oil off this
continent, selling our energy products off to Asia,” Harper
said in an interview with CTV National News broadcast last
night. He said that when “senior Americans” told him U.S.
lawmakers would approve  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL
pipeline, allowing Canada to sell all its oil to the U.S., he
replied, “We’d love to, but I think the problem is now that
we’re on a different track.”  Harper also said he didn’t see any likelihood of a joint
air mission to  Syria  similar to the one deployed over Libya, as
he didn’t think the United Nations Security Council would
authorize it, even amid growing economic and political pressure
on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to end the suppression of
protests that began in March.  “What really made the Libya mission possible was
ultimately a Security Council resolution that had authorized a
series of actions,” Harper said. “I don’t see that taking
place here. I don’t see the willingness of our allies to act
militarily without such a resolution,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
