Swiss Re Ltd. , the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, expects non- life insurance  premiums in
 emerging markets  to grow by 6.4 percent a year over the next
decade, more than twice as fast as in industrialized countries.  Non-life premiums will increase to $681 billion by 2021
while those for life insurance in emerging markets are expected
to grow 7.9 percent a year to $1.18 trillion over the same
period, the Zurich-based reinsurer said today. China will
“dominate” growth as the country becomes the second-biggest
insurance market after the U.S.  Emerging markets’ share of global life business will almost
double to 26 percent by 2021, from 14 percent last year, as
world economic growth is driven by  Asia  and other developing
nations, Swiss Re estimates in a  study . Their share of non-life
markets will rise to 22 percent from 16 percent.  “Riding on stronger economic performance and industry
catch-up dynamics, premium growth in emerging markets is
expected to continue to surpass that of industrialized countries
by a substantial margin in the next decade,” Swiss Re said.  Personal insurance, including auto and homeowner policies,
will benefit from a growing middle class, while the expansion of
manufacturing industry will increase sales to companies.  Boosting profitability in emerging markets will be
increasingly “challenging,” given the expectation for low
 interest rates , Swiss Re said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
