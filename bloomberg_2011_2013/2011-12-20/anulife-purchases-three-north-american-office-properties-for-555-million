Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ’s real
estate division bought three office properties in New Jersey,
California and Canada for about $555 million as it boosts its
holdings in North America.  The purchases include 10 Exchange Place, a 30-story tower
in Jersey City, New Jersey, that was acquired for $285 million,
and a four-building complex in Toronto that was bought for C$161
million ($156 million), the insurer said today in a statement.
It also purchased Seaview Corporate Center, a four-building
complex in  San Diego , for $109 million.  Investors are buying commercial property as they search for
higher yields than they may find on other assets, including some
fixed-income securities. Buyers have flocked to high-quality
real estate, such as office towers in major coastal cities, amid
increasing tenant demand.  The acquisition of 10 Exchange Place is Toronto-based
Manulife’s first investment in the New York metropolitan area.
The tower was built in 1988 and has views of lower  Manhattan  and
access to public transportation, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
