Lithuania’s  economy  may grow at half
the pace previously estimated next year on slowing export demand
and weakening consumer confidence, SEB Bank said.  SEB, the Baltic nation’s largest lender, cuts its 2012
economic growth forecast for the country to 2 percent from a 4
percent outlook in August, according to an e-mailed statement
today.  Lithuania’s export-led growth, the second-fastest in the
European Union after Estonia in the third quarter, is in peril
because of a deepening debt crisis in the euro area. The Baltic
nation’s economy, where exports account for about two-thirds of
output, expanded 6.7 percent in the third quarter.  The government’s plans to cut the  budget deficit  to within
3 percent of gross domestic product next year is “mission
impossible” and the shortfall will probably average 3.5 percent
next year, SEB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
