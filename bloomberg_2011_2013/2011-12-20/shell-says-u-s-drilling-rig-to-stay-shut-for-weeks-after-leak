Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil company, said a rig will stay shut for weeks after
spilling 319 barrels of drilling fluid into the  Gulf of Mexico .  The company suspended work at the Appomattox discovery,
which leaked synthetic and biodegradable drilling mud from a
booster line, Shell said. The leak was isolated, stopped and
remedial action has been approved by the regulator, it said. The
company temporarily abandoned the well.  Drilling will resume when Shell and relevant government
agencies “are confident that the necessary repairs have been
made and the operations can continue safely, which is likely to
be in a matter of weeks,” Jonathan French, a London-based
spokesman at the company, said in an emailed statement.  The Anglo-Dutch company was drilling the development well
following approval from the U.S. government of its two
exploration plans in May,  the first  since  BP Plc ’s spill in the
Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Shell holds 80 percent of the  Appomattox 
prospect with  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  of  Canada  holding the rest.  Shell and Nexen announced the discovery in the deepwater
eastern part of the Gulf in March 2010. The partners have partly
appraised the field and estimate that it holds more than 250
million barrels of resources, according to Nexen estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
