The Swedish krona climbed to its
strongest level in more than a week against the dollar after the
nation’s central bank signaled it may refrain from reducing
 interest rates  next year.  The krona climbed for a fifth day versus the euro, the
longest run of gains since February, even as the Riksbank cut
its seven-day repo rate by 25 basis points to 1.75 percent and
said it will average 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter of next
year. That’s down from a previous forecast of 2.3 percent.
 Norway ’s central bank reduced its main rate on Dec. 14 by a
more-than-expected 50 basis points, also to 1.75 percent.  “It’s more about the path than anything else,” said  Niels Christensen , chief currency strategist at Nordea Bank AB in
Copenhagen. “The move is a little bit more modest, more careful
than what we’ve seen from other central banks, so that’s also
another reason we’re not seeing a weaker krona.”  Sweden’s currency strengthened 1.3 percent to 6.8380 per
dollar at 4:01 p.m.  London  time, after appreciating to 6.8209,
the most since Dec. 12. It climbed 0.5 percent against the euro
to 8.9643, after climbing to its strongest level since Sept. 12.  The central bank’s decision was predicted by 11 of 24
analysts in a Bloomberg survey, while two said there would be a
half point reduction and the rest an unchanged rate.  The  Federal Reserve ’s target for overnight loans will stay
at 0.25 percent through 2012, while the  European Central Bank 
will probably cut its main rate to 0.75 percent, according to
Bloomberg surveys of economists.  ‘Pretty Messy’  Norway’s krone rose for a third day, gaining 0.2 percent to
7.7117 against the euro and was 1.1 percent stronger at 5.8808
versus the dollar.  “Things are pretty messy in the world around us and that
also affects the Swedish economy,” Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said in  Stockholm . “We expect that the rate will stay
around these levels at least through 2012 and a bit longer.”  The Riksbank rate path “implies only a small chance that
they cut rates again in 2012,” Elsa Lignos, a currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in London, wrote in a client
note today. “That has unwound rate-cut expectations” among
investors, she said in the report.  The krona gained 1.3 percent in the past week, the biggest
advance among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar slipped 1.1
percent, with the euro 0.5 percent lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
