The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today sued California-based Heart Tronics and six
individuals, including former pro football playerWillie Gault,
alleging fraud aimed at inflating the company’s stock.  The SEC said in a statement that Gault and former Hollywood
executive J. Rowland Perkins were named co-chief executive
officers and served mainly as figureheads in the company to
build investor confidence. Lawyer Mitchell Stein controlled most
of the company’s business activities and hired promoters to
praise Hert Tronics stock on the Internet, reaping almost $8
million from secret trades, according to the statement.  Gault and Perkins rarely questioned Stein’s fraudulent
activity and “abdicated” their responsibilities under the
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the SEC said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
