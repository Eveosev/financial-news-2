Spain’s central-government budget
gap narrowed in the first 11 months of 2011, boosting the
government’s chances of meeting its full-year deficit target.  The shortfall through November shrank to 52.4 billion euros
($68.5 billion), or 4.84 percent of gross domestic product, from
55.1 billion euros a year earlier, the  Finance Ministry  in
Madrid said in a statement today.  The government will probably meet its full-year deficit
target of 4.8 percent as revenue will rise and spending decline
in December, Deputy Finance Minister Juan Manuel Lopez Carbajo
told reporters in Madrid. The overall public-sector shortfall,
targeted at 6 percent this year, also includes regional balances
and the social-security system.  Prime Minister-elect  Mariano Rajoy , due to be sworn in
tomorrow, pledged to shrink the public sector and reduce
spending to tackle the euro area’s third-largest deficit. All
components of public spending may be reduced except pensions,
which will rise in January, he told Parliament in his inaugural
speech yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
