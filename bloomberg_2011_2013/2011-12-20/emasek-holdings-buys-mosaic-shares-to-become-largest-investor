Temasek Holdings Pte., Singapore’s
state-owned  investment company , increased its stake in  Mosaic
Co. (MOS)  to become the biggest shareholder of North America’s second-
largest fertilizer producer.  Temasek owns 17.9 million shares in Mosaic, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made
public today. The investment company owned 108,026 Mosaic shares
as of Sept. 30, according to a Nov. 14 filing. Temasek now owns
5.9 percent of the Plymouth, Minnesota-based company, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cargill Inc., formerly the biggest Mosaic shareholder, said
in January it was beginning a process to sell its 64 percent
stake in the fertilizer producer.  The Temasek stake is valued at $847.5 million, based on
Mosaic’s closing share price yesterday in New York.  Mosaic rose 5.4 percent to $49.93 at the close in New York.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. (POT)  is the largest fertilizer
producer by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
