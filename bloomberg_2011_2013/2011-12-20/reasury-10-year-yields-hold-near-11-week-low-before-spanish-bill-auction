Treasuries  fell, snapping a two-day
advance, as gains in Spanish and Italian  government bonds  and an
increase in German business confidence eased concern Europe’s
debt crisis is worsening, damping demand for refuge.  Thirty-year bond yields climbed from an 11-week low as data
showed builders in the U.S. broke ground in November on the most
houses in a year, adding to signs the world’s largest economy is
strengthening. The U.S. will sell $35 billion of five-year
securities today in the second of three note offerings this week
totaling $99 billion.  “The information out of Europe is good, and it led people
to think risk is on for today,” said  William O’Donnell , head
U.S. government bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc’s RBS Securities unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the Fed.  Yields on  30-year bonds  surged 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 2.91 percent at 11:38 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They touched 2.78
percent yesterday, the lowest level since Oct. 4. The 3.125
percent securities due in November 2041 dropped 2 15/32, or
$24.69 per $1,000 face amount, to 14 3/8. Benchmark 10-year note
yields gained nine basis points to 1.90 percent.  The 10-year  yield  has fallen 140 basis points in 2011, set
for the biggest annual decline since 2008. It tumbled to a
record 1.67 percent on Sept. 23.  German Confidence  Treasuries declined as German business confidence data
unexpectedly rose in December, damping bets that  Europe ’s two-
year-old debt crisis is weighing on growth. The Ifo institute’s
 business climate index  rose to 107.2 from 106.6 in November, the
Munich-based group said. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
forecast a drop to 106.  Spanish 10-year  yields touched a two-month low of 5.06
percent, down from 6.78 percent on Nov. 17, as the  European
Central Bank  offered unlimited three-year loans to the region’s
banks.  Spain  sold 5.64 billion euros ($7.4 billion) of the
three- and six-month bills, exceeding its maximum target of 4.5
billion euros. Italian two-year note yields fell for a fourth
day and reached 4.91 percent, the lowest since Oct. 31.  The ECB’s three-year loan operation, announced by bank
President  Mario Draghi  on Dec. 8, begins today and the results
will be announced tomorrow.  “Even though the European authorities haven’t addressed
the core issue of solvency, the liquidity  measures are starting
to gain traction at least in the mindset of the investing
public,” said RBS’s O’Donnell.  U.S. Housing  U.S.  housing starts  increased 9.3 percent to a 685,000
annual rate, the highest level since April 2010, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . Building permits,
a proxy for future construction, also climbed to a more than
one-year high.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 2.1 percent, and
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 1.2 percent. The euro
strengthened 0.9 percent to $1.3118.  The  difference in yield  between 10-year Treasuries and
inflation-protected debt, a measure of the outlook for consumer
prices over the term of the debt known as the break-even rate,
increased to as much as 2.0 percent, the widest since Dec. 14.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 2.6 percent, and
the euro strengthened 0.9 percent to $1.31018.  Ease in Pressure  “The Treasury market is trading lower this morning as
investors react to stronger-than-expected economic data” as
well as the Spanish auction,  Kevin Giddis , president of fixed-
income capital markets at the brokerage firm Morgan Keegan Inc.
in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , wrote in a note to clients. “We are
still a long way from a fix to Europe’s problems, but any ease
in funding pressures among member economies is certainly a
welcomed development.”  Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota
said he’s grown more optimistic about the economy after recent
data. He spoke in an interview on CNBC Television.  Richmond Fed President  Jeffrey Lacker  predicted the  U.S.
economy  will grow at least 2 percent next year and inflation is
likely to meet central bank goals.  “I am hard-pressed to see the rationale for any further
monetary stimulus,” Lacker told reporters yesterday. “Recent
economic news in the U.S. has been positive for a couple months
now.”  The Fed purchased $2.512 billion of Treasuries today due
from February 2036 to May 2041 as part of a plan announced in
September to replace $400 billion of shorter maturities in its
holdings with longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs and
support the economy.  Most Since 2008  Treasury 10-year notes have returned 17.7 percent this
year, headed for the biggest annual gain since 2008, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The overall Treasury
market has gained 10.1 percent, also headed for its biggest
annual return since 2008.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year notes
instead of five-years dropped to 100 basis points yesterday, the
least since Oct. 10. The spread was at 105 basis points today.  Five-year debt being sold today yielded 0.883 percent in
pre-auction trading, below the record low yield of 0.937 percent
at the last auction of the notes on Nov. 22.  The Treasury sold $35 billion of two-year notes yesterday
at a yield of 0.24 percent, the lowest since August. The U.S.
will sell $29 billion of seven-year securities tomorrow.  Today’s auction “will definitively be a test for the
market even as auctions over the past few weeks have been
extremely strong and there has been a clear underlying bid in
Treasuries,” Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at the
primary dealer Cantor Fitzgerald LP in  New York , wrote in a
client note. “We look for the concession to continue to be
built in prior to 1 p.m., with many still extremely cautious in
their bids.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
