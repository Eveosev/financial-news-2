The Egyptian central bank is
offering 20 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) in  repurchase
agreements , or repos, for the second straight week, as domestic
banks bear the brunt of financing the countryâ€™s budget deficit.  The contracts allow holders of  government securities  to
sell them back to the central bank to access funds for a week at
9.75 percent, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The
regulator accepted 20 billion pounds on Dec. 13, a record amount
since it introduced the facility this year.  The popular revolt that toppled former president  Hosni Mubarak  in February prompted foreign investors to cut their
holdings of Egyptian treasury bills, according to central bank
data. The government last week revised its target for the budget
deficit in the fiscal year through June 2012 to 10 percent of
gross domestic product, up from an earlier forecast of 8.6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
