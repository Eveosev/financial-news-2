Ukraineâ€™s sunflower oil production
will rise about 16 percent in the year started Sept. 1 after
sunflower yields increased, researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Crushers will produce a record 3.66 million tons of
sunflower oil, the Kiev-based researcher said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. This compares with 3.15 million tons
produced in the year which ended on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
