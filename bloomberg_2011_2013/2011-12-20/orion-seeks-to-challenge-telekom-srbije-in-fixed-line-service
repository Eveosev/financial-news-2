Orion Telekom DOO,  Serbia ’s second-
biggest internet provider that began fixed-line service, will
almost double investments next year to challenge Telekom Srbija
AD’s land-line dominance.  Orion will invest at least 10 million euros ($15.7 million)
next year to expand its fiber-optic network to about 70 percent
of Serbia’s 7.12 million people, said Director Slobodan Djinovic
in Belgrade today.  The Serbian unit of Netherlands-based Greenhouse
Telecommunications Holdings BV is aiming to expand in the 43.6
billion-dinar ($552 million) market. It obtained a national
fixed-phone license in 2010, ending a decades-long monopoly by
state-owned Telekom Srbija.  “Deregulation has taken place, but the actual end of a
monopoly can carry on for years,” Djinovic said. “In terms of
market share, a substantial change to the historic dominance”
of Telekom “may be seen only in 2013, 2014.”  The third participant in the market is  Telenor ASA (TEL) ’s local
 unit , the second-biggest provider of mobile services in Serbia,
which paid 1.05 million euros in 2010 for a fixed-line license.  Orion sales may rise more than 50 percent this year to 20.5
million euros, largely from its core activity, while revenue may
reach 25 million euros in 2012 on expanding its triple-play
cable offer that comprises internet, TV and telephone, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
