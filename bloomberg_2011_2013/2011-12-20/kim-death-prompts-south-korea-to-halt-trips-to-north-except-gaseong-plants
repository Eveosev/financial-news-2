South Korea  temporarily banned its
citizens from visiting  North Korea , except for a jointly-run
industrial park in Gaeseong, after the death of the communist
state’s leader  Kim Jong Il .  All planned visits including conferences on inter-Korean
historic sites and humanitarian aid-related trips have been put
on hold temporarily, Yoo Sun, an official at the Unification
Ministry in  Seoul , said by phone.  “We are not sure of when the visits will be allowed
again,” Yoo said.  A total of 940 South Koreans are still working at the
industrial complex, which is located about 10 miles (16
kilometers) inside North Korea, according to the Unification
Ministry.  Shares of South Korean companies with links or operations
at Gaeseong were mixed in trading today. Good People Co., an
underwear maker, fell 3.2 percent to 1,790 won while Romanson
Co., a watch maker declined 1.5 percent to 2,560 won.  Namkwang Engineering & Construction Co., which builds dams,
tunnels and airports, jumped 5.7 percent to 1,025 won after a
5.8 percent decline.  Kim died of a heart attack Dec. 17, the official Korean
Central News Agency said yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
