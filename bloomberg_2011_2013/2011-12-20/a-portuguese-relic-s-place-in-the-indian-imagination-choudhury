The word " India " is a kind of unicolored canopy thrown over an extraordinarily dense, diverse and tangled set of political histories, a behemoth threatening to drown out "the small voice of history" -- to borrow a phrase from the historian Ranajit Guha -- unless the little traditions find a way to assert themselves. Many Indians, especially those of my generation, were reminded of the necessity of disaggregating the threads of history this week when the state of  Goa  celebrated the 50th anniversary of its annexation by India. A small, sylvan territory on the west coast, now India's most popular tourist destination, Goa had an experience of colonial rule that was longer and very different from much of the rest of India. From the early 16th century onward, it came under the control of the Portuguese, who converted much of the local population to Catholicism and ruled much of the region for more than four and a half centuries as  Estado Português da Índia , or the Portuguese state of India. The encounter between the Portuguese and the indigenous population of Goa, while unmistakably marked by coercion and repression, also produced a distinctive culture, cuisine, architecture, and worldview that still makes Goa a standout out in modern India. As Vivek Menezes, the scholar of Goa, wrote in an essay in the magazine The Caravan earlier this month: Although India's anti-colonial movement in the first half of the 20th century had a ripple effect in Goa, the end of the British Raj in 1947 had no effect on the Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar, who continued to deploy a governor to rule the territory, leaving it, after 1954 --  when the French withdrew from their Indian territories  -- as the last colony on the subcontinent. Finally, in a controversial move, the government of  Jawaharlal Nehru , India's first prime minister,  took Goa by force  in a short, swift operation in December 1961. Two years later, in 1963, Goans voted in elections for the first time, and entered the narrative of Indian democracy by becoming the country's smallest state. But assimilation into India brought with it a fresh set of quandaries about identity, such as a movement within the state in the 1960s to have it incorporated into Maharashtra, the much bigger state  to its north , which also includes the metropolis of Mumbai, itself once a Portuguese holding subsequently handed over to the British. The core of the dispute revolved around language: Was  Konkani , the tongue widely spoken on the west coast of India and particularly in Goa, merely a dialect of Marathi, the language of Maharashtra, or was it an independent language? In an India that was being organized into new states  based on linguistic boundaries  -- a very full account of this reorganization can be found in the historian Ramachandra Guha's book "India After Gandhi" -- this was a vital question. The matter was finally decided, unusually, by a  referendum in 1967 . More than 54 percent of the people voted against merging with Maharastra. Fifty years after decolonization, it might be said that Goa is still coming to terms with its complex past and sometimes too-thin present, as interpreted through the sunglasses of Indian and foreign tourists. As the journalist Rajdeep Sardesai  wrote recently , "Brand Goa for the tourist is defined by plenty of sun, many beaches, all night bars, loud music, and the occasional rave party: basically, a chance to rid oneself of the inhibitions of middle class India without the neighbour complaining." Goans are seen by outsiders as pleasure-loving, laidback people who are fond of a tipple and a siesta and a jangle on the guitar. Sometimes this is too reductive and unlayered a narrative. (Only the need to share a laugh compels me to tell you a story about my friend Merwyn, a Goan baker who now lives in the suburb of Borivali in Mumbai. Last year, he embarked on his summer vacation to Goa leaving on the door of his shop the sign: "Closed For Summer Holidays: May 10-June???") Meanwhile, Portuguese, which was spoken by many Goans 50 years ago, has almost died out; the imperatives of an economy dependent on tourism mean that most people in the state have had to embrace Hindi, the closest thing to a national Indian language. The ambiguities of this situation were brought out in an essay by the Goan writer Frederick Noronha called " Liberation and its Discontents ": If only every Indian could attend at least a single session of a major conference being held this week at Goa University called " Goa: 1961 and beyond ." The event celebrates Goa's place in the history and imagination of at least three continents,  including Africa , and features, among others,  contributions  by the writer Damodar Mauzo ("How Liberated Is Goan Literature?"), the literary critic Rukmini Bhaya Nair, the historian R. Benedito Ferrao ("The Many Africas of Goa"), and the urban-studies scholars Rahul Srivastava and Matias Echanove ("The Portuguese Past in Contemporary Mumbai Villages..."). For the story of India to be kept alive in the greatest depth and density, so must the story of Goa. (Chandrahas Choudhury, a novelist, is the New Delhi correspondent for the World View blog.
