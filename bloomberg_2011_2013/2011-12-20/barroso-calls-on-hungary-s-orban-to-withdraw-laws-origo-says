European Commission President  Jose Barroso  called on Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  to
withdraw planned laws on the central bank and financial
stability, news website  Origo  reported, citing a letter from
Barroso that it obtained.  “I’d strongly encourage you to withdraw the two cardinal
laws that are now in front of parliament,” Barroso said,
according to Origo.  The European Union “has strong concerns” that the law on
the Magyar Nemzeti Bank goes against the bloc’s rules and
“problems” surrounding the two drafts led to the interruption
of talks between Hungary, the EU and the IMF earlier, according
to the letter, Origo said.  Peter Szijjarto , Orban’s spokesman, confirmed the receipt
of a letter from Barroso, adding that “we’re not entitled to
divulge its contents,” state news service MTI said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
