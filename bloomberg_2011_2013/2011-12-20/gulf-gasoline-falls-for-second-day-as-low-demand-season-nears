Gulf Coast  gasoline fell for a
second day against futures as traders prepared for less demand
after the holidays, when driving usually tapers off.  “We’re starting to enter the lower demand season,”  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said in a
telephone interview. “Gasoline demand during January and
February is seasonally the lowest of the year, and you’re also
starting to see impacts from some of the weather.”  There were heavy snowfalls in eastern Colorado and western
Kansas yesterday and a blizzard warning was posted today for the
northern Texas panhandle, the  National Weather Service  said.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline’s discount on the  Gulf
Coast  widened 1.13 cents to 6.13 cents a gallon versus futures
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:28 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 6.91 cents to
$2.5082 a gallon.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  New York Harbor 
widened 0.25 cent to 4 cents a gallon versus heating oil futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
