Russian billionaire  Mikhail
Prokhorov â€™s property development company,  OAO Opin , plans to
invest $450 million in high-rise apartment buildings,  Kommersant 
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Artemiy Krylov.  The company has shifted its focus from low-rise suburban
homes as demand for them has fallen, the Moscow-based newspaper
said. Opin will start building 270,000 square meters of high-
rise buildings in the Moscow region next year, Kommersant said
citing Krylov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
