Ukraine’s parliament extended a ban
on the sale of farmland for a year to January 2013, saying that
more time was needed to prepare the market for such sales.  Ukraine’s President  Viktor Yanukovych  wanted the land
market to start operating from January 2012.  The bill was backed by 275 lawmakers in the 450-seat
legislature in Kiev today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
