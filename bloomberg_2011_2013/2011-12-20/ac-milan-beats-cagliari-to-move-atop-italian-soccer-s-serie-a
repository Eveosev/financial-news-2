Defending champion AC Milan moved
atop Italian soccer’s Serie A with a 2-0 victory at Cagliari.  A Francesco Pisano own goal and strike from Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the 60th minute sealed the win last night to lift
Milan one point ahead of Juventus, which visits third-place
Udinese in one of today’s eight games. Serie A then breaks off
until Jan. 7.  In  France , Marseille beat Nancy 3-1 to break into the top
five and close the gap on leaders Montpellier and Paris Saint-
Germain to six points. Mathieu Valbuena, Stephane Mbia and Lucho
Gonzalez got the goals for the 2010 champion.  Montpellier and PSG, who both have 37 points atop the
standings, have away matches today. Ligue 1 then enters a 2 1/2-
week midseason break.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
