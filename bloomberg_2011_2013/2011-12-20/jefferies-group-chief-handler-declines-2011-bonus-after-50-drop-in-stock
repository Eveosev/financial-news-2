Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Handler  said he is among senior managers who
declined bonuses for fiscal 2011 after the firm’s stock dropped
more than 50 percent this year.  “We’ve given back our entire bonus,” Handler, 50, said
today on a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter earnings,
referring to himself and  Brian Friedman , chairman of the
executive committee. “We recognize our shareholders had a tough
year -- we’re shareholders, and we’re getting zero bonus.”  Handler, who receives a $1 million salary, didn’t say how
much money they turned down. His annual bonus can range from
zero to $12 million depending on performance, plus an incentive
equity award of as much as $13 million, according to a
description of the compensation program that the New York-based
firm filed with U.S. regulators in January.  The investment bank, which has been battling speculation
about its financial strength after MF Global Holdings Ltd.
collapsed, has slid 56 percent in New York trading this year
through yesterday.  Fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell 23 percent to $48.4
million as revenue decreased, the firm said today. The stock
rose today, paring the year’s slide, after earnings from fixed-
income trading recovered from the third quarter and as the firm
reduced assets 23 percent to $35 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
