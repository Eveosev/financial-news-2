AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  and  Novartis AG (NOVN)  said
drugs in late-stage development for depression and hypertension
failed in studies, prompting warnings about earnings and sales
forecasts.  AstraZeneca, based in London, said two experimental
medicines had disappointing results, leading to a $381.5 million
charge in the fourth quarter. Novartis of  Basel ,  Switzerland ,
said it stopped a test of its Tekturna heart drug for safety
reasons and the findings may hurt sales. Sanofi,  France ’s
biggest drugmaker, also said the Aubagio pill for multiple
sclerosis failed to beat an older therapy.  The loss of patent protection on medicines could wipe out
more than $21 billion in sales next year, with only $4 billion
being added from new products, Sam Fazeli and other analysts at
Bloomberg Industries wrote in a research note today.
AstraZeneca’s sales are projected to fall 8.4 percent in 2012,
while Novartis’s revenue may gain 1.3 percent and Sanofi’s 3
percent, according to the analysis.  “The bad results emerged at the same time, but Novartis
has been at the top of the leader board for drug launches over
the past decade, while AstraZeneca lies more toward the
bottom,” said  Gbola Amusa , an analyst at UBS AG in London. At
Sanofi, aside from the injectable Lemtrada drug for multiple
sclerosis, “and perhaps one or two other drugs, there isn’t a
lot else that’s cause for excitement in that pipeline.”  AstraZeneca shares fell as much as 3.3 percent in London
trading, the biggest intraday decline in six weeks, and were
down 2.4 percent to 2,877 pence at 1:05 p.m. Sanofi was little
changed at 53.68 euros in Paris, while Novartis fell 0.9 percent
to 52.35 Swiss francs in Zurich.  Bayer’s Blockbusters  Bayer AG (BAYN) , the German inventor of Aspirin, bucked the trend,
saying four of its drugs in development may become blockbusters,
ultimately contributing 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion) to annual
revenue. The shares rose as much as 2.9 percent in Frankfurt,
and were up 1.6 percent to 45.45 euros at 2:07 p.m.  Blood-thinner Xarelto has the brightest prospects, with
peak sales probably exceeding 2 billion euros a year,
Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer said in a statement on its
website today. Bayer’s eye drug VEGF Trap-Eye and cancer
medicines Alpharadin and regorafenib have blockbuster potential,
according to the drugmaker.  “Our pipeline is now beginning to bear fruit,” Chief
Executive Officer Marijn Dekkers said in the statement.  AstraZeneca, the U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker, said core
earnings per share for the year will probably be “in the lower
half” of a $7.20 to $7.40 forecast, which remains unchanged
after the research setbacks.  AstraZeneca’s Misfortune  “AstraZeneca seems to have had more than its fair share of
misfortune when it comes to the development pipeline,” analysts
at  Barclays Capital  in London wrote in a note to investors
today. “Additional development failures increase the
probability that management will reassess the likely return on
investment from additional R&D investment and cut costs
further.”  The drug Olaparib for ovarian cancer won’t move to the
final stage of clinical trials and an advanced study of another
medicine for patients with major depressive disorder, TC-5214,
failed to meet the main goal of a study, AstraZeneca said
earlier today in a statement. The company needs new products to
replace revenue lost as patents expire on older medicines. The
patent protection on the company’s Arimidex and Casodex cancer
drugs expired last year.  “It’s a setback in a pipeline that’s already relatively
thin, at a company that does need pipeline products because of
the patent expiries on the horizon,”  Alistair Campbell , an
analyst at Berenberg Bank in London, said by phone today.
“There are still some pipeline options, though I have to say my
hopes aren’t high for many of those.”  Promising Drugs  Two drugs that show promise are fostamatinib for rheumatoid
arthritis and dapagliflozin for diabetes, Campbell said. U.S.
regulators in October delayed a decision on dapagliflozin by
three months.  Novartis said patients who took Tekturna along with two
standard high blood-pressure treatments in the trial, dubbed
Altitude, experienced more non-fatal strokes and kidney
complications. The company will stop promoting Tekturna, also
known as Rasilez, in combination with those two types of drugs
as a “precautionary measure.”  The setback with Tekturna, which was being studied in
diabetics with renal impairment, may hurt sales of the medicine,
the Swiss company said today in a statement. Revenue from
Tekturna, which was first approved in 2007, was $449 million in
the first nine months of the year.  Pill vs Injection  Sanofi said its experimental pill Aubagio failed to beat
Merck KGaA’s injected therapy Rebif at preventing relapses or
keeping patients on treatment.  Almost half of the patients receiving the lower dose of
Aubagio either had a relapse or stopped taking the drug,
compared with 37.8 percent at the higher dose and 42.3 percent
for Rebif patients, Sanofi said. Annual relapse rates weren’t
distinguishable between those taking Rebif and those taking the
higher dose of Aubagio, and was higher in the low-dose group,
the company said.  The Tenere trial is the second completed study of five
planned for Aubagio in MS, Sanofi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
