Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) ’s creditors
are demanding it sell at least a 10 percent stake in  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , with 15
percent of the banks being in favor of execution
of the guarantees on the loan Sacyr took to buy its 20 percent
stake in the Spanish  oil company ,  Expansion  reported, without
citing sources.  One of the Sacyr board members proposed threatening the
creditor banks with a pre-bankruptcy filing which would prevent
execution of guarantees, Expansion reported. The Sacyr board
faces potential lawsuits for failure in its fiduciary duty
should it sell the Repsol stake at a disadvantageous price, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
