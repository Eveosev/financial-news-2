No current executive of  Sprott Inc. (SII) 
was behind an 820,600-share trade last week that occurred as the
Toronto-based  money manager  was falling the most in almost three
years, Chief Financial Officer Steve Rostowsky said.  Sprott Inc., founded by  Eric Sprott , plunged 12 percent to
C$5.35 on Dec. 16, as 1.09 million shares were sold. A single
trade accounted for 820,600 shares. The stock has climbed 5.6
percent to C$5.65 this week.  “To the best of my knowledge,” no one still associated
with Sprott Inc. sold the shares Dec. 16, Rostowsky said in a
telephone interview.  Three other shareholders own enough shares to have carried
out such a sale, Rostowsky said. They are Peter J. Hodson and
J.F. Tardif, both former Sprott money managers, and Royce &
Associates LLC.  Reached at his Toronto residence, Tardif said today he
didn’t sell the shares. Hodson didn’t return phone calls placed
to his cellphone. W. Whitney George, co-chief investment officer
of Royce, a New York-based money-management company, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
