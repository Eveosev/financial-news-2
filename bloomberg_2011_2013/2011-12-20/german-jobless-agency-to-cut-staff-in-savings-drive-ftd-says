Germany â€™s jobless-benefits agency
plans to cut 17,000 of its 114,000 employees by 2015, reducing
annual costs by 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion), the Financial
Times Deutschland said, citing an interview with agency head
Frank-Juergen Weise.  The savings are possible because German unemployment is
declining, the newspaper  reported  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
