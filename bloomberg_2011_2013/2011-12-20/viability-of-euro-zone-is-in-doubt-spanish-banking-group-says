The crisis facing the  euro zone  is
severe enough to put the bloc’s survival into doubt, while
Spain’s economy is in a “critical” situation, the country’s
 banking association  said.  “The euro-zone crisis has acquired an extraordinary
seriousness to the extent that it puts into doubt its own
viability,” the group, known as AEB, said in its December
 economic report .  Policy makers should could consider issuing bonds backed by
all nations using the euro, allow the  European Central Bank  to
act as a lender of last resort and count on International
Monetary Fund assistance for countries in difficulties, the
report said. The  AEB  represents 93 Spanish and foreign banks
operating in Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
