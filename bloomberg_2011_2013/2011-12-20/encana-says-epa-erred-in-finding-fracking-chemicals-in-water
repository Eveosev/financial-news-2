Encana Corp. (ECA) , Canada’s largest
natural-gas producer by volume, said the U.S.  Environmental
Protection Agency  made errors when it reported that chemicals
used in extracting gas through hydraulic fracturing were found
in a drinking-water aquifer in Wyoming.  The EPA’s study didn’t take into account naturally
occurring chemicals in deep wells in the area and the
possibility that unset cement from the agency’s own test well
may have contaminated water samples, said  David Stewart ,
Encana’s environment, health and safety lead in the region, in a
conference call today.  “We plan to investigate this further with our in-house and
external investigators,” said Stewart.  The U.S. gets about one-third of its gas from fracturing,
known as fracking, in which millions of gallons of chemically
treated water and sand are forced underground to break rock and
let trapped vapor flow. The EPA’s findings from Dec. 8 give
ammunition to environmental groups, such as the  Natural
Resources Defense Council , that have said the drilling risks
tainting drinking water and needs stronger regulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
