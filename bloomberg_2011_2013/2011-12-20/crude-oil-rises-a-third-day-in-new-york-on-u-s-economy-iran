Oil climbed for a third day in  New
York  as investors bet that fuel demand may increase amid signs
of an economic recovery and declining stockpiles in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest crude consumer.  Futures advanced as much as 1.2 percent after data from the
 American Petroleum Institute  showed  crude inventories  dropped to
the lowest in almost two years. The  Energy Department  today may
say supplies fell 2.13 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg
News survey. The February contract surged 3.4 percent yesterday
on U.S. housing data that beat estimates, unexpected growth in
German business confidence and indications that shipments from
 Iran  may be curbed.  “Economic data is painting a better global growth
scenario, and that’s clearly feeding into firmer  oil prices ,”
said  Michael McCarthy , a chief market strategist at CMC Markets
Asia Pacific Pty in Sydney who predicts New York futures will
settle between $99 and $102 a barrel at the end of the year.
“We’ll be watching the inventory data tonight following the
API.”  Crude for February delivery rose as much as $1.20 to $98.44
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $98.12 at 3:53 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday climbed $3.19 to $97.24. Front-month futures
are up 9.2 percent this year after gaining 15 percent in 2010.  Brent oil for February settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange rose as much as 84 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $107.57 a barrel. The European benchmark contract
was at a premium of $9.35 to New York-traded West Texas
Intermediate grade. The spread was a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Oil Stockpiles  U.S. crude inventories fell to 330 million barrels last
week, the lowest since the period ended Jan. 22 last year, the
industry-funded API said yesterday.  Gasoline stockpiles decreased 394,000 barrels to 213.9
million, based on the API data. The Energy Department report may
show supplies probably climbed 1.5 million barrels, according to
the  median estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Distillate-fuel stockpiles, including heating oil and diesel,
are expected to have declined 750,000 barrels.  The Energy Department will release its weekly report at
10:30 a.m. in  Washington  today.  Oil in New York has technical resistance along the middle
Bollinger Band, around $98.20 a barrel today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sell orders tend to be clustered near
chart-resistance levels.  Housing Starts  Home builders in the U.S. broke ground in November on more
houses than at any time in the past 19 months.  Housing starts 
increased 9.3 percent to an annual rate of 685,000, the highest
since April 2010, a Commerce Department report showed yesterday.
A median 635,000 gain was forecast by 79 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The Ifo institute’s  business climate index  in  Germany ,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, rose in November, the
Munich-based group said yesterday. Economists predicted a drop,
a Bloomberg News survey showed. Germany is Europe’s largest
economy.  Iran, the second-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi Arabia , will probably
stockpile more crude at sea as foreign buyers avoid the
country’s oil amid the prospect of renewed international
sanctions, according to JBC Energy GmbH, a Vienna-based
consultant.  European Union foreign ministers are scheduled to meet next
month to discuss possible sanctions on Iranian oil supplies. The
U.S. approved new restrictions on the country’s oil industry and
banking system Nov. 21 to deter buyers of Iranian crude and
thwart its nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
