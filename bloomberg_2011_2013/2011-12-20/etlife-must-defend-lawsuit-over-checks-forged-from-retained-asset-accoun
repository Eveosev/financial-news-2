MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, must defend a lawsuit by the beneficiary of a policy
who claimed the insurer paid $302,000 to the wrong person.  The suit was filed by Jose Herrera, who lived with his
wife, Maria Diaz, until she died in 2006. Diaz had been covered
by a U.S. program under which MetLife provided insurance to
federal employees. When Diaz died, MetLife paid proceeds of her
policy into a so-called retained asset account, in which MetLife
kept custody of funds while issuing a checkbook to the
beneficiary.  Herrera sued MetLife after learning that Diaz’s daughter by
a prior marriage had allegedly forged his signature to a claim
form and told MetLife to send the checkbook to the daughter’s
home. MetLife wouldn’t make payments to Herrera, the beneficiary
of Diaz’s policy, after the daughter allegedly forged Herrera’s
name to $302,820 in checks, according to the complaint.  U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan  in New York yesterday
rejected MetLife’s bid to dismiss the suit by Herrera, who said
MetLife failed to exercise “reasonable caution” before issuing
the checkbook. “Herrera simply claims monies allegedly due to
him by virtue of the contract between the government and MetLife
of which Diaz availed herself,” Kaplan said in an opinion.  MetLife is among more than 100 insurance carriers that earn
investment income on billions of dollars owed to life insurance
beneficiaries, Bloomberg Markets magazine reported last year.  John Calagna , a spokesman for the New York-based insurer,
declined to comment on the ruling.  “I’m pleased with the judge’s decision,” Eric Wertheim, a
lawyer for Herrera, said in a statement.  Appellate Decision  Kaplan didn’t rule on the merits of Herrera’s claims. Among
its legal arguments, MetLife said Herrera hadn’t alleged enough
facts for the suit to proceed.  In August, a federal appeals court in  New York  ruled that
MetLife’s use of retained asset accounts didn’t violate a
fiduciary duty owed to beneficiaries of policies issued under
employee-benefit plans.  The beneficiaries argued that they were entitled to the
full amount that insurers earn by investing the retained assets.
Insurers said beneficiaries were entitled only to the amount
they have been guaranteed under contracts.  The case is Herrera v. MetLife, 11-cv-1901, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ). The appellate
case was Faber v. MetLife, 09-4901, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals (New York).  To contact the reporter on this story:
