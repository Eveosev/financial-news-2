Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ,  Canada ’s largest oil-
pipeline company, has won enough support from shippers to
proceed with a $1.9 billion project to bring more Canadian and
 North Dakota  crude to U.S. refineries.  The Gulf Coast Access project would be a new pipeline from
their terminal in Flanagan, Illinois, to Cushing, Oklahoma, in
service by mid-2014, the Calgary-based company said in a
statement today. The pipeline will connect with the Seaway
system to carry oil to Gulf Coast facilities.  Enbridge proposed the pipeline system to handle increased
production from Canada’s oil sands as well as the Bakken region
in North Dakota and Montana. The line will follow rights of way
for Enbridge’s existing Spearhead system.  “The Gulf Coast Access project offers near-term solutions
through the cost-effective and efficient use of existing
facilities and rights of way,” Stephen Wuori, Enbridge’s
president of liquids pipelines, said in the statement.  The Seaway line, which is being reversed, will operate with
a capacity of 150,000 barrels a day by the second quarter of
2012, Enbridge and  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  said in a
separate statement today. Pump modifications expected by early
2013 will boost that to 400,000 barrels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
