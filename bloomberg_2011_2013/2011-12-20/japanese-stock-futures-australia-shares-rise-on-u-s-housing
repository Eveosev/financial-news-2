Japanese  stock (MXAP)   futures  and
Australian equities rose after U.S. housing starts increased
more than economists forecast, adding to optimism the world’s
largest economy will weather Europe’s debt crisis.  American depositary receipts of  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s
second-largest carmaker by market value, rose 1.6 percent from
the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , a
Japanese trading company, also gained 1.6 percent after
commodity prices advanced. BHP Billiton Ltd., Australia’s
biggest oil producer, jumped 2.6 percent after crude prices
increased.  Futures (TPX)  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 8,460 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,330 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,460 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200  Index (CRY)  gained 2
percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added 0.7 percent.  “The U.S. is showing it’s fairly robust in terms of not
being dragged down to the extent of European economies, but
there remain significant structural impediments,” said Tim Schroeders, who helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana
Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “There will be significant gains
today. A question is, given we are coming into a holiday period,
how sustainable those gains are going to be over the next week
or so.”  U.S. Housing  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index advanced 3 percent in New York
yesterday after a report showed builders broke ground in
November on 685,000 houses, the most since April 2010. Concern
about  Europe ’s debt crisis eased after Spain sold 5.64 billion
euros ($7.38 billion) of bills, more than the maximum target,
and German business confidence unexpectedly grew.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 19 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 1.3 percent loss by the S&P
500 and a 14 percent decline by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.6 times for the S&P 500
and 10.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese equities traded in New York rose the most in two
weeks, led by solar energy stocks, after the Asian nation
pledged funding support for small companies and as U.S. and
German economic data that topped forecasts eased concern the
global economy may be headed into a recession.  The Bloomberg China-U.S. 55 Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks rose 2.8 percent to 94.88 at 2:36 p.m. New York
time, the biggest gain since Nov. 30.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index  of raw materials
gained 2 percent yesterday. Crude for January delivery gained
