Growth in wine sales by the leading
five auction houses slowed to about 14 percent this year from 75
percent in 2010 as the global financial crisis cooled demand for
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and other top Bordeaux producers.  Sales by Acker Merrall & Condit, Christie’s International,
 Sotheby’s (BID) , Zachys and Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. still achieved a
record of about $405 million this year, helped by a late flurry
of activity this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
News. That total compares with $353.7 million in 2010.  While Hong Kong accounts for half of the global auction
market, buoyed by Chinese appetite for top Bordeaux and rare
Burgundies, expansion in the market has slowed. Asian buyers
have become unwilling to pay ever-higher auction records for
First Growths such as Lafite, and they also balked at Bordeaux’s
ambitiously priced 2010 “en primeur” campaign. The benchmark
 Liv-ex 100 Fine Wine Index  is down 11.4 percent this year.  “It feels a lot more than that,”  Simon Staples , the Hong
Kong-based head of sales and marketing at London wine broker
 Berry Bros & Rudd  said in an interview. “Prices for some First
Growths such as Lafite ’08 have dropped off by more than 40
percent and haven’t reached the bottom yet. Our clients are
looking instead at Bordeaux Second Growths and the top 10 names
in Burgundy.”  Prices for Lafite, which soared to bubble levels for some
vintages in the past two years as Chinese demand propelled bids
higher, showed signs of peaking in the final quarter of 2010.  Lafite Vintage  A case of  Lafite-Rothschild  1982 fetched a record HK$1.03
million ($132,700) at a Sotheby’s auction in  Hong Kong  in
October last year, while another case of the same vintage sold
for HK$720,000 at a Christie’s sale in the same city the
following month.  Since then, auction prices for the vintage have fallen to
less than half that level as the financial crisis has curbed
spending and collector attention has switched more to Burgundy.
A case of Lafite 1982 sold for just 23,000 pounds ($36,100) at
Sotheby’s in London on Dec. 7.  Acker  kept its global leadership of the auction market,
reporting total sales for the year, including internet business,
of $110.45 million.  Christie’s  auctions are up 30 percent at about $92 million,
according to Bloomberg calculations, including the $7 million
Hospices de Beaune charity auction, and Christie’s itself has
confirmed its sales were “in the region of $90 million.”  New York-based Sotheby’s says it sold $85.47 million
worldwide during this year.  Hong Kong Sales  Acker has established itself as market leader in Hong Kong,
with its 2011 sales of $69 million in the city accounting for
close to one third of the local auction market. Sotheby’s,
Zachys and Christie’s have also expanded in the territory and
all achieved sales in excess of $40 million there this year.  Zachys , whose global sales surged 40 percent in 2011, and
Acker were leaders in the  New York  market this year, while
Christie’s led overall in  Europe , Sotheby's in London auctions
and  Hart Davis Hart  in  Chicago .  “This year’s increase in a falling market shows that
exceptional auction lots still attract the money,” said  Peter
Lunzer , founder of London-based Lunzer Wine Investments. “There
are still wealthy people out there and for them these amounts
are pretty insignificant.”  Acker’s auction in Hong Kong on Dec. 8 and 10 included a
lot of 55 bottles of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti’s signature
Romanee-Conti wine in vintages ranging from 1952 through 2007.
It sold at the upper end of its estimate for HK$6.34 million to
a Chinese bidder on the telephone. The price was the highest
achieved for a single lot at any wine auction this year, as well
as a salesroom record for a Romanee-Conti item.  Burgundy Demand  Romanee-Conti’s 1990 vintage topped both Christie’s and
Sotheby’s final wine auctions of the year in  London  on Dec. 1-2
and Dec. 7 respectively. An Asian bidder paid 115,000 pounds for
12 bottles at  Christie’s , while a U.K. dealer secured a case at
 Sotheby’s  for 82,800 pounds. Cases of the more tannic 1988
vintage commanded prices of 63,250 pounds and 62,100 pounds
respectively at the same auctions.  Romanee-Conti, Burgundy’s premier wine, is made out of
grapes from a vineyard measuring just 4.3 acres. “Burgundy has
enormous potential for price increases,” said Lunzer. “The
problem is getting hold of it. In the meantime, it’s become
easier to buy Bordeaux in a falling market and I expect the Liv-
ex 100 to climb back up by May 2012.”  Other auction houses active in the wine market include
Winebid.com,  Spectrum  and  Bonhams . The first two operate over
the internet, with Spectrum also holding live sales in Hong
Kong, while Bonhams sells in London, Hong Kong, New York and
 California . The global trade in fine wine, of which auctions
represent just a part, is worth about $4 billion, according to
Liv-ex.  (Guy Collins and Scott Reyburn write about the art market
