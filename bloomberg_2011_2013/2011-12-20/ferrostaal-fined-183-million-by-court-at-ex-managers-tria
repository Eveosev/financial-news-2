Ferrostaal AG was fined 140 million
euros ($183 million) today by a Munich court in a bribery case
related to the conduct of two former employees.  The fine is the result of an agreement between the company,
prosecutors and the judges, court spokeswoman Margarete Noetzel
said in an e-mailed statement. The sanction was issued as part
of a verdict in the trial of two former company managers accused
of paying bribes in Greece and  Portugal .  Ferrostaal  said  at the beginning of the trial on Dec. 15
that it was willing to pay the fine, which was the result of
“intensive negotiations.” The company said in a statement
today that it would bear the consequences and pay the fine.  The two former company managers, identified only as Johann-
Friedrich Ha., 73, and Hans-Dieter Mue., 73, were convicted of
bribery and received suspended prison terms of two years. Ha.
was also fined 36,000 euros and must pay 30,000 euros to
charities to have the term suspended. Mue. was fined 18,000
euros and must pay 22,000 to charities, according to the
statement.  Prosecutors had been probing Essen, Germany-based
Ferrostaal, which manages the development of industrial and
petrochemical plants, since 2009 to determine whether it bribed
officials for contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
