Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the iPhone and iPad
maker that has $81.6 billion in cash and investments, will
probably issue a “significant” dividend next year, according
to Howard Ward of Gamco Investors Inc.  While the company has increased net income every year since
at least 2002, Cupertino, California-based Apple hasn’t paid out
cash to shareholders. The stock has jumped 53-fold since the end
of 2002 after former Chief Executive Officer  Steve Jobs 
transformed the Mac maker into a producer of mobile phones and
tablet computers. Jobs, who died in October, was replaced as CEO
in August by  Tim Cook .  “We’re going to see a dividend announced for Apple at some
point in the first half of 2012,” Ward, a  money manager  who
helps oversee about $36.1 billion for Gamco Investors Inc., said
in an interview today with “Street Smart” on Bloomberg
Television. “That could easily be a 3 percent dividend-yielding
stock or even higher.”  Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment.  “I’m not religious about holding cash or not holding it,”
Cook said during an Oct. 18 conference call with analysts. “The
cash that we do spend, we’re doing an extremely good job of it
and we’re very frugal about using it and using it in the right
places.”  Apple surpassed Redmond, Washington-based  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 
as the world’s biggest technology company by market value in
2010. Microsoft paid its first dividend in 2003 and now has a
yield of 3.13 percent, compared with 2.20 percent for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Apple has rallied 18 percent in 2011. That contrasts with
the rest of the  S&P 500 , where the worst stocks this year were
the savers and the best gave the money back to investors with
dividends and buybacks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Companies that hoarded cash such as  CareFusion Corp. (CFN) ,
Western Digital Corp. and 18 other members of the S&P 500 lost
an average 15 percent in 2011, the data show. The 40 that
repurchased the most stock or offered the biggest dividends
climbed 5.7 percent, led by DirecTV and Reynolds American Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
