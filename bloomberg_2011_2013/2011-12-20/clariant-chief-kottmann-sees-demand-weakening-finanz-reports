Clariant AG (CLN)  sees demand weakening in
various areas of the chemicals market, Chief Executive Officer
Hariolf Kottmann told  Finanz und Wirtschaft  in an interview.  The company’s order backlog is “still high,” Kottmann
told the Swiss newspaper in the interview to be published
tomorrow, adding that he expects the company to do well in a
downturn because 50 percent of its business is “more or less
resistant” to swings in economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
