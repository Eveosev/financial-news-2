Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  rose for a
second time this week, gaining 0.8 percent to 1,107.73 at the
4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The measure has dropped 16 percent
this year. Investors traded about 1.1 billion shekels ($291
million) of shares and convertible securities, according to
bourse data.  The following stocks advanced or fell today. Symbols are in
parenthesis.  Ampal-American Israel (AMPL)  Corp slumped 11 percent,
the most since Aug. 10, to 1.196 shekels. The owner of a 12.5
percent stake in the company that exports gas from  Egypt  to
Israel on a pipeline that has been attacked 10 times this year,
said yesterday it would meet with debt holders to discuss a two-
year postponement in the principal payment of some bonds.  Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (GILT)   rose the most in
almost two weeks, gaining 1.8 percent to 14.67 shekels. The
provider of satellite-networking technology said it got a
contract estimated at $18.5 million to provide Internet
connectivity for schools in Colombia.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  , the world’s
largest generic-drug maker, declined the most since Nov. 20,
retreating 2.3 percent to 159.10 shekels, or the equivalent of
$42.09. The generic version of the Lipitor drug that Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. started selling in the U.S. this month
achieved a market share of 9 percent, according to Wolters
Kluwer. Teva will receive a portion of the profits for the first
six months, under the terms of an agreement between the two
companies.  “Teva’s weakness reflects investors’ disappointment from a
lower-than-expected market share of the generic Lipitor since
its launch,” said Jonathan Kreizman, an analyst in  Tel Aviv  at
Clal Finance Brokerage.  The U.S.-traded shares declined 2.4 percent to $41.71
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
