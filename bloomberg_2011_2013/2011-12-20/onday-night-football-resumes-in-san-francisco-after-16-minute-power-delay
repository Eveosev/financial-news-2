The Monday Night Football game in
 San Francisco  between the 49ers and the Pittsburgh Steelers has
resumed after a 16-minute interruption caused by the second
power outage of the evening.  The game was halted early in the second quarter with the
49ers leading 6-0.  The contest began 20 minutes late because a transformer
blew outside the stadium, plunging  Candlestick Park  into
darkness.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
