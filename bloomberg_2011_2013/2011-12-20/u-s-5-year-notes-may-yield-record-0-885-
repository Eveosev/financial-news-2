The Treasury’s $35 billion sale of
five-year notes may draw a record low yield of 0.885 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in December 2016, yielded
0.891 percent in pre-auction trading. The record low auction
yield of 0.937 percent was reached last month. The highest five-
year auction yield in 2011 was 2.26 percent at the March sale.
Bids for today’s sale are due by 1 p.m. New York time.  Today’s offering is the same size as the past 15 monthly
five-year debt auctions.  The November five-year sale’s bid-to-cover  ratio , which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 3.15. The average ratio at the past 10 offerings
was 2.85.  Indirect bidders,  an investor category that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 45.3 percent of the notes at
the November offering, compared with the 10-auction average of
42.1 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealers that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, bought 9.6 percent of the securities
at last month’s offering. That compares with an average of 11.2
percent at the past 10 sales.  Five-year notes have returned 9.2 percent this year,
compared with a 10.1 percent gain for the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Second of Three  Today’s auction is the second of three note sales totaling
$99 billion this week. The U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year
notes yesterday and will auction $29 billion of seven-year
securities tomorrow.  There are $58.2 billion of coupon securities maturing this
week, so the week’s note auctions will raise $40.8 billion of
new cash, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Treasury has
raised $354.7 billion of new cash this fiscal year, which
started Oct. 1, compared with $1.1 trillion last fiscal year.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in U.S. debt auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
