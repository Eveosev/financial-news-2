Colombia  plans to raise less money
in the local  bond market  next year, and expects its 2012 budget
deficit to narrow more than it originally expected, as strong
economic growth boosts tax revenue.  Colombia plans to auction 18.4 trillion ($9.3 billion) of
peso bonds next year, according to a revised 2012 financing plan
announced today by Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry. In
June, the government forecast it would need to raise 20 trillion
pesos in the local market. The consolidated budget deficit,
which includes states, municipalities and state-run companies,
should fall to 1.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2012
from a projected 2.9 percent of GDP this year, Echeverry said.  “The economy has been very dynamic,” Echeverry told
reporters today in Bogota. “We are reducing our deficit even as
we invest more.”  Quickening economic growth and rising foreign direct
investment are bolstering tax revenue and reducing the
government’s financing needs. Echeverry said today that tax
collection surged 25 percent to 84 trillion pesos this year.  Latin America ’s fifth-largest economy may grow as much as 6
percent in 2011, the fastest pace since 2007, according to the
central bank. Echeverry said today that Colombia’s economy may
grow 5.1 percent in 2012.  Overseas Bonds  The strong growth, more than investment-grade rivals Brazil
and  Mexico , has given the government a “healthy amount” of
cash holdings to pay for bonds maturing overseas at the
beginning of next year, Echeverry said. The government is in no
hurry to sell $3 billion of bonds it plans to issue overseas in
2012, he added.  A military offensive against guerrilla groups has increased
security in the last decade in the Andean nation, opening up
vast swathes of the countryside for companies to explore for
oil, coal and gold. Foreign direct investment may reach a record
$12 billion this year, up from $9.5 billion in 2010, central
bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said Nov. 11.  Congress in June passed legislation, known as the fiscal
rule, that will allow the nation to capitalize on the resource
boom, cut its  budget deficit  and create a fund to cushion the
economy during crises. It targets a central government budget
deficit of no more than 2.3 percent of gross domestic product in
2014 and 1.9 percent of GDP in 2018.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 has fallen 56 basis points so far this year to 7.6
percent. The peso has dropped 1.4 percent this year to 1,934.25
per  U.S. dollar .  Colombia is targeting a central government budget deficit
next year equal to 3 percent of GDP, Echeverry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
