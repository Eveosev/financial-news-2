Immofinanz AG (IIA)  gained the most in
more than 18 months in Vienna trading after eastern  Europe ’s
biggest property developer said second-quarter profit rose more
than fourfold on favorable exchange rates and higher rental
income.  The shares closed 6 percent higher after the Vienna-based
company said in a  report  today that net income jumped to 233.6
million euros ($305 million), or 21 cents a share, in the three
months ended Oct. 31 from 49.5 million euros, or 5 cents, a year
earlier. Rental income increased 2.3 percent to 141.6 million
euros.  The appreciation of currencies in Eastern Europe relative
to the euro increased the value of Immofinanz’s assets in the
region, the company said. Income from property developments was
lifted by sales of Austrian apartments.  “The improved earnings was largely driven by foreign
currency effects,” said Christoph Thurnberger, an analyst at
Raiffeisen Centrobank with a “buy” rating on the stock. “Even
if you adjust for that, there are cost improvements and there
are more sales of Austrian apartments than we expected.”  Immofinanz rose 13.3 cents to 2.34 euros at the 5:30
p.m. close in Vienna, the highest rise since May 2010 and the
second-best performance among the 24 stocks in the  Stoxx 600
Real Estate Index . The shares have dropped 14.4 percent in the
past six months, reducing the company’s market value to 2.7
billion euros.  The developer reiterated its plan to raise the dividend for
fiscal 2012 to 15 cents a share from 10 cents a year earlier.  Immofinanz, which competes with companies including Atrium
European Real Estate Ltd. and CA Immobilien Anlagen AG, owns 9
billion euros of residential, retail, office and logistics
properties in Austria,  Germany  and eastern European countries
including  Poland , the  Czech Republic , Hungary and  Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
