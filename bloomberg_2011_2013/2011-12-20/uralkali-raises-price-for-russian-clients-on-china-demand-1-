OAO Uralkali (URKA) , the world’s largest
potash producer, will raise prices for Russian complex
fertilizer makers by 34 percent in the first quarter of 2012
after prices for China increased.  Uralkali will charge domestic complex fertilizer makers
9,318 rubles a metric ton, compared with 6,970 rubles now, the
Russian company’s press office said today in e-mailed statement.
Prices for industrial users, such as oil producers, will rise
about 23 percent to as much as 10,828 rubles a ton.  The domestic prices exclude transportation costs and taxes,
Uralkali said.  Global potash prices, which Uralkali uses to calculate the
amount it charges Russian fertilizer makers and industrial
consumers, surged in the third quarter. Uralkali used the
average weighted export price in its least-expensive market in
the previous quarter to setting domestic rates, the company said
by e-mail.  Belarusian Potash Co., Uralkali’s trading arm, charged
Chinese clients $400 a ton, including transportation costs, in
January through June. BPC, as it’s known, raised the price for
 China  to $470 a ton from July, still the least expensive of its
markets, according to the trader’s  website .  All domestic prices exclude transportation costs and taxes,
Uralkali said. Russian farmers will pay about 4,700 rubles a
ton, an 11 percent increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
