Gasoline and heating oil rose the
most in seven weeks, tracking gains in crude, after the U.S.
Commerce Department said builders broke ground on the most
houses in 19 months.  Gasoline futures jumped as much as 3.7 percent after the
report that November housing starts increased to a 685,000
annual rate, the highest level since April 2010. Building
permits also climbed to the most in more than a year.  “The markets really rallied when the housing starts came
out,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. “It boosted optimism that this sector is bottoming out
and moving upward.”  Gasoline for January delivery rose 7.39 cents, or 3
percent, to $2.563 a gallon as of 11:55 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the biggest gain since Oct. 27. The futures
are up 4.5 percent this year.  Prices advanced as oil futures rose 3.1 percent to $96.82 a
barrel on the exchange, boosted by the housing data and concern
that further sanctions against Iran could crimp supplies.  The European Union added 180 Iranian officials and
companies to a blacklist this month to intensify pressure on
Iran over its nuclear program, after the U.S. imposed stiffer
penalties in November.  “There are worries that the EU will impose more sanctions
on  Iran  which would further tighten up oil supplies,” Lipow
said.  Iran Production  Iran is the second-largest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, trailing  Saudi Arabia . The
country pumped about 5 percent of the world’s oil last year,
based on BP’s annual Statistical Review of World Energy.  U.S. stockpiles of gasoline probably rose 1.5 million
barrels last week, the median of 12 analyst estimates compiled
by  Bloomberg . Estimates ranged from a decline of 2 million
barrels to an increase of 3 million. The Energy Department
releases its weekly inventory report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  Inventories of heating oil and diesel dropped 750,000
barrels, according to the survey.  January-delivery heating oil gained 6.16 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $2.842 a gallon, extending the gain this year to 12
percent.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.8
cent to $3.213 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.
Prices, which are the lowest since Feb. 22, are 7.8 percent
higher than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
