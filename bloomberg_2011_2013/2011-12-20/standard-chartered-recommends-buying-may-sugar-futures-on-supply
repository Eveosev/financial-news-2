Investors should buy raw sugar
futures for May delivery traded in New York as prices may rise
on “supply slippages” and production costs in Brazil, the
biggest producer, according to  Standard Chartered  Plc.  The cost of production in Brazil is about 22 cents a pound,
close to the market price, the bank said in a report e-mailed
today. Prices have dropped 28 percent this year, likely
discouraging cane planting in Brazil and India, the second-
largest grower and biggest consumer, Standard Chartered said.  The May futures contract may climb to 28 cents a pound, and
investors should sell if it falls to 18 cents a pound,  Abah Ofon , an analyst at the bank, wrote in the report.  More plantings will be needed to encourage output and to
boost “still-anemic” inventories, according to the bank. The
May futures contract rose 0.4 percent to 22.84 cents a pound by
8:04 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
