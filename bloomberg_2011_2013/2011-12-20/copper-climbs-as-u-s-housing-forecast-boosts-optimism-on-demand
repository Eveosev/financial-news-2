Copper rose in  New York  after a
report showed U.S. housing starts rose last month, boosting the
outlook for metals demand.  Builders in the U.S., the world’s second-biggest copper
buyer, began work on the most homes in more than a year, a sign
the market may be stabilizing heading into 2012. The metal also
advanced as European leaders pledged 150 billion euros ($195
billion) to the  International Monetary Fund  to fight the
region’s debt crisis. The euro rose as much as 1 percent against
the  dollar .  “The U.S. is showing slow but consistent improvement,”
 Matthew Zeman , a strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “Trading is also going to be
dictated by what the dollar is doing in this low-volume week
ahead of the holidays.”  Copper futures for March delivery gained 1.8 percent to
settle at $3.3695 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The metal has dropped 24 percent this year as  Europe ’s debt
crisis escalated and demand weakened in  China , the world’s
largest user.  “There’s some worry about China slowing down,” Zeman
said. “People will continue to watch Europe and China.”  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 2.1 percent to $7,410 a metric ton ($3.36 a pound).  Aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and tin also climbed in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
