The Czech Republic’s equity index
rose the most in three weeks, led by  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and  Erste Group Bank
AG (EBS) , after reports on U.S. housing starts and German business
confidence boosted investor demand for riskier assets worldwide.  The  PX (PX)  gauge of 14 companies jumped as much as 1.9 percent,
the most since Nov. 30, and traded up 1.8 percent to 868.2 as of
3:58 p.m. in Prague. CEZ, the biggest Czech power utility, and
Austria’s Erste gained more than 3.3 percent. The two stocks
have a combined 38 percent weighting in the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
