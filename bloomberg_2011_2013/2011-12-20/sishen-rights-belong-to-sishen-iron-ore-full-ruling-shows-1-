The  High Court  of  South Africa ’s
North Gauteng Division issued its full judgment on the disputed
issue of a stake in a mining deposit at the country’s Sishen
complex, the country’s largest iron-ore mine.  Sishen Iron Ore Co., owned by Anglo American Plc unit Kumba
Iron Ore and Exxaro Resources Ltd., holds the rights over the
Sishen deposit, and any decision to award a stake to parties
including Imperial Crown Trading 289 (Pty) Ltd. is void, the
court said in a judgment sent today by e-mail.  The court released an outline ruling last week. It
overturned the award of prospecting rights for the Sishen
mine to Imperial Crown Trading, whose owners include Jagdish Parekh, a business partner of President  Jacob Zuma ’s son,
Duduzane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
