Qatar Petroleum  will pay an interest
rate of 2.19 percentage points over Libor for $3.34 billion in
bank loans to help finance the Barzan natural-gas project,
Finance Director Abdul Rahman Al Sheebi said.  Qatar Petroleum, the Gulf country’s state-run energy
company, said on Dec. 13 it had completed financing arrangements
for Barzan with a $7.2 billion syndicated loan. The project will
be funded with as much as 30 percent equity, while banks
together with export credit agencies from  Japan , Korea and  Italy 
will provide debt, the company said at the time in an e-mailed
statement.  Interest on the bank-loan component will be charged at the
spread over Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, Al
Sheebi said today in Mesaieed, Qatar.  Qatar Petroleum and  Exxon Mobil Corp.  signed an agreement
in January to develop the Barzan gas facility. At an estimated
cost of $10.3 billion, it will be the country’s most-expensive
energy project since  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  announced the Pearl
gas-to-liquids plant, now budgeted at about $19 billion, in
2006. Qatar is the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural
gas.  Barzan’s two plants are to produce 1.4 billion cubic feet
of gas a day for domestic needs once completed in 2015. Qatar
Petroleum will own 93 percent of the project and Exxon the
remainder, while Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Co., one of
Qatar’s two gas liquefaction companies, will develop it.  To contact the reporters on this story:
