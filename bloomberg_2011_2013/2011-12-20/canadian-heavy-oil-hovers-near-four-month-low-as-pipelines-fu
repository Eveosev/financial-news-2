remained near the weakest in four months as demand for shipping
space on pipelines that transport  Alberta  crude to and within
the U.S. exceeded capacity.  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP)  said today demand to move

capacity by 63 percent. The 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) system

its Line 5 by 22 percent. Line 5 runs from Superior, Wisconsin,
to Sarnia, Ontario, and can carry 491,200 barrels a day,
