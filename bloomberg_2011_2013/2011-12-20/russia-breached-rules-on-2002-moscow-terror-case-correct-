(Corrects amount in second paragraph.)  Russia violated European human
rights rules guaranteeing the right to life and the absence of
torture in its handling of the liberation of hostages during a
2002 terrorist attack on a Moscow theater, a court ruled.  The European Human Rights Court said Russia must pay 64
victims damages of at least 8,800 euros each in relation to the
rescue operation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
