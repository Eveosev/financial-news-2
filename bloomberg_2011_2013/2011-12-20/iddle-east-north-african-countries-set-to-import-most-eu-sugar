Countries in the  Middle East  and
North Africa regions are set to import most of the sugar
exported by the European Union in the season started in October,
according to Swiss Sugar Brokers.  Syria, Tunisia, Libya and Iraq are among the nations set to
“absorb” most of the 1.4 million metric tons of sugar that the
27-nation bloc still has to export,  Naim Beydoun , a broker at
the Rolle, Switzerland-based company said in an e-mail response
to questions yesterday.  White, or refined sugar from the EU for loading in January
at the ports of Le Havre, Antwerp and Dunkerque was at a premium
of $45 a ton to the price of the March contract on the NYSE
Liffe exchange in  London , data from the broker show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
