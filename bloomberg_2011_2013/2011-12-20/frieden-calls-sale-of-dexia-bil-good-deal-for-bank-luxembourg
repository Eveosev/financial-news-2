Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said the sale of  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s unit in the country is a
“good deal” for the bank and for Luxembourg.  Dexia, the French-Belgian lender being broken up after
running out of short-term funding, signed an agreement to sell
its Dexia Banque Internationale à Luxembourg SA unit for a total
of 730 million euros ($950 million). Precision Capital of Qatar
will buy 90 percent of the unit, with the Luxembourg government
acquiring the rest, the bank said today.  “We have a financially strong investor and that was
important,” Frieden said today in a telephone interview with
Bloomberg News. “It was important to take out BIL from this
group that had a number of structural problems.”  Frieden said Luxembourg agreed to pay 73 million euros for
its 10 percent stake.  “We have this way reached our goal as the Luxembourg
government to strengthen BIL as a systemic bank for
Luxembourg,” Frieden said. “It’s a good deal for Dexia; it’s a
good deal for BIL, and it’s especially a good deal for
Luxembourg.”  Frieden said he expects regulatory approval by the European
Union and Luxembourg in the next few weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
