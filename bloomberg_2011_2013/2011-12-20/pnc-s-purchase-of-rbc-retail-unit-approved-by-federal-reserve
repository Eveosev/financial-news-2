PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the sixth-largest U.S. bank by deposits, won approval from the
Federal Reserve to purchase  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) ’s U.S. retail-
banking unit.  Central bank officials approved the transaction today,
according to a statement on the agency’s website. The Fed didn’t
disclose reasons for its decision.  PNC, based in Pittsburgh, agreed in June to pay $3.62
billion in cash and stock for Raleigh, North Carolina-based RBC
Bank USA to add more than 420 branches and related credit-card
assets. The deal may close in March 2012, PNC has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
