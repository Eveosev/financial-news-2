More migrants left  New Zealand  than
arrived for the eighth month in the past nine, extending the
biggest exodus in a decade, after residents were uprooted by an
earthquake in the South Island city of Christchurch.  Permanent departures exceeded arrivals by 50 in November,
 Statistics New Zealand  said in Wellington today. In the year to
Nov. 30, there were 568 net departures, up from 103 in the 12
months through October.  Christchurch was devastated by a Feb. 22 temblor that
killed 181 people, wrecked homes and closed many businesses in
the nation’s second-largest city. Christchurch residents
departing permanently overseas rose to 6,500 from March through
November from 4,200 in the same period last year, the statistics
agency said.  Falling migration adds to signs that New Zealand’s economy
isn’t able to match the job opportunities and wages of nations
including  Australia . The number of New Zealanders leaving for
Australia rose 44 percent to 44,937 in the year ended Nov. 30
from 31,252 in the year through November 2010.  Short-term visitor arrivals slumped 12 percent from
October, when they were boosted by fans attending the Rugby
 World Cup , the report showed. Arrivals rose 1.7 percent from
November 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
