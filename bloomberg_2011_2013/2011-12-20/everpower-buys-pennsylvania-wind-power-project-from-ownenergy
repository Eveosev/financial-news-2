EverPower Wind Holdings Inc., a
closely held U.S. energy developer for rural communities, bought
a 30-megawatt project in  Pennsylvania  from OwnEnergy Inc. and
expects to complete construction by the end of 2012.  The Patton wind farm will be built on agricultural land in
the townships of Elder, West Carroll, and East Carroll,
OwnEnergy said today in an e-mailed statement. Financial details
weren’t disclosed.   The project is partially funded by a $3.2 million grant
from Pennsylvania’s Commonwealth Financing Authority, the
Brooklyn, New York-based company said. EverPower is owned by its
employees and Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., a private
equity company headed by financier  Guy Hands .  To contact the reporter on this story:
