The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slipped 0.9
percent to 1,370.19 by 1:46 p.m. in Moscow. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index lost 1 percent to 1,356.09.  The following are among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis:  OAO Aeroflot  (AFLT RX),  Russia ’s largest airline, snapped a
ten-day losing streak and rose after reporting a 37 percent
increase in nine-month profit to $384 million compared with a
year earlier. The stock jumped as much as 3.3 percent before
paring its gains to 0.5 percent at 45 rubles.  OAO Sberbank  (SBER03 RX), the nation’s largest bank, headed
for its lowest close in more than a week, down 1.7 percent to
80.23 rubles, after the ruble fell for a third day against the
dollar. A weaker domestic currency encourages Russians to
withdraw and convert ruble deposits, Sberbank’s main source of
funding.  VTB Group  (VTBR RX), the second-largest bank, lost 0.6
percent to 6.165 kopeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
