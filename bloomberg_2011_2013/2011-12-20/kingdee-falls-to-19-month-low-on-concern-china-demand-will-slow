Kingdee International Software Group
Co. (268) , a Chinese business solutions software provider, plunged to
a 19-month low in Hong Kong trading on concern that it may lose
orders from small-and medium-sized companies because of a global
economic slowdown.  Kingdee dropped 10 percent to HK$1.86, the lowest level
since May 26, 2010, on the city’s stock exchange. The stock has
fallen 49 percent this year, compared with a 22 percent decline
in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Profit growth may slow for the Shenzhen-based company as
demand for its software eases from  China ’s smaller businesses
hurt by weaker sales to overseas customers, according to Johnie Hu, an analyst at BOC International Group. China’s exports grew
13.8 percent in November, the weakest pace since 2009, excluding
aberrations caused by the lunar new year holidays.  “Kingdee is affected by the poor macroeconomic
environment,” Hu said in a phone interview today. The company’s
earnings outlook has will face “low visibility” in the first
half of 2012, she said.  Hu cut the stock’s rating to “hold” from “buy” on Dec.
16.  Kingdee’s profit for the six months ended June 30 rose 43
percent to 127 million yuan ($20 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
