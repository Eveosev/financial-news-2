Reserve Bank  of India Deputy
Governor Subir Gokarn comments on the rupee, shortage of money
in the banking system and monetary policy. He was speaking to
reporters in Mumbai today.  On rupee:  “Although it’s at 53, it has been relatively more stable,
If you go by the intra-day volatility that was some weeks ago.
That may reflect the fact that some of the measures that we have
taken are helping to keep some boundaries on it.  ‘‘These measures are not the only measures we have, there
are other measures we can undertake to bring stability to this
market and as the need arises we will use them.  ‘‘But for the moment, in the aftermath of the several
measures we have taken in two or three different rounds, clearly
some degree of stability has returned and that’s important.’’  On money shortage:  ‘‘The immediate pressure on liquidity is from advance tax
collections, which are roughly about 690 billion rupees ($13
billion) last week. Obviously, that is going to be spent over a
period of time. So, the current pressure is clearly short term.  ‘‘But the quantity is reflective of the mismatch, we don’t
expect this to remain. I think, things will normalize over the
next few days.’’  On cutting  interest rates :  ‘‘‘We haven’t given any timeframe. We have been saying that
under the current circumstances the next action will not be a
hike. But we are not saying when that next action will be. We
can’t make that commitment at this point.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
