Japan  plans to bolster its
intervention war chest to an unprecedented amount, a sign of the
government’s vigilance against a yen near postwar highs against
the  U.S. dollar .  The Finance Ministry plans to raise the issuance limit for
bills to fund currency intervention to 195 trillion yen ($2.5
trillion), the first increase since Sept. 30, according to
government documents released in Tokyo today. More than 65
trillion yen will be available for additional intervention,
according to the ministry.  The measure comes after Japan sold a record amount of its
currency in the month from Oct. 28 as the appreciating yen
weakens the world’s third-largest economy’s rebound from the
March 11 temblor. Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said today the
increase was needed because he wants to be prepared to take
“decisive” actions when needed.  The yen traded at 78.01 per dollar at 12:31 p.m. and rose
to a postwar record of 75.35 yen on Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
