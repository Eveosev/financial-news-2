Russia agreed with six ex-Soviet
nations to secure a veto on outside powers establishing military
bases in the region, RIA Novosti reported, citing President
 Dmitry Medvedev â€™s spokeswoman.  Russia considers the agreement with Armenia, Belarus,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as a positive
step for regional stability, Natalya Timakova said today,
according to the state news service.  Newly elected Kyrgyz Presidentv Almazbek Atambayev plans to
close a U.S. base when the lease runs out in 2014, the New York
Times reported. Manas base, near to the capital Bishkek, is a
supply hub for NATO forces in  Afghanistan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
