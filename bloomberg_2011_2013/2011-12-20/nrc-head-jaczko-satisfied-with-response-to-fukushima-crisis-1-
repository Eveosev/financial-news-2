U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
Chairman  Gregory Jaczko  said he’s satisfied with  Tokyo Electric
Power Co. (9501) ’s efforts to end the crisis at the wrecked Fukushima
atomic plant.  The melted fuel in the reactors at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant has cooled enough to prevent any further releases
of radiation beyond the station, Jaczko told reporters today in
Tokyo after a visit to the station.  He spoke four days after Japanese officials declared that
the reactors, which were damaged by the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami, have been brought to a state known as cold shutdown.
Some nuclear scientists disputed that the term accurately
described conditions at the plant. Jaczko called the declaration
a “tremendous milestone.”  “I feel very comfortable that they have completed really
the requirements that are necessary to move on to the next
stage,” he said. “There’s really no energy left in the reactor
to have an off-site release of radiation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
