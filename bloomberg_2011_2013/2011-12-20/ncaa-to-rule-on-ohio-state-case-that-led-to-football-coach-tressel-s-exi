The  National Collegiate Athletic
Association  is set to announce its decision on violations at
 Ohio State University  that cost football coach Jim Tressel his
job and the school a season’s worth of victories.  The NCAA will make a statement at 3 p.m.  New York  time.  Ohio  State, based in Columbus, Ohio, vacated all 12 of its
victories from the 2010 season, including a win in the Sugar
Bowl, because of the violations that led to the departure of
Tressel in May. The school announced its self-imposed action on
the 2010 season in July.  Tressel, 59, quit almost six months after players including
quarterback Terrelle Pryor were suspended for selling or trading
uniforms and other memorabilia to the owner of a tattoo parlor.
His resignation followed revelations that the coach knew about
the infractions and didn’t report them.  Five players involved in the violations received five-game
suspensions from the school, which also imposed a two-year
probation and said it plans to enhance its monitoring, education
and compliance programs.  Tressel led the Buckeyes to the national championship after
the 2002 season. He originally was suspended by the school in
March for two games the following season, then increased that
ban himself to five games before saying he was leaving as coach.  After interim coach Luke Fickell led the Buckeyes to a 6-6
record this season, the school hired two-time national
championship winner Urban Meyer as coach on Nov. 28. The
Buckeyes face the University of  Florida  in the Gator Bowl on
Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
