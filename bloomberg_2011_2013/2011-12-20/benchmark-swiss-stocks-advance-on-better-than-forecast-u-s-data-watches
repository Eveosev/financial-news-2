  Swiss stocks (SMI)  climbed for a second
day following a report that showed better-than-estimated housing
starts in the world’s largest economy and as watchmakers
advanced.  Swatch Group AG (UHR)  and Cie. Financiere Richemont SA rose at
least 2.9 percent after Swiss watch exports increased. Novartis
AG,  Europe’s biggest drugmaker by sales (NOVN) , slid 0.4 percent after
deciding to stop a clinical test of its heart drug Tekturna.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of  Switzerland ’s biggest
and most actively traded companies, gained 0.6 percent to
5,804.31 at the close in Zurich. The benchmark has declined 10
percent this year as the euro area sovereign-debt crisis spread.
The broader Swiss Performance Index rose 0.8 percent today.  “The combination of bargain hunters and a quiet market
could well offer a degree of support in the days ahead,” said
Terry Pratt, an institutional trader at IG Markets.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said that
substantial risks to the economy remain. The 17-member euro area
and four European Union countries that don’t use the single
currency agreed to channel 150 billion euros ($195 billion) to
the  International Monetary Fund  following a meeting of finance
ministers yesterday.  Swiss Exports  Swiss exports  declined the most in three months in
November. Foreign sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal
swings, fell 6.8 percent from October, the Federal Customs
Office in Bern said today.  Imports  dropped 7.7 percent after
rising 1.4 percent in the previous month and the country’s  trade
surplus  widened to 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) from
2.16 billion francs in October.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report today showed that
builders began work on the most houses in over a year in
November.  Starts  increased 9.3 percent to a 685,000 annual rate,
topping the  highest estimate of economists  surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  Building permits , a proxy for future construction, also
climbed to a more than one-year high.  Swatch, the world’s largest watchmaker, gained 2.9 percent
to 338 francs as a report showed that Swiss watch exports rose
16 percent in November from a year earlier. Richemont, the owner
of the Cartier brand, increased 3 percent to 46.33 francs.  Clariant AG rallied 5.2 percent to 9.21 francs and Syngenta
AG rose 2.5 percent to 267.10 francs as a gauge of chemical
companies was the second-best performer in the Stoxx 600,
gaining 3.4 percent.  Implenia, Roche  Implenia AG (IMPN) , Switzerland’s biggest builder, gained 2.3
percent to 22.50 francs, its highest price this month, after the
company said 2011 profit will exceed 2010 net income because of
improved business in tunneling and real-estate project
development.  Serge Rotzer, an analyst at Vontobel Holding AG, upgraded
the stock to “buy” from “hold.”  Novartis lost 0.4 percent to 52.60 francs after saying it
decided to stop a clinical test of the heart drug Tekturna in a
group of high-risk patients for safety reasons, a setback that
may hurt sales of the medicine.  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the world’s largest maker of cancer
drugs, fell 0.4 percent to 157.70 francs and  Sonova Holding AG (SOON) ,
the hearing-aid maker, dropped 0.8 percent to 90.20 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
