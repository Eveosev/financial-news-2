The Egyptian pound gained after
 Orascom Construction Industries  said it will sell dollars to
repay bonds in local currency.  The pound strengthened 0.1 percent, the most since Dec. 14,
to 6.0200 a dollar at 1:23 p.m. in Cairo. It has declined 3.6
percent this year after a 44 percent slump in the country’s
foreign currency reserves.  Orascom,  Egypt ’s biggest publicly traded builder, said
yesterday it will sell about $300 million to help repay a 1.65
billion-pound bond as part of a “debt refinancing package” for
the company’s fertilizer units. The company said last month it
will repay its 11.75 percent bonds by Dec. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
