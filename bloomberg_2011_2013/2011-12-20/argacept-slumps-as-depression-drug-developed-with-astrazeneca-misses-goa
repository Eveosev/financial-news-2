Targacept Inc., (TRGT)  developer of an
experimental depression treatment with  AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) , plunged
36 percent after the drug failed to meet the main goal of a
second trial.  Targacept fell $2.79 to $4.99 at the close of New York
trading. The shares of the Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based
company have dropped 81 percent this year.  The drug, TC-5214, failed in the second of four late-stage
efficacy trials in patients with major depressive disorder for
whom antidepressants alone didn’t work, London-based AstraZeneca
said in a statement today. AstraZeneca had licensed the
depression treatment from Targacept Inc. in 2009 in a deal
valued at as much as $1.24 billion.  “We believe the probability of success is too low to still
see a compelling risk/reward,” said  Joshua Schimmer , a New
York-based analyst for Leerink Swann, in a note to investors
today.  AstraZeneca and Targacept said last month the compound
failed to meet the main goal of its first trial, prompting
Targacept shares to fall 60 percent on Nov. 8. The drug was
meant to normalize certain brain receptors thought to be
overstimulated in depression.  To contact the reporter on this story:
