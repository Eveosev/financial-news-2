Payrolls increased in 29 states in
November, while the jobless rate declined in 43, a sign the
labor market is recovering across much of the U.S.  New York  led the nation with a 29,500 gain in jobs,
followed by Texas with 20,800, figures from the Labor Department
showed today in Washington. The biggest drop in unemployment was
in Michigan, where the jobless rate fell 0.8 percentage point to
9.8 percent.  “We’re seeing a modest recovery in hiring across much of
the country,”  Mark Vitner , a senior economist at Wells Fargo
Securities LLC in Charlotte,  North Carolina , said before the
report. “There are a few hot spots where activity is
stronger.”  The improvement comes as lawmakers in Congress remained
deadlocked over extending a payroll tax cut and long-term
unemployment benefits by an end-of-year deadline. U.S. employers
added 120,000 workers in November and the unemployment rate
unexpectedly fell to 8.6 percent, the lowest since March 2009,
the Labor Department reported Dec. 2.  The unemployment rates in  Alabama , Minnesota,  South
Carolina  and Utah dropped by 0.6 a percentage point each in
November, marking the second-biggest declines statistically.  Nevada’s jobless rate dropped to 13 percent from 13.4
percent in October, still leaving it as the highest in the U.S.
California followed at 11.3 percent. North Dakota had the lowest
unemployment at 3.4 percent.  Economic Growth  The economy expanded at a 2 percent pace in the third
quarter, revised government data showed last month. That
following an average 0.9 percent rate of growth in the first
half of the year.  The biggest payroll losses last month were in Wisconsin,
where employment dropped by 14,600, and Minnesota, which showed
a loss of 13,700 jobs.  The jobless rate in  Michigan  has dropped 1.6 percentage
points over the past 12 months, which may in part reflect a
rebound in auto making.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  has agreed to create 12,000 jobs, invest
$6.2 billion in factory upgrades and give each of its 40,600
U.S. workers as much as $10,000 in bonus and profit-sharing
payments this year.  State and local employment data are derived independently
from the national statistics, which are typically released on
the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject
to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller
surveys, making the national figures more reliable, according to
the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.  To contact the reporters on this story:
