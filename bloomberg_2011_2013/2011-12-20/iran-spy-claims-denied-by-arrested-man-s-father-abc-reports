The father of an Iranian-American
man detained by  Iran  and accused of spying for the Central
Intelligence Agency said the allegations are untrue and his son
was forced by the Iranian government to lie, ABC reported.  Ali Hekmati said that, while Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, his 28-
year-old son, did join the U.S. military in 2001, he served in
the Marines, not the Army, and worked in linguistics as an
Arabic translator, not in military intelligence, ABC reported on
its  website  yesterday.  He has never done intelligence work for the Pentagon or the
CIA, his father, a biology professor at Mott Community College
in Flint,  Michigan , told ABC.  Hekmati, the son, received military and intelligence
training in the U.S. Army, Iranian state media reported
yesterday. Iran, which broadcast images of Hekmati two days ago,
said he was arrested after entering the country on a mission to
infiltrate Iran’s intelligence ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
