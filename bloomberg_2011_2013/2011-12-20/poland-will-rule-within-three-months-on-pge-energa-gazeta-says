Poland’s Treasury Ministry will
decide within three months whether to allow  PGE SA (PGE) , the
country’s No. 1 power utility, to abandon a plan to acquire
state-owned Energa SA, Gazeta Wyborcza reported, citing no one.
The likely outcome is that PGE will be cleared to drop the
transaction, which was blocked by the antitrust regulator last
year, and Energa will be listed on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange ,
Gazeta reported, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
