Crude oil inventories fell 4.57
million barrels to 330 million last week, the  American Petroleum
Institute  said.  Distillate fuel inventories  fell 2.78 million barrels to
139.6 million, the APIâ€™s weekly report showed.  Gasoline
stockpiles  declined 394,000 barrels to 213.9 million.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropped 1.01
million barrels to 30.2 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil fell
2.13 million barrels last week, according to the median of 12
responses in a  Bloomberg News  survey. Gasoline inventories
probably advanced 1.5 million barrels and distillate inventories
probably fell 750,000 barrels, the survey showed.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for February delivery rose $3.41, or 3.6 percent,
to $97.46 a barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New
