Hang Ten Group Holdings Ltd. (448)  surged
by a record in  Hong Kong  trading after a HK$2.65 billion ($340
million) buyout offer from Li & Fung Retailing Ltd. that values
the shares at 59 percent more than their previous close.  The clothier jumped as much as 56 percent, headed for the 
biggest gain since listing in 2003, before trading 55 percent 
higher at HK$2.64 as of 9:54 a.m. local time.  Li & Fung Retailing, whose parent also controls  Li & Fung
Ltd. (494) , offered to buy all outstanding shares, Hong Kong-based
Hang Ten said in a filing yesterday. Apparel companies were the
targets in 105 acquisitions, valued at a total of $2.6 billion,
in  China  and Hong Kong during the past three years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Li & Fung Retailing offered HK$2.70 cash for each Hang Ten
share, 59 percent higher than the last-traded price of HK$1.70
on Dec. 15, according to the filing.  YGM Trading Ltd. (375)  pledged to accept the offer for the 214.2
million Hang Ten shares it owns and a further 8.2 million it has
on deposit with a law firm, according to a separate Hong Kong
stock exchange statement yesterday. The family of Dennis Kung
agreed to sell its 464.2 million shares, YGM said. YGM and
Kungâ€™s family together control a 69.9 percent stake in Hang Ten,
according to the filing.  Citigroup Inc. advised Li & Fung on the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
