Air Seychelles  plans to cut its
long-haul fleet to one Boeing 767 as it seeks to return to
profit by stopping European flights and focusing on regional
routes, Finance Minister Danny Faure said.  Negotiations have started with American International Group
Inc.’s plane-leasing unit to return two planes, Faure said in an
interview today in  Mauritius . “We returned two aircraft in
November,” he said.  The state-owned airline is being restructured after the
government announced it will no longer provide funds for day-to-
day operational expenses. Since January, the state has disbursed
206 million rupees ($15 million), and such subsidies are
“unsustainable” in the long run, Faure said.  The new business model implies a shift from “loss-making”
long-haul trips to a regional approach, with intra-island
services and flights to Mauritius and  South Africa , Faure said.
“There are risks” associated with the plan, he said. “Our
priority is to cut losses.”  There will be job cuts among the airline’s 900 employees,
with 156 million rupees earmarked in the 2012 budget for the
company’s expenses and redundancy costs through March, Faure
said.  Seychelles, an Indian Ocean archipelago, expects its
economy to expand 4 percent in 2012 compared with 5 percent this
year. Tourism accounts for 25 percent of gross domestic product,
Faure said, with about 75 percent of visitors coming from
 Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
