Taiwan ’s dollar gained the most in
almost two weeks on speculation exporters took advantage of a
relatively favorable exchange rate to repatriate income.
Government bonds fell for a third day.  Companies converted overseas earnings after the local
dollar touched this month’s lowest level earlier amid concern
Europe’s debt crisis will hurt developing economies, according
to Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. Asian  stock indexes (MXAP)  rose
today after Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker predicted the U.S. economy will grow at least 2 percent
in 2012, brightening the outlook for the region’s exports.  “The Taiwan dollar rebounded a bit on some selling of the
greenback by exporters,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based
foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial. “It
should continue its weaker trend. Demand for the  U.S. dollar  is
high when the economic outlook isn’t good.”  The Taiwan dollar gained 0.2 percent to NT$30.353 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$30.410 earlier, the weakest level since Nov. 30. Lin predicts
the currency will decline to NT$30.500 by Dec. 31.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent bonds due September
2021, the most-traded government securities, increased two basis
points to 1.269 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market
show.  Benchmark  10-year rates have dropped 28 basis points, or
0.28 percentage point, in 2011.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was unchanged at 0.399 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
