Germany  expects to contribute 8.6
billion euros ($11.2 billion) to  Europe ’s permanent rescue fund
next year, double the originally planned amount,  Die Welt  said,
citing a government official it didn’t identify.  The expected higher payment results from decisions by
European Union leaders in Brussels on Dec. 9 relating to the
fund, the European Stability Mechanism, which governments aim to
start up one year early in mid-2012, the Berlin-based newspaper
reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
