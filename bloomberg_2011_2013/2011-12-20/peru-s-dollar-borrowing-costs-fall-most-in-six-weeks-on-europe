Peru ’s benchmark  borrowing costs  in
dollars fell the most in six weeks after an unexpected rise in
German business confidence boosted demand for higher yielding,
emerging market assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 215 at 3:56 p.m. New York time, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. It was the biggest drop since Nov. 3.  The Munich-based Ifo institute’s business climate index
rose to 107.2 from 106.6 in November, after economists surveyed
by Bloomberg had forecast a drop to 106. Peru’s dollar borrowing
costs rose to a two-year high of 295 basis points above
Treasuries on Oct. 3 on concern the euro area’s debt crisis will
push European economies into recession.  “Data out of  Germany  shows that investor and consumer
confidence is withstanding the effects of the as-yet unresolved
debt crisis,” said  Roberto Flores , head of research at Inteligo
SAB, a Lima-based brokerage.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 was little changed at 5.74 percent,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.6945 per  U.S. dollar .  The Andean country’s central bank bought $151 million in
the  spot market  today to slow gains in the local currency. The
bank paid an average 2.6940 soles per dollar, it said on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
