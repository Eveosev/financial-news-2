(Corrects number of years in headline, first paragraph.)  Finland ’s  jobless rate  dropped to
the lowest in three years last month, boosted by domestic
demand.  The  unemployment rate , which isn’t adjusted for seasonal
variations, fell to 6.2 percent in November from 7 percent in
October, Helsinki-based  Statistics Finland  said today. The rate
was 6.1 percent in December 2008.  “The economy grew at a good pace in the autumn,” Reijo Heiskanen, chief economist at OP-Pohjola Group in Helsinki, said
by phone today. “The service industry and the domestic markets
have continued to function well.”  The better-than-estimated rate last month means the year’s
average unemployment rate may be better than OP-Pohjola’s
forecast of 7.9 percent, provided that employment “doesn’t
collapse” this month, Heiskanen said.  Even so, Finland’s economy is slowing as  Europe ’s sovereign
debt crisis deepens. Exports make up 40 percent of its economy
and a third of Finnish sales abroad go to the 17-nation single
currency area.  “We’re seeing signs of weakening growth in industry and
exports,” Heiskanen said. “For that to show in employment
numbers will take some time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
