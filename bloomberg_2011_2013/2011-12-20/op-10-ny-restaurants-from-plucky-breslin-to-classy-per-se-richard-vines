There were  23,499 restaurants  in New
York when the city checked last year. I visited about 30 on a
recent 10-day visit.  The best were superb. Others -- Dawat and Post House spring
to mind -- were disappointing. I had great coffee at Stumptown,
cocktails at the  Mandarin  Oriental Lobby Lounge, views at  Ink48 
hotel’s Press Lounge and cognac at the Brandy Library.  Most chefs knew I was coming, so these are not full-fledged
reviews. Here are my Top 10 restaurants of the trip:  Le Bernardin: Chef Eric Ripert prepared a tasting menu of
such outstanding quality that I’d travel to New York to repeat
the experience. Each dish -- from a starter of yellowfin tuna
with spiced dashi gelee and green peppercorn-Iberico chutney to
a dessert of milk-chocolate pot de creme, caramel foam, maple
syrup, Maldon sea syrup -- was inspired in its conception and
faultless in execution. I met Ripert afterwards: He speaks with
quiet confidence and is thoughtful and engaging. The hushed
restaurant reflects his style of understated originality.  155 W 51st Street, Midtown, NY 10019. Information:
+1-212-554-1515 or  http://www.le-bernardin.com/ .  The Breslin: This bar and dining room is as noisy as Le
Bernardin is hushed and doesn’t sit easily in a list of fancy
restaurants. Yet British chef April Bloomfield stands out in the
 New York  culinary world because of her full-on flavors. She can
stop you in mid-conversation with punchy herbed Caesar salad
with anchovy croutons. Char-grilled lamb burger with feta, cumin
mayo and thrice-cooked chips is probably her best-known dish.  20 W 29th Street, Ace Hotel, NY 10001. Information:
+1-212-679-1939 or  http://thebreslin.com/ .  Brushstroke: Chef  David Bouley , best known for his Tribeca
restaurant Bouley, opened this Japanese establishment to spread
his love of the kaiseki cuisine of Kyoto. If you’ve never tried
kaiseki, a meal consists of multiple courses, each with
different ingredients, engineered to create a harmony of tastes,
textures and temperatures. This is serious cooking -- in
association with the Tsuji  Cooking Academy  of  Osaka  -- and
Brushstroke isn’t a sushi restaurant.  30 Hudson Street, Tribeca, NY 10013. Information:
+1-212-791-3771 or  http://www.davidbouley.com/ .  Chef’s Table at  Brooklyn  Fare: This restaurant is housed
next door to a local supermarket in Brooklyn. There are no
tablecloths, you bring your own wine and it’s only open for
dinner. Yet Chef’s Table was awarded three Michelin stars this
year and diners from across the world travel to eat here. Chef
Cesar Ramirez prepares multiple small dishes of Japanese-French
cuisine, most centered on seafood and with minimal ingredients.  200 Schermerhorn Street, NY 11201. Information:
+1-718-243-0050 or  http://bit.ly/eh1abx .  Corton: This Tribeca restaurant belongs to Drew Nieporent
(co-owner of Nobu) and to  Paul Liebrandt , who is on the hunt for
a third Michelin star. Liebrandt trained in the U.K. with Marco Pierre White and Raymond Blanc before moving to Paris and  Pierre Gagnaire . His seasonal cooking reflects this experience: It’s
ambitious and challenging, with unusual flavor combinations such
as partridge with pumpkin, coffee and Meyer lemon. The service
is professional without being stuffy and there’s no music to
distract you.  239 W Broadway, Tribeca, NY 10013. Information:
+1-212-219-2777 or  http://www.cortonnyc.com/ .  Eleven Madison Park: Chef Daniel Humm and General Manager
Will Guidara completed their purchase of this restaurant (from
Danny Meyer) on the day I visited and it was the best meal of my
trip. The menu is unusual in that you just pick from a choice of
main ingredients and Humm creates dishes for you. He’s a superb
chef, his plates of food are unfussy with clean flavors and
clear focus. Service is first class. If you are lucky, you may
be invited into the kitchen for one course.  11 Madison Avenue, NY 10010. Information: +1-212-889-0905
or  http://www.elevenmadisonpark.com/ .  Gramercy Tavern: If you are looking for a contemporary
restaurant that exudes old-fashioned hospitality, you might do a
lot worse than eat at Gramercy Tavern. Owner Danny Meyer is an
inspiration for restaurateurs around the world. He respects
tradition, something he seeks to build on rather than hide
behind. From Shake Shack to the Modern, he delivers. At Gramercy
Tavern, Mike Anthony’s cooking is unpretentious: It’s about
adding value to classic dishes that already are deserving of
respect.  42 E 20th Street, NY 10003. Information: +1-212-477-0777 or
 http://www.gramercytavern.com/ .  Momofuku Ko: The entrance to Momofuku Ko is
unprepossessing. The window was barred and a dog was tethered
outside when I arrived. Chef  David Chang  was in Sydney. You step
inside and it’s not a lot fancier. There’s no menu. You just sit
at a counter and dishes arrive. His food isn’t just adventurous:
It tastes great.  163 First Avenue, NY 10003. Information: +1-212-777-7773 or
 http://www.momofuku.com/restaurants/ko/ .  Monkey Bar: I didn’t just get to eat in the Monkey Bar one
afternoon with chef Damon Wise, I got to meet owner Graydon Carter in his office at  Vanity Fair  to hear about it. I wonder
who wouldn’t enjoy dishes such as Peekytoe crab, mizuna,
grapefruit or sweet ricotta ravioli, field mushrooms, Parmesan.
Even though I was privileged to be eating with the chef, I’m
happy to find I’m not alone in loving the restaurant -- with its
Ed Sorel Jazz Age mural -- and Wise’s menu. The dining room is
my favorite in New York.  60 E 54th Street, Elysee Hotel, NY, 10022. Information:
+1-212-308-2950 or  http://www.elyseehotel.com/ .  Per Se: You may wait months for a table at Per Se and it
would be worth it. The food and service are faultless, the
tables so generously spaced that you might plot a bid for the
presidency without being overheard. Chef  Thomas Keller  is among
the world’s finest for dishes such as Oysters and Pearls: a
sabayon of pearl tapioca with oyster juice served with oysters
and caviar.  10 Columbus Circle, Time Warner Center, NY 10019.
