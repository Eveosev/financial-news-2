A U.S.- China  trade dispute over
solar equipment may expand to  India  where local manufacturers
are complaining about dumping and preferential financing from
Beijing and Washington that’s helping companies like  Suntech
Power Holdings Co. (STP)  and  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)   India may start an anti-dumping probe in a month into
imports of Chinese solar products, China’s Commerce Ministry
said yesterday in a statement. India’s Commerce Secretary  Rahul Khullar  declined to comment when reached on his mobile phone.  Local manufacturers are also seeking a 15 percent tariff on
imports of thin-film panels, Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary
Tarun Kapoor said in a phone interview yesterday. The biggest
maker of thin-film panels is Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar.  Indian suppliers like Tata BP Solar India Ltd.,  Indosolar
Ltd. (ISLR)  and  Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI)  have failed to benefit from a
rule intended to spawn a domestic manufacturing hub in one of
the world’s fastest-growing markets. Instead, low-cost Chinese
rivals like Suntech and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  and U.S. firms backed
by preferential trade finance including First Solar have reaped
most of the equipment orders for 1,100 megawatts of plants to be
built by January.  “It’s a disaster in the making,” said K. Subramanya,
chief executive officer of Tata BP Solar, 51 percent-owned by  BP
Plc  and India’s third-biggest cell and panel maker. “I’m
feeling a bit of anguish because we want solar to succeed but we
need fair competition.”  Default, Stalled Production  Local manufacturers have received almost no orders from
developers building plants in India and are producing far below
their factories’ full capacity, Subramanya said. India’s total
manufacturing capacity is about 1,500 megawatts of panels and
500 megawatts of cells, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  Indosolar, the nation’s biggest cell company, stopped
production in June and has defaulted on 2.75 billion rupees ($52
million) of long-term bank loans as its business became
“unviable,” Fitch Ratings analysts Vivek Jain and Salil Garg
said in a Dec. 5 note. They attributed the company’s problems to
a 62 percent plunge this year in the  selling price of cells  to
about 52 cents a watt amid intense Chinese competition and
declining demand in  Europe  where governments cut subsidies.  “We’re on the same wavelength as the U.S. manufacturers,”
Indosolar Managing Director H. Rahul Gupta said by phone
yesterday, referring to an Oct. 19 complaint lodged by Bonn-
based SolarWorld AG’s U.S. unit and six unidentified U.S.
companies.  The complaint alleged Beijing uses cash grants, raw-
materials discounts, preferential loans, tax incentives and
currency manipulation to boost exports of solar cells.  U.S. Suppliers Targeted  The Indian complaints extend to both U.S. and Chinese
exporters.  U.S. and Chinese suppliers have benefited from Indian
orders because of cheap credit provided by state-backed lenders,
said Anmol Singh Jaggi, director of Gensol Consultants Pvt.,
which advises project developers.  Indian projects that import U.S. equipment may be eligible
for loans from the Export-Import Bank of the U.S., which charges
about 3 percent to 4 percent interest. After hedging, the cost
of borrowing comes to about 9 percent compared with 13 percent
if they buy and borrow locally, he said.  In some cases, state-backed Chinese companies are offering
to supply equipment and get paid two years later, he said.  “No Indian company can match that,” Jaggi said. “Without
U.S. and Chinese credit, we wouldn’t have any solar projects
getting built.”  Thin-Film Exemption  U.S. and Chinese imports can be brought into the country
tax-free, whereas Indian manufacturers have to pay duties on raw
materials to make the same products. U.S. panel makers including
First Solar and Abound Solar Inc. have also benefited from an
exemption for thin-film products in the government’s Solar
Mission program that requires developers to use local equipment.  “Those are anomalies that must be addressed,” Gupta said.  Indian manufacturers have asked the renewable ministry to
waive duties on raw materials and supplies and to impose a 15
percent tariff on imports of thin-film panels, the ministry’s
Kapoor said by phone from  New Delhi .  The U.S. International Trade Commission on Dec. 2 took the
first step toward imposing added tariffs on Chinese solar
imports, voting unanimously on the petition that called for
antidumping and countervailing duties. The commission is now
holding a full investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
