Pavel Maslovskiy, a co-founder of
gold mining company  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , will resign as chief
executive officer and relinquish his board seat to become a
senator in  Russia ’s upper house of parliament.  Sergey Ermolenko, 58 and one of the five members of the
founding management team, will take over as CEO of the Russian
gold producer, Petropavlovsk said today in a statement.
Maslovskiy was nominated to serve as a Federation Council
senator after being elected on Dec. 4 to parliament in the Amur
Region, where the company’s mining operations are based.  “I will, of course, miss the day-to-day management of its
operations,” Maslovskiy said in the statement.  “It is my
intention to retain a substantial interest in the company
through the discretionary trusts of which I am a potential
beneficiary and which will continue to own Petropavlovsk
shares.”  Maslovskiy will also resign as a non-executive director of
 IRC Ltd. (1029) , a Hong-Kong traded iron-ore production unit of
Petropavlovsk.  Maslovskiy will be made honorary president at Petropavlovsk
and an emeritus director at IRC, with the right to advise the
board but no vote, Petropavlovsk and IRC said today in separate
statements.  Ermolenko, a Petropavlovsk shareholder, has been a senior
manager at the company since its inception in 1994, according to
the statement. Deputy CEO Martin Smith, 56, will aid Ermolenko,
who has limited English, in communicating with investors, the
company said. Ermolenko started working as an underground miner
and shift boss in the Amur region in 1974.  To contact the reporter on this story:
