Chinese equities traded in New York
rose the most in three weeks, led by solar energy stocks, after
the Asian nation pledged funding support for small companies and
as U.S. and German economic data that topped forecasts eased
concern the global economy may be headed to a recession.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index  of the most-traded Chinese
stocks gained 3 percent to 95.07 as trading closed in New York,
the biggest advance since Nov. 30.  Yingli Green Energy Holding
Co. (YGE) , the Baoding, China-based maker of solar modules, jumped 16
percent, the most since May 2009, and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  surged 10
percent.  Baidu Inc . leaped the most in two months after saying
its new cloud computing technology will be used in Dell Inc.’s
smartphones to be sold in  China .  China will provide capital support to small businesses, and
the government will stabilize policies on exports, including
rebate measures, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said Dec. 19 during a two-
day visit to Jiangsu province. He also asked the nation’s
export-oriented regions to expand domestic markets.  “Chinese state-owned banks are still lending to support
solar companies, even if the sector has been beaten down by
over-supply in China and weaker demand in Europe,” said Hari Chandra Polavarapu, a solar analyst at Auriga USA LLC in New
York. “The shares of some solar makers, particularly the low-
cost manufacturers, are getting a little respite now after being
under relentless pressure all through the year.”  Economic Indicators  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  rose 3 percent after a
Commerce Department report showed that U.S. housing starts
increased 9.3 percent to a 685,000 annual rate in November, more
than the 635,000 median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. In Germany, the Ifo institute’s business climate
index rose to 107.2 from 106.6, the Munich-based group said.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a drop to 106.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.1 percent to
2,215.93.  Yingli  Green rose to a two-week high of $4.11. Yingli gets
about 20 percent of its sales domestically, which gives it an
advantage when overseas demand slumps, according to Polavarapu.
Trina gained to $7.10 and  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  climbed 8.3
percent to $2.34.  The American depositary receipts of  JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) ,
the world’s largest solar cell maker, advanced 14 percent to
$1.40 after it announced a product that converts as much as 18.5
percent of the sun’s energy into electricity.  Canadian Solar  Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , which is based in Kitchener, Ontario,
and makes products in China, surged 33 percent to $2.95 in New
York after agreeing to sell nine  power plants  to TransCanada
Corp. for C$470 million ($456 million). The stock increased the
most among companies in the  Bloomberg Global Leaders Solar
Index (BLGS) , which leaped 4.4 percent.  The  ishares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., surged 4.3 percent, the most
this month, to $35.04. The Chinese yuan weakened 0.1 percent to
6.3472 a dollar, trimming its appreciation this month to 0.5
percent, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  Chinese oil producers advanced as crude gained for a second
day in New York.  PetroChina Co. (PTR) , the country’s largest energy
producer, soared 4.7 percent to $119.77.  Cnooc Ltd. (CEO) , advanced
3.3 percent to $177.96, while  China Petroleum and Chemical

 New York Mercantile Exchange .  Economic Growth  China, the world’s second-largest economy,  grew  9.1 percent
in the third quarter from a year earlier, down from 9.5 percent
in the second.  Consumer prices  rose 4.2 percent in November from
a year ago, the slowest pace in 14 months. The central bank will
likely cut the required reserve ratio for banks again in the

yesterday.  Baidu, owner of China’s most popular online search engine,
was removed from the U.S. government’s list of “notorious
markets” that help sustain piracy and counterfeiting of
intellectual property after reaching a content deal with the
recording industry this year. The  Internet company  said
yesterday its new cloud technology will be used in Dell’s Streak
D43 smartphone product for the China market.  Baidu’s ADRs surged 6.2 percent to $118.40 in  New York .

seventh day, dropping 1.6 percent to $10.40, the lowest since
