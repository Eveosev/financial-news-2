German municipalities, whose budget
accounts contribute to the country’s overall deficit, may
struggle to meet a pay claim lodged by public-sector unions, the
 Rheinische Post  newspaper reported, citing the head of the DStGB
town-council group.  German towns and local councils would be forced to cut
investment or jobs to fulfill the wage claim of 6.5 percent,
DStGB head Gerd Landsberg was cited as saying in a interview.  Germany ’s municipalities are empowered to seek short-term
loans in markets only and cannot determine local tax rates.
Wages make up the biggest part of their cumulative outlays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
