Robert M. Bass, the billionaire who
started investment firm Oak Hill Capital Partners, bought a co-
operative apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side for $42
million, according to city property records.  The 12th-floor unit is in a building at 834 Fifth Ave.
where News Corp. Chairman  Rupert Murdoch  and  Charles Schwab , the
founder of his namesake company, also own apartments, property
filings show.  Bass was ranked 88th on the 2011 Forbes list of the 400
richest Americans, with a net worth of $3.6 billion. The
apartment’s seller is listed as Damon Mezzacappa, chief
executive officer of Mezzacappa Management LLC and former vice
chairman of Lazard Freres & Co.  The limestone building near 64th Street, designed by
architect Rosario Candela and built in the early 1930s, has
fewer than 25 units and is “the epitome of privacy and
exclusivity,” according to a previous listing for another
apartment in the building.  Bass declined to comment on the purchase through a
spokeswoman, Marcia Horowitz. Damon Mezzacappa didn’t return a
message left at his Palm Beach, Florida, home.  Purchases of  Manhattan  luxury apartments, defined as the
top 10 percent of all sales by price, declined 13 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier to 201 deals, according to a
report last month by New York appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and
Prudential Douglas Elliman. The median price of those
transactions dropped 4.6 percent to $4.15 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
