Vanguard Group Inc., the world’s
biggest mutual fund company, attracted the most money among
mutual fund companies in January, according to  estimates  from
Morningstar Inc.  The firm, based in  Valley Forge ,  Pennsylvania , received
$13.6 billion, followed by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , whose funds won
$2.54 billion, Chicago-based Morningstar said today in a report.
DoubleLine Capital LP, founded by  Jeffrey Gundlach , had the
third-highest new deposits, with $2.36 billion.  Investors put $33.9 billion into U.S. mutual funds last
month, reversing redemptions of almost $10 billion in December,
Morningstar said. Domestic stock funds saw $2.75 billion in
withdrawals last month, while taxable bond funds attracted $24.6
billion, the most of any category.  Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world’s
largest mutual fund, had the fifth-biggest deposits with $1.9
billion. The numbers are for open-end mutual funds that reported
as of Feb. 9, and exclude money markets and fund of funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
