Kvaerner ASA (KVAER) , the Norwegian company
involved in engineering, procurement and construction, advanced
to the highest in seven months in Oslo trading after winning a
1.2 billion-krone ($210 million) contract from  Total SA. (FP)   Kvaerner climbed as much as 5.3 percent to 13.8 kroner, the
biggest intraday gain since Jan. 27 and the highest since July
14. The Fornebu, Norway-based company is up 39 percent in 2012.  The business won an engineering, procurement, supply and
construction contract from  Europe ’s third-largest oil company to
deliver a steel jacket for the Hild field, off the coast of
 Norway  in the first half of 2014. This is the second such
contract for Kvaerner, the unit spun off from Aker Solutions in
a listing in July, after winning a 1.1 billion-krone contract
last month from  Lundin Petroleum AB (LUPE)  for the Luno field.  It rose 3.8 percent to 13.6 kroner by 1:07 p.m. in Oslo.  It’s “positive to see two major contracts for Kvaerner so
far in 2012 after reporting poor order intake over the last
quarters,” Goeran Andreassen, an analyst at RS Platou Markets
AS, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. Andreassen recommends
investors buy the stock with a target price of 14 kroner.  The Hild field, with reserves estimated at 190 million
barrels of oil equivalent, is expected to begin output at the
end of 2016 and reach a peak 100,000 barrels a day, Total said
Feb. 2. Jackets are platform supports, installed underwater and
extending into the seabed, on which rest modules for production,
processing and crew accommodation, together known as topsides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
