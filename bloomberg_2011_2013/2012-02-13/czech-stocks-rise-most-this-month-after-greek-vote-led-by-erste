Czech stocks increased the most this
month, led by Austrian companies  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and Vienna
Insurance Group AG, after Greek lawmakers approved austerity
plans, boosting demand for riskier assets worldwide.  The  PX (PX)  equity gauge surged as much as 3.1 percent, the most
since Jan. 26 on an intraday basis, and was 2.5 percent higher
at 1,015.9 as of 10:55 a.m. in Prague. Erste and VIG, which
account for 36 percent of the  index , rose more than 4 percent.  Financial companies worldwide were among the biggest stock
gainers today as passage of the Greek austerity bill fuelled
optimism that euro-region finance ministers will on Feb. 15
approve a second bailout package to avert default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
