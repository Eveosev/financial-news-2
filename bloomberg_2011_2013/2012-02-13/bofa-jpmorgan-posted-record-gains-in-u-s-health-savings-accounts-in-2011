JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) , the two biggest U.S. banks by assets, added a
record number of health savings accounts they manage for workers
in 2011, the firms said.  Employers are increasing the use of so-called HSAs, which
are paired with high-deductible health insurance plans, to shift
more costs to U.S. workers. The accounts generally require
consumers to pay more out of pocket for health care and let them
save for medical expenses in their own accounts. Money
contributed can grow tax-free and carry over from year to year
or to another job.  Bank of America increased the number of HSAs it administers
by a record 34 percent last year to almost 200,000, totaling
more than $300 million in assets, according to a  statement  from
the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank today. JPMorgan added a
record number of new accounts in 2011, reaching more than
900,000 as of February compared with about 700,000 in 2010, said
Elena Szymanski, an  executive director  who manages the HSA
business for the New York-based firm. JPMorgan administers more
than $1.5 billion in HSA balances, the firm said in a report
also released  today .  “We continue to hear from our clients and customers about
health care,” Justin Raniszeski, health benefit solutions
executive for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a telephone
interview last week. “They need help affording health care and
controlling costs.”  Companies buying health coverage for workers spent the most
this year since 2005 and costs may reach $32,175 for a family in
2021, according to a September  report  by the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation in  Menlo Park ,  California , and the Chicago-
based American Hospital Association’s Health Research &
Educational Trust.  Costs Rise  The average cost of a family policy climbed 9 percent in
2011 to $15,073, with employees paying 28 percent of premiums,
according to the Kaiser survey. That compares with the average
premium for a high-deductible plan of $13,704 for a family.
Among workers offered health benefits, 17 percent are enrolled
in a high-deductible health plan with a savings option, compared
with 13 percent in 2010, according to the study.  To defray costs, companies are offering health benefits
with lower premiums and deductibles of at least $2,400 for a
family plan that are paired with a tax-free medical expense
account such as an HSA, the Kaiser survey showed.  “People are really starting to be able to use these as a
true savings vehicle,” JPMorgan’s Elena Szymanski, who is based
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview last week. “About 74
percent of folks out there contributed more than they spent.”  Rollovers Allowed  Money deposited in HSAs by individuals or their employers
generally isn’t taxed and may be kept in cash or invested.
Contributions are capped at $3,100 for an individual and $6,250
for families in 2012, according to  Internal Revenue Service
rules . Funds in HSAs may be rolled over from year to year and
accounts are portable if workers change jobs.  Average balances of HSAs administered by Bank of America
rose to more than $1,600 last year, a 10 percent increase from
2010, according to the statement. At JPMorgan the average HSA
balance increased 4 percent last year to $1,547, the report
showed.  While most HSA account holders keep their savings in cash
to spend on medical expenses during the year, more people are
investing funds as balances rise, said Szymanski. Last year
about 9 percent of individuals with an HSA investment account at
JPMorgan had a balance of more than $20,000, compared with 3
percent in 2009, she said.  Like 401(k)s  Individuals with HSAs at JPMorgan need at least $2,000
before they can start making investments, Szymanski said.
Account holders at Bank of America may invest money in excess of
$1,000, said Raniszeski.  “There will be a time where the menus are going to be
diverse like 401(k)s,” Kevin Crain, head of institutional
retirement and benefit services at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, said in a telephone interview referring to investment
options in HSAs. Other banks and mutual-fund firms including
 Wells Fargo & Co.  and Fidelity Investments also administer HSAs.  Earnings and withdrawals from the accounts are tax-free if
used for qualified medical expenses, otherwise there’s a 20
percent penalty, according to  IRS rules . After age 65 or
becoming disabled, account holders may take money out of their
HSAs for non-medical reasons without a penalty and pay ordinary
income tax on withdrawals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
