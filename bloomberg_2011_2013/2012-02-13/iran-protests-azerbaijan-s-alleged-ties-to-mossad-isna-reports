Iran ’s Foreign Ministry summoned the
Azeri ambassador in Tehran to protest alleged Israeli
intelligence activity in the oil-rich former Soviet republic,
state-run Iranian Students News Agency reported today.  The head of the Iranian Foreign Ministry department for
Commonwealth and Caucasus affairs handed a protest note to
Ambassador Cavansir Axundov after Azerbaijan “provided some
facilities to individuals to travel to Tel Aviv and cooperate
with Zionist spy networks,” ISNA said.  The Iranian official demanded that the Azeri government
prevent “ Mossad ’s espionage activities inside the country,”
according to the report.  Azerbaijan’s ties to Israel and the West have stoked
tensions with Iran. Azerbaijan said last month it thwarted a
terrorist plot against the Israeli ambassador in Baku by a group
linked to Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
