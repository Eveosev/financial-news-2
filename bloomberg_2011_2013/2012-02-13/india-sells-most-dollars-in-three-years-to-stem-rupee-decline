India’s central bank sold the most
foreign currency in three years in December, official data
showed, as the rupee plunged to a record against the dollar.  The  Reserve Bank  of India sold $7.81 billion in December,
according to a report  published  on its website today, the most
since October 2008. Central banks intervene in  currency markets 
by arranging purchases or sales of foreign exchange.  The rupee fell 16 percent last year, the worst performance
in Asia, as Europe’s debt crisis slowed global growth and damped
demand for emerging-market assets. It dropped to a record
54.3050 a dollar on Dec. 15. The currency has rebounded 7.9
percent in 2012 to 49.195 per dollar in Mumbai, after the
authorities took steps late last year to curb speculation and
volatility in the foreign-exchange market and attract foreign
investment.  Higher capital flows also boosted the rupee as  Greece 
continued negotiations aiming to secure an international
bailout. Overseas funds increased holdings of Indian shares by
$4 billion this year.  The government allowed foreign investors to buy $10 billion
more rupee-denominated bonds and opened up a part of India’s
retail sector to foreign-direct investment. The central bank
tightened rules on trading in the domestic currency-forwards
market, made it easier for Indian companies to borrow overseas,
and raised  interest rates  on local  bank deposits  owned by
Indians living abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
