Steel Authority of India Ltd. , the
nation’s second-biggest producer, reported a worse-than-expected
43 percent decline in third-quarter profit because of higher raw
material costs and a foreign-exchange loss.  Net  income  dropped to 6.32 billion rupees ($129 million) in
the three months ended Dec. 31 from 11.1 billion rupees a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement. The median of 32
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 7.87 billion rupees.
Sales fell 5 percent to 105.9 billion rupees.  The price of imported coking coal, a key raw material used
to make steel, jumped 17 percent, while the  Indian rupee  fell 16
percent in the last quarter from a year earlier. Steel Authority
imports about 70 percent of the coking coal it needs to fire its
blast furnaces. The price of hot-rolled coils rose 3.5 percent
in the period.  The company booked a one-time foreign-exchange loss of 4.66
billion rupees, compared with a gain of 331.6 million rupees a
year earlier. Raw material costs rose 14 percent to 59.9 billion
rupees, while employee expenses were little changed at 18.6
billion rupees, the company said. Power and fuel costs surged 27
percent to 11.3 billion rupees.  Shares (SAIL)  of New Delhi-based Steel Authority fell 2.6 percent
to 110.30 rupees at the close of trading in Mumbai. The  stock 
has risen 35 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent gain
in the key Sensitive Index.  Higher Spending  Steel Authority may increase its spending by 15 percent to
145 billion rupees in the year starting April 1, Chairman C.S. Verma told reporters today in  New Delhi . The company has cash
reserves of 86.7 billion rupees as of Dec. 31, he said.  Borrowings reached 199.25 billion rupees as of Dec. 31, of
which about 42 percent was in foreign currency, he said. Steel
Authority plans to borrow about 70 billion rupees in the year
ending March 31, 2013, he said, without giving details.  Demand for the alloy is expected to be “firm” and prices
should be “stable” in the fourth quarter, Verma said.
Production will probably reach 19 million tons in the next
fiscal year, he said.  The company’s volume sales fell 19 percent to 2.62 million
tons, while the average price climbed 17 percent to 37,326
rupees a ton in the third quarter from a year earlier, Verma
said.  India ’s steel ministry forecasts demand for the alloy,
which grew 9.9 percent in the last fiscal year, may rise at a
slower pace in the year that started April 1 as higher  interest
rates  curb demand for cars and homes.  A consortium led by Steel Authority in November won the
right to develop the biggest mining project in  Afghanistan . The
proposed iron ore mines at Hajigak may hold an estimated 1.8
billion metric tons of the steelmaking raw material.  To contact the reporter for this story:
