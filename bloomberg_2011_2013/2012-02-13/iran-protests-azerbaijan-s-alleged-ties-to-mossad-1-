Iran ’s Foreign Ministry summoned the
Azeri ambassador in Tehran to protest alleged Israeli
intelligence activity in the oil-rich former Soviet republic,
state-run Iranian Students News Agency reported today.  The Iranian Foreign Ministry’s department head for
Commonwealth and Caucasus affairs gave a note of protest to
Ambassador Cavansir Axundov after Azerbaijan “provided some
facilities to individuals to travel to Tel Aviv and cooperate
with Zionist spy networks,” ISNA said.  The Iranian official demanded the Azeri government prevent
 Mossad ’s “espionage activities” inside the country, the news
service said.  Azerbaijan dismissed the allegation. The Iranian move was
retaliation for an Azeri protest note issued last month over an
alleged plot by an Iranian-linked group to carry out terrorist
attacks in Baku, Elman Abdullayev, a spokesman for the Azeri
Foreign Ministry, said in a statement today.  Azerbaijan ’s ties to Israel and the West have stoked
tensions with Iran. Azerbaijan said last month it thwarted a
terrorist plot against the Israeli ambassador in Baku by a group
linked to Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
