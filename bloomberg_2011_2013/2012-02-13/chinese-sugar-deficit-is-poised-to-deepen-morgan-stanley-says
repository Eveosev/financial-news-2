The sugar deficit in  China , the
world’s second-largest consumer, will deepen in the coming
season as demand increases more quickly than supply, according
to Morgan Stanley.  The country’s sugar consumption will exceed production by
2.5 million metric tons in the 2012-13 season starting in
October, up from 2.3 million tons in 2011-12, the bank said in a
report e-mailed today. Demand will rise 1.9 percent to 16.3
million tons next season as output gains 0.6 percent to 13.8
million tons, it said.  “We expect Chinese import demand to remain robust,”
 Hussein Allidina , head of commodities research at Morgan Stanley
in  New York , said in the report. “China will likely continue
relying on imports to replenish state reserves and fill its own
domestic production shortfall.”  Global sugar supplies will outpace demand by 7.7 million
tons in the current season, the bank said. The surplus may fall
to 4.9 million tons in the 2012-13 period, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
