President  Barack Obama ’s proposed
budget would renew and extend a subsidy for renewable-energy
projects that helps pay for as much as 30 percent of development
costs, according to a solar lobbying group.  The 2013 budget released today would restore U.S. Treasury
Department grants that expired in December, a benefit that may
add as many as 37,000 solar jobs, Rhone Resch, president of the
Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a  statement  today.  The grants, known as the 1603 program, were enacted in 2009
to encourage investors to back renewable-energy projects. It’s
helped develop more than $24 billion worth of renewable energy
resources, the Washington-based lobbying group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
