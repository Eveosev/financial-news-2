Jordan received offers from two
groups of companies for a project that would desalinate water
from the Red Sea and help replenish the  Dead Sea , a spokesman at
the Ministry of Water and Irrigation said.  Two of the six groups that were qualified in 2011 to
compete submitted technical and financial offers, Adnan Zu’bi
said by telephone from Amman. The ministry will start talks in
April with the two groups, which he declined to identify.  A statement posted on the ministry’s website indicated that
the six qualified groups were a venture between Japan’s
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and  Acciona SA (ANA)  of Spain, Saudi Arabia’s ACWA
Power International, Jordan Red Sea Group, Egypt’s Orascom
Construction Industries, South Korea’s  Samsung C&T Corp. (000830)  and
China’s  Sinohydro Group Ltd. (SHYDRZ)   The project involves extracting 1.2 billion cubic meters of
water from the  Red Sea , of which 930 million cubic meters will
be desalinated and the rest will be channeled into the shrinking
Dead Sea, according to the ministry’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
