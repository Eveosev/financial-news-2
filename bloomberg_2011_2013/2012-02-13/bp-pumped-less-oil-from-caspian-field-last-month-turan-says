BP Plc (BP/)  pumped 710,000 barrels of oil
a day from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field in  Azerbaijan â€™s
section of the  Caspian Sea  last month, the Turan  news agency 
reported today, citing an unnamed official at the State Oil Co.
of Azerbaijan.  That compares with 757,000 barrels of oil a day produced
from the field, also known as ACG, in the first nine months of
2011, the report said.  Tamam Bayatli, a BP spokeswoman in the Azerbaijani capital
of Baku, said the company will release output figures for both
the ACG and Shah Deniz later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
