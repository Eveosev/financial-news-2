Henrique Capriles Radonski won a
landslide victory in  Venezuela ’s first ever presidential primary
to challenge President  Hugo Chavez  in October’s elections, the
head of the opposition’s electoral council said.  Miranda state Governor Capriles garnered 1.8 million of the
2.8 million valid votes counted, Teresa Albanes said today on
Globovision. Pablo Perez won 867,000 votes and Maria Corina
Machado had 103,000.  “Capriles, my good friend, count on me, you’ll be the next
president of Venezuela,” Perez said in Caracas on Globovision.
“There’s been a new leadership born.”  The opposition says the primary demonstrates their unity
after years of bickering and political blunders as they seek to
break Chavez’s 13-year hold on power in the Oct. 7 vote.
Capriles has vowed to maintain economic stability by keeping
some of the welfare benefits of Chavez’s “21st century
socialism” and only gradually dismantling state control.  The winning candidate said Feb. 7 that participation of 10
percent of the 18 million Venezuelans registered to vote would
give the opposition momentum as it starts an eight-month
campaign to return to power. The vote exceeded that figure by
more than 1 million.  “It resembles a national election more than a primary,”
Albanes said, according to a statement.  Hundreds of Capriles supporters gathered outside his
campaign headquarters in Caracas waving Venezuelan flags while
fireworks went off ahead of his victory speech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
