The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
144 basis points as of 12:10 p.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-
grade borrowers was little changed at 165 as of 8:52 a.m. in
 Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 148
basis points as of 9:36 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
