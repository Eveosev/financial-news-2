Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 0.13 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 2,351.85. The  CSI 300 Index  declined 0.1 percent to
2,531.98.  Banking stocks:  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016)  (600016 CH),
the nation’s first privately owned bank, fell 1.2 percent to
6.42 yuan. Huaxia Bank Co. (600015 CH), partly owned by Deutsche
Bank AG, slid 1.5 percent to 11.50 yuan.  Chinese banks extended 738.1 billion yuan ($117 billion) of
new yuan-denominated loans last month, the People’s Bank of
China said in a statement on Feb. 10 after the market closed.
That compares with the median forecast of 1 trillion yuan in a
Bloomberg News survey of 26 economists and 641 billion yuan in
December. M2, the broadest measure of  money supply , expanded
12.4 percent in January from a year earlier, the slowest pace in
more than a decade, it said.  Property stocks:  China Vanke Co. (000002)  (000002 CH), the nation’s
biggest listed property developer, slumped 1.9 percent to 7.70
yuan. Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048 CH), the second
largest, tumbled 3.1 percent to 10.57 yuan.  Gemdale Corp. (600383) 
(600383 CH) retreated 2.9 percent to 5.40 yuan.  The mid-sized city of Wuhu in Anhui province will
temporarily suspend a housing subsidy plan so it can study
details on how to implement the rules, according to a statement
on the local authority’s website yesterday. Wuhu will waive a
deed tax and subsidize some home purchases, it said Feb. 9,
becoming the first Chinese city this year to signal its
intention to ease property curbs.  Shuangliang Eco-Energy Systems Co. (600481)  (600481 CH), a maker of
sea water desalination equipment, jumped 4 percent to 8.24 yuan,
its highest close since Dec. 21. China will increase policy
support in the areas of fiscal and taxation, financial and
pricing for the sea water desalination industry and projects,
according to a State Council statement posted on the
government’s website today.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
