A court ruling sentencing Eternit
AG’s former owner and also the company’s biggest shareholder to
16 years in prison in connection with asbestos-related deaths is
“historic,”  Italy ’s health minister said.  “The ruling can be defined as truly historic as far as
both the social aspects and the legal aspects are concerned,”
Renato Balduzzi said in an e-mailed statement today. “The fight
against asbestos cannot end with a ruling, although a model one,
but has to continue.”  A court in Turin, in northern Italy, ruled today that Swiss
billionaire Stephan Schmidheiny andJean-Louis Marie Ghislain de Cartier, respectively Eternit’s former owner and its top
shareholder, were partially responsible for hundreds of deaths
and illnesses caused by asbestos in factories the company owned
in Italy. The two men were also sentenced to pay damages to be
determined in a separate civil proceeding to victims’ relatives
and to a number of local authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
