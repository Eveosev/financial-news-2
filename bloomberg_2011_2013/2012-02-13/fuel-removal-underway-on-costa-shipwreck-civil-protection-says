Salvage workers started removing
fuel from the wreck of the Costa Concordia cruise ship that ran
aground off the Italian coast a month ago.  The operation began at about 5 p.m. local time yesterday
and should take 28 working days to complete, providing the
weather is good, according to a statement published on the
Italian Civil Protection’s website. The ship is holding about
500,000 gallons of oil and workers aim to remove about 84
percent of it which is located in 15 tanks, said the authority.  Royal Boskalis Westminster NV’s Smit Salvage unit and its
Italian partner Neri SpA have undertaken the work.  Since the Concordia hit rocks near the island of Giglio on
Jan. 13 environmentalists have raised concerns that fuel leaks
may contaminate sea water and affect marine life. The Concordia
ran aground hours after leaving a port close to  Rome  with 4,200
passengers and crew. The accident killed at least 17 people.  Concordia’s Captain Francesco Schettino was placed under
house arrest on Jan. 17 for allegedly causing the shipwreck. No
formal charges have yet been filed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
