The Obama administration estimated
that auctions of airwaves would raise $16.2 billion under its
proposed federal budget for the next fiscal year, $11.6 billion
less than the year-earlier projection.  The estimate contained in President Barack Obama’s spending
proposal released today tracks with Congressional Budget Office
 calculations  that airwaves auctions included in legislation
passed by the House in December would bring in $16.7 billion.  Today’s estimate accounted for spending including helping
to set up a nationwide communications network for police,
firefighters and other emergency workers, Meg Reilly, a White
House spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The administration wants to devote more airwaves to
wireless high-speed  Internet service . It proposes paying
television station owners who voluntarily surrender unneeded
airwaves for auction, a plan that requires congressional
approval.  Lawmakers are trying to reconcile differing House and
Senate versions of bills authorizing the auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
