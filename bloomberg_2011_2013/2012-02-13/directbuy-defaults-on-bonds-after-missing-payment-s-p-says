DirectBuy Holdings Inc. defaulted on
$335 million of bonds after the consumer club missed a Feb. 1
interest payment, according to  Standard & Poor’s .  The consumer club is “highly unlikely” to make the
payment within the 30-day grace period allowed under the terms
of the bonds, prompting a downgrade to D from CC, S&P analysts
Helena Song and Andy Sookram said today in a statement.
Investors will likely receive a “modest recovery” of 10
percent to 30 percent of the debt’s face value, they wrote.  The 12 percent notes, issued in a private offering led by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in January 2011, were quoted today at a
mid-price of 21.5 cents on the dollar, according to a person
with knowledge of market prices for the debt. Merrillville,
Indiana-based DirectBuy sold the debt at 97 cents, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service cut its grade on DirectBuy to
Caa3 on Dec. 2 after the company defaulted on a financial
covenant tied to its bank credit line, received a going concern
opinion from its auditors and hired an adviser for a debt
restructuring, analysts Charles O’Shea and Kendra Smith wrote in
a statement.  Kevin McKeon, DirectBuy’s chief financial officer, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment. Song and Sookram of
S&P didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
