Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  wants to
expand its Husqvarna motorcycle brand in  Asia , the  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  BMW may seek partnerships with other producers, possibly in
 India , to produce parts or entire models, the newspaper said.  BMW hasn’t made a decision, the FTD cited the company’s
motorcycle unit chief Hendrik von Kuenheim as saying in a
preview of an article to be published tomorrow.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
