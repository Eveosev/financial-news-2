Technip SA (TEC)  intends to accelerate the
pace of growth now that the oil-services company has improved
profitability,  Les Echos  reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Thierry Pilenko.  Technip has made three acquisitions in the last year to
diversify its energy holdings, and while the CEO “wouldn’t rule
out” buying a competitor, his goal is to move into new markets
rather than working on a merger, the French newspaper cited
Pilenko as saying.  South Korean companies have become stiff competitors in the
Middle East, which is increasingly supplying oil for Asia,
Pilenko said, according to Les Echos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
