Investors holding 93.3 percent of PT
Cikarang Listrindo’s $300 million of 2015 bonds have agreed to
tender their securities, according to a statement from the
company today.  Cikarang offered to pay 110.75 cents each for the 9.25
percent notes, which will be funded by a new bond, according to
a tender offer by the Indonesian power provider. Holders that
didn’t agree will be left with amended notes, which allow
Cikarang to increase its debt and remove limits on dividend
payments. Investors couldn’t accept the buyback without agreeing
to the changes.  The company started marketing a U.S. dollar bond at a yield
of around 7.5 percent, according to a person familiar with the
matter. The bond has a tenor of seven years and can’t be
tendered in the first four, the person said, asking not to be
identified as the details are private.  Some existing investors in the 2015 bond were threatening
not to buy the new notes to protest Cikarang’s buyback terms.
They demanded that the new securities carry a clause stipulating
that any covenant amendments require authorization by 75 percent
of holders.  At least 40 percent of the 2015 bondholders have agreed not
to buy the proposed new notes unless these terms are met,
Singapore-based Scott Bennett, head of Asian credit at Aberdeen
Asset Management Plc, which owns 9 percent of the 2015 notes,
said today. Bennett oversees $1.5 billion of Asian fixed-income
securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
