The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency is investigating a well being drilled in western
 Pennsylvania  for possible violations of air, water or hazardous-
materials rules, an official said.  The agency began its inspections of the gas-drilling site,
which it declined to identify, in September, Bonnie Smith, an
EPA spokeswoman, said today in an interview. The investigation
is continuing, she said.  “Legitimate concerns have emerged about potential
environmental impact,” Smith said. Similar EPA investigations
unrelated to drilling are in progress in the mid-Atlantic
region, she said.  The investigation was disclosed today by the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, which reported that Washington County, south of
Pittsburgh, has more wells and compressor stations to pump
natural gas than any other county in the region.  The EPA is also testing water from wells in Dimock,
Pennsylvania, after residents in the community complained of
methane and chemical contamination from fracking for gas.  Hydraulic fracturing, technology that releases gas trapped
in shale rock by injecting water, sand and chemicals thousands
of feet underground, is used for almost every new natural-gas
well drilled on U.S. lands.  Drilling in the state’s portion of the gas-rich Marcellus
Shale formation could generate $20 billion for the state’s
economy by 2020, up from $13 billion last year, according to an
industry-funded study published by researchers from  Pennsylvania
State University .  To contact the reporter on this story:
