Australian equities fell after
Moody’s Investors Service cut the debt ratings of six European
countries including Italy, Spain and Portugal, reviving concern
about the region’s debt crisis. Japanese  stock   futures  were
little changed.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, slid
0.9 percent in Sydney.  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s largest
investment bank, fell 1 percent after it cut 10 percent of its
workforce in Asia last week, according to two people with
knowledge of the departures. American depositary receipts of
 Advantest Corp. (6857) , a Japanese maker of memory-chip testers, added
0.5 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo after a
measure that tracks the performance of  semiconductor companies 
climbed.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 0.2 percent today and
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.1 percent in Wellington.
Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in March
closed at 9,015 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,000 in
Osaka,  Japan . They were bid in the pre-market at 9,000 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time.  “The uncertainty over the euro area’s prospects for
institutional reform of its fiscal and economic framework” and
the resources that will be made available to deal with the
crisis, are among the main drivers of Moody’s action, the
ratings company said.  Bailout Package  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slipped 0.2
percent today. The index climbed 0.7 percent in  New York 
yesterday as Germany and the European Commission welcomed Greek
parliamentary approval of austerity steps demanded for a
financial lifeline, signaling euro-area finance chiefs tomorrow
will ratify a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion) package for the
debt-stricken nation.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 10.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 7.5 percent increase by the
 S&P 500  and a 7.6 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.1 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the S&P 500
and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  Sina Corp. gained, helping Chinese shares traded in New
York to a five-month high, after analysts recommended buying the
nation’s Internet companies as users climb and their stock
trades cheaper than peers in the U.S. The Bloomberg China-US 55
Index of the most-traded Chinese equities in the U.S. gained 1.6
percent to 106.72 at the close in New York, the highest since
Aug. 31.  Macquarie Group, which is mainly cutting vice presidents
and some junior positions, will keep an investment banking
presence in 14 countries in  Asia , one of the two people familiar
with the situation said. Macquarie said on Feb. 7 that slumping
advisory fees will contribute to a 25 percent drop in profit for
in the year ending March 31.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks the
performance of 30 industry stocks, rose 0.4 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
