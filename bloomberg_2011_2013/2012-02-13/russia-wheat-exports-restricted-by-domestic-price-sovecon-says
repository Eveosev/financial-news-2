(Corrects terms in second paragraph.)  Russia  lost the latest wheat tender
in  Egypt  because it offered the cereal for nearly 12 percent
more than the winning bid from the U.S., SovEcon  said  on its
website.  Russia’s price was $292.75 a metric ton, compared with $262
a ton for U.S. wheat on a so-called free-on-board basis with
delivery in April, according to the Moscow-based agricultural
researcher.  Egypt bought 55,000 tons of wheat from the U.S. in a tender
over the weekend, according to Nomani Nomani, vice chairman of
the state-run  General Authority  for Supply Commodities.  Russia’s grain stocks in the south are falling, which
raised the cost, Andrei Sizov, SovEcon’s managing director, told
Bloomberg in Moscow today. Traders have to buy more affordable
grains from other regions further from the Black Sea port of
Novorossiysk, which increases transportation costs, he said. The
ruble strengthening also made the export price less attractive,
he said.  “It is interesting that there was just one proposal of
grain from Russia in the Egyptian tender last week,” Sizov
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
