President  Barack Obama  proposed
cutting the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget for the
third straight year by trimming funding for water grants to U.S.
states and Superfund clean-up programs.  The fiscal 2013 budget seeks $8.3 billion, which is $105
million below the current funding level for the agency,
according to White House documents released today. If Congress
approves the proposal, it would be the first time since 1994
that the agency’s budget was cut for three consecutive years.  After EPA funding reached a record $11 billion in 2010,
Obama’s budget, for the year starting Oct. 1, would still leave
agency spending higher than during any previous administration,
according to figures included in the budget documents.  The budget calls for $33 million in cuts to pay for the
clean-up of sites with hazardous materials under the Superfund
program. And it cuts the amount available for grants to states
for wastewater or drinking water projects to $1.2 billion from
$1.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
