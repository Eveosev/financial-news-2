The  Development Bank  of Ethiopia
will lend Saygim B.M. Capital Technology Group of Turkey 1.42
billion Ethiopian birr ($82 million) to help build a cable
factory outside the capital,  Addis Ababa ,  Capital  newspaper
reported.  The advance will cover about half the cost of the plant to
be built 24 kilometers (15 miles) outside the city this year,
the newspaper said, citing Tadesse Hatiya, the state-owned
lenderâ€™s vice president for credit services.  Turkish investments in Ethiopian industries including
construction, leather and textiles are worth $1.5 billion, the
Ethiopian Radio and Television Agency said in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
