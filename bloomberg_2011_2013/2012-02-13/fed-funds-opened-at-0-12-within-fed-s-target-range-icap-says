Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.12 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.11 percent on Feb. 10 after trading
from 0.05 percent to 0.18 percent and averaging 0.12 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire $1.5 billion to $2 billion of
Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to November 2041. The
purchases are the first in the Fed’s new program to replace $400
billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term
Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs further and
counter rising risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
