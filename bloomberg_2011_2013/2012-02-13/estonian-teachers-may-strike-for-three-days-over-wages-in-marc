Estonian teachers and day-care
workers will strike for as long as three days next month after
talks with the government over wages broke down.  The strike will start on March 7, with the duration to be
set later, Sven Rondik, head of  Estonia ’s Education Personnel
Union, said today in a statement.  The union wants a 20 percent increase in teachers’ wages in
2012 and 15 percent in both 2013 and 2014, according to its
 website . This year’s move would bring gross monthly salaries up
to 730 euros ($965) from 608 euros for junior teachers and to
1,067 euros from 889 euros for the most senior teachers.  Average
monthly wages  in Estonia were 809 euros in the third quarter.  The union has repeatedly criticized the government for
freezing teachers’ salaries, protesting at parliament in October
after the Cabinet rejected wage demands while the Baltic nation
grew at the fastest pace in the 27-member European Union. This
year’s budget doesn’t allow for an increase in teachers’ wages,
according to the government, which is planning a deficit of 2.1
percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
