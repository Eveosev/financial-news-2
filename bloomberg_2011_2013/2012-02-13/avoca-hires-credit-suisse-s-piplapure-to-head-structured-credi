Avoca Capital Holdings, a Dublin-
based investment firm overseeing 6 billion euros ($8 billion),
hired Vaibhav Piplapure from Credit Suisse Group AG to head its
structured and illiquid credit unit.  Piplapure will be based in  London  and report to Chief
Operating Officer Clayton Perry, said Daniel Kahn, an external
spokesman for the  fund manager . Piplapure will initially manage
allocations to Avoca’s 500 million-euro credit opportunities
fund, and the firm plans to raise additional cash for him to
manage, according to an e-mailed statement.  “The European credit environment is undergoing profound
long-term change, primarily driven by the diminishing role of
banks,” Perry said in the statement.  Piplapure was previously the head of asset finance for
 Europe  in Credit Suisse’s securitized products group, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
