Google Inc.’s (GOOG)   encrypted search,
Gmail, Google Videos and YouTube have been blocked in  Iran  since
Feb. 10, the company said in an e-mailed response to a query.  More than 30 million Iranian  Internet users  have been
unable to access e-mail accounts, including Gmail and Microsoft
Corp.’s Hotmail, the state-run Mehr news agency said on Feb. 11.  Iran’s Information Technology Organization and the
Telecommunication Infrastructure Co. have said they are unaware
of the issue, Mehr said. The head of the former, Saeed Mahdioun,
said any problems wouldn’t fall under his group’s
responsibilities, adding that he doesn’t use foreign e-mail
services, according to Mehr.  To contact the reporters on this story:
