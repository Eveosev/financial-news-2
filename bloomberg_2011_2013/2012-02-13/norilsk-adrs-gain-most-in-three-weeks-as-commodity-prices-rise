OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY)  gained the
most in three weeks in New York as the world’s largest producer
of nickel and palladium said metal prices will rise this quarter
and Greece’s approval of an austerity plan boosted the outlook
for  Europe , the company’s largest customer.  Norilsk’s American depositary receipts climbed 4.8 percent
to $19.54 at 12:42 p.m. in New York, the biggest intraday gain
since Jan. 25.  Shares (GMKN)  in Moscow rose 3.5 percent on the  Micex (INDEXCF)  to
5,825 rubles, or $194.71. One ADR represents one-tenth of an
ordinary share. Norilsk ADRs have advanced 27 percent this year
after losing 36 percent in 2011.  Moscow-based Norilsk sees metals prices rising this quarter
as investment demand rebounds, according to Anton Berlin, head
of marketing. Norilsk plans to increase nickel production at
mines in Africa and  Australia  this year, Berlin said in an
interview in Moscow.  Commodities (SPGSCI)  rose after Greek lawmakers
approved a budget-cutting plan, bolstering chances for a
solution to Europe’s debt crisis.  “Commodity prices have been rebounding since the beginning
of the year, and that’s been very helpful for Norilsk,” said
Alexander Pukhaev, an analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow, in a
phone interview. “The better news flow out of Europe today is
also very positive as sentiment improves about global growth.”
Pukhaev has a “hold” rating on Norilsk.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI index  of 24 raw materials rose 0.6
percent to 677.57. Nickel, which fell 0.7 percent to $20,565 a
ton on the London Metal Exchange, has gained 9.9 percent this
year. European sales  comprised  more than half of Norilsk’s 2010
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
