Economists at Chile’s central bank
stressed the recent better-than-expected news on the global
economy, such as the January U.S. jobless report, one day before
policy makers meet for their next rate decision.  “More calm has been seen in markets, with a decline in
risk premiums, a generalized appreciation of currencies against
the  U.S. dollar  and an increase in the price of raw materials,”
the bank’s research department said in a report on the
institution’s website today.  Domestically, the biggest surprise was the 5.3 percent
increase in economic activity in December from the previous
year, the researchers said. Chile’s gross domestic product may
have grown 6.3 percent last year, the fastest expansion in more
than a decade, according to the report.  Still, growth in domestic demand is showing some signs of
moderating, while inflation eased to 4.2 percent in January, in
line with estimates, the economists wrote. Two-year inflation
forecasts are anchored about the bank target, even as one-year
estimates grew “in the margin,” economists said.  Chile ’s central bank targets annual inflation of 3 percent,
plus or minus 1 percentage point over 24 months. Two-year
breakeven inflation, which is derived by the difference between
nominal and inflation-indexed yields, was 3.09 percent today.  Chile’s peso fell 0.2 percent to 479.8 per dollar today
from 478.80 on Feb. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
