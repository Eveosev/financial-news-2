British retail investors pumped a
record 1.9 billion pounds ($3 billion) into index-linked funds
in 2011, as low  interest rates  encouraged savers to quit holding
cash.  Net sales of the so-called tracker funds rose 10 percent
from the 1.7 billion pounds in 2010, the  Investment Management
Association  said today in an e-mailed statement. U.K. funds
under management dropped 0.3 percent to 571 billion pounds.  “You can’t get an inflation-beating yield from cash so
we’ve got lots of investors looking for yield from equity and
bond passive funds,” said Danny Cox, head of advice at
 Hargreaves Lansdown Plc (HL/) , the U.K.’s biggest retail broker.
“There has been a lot of noise about charges and performance.
If you are dipping your toe into the equity markets for the
first time then a tracker is a decent place to start.”  Index-lined funds, which mirror specified benchmarks such
as the FTSE 100 Index of leading U.K. stocks, make up about 7
percent of the U.K.’s total funds under management. Their annual
charges can be as little as a tenth of actively managed funds,
according to Hargreaves Lansdown. The  Bank of England  last week
kept its interest rate at a record-low of 0.5 percent.  About 66 percent of actively managed U.K. funds
underperformed their MSCI index benchmarks in the first 10
months of 2011, according to Vanguard Group Inc., which manages
$1 trillion in U.S. mutual-fund assets and specializes in index-
linked funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
