OAO Sberbank (SBER) ,  Russia ’s largest
lender, may sell bonds in Swiss francs after the successful sale
of $1.5 billion bonds earlier this month,  Kommersant  said,
citing Deputy Chief Executive Officer Andrey Donskikh.  Sberbank hired  UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and Troika
Dialog to market the potential sale and has started meeting
investors, the Moscow-based daily said.  The book for Sberbank’s dollar bonds was oversubscribed,
according to Kommersant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
