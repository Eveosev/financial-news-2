Bahrain’s energy minister said he
would prefer  oil prices  to remain close to current levels, which
allow producers to invest in output capacity without putting
economic growth in the west at risk.  Prices of $110 a barrel or more may “derail recoveries in
a number of fragile Western economies,” Abdul Hussain Ali Mirza
said yesterday in an e-mailed response to questions. Bahrain is
a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, along with  Saudi
Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates.  “Bahrain, along with the other producers within GCC
prefers to see the prices return to more reasonable levels, say
around the $100 a barrel range,” the minister said. “Such
prices would ease the West out of the economic problem and at
the same time would incentivize the producing nations to invest
in the necessary infrastructure to increase their producing
capability.”  Brent crude  averaged about $112.73 a barrel this year on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London , while West Texas
Intermediate futures traded at an average of $99.68 on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  in the same period.  Bahrain, the smallest oil producer in the Persian Gulf, is
seeking to boost output of both crude oil and natural gas.
Bahrain Petroleum Co., the state-run refiner, increased
production to a monthly record of 271,300 barrels of oil a day
in November, topping the previous record of 270,300 barrels in
May 2008, Mirza said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
