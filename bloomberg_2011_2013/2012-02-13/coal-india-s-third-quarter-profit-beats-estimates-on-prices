Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s largest
producer of the fuel, posted a 54 percent increase in third-
quarter profit, beating analysts’ estimates, after increasing
prices and production.  Net income  climbed to 40.4 billion rupees ($821 million),
or 6.39 rupees a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 from
26.3 billion rupees, or 4.16 rupees, a year earlier, Coal  India 
said in a stock exchange filing yesterday. The median estimate
of 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of 36.4
billion rupees. Sales rose 21 percent to 153.5 billion rupees.  The company produces more than 80 percent of the country’s
coal and plans to boost output to meet demand from power plants
and  steel mills  in  Asia ’s second-fastest growing major economy.
Coal India, based in Kolkata, raised prices in February 2011 and
said it expects to add 62 billion rupees in revenue this
financial year.  “Coal prices bumping up by around 21 percent have
certainly had a hand in a result that’s surprised the market,”
said Chetan Kapoor, a Mumbai-based analyst with IDBI Capital
Market Services.  Coal India  shares  rose 1.4 percent to 336.60 rupees at the
close in Mumbai, the highest level since Jan. 27. The  stock ,
which was sold at 245 rupees apiece in October 2010 in the
country’s biggest initial public offering, has gained 12 percent
this year, compared with a 15 percent increase in the benchmark
 Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   Wage Increase  The state-owned company agreed to raise gross wages by 25
percent and basic salaries by 4 percent for non-executive
workers with effect from July 2011, which may cost it about 65
billion rupees annually. The government has said it would ask
Coal India not to raise prices to cover the wage increase agreed
in January.  A provision for the wage increase has been considered in
the quarter and the final impact of the accord will be accounted
for in the fourth quarter, Coal India said.  Production was 114.6 million metric tons compared with
113.8 million tons a year earlier, according to the filing.
Output in the first nine months of the year dropped to 291.2
million tons from 299.5 million tons.  The development of new mines has been hindered by heavy
rains and delays in acquiring land and getting environmental
approvals.  India’s coal demand is expected to climb 41 percent to 981
million tons in the next five years, according to estimates by
the Planning Commission. Output may rise 28 percent to 715
million tons in this period.  The nation plans to add 100,000 megawatts of electricity
generation capacity during the period, more than half of which
will use coal, according to the power ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
