China , estimated to hold more gas
trapped in shale than the U.S., may hold its second auction of
exploration areas as early as this month, according to an
official at the Ministry of Land and Resources.  The ministry plans to hold the tender by the end of
February or in early March, Zhang Dawei, deputy director of oil
and gas research at the ministry, said by telephone today. The
sale was originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2011.  China, yet to produce shale gas commercially, may hold
about 31 trillion cubic meters of the resource, Xinhua News
Agency reported, citing Wang Min, vice minister of land, at a
national geological survey conference in Beijing yesterday.
Chinese reserves may reach 1,275 trillion cubic feet (36
trillion cubic meters), according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration in April. That’s almost triple the 482 trillion
cubic feet in U.S., according to a Jan. 23 estimate by the EIA.  Shale-gas output may exceed 100 billion cubic meters in
2020, Xinhua said, citing Wang. China aims to produce 80 billion
cubic meters annually by 2020, Zhang said in October, citing the
draft of a national plan on the resource.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.  and Henan Provincial Coal
Seam Gas Development and Utilization Co. won rights to explore
two areas in the country’s first shale-gas auction in June. The
land ministry will likely offer more than 20 blocks in the
second round, Zhang said Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
