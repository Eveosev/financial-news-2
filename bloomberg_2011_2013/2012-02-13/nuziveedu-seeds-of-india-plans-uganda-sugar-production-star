Nuziveedu Seeds Pvt Ltd., an Indian
company that’s the world’s third-largest cotton-seed producer,
is exploring plans to start sugar production in  Uganda , the
nation’s presidency said.  The company plans to form a venture with Sango Bay Estates
Ltd., a closely held Ugandan business, in the southwestern
district of Rakai to produce the sweetener, the president’s
office said by e-mail yesterday from Kampala, the capital.  Clearance for the project is subject to the government
completing land surveys to ascertain its size, the presidency
said in the statement.  Nuziveedu Seeds is based in the southern Indian state of
 Andhra Pradesh . Sango Bay produced sugar in Uganda until 1972,
when former dictator Idi Amin expelled Asian business owners,
Henry Musisi, the operations manager, said today by phone from
Kampala. The owners repossessed the company in the late 1990s,
he said.  Sugar production by Uganda’s three top planters, which
account for more than 98 percent of annual output, may climb 28
percent to 346,000 metric tons this year because of forecasts of
good weather, the Uganda Sugar Cane Technologists Association
said on Jan. 24.  Encroachers took over part of Sango Bay’s 12,000 acres
(4,856 hectares) planned for cane growing and the government is
trying to resolve the issue, Musisi said.  Sango Bay planted 800 hectares of seed and is waiting for
the government to rid it of encroachers before they embark on
cane growing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
