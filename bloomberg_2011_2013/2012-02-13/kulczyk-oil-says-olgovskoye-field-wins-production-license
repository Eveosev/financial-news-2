Kulczyk Oil Ventures Inc., an
exploration company owned by Polish billionaire  Jan Kulczyk ,
said that Ukrainian authorities allowed it to change the status
of its Olgovskoye license from exploratory to producing.  “The conversion of the license means that the company is
no longer obliged to limit output to 10 percent of its
reserves,” Kulczyk Oil said today in a regulatory statement.  The Olgovskoye permit, the most productive from five the
company has to explore for oil and gas in Ukraine, is valid for
20 years and has output of 12 million cubic feet of gas per day,
according to the statement.  The company in November said its unit completed the first
hydraulic fracturing at the Olgovskoye-6 well.  Shale gas development, where rock formations are
horizontally drilled and broken apart using water, chemicals and
sand under high pressure in a process known as hydraulic
fracturing, has driven a surge in U.S. gas output and damped
prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
