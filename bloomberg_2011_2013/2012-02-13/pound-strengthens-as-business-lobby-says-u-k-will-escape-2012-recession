The pound rose for the first time in
four days against the dollar after the  Confederation of British
Industry  said the U.K. will escape a technical recession this
year, avoiding the need for more  Bank of England  stimulus.  Sterling was within one yen of the strongest in almost
three months after the business lobby group said growth is
resuming and “will pick up” during 2012. The forecast followed
reports this month that showed a gauge of service activity
climbed and  house prices  increased. The FTSE 100 Index of stocks
advanced 0.8 percent, as Greek lawmakers approved austerity
measures to obtain a financial rescue package.  “A lot of bearish news is priced into the pound,” said
Audrey Childe-Freeman, global head of currency strategy at
JPMorgan Private Bank in London. “Some of the U.K. data has
been slightly better than expected recently, so we might have a
period of wait-and-see from the BOE. A more favorable risk
environment is helping the pound against the dollar.”  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.5778 at 4:32 p.m.
London time after falling 0.4 percent last week. Sterling was
little changed at 122.25 yen after rising to 123.18 yen on Feb.
10, the strongest since Nov. 14. It was also little changed at
83.76 pence per euro.  ‘Signs of Optimism’  “Growth is starting again because we’ve got tentative
signs of optimism,” CBI Director-General  John Cridland  said in
a Bloomberg interview on Feb. 10. “We’re not assuming in our
growth forecasts that there will be a further package of QE,”
he said, referring to the Bank of England’s quantitative-easing
program of bond purchases.  The pound has declined 1.4 percent this year according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. Sterling has fallen 4 percent in
the past 12 months.  An  index of U.K. services  rose to 56 in January, the most
since March, from 54 in December, Markit Economics and the
 Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said Feb. 3. House
prices climbed 0.6 percent in January, Halifax said Feb. 6.  The BOE announced an additional 50 billion-pound round of
bond purchases on Feb. 9 after gross domestic product fell 0.2
percent in the last three months of 2011. The Monetary Policy
Committee held its benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 0.5
percent the same day.  The stimulus is aimed at preventing inflation falling below
the central bank’s 2 percent target amid what it says is a
“weak outlook” for growth.  Inflation Slowed  Inflation slowed in January to the least since November
2010, according to a Bloomberg survey before the Office for
National Statistics report tomorrow. Consumer prices rose an
annual 3.6 percent after a 4.2 percent gain in December, the
survey showed. The central bank will release new economic and
inflation forecasts on Feb. 15.  The yield on the  10-year gilt  increased one basis point to
2.12 percent. The 3.75 percent bond due September 2021 dropped
0.105, or 1.05 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 114.015.
The two-year yield was little changed at 0.39 percent.  The pound may weaken as much as 9 percent against the
dollar during the next three months, should it decline below a
level of support, SEB AB said, citing trading patterns.  Sterling may drop to $1.44 if it falls below its 55-day
moving average, Stockholm-based chief technical analyst Anders Soederberg said today by telephone.  “If we manage to break out of the current range, we could
rapidly end up at $1.44-$1.45,” he said.  The pound’s 55-day moving average is $1.5603. Sterling last
traded at $1.44 in June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
