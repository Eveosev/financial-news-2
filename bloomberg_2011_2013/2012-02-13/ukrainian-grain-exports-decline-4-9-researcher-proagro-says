Ukrainian grain exports fell 4.9
percent in this monthâ€™s first nine days, ProAgro said, without

today by e-mail.  Wheat deliveries plunged 55 percent to 40,480 tons, and the
grain was exported to Jordan and  Spain , ProAgro said. Corn
shipments rose 30 percent to 286,890 tons, and the grain was
delivered to  South Korea , Taiwan and Egypt. Ukraine also shipped
6,000 tons of barley to Israel.  About 1.2 million tons of grains are to be shipped soon,
including 768,300 tons of corn, 351,400 tons of wheat and 47,500
tons of barley, ProAgro said, citing preliminary port figures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
