percent to 4 shillings, a record low, on investors’ concern over
the extent of the drop in its profits.  “What investors are not really sure about is whether it is
just going to break even or is it really bad news,” Eric Musau,
a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank
Ltd., said by phone today. “We are seeing negative sentiment
around the insurance sector because they rely a lot on
investment income.”  United Bank for Africa Plc  (UBA NL), a Nigerian lender with
operations in 19 countries, retreated the maximum 5 percent to
1.72 naira, the weakest level since October 2003  The lender
said Feb. 8 it expects to report a loss for the 2011 financial
year and suspended a planned share sale the following day,
citing unfavourable market conditions.  “There was a huge sell out of the stock, which put it
under pressure,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based Sub-Saharan
Africa banking analyst at  Renaissance Capital , said by phone
today. “This could be linked mainly to the profit warning
issued by the bank last week.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
