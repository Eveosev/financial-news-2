The European Union wants greater
regulatory control over so-called shadow banks, the  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported, citing a draft memo from  Michel Barnier , the bloc’s financial services chief.  Regulatory options include additional requirements on
relations between banks and shadow banks, extending existing
laws and designing new ones, the FTD said.  Barnier plans to release the memo in March, the newspaper
said in a preview of an article to be published tomorrow.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
