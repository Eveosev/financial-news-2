The Pentagon’s proposed budget for
next year calls for buying 29 of  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35
Joint Strike Fighters, two fewer than this year’s purchase.  The Defense Department would pay $9.17 billion for the
planes, the military’s costliest weapons program, according to a
Pentagon budget document released today by the Center for
Defense Information, a policy group in Washington.  The budget proposal being sent to Congress today by
President Barack Obama includes $178.8 billion to procure
weapons programs, including research and development funding.  The number of heavy tactical vehicles to be purchased for
the Army would be scaled back from 9,336 this year to 1,534 in
fiscal 2013, which begins Oct. 1. That amounts to a savings of
$592.3 million.  The budget provides $9.7 billion for ballistic missile
defense programs, down from $10.4 billion this year.  The Navy would get $781.7 million for the first year of
construction of the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier, to be
built by  Huntington Ingalls Inc. (HII)  of Newport New, Virginia, as
part of a plan to preserve a fleet of 11 carriers.  The Navy also would buy another two Virginia-class attack
submarines, for $4.26 billion. Submarines are built jointly by
 General Dynamics Corp. (GD) ’s Electric Boat shipyard in Groton,
Connecticut and Huntington Ingalls.  The Pentagon would double the number of  Northrop Grumman
Corp. (NOC)  RQ-4 Global Hawk drones it buys next year, purchasing six
of the unmanned planes for $1.25 billion, up from three drones
this year.  The budget also provides $1.96 billion to buy 21 of the
V-22 Ospreys, a tilt-rotor aircraft that flies like a plane and
takes off like a helicopter. That is 14 fewer aircraft than were
purchased this year. The V-22 is made by  Boeing Company (BA)  and the
Bell Helicopter unit of  Textron Inc. (TXT)   To contact the reporter on this story:
