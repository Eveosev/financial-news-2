British-American Investments Co. (BRIT) , a
Kenyan financial-services group, headed for a record low on
investors’ concern over the extent of the drop in its profits.  The stock dropped as much as 2.5 percent before ending the
day 1.2 percent lower at 4 shillings in Nairobi, the capital,
the lowest since the shares began trading on Sept. 9, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The reporting season in  Kenya 
begins this month for financials.  “What investors are not really sure about is whether it is
just going to break even or is it really bad news,” Eric Musau,
a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank
Ltd., said by phone today. “We are seeing negative sentiment
around the insurance sector because they rely a lot on
investment income.”  Over 65 percent of British-American’s earnings is
attributable to its investment income, Renaldo d’Souza, a
research analyst with Genghis Capital Ltd., said by phone from
Nairobi on Feb. 10. Income the company generates from all its
investments is expected to plunge to below 14 percent in 2011
from 41 percent a year earlier, d’Souza said.  The Kenyan financial services group said Jan.  10  its
annual profit is expected to fall at least 25 percent after the
value of its equity portfolio dropped. Stock is down 20 percent
since the announcement.  Kenyan stocks plunged 30 percent in 2011, the second-worst
performing in  Africa , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Egypt  fell the most, down 49 percent. The local stock market is
up 0.8 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
