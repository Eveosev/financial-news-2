Iraq  may prevent  Exxon Mobil  Corp.
from bidding in a new energy exploration round if it refuses to
rescind agreements with the country’s semi-autonomous Kurdish
region, according to a spokesman for Deputy Prime Minister for
Energy Affairs Hussain al-Shahristani.  “Iraq will ban Exxon Mobil from taking part in the fourth
round if it persists in its position to make deals with the
Kurdistan Regional Government,” Faisal Abdallah said in a
telephone interview in Baghdad today. He confirmed that Iraqi
authorities had not yet taken a final decision on the matter.  Iraq is waiting for Exxon to “take the right decision”
and rescind the contract it signed with Kurdish authorities,
Shahristani said in an interview yesterday. He called Exxon’s
agreement with the Kurds illegal.  Iraq’s central government has so far refused to recognize
production-sharing agreements between foreign companies and
Kurdistan, home to about 40 percent of Iraq’s 115 billion
barrels of reserves. The central government insists on service
contracts with foreign companies and that it needs to pre-
approve agreements concerning the country’s energy resources.  Exxon, which has not commented publicly on the matter,
operates with Royal Dutch Shell Plc in southern Iraq at the West
Qurna field, one of the nation’s biggest.  To contact the reporters on this story:
