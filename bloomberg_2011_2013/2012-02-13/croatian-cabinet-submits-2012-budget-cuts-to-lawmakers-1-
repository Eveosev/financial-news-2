Croatia’s government  submitted its
2012 budget draft to the Parliament, which includes 4 billion
kuna ($700 million) in proposed cuts to narrow the deficit and
to bolster the country’s credit ratings.  The government revised its budget gap forecast for this
year to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product, less than a
previous forecast of 4.2 percent and from 5.5 percent in 2011,
Finance Minister Slavko Linic told reporters in Zagreb today.
The cost-cutting should affect all branches of the public sector
as budget spending is cut to 118.8 billion kuna, from last
year’s 122.3 billion kuna.  “This is not the ideal budget proposal, but it’s the best
we could do,” Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic  said today at the
Cabinet meeting in Zagreb. “This budget will not lead to an
explosion in investment, but without the adopted measures we
can’t go forward.”  Croatia, which is set to become the European Union’s 28th
member in 2013, is facing a review of its  credit rating  as it
needs to service a growing external debt and revive its
faltering economy. Milanovic last month said the economy will
grow 0.8 percent this year, while central bank Governor Zeljko Rohatinski said in December the country may slide into recession
again this year after a modest recovery in 2011.  Asset Sales  The government expects to gain 2 billion kuna from selling
state assets this year, Linic said. The  budget deficit  in 2013
is forecast to narrow to 3.3 percent of GDP and to 2.6 percent
in 2014, Linic said. The government projects expenditures at 120
billion kuna in 2013 and 122.6 billion kuna in 2014.  The  International Monetary Fund  said in a Feb. 6 statement
that “with current policies” the economy will probably decline
by 1 percent this year and urged the government to continue
spending cuts and reduce the number of employees and benefits in
the public administration.  Standard & Poor’s  lowered Croatia’s credit rating a year
ago to BBB-, one step above junk, citing a “deteriorated fiscal
position and continuously weak” external financing.  Fitch Ratings  said on Dec. 5 it will review its assessment
in the first quarter in 2012, when it expects to have more
information on the government’s fiscal and economic program.  The government plans achieve economic expansion of 0.8
percent by boosting competition and domestic demand, rather than
exports, to limit the effect of the sovereign debt crisis in the
euro area, where  Croatia  exports 42 percent of its products,
Linic said in a Bloomberg interview on Jan. 31.  Croatia plans to sell at least $1.3 billion in bonds to
Japanese and U.S. investors this year, starting by the end of
the first quarter, Linic said. The government may borrow as much
as 17 billion kuna this year, down from 22 billion last year, he
said earlier. Croatia must pay 8.4 billion kuna to service this
year’s debt, including a bond of 500 million euros ($663
million) maturing in May.  The government will also raise from March 1 the value-added
 tax rate  to 25 percent from 23 percent to boost revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
