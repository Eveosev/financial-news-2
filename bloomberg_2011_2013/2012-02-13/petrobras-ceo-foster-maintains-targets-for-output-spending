Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil producer, is maintaining plans to more than
double oil production by 2020 as it pursues the biggest spending
plan in the oil industry.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
doesn’t plan to boost spending as it revises its $224.7 billion,
five-year investment plan, Maria das Gracas Foster said at a
press conference today as she took over as the company’s chief
executive officer in a swearing-in ceremony.  “Production targets are a priority for Petrobras,” Foster
said. “Increasing investments is not the plan.”  Petrobras plans to more than double oil and natural-gas
output to the equivalent of 6.4 million barrels a day by 2020,
which would make Brazil the second-largest producer in the
Americas behind the U.S. The company is developing the largest
discoveries in the Americas in over three decades that sit in
deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
