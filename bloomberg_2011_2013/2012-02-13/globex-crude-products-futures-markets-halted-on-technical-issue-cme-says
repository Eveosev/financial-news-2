CME Group Inc. (CME)  halted Globex crude
and products markets “due to technical issues,” according to a
notice posted on the company’s  website .  All-day and session orders on CME’s crude complex futures
and options markets, including GTDs, or Good-Til-Date, with
today’s date, will be canceled, the Chicago-based company said
in a later notice. All GTCs, or Good-Til-Canceled, that have
been acknowledged will remain working, CME said.  Settlement prices for New York Mercantile Exchange crude
oil and petroleum products futures and options will be based on
floor trading information today, CME said in a later statement.  Globex crude and products trading was to resume at 3:15
p.m. New York time, the Nymex parent said in the bulletin on its
website. Trading was taking place at 3:21 p.m.  CME market participants clear an average volume of 1.5
million energy contracts daily on CME Globex, through CME
ClearPort or on the trading floor, according to CME’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
