Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened
after ConocoPhilips reported a process upset at the Borger
refinery in  Texas .  The 154,000-barrel-a-day plant flared gases yesterday after
the issue, according to a filing with state regulators. Citgo
Petroleum Corp. reported a unit upset at the Corpus Christi
refinery, according to a notice by the local emergency planning
committee Feb. 10.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the

according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
2.67 cents to $2.9716 a gallon.  The Corpus Christi plant can process 165,000 barrels of
crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The same fuel in  New York Harbor (MOSNY87P)  held at a premium of 1.38
cents a gallon.  Operations at PBF Energy Inc.’s Delaware City, Delaware
refinery are “routine,” Michael Karlovich, a Parsippany, New
Jersey-based spokesman, said in a telephone interview. The plant
had an upset early yesterday that forced operators to remove
feedstock from the coker, according a regulatory filing.  The same gasoline in  Chicago (CHCG87PC)  saw its discount widen 7 cents
to 41 cents a gallon. The fuel was at a discount of 15.5 cents a
gallon on Feb. 3. Midwest refiners have maintained production
using discounted crude from  North Dakota  and Canada.  Gasoline inventories in the Midwest rose to 56.4 million

March 5, 2010.  Regular gasoline in the  Midwest (GRP3G387) , or Group 3, weakened 0.5
cent to a discount of 14.25 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
