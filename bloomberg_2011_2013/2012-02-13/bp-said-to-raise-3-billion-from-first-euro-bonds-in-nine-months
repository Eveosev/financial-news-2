BP Plc, (BP/)  Europe’s second-largest oil
company, plans to raise 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion) from
its first bond sale in the currency in nine months, according to
a banker involved in the transaction.  BP will price its 1.25 billion euros of 2016 bonds to
yield 78 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, which
compares with the 72 basis-point spread on its existing notes
maturing in June of the same year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The London-based company is selling its 2019 notes at
103 basis points over swaps, compared with the spread of 101 on
its outstanding June 2020 bonds.  Sheila Williams , a spokeswoman for BP in  London , said the
sale’s proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes,
without being specific or commenting on the deal terms.  BP is returning to the euro bond market for the first time
since May 26, when it raised 1.5 billion euros, Bloomberg data
show. BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Lloyds Banking Group
Plc,  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and Societe Generale SA are managing the
new deal, said the banker involved, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private.  To contact the reporters on this story:
