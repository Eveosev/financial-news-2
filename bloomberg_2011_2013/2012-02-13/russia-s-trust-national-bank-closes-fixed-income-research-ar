Trust National Bank , a Russian
lender, said it’s closing its fixed-income research division as
the bank focuses on retail clients.  “The strategy of the bank involves strengthening its
market position in retail banking and hence, the proportion of
clients who need complex analytical products will decline,” the
bank said in an e-mailed statement. “A small portion” of the
research unit’s employees will leave the company, Trust National
said.  The seven-member team is led by Leonid Ignatiev, who
declined to comment when reached by phone. The analysts earlier
sent out an e-mail indicating clients were receiving their last
research.  Trust uses Hollywood actor  Bruce Willis  to front its
advertising campaign in  Russia . Merrill Lynch & Co. acquired a
10 percent stake in the bank in 2007 for an undisclosed amount.  To contact the reporters on this story:
