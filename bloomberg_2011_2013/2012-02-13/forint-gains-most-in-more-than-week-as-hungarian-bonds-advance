The forint appreciated the most in
more than a week against the euro and Hungarian bonds gained
after Greek lawmakers approved austerity plans to secure rescue
funds, boosting investor demand for riskier assets worldwide.  The currency of  Hungary , the European Union’s most-indebted
eastern member, appreciated 1.2 percent, the most since Feb. 1,
to 290.79 per euro by 4:02 p.m. in Budapest. Bonds rose, cutting
yields on government notes due November 2017 by 18 basis points,
or 0.18 percentage point, to 8.49 percent.  Global stocks and oil rose and the euro gained as passage
of the Greek austerity bill fueled optimism that euro-region
finance ministers will approve the second bailout on Feb. 15.  “The Greek austerity vote is the indisputable driver in
the market,” Gyorgy Cselenyi, a Budapest-based bond trader at
BNP Paribas SA, said by phone today. “I don’t expect much
further strengthening from these levels ahead of Wednesday’s
meeting of finance ministers. I believe the market has peaked
for now. The 290 level for the forint is a very strong
resistance.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
