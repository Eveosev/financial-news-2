The  European Central Bank  said it
bought fewer  government bonds  last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it settled 59 million euros
($78 million) of bond purchases in the week through Feb. 10,
down from 124 million euros the previous week. The ECB will take
seven-day term deposits tomorrow to absorb the 219.5 billion
euros of liquidity created since its Securities Markets Program
started in May 2010, a practice it employs to ensure the
purchases don’t fuel inflation.  Yields on government bonds have fallen since the ECB
injected 489 billion euros in three-year funds into the banking
system in December. Italian 10-year bonds advanced today for the
fifth time in six days and Portuguese yields reached an 11-week
low as  Greece ’s austerity package vote curbed the risk of
contagion to the region’s most-indebted nations. Euro-area
finance ministers plan to convene on Feb. 15 to decide on a
second Greek aid package.  To contact the reporter on this story:
