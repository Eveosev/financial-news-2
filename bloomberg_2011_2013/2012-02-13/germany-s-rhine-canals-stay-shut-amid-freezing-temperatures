Large sections of  Germany ’s canal
network linking to the Rhine River remain closed even as
temperatures have risen today, the Wasser- und
Schifffahrtsverwaltung, or WSV, said.  “The situation is unchanged from Friday,” Renate
Schaefer, an official at WSV, said by phone from Muenster. “It
is a little bit warmer and there is a mixture of snow and rain.
The water levels are not causing any problems.”  The Rhine-Herne canal from Duisburg to Dortmund and the
Elbe-Seiten waterway south of Hamburg are among the routes which
are shut.  Temperatures in  Frankfurt  have risen to minus 2 degrees
Celsius (28 Fahrenheit) after falling as low as minus 13 Celsius
(9 Fahrenheit) on Feb. 11, according to CustomWeather Inc. data
on Bloomberg.  The Rhine is  Europe ’s busiest inland waterway, used to ship
oil products, coal and grain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
