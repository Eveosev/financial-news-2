Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , the world’s
second-largest carrier by market value, said the global economic
slowdown may curb demand for flights to Europe and the U.S.  “I think there will be pressure, particularly for long-
haul operations,” Chief Executive Officer Goh Choon Phong told
reporters in Singapore today at an air show conference. Asia
travel is growing and business demand “is still quite strong
overall,” he said.  Qatar Airways Ltd. CEO Akbar Al Baker also today said he
expects a “strong recession” that will sap air-travel demand.
A debt crisis has slowed travel and trade in Europe, while
economic growth in the U.S. is “sluggish,” Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke said last week.  Goh said Singapore Airlines retains confidence in the
 Airbus (EAD)  SAS A380, even after cracks were discovered in wing parts
prompting safety checks. The Singapore-based carrier has
inspected and repaired 10 of its double-deck superjumbos and
returned them to service.  Airbus is helping to fix the cracks and it is “hopeful”
that it will be able to win more orders from Asian operators of
the planes, said Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders  separately.  “We will fix the wing problems as quickly as possible,”
he told reporters. “We screwed it up, we fix it at whatever it
costs.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
