(Corrects story published on Feb. 10 to say company
reported a group loss in first and second paragraphs.)  Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF) , the
country’s largest retail company, reported a second-quarter loss
as interest costs increased.  The  net loss  was 79.6 million rupees ($1.6 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a 124 million-rupee
profit a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said in a
statement to stock exchanges today. The median of nine analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was a profit of 442 million
rupees.  “Retail companies in India have had sluggish performance
because of the slowdown in the economy, restrained purchasing
power, and higher inflation and  interest rates ,” Paras Bothra,
head of research at Ashika Stock Broking Ltd. in Kolkata, said
before the announcement.  Pantaloon has been hurt by rising borrowing costs after the
 Reserve Bank  of India increased key interest rates by a record
amount from 2010 until October last year to fight inflation. The
nation’s economy is expected to grow at the slowest pace since
2009, prompting consumers to spend less.  The government on Feb. 7 predicted economic growth of 6.9
percent this year after Asia’s third-largest economy expanded
8.4 percent in 2010-2011.  Pantaloon’s shares fell 3.5 percent to 189.55 rupees in
Mumbai today. The earnings were announced after close of
markets. The retailer has gained 47 percent this year, compared
with a 15 percent advance in the  BSE India Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   Net sales grew 3.7 percent to 31.7 billion rupees. Interest
costs expanded 63 percent to 2.4 billion rupees, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
