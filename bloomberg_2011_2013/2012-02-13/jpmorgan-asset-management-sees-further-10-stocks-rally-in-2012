Stocks will post a further 10
percent rally in 2012, extending advances made so far this year,
as profits grow and the European debt crisis stabilises,
according to JPMorgan Asset Management.  The biggest gains will be in emerging-market equities where
earnings expansion will be larger, according to Dan Morris, a
global strategist at JPMorgan, which has $1.3 trillion in client
assets. The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of global shares rose 7.4 percent
this year through Feb. 10 as prospects for an improving U.S.
economy added more than $4.2 trillion to global equity prices.  “If  risk aversion  continues to fall as the situation in
Europe stabilises, equity prices should be driven less by swings
in sentiment and more by the outlook for company profits,”
Morris wrote in a report today.  “With earning-per-share gains of around 8 percent, a
dividend yield of nearly 3 percent, and the potential for better
valuations, we believe that equity markets may yet return
another 10 percent this year even after the rebound we have
already seen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
