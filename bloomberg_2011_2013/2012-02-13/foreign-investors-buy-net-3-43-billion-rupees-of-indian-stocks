Overseas  investors  bought a net  3.43
billion rupees  ($69 million) of Indian equities on Feb. 10,
raising total investments in equities this year to 202.5 billion
rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 26.7 billion rupees of shares and sold
23.2 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. They purchased a net 17.3 billion
rupees of bonds, taking total inflow into debt this year to
169.6 billion rupees, the data  show .  Offshore funds have invested 4.646 trillion rupees into
local stocks and 1.387 trillion rupees in bonds since they were
allowed into the country in 1993. Investments in debt increased
after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government raised the cap
on foreign ownership of local currency bonds by 20 percent to
$60 billion in November to stem a slide in the rupee. The
currency tumbled 16 percent in 2011,  Asia ’s worst performer.  India’s $1.3 trillion stock market, Asia’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Flows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among
the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led
the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , the
second worst annual loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
