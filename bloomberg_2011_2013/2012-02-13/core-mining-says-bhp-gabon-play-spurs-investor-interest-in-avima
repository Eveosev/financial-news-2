(Corrects Feb. 13 story to show project is in the Republic
of Congo.)  Core Mining Ltd.  said interest from
investors in its Avima deposit in the Republic of Congo
increased after reports  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  is seeking control of
a nearby project in Gabon.  “That’s triggered some strong interest,” said Socrates Vasiliades, chief executive officer, in an interview. “We’re
listening to proposals at the moment. If it helps fund us
through to production, then why not. Let’s talk. It’s a race.”  The closely held company, which is studying a $4.5 billion
iron-ore mine, port and rail project, counts OAO Severstal and
Glencore International Plc as investors and is seeking to start
output by 2015. BHP, the largest mining company, is in talks
with Gabon on control of the nation’s biggest iron ore deposit,
Belinga, two people familiar with the talks said last month.  Avima is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the proposed
Belinga site and may produce as much as 35 million metric tons
of the steel-making raw material a year, making it one of the
largest producing  iron ore  mines on the continent.  “Bringing in some expertise with an established player
would be very good for the company and its shareholders,”
Vasiliades said. Core said in November the deposit was estimated
to hold about 1 billion tons of iron ore. Severstal acquired a
16.5 percent stake in Core, the company said in May 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
