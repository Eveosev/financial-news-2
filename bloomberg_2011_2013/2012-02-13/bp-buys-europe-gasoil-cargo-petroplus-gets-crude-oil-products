European gasoil cargo premiums in
the Mediterranean advanced as BP Plc bought its second shipment
in two days. Jet fuel barge premiums fell in northwest  Europe .  Petroplus Holdings AG’s Coryton 220,000 barrel-a-day oil
refinery in the U.K. received a seventh crude tanker since the
company’s credit lines were frozen in December, allowing
operations to continue at reduced rates.  Light Products  Gasoline (MOGEEURB)  for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded at from $1,040 to $1,048 a metric ton, according
to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That’s the highest since Sept. 9 and compares with deals
from $1,033 to $1,043 at the end of last week.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Statoil ASA, Koch Industries Inc.
and Hess Corp.’s Hetco unit sold Eurobob grade, to which ethanol
is added to make finished motor fuel. Cargill Inc., Gunvor Group
Ltd. and BP were the buyers.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to Brent, rose to $7.30 a
barrel from $6.61 on Feb. 10, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and refined products broker in London.
That’s the most since Feb. 1.  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent was $4.51 a barrel, little
changed from the previous session, PVM data showed.  LyondellBasell Industries NV plans to shut a cracker at its
Wesseling site in  Germany  for maintenance. “We have one of our
big crackers down in the fall at Wesseling,” Chief Executive
Officer James Gallogly said on Feb. 10, according to a
transcript of a conference call.  The Wesseling complex has two crackers with a capacity to
produce 735,000 metric tons and 305,000 tons respectively of
ethylene a year.  Middle Distillates  Jet fuel, which trades at a differential to the gasoil
contract on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London , dropped
relative to that measure.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG sold on the barge market, where deals
were done from $53 to $54 more than March gasoil, according to a
similar survey monitoring the Platts pricing window. That
compares with Feb. 10 deals at $55.  BP bought a gasoil cargo of about 30,000 tons from Vitol
Group for delivery to Castellon in  Spain  at a premium of $16 to
March futures, according to the survey. This is $2 higher than
the company’s Feb. 10 trade for delivery to Elefsis in  Greece .  Barges of gasoil traded lower at premiums of $3 and $4 a
ton to March futures, the survey showed. North Sea Group BV sold
to BP and Shell. That compares with trades at $5 more than March
gasoil Feb. 10.  Vitol sold a 20,000 ton ultra-low-sulfur  diesel  cargo, to
be loaded on the Admiral, to Gunvor for delivery into  Le Havre 
at about $1 less than the French benchmark diesel price. The
company also sold a 30,000 ton cargo, the Seapike, into Lavera
to Total SA at about $3 below the Mediterranean benchmark.  BP bought barges of diesel for the ninth day, with trades
taking place from $14 to $16.50 a ton more than March gasoil on
ICE, the survey showed. Deals were carried out at premiums of
$16 and $17 on Feb. 10.  Gasoil for March dropped 0.4 percent, or $4.25, to $993.50
a ton at 5:32 p.m. London time on ICE. The April contract was
$7.25 lower than Feb. 10 at $989.50 a ton. March’s premium to
the next month fell to $4 a ton from $5.75.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability,
dropped to $15.44 a barrel from $16.32 on Feb. 10. Front-month
Brent increased 0.7 percent to $118 a barrel on ICE.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  was little changed, trading from
$688.50 to $689.50 a ton, the survey of Platts showed. That
compares with deals Feb. 10 of $687 to $692. The low-sulfur
grade traded three times at $721 a ton.  Refineries  Petroplus’s Coryton refinery received a seventh ship,
Katja, which had a draft, or sailing depth, of 8.5 meters today
compared with 12.7 meters when it was at the terminal on Feb.
10, signaling it unloaded its cargo, according to AISLive ship-
