The  European Central Bank  will
probably help plug a financing gap in the Greek bailout that
euro-area finance officials will consider this week,  ING Group (INGA) 
NV senior economist  Carsten Brzeski  said.  Even with the 130 billion-euro ($172 billion) aid package
and a debt writeoff with private creditors, Greece may need as
much as 15 billion euros to meet debt-reduction targets,
Brussels-based Brzeski said today by phone.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  rejected selling Greek bonds
held by the central bank to Europe’s temporary bailout fund at a
loss, saying it would violate the prohibition on monetary
financing of governments. Speaking hours before a meeting of
euro-area finance ministers Feb. 9. he declined further comment.  “I cannot say anything on how our holdings of Greek bonds
will be treated,” Draghi said. Talk of the ECB sharing losses
is “unfounded” and “it is not our intention to violate” the
prohibition on monetary state financing.  Given the options of additional taxpayer funding or an
intervention by the ECB, “the most likely one is that the ECB
will take part in foregoing the profits,” Brzeski said. The
extra funding will be needed to meet a goal to reduce Greek
public debt to 120 percent of economic output by 2020.  Euro-area finance ministers declined to ratify the 130
billion-euro Greek bailout package last week, saying  Greece  must
first put its verbal commitments into law. They’ll meet again in
Brussels in two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
