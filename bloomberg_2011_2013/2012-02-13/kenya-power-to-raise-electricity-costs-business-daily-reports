Kenya Power Ltd. will raise
electricity tariffs from this month after it increased use of
diesel-generated plants amid a decline in water levels at
hydropower dams, Business Daily reported.  Prices will rise to 5.60 shillings (7 cents) per kilowatt
hour from 5.44 shillings, the Nairobi-based newspaper said,
citing Energy Regulatory Commission Director-General Kaburu
Mwirichia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
