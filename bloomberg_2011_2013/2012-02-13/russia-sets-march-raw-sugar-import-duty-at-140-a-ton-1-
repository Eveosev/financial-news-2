Russia  will keep its tax on raw
sugar imports at $140 a metric ton in March, the Customs Union
Commission of Russia, Belarus and  Kazakhstan  said.  The average raw sugar price in New York was calculated at
24.05 cents a pound, or $530.17 a ton in January, the Customs
Union Commission, which oversees the tariffs for Russia, Belarus
and Kazakhstan, said on its website. The duty is based on
monthly sugar prices in New York, with a one-month lag. It will
stay at $140 a ton for May through July, the commission said
last week. A minimum rate of $140 a ton will be applied for
August through April if the monthly average price in  New York 
exceeds $396.84 a ton, according to the commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
