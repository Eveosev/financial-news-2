United Bank for Africa Plc , a
Nigerian lender with operations in 19 countries, fell to the
weakest level since October 2003 on a selloff,  Renaissance
Capital  said.  The stock retreated the maximum 5 percent to 1.72 naira by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. Trading volumes reached 278
percent of the three-month daily average, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “There was a huge sell out of the stock, which put it
under pressure,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based Sub-Saharan
Africa banking analyst at Renaissance Capital, said by phone
today. “This could be linked mainly to the profit warning
issued by the bank last week.”  The lender said Feb. 8 it expects to report a loss for the
2011 financial year due to write-offs from the sale of its bad
loans to the Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria , set up by the
government to bail out the banking industry from a 2009
financial crisis. The bank suspended a planned share sale the
following day, citing unfavourable market conditions.  Nigeria implemented banking reforms following a debt crisis
in 2008 and 2009 triggered by loans given to stock market
speculators. The central bank fired eight chief executives of
the country’s 24 banks and set up Amcon to buy the debts and
stabilize the banking industry. The central bank introduced a
December common year-end for lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
