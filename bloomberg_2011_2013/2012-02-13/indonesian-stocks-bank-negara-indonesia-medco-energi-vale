Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite index  rose 1.3 percent to 3,961.90,
the steepest increase since Feb. 2.  PT Astra International (ASII)  ,  Indonesia ’s largest
automotive retailer, advanced 3 percent to 73,350 rupiah, the
biggest gain since Dec. 16. The stock’s 9.6 percent drop last
week was seen as excessive, according to Leonardo Henry Gavaza,
an analyst at PT Bahana Securities.  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI)  , the nation’s third-
biggest state-owned bank by assets, rose 2.9 percent to 3,550
rupiah. The company expects profit to rise 25 percent and
lending to grow by 18 percent to 22 percent this year,  Bisnis
Indonesia  reported, citing Finance Director Yap Tjay Soen.
Corporate Secretary Tribuana Tunggadewi didn’t return a call to
her mobile phone.  PT Bumi Resources (BUMI)  , Indonesia’s largest coal
producer, gained 3.1 percent to 2,475 rupiah. Bumi Plc’s
shareholder Bakrie Group may reconsider a bid to replace the
coal producer’s management, including billionaire  Nathaniel
Rothschild , should its independent directors offer a solution
that “makes sense,” Chris Fong, a spokesman to the group,
said. Bumi owns 29 percent of Bumi Resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
