Jive Software (JIVE)   Inc. (JIVE) , a maker of
social-networking software for businesses, reached the highest
since its initial public offering after a Barron’s story over
the weekend highlighted its similarities to Facebook Inc.  Jive  rose  8.6 percent to $18.54 at the close in New York.
The  Palo Alto , California-based company  debuted  Dec. 13 at $12 a
share and has advanced 55 percent since then.  The company is tapping corporate demand for Facebook-style
tools that help employees communicate internally and with
customers. Jive, which added  customers  DirecTV and Allianz in
the fourth quarter, bolstered spending on sales and marketing by
61 percent during the period.  “This is a company with many tie-ins to Facebook and
social media,” said Cindy Profaca, a managing director with
IPOfinancial.com in Millburn,  New Jersey . Jive has “been around
since 2001, so they’ve navigated some pretty rough waters in the
sector,” said Profaca, who recommends buying the shares.  The Barron’s story  said  Jive is sometimes known as the
“other” social networking company.  The company on Feb. 7 posted its first earnings report
since its IPO. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 53
percent to $22.5 million compared with a year earlier. Analysts
had  estimated  $21 million.  Jive  reported  a wider loss of 28 cents on an adjusted
basis, compared with 25 cents a year earlier. Analysts had
predicted a loss of 39 cents. Jive forecast first-quarter
revenue of as much as $24.5 million. Analysts had predicted
$22.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
