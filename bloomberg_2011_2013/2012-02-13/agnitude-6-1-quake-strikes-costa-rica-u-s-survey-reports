A 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck 46
miles (75 kilometers) south of  San Jose ,  Costa Rica  at 4:55 a.m.
local time today, the U.S. Geological Survey  said  in a statement
on its website. The quake was 17 miles deep, it reported.  There have been no reports of injuries or damage so far,
San Jose-based newspaper La Nacion  reported  on its website,
citing authorities in the coastal province of Puntarenas that it
didn’t identify.  Juan Manuel Salazar, an employee at La Mansion hotel in
Quepos, said that the earthquake shook the building for about 20
seconds, though there was no damage.  Authorities haven’t issued a tsunami warning, Johnny Nunez,
a spokesman for the Central American country’s seismological
observatory, known as Ovsicori, said by telephone.  The Geological Survey earlier estimated the earthquake’s
magnitude at 6.1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
