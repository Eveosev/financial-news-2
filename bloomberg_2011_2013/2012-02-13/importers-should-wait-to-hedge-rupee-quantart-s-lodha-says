Samir Lodha, managing director at
QuantArt Market Solutions Ltd. in Mumbai, says importers should
delay or reduce hedging against the dollar at current levels as
the rupee will probably continue to strengthen. He commented in
an e-mail today.  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 49.3063 per dollar as of
12:41 p.m. in Mumbai, taking this year’s gain to 7.6 percent.  “The  Reserve Bank  of  India  apparently intervened on Feb.
10 and sold dollars at around the 49.75 level. It seems the RBI
is determined to not allow the rupee to weaken much since a
depreciated rupee adversely affects critical non-food inflation.  “Importers and foreign investors in India can decrease the
amount of currency they have hedged and wait for around 48.50 or
48 per dollar to hedge import payments. At the same time they
should monitor the RBI’s actions. If the RBI does not protect 50
then importers should hedge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
