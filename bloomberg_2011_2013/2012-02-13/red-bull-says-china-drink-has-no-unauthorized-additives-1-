Red Bull  GmbH said its drinks don’t
contain additives that are barred by the Chinese government
after  Carrefour SA (CA)  removed all the Austrian energy-drink maker’s
beverages from the company’s store-shelves in China.  The National Food Quality Supervision and Inspection
Center’s checks on Red Bull samples showed the products met the
national standards and didn’t contain unauthorized additives,
according to a Sina report posted on the agency’s  website . Red
Bull also posted the agency’s statement on its  website .  The Chinese government has stepped up efforts to crack down
on food safety violations since six babies died and 300,000
others were sickened by formula milk tainted with melamine in
2008, in the nation’s worst food-related incident. Vice Premier
 Li Keqiang  last week called for harsh punishments against food-
safety violations and said  China  plans to establish a long-term
mechanism to check food safety in 2012.  Carrefour took all Red Bull drinks off its shelves
nationwide pending government test results, said a Beijing-based
official at Carrefour, who asked not to be identified citing
company policy. The French supermarket chain hasn’t decided when
it will resume sale of the product, according to the official.  Four calls to Red Bull’s office in Beijing weren’t
answered.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
