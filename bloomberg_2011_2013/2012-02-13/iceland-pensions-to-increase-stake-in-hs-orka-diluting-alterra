Alterra Power Corp. (AXY) , a renewable
energy developer, said a group of Icelandic pension funds will
increase their stake in the geothermal energy company HS Orka hf
to 33.4 percent from 25 percent.  The pension funds, Jarovarmi, will pay 4.7 billion kronur
($38.3 million) for 878 million treasury shares, Vancouver-based
Alterra said today in a statement. The deal will reduce
Alterraâ€™s holding in HS Orka to 66.6 percent from 75 percent,
according to the statement.  HS Orka will use the funds from the sale to finance the
equity component of an 80-megawatt expansion of its 100-megawatt
Reykjanes geothermal power plant. The pension funds had the
option to increase their stake in HS Orka after their initial
8.06 billion kronur investment in April.  MP Bank advised Alterra on the transaction, which is
expected to close by the end of February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
