Analysts covering  Brazil  lowered
their 2013 interest-rate forecast for the first time in two
months.  Brazil’s 2013 year-end benchmark rate will be 10.5 percent,
according to the median forecast in a Feb. 10 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published today, compared with an
estimate of 10.75 percent the previous week. Growth next year
will be 4.1 percent, the economists said, down from an estimate
of 4.2 percent the week before.  Policy makers will increase the Selic next year to keep
inflation under control after reducing it to 9.5 percent this
year, the survey shows. Economists expect inflation to be 5.29
percent this year and 5 percent next year, above the midpoint of
the central bank’s target range. Brazil targets inflation of 4.5
percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  There is a “high” chance that policy makers will cut the
benchmark rate until it is below 10 percent, the bank said in
the minutes to its Jan. 17-18 policy meeting. Since August, the
bank has reduced the rate by 200 basis points to 10.50 percent
to protect Brazil’s economy from the European debt crisis.  Global financial markets fell late last week over
uncertainty whether  Greece  would adopt austerity measures
required for fresh international aid. Lawmakers in  Athens 
approved the necessary legislation in the early morning hours of
today.  Growth Forecast  Brazilian inflation will converge this year toward the
target of 4.5 percent, the central bank’s director of economic
policy, Carlos Hamilton, said on Feb. 10. Annual inflation
slowed to 6.22 percent in January.  Analysts held their estimate for growth in  Latin America ’s
biggest economy this year at 3.3 percent. Growth slowed to about
3 percent last year from around 7.5 percent in 2010, Central
bank President Alexandre Tombini said on Feb. 2.  Statistics in the last month showed the economy rebounding,
after it contracted in the third quarter for the first time in
more than two years.  Brazil’s economic activity index, a proxy for gross
domestic product, expanded at its fastest pace in 19 months in
November, reversing a three-month contraction, while
unemployment fell to a record low of 4.7 percent in December and
industrial production rose at the quickest pace in seven months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
