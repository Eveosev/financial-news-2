Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) , Latin
America’s second-largest beef producer, concluded the sale of
its U.S. and European distribution unit for $400 million.  The unit, a distribution center for  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  in the
U.S., Europe, Asia and Oceania, was sold to Rosemont, Illinois-
based Martin-Brower Co., Sao Paulo-based Marfrig said in a
statement today.  The deal, announced on Sept. 18, was initially expected to
be concluded by December. Proceeds will be used to reduce debt
and reinforce the company’s cash position, Chief Executive
Officer Marcos Molina said Sept. 19.  Marfrig is divesting assets as it seeks to cut debt to less
than three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, or Ebitda. The company’s debt-to-Ebitda ratio
almost doubled to 4 times in the third quarter from 2.4 a year
earlier, Molina said Dec. 12.  The company also agreed on Dec. 21 to sell some logistics
assets in Brazil to  JSL SA (JSLG3)  for 150 million reais ($87.5
million).  Martin-Brower will complete its payments to Marfrig on
March 30, the Brazilian company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
