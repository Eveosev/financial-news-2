Cellular life on Earth probably
originated in ponds, not the ocean, scientists said, challenging
previous assertions.  Inland volcanic pools are richer than deep-sea ones in
zinc, manganese, phosphorous and other compounds Earth’s first
cells needed, according to a study by scientists at  Germany ’s
University of Osnabruck in the  Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences .  Earlier studies have suggested that marine fissures warmed
by volcanic activity were the most suitable cradles of life.
Inland pools were probably better suited to cellular growth
because they received sunlight, a source of energy, the authors
said in the article published today.  “These terrestrial fields appear to provide the best
environment on the primordial Earth for the origin of
protocells,” they wrote.  The early cells likely assembled in volcanic ponds that
acted like hatcheries, venting vapor from the planet’s interior,
according to  Armen Mulkidjanian  and colleagues. The chemical
composition of these emissions most closely matches the
chemistry of the cells, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
