Washington  became the seventh U.S.
state to legalize same-sex marriage under a bill signed by
Governor Christine Gregoire, setting it up for a challenge at
the ballot box in November.  The state House of Representatives approved the legislation
Feb. 8 over the opposition of Republicans who said the practice
would erode traditional marriage and harm families and children.  Washington joins  New York ,  Massachusetts ,  Connecticut ,
 Iowa ,  New Hampshire ,  Vermont  and the  District of Columbia  with
same-sex weddings laws on the books. Scheduled to take effect in
June, implementation of the Washington law would be delayed if
opponents gather enough signatures to put a referendum to repeal
the law on the November ballot, according to Gregoireâ€™s
spokeswoman, Karina Shagren.  To contact the reporter on this story:
