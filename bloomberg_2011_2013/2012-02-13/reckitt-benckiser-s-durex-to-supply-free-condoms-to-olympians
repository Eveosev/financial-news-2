Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc’s (RB/)  Durex
brand will provide free condoms along with information about
safe sex to athletes at this year’s London Olympics.  Durex will be available at three accommodation centers --
the main village in Stratford, the sailing center on England’s
south coast, and the rowing area west of London, Fran Edwards, a
spokeswoman for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic
and  Paralympic Games , said in an interview. She declined to say
how many condoms would be provided. Stratford will house 23,000
athletes and officials, according to the  London 2012 website.   “It makes perfect sense to ensure young Olympians are
fully prepared for all aspects of their athletic activities,”
Michelle Strutton, an analyst at market researcher Mintel
International in London, said by e-mail.  Durex, the world’s top-selling brand in its field, supplied
130,000 condoms to athletes at the 2004 Olympics in  Athens ,
according to brand spokeswoman Vanessa Munnings.  China  gave away
80,000 condoms during the 2008 Beijing games, the official
Xinhua News Agency has reported. At the 2000 Sydney games,
supplies ran low and an additional 20,000 were ordered.  U.K. bookmaker Ladbrokes Plc offers  odds of 7-2  against the
London Olympic Village running out of condoms, meaning a winning
2-pound ($3.16) bet would return 7 pounds plus the stake.  “I suspect it won’t be material in terms of sales, but the
kudos would be positive,”  Martin Deboo , an analyst at Investec
Securities in London, said of the Olympics supply agreement.  Reckitt Benckiser, which acquired Durex maker SSL
International in 2010 for 2.5 billion pounds, isn’t an official
sponsor of the  London  games, which start July 27. SSL emerged
from a series of mergers and its roots date back to 1915, when
the London Rubber Company started selling imported condoms.  Reckitt Benckiser fell 0.5 percent to 3,525 pence at 11:42
a.m. in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
