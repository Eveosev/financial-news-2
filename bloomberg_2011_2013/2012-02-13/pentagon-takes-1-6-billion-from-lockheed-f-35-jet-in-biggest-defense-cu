The Pentagon’s proposed $525 billion
budget for fiscal year 2013 would seek the most savings on
weapons by reducing purchases of  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35
Joint Strike Fighter, the military’s costliest program.  The Defense Department would cut $1.6 billion from the F-35
program by eliminating 13 planned aircraft, part of $18 billion
in weapons cuts proposed in the budget that President  Barack Obama  sent to Congress today for the year beginning Oct. 1.  The proposed spending plan of $525.4 billion is $45 billion
less than projected a year ago and the first installment in an
8.5 percent reduction by 2021. With $88.5 billion in war
spending added in, the Pentagon total would come to $613.9
billion, down $31.8 billion from the amount enacted by Congress
for this year.  Representative Howard “Buck” McKeon of  California , the
Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
criticized Obama’s budget proposal.  Obama’s priorities will reduce “resources for our
struggling armed forces and redirect them to exploding domestic
bureaucracies,” McKeon said in a statement. “This budget
reflects a true reduction, in real terms, of military spending
while we have troops in combat.”  The budget request marks the third consecutive year of
slower growth in military spending since former Defense
Secretary  Robert Gates  told Congress in January 2009 that “the
spigot of defense spending that opened on 9/11 is closing.”  Cuts by Categories  The Pentagon is proposing to cut $259 billion through 2017
from previous plans through reductions of $94 billion in weapons
procurement, $69 billion in military personnel, $60 billion in
operations and maintenance, $19 billion in military construction
and $17 billion in research and development.  The budget proposal provides $9.17 billion for 29 F-35
aircraft, two fewer than this year. The Pentagon also proposed
delaying the purchase of 179 F-35s beyond 2017 for a total of
$15.1 billion in savings.  The cut in funding for the F-35 built by Bethesda,
Maryland-based Lockheed results from “changing priorities,
funding constraints and the need to reduce” the overlap between
the program’s development and initial production, the Pentagon
said in its budget documents.  McKeon criticized the Pentagon for planning to reduce
military compensation and for failing to plan for so-called
sequester, automatic defense cuts of as much as $500 billion
that are scheduled to start taking effect in January 2013.  Panetta Before Congress  Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  will be questioned about the
budget by lawmakers, starting with a scheduled appearance
tomorrow before the Senate Armed Services Committee.  Panetta presented the strategic backdrop for the budget on
Jan. 26, outlining a strategy that places increased emphasis on
the Asia-Pacific region while retaining a Middle East focus. The
Pentagon promised in budget documents today “a force that is
smaller and leaner, but also agile, ready, flexible and
technologically advanced.”  More resources will go to special operations such as the
commando unit that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden last
year.  Electronic Warfare  To deliver on the strategy, today’s budget proposal would
provide $1.8 billion for unspecified upgrades to tactical
sensors and electronic warfare systems, $600 million in fiscal
2014 for a new floating command base and $300 million for a new
bomber.  In addition to the F-35, the Pentagon seeks savings in
fiscal 2013 of: $1.3 billion from delays in the Army’s new
Ground Combat Vehicles program; $800 million from truncating
purchases of  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) ’s Global Hawk drones; and
$600 million from delaying by two years starting development on
a new ballistic missile submarine, the SSBN(X).  An additional $400 million would be saved from reduced
purchases of the V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft built by
 Boeing Co. (BA)  and the Bell Helicopter unit of  Textron Inc., (TEXTRON)  while
$200 million more would be saved by canceling a program to
upgrade the Army’s all-terrain Humvees.  Winners, Losers  Boeing and  Raytheon Co. (RTN)  may be among the winners in the
Pentagon’s proposed budget, Roman Schweizer, a Washington-based
defense policy analyst at the investment firm Guggenheim
Partners, said in a note to clients.  “Boeing’s franchise aircraft programs appear to be in
great shape,” Schweizer wrote. Proposed funding for the
company’s Air Force tankers, AH-64 Apache helicopters and P8-A
Poseidon surveillance planes are all “up substantially,”
compared with this year, he said. Funding for Raytheon’s
missiles, including the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air
Missile, AIM-9X and Joint Standoff Weapon, “are either about
even or up significantly,” Schweizer said.  Oshkosh Corp. (OSK) ,  General Dynamics Corp. (GD)  and  United
Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Sikorsky unit may be losers, with funding
for their programs declining “significantly,” while Lockheed
and Textron may emerge as neither winners nor losers, according
to Schweizer.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Aerospace & Defense Index  rose
less than 1 percent at the close in New York trading. The
biggest gainers were Textron,  United Technologies  and Raytheon.  Textron gained 4 percent to $28.04. Oshkosh, whose medium-
duty trucks for the Army would be cut back under the budget
plan, fell 5 percent to $23.68. Lockheed Martin rose 72 cents to
$88.23.  Base Closings  The Pentagon also is requesting congressional authority to
begin two additional rounds of domestic base closings in 2013
and 2015, a politically sensitive proposal in an election year,
as troops are reduced almost to the levels before the  Iraq war .  The budget documents include for the first time this year
numerous examples of spending reductions and increases planned
for 2013 through 2017, useful information for defense
contractors making long-range plans.  The Navy intends to spend $17.7 billion in fiscal 2013 on
Navy and Military Sealift Command shipbuilding and $83.7 billion
through 2017. The programs benefit Huntington Ingalls Industries
Inc., General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and  Austal Ltd. (ASB)   Missile defense spending is projected at $9.7 billion in
2013 and $47.4 billion through 2017.  The Pentagon intends to spend $25.1 billion through 2017
for “strategic deterrence,” including improvements for the B61
nuclear bomb, D5 Trident missiles and Minuteman III missile
arsenal.  Air Force, Navy  The Air Force plans to request $6.3 billion for a new
bomber through 2017. The Army wants to spend $5.7 billion
through 2017 on buying new Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters or
improving current ones.  The Navy plans to buy 10 fewer of Chicago-based Boeing’s P-
8 Poseidon maritime reconnaissance aircraft, saving $5.2 billion
through 2017.  Cancellation of the Defense Weather Satellite System by
Northrop Grumman, based in  Falls Church ,  Virginia , would save
$2.3 billion through 2017, and truncating the Block 30 version
of Northrop’s Global Hawk drone saves $2.5 billion over five
years.  Lockheed Martin’s Thaad missile interceptor program would
be trimmed by 150 weapons through 2017, for $1.8 billion in
savings.  Canceling eight Austal Joint High Speed Vessels would save
$1.5 billion through 2017, including $200 million in 2013.  Pace of Reductions  The fiscal 2013 budget proposal is 2.3 percent less,
adjusted for inflation, than this year’s budget. The Pentagon
projects a 1.6 percent reduction in inflation-adjusted spending
power from 2013 to 2017.  By contrast, the base defense budget grew from 2002 to 2009
at an average inflation-adjusted rate of 4 percent annually.  Base budget reductions would deepen from $45 billion next
year to $53 billion in fiscal 2014 and $54 billion by 2017,
according to administration figures outlining the first five
years of the Pentagon’s proposed deficit-reduction plan.  To save $29.4 billion through 2017, the Pentagon also is
proposing to provide smaller pay raises starting in 2015 and to
increase enrollment fees and deductibles for new entrants into
the military’s TRICARE For Life program. The health-insurance
system costs are requiring the services to set aside as much as
$11 billion annually.  The budget doesn’t propose revamping the military
retirement system to save money, instead recommending that
Congress set up a Retirement Modernization Commission.  The cumulative personnel changes would save $11 billion in
fiscal 2013, the Pentagon said.  Personnel Cuts  The Defense Department proposes reducing military personnel
by 31,300, or 1.4 percent, from this year. Including cuts this
year, military personnel, including Reserve and National Guard
units, would be reduced by about 124,000 through 2017.  Personnel levels would drop to 2,238,400 from 2,269,700
this year. The total would be 2,145,800 by 2017.  Army forces will be reduced by less than 1 percent to
1,115,300 in 2013 and drop to 1,048,200 in 2017. The Navy would
have 1.7 percent fewer personnel, for 385,200 in 2013, and face
a reduction of 3.9 percent to 376,600 people by 2017.  The Marines will be down to 236,900 in 2013, or 2 percent
less than this year. By 2017, the Marines face a reduction of
8.3 percent to 221,700.  The  Air Force  will have a total of 501,000 personnel in
2013, or 1.9 percent fewer people than this year. In 2017, the
Air Force’s personnel will decline to 499,300.  High Priorities  The Pentagon lists as “high-priority initiatives”
investments in special operations forces, unmanned systems,
cyber defense, ballistic missile defense, satellites and
Boeing’s KC-46A tanker, which sees a funding increase to $1.82
billion next year from $877 million this year.  The budget calls for spending $8 billion on the purchase
and launch of Lockheed Martin and Boeing satellites, 22 percent
less than this year. Still, the military is planning $40.1
billion through 2017 for space purchases.  The budget requests $3.4 billion for cyber security in
fiscal 2013 and $18 billion through 2017.  The General Dynamics WIN-T program is highlighted as the
Army’s “cornerstone tactical communications systems,”
receiving $1.2 billion in fiscal 2013 and $6.1 billion through
2017.  The proposed base budget for weapons spending is $98.8
billion in fiscal 2013, or about $18 billion less than projected
previously; $104.3 billion in fiscal 2014, or $21.6 billion
less; $112.3 billion in fiscal 2015, or $17.2 billion less;
$116.3 billion in 2016, or $20.9 billion less; and $122.9
billion in 2017 or $16.8 billion less.  To contact the reporters on this story:
