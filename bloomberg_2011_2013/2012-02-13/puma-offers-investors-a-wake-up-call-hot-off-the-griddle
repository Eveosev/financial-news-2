Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. Sports apparel-maker Puma issued an " environmental profit and loss statement ," last week, which it describes as "The first ever attempt to measure, value and report the environmental externalities caused by a major corporation and its entire supply chain." The bottom line: if Puma treated the environment like a business service provider, the company would owe the Earth 8 million euros ($10.6 million) for its core operations last year and another 137 million euros for the impact of its suppliers. Executive Chairman Jochen Zeitz described it as a "wake-up call" for Puma, and for all companies. The question is: will investors and other companies hear it?
