Costa Rica’s local-currency debt
rating was lowered by  Standard & Poor’s , which cited the
country’s “limited monetary flexibility” and rising government
spending.  S&P cut Costa Rica’s local-currency credit rating to BB, or
two levels below investment grade, from BB+. S&P affirmed Costa
Rica’s foreign-currency credit ratings at BB, on par with
Guatemala and  Turkey .  The ratings “balance the country’s limited monetary
flexibility as well as rising fiscal pressures with good
economic prospects, stable political system and relatively high
level of social development,” S&P said in a statement.  Costa Rica’s monetary policy lacks flexibility because of
the “high level” of dollarization in the economy, S&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
