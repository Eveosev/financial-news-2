Saudi Arabia ’s authorities arrested
blogger Hamza Kashghari at Riyadh’s international airport for
criticizing Islam after being deported from  Malaysia ,  Arab News 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Kashghari, a Saudi, will face blasphemy charges for posting
comments on his Twitter Inc. page considered offensive to Islam,
the Jeddah-based newspaper said today.  King Abdullah  issued
orders to arrest Kashghari and bring him to justice, it
reported.  Saudi Arabia maintains a strict interpretation of Sunni
Islam. It enforces gender restrictions and beheads convicted
murderers, while religious police patrol shopping centers
enforcing Islamic law.  Anyone who mocks God, his prophet or the religion should be
tried on charges of apostasy, the newspaper said, citing
statement from the Permanent Committee of Scholarly Research and
Islamic Edicts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
