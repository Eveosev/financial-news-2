China  told its television
broadcasters to limit the number of imported series they show,
the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television said in a
 circular  posted on its website.  The new rules bar all foreign TV series from the prime-time
hours of 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and restricts overseas-made shows to
no more than 25 percent of total programming time each day, the
regulator said yesterday. No import can exceed 50 episodes,
according to the agency.  President  Hu Jintao  wrote in an article published on Jan. 1
in the Communist Party’s Qiushi magazine that the West is using
cultural means to divide China and that the country needs to be
alert to this threat. Greater development of China’s media and
cultural industries was set as a national target in the
government’s 12th five-year  plan  that covers the period from
2011 through 2015.  “We’ve been pushing forward the development of the
domestic industry,” said Ma Runsheng, general manager of China
International Television Corp.’s Program Exchange Center. “It’s
only natural that some rules are published to ensure that
goal.”  High-definition shows should be given preference for import
to improve the quality of TV programming, SARFT said. Trailers
introducing foreign series must be limited to less than three
minutes, according to the regulator.  The agency also urged provincial television regulatory
agencies to strengthen efforts to crack down on violators of
this policy.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
