Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained,
pushing their yield to the lowest level since April, on
speculation commercial banks will boost holdings of government
debt as a cash crunch eases. The dong strengthened.  “As the banking system’s liquidity continued to see an
improvement and the government has requested the central bank to
have specific measures to reduce interest rates, we expect
yields on short and mid-terms bonds to keep declining in coming
days,” ACB Securities Inc. analysts including Cao Tan Phat, who
is based in  Ho Chi Minh City , wrote in a report obtained today.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung instructed the  State Bank  of
Vietnam to “solve” liquidity problems in the banking system in
the first quarter, the government said in a statement on its
website late last week. Dung also asked the central bank to
closely monitor the market with a view to reducing lending
 interest rates  at a “suitable” time.  Yields (GGVN3YR)  on five-year debt fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 12.34 percent as of 3:05 p.m. in Hanoi,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong rose 0.1 percent to 20,853 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the
 reference rate  at 20,828, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
