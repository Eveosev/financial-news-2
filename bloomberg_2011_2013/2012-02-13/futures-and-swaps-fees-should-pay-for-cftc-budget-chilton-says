U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  member Bart Chilton said supporters of user fees to
fund the agency’s oversight of swaps and futures markets should
offer suggestions for how they could be imposed.  President  Barack Obama ’s budget request for the main U.S.
derivatives regulator would provide $308 million for the 2013
fiscal year, 50 percent more than was approved for the current
12-month period. The proposal released today backed user fees as
a way to boost revenue without saying how they would be set.  “Those of us who support user fees have an obligation to
suggest how such a funding mechanism might work,” Chilton, one
of three Democrats on the five-member commission, said in an e-
mail. “The fear of the unknown with regard to fees has, in my
opinion, retarded serious movement forward.”  Fees should be imposed on swaps and futures and shouldn’t
be tied to the number of transactions, Chilton said.  “In the swaps space there are many fewer transactions, but
at larger volumes than occur” on regulated exchanges, he said.
“Some type of formula must be developed to accommodate this
difference, to fairly apportion fees across both markets.”  The  CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest futures exchange,
has opposed user fees, which were initially proposed by the
Obama administration in last year’s budget proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
