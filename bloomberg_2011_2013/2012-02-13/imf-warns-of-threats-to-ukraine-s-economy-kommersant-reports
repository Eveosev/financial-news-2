The  International Monetary Fund 
warned Ukrainian authorities of threats to the country’s economy
and financial stability,  Kommersant-Ukraine  reported, citing a
Jan. 31 letter from Max Alier, the IMF’s Ukraine representative,
to First Deputy Prime Minister Andriy Klyuev.  Ukraine needs to take “ambitious” steps in economic
policy, the newspaper cited Alier as saying. Pressure has grown
in recent months and low trust in authorities has halted capital
and investment inflows, according to the newspaper.  Ukraine needs to raise natural gas prices for households by
30 percent and those for  utility companies  by 58 percent,
followed by 20 percent increases every six months until domestic
tariffs meet the cost of gas imports, Alier said, according to
Kommersant-Ukraine.  The IMF wants Ukraine to liberalize the  currency market  and
to consolidate its state budget, to avoid severe financial and
economic stress, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
