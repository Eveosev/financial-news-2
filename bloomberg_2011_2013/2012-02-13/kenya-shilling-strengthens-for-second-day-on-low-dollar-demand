Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day on “low” dollar demand by businesses.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.7 percent to 82.40 per dollar and was trading 0.3
percent higher at 82.75 as of 11:39 a.m. in Nairobi.  “The shilling is stronger due to low dollar demand in the
market by businesses and following the recent mop-up by the
central bank,” Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi-based
NIC Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  The central bank removed 10 billion shillings ($120
million) from the market last week through  repurchase
agreements , it said in a weekly statement on Feb 10.  Tanzania’s shilling also appreciated for a second day,
trading 0.1 percent stronger at 1,590 per dollar, headed for the
highest close since Jan 20.  The Ugandan shilling gained for a second day, reaching the
highest in a year as businesses prepared to pay monthly taxes,
damping demand for dollars. The currency of the third-biggest
economy in  East Africa  appreciated as much as 0.2 percent to
2,306.50 per dollar at 12:50 p.m. A close at this level will be
the highest since Feb. 3, 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The shilling is stronger today because customers are out
of the market pending settlement of mid-month value-added tax,
which has to be settled in local currency,” Benon Okwenje, a
currency trader at Stanbic Bank Uganda Ltd., said by phone from
Kampala.  -- With assistance from Fred Ojambo in Kampala. Editors: Peter
