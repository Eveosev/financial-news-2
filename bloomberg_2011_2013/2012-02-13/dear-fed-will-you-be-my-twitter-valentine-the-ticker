It's been a tough few years for the  Federal Reserve , what with the economic crisis, persistently high unemployment, and naysayers doubting the central bank's every move. But not everyone has joined  Ron Paul 's crusade against the Fed. An innocuous tweet by economist Justin Wolfers has sparked a Fed love-in, with economists, journalists, bloggers and others weighing in using the hashtag  #fedvalentines . Here is a selection of some of the more memorable (or geeky) ways economists -- many at the Fed itself -- told the central bank "I love you" in 140 characters or less: @Justinwolfers: You're my long-run target; my nominal anchor. #FedValentines @Justinwolfers: You're my gold standard.  FedValentines @ Austan_Goolsbee FedValentines  Bernanke's fr/SCarolina&deals w/lots of big whiners. His line is so sane: Coreinfl is tame &a heck of a lot lowr than China's @SFFedReserve: My love is elastic, my commitment too big to fail  fedvalentines @SFFedReserve: I'm going to extraordinary measures to increase your stimulus  fedvalentines @PhiladelphiaFed: My love: you increase my interest & never diminish my returns.  FedValentines @PhiladelphiaFed: Her deviations are never standard, her probabilities never mean.  FedValentines @richfedresearch :Your equation is deriving me crazy  fedvalentines @AtlantaFed: Being with you hikes my pulse by several basis points  fedvalentines @MinneapolisFed: Shall I compare thee to  price stability  and full employment?  FedValentines @NYFedResearch: I'll be faithful to you at least until late 2014 (with dissent).  fedvalentines @MarkThomaThe non-traditional stimulus was way better than I thought it would be.  FedValentines ChicagoFed : Roses are red, these tweets are great, would you like to learn about our dual mandate? (Deborah Solomon is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.)
