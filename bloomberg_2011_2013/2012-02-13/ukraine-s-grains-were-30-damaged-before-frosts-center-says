Damage rates for Ukrainian winter
grains reached 30 percent even before temperatures fell in the
past few weeks, according to the nation’s weather center.  As much as 30 percent of winter wheat and half of winter
rapeseed failed to grow before frosts set in, Tetiana Adamenko,
head of the center’s agro-meteorology department, said by phone.
She cited results of tests on soil samples taken on Jan. 25 in
all of Ukraine’s regions. Winter barley all died in autumn,
according to Adamenko.  Temperatures fell as low as minus 35 degrees Celsius (minus
31 degrees Fahrenheit) last month, damaging winter grains in
fields with less than 5 centimeters (2 inches) of snow pack.
Farmers will need to replant half of the country’s winter
grains, or 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres) of
reseeding, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said last week.  Soil temperatures in some snow-free areas in southern and
southeastern Ukraine touched the lowest levels in at least 25
years, Adamenko said today. That means a further 20 percent of
winter grain areas will be lost, she said.  Fields in the Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk and Kherson regions
will sustain damage from the abnormally low soil temperatures,
Adamenko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
