Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to a one-month high, on
speculation the central bank will raise  interest rates  further.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
7.43 percent at 10:19 a.m. Bogota time, according to the central
bank. That’s the highest level on a closing basis since Jan. 11.
The bond’s price fell 0.271 centavo to 120.32 centavos per peso.  In minutes published after markets closed Feb. 10,
Colombia’s central bank cited the economy’s strongest growth
since 2006 and a surge in lending in its decision to
unexpectedly raise in January the overnight lending rate 25
basis points to 5 percent. The increase is the eighth since the
beginning of 2011 as central bankers seek to rein in inflation
expectations and cool growth that they estimate as high as 6
percent this year.  “The minutes reaffirm the view that it’s unlikely the
central bank will halt its rate increase cycle,” said  Camilo Perez , the head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the country’s
second-biggest bank. “Assuming things abroad don’t
deteriorate” Banco de la Republica may raise the key rate to as
high as 5.75 percent this year, he said.  The peso advanced 0.3 percent to 1,779.30 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,784.15 on Feb. 10. The peso has jumped 8.9 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
