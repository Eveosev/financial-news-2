Russia  needs to spend 350 billion
rubles ($11.7 billion) on pipelines for oil product delivery to
match production increases and avoid a deficit in the domestic
market,  Vedomosti  reported, citing the Energy Ministry.  OAO Transneft (TRNFP) , the state-run pipeline monopoly, may lack
the necessary funds for the pipelines, the Moscow newspaper
said, citing a letter from Deputy Energy Minister Sergei
Kudryashov to Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin .  Transneft spokesman Igor Dyomin declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News via mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
