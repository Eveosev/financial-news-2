Qatar Petroleum  and Qatar
Petrochemical Co. signed an agreement to build a petrochemical
complex in the country’s industrial city of Ras Laffan, the
second such plant to be announced in the past two years.  The facility will cost $5.5 billion and be completed by
2018, Qatar’s Energy Minister Mohammed Al-Sada said at the
signing ceremony in the Qatari capital Doha. State-run Qatar
Petroleum will control an 80 percent stake in the plant and
Qatar Petrochemical, a unit of Industries Qatar, will control 20
percent, according to a release handed out at the signing.  The plant will produce 1.4 million metric tons of ethylene,
850,000 tons of high-density polyethylene, 430,000 tons of
linear-low-density polyethylene and 760,000 tons of
polypropylene a year, according to the release. It will be
financed by the partners and by banks, Al-Sada said. Qatar
Petrochemical is 80 percent owned by  Industries Qatar (IQCD)  and 20
percent by  Total SA. (FP)   The signing came after Qatar Petroleum and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc signed a heads of agreement to develop a $6.4 billion
petrochemical plant in the Persian Gulf country in December, a
project first announced in 2010. Qatar, the world’s biggest
exporter of liquefied natural gas, seeks to diversify away from
petroleum exports by developing industries that make
petrochemicals, fertilizer and aluminum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
