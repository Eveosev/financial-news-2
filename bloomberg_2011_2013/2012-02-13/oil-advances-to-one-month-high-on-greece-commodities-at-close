percent to 1,612.41.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil rose to a one-month high after the Greek
parliament approved an austerity plan, easing  Europe ’s debt
crisis, and sanctions tightened on  Iran .  Global equities advanced after passage of the Greek package
needed for 130 billion euros ($172 billion) in aid. Companies
controlling more than 100 supertankers said they would stop
loading cargoes from Iran, the second-biggest producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Oil futures for March delivery increased 2.3 percent to

percent to $3.0125 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to

biggest metals consumer.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for March delivery
declined 0.6 percent to $3.8395 a pound.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 0.7 percent to $8,425 a metric ton ($3.82 a pound).  Aluminum, zinc, nickel, lead and tin also declined in

percent to $2.431 per million British thermal units.  U.K. gas for next-day delivery fell to the lowest in more
than two weeks amid speculation that rising temperatures will

therm, the lowest since Jan. 27, and traded at 57.4 pence a
therm, or $9.05 per million Btu, at 4:39 p.m.  London  time,
