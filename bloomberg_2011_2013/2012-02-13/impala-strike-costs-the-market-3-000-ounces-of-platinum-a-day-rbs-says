The strike at  Impala Platinum
Holdings Ltd. (IMP) ’s Rustenburg mine in South Africa is costing the
market about 3,000 ounces of metal a day, equivalent to about 17
percent of estimated global supply in 2012, according to Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  This has buoyed platinum prices and led to the “collapse”
in the gold-platinum premium, analysts  Nick Moore  and Nikos
Kavalis wrote in a report today. “We expect this trend will
continue and forecast gold will move to a discount against
platinum” by the fourth quarter of the year, they wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
