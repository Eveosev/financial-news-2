Somalia ’s government said al-Qaeda’s
announcement that the al-Shabaab militia had officially joined
the organization will destabilize the war-torn nation even
further while increasing security risks in the region.  Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri announced on Feb. 9 that
al-Shabaab, which has waged an insurgency against Somalia’s
United Nations-backed government since 2007, joined its ranks
“to support the jihad unity against the Zionist crusader
campaign,” according to a  video  posted on the website of al-
Arabiya, the Dubai-based broadcaster.  “Their union will increase insecurity in Somalia,
East Africa and the rest of the world,” the government said in
an e-mailed statement today from Mogadishu, the capital. Somalia
also risks becoming an al-Qaeda base in  East Africa , it said.  Somalia has been wracked by a civil war since the ouster of
Mohamed Siad Barre, the former dictator, in 1991. Al-Shabaab,
which controls most of southern and central Somalia, has been
fighting President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed’s administration
in Mogadishu in a bid to establish an Islamic state.  The government urged the international community to end an
arms embargo against the country and help reinforce the Somali
National Army to help defend the country against al-Qaeda.
Sheikh Sharif’s security forces are supported by more than
10,000 African Union peacekeepers.  It urged supporters of al-Shabaab to “lay down their arms
and follow the peaceful way within 15 days,” without saying what
action would be taken beyond that deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
