Hong Kong ’s economy may shrink this
quarter if exports fail to improve amid faltering global growth,
Financial Secretary  John Tsang  said.  “I see a difficult year ahead for the global economy,”
Tsang said in a  transcript  of a radio broadcast, posted on a
government website yesterday. “We may even see negative growth
in the first quarter of this year if exports fail to pick up.”  Tsang pledged an HK$80 billion ($10.3 billion) boost to
growth in the fiscal year starting in April, with measures
including tax rebates, waivers on homeowner taxes and aid for
small businesses.  Gross domestic product  may rise between 1
percent and 3 percent in 2012, down from 5 percent last year,
the government estimates.  The financial secretary didn’t specify whether any
contraction would be year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter. The
economy grew 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous
three months.  The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.3 percent as of 10:47
a.m. local time after Greek lawmakers approved austerity
measures to secure a bailout.  In a sign of the toll that weakness in global demand is
taking on Asian economies,  Japan  today reported an annualized
2.3 percent contraction in the fourth quarter on export declines
and disruption from floods in Thailand.  China ’s trade fell for
the first time in two years in January, partly because of the
disruption of a weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, the government
said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
