Iceland property sales rose 22
percent last week as the island’s economy recovers from its 2008
banking failure.  There were 115 homes and commercial properties sold in the
week through Feb. 9, compared with 94 sales a week earlier,
according to an e-mailed statement today from Reykjavik-based
 Registers Iceland . The value of the properties sold rose 37
percent to 3 billion kronur ($25 million), the office said.  Iceland’s 2008 banking meltdown left in its wake a burst
property bubble that wrecked the economy. Housing, measured as a
subcomponent in the country’s consumer price index, has yet to
regain pre-crisis values and prices remain about 3 percent below
levels in September 2008, one month before the country’s biggest
banks failed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
