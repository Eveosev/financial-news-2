The National Bank of  Serbia  is
carefully monitoring price and exchange-rate pressures, fiscal
policy risks and  Europe ’s debt crisis for the direction of its
interest-rate policy.  After seven rate cuts since June to 9.5 percent, the
Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije left its  two-week repurchase
rate  on hold on Feb. 9 amid renewed dinar weakness and reports
the government froze a $1.3 billion precautionary loan program
with the  International Monetary Fund  until parliamentary
elections in May are over.  The bank expects weak demand as a result of high
unemployment and “a deteriorating economic growth outlook” to
keep inflation subdued during the first quarter, it said in a
quarterly report in Belgrade today. Price pressures will
probably increase after the elections and with the start of the
new farming season, the report said.  The central bank will do all it can to smooth “excessive
short-term oscillations” in the dinar  exchange rate  and make
sure it doesn’t affect inflation. It aims to ensure stability of
the foreign-exchange market and will refrain from spending funds
from foreign-currency reserves to “intervene to defend the
level exchange rate,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
