Industries Qatar (IQCD) , the Persian Gulf
country’s second-largest company by market value, said fourth-
quarter profit fell 19 percent from a year earlier, missing
analyst estimates.  Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 was 1.7
billion riyals, the company said in an e-mailed release. The
median estimate of 5 analysts was for a profit of 2.04 billion
riyals, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  The “impact of lower petrochemical prices largely offset
by higher fertilizer volumes” will lead to a “muted
performance” compared with the third quarter, Ahmed Shams El
Din, Cairo-based director of equity research at EFG-Hermes
Holding SAE, said in an e-mail before the results were
announced. El Din said he forecast net income of 2.04 billion
riyals for the company.  Ethylene prices in  Japan  were $1,205 a metric ton on Feb.
3, 6.6 percent lower than a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Qafco-5, a new plant owned by Industries
Qatar’s fertilizer unit, is scheduled to reach full output this
month after construction was finished last year, raising ammonia
output by 73 percent.  Industries Qatar’s results come after Saudi Basic
Industries Corp., the world’s largest petrochemicals maker, said
fourth-quarter profit dropped 10 percent, missing analysts’
estimates.  Industries Qatar’s  share price  fell 0.3 percent today to
134 riyals. The price has declined 10 percent over the past year
compared with a 3.6 percent decline for the QE Index of Qatari
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
