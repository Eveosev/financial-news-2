Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
biggest wind turbine maker, fell in Copenhagen trading, after
Exane BNP Paribas cut its valuation of the company in half.  Vestas fell as much as 1.1 percent,  reversing  a gain of
much as 2.4 percent earlier today. The stock declined 0.5 krone
to 56.65 kroner at 1:23 p.m. in the Danish capital giving the
Aarhus, Denmark-based company a market value of 11.5 billion
kroner ($2.05 billion).  Exane today cut its share price estimate to 25 kroner from
50 kroner and repeated an “underperform” recommendation.
Vestas last week reported sales that missed its forecast, said
its chief financial officer stepped down and its chairman will
leave next month. Exane’s target is the lowest of 22 analyst
valuations  tracked by Bloomberg , and compares with an average
12-month price of 58.42 kroner a share. Vestas peaked at 692
kroner a share on June 17, 2008.  The “management shake-up looks unlikely to overcome the
tough industry environment,” Arnaud Brossard, a Paris-based
analyst with Exane, said in the note. He characterized Vestas’s
2012 sales forecast as “optimistic.”  Last week’s resignation of CFO Henrik Norremark came less
than four weeks after he was promoted to deputy chief executive
officer. Chairman Bent Erik Carlsen and Deputy Chairman Torsten Erik Rasmussen won’t stand for re-election at the March annual
general meeting, Vestas also said.  The company said Feb. 8 it expects 2012 revenue of 6.5
billion euros ($8.6 billion) to 8 billion euros. Revenue was 5.8
billion euros in 2011, falling short of the company’s initial 7
billion-euro target and missing guidance a month earlier of 6
billion euros.  Vestas last month said it needs to cut 10 percent of its
workforce to adapt to Chinese competition and predicted further
hurdles in the U.S. should federal subsidies expire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
