Canadian natural gas fell as mild
weather across the U.S. adds to a glut of the fuel in
underground storage.  Alberta  gas fell 3.1 percent. U.S. heating demand will
trail normal by 14 percent through Feb. 20, said Belton,
Missouri-based Weather Derivatives. Inventories stood at 2.89
trillion cubic feet as of Feb. 3, 33 percent above the five-year
average, according to the  Energy Department (DOENUST5) .  “The next two withdrawals will be pretty small in
comparison to last year,” said Carl Neill, a consultant with
Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “If the weather cools down in
March we may be able to whittle down some of the surplus.”  Alberta gas for March delivery fell 6.5 cents to C$2.03 a
gigajoule ($1.94 per million British thermal units) at 12:25
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
has lost 29 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 5.2 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.425 per million
Btu as of 12:24 p.m.  Pipeline Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.8 billion cubic
feet, 13 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.87 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.11 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 667 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.78 billion cubic feet today, or 73 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.97
billion cubic feet at 11:05 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
