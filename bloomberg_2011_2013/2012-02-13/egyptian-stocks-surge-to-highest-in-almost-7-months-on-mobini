(Corrects to remove reference to revenue of Mobinil in
fifth paragraph of story first published Feb. 13.)  Egyptian shares soared to the
highest level in almost seven months after  France Telecom SA (FTE) 
agreed to raise its stake in  Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services.   The benchmark  EGX 30 Index  climbed 4.2 percent to 5,099.36
at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the highest since July 25.
Egyptian Co., also known as Mobinil, rallied by the daily limit
of 10 percent, while its parent company  Orascom Telecom Media &
Technology Holding SAE  surged 9.9 percent. Telecom  Egypt , the
country’s monopoly fixed-line phone company, jumped the most
since March.  France Telecom  will buy most of billionaire Naguib Sawiris’s stake in their mobile-phone venture Mobinil at 202.5
Egyptian pounds ($33.54) a share, the Paris-based company said
in a statement today, citing a preliminary agreement. The price
is 62 percent higher than the stock’s Feb. 8 close. Orascom
Telecom Media has called a  shareholders’ meeting  on March 1 to
seek approval for the transaction.  “Mobinil at more than 200 pounds changes valuations for
telecoms in general,” said Ashraf Akhnoukh, senior equity sales
trader at Cairo-based Commercial International Brokerage. “This
is definitely creating positive sentiment and we’re seeing a
domino effect on the rest of the market.”  France Telecom  owns  about 71 percent of Mobinil Telecom
Co., the holding company that owns Mobinil, Egypt’s second-
biggest by subscribers. France Telecom would offer the same
price for Mobinil shares traded on the Cairo exchange, while
Sawiris will retain a 5 percent “economic interest.”  Mobinil rose to 137.89 pounds, the highest level in almost
eight months. Orascom Telecom Media soared to 1.44 pounds, the
highest since shares were listed in Cairo on Jan. 4.  Telecom
Egypt (ETEL)  rallied 9.1 percent to 16.89 pounds.  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI) , Egypt’s biggest
publicly traded lender, rose 4.5 percent to 24.34 pounds, the
highest close since Nov. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
