Peru ’s central bank will probably
increase its benchmark rate to “at least” 5 percent this year,
from 4.25 percent, as domestic demand spurs inflation, Morgan
Stanley said.  Economic activity is “robust” and will accelerate in the
months ahead on private consumption growth and as the government
increases spending,  Daniel Volberg , an economist at Morgan
Stanley, said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
