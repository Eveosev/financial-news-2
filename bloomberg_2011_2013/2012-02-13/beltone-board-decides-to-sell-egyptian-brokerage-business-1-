Beltone Financial Holding (BTFH)  has put
its brokerage business up for sale less than two weeks after its
chairman canceled a plan to sell his stake in the Egyptian
investment bank.  The Cairo-based company didn’t give a reason for the
decision, made at a board meeting yesterday. Beltone will also
sell an administrative building in Smart Village, a  business
park  on the outskirts of Cairo, to “maximize returns for
investors and increase future growth rates,” it said in a
statement to the Egyptian bourse today.  Shares of Beltone  advanced 2.9 percent to 13.37 Egyptian
pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, valuing the company at
111.9 million pounds ($19 million). The stock is down 1 percent
this year, compared with a 41 percent surge in the benchmark  EGX
30 Index. (EGX30)   The asset sales come after Chairman Aladdin Saba canceled
the sale of his 20 percent stake in Beltone to Arabia
Investments & Development & Financial Investments Holding Co. on
Feb. 1. Beltone ended talks merge with Egyptian investment bank
Pioneers Holding in 2010, even after shareholders of both firms
approved the deal.  Saba didn’t return calls and a text message to his mobile
telephone seeking comment. Osama Rashad, a spokesman for
Beltone, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
