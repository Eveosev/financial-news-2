Northern Chile’s Chuquicamata copper
mine is returning to normal operations and the Radomiro Tomic
copper mine is back online after heavy rains halted operations
yesterday, state copper company Codelco said.  Chuquicamata’s smelting operations are working normally and
the mine “slowly” restarted operations at 6:00 a.m. local time
today, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Codelco is
limiting vehicle access to the mine because of fog, it said.  The company’s Ministro Hales and Minera Gaby operations
weren’t impacted by the weather, Codelco said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
