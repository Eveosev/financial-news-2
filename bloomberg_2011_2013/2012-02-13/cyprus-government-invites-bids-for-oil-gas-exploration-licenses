Cyprus has invited companies to
apply for oil and gas licenses for 12 blocks in its  exclusive
economic zone .  “Applications may be submitted within 90 days of the date
of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the
European Union,” the government said today in a  statement  on
the website of the  Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism .  Applicants will have to satisfy financial and technical
criteria and show an efficient and responsible record in other
countries, the ministry said.  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) , the U.S. company which has the license
to explore and exploit gas in Block 12 of the island’s offshore
territory, said on Dec. 28 that it discovered as much as 8
trillion cubic feet of gas off the island’s southern coast,
Cyprus’s first ever discovery.  -- Editors: Tim Farrand, James Kraus  To contact the reporter on this story:
