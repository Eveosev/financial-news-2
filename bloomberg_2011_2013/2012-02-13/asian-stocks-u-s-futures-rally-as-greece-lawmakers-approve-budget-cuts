longest run of weekly gains since 2005, after  Greece ’s

debt bailout.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. rallied 5 percent in Sydney as
metal prices advanced and a report said Teck Resources Ltd.
bought a stake in the iron-ore producer.  Tokyo  Electric Power

Hong Kong stocks rose after Premier Wen Jiabao said the nation
needs to start “fine-tuning” economic policy this quarter amid
signs growth is slowing.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.6 percent to 125.65 as
of 7:56 p.m. in Tokyo, after falling 1.4 percent on Feb. 10.

for austerity measures to secure a 130 billion euro ($172
billion) international bailout as rioters protesting the cuts
battled police and set fire to buildings in  Athens .  Passage of the austerity bill puts the spotlight on a
meeting of euro-region finance ministers on Feb. 15 that must
decide whether to approve the second aid package. Resolution of
the negotiations, which started in July, would help contain the
threat that speculators will target debt-saddled nations,
including Italy and Portugal.  Fortescue led mining share higher today, rallying 5 percent

after Nomura Holdings Inc. raised its recommendation for the
shares to “buy” from “neutral.”  Chinese banks rose after reported comments by Premier Wen

monetary policy. Economic circumstances in the first quarter
deserve attention, Wen told business executives last week in
Beijing, the official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday.  Among shares that fell, China Resources Land Ltd., a
property developer, dropped 5.8 percent to HK$14.02. The shares
slipped after new lending in China missed estimates in January
and the eastern city of Wuhu backtracked on proposals to ease
real-estate market controls.  Stocks in the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  are valued at 14.1
