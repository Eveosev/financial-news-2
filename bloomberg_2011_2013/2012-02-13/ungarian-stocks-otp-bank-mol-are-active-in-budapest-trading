snapping the biggest two day decline in more than a month.  The following are among the most active equities in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , the biggest lender in Hungary,
gained 1.5 percent to 4,030 forint, tracking financial companies
worldwide as passage of the Greek austerity bill fuelled
optimism that euro-region finance ministers will approve a
second bailout package on Feb. 15 to avert default.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL HB) advanced 0.8 percent to 19,550 forint,
snapping a four-day losing streak. Hungary’s largest refiner

international bailout, while concern grew that a ban on Iranian
oil may constrict supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
