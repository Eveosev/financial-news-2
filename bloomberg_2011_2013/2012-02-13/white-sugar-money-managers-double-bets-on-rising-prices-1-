Money managers more than doubled
their net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, in  London 
white sugar futures and options, according to NYSE Liffe, the
derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext.  Net-long positions totaled 9,034 futures and options as of
Feb. 7, up from 4,128 contracts a week earlier, the weekly
commitments of traders report published on the exchange’s
website today showed. White sugar for March delivery climbed 2.6
percent in the period on speculation supplies for delivery may
be limited before the March futures expire tomorrow.  “With major white sugar exporters like the European Union
and  India  not being able to deliver against Liffe, quantities
deliverable against March expiry in London are rather limited,”
Fabienne Pointier, an analyst at broker and researcher Kingsman
SA in Lausanne,  Switzerland , said in an e-mail today. “This
could help the London futures to firm up before expiry.”  In cocoa, money managers trimmed their net-long position by
60 percent to 1,774 futures and options as of Feb. 7, the data
show. Cocoa slipped 1.7 percent in the period.  Money managers were net-short, or betting on lower prices,
in robusta coffee and feed wheat. Net-short positions in coffee
totaled 6,873 contracts as of Feb. 7, compared with 6,685 on
Jan. 31, while net-short positions in feed wheat stood at 602
futures and options from 480 a week earlier, the data show.  Robusta coffee climbed 1.4 percent in the period, while
feed wheat advanced 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
