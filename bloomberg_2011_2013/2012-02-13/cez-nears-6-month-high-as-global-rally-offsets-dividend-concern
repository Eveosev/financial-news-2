CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility in
the  Czech Republic , gained to near a six-month high as austerity
plans approved by Greece boosted demand for riskier assets
worldwide, outweighing concern the company may cut its dividend.  State-run CEZ increased 1.9 percent to 820 koruna by 12:03
p.m. in Prague, 3.9 koruna shy of 823.9 koruna reached on Feb.
8, which was the stockâ€™s highest intraday price since Aug. 8.  Global stocks advanced after passage of the Greek austerity
bill fueled optimism that the country will secure a second aid
package. CEZ advanced even after Czech Industry and Trade
Minister Martin Kuba said yesterday that the company should
finance the planned construction of new nuclear reactors on its
own even if it requires reducing the dividend payout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
