The Defense Department may have to
force soldiers, Marines or other members of the military out of
the services for the first time since the aftermath of the Cold
War to achieve the spending reductions in its budget proposal.  The Pentagon plans to cut 67,100 soldiers from active and
reserve Army units and the Army National Guard in the five years
starting Oct. 1, as well as 15,200 from the active and reserve
ranks of the Marine Corps as part of an effort to save $487
billion over a decade, according to the budget sent to Congress
today. The Navy and Air Force would lose fewer people -- 8,600
and 1,700 respectively -- because of their role in a strategic
shift toward the Asia-Pacific region and the  Middle East .  The military will first try buying out contracts or
offering bonuses for people to leave, while working to keep
those with valuable specialties such as cyber warfare and
acquisitions, according to Travis Sharp, a fellow at the  Center
for a New American Security , a Washington policy group, who
attended a Pentagon briefing for analysts last month.  “I was surprised that they were going to complete the
reductions to the Army and the Marine Corps in just five
years,” Sharp said in an interview before the budget was
released. “What they told us is that they will try to use those
types of positive incentives to the greatest extent possible,
but that involuntary separations would probably still be
necessary.”  The Pentagon has said it is aiming to a create a smaller,
more agile military. Special operations forces, whose commandos
killed  Osama bin Laden  last year, would be expanded.  Republican Opposition  Republicans in Congress already have signaled they will
challenge the  Pentagon reductions  when lawmakers take up the
proposed fiscal 2013 budget that President  Barack Obama  sent to
Congress today.  Representative Howard “Buck” McKeon, the Republican
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, cited a comment
by White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew in an interview on NBC’s
“Meet the Press” that “the time for austerity is not today.”  “They’ll have a tough time explaining that to the 100,000
troops who will be forced from service under the president’s new
budget plan,” McKeon of California said today in a statement.  The cuts, spurred in part by plans to wind down the war in
Afghanistan in the next three years, would mark the first time
the U.S. military has forced personnel out of the services since
the larger troop reduction after the end of the Cold War with
the  Soviet Union .  Service Options  The military services, which decide how to achieve the
cuts, may be able to tighten re-enlistment standards and offer
incentives to leave, Defense Department Comptroller Robert Hale
said.  “I don’t think we can stand here and say there won’t be
any involuntary separation,” Hale told reporters at the
Pentagon today. “We have very high retention right now with the
economy still fairly weak. If that changes, it will be easier.
If it doesn’t, it will be harder.”  The department will seek to “do this in as humane a way as
we can,” Hale said.  The prospect of cutting the U.S. military to about 2.15
million people by October 2017, a reduction of 92,600 starting
next year, creates political risks for Obama in an election
year, and economic risks as military personnel enter the
 civilian workforce  in coming years, Sharp said. Including
reductions in the current year, the plan would eliminate 123,900
positions from all the branches.  ‘Kicking People Out’  “You are kicking people out of the military at a time when
 unemployment  is not only a major challenge, it is also a primary
factor in the upcoming presidential election,” Sharp said.
“They will have to start the machinery and the process of
implementing these drawdowns this year.”  The reductions would start with 31,300 uniformed positions,
or 1.4 percent, eliminated in the 12 months starting Oct. 1,
cutting the force size to 2,238,400 from 2,269,700 this year,
according to the proposal.  After the  Cold War , the military pared its active-duty
ranks by 494,000 from 1991 to 1995, according to the Defense
Department comptroller’s office. That included 216,000 from the
Army and 21,000 from the Marine Corps. Further cuts followed in
the next few years, ending just before the Sept. 11 terror
attacks by al-Qaeda.  Junior Officers  The Army forced more than 5,300 out of its officer ranks
alone in the five years ended Sept. 30, 1997, according to a
report published in October 2000 by a researcher at the U.S.
Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute. The study found
forced exits also contributed to attrition in the ranks of
younger officers.  “With junior officers witnessing such an array of policies
designed to entice or force over 23,000 of their peers and role
models to leave, it is not surprising that their loyalty to the
military has been redefined with a healthy dose of skepticism,”
the researcher, Leonard Wong, wrote in the report.  The Army’s budget director, Major General Phillip McGhee,
told reporters at the Pentagon today that his service will rely
first on on-time and early retirements, reducing recruitment and
other steps before resorting to involuntary measures.  “We really want to put minimum stress on the force as we
do the rampdown,” McGhee said.  Protracted Conflicts  In addition to focusing more national security attention on
 Asia  and the Middle East, the Pentagon’s revised strategy
outlined last month sets aside previous assumptions that the
military plan for large and protracted conflicts such as  Iraq 
and  Afghanistan .  The cuts in uniformed personnel are in keeping with
proposed steps such as eliminating eight Army brigades, five
Marine infantry battalions and four of the Corps’s tactical air
squadrons. The Air Force would lose 303 aircraft and six fighter
squadrons, while the Navy jettisons seven cruisers and 2 dock
landing ships.  “In preparing this budget, we endeavored to avoid the
mistakes of previous drawdowns that attempted to maintain more
force structure than the budget could afford,” the department
wrote in a Jan. 26 summary of its five-year priorities.  Cuts by Service  Today’s budget proposal fleshes out the cuts for each of
the military branches.  Army forces would be reduced by less than 1 percent to
1,115,300 in 2013 and then drop to 1,048,200 in 2017. That’s
still far greater troop strength than in February 2002, a year
before the U.S. invasion of Iraq, when the Army numbered about
480,000 on active duty.  The Navy would have 1.7 percent fewer personnel, or 385,200
in 2013, and faces a reduction of 3.9 percent to a total of
376,600 people in 2017.  The Marines would be down to 236,900 in 2013, or 2 percent
fewer than this year. By the end of 2017, the Marines face a
reduction of 8.3 percent from this year to 221,700.  The  Air Force  will have 501,000 personnel in 2013, or 1.9
percent fewer than this year. In 2017, Air Force personnel will
decline to 499,300.  To contact the reporters on this story:
