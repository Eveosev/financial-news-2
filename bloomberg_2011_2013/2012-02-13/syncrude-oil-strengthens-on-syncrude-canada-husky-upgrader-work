The discount for Syncrude oil surged
because of work at a Syncrude  Canada  Ltd. coker and planned
maintenance at Husky Energy Inc.’s Lloydminster upgrader.  Syncrude Canada’s 8-1 coker is under assessment and is
being cleaned out, Ryan Kubik, Canadian  Oil Sands  Ltd.’s chief
financial officer, said at the Credit Suisse Group AG 2012
Energy Summit Feb. 9. Canadian Oil Sands is the largest
shareholder in Syncrude Canada.  Husky Energy Inc. said the same day that it plans a three-
week outage in the first half of this year at the Lloydminster
oil-sands unit in Alberta.  The discount for  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  against West Texas Intermediate
