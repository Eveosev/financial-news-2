Zodiac Exploration Inc. (ZEX) , which
explores for oil and natural gas in  California , plunged the most
in 22 months after it damaged a well during horizontal drilling.  The  shares  fell 28 percent to 14 Canadian cents at 10:54
a.m. in Toronto, after dropping as much as 31 percent, the
biggest decline since March 25, 2010.  Zodiac was forced to clean up a well in Kings County,
California with foamed acid after possible damage to the
hydraulic fractures and the reservoir, the Calgary-based company
said in a statement today. The type of drilling being done on
the well is new to California, it said.  “Limitations of the surface and downhole equipment
available to us, and the downtime caused by failure of key
pumping units during the critical phase of the operation, has,
in our view, limited our ability to achieve optimal flow
rates,” said Chief Executive Officer Murray Rodgers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
