Nigeria ’s army killed 12 suspected
Islamist militants in a gun battle late yesterday, the military
said, as Taliban-inspired Boko Haram threatened to attack phone
service providers for cooperating with authorities.  Two soldiers were injured when Boko Haram suspects opened
fire on a military patrol in the northeastern city of Maiduguri,
the capital of Borno state, Hassan Mohammed, a spokesman for the
military’s joint task force said today by phone from the city. A
person identifying himself as Boko Haram’s spokesman said today
his group killed 12 soldiers in the gunfight.  Boko Haram will step up its attacks to target phone service
providers in Nigeria for cooperating with the authorities,
allowing security agencies to track them down, Abu Qaqa, the
purported spokesman who uses a voice-alteration device, said
today by phone to reporters in the city before the military
statement was issued.  Authorities in  Africa ’s top oil producer blame Boko Haram,
which calls for the imposition of Shariah law in Nigeria, for
bomb and gun attacks in northern Nigeria and the capital Abuja
since 2009. Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is
a sin,” claimed responsibility for multiple blasts and attacks
in the northern city of Kano on Jan. 20, killing at least 256
people, according to the rights group Civil Rights Congress.  The group also vowed to attack the  Nigerian Communications
Commission , the regulatory authority for the
telecommunications industry in the West-African country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
