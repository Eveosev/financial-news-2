Tanzania ’s benchmark coffee grade
fell 0.2 percent to $246.08 per 50-kilogram (110 pounds) bag at
an auction, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  That compares with $246.49 a week earlier, the board said
today by e-mail from Moshi, in northern Tanzania. Supplies of
the grade rose 64 percent to 4,728 bags, it said. The average
price rose to $5.55 per 50-kilogram bag, the board said.  Supplies of the beans at the auction rose to 16,367 bags,
the board said, adding they were all arabica. Sales advanced to
11,334 bags from 9,826 bags on Feb. 2, as buyers replenished
their stocks because the board won’t have an auction this week,
it said. Tanzania prices its coffee per 50 kilograms while
offers and sales are in 60 kilogram-bags.  Production for this marketing season, which started July 1
and closes June 30, may fall to 37,000 metric tons from the July
14 forecast of 45,000 tons because of bad weather, Adolph
Kumburu, the board’s director general, said on Jan. 30. The
country produced 56,247 tons last season.  The next auction is set for Feb. 23, the board said.  The following are details of the Feb. 9 auction in U.S.
