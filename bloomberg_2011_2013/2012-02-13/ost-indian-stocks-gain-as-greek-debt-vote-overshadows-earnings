Most Indian stocks rose, tracking
European equities, as the Greek parliament approved austerity
measures to avert a potential debt default, overshadowing
corporate earnings that lagged behind analyst estimates.  Hindalco Industries Ltd., the aluminum maker that controls
U.S.-based Novelis Inc., climbed for the first time in three
days.  State Bank of India , the biggest lender, tumbled while
 Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s biggest producer of the fuel,
gained after their earnings report today.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.1 percent
to 17,759.75, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai. Two shares gained for each that dropped on the
gauge, which lost 0.5 percent intra-day. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index increased 0.7 percent to 263.1 at 9:52 a.m. in  London .  Companies from DLF to  Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM)  posted
third-quarter profits that missed forecasts amid higher funding
costs. Thirteen out of 26, or 50 percent, of Sensex companies
have reported profits that missed  estimates , up from 40 percent
in the September quarter. The Sensex has still risen for six
weeks, the longest stretch in 21 months, as  foreigners  bought a
net $4 billion of stocks this year, compared with an outflow of
$512 million in 2011.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  won parliamentary
approval for austerity measures to secure an international
bailout. India’s factory  output  rose 1.8 percent in December,
the government said Feb. 10, missing the 2.6 percent median of
23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. The slowdown stoked
concerns growth is cooling after the government forecast the
weakest expansion in the economy since 2009.  The Sensex has rallied 15 percent this year as the rupee
jumped from a record low, the central bank pared banks’ reserve
requirements for the first time since 2009 and inflation eased.
The gauge trades at 15.7 times estimated  earnings , compared with
19.4 times at end of 2010. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index
trades at 10.4 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
