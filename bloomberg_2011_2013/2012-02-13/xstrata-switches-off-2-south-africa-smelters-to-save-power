(Corrects to say company switches off furnaces in first
and second paragraphs.)  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  said it switched off two
of its chrome furnaces in Rustenburg,  South Africa , to help
Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the nation’s power utility, stabilize
the electricity grid.  The furnaces’ maintenance has been brought forward from
South African winter months and output has shifted to its Lion
and Lydenburg smelters that use 33 percent less electricity than
Rustenburg, spokesman Songezo Zibi said by mobile phone today.
The shutdowns won’t affect total production, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
