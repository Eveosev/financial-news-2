The premium for white sugar over the
raw sweetener rose to the highest this year on speculation
supplies for delivery into the March futures are limited.  White sugar for March delivery was $113 a metric ton more
than raw sugar for delivery the same month at 11:55 a.m. in
 London , data on Bloomberg show. That’s up 28 percent this year.
The March white sugar contract on NYSE Liffe expires tomorrow.  “With major white sugar exporters like the European Union
and  India  not being able to deliver against Liffe, quantities
deliverable against March expiry in London are rather limited,”
Fabienne Pointier, an analyst at Kingsman SA, said in an e-mail
today. “This could help the London futures to firm up before
expiry, pushing the white premium up.”  Millers in  Thailand , the second-biggest shipper, have been
focusing on producing more raw sugar at the expense of refined
sugar, Peter de Klerk, an analyst at C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures
Ltd. in London, said on Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
