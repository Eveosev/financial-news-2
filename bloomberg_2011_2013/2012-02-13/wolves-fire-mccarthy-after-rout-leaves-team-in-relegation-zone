Wolverhampton Wanderers fired coach
Mick McCarthy a day after the English Premier League club
slipped into the relegation zone following a 5-1 home defeat to
West Brom.  McCarthy has been subjected to criticism from Wolves
supporters this season, including hundreds who protested
following yesterday’s collapse against West Brom, which scored
four unanswered goals in the last 30 minutes.  “The board took the difficult decision to terminate Mick’s
contract after a run of form which has seen Wolves pick up only
14 points in the last 22 League games,” a club statement posted
on Wolves website said today.  McCarthy’s assistant Terry Connor will be interim manager,
the club said. Wolves are in 18th place, even on points with
Blackburn and Queens Park Rangers.  “I would think it was one of the most disappointing
afternoons of my career,” McCarthy said after the West Brom
defeat. “I apologize for the performance and I’ve never done
that before. But the way we capitulated in the last half-hour is
not associated with my teams.”  The 53-year-old took over in July 2006, leading Wolves to
the Championship title in the 2008-2009 season before keeping
the team in the Premier League for the past two seasons. He was
with Sunderland for three seasons after taking the Irish
national team to the 2002  World Cup  in  Korea  and  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
