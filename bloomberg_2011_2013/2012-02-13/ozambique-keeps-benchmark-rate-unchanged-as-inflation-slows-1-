Mozambique’s central bank kept its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for a second month as
inflation in the southern African nation slowed to an almost
two-year low.  The standing lending facility rate was kept at 15 percent,
the Maputo-based Bank of Mozambique said in an e-mailed
statement today. The bank lowered the lending rate 100 basis
points in December. It kept the standing deposit rate unchanged
at 5 percent today.  Inflation slowed to 6.1 percent in December, the lowest
level since January 2010, as the currency’s gains helped to curb
price pressures. The central bank reduced borrowing costs last
year to help support economic growth as the debt crisis in
 Europe  undermines the global recovery. The bank said it will
will target 5.6 percent inflation this year.  Mozambique ’s economy expanded 6.7 percent in the third
quarter from a year ago, the statistics agency said on Dec. 28.
Mozambique’s metical gained 19 percent against the dollar in
2011, the second-best performer of more than 160 currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  The central bank will intervene in the  interbank market  to
make sure that  money supply  does not exceed 33 billion meticais
($1.2 billion), it said.  Mozambique will “cautiously” ease monetary policy, the
government said in a letter posted on the International Monetary
Fund’s website on Dec. 9. GDP will grow about 8 percent annually
in the “medium term,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
