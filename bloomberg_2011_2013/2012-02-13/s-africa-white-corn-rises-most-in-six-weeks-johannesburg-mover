South African white corn for July
delivery rose the most in almost six weeks as rains in growing
areas weren’t as strong as anticipated.  The contract, which is the most active for the commodity,
increased as much as 3.5 percent, the most since Jan. 3, to
2,001.80 rand a metric ton and traded 3.2 percent higher at
1,996 rand by 11:01 a.m. in Johannesburg.  No rain is forecast this week for Bothaville, Free State,
the largest corn-growing area in the country, according to the
South African Weather Services’s website. Prices of white corn,
used as the nation’s staple food, declined for two weeks,
retreating 2.4 percent in the five days through Feb. 10.  “We did not have as much rain and as widespread this
weekend as anticipated,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader with
Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd., said in e-mailed comments. “From a
technical point of view, we were due for a bounce.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
