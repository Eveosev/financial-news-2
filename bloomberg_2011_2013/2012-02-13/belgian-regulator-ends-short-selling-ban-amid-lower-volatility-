Belgium  lifted a ban on the short-
selling of financial stocks, the country’s markets regulator
 said  today.  The FSMA said its decision reflected “the lower volatility
of the markets” and a consistent approach with other
authorities, the regulator said on its website today. A ban on
so-called naked short selling would remain in place, it said.
 France  confirmed today that it hasn’t renewed a similar short-
selling ban.  The Belgian curbs are replaced by requirements for traders
to report on their activities and to have a “reasonable
expectation” that they can obtain the securities that they sell
short, the FSMA said.  Authorities in Belgium, France,  Spain  and  Italy  moved to
ban short selling in August in an effort to stabilize markets
after European banks including Societe Generale SA hit their
lowest levels since the credit crisis of 2008.  Short-sellers sell borrowed shares with plans to buy them
back later at a lower price, a practice politicians and some
investors blame for roiling markets. The practice is known as
“naked” when sellers haven’t first taken steps to ensure that
they can borrow the securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
