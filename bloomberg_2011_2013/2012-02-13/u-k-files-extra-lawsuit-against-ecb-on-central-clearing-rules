The U.K. filed an additional lawsuit
against the  European Central Bank  over its plans to block trades
in some euro-denominated securities from being cleared outside
of the 17 countries that share the currency.  U.K. authorities submitted a second case against the ECB at
the European Union’s General Court in Luxembourg on Jan. 27,
according to the court’s website.  The move follows an earlier complaint by the U.K. filed in
October. The new action concerns comments made by the ECB since
the original case was registered, according to the tribunal’s
press service.  The Frankfurt-based ECB declined to comment on the latest
lawsuit.  The case is: T-45/12 pending case,  United Kingdom  v. ECB.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporters on this story:
