U.S. Department of Agriculture
spending would rise 2.5 percent to $154.5 billion in the year
starting Oct. 1 before crop-subsidy cuts kick in, beginning
long-term reductions farmer aid, according to the budget
President  Barack Obama  sent to Congress today.  Ending so-called direct payments, paid to growers of major
crops regardless of commodity prices, would save $22.7 billion
through 2022. Total  farm subsidies , including crop insurance and
conservation, would fall $32 billion over the next decade,
although spending by the agency that administers subsidies would
rise 20 percent to $12.1 billion in fiscal 2013.  Direct payments will end “because fiscal reality
necessitates it,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told
reporters today in Washington after the budget was released.
“We need a safety net, but that safety net’s going to change.”  U.S. farm profits reached a record $98.1 billion in
calendar year 2011, lowering the need for crop subsidies, the
USDA said today, revising an earlier estimate. Land prices also
reached their highest levels last year, the department said. In
2012, net farm income will fall 6.5 percent to $91.7 billion,
the second-highest ever, as feed, fuel and fertilizer costs
rise.  Food Stamps  The  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , or  food
stamps , will pay out $69.9 billion in benefits in 2013, the
USDA said. A record 46.3 million people, more than one of every
six Americans, received assistance in November, the department
said earlier this month. Expenditures for SNAP and related
programs, the department’s biggest budgetary item, would fall
0.9 percent to $87.4 billion in fiscal 2013, as the economy
improves and the number of recipients declines, Vilsack said.  Spending on the  Food Safety and Inspection Service ,
responsible for sanitary conditions in about 6,200 slaughter,
food-processing and import establishments throughout the
country, will fall to $996 million from just over $1 billion in
the current fiscal year.  Cuts will be concentrated in administrative personnel and
won’t affect meatpacking-plant visits required under federal
law,Vilsack said last month.  The USDA spending proposal is part of a $3 trillion budget
plan that calls for the 2013  deficit  to fall to $901 billion
from an estimated $1.3 trillion this year. Vilsack has already
announced that some USDA offices are closing to cut agency costs
and that department employment will decline.  10-Year Plan  Obama last year proposed $33 billion in cuts to farm
programs over 10 years as part of his plan to reduce federal
spending. Some components of that plan are outlined in today’s
budget proposal, including cuts to direct payments and a
reduction in funding for the Conservation Reservation Program,
which pays farmers and ranchers for setting aside
environmentally sensitive land.  Spending for the CRP, the USDA’s biggest environmental
initiative, would fall by $977 million in the next decade by
capping enrollment at 30 million acres. Total enrollment
declined 15 percent to 31.1 million acres in 2011 from a peak in
2007 as higher crop prices drew more land into production  “High commodity prices have lowered demand,” according to
the administration spending plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
