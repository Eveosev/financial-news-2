European (SXXP)  stocks advanced the most in
more than a week after Greek lawmakers approved austerity
measures needed to get the financial rescue the nation seeks.  Mining shares led the rally. Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc
surged 45 percent after  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  said it’s considering
an offer for the company.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  and  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY)  each added 1.6 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  gained 0.7 percent to 263.17 at
the close. The benchmark measure made the “ Golden Cross (SXXP) ,” with
its 50-day moving average rising above the 200-day average for
the first time since Sept. 3, 2010, a signal for further
increases according to some technical analysts.  “The market is relieved that things moved forward in
Greece,” said Peter Braendle, who helps manage $60 billion at
Swisscanto Asset Management AG in Zurich. “It shows that
political solutions can be found in  Europe , albeit in the last
minute.”  The Stoxx 600 has advanced  7.6 percent  this year amid
optimism that the euro area will contain the debt crisis and as
most U.S. economic data beat forecasts.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 16 of the 18 western-
 European (SXXP)  markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index added 0.9
percent.  France ’s CAC 40 Index gained 0.3 percent and  Germany ’s
DAX Index rose 0.7 percent.  Greek Approval  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  won parliamentary
approval for the spending cuts after rioters protesting the
measures battled police and set fire to buildings in downtown
 Athens . A total of 199 lawmakers voted for and 74 against the
austerity plans.  The bill’s passage puts the spotlight on a meeting of euro-
area finance ministers on Feb. 15 that must decide whether to
approve a second aid package. Germany and the European
Commission welcomed Greek approval of the package, suggesting
euro-area finance chiefs will pull  Greece  back from the brink
when they meet.  The European Financial Stability Facility, the region’s
bailout fund, will supply a “significant” portion of the aid
needed for Greece’s rescue, WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing
EFSF Deputy Chief Executive Officer Christophe Frankel.  Italy’s borrowing costs fell at a debt auction today. The
Rome-based Treasury sold 8.5 billion euros of 365-day bills and
3.5 billion euros of 127-day bills at rates lower than in the
previous sales.  Germany sold 3.01 billion euros of six-month bills at an
average yield of 0.0761 percent, up from a negative yield at a
sale on Jan. 9.  Commodity Shares  A gauge of mining shares rallied 1.5 percent for the  best
performance  on the Stoxx 600 as copper rebounded from the
biggest drop in a month.  Rio Tinto Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest
mining companies, added 2 percent to 3,845.5 pence and 1.2
percent to 2,082.5 pence, respectively.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  added
2.6 percent to 2,817 pence.  Cable & Wireless Worldwide surged 45 percent to 28.54 pence
after Vodafone, the world’s largest mobile-phone company, said
it is in an early stage of evaluating a potential bid for the
company. An offer, if made, may be in cash, Vodafone said.  Vodafone may offer 700 million pounds ($1.1 billion) for
C&W Worldwide, Sunday Times of  London  reported yesterday,
without saying where it got the information.  Bank Shares  National Bank of Greece  jumped 9 percent to 2.92 euros,
extending its gains this year to 80 percent. Commerzbank,
Germany’s second-largest lender, climbed 1.6 percent to 2.09
euros.  UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, rose 1.6 percent to
12.93 Swiss francs. Lloyds added 2.3 percent to 35.30 pence.  Banks in France fell after the government ended a ban on
short-selling in the stocks 10 banks and insurance companies,
the country’s markets regulator said today.  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
fell 3.6 percent to 5.13 euros and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA dropped 2.1
percent to 34.33 euros.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA slid 2.2 percent to
22.74 euros.  Areva SA, the French maker of nuclear reactors and fuel,
advanced 4.1 percent to 19.15 euros. Areva will supply
Electricite de France SA with as much as 20,000 metric tons of
uranium over the period 2014 through 2030, the companies said.
EDF may also help finance a new mining project with Areva,
according to the statement.  Nexans, Outotec  Nexans SA (NEX) , the world’s second-largest maker of cables and
wires, rose 0.8 percent to 51.44 euros after it said it has
agreed to buy AmerCable Holdings Inc. for $275 million. The
purchase will be funded from cash reserves, Nexans said.  Outotec Oyj, the Finnish supplier of technology and
services to mining companies, added 2.4 percent to 42.49 euros
after Carnegie ASA raised the stock to “buy” from “hold.”  Alcatel-Lucent, France’s biggest telecommunications-
equipment supplier, dropped 1.9 percent to 1.65 euros after  Andy Perkins , an analyst at Societe Generale SA, cut the company’s
shares to “sell” from “hold.”  Royal Boskalis Westminster NV, the world’s largest dredging
company, slumped 6.2 percent to 28.38 euros. Boskalis said it
