Sudan  and its newly independent
neighbor South Sudan signed an agreement yesterday to cooperate
on the transfer of more than 300,000 people to the south, state-
run SUNA news agency reported.  Under the agreement the two countries will work together so
that the southerners in the north can return using road, air and
river transportation, the Khartoum-based agency said, citing
Social Welfare Minister Amira al-Fadel Mohamed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
