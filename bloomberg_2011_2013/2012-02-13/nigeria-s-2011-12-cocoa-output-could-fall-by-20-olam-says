Output of cocoa from Nigeria, the
fourth-biggest producer, may fall by 20 percent this season due
to rain-induced losses at the start of the growing period,
according to Olam International Ltd.  Cocoa bean purchases from the beginning of the main-crop
season on Oct. 1 to Feb. 7, declined 29 percent to 110,000
metric tons, compared with 155,000 tons a year earlier, Anant
Patil, a business development manager at agricultural commodity
trading company Olam Nigeria Ltd., said by phone from Lagos on
Feb. 9.  “Cocoa is coming out slowly, so I think that the crop is
not as much as last year’s,” Patil said. Rain damaged flowers
on the trees, preventing them from maturing and washing away
fertilizers, he said.  Nigeria ranks behind  Ivory Coast ,  Ghana  and  Indonesia  in
cocoa production, according to the International Cocoa
Organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
