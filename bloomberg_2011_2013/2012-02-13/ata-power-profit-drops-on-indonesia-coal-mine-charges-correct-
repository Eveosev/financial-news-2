(Corrects reason for profit decline in headline, first and
third paragraphs of story published on Feb. 10.)  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) ,  India ’s largest
private utility, posted a 40 percent decline in third-quarter
profit after writing off deferred expenses from coal mines in
 Indonesia .  Group net income fell to 2.66 billion rupees ($54 million)
in the three months ended Dec. 31 from 4.42 billion rupees a
year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said today in a
statement. The median estimate of 13 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg was a profit of 5.21 billion rupees.  Tata Power wrote off 6.48 billion rupees of accumulated
deferred expenses at coal mines at PT Kaltim Prima Coal in the
quarter. The company also took an impairment charge of 1.62
billion rupees on account of rising prices of Indonesian coal to
be used for its $3.8 billion Mundra plant in the western state
of Gujarat. The company has said that the Southeast Asian
nation’s policy of regulating exports of the fuel could double
the cost of generating power at Mundra, which needs 12 million
metric tons a year of the fuel.  Tata Power fell 0.6 percent to 110.80 rupees at close in
Mumbai, before the earnings announcement. The stock has gained
27 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent increase in the
benchmark Sensitive Index.  Net sales rose 51 percent to 66.5 billion rupees. Total
expenses surged 65 percent to 60.03 billion rupees, while
interest expenses almost doubled to 4.2 billion rupees from a
year earlier, the company said in the statement.  Tata Power had a generation capacity of 3,797 megawatts,
according to a  presentation  made to investors in December. It
plans to increase capacity eightfold to 25,000 megawatts by
2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
