A surge in  Norway ’s krone may prompt
the central bank to talk down the currency’s strength as early
as this week as policy makers renew their efforts to support
exports.  The krone rose yesterday to its highest against the euro
since Sept. 8, to 7.5460, and has gained about 4 percent since a
November low. Versus the dollar, the krone yesterday rose to its
strongest since Nov. 13, reaching 5.7106.  The exchange rate continues to be a “challenge” for the
government, Trade Minister Trond Giske said yesterday. The
central bank in September signaled it was ready to take steps to
curb the krone’s appreciation after it soared to an eight-year
high. Those comments helped weaken the  exchange rate , triggering
a 4.8 percent decline from a Sept. 8 peak through a trough two
weeks later. In December, the bank lowered its main rate by half
a point, its first such cut since May 2009.  If the krone’s gains continue this week, central bank
Governor Oeystein Olsen “may talk it down on Thursday, saying
that a too-strong krone will have implications for monetary
policy,” said Bjoern Roger Wilhelmsen, chief interest-rate and
currency strategist at Swedbank First Securities in Oslo, and a
former central bank economist, in an interview.  The krone fell for the first day in six today, losing as
much as 0.4 percent against the dollar before trading little
changed at 5.7211 as of 4:19 p.m. in Oslo. Versus the euro, the
krone traded at 7.5284.  Olsen Address  Olsen is due to give his annual address on the state of
monetary policy on Feb. 16. In a Sept. 8 speech last year, Olsen
warned that the central bank is ready to take “monetary policy
measures” to prevent the krone from appreciating too much and
that the “key policy rate is the relevant instrument” with
which to do so.  The currency’s continued strength is “a headache” for
policy makers, said Kjersti Haugland, a senior economist at DNB
ASA and a former central bank analyst, in an interview. “It
will be a key factor for preventing further increases in Norges
Bank’s policy rate.”  The government needs to “make sure we don’t overstretch
the budget by having too much focus on public spending,” said
John G. Bernander, chief executive officer at the Confederation
of Norwegian Enterprise, in an interview today. “We have two
worrying scenarios for our export industry. One is the
currency,” the other is wage growth, he said.  Spending Rule  The government, which tries to cap spending to 4 percent of
its $560 billion sovereign-wealth fund, estimates expenditure
will reach 3.9 percent this year, or 122 billion kroner ($21
billion). Still, complying with the 4 percent rule doesn’t
preclude faster spending growth as Norway’s wealth fund swells.
In 2001, the roughly 8 percent the government spent of the fund
was equivalent to only 32 billion kroner.  Norway’s currency has strengthened as investors turn to
higher-yielding markets. Even after easing policy, the central
bank’s main rate is at 1.75 percent, compared with 1 percent in
the euro region and a target of zero to 0.25 percent in the U.S.  Norway’s government boasts the biggest budget surplus of
any AAA rated nation and has no net debt thanks to a $560
billion sovereign-wealth fund. Norway’s mainland economy, which
excludes income from oil and shipping, will grow 2.2 percent
this year, the  International Monetary Fund  said Feb. 2. By
comparison, the 17-member euro area will expand just 0.5 percent
in 2012, the European Commission said on Nov. 10.  Erodes Competitiveness  “With a strong economy and other countries doing not so
well that is always a challenge,” Giske said, referring to the
krone’s strength. The government needs to rein in spending and
curb wage growth in order to prevent an appreciation of the
krone that erodes competitiveness, he said.  The central bank is torn between protecting its exporters
through lower rates that cap the krone’s strength and a monetary
policy path that addresses Norway’s household debt growth.  Norway faces “severe” imbalances in its credit and
property markets as households continue to amass debt at
unsustainable levels, Morten Baltzersen, Director General of the
Financial Supervisory Authority in Oslo, said in an interview.  Robert Shiller , the co-creator of the  S&P/Case-Shiller (SPCS20) 
home-price index, said in January Norway is in the grip of a
house price bubble, while the IMF on Feb. 2 warned of real
estate and credit market risks in Norway. Household debt will
reach 204 percent of disposable incomes this year while  house
prices  rose an annual 8.4 percent in January, official data
show.  “If other factors in the domestic economy allow it then
Norges Bank would be prepared to act in order to try and make
the situation less serious for the exporters,” Haugland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
