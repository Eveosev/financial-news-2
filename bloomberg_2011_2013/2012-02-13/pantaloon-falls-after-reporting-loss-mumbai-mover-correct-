Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF)  declined
the most in more than eight weeks after reporting a loss in the
three months ended Dec. 31.  The country’s largest retailer declined 6.7 percent, the
most since Dec. 14, to 176.9 rupees at close in Mumbai today.
India’s benchmark  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  rose 0.1 percent. Pantaloon
has gained 37 percent this year.  The company reported a 79.6 million-rupee ($1.62 million)
loss in the second quarter, compared with a profit of 124
million rupees a year earlier, Mumbai-based Pantaloon said Feb.
10. The median of nine  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg
was for a 442 million-rupee profit. Interest costs increased 63
percent to 2.4 billion rupees.  “Interest cost is just killing them,” Abhishek Ranganathan, a Mumbai-based analyst with MF Global-Sify
Securities Pvt. said in a telephone interview. “The next few
quarters may have low same-store sales growth. High interest
costs along with that is not going to help.”  Pantaloon has been affected by rising borrowing costs after
the  Reserve Bank  of India increased  interest rates  by a record
amount from 2010 until October last year to fight inflation.  India predicted its economy, Asia’s third-largest, will
grow at the slowest pace since 2009, prompting consumers to
spend less. The government on Feb. 7 estimated growth of 6.9
percent for the year ending March 31, following an 8.4 percent
expansion in the previous period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
