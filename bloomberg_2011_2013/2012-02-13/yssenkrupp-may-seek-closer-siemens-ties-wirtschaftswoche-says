ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  and  Siemens AG (SIE)  (SIE)
denied a magazine report they are seeking cooperation that may
lead to an exchange of assets or an outright merger.  WirtschaftsWoche  reported that ThyssenKrupp may seek a
merger with Siemens in the long term as the German steel
manufacturer may not be able to survive on its own, citing
people close to ThyssenKrupp it didn’t identify. The article is
inaccurate, and the companies aren’t in talks, a ThyssenKrupp
spokesman said.  “ThyssenKrupp is among the few companies we have never
discussed as a potential takeover target,” Siemens Chief
Financial Officer Joe Kaeser said. The comment was first
reported by Handelsblatt, and Philipp Encz, a spokesman for
Munich, Germany-based Siemens, confirmed it.  Gerhard Cromme, who heads the supervisory boards of both
companies, and Heinrich Hiesinger, a former executive at Siemens
who now runs ThyssenKrupp, are gathering people around them to
prepare such a maneuver, the magazine said. Berthold Beitz, head
of the foundations that are the largest shareholders in
ThyssenKrupp, also supports the idea, WirtschaftsWoche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
