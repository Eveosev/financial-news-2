KappAhl AB, (KAHL)   Sweden ’s second-largest
listed clothes retailer, fell the most in over two months in
 Stockholm  after saying sales in comparable stores declined
during December and January.  The share fell as much as 9.1 percent, the biggest decline
since Dec. 9. It traded 6.5 percent, or 0.50 krona, lower at
7.20 kronor as of 11:05 a.m. local time. Before today, KappAhl
shares had gained 25 percent this year after losing 77 percent
of their value in 2011.  Sales in stores open at least a year declined 8 percent in
December-January, compared with the same period last year, the
Molndal, Sweden-based retailer said today in a statement.
KappAhl, which primarily targets clients who are mothers and are
shopping also for their children and partners, said the gross
margin declined 5 percentage points in the period. Sales
declined 14 percent in the fiscal first quarter that ended Nov.
30.  “It has been a lot about the women’s range not having
attracted our customers as it should and an adjustment is being
phased in,” Chief Executive Officer Johan Aberg said. “At the
same time, we see that the drop in revenue slowly declines.”  The company has postponed plans to open stores in  Austria 
as it focuses on profitability in existing markets and said
expansion this year and next will be slower than the as many as
25 new outlets annually that are its target. KappAhl will book
costs, mainly related to impairment of fixed assets, of as much
as 100 million kronor in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
