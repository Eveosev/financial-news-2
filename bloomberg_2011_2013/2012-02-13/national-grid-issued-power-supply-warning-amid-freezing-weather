National Grid Plc, manager of the
U.K.’s power network, issued warnings seeking to control
electricity demand and alert generators to switch on generators
in order to ensure adequate supplies.  The network manager posted a “transmission system warning
demand control imminent” notification on  its website  at about
10:30 a.m. London time on Feb. 11. The note is meant to alert
the market of “significant generation shortfalls’ and warns
that the grid may take measures to ensure adequate supplies,
such as curbing deliveries to factories or other large users.  The alert covered the period through 7:30 p.m. on the same
day. Britain’s Met Office issued severe cold weather alerts over
the weekend as temperatures plummeted below freezing across the
nation. Power prices on National Grid’s balancing market, for
immediate deliveries of electricity, rose as high as 246 pounds
a megawatt-hour on Feb. 11, data on the grid manager’s website
show. That compares with about 53.25 pounds for weekend power on
Feb. 10, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  National Grid published a so-called ‘‘inadequate system
margin,” signaling concern that there wasn’t enough spare
generation available, at about 2 p.m. There may have been a
shortfall of 500 megawatts on the day, the grid said. The
notices were later canceled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
