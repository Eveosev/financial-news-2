German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger is at odds with lawmakers from
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats over the ACTA
anti-piracy agreement, the  Passauer Neue Presse  newspaper said.  The justice mninister, a member of Merkel’s Free Democratic
Party coalition partner, seeks clarity from the European
Commission on the legal implications of the Anti-Counterfeiting
Trade Agreement before she signs off on the planned
international agreement, the newspaper reported.  Lawmakers from Merkel’s party including Guenter Krings and
 Wolfgang Bosbach , the chairman of parliament’s all-party
interior-affairs committee, support the aims of ACTA, the
newspaper said. Krings said he seeks a “clear declaration” of
support from Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger for ACTA, it said.  New anti-counterfeiting and copywrite rules are necessary,
Merkel’s chief spokesman  Steffen Seibert  wrote on Twitter
yesterday. “Illegal copying, patent infringements and
counterfeiting causes billions in damages every year,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
