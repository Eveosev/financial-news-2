The U.S. Energy Department’s
advanced-research agency for new technologies terminated support
for six projects in the past year for failing to meet
performance milestones, the head of the agency said.  The projects were discontinued “for a variety of
reasons,” Arun Majumdar, director of the Advanced Research
Projects Agency-Energy, told reporters today. The department
declined to disclose the projects or how much the government has
spent, citing a need to avoid adverse publicity for the
companies, he said.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration requested $350
million for ARPA-E for fiscal year 2013, up from $275 million
last year. The program invests in projects that may be too risky
to win backing from private lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
