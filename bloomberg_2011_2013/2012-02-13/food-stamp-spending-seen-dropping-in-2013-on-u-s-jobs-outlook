Spending on food-stamp benefits
would fall 0.6 percent to $69.9 billion in the 2013 fiscal year
as employment improves, according to projections contained
in the budget President  Barack Obama  submitted to Congress.  Spending for the food-stamp component of the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, still would be the
second-highest on record and 17 percent above 2011, the
government said in its proposal today for U.S. Department of
Agriculture spending. Overall budget authority for all related
initiatives would fall 0.9 percent to $87.4 billion.  “SNAP is the cornerstone of our nation’s food-assistance
safety net and touches the lives of more than  46 million 
people,” according to the budget document.  Food stamps  have become a theme in this year’s presidential
campaign, as enrollment has increased 47 percent since December
2008, a month before President Barack Obama took office. The
program’s rising cost has been called unsustainable by
Republicans including  Newt Gingrich , who has labeled Obama “the
best food-stamp president in American history.”  About 46.286 million Americans received aid in November,
the last month for which data was available, up 0.1 percent from
October, according to the USDA. Participation was 6.2 percent
higher than a year earlier. The government spent $6.21 billion
on the program for the month, up 6.9 percent from 2010.  The number of Americans receiving assistance under the
program set records every month from December 2008 until June
2011 and has changed little since September. There were two
monthly declines last year through November, partly because of
drops in special assistance to victims of weather disasters.  Joblessness (USURTOT)  fell to 8.3 percent in January from 8.5 percent
in December, the Labor Department said last month.  Food-stamp enrollment tends to lag unemployment gains and
declines. Participation in the program should fall as the
economy improves, according to  Kevin Concannon , the head of the
USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
