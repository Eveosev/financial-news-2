Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , a unit of Societe
Generale SA that took writedowns on Greek bonds last year, rose
the most this month, leading a rally in Czech stocks after
Greece moved closer to receiving a second bailout package.  The stock added 2.9 percent to 3,710 koruna at its close in
 Prague , its biggest one-day gain since Jan. 31. The  PX (PX)  index,
where Komercni has a 17 percent weighting, climbed 2 percent.  Global stocks advanced, with financial companies among the
biggest gainers, after Greek lawmakers approved an austerity
bill needed to secure emergency funding. Komercni Banka wrote
off 4.3 billion koruna ($228 million) on its 7 billion-koruna
portfolio of Greek sovereign debt in 2011.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech power utility, rose 1.7 percent
to 819 koruna. Austriaâ€™s  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  gained 2 percent to
475 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
