The Russian Economy Ministry has
proposed hiring Morgan Stanley to sell the state’s 25 percent
stake in  OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Seaport (NCSP) ,  Vedomosti 
reported, citing a proposal to Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin .  The ministry proposed restricting Summa Capital and  OAO
Transneft (TRNFP) , who combined own a controlling stake in the seaport,
from increasing their holding to avoid the “monopolization of
corporate governance,” the Moscow-based daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
