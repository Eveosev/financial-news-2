China Grain Reserves Corp., the
manager of state grain inventories, is seeking government
approval to trade in overseas  futures markets , the  China
Business Journal  said today.  China Grain Reserves, commonly known as Sinograin, plans to
trade in overseas  commodities markets  to help hedge against its
physical market positions and lower risks, the report said,
citing unidentified officials close to the state-owned Assets
Supervision and Administration Commission.  The company needs approval from the commission as well as
from the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and
Reform Commission before it can trade in overseas futures
markets, it said. A call to the media relations department of
the company was not answered.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
