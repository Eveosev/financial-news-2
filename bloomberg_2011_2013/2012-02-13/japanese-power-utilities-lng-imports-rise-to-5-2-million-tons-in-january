Japan ’s 10 regional power utilities
increased their imports of liquefied natural gas by 39 percent
in January, when most of the country’s nuclear reactors remained
idled over safety concerns.  Power companies imported 5.19 million metric tons of LNG
last month, up from 3.73 million tons a year earlier, according
to data today from the Federation of Electric Power Cos.  Oil imports almost tripled to 1.34 million kiloliters (8.4
million barrels), while  fuel-oil  purchases increased nearly
threefold to 1.51 million kiloliters, according to the data.  The average operating rate of nuclear plants in January was
10 percent, down from 66 percent last year, it said. Thermal-
power generation rose 29 percent from a year earlier.  Japan had three nuclear reactors with a capacity of 3,138
megawatts, or 6.4 percent of the total, operating at the end of
January. Japan ordered safety checks following the meltdowns at
 Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi station last year.  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and purchases of fuel oil, crude, LNG and coal in January. Fuel
oil and crude volumes are in kiloliters, while those for LNG and
coal are in tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
