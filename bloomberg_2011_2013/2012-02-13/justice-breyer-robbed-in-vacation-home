U.S. Supreme Court Justice  Stephen Breyer  was robbed by a man wielding a machete while vacationing
on the West Indies island of Nevis, said  Kathy Arberg , a court
spokeswoman.  Breyer, 73, his wife and two guests were in the justice’s
vacation home when they were confronted by the intruder, who
stole about $1,000, she said. Nobody was injured in the robbery,
which took place at about 9 p.m. on Feb. 9, Arberg said.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting with a
local police investigation, according to a U.S. law enforcement
official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the case publicly.  Breyer was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1994 by
President Bill Clinton. The high court is on its traditional
mid-winter break and will return next week.  Supreme Court  justices often aren’t accompanied by security
in their private activities. In 2004, Justice David Souter, now
retired, was mugged while jogging on a Washington street.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s purse was snatched in 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
