Shares of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  rallied above
$500 for the first time after a two-week gain spurred by the
iPhone maker’s first-quarter earnings report approached 20
percent.  Apple increased 1.9 percent to $502.60 today. In the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN)  and
 Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG)  cost more per share, at $612.20, $571.15
and $503.07, respectively.  “It reminds us all of the amazing transformation of Apple
over the past eight years,”  Timothy Ghriskey , who owns Apple
and oversees $2 billion as chief investment officer of Solaris
Group LLC in Bedford Hills,  New York , said in a telephone
interview today. “We think the stock has higher to go, $600 is
next,” he said. “It’s still an inexpensive stock for a company
that is executing at the very highest level and continues to
innovate.”  Apple has climbed 11 of the 14 days since reporting
quarterly results. Its earnings are expanding so fast that even
with the rally, the shares are trading at less than half their
median valuation since 1990, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The gain since Apple reported results is almost four times as
large as the advance in the Nasdaq-100 Index.  The world’s largest company by market capitalization said
on Jan. 24 that profit in the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $13.1
billion, 36 percent more than the average analyst projection,
while revenue  beat forecasts  by $7.3 billion, the most ever. The
Cupertino, California-based company single-handedly erased a
drop in  S&P 500  earnings for the October-to-December period,
turning a 4.2 percent decline into a 4.4 percent gain.  Shares of the maker of the iPod, iPhone and iPad have risen
17 percent over the past month, the biggest gain since August
2009 rolling back as of Feb. 10. The stock rose 22 percent this
year through the end of last week, compared with a increase of
12 percent for technology companies in the S&P 500.  Analysts see the stock climbing to $575.56, according to
the average of price estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
