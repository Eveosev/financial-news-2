The U.S. Army has proposed buying
fewer medium-duty trucks made by  Oshkosh Corp. (OSK)  to save $2.2
billion during five years, according to a  Defense Department (USBODEFN) 
budget document.  The proposed restructuring of the Family of Medium Tactical
Vehicles, or FMTV, program is “due to Department funding
constraints,” the document says. The move is projected to save
$100 million in fiscal 2013 and the remainder through fiscal
2017, according to the document released today.  The Army would keep more medium-duty cargo trucks called
the M900 to offset any FMTV shortages, it states.  The defense budget for fiscal 2013, which begins Oct. 1,
would spend $377.4 million to buy 1,471 FMTV trucks, down from
an estimated $438 million for 2,524 trucks in fiscal 2012. The
Pentagon in 2010 estimated the program would cost $417.5 million
in the next fiscal year.  Shares of the Oshkosh, Wisconsin-based company fell 62
cents, or 2.5 percent, to $24.30 at 12:47 p.m. in New York
trading. They traded as high as $25.67 earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
