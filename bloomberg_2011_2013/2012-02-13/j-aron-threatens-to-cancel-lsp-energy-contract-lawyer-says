J. Aron & Co., the energy dealer
owned by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , threatened to cancel its
contract with LSP Energy LP because the electricity provider
filed for bankruptcy, LSP’s lawyer said.  “We consider that a violation of the automatic stay,” the
LSP attorney, Martin T. Fletcher, said today in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Wilmington, Delaware, referring to the provision of the
law that temporarily halts legal action against companies in
bankruptcy.  J. Aron is one of two companies that buy electricity from
LSP’s natural-gas fueled power plant in Batesville, Mississippi,
LSP said in court papers. LSP filed for  bankruptcy protection  on
Feb. 10 after an accident and a botched repair last year kept
part of the plant offline since May.  LSP has lost about $19 million because of the disruption,
the company said in court papers. LSP said it plans to finish
repairs and sell the power plant while in bankruptcy. The sale
should bring in enough money to pay all of the $211 million in
long-term debt the company owes, LSP said.  Michael S. Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, declined to
comment on the LSP lawyer’s statement.  The case is In re LSP Energy Limited Partnership, 12-10460,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
