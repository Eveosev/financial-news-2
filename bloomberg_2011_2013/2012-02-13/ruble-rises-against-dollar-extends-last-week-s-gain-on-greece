The ruble strengthened against the
dollar, adding to last week’s gain, after  Greece ’s parliament
approved austerity measures to secure an international bailout,
easing concern over  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 29.8999 per
dollar as of 10:04 a.m. in Moscow, heading for its biggest daily
gain since Feb. 7. The ruble was little changed at 39.625 per
euro and 0.4 percent stronger at 34.2707 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Demand for Russian exports in the European Union, the
country’s biggest trading partner, may rally after Greece passed
the measures necessary to secure a 130 billion-euro ($172
billion) second aid package.  Brent crude  rose 0.8 percent to
$118.28 a barrel.  Russia’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2020 fell, pushing the
yield up three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.268
percent. Dollar-denominated notes due 2015 yielded four basis
points more than on Feb. 10, at 2.945 percent.  Investors pared bets the Russian currency would weaken,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 30.2749 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 30.42 per
dollar on Feb. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
