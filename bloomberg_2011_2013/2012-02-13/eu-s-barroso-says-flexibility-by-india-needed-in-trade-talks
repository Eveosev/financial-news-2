European Commission President  Jose Barroso  pressed India to show the flexibility needed to complete
a free-trade agreement between the two economies.  “I trust it is going to happen if there is some
flexibility on the Indian side,” Barroso said today at an event
in  Mumbai , India. “We are very close to an agreement and I hope
that we can conclude it soon.”  The “real problem” in the trade-deal talks, which have
been going on since 2007, involves “some issues regarding
procurement and services,” Barroso said. “That’s where we have
not yet achieved the level of consensus that is needed,” he
added without being more specific.  Disagreements over Indian duties on cars and spirits and
limited access for  India  to the EU’s labor market have hindered
efforts to reach an accord. “In terms of tariffs, basically the
work is done,” Barroso said today.  At an EU-India summit in  New Delhi  on Feb. 10, the two
sides “made good progress with negotiations on the Free Trade
Agreement, and the perimeter of a final agreement is emerging,”
Barroso said today. “I am confident that we can finalize the
negotiations in the months to come.” Last week, he said the
talks should be completed “this autumn.”  The EU is India’s largest  trading partner , accounting for
14 percent of foreign commerce, and its largest source of
foreign direct investment. A deal between the two economies
would be the biggest trade agreement in the world, delivering
benefits to a combined population of 1.7 billion people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
