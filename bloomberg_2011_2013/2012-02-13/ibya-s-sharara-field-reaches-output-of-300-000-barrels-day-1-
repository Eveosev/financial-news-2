Libya ’s Sharara oilfield has reached
a production level of 300,000 barrels a day, state-owned
National Oil Corp. said on its website.  Sharara, which has a maximum production capacity of 340,000
barrels a day, is operated by Repsol YPF SA’s joint venture
Akakus Oil Operations. The field is located in the Murzuq basin
in southwestern Libya, about 730 kilometers (450 miles) south of
Tripoli, the capital, according to NOC.  Libya, holder of  Africa ’s biggest crude reserves, is
seeking to raise output and exports, which were disrupted last
year by the armed rebellion against Muammar Qaddafi’s regime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
