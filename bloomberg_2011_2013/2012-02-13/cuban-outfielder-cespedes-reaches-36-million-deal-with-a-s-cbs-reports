The  Oakland Athletics  agreed with
Cuban outfielder Yoenis Cespedes on a four-year, $36 million
contract,  CBS Sports  reported without saying where it obtained
the information.  The 26-year-old Cespedes, who shares the Cuban League’s
single-season home run record with 32, became a Major League
Baseball free agent on Jan. 25. He was waiting to be legally
cleared by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign
Assets Control before signing with a team, according to the
report.  Athletics spokesman Bob Rose said in an e-mail that the
team had no comment.  The Athletics are undergoing changes after missing the
playoffs for the fifth consecutive year. General Manager Billy Beane parted ways with starting pitchers Trevor Cahill,
Guillermo Moscoso, and Gio Gonzalez and closer  Andrew Bailey . He
also let starting outfielder Josh Willingham and designated
hitter Hideki Matsui leave via free agency.  Cespedes established legal residence in the  Dominican
Republic  before coming to the U.S. He was pursued by MLB teams
including the Miami Marlins, who offered the outfielder a six-
year, $36 million contract last weekend, according to CBS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
