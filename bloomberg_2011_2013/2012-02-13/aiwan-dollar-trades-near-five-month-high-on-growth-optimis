Taiwan ’s dollar rose toward a five-
month high on optimism the island’s economic growth will prompt
global funds to add to holdings of local assets.  Government
bonds  were steady.  Overseas investors bought $2.7 billion more stocks in
Taiwan than they sold this year, contributing to a 2.6 percent
advance in the currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The government predicts gross domestic product will climb 3.9
percent this year following estimated growth of 4 percent in
2011.  “Funds continue to come into Taiwan as they want to profit
from a stronger currency and the stock performance,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong
Commercial Bank. “They think Asia still has room to grow, as
compared to Europe and the U.S.”  The  Taiwan dollar  climbed 0.1 percent to NT$29.54 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.37 on Feb. 10, the strongest level since Sept. 13.
Importers’ demand for the greenback checked the Taiwanese
currency’s advance, according to Lin.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent notes due January
2017, the most-traded  government securities , was little changed
at 0.95 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was steady at 0.397 percent, according to
a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
