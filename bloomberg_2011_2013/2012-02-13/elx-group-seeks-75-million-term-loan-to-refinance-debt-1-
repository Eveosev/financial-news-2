Telx Group Inc. (TELX) , the data center
operator acquired by Abry Partners LLC and Berkshire Partners
LLC, is seeking a $75 million  term loan  to refinance debt,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The debt, due in September 2017, will pay interest at 6.5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. Libor, a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars
from each other, will have a 1.25 percent floor.  Telx is proposing to sell the loan at 99.5 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  Morgan Stanley and Toronto-Dominion Bank are arranging the
financing and commitments from lenders are due Feb. 16 at 5 p.m.
in  New York , the person said.  Proceeds will be used to repay Telx’s existing $50 million
revolving line of credit due in September 2016 and for general
corporate purposes, said the person.  Abry and Berkshire purchased the New York-based company
company from GI Partners LLC for an undisclosed amount in
September 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chris Downie, chief financial officer of Telx, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
