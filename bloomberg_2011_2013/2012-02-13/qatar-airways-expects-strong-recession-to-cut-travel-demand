Qatar Airways Ltd. Chief Executive
Officer Akbar  Al Baker  said he expects a “strong recession”
that will sap global air-travel demand.  “We will be affected by at least 5 percentage points in
loss of passenger numbers,” Al Baker said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview in  Singapore . “As in any other recession,
all classes will be affected.”  A European sovereign debt crisis is sapping global economic
growth, contributing to  China ’s exports falling for the first
time in two years in January and causing Japan’s economy to
contract in the fourth quarter of last year. The slowdown has
already hit airlines, causing Spanish carrier Spanair SA and
Hungary’s Malev Zrt. to halt operations.  “There will be a strong recession,” Al Baker said.
“There’s some stability in  Asia , but going forward we believe
we will be affected like any other airline.”  Al Baker also he said expected Airbus SAS would resolve an
issue with Airbus SAS A380 planes that has caused wing-rib feet
to crack. Fissures have been found in planes used by  Singapore
Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  and Qantas Airways Ltd.  “It’s a relatively new aircraft and like any new machines
it will have problems,” Al Baker said. “I’m sure Airbus will
overcome this.”  Qatar has ordered 10 A380s. Airbus is yet to begin building
the aircraft, Al Baker said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
