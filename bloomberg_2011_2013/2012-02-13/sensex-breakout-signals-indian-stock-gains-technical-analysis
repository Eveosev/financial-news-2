The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  may
continue a six-week rally after rising above a downward trend
channel, with market momentum reaching the strongest level since
November 2010, according to StockCharts.com Inc.  The benchmark measure for Indian equities, also known as
Sensex, has jumped 17 percent from its 2011 low in December amid
expectation the central bank will reduce borrowing costs to spur
economic growth and as European officials stepped up efforts to
avoid a Greek default. The advance lifted the Sensex out of a
descending channel that’d been in place since November 2010 and
pushed its 20-week Commodity Channel Index, which measures the
gauge’s variation from its mean, above 100.  “This CCI breakout signals an upthrust in bullish
momentum,” Arthur Hill, a technical analyst at Redmond,
Washington-based StockCharts.com, wrote in a note yesterday.
“Combined with the channel breakout, it looks like the 15-month
downtrend in the Sensex is reversing.”  The Sensex surged 157 percent from March 2009 through
November 2010 as the global economy rebounded from the financial
crisis fueled by U.S. subprime mortgage defaults. The index has
since fallen as much as 28 percent as concern grew  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis may trigger a global recession.  The advance since December has brought the index close to
its October intraday peak of 17,908.13, a key resistance point
for the market to overcome, according to Hill. The Sensex added
0.1 percent to 17,772.84 yesterday.  “Follow-through above this high would complete the trend
reversal,” he wrote.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  last month unexpectedly cut the
amount of deposits lenders need to set aside as reserves for the
first time since 2009. The central bank will cut  interest rates 
once it’s confident inflation will keep slowing, Deputy Governor
Subir Gokarn said on Feb. 2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
