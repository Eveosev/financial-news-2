David Bianco , among Wall Street’s
most bullish stock forecasters when he was replaced last year at
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , was named chief U.S. equity strategist
for  Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK)   Bianco started today, said  Amanda Williams , a spokeswoman
for the Frankfurt-based company. Binky Chadha, who held the
position at Deutsche Bank since 2006, is now chief global
strategist, according to Williams. Bianco will report to Steve Pollard, head of research for Americas, while Chadha works for
David Folkerts-Landau, head of global research.  Chadha had the highest year-end forecast for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index when 2011 began, while only three strategists
tracked by Bloomberg News were more bullish than Bianco when he
left Bank of America in September. He was replaced by Savita Subramanian at the second-largest U.S. bank by assets.  Bianco worked at Deutsche Bank before joining UBS AG in
2002. He shifted to Bank of America in 2009. His return to
Deutsche Bank was reported earlier today by Business Insider.  At UBS, Bianco was head of U.S. equity strategy. His
forecast in 2008 that the  S&P 500  would rally to 1,700 was off
by almost 800 points. At the beginning of 2009, Bianco had the
highest forecast, estimating the S&P 500 would climb to 1,300.
Chadha had the second-highest projection, seeing the measure at
1,140 at year-end, compared with the actual close of 1,115.10.  Highest Forecast  Chadha forecast the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities would
climb to 1,500 in 2012. His projection that the S&P 500 would
rally to 1,425 at the end of the last year was the highest out
of 12 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  In his new role, Chadha will research all major asset
classes, Williams said. Prior to his role as chief U.S. equity
strategist, Chadha was the head of macro currency research at
 Germany ’s largest lender and chief of the global markets
division at the  International Monetary Fund .  Chadha was also the most bullish U.S. stocks strategist in
2010. In January 2010, he projected the S&P 500 would climb that
year to 1,325, the highest estimate out of 13 strategists who
predicted on average an increase to 1,225.  To contact the reporter on this story:
