Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , which sells
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone at a loss, says it excluded the device’s
cost from its 2011 bonus calculations for eligible employees.  The move, which also excludes payments from partner
 LightSquared Inc. (SKYT) , made short-term incentive bonuses 73.7
percent of target, up from the 63.7 percent amount that included
these items. Sprint’s long-term incentive bonus rose to 106.5
percent from 91.5 percent of target with the adjustments, the
 Overland Park , Kansas-based company said yesterday in a  filing .  Sprint, the nation’s third-largest wireless phone company,
like bigger rivals  Verizon Wireless  and  AT&T Inc. (T)  sells the
iPhone at a loss to sign up customers on two-year contracts.
Sprint, which has recorded five years of consecutive losses,
said it sold 1.8 million iPhones in the fourth quarter and saw
its subsidy costs increase about 40 percent.  The carrier, which started selling the iPhone in October,
says it’s now on equal footing with its competitors.  “The company believes that the investment it is making in
the iPhone will be beneficial to our shareholders in the long-
term,” Sprint said in yesterday’s filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
