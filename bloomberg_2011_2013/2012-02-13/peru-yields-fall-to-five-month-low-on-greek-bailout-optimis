Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields to a five-month low, after Greek lawmakers approved
austerity plans to secure a bailout, boosting investor appetite
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.58 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest since Sept. 15. The security’s
price rose 0.13 centimo to 115.08 centimos per sol.  Germany  and the European Commission welcomed Greek
parliamentary approval for spending cuts, suggesting euro
finance chiefs will ratify a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion)
rescue package for the country Feb. 15.  “People are more willing to buy local-currency debt now
that a sudden and disorderly default” by Greece looks less
likely, said  Benito Berber , a strategist at Nomura Securities
Inc. in  New York . “Everything is looking very strong in
domestic and external markets.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6850 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6855 on Feb. 10.  The central bank didn’t  buy dollars  in the foreign exchange
market today, it said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
