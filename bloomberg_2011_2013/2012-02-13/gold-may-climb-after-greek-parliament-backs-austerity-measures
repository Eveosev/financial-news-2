Gold rose in  New York  as a weaker
dollar spurred demand for the metal as an alternative
investment.  The euro climbed against the dollar after Greek Prime
Minister  Lucas Papademos  won approval from parliament for
austerity measures needed to receive a second aid package.  Hedge
funds  and other money managers increased bets that U.S. futures
will gain by 8.6 percent in the week ended Feb. 7, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show.  “It’s the weakness in the dollar,” Bernard Sin, head of
currency and metal trading at bullion refiner MKS Finance SA in
Geneva, said today by phone. “It creates a bit of demand for
gold. On any dips, physical buying might come in and support the
market.”  Gold for April delivery advanced 0.5 percent to $1,733.50
an ounce by 7:59 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices fell 0.9
percent last week. Bullion for immediate delivery was 0.5
percent higher at $1,731.23 in  London .  The metal gained for an 11th consecutive year in 2011 as
investors sought to diversify from equities and some currencies.
Gold reached a record $1,923.70 in September, and holdings in
bullion-backed  exchange-traded products  are 0.2 percent below
December’s all-time high. Assets were little changed at 2,387.9
metric tons on Feb. 10, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Limited Uses  Still, investors should avoid gold because the metal’s uses
are limited and it lacks the potential of farmland or companies
to produce new wealth,  Warren Buffett , the billionaire chairman
of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said last week in an adaptation of
his annual letter to shareholders on Fortune magazine’s website.  Euro-area finance ministers will convene in Brussels Feb.
15 for an extraordinary meeting that was set after they declined
to ratify a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion) bailout package for
 Greece  in a special session on Feb. 9. Frustrated after two
years of missed budget targets, the European authorities
demanded Greek officials put verbal commitments into law and the
legislation was passed earlier today.  “Greece has passed the austerity measures, and investors
are now willing to send capital flow back into the euro,” said
 David Lennox , an analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney.  Silver for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to $33.855 an
ounce. It’s the best-performing precious metal this year, up 21
percent, and ETP holdings at 17,703.6 tons are the highest since
May, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Palladium, Platinum Rise  Palladium for March delivery advanced 0.1 percent to
$703.75 an ounce after reaching a four-month high of $718.65 on
Feb. 9. Assets held in ETPs, which came to 55.37 tons on Feb.
10, are up 6.8 percent this year, beating gains in other
precious-metals holdings.  Platinum for April delivery was up 0.5 percent at $1,667.80
an ounce after reaching a three-month high of $1,674 on Feb. 9.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  said it’s working with its
largest labor union to rehire dismissed employees and start
output at  South Africa ’s Rustenburg mine after it was closed by
an illegal strike. The stoppage is costing the market about
3,000 ounces of metal a day, according to Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc.  To contact the reporters for this story:
