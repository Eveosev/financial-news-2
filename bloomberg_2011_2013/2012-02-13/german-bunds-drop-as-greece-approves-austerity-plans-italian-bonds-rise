German bunds fell, pushing two-year
yields to the highest in two months, after Greek lawmakers
approved spending cuts demanded by European finance chiefs,
damping demand for safer assets.  Spanish 10-year bonds gained and Portuguese yields dropped
to an 11-week low as the Greek vote reduced the risk of
contagion to the region’s most-indebted nations. Euro-area
finance ministers plan to meet in two days to decide on a second
financial aid package for Greece. France, Germany and  Italy  sold
bills today.  Bunds “are drawing back a bit,” said Marius Daheim, a
senior fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in
Munich. “It is a better sentiment for peripherals on the back
of the Greek parliamentary vote yesterday. This is still a very
troublesome issue and at this point now I would still not say we
are out of the woods yet.”  The 10-year bund  yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.93 percent at 5 p.m. in London. The 2
percent bond due in January 2022 fell 0.215, or 2.15 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,320) face amount, to 100.61. The two-year yield
climbed two basis point to 0.26 percent after reaching 0.28
percent, the highest since Dec. 15.  A total of 199 Greek lawmakers voted in favor of the
austerity measures and 74 against, Parliament Speaker Filippos
Petsalnikos said in remarks carried live on state-run Vouli TV.
Passage of the bill puts the spotlight on the meeting of euro-
region finance ministers on Feb. 15 that must decide whether to
approve the second aid package.  Italian Bonds  Spanish  10-year  rates dropped four basis points to 5.26
percent, reducing the additional yield investors demand to hold
the securities instead of German debt by six basis points to
3.33 percentage points. Italian 10-year yields fell one basis
point to 5.6 percent.  “We’re seeing a bit of a logical reaction to at least the
slightly less risk, in the sense that the Greek parliament has
now approved the measures,” said Elwin de Groot, a market
economist at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht. “We’ve had quite a
big rally in Italian and Spanish bonds so the question there is
how much further can we see those spreads fall.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares rose 0.7 percent amid
renewed confidence in  Greece ’s ability to avoid economic
collapse. European finance ministers ended a meeting last week
with Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker saying aid wouldn’t be
forthcoming unless Greece turned budget cuts into law, provided
further details on 325 million euros in planned reductions and
had major party leaders sign up to the program so they don’t
retreat after elections.  ‘Will Be Saved’  Greece “will be saved in one way or another,” German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told newspaper Welt am
Sonntag yesterday.  Portuguese 10-year bond  yields  dropped 56 basis points to
11.93 percent, after dropping to 11.90 percent, the lowest level
since Nov. 24.  Volatility on Greek debt was the highest in euro-area
markets followed by  Portugal , according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  German sold 3.01 billion euros of six-month bills at an
average  yield  of 0.0761 percent, compared with minus 0.0122
percent at a sale on Jan. 9. The auction attracted bids for 1.51
times the securities allocated to investors, versus 1.82 times
last month.  Italian Notes  Italian borrowing costs fell at an auction of 12 billion
euros of bills. The Treasury sold 8.5 billion euros of 365-day
debt at an average yield of 2.23 percent, down from 2.735
percent at the previous auction on Jan. 12. The Treasury also
sold 3.5 billion euros of 127-day bills. The nation is scheduled
to auction 2014, 2015 and 2017 bonds tomorrow.  France  sold 8.7 billion euros of 84-, 175- and 357-day
debt. It plans to auction notes and inflation-linked bonds on
Feb. 16.  Swedish debt was the fourth-most volatile of European
securities. The nation is preparing to sell 1.5 billion euros of
three-year bonds via banks, according to a banker with knowledge
of the transaction. The move in the Swedish two- and 10-year
spread was 2.7 times the 90-day average change.  German bunds have handed investors a loss of 0.5 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
bonds gained 8.4 percent, and Spanish debt rose 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
