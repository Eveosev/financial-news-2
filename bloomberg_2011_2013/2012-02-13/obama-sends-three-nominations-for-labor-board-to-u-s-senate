President  Barack Obama  sent to the
Senate the nominations of three candidates he appointed last
month to the  National Labor Relations Board  amid a standoff with
Senate Republicans.  The nominations of Sharon Block, Terence Flynn and Richard Griffin, originally announced in December, were at the center of
a struggle between Obama and Senate Republicans, who accused the
president of exceeding his authority in using his recess
appointment power to seat them on the board. Sending the
nominations to the Senate is a procedural move.  The board started this year with two members, too few to
make decisions or issue rulings. The NLRB has been a Republican
target since it sued aerospace giant  Boeing Co. (BA)  in April for
opening a plant in the union-unfriendly state of South Carolina.
That case was settled in December.  Block, 46, is the Labor Departmentâ€™s deputy assistant
secretary for congressional affairs. From 2006 to 2009, she was
senior counsel for the Senate Health, Education, Labor and
Pensions Committee under the late Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts.  Griffin, 55, is general counsel for the International Union
of Operating Engineers and was on the board of the Lawyers
Coordinating Committee at the AFL-CIO since 1994. Flynn is
currently chief counsel to the one Republican member of the
labor board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
