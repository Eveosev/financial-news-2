Romania may interrupt exports of
electricity between Feb. 16 and March 15 to cover rising
domestic consumption because of freezing temperatures, according
to a  draft law  on the  Economy Ministry ’s website.  The Balkan nation, which faces a “heavy power deficit”
following a drought that kept river-water levels low and
increased heating demand, will start cutting power exports from
about 500 megawatts per hour, President Traian Basescu said
during a speech today.  “There will be no problem in supplying electricity to
citizens,” Basescu said. “If we will face problems we can
start cutting supplies to companies under a pre-established
plan.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
