German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government welcomed the decision of the Greek parliament to vote
in favor of further austerity measures.  “These decisions show the will and the readiness of the
Greeks to undertake major efforts of their own, including tough
cuts to put their country on a good path,” Steffen Seibert,
Merkel’s chief spokesman, told reporters in Berlin today.  “These are measures that, step by step, will restore the
country’s leeway for creating new jobs and new growth,” he
said. “These measures change the rigid structures of the  Greek
economy , the rigid structure of the Greek labor market so as to
unleash the productive forces. Greece’s European partners
welcome this; certainly Germany does.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
