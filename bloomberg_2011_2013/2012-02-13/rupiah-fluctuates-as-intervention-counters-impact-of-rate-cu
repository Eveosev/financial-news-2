Indonesia ’s rupiah swung between
gains and losses on speculation policy makers were in the market
to support the currency after an unexpected interest-rate cut
last week contributed to a two-day slide.  The central bank lowered its reference rate by 25 basis
points to 5.75 percent on Feb. 9, a move predicted by four of 15
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank Indonesia  has been
intervening in the currency and bond markets to curb volatility,
Governor Darmin Nasution said at a seminar in Jakarta Feb. 10.  “There was a lot of demand for dollars and that, along
with the rate cut, is putting pressure on the rupiah,” said
Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore .
“Intervention by the central bank in the currency and bonds
will continue.”  The rupiah, which opened 0.2 percent stronger and
subsequently fell as much as 0.2 percent, was little changed at
9,029 per dollar as of 8:51 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The  exchange rate  is relatively stable and won’t be much
affected by the rate cut, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Halim
Alamsyah said following the policy review.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 5.15 percent
last week, according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
