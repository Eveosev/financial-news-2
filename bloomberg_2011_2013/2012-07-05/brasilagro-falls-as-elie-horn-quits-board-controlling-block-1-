BrasilAgro - Companhia Brasileira de
Propriedades Agricolas  dropped the most in a week after the
Brazilian farmland developer said shareholder Elie Horn resigned
from the company’s board and will exit its controlling group.  Shares fell 1.4 percent to 7.55 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo . Trading volume surged more than 12-fold
from the average over the past three months. The benchmark
 Bovespa (IBOV)  index climbed 0.5 percent.  Horn, who also is chief executive officer at homebuilder
 Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes , is
leaving BrasilAgro “exclusively for personal reasons” and will
maintain his stake in the company, BrasilAgro said in a
regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
