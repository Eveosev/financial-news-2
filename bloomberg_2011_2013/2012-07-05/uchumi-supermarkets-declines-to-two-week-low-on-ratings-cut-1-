Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. (UCSP) ,  Kenya ’s
only publicly traded retailer, dropped the most in a week after
its recommendation was cut to hold from buy at Old Mutual
Securities Ltd, citing the stock’s rally this year.  The shares declined 0.6 percent to 15.95 shillings at the
close in Nairobi, the biggest retreat since June 29. The stock
has still more than doubled this year, the best performer on the
 Nairobi Securities Exchange All Share Index. (NSEASI)   “The price has already risen significantly,” Old Mutual
said yesterday in an e-mailed note to clients. “We expect
revenue to be strong but costs might be high as well due to the
opening of new branches during the year.”  Uchumi, which opened its first store in  Dar es Salaam ,
Tanzania’s commercial capital, in August and a second one in
 Uganda , plans to open another seven outlets in the region, three
in Uganda and four in Kenya, Managing Director Jonathan Ciano
said in September. Sales in the year through June may climb 34
percent, he said at the time.  Pretax profit for the six months through December climbed
26 percent to 204.3 million shillings ($2.39 million), Uchumi
said in January.  Uchumi resumed trading in Nairobi in May 2011, following a
five-year suspension, after most of its debts were cleared and
others were converted into shares, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
