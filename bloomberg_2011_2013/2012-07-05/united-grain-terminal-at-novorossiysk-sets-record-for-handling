United Grain Co.,  Russia ’s state
grain trader, said a terminal it controls at the port of
Novorossiysk handled a record amount of cereals in the season
that ran through last month.  Almost 3.8 million metric tons of grains passed through the
terminal in the period, the Moscow-based company said on its
website today. That exceeded United Grain’s previous record of
3.5 million tons, set in the 2008-09 season.  The terminal is one of two major cereal-handling facilities
at the Black Sea port. United Grain increased its capacity after
improvements during the 2010-11 season and said today it aims to
increase the site’s handling potential further to 5 million tons
a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
