Ireland has completed work on about
10 percent of its 2,066 unfinished housing projects, so-called
ghost estates, and while progress will become more obvious,
“patience” is required, according to an official report today.  Some 211 developments have been “effectively resolved,”
and 523 are being resolved through action by the developer or
bank appointed receivers, a report by Jan O’Sullivan, minister
of state for housing, said today. Another 636 sites are the
subject of legal enforcement proceedings.  “It is taking time to turn around the many developments,”
O’Sullivan said in the report. “Patience will be required.
There are complex legal, financial, procedural and construction
issues involved. More and more physical evidence of progress
will be visible in the year ahead.”  Ireland’s housing boom, which saw real estate prices
quadruple in the decade through 2007, has left the country with
a housing glut. Since 2007  home prices  have plunged 50 percent,
unemployment has almost tripled and the government has been
forced to rescue banks as loans to property developers soured.  Some 128 of the country’s ghost estates are in category 4,
which means they have been classed as abandoned by the developer
and have serious public safety issues, according to the report.
Of those sites, 29 are in the process of urgent remedial works
funded by the National Asset Management Agency, Ireland’s so-
called bad bank, the report said.  Last year the government made around 5 million euros ($6.2
million) available to local authorities to help complete works
on the sites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
