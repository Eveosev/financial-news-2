Kenya ’s shilling weakened the most in
more two weeks as the central bank cut its benchmark rate for
the first time in 18 months.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy weakened 0.7
percent to close at 84.55 per dollar, the biggest one-day
decline since June 12. The shilling has strengthened 2.5 percent
since May 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kenya’s central bank cut its  benchmark lending rate  for the
first time in 18 months to boost the economy as inflationary
pressures ease. The Monetary Policy Committee reduced the key
rate by 1.5 percentage points to 16.5 percent, according to an
e-mailed statement today from the Nairobi-based central bank.
Seven out of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a
one-percentage point cut, while one forecast a 50 basis points
reduction. The rest expected the rate to stay unchanged.  “The market expected a cut which points to the weakening
of the shilling,” Jeremiah Kendagor, the head of trading at
Nairobi-based  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said by phone after
the decision was announced “We will be keen to see how the
central bank will act to support the shilling if it slides
rapidly, either by enhancing its mop up exercise or even selling
dollars to meet demand and cushion the shilling.”  The central bank raised borrowing costs by a record 12.25
percentage points in 2011 to help bolster the shilling and curb
price pressures following drought. Inflation declined for the
seventh straight month to 10.1 percent from 12.2 percent in May,
the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-mailed
statement June 29.  Repurchase Agreements  Kenya sold 4 billion shillings ($47 million) of  repurchase
agreements  maturing in seven days at a weighted average rate of
16 percent, a central bank official, who asked not to be
identified in line with policy, said.  The central bank also accepted 1.8 billion shillings of bids
for 14-day term auction deposits at 16 percent, 400 million
shillings of 21-day TADS at 15.6 percent and 800 million
shillings in 28-day deposits at 15.85 percent, the official said
by telephone from Nairobi, the capital. The bank has been using
its open market operations to reduce the total  money supply .  Tanzania’s shilling weakened for the third time this week,
depreciating 0.4 percent to 1,587 per dollar.  Uganda ’s shilling
gained the most in almost two weeks, appreciating 0.3 percent,
the most since June 21, to 2,466.93 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
