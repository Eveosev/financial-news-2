Canadian natural gas rose to the
highest price in more than five months as a heat wave scorched
the U.S. mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions, signaling
increased demand for fuel to run air conditioners.  August gas in  Alberta  advanced 2.6 percent to the most
since Jan. 25 as states from Missouri to Delaware were expected
to have temperatures as much as 14 degrees Fahrenheit (8
Celsius) above normal through July 9, according to MDA EarthSat
Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland. U.S. inventories were 25
percent above the five-year average on June 22, down from a 60
percent surplus March 30.  “It’s warm outside; they’re still burning quite a bit of
natural gas in the electricity sector in particular,”  Kyle Cooper , director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston, said
in a telephone interview. “That storage overhang is being
reduced at a pretty rapid pace.”  Alberta gas for August delivery increased 5.75 cents to
C$2.2825 per gigajoule ($2.13 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:20 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Alberta gas has fallen 12 percent this year, from C$2.58 on
Dec. 31, and risen 40 percent from C$1.625 at the end of March.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  advanced 4.6 cents to settle at $2.945 per million Btu.  Record Breaker  The high in Washington, D.C., on July 7 may be 104 degrees,
15 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
Pennsylvania. That would break a record of 102 set in 2010.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago surged
13.11 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $3.0085 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 8.46 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $2.5393 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices advanced 10.58 cents, or 4 percent,
to $2.7497.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet at 3 p.m.  New York  time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.02 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was also 2.02 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 815 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.8 billion cubic feet today, or 69 percent of
normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.94
billion cubic feet at 2:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
