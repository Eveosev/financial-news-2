Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, the bankrupt law
firm that owes secured creditors more than $225 million, is
seeking to pay $450,000 in eight-week incentives, mostly to a
team of “wind down” specialists, according to a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court filing in Manhattan.  Separately, Dewey said it wanted to hire another firm to
liquidate its Frankfurt office. The U.S. trustee who supervises
bankruptcies has faulted Dewey for nine of about 11 proposed
hirings of firms, saying their work was unnecessary or
duplicative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
