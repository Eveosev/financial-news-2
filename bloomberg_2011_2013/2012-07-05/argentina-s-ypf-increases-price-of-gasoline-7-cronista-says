Argentine oil producer  YPF SA (YPFD)  raised
the price of gasoline by 7%, the first increase since the
government nationalized the company earlier this year, El
Cronista reported.  The increase, effective yesterday, took the price of super-
grade gasoline to 5.879 pesos ($1.30) per liter, the Buenos
Aires-based newspaper said, without explaining how it obtained
the information.  The measure follows gasoline price increases by  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , El Cronista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
