The ruble weakened for a second day
as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said downside
risks to the economy remained, outweighing monetary easing from
China and the U.K.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 32.5300 per
dollar by the close in Moscow. The ruble strengthened against
the euro, adding 0.6 percent to 40.3048, and was little changed
at 36.0287 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Draghi said “heightened uncertainty” was weighing on
confidence, pushing the ECB to cut  interest rates  to a record
low. The  Bank of England  restarted bond purchases two months
after halting its expansion of stimulus, and China cut benchmark
interest rates for the second time in a month.  Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.0545 per dollar
in three months, compared with investor expectations of 32.8390
per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
