U.K. police arrested five men and a
woman and raided eight homes throughout London as part of a
terrorism probe.  The six are being detained at a London police station on
suspicion of committing, preparing or instigating terrorist
acts, the  Metropolitan Police Service  said today in an e-mailed
statement. The arrests and searches aren’t linked to the
Olympics Games, scheduled to start this month.  The people range in age from 18 to 30. One, a 24-year-old
man, was shot with a Taser and didn’t need treatment. Officers
from the police firearms unit were also involved in the
operation, the MPS said.  One of the men served as a police community support officer
for two years until 2009, the MPS said in a separate statement.
He didn’t have a specialist role, they said.  In a separate incident, police closed a major highway in
central  England  to investigate a passenger on a bus headed to
 London . The investigation, which isn’t being treated as a
terrorism operation, led police to shut traffic on the M6, the
major highway linking central England with the country’s
northwest and  Scotland , Staffordshire police said.  Following an initial assessment, police determined there
was no danger to passengers and no one is being treated as a
suspect.  Sky News  initially reported the incident was part of a
counter-terrorism operation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
