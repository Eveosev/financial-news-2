Robert Walters Plc Chief Executive
Officer Robert Walters said the recruitment company is looking
for growth opportunities in  Brazil  and the Asia-Pacific region,
which he described as a “hot market.”  The London-based firm, which specializes in professional
recruitment worldwide, reported that net income fees fell by 3
percent to 47.6 million pounds ($74.1 million) in the second
quarter from 49.2 million pounds for the same period in 2011.
The company’s share price declined 5.86 percent to 196.75 pence
at 11.55 a.m. in London trading.  Walters said in an interview that the firm delivered a
stable performance against deteriorating worldwide market
conditions, with the Americas and  South Africa  the only areas
that saw growth in the second quarter, as net income there rose
4 percent to 1.6 million pounds from 1.5 million pounds in the
same period a year ago.  The company opened three new offices in  Milton
Keynes , north of London, Sydney and  Rio de Janeiro , and is
looking to open more in 2013.  “We’re sitting on a goldmine - the infrastructure, IT, and
marketing is in place. We have cash, no debt and a diversified
portfolio. I sleep well at night,” Walters said.  The company’s net cash fell to 4.5 million pounds as of
June. 30, from 10.7 million pounds in the same period in 2011
due to “growth of business contracts”, Walters said.
