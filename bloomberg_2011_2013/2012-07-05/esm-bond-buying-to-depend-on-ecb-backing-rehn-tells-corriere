The  European Central Bank  will need
to recommend that that the euro region’s rescue fund buys a
country’s bonds before securities can be purchased, European
Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  told
the newspaper  Corriere della Sera .  Once a country requests that the fund buys its bonds to try
to bring down borrowing costs, granting permission “will depend
on the analysis of the recommendations of the ECB and other
conditions,” Rehn told the Italian newspaper in an interview.  Rehn didn’t indicate what the other conditions would be.
The final decision will require a unanimous decision of all the
17 euro-region governments unless there is a threat to the
stability of the currency area, in which case a “qualified
majority” will decide, Rehn told Corriere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
