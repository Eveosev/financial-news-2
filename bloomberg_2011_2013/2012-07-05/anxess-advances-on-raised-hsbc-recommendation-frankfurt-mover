Lanxess AG (LXS) , the German maker of
synthetic rubber for Pirelli & C SpA tires, rose to the highest
level in five weeks after HSBC Holdings Plc raised its
recommendation on the shares to overweight from neutral.  The stock advanced as much as 2.5 percent to 54.84 euros,
the highest intraday level since May 30, and was up 1.4 percent
at 54.25 euros as of 1:41 p.m. Laxness has risen for five days,
its longest streak of gains since January. The stock has climbed
9.1 percent this week, compared with a 2.8 percent advance for
the STOXX 600 Chemicals Index.  Jesko Mayer-Wegelin, an analyst at HSBC, set a target price
of 64 euros a share. The company will benefit from “increasing
divergence” between standard and high-performance tire demand,
according to HSBC.  Of 33  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg, 26 recommend buying
Lanxess shares and seven recommend holding the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
