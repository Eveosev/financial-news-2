U.S. stocks declined, halting a
three-day advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, amid
disappointment over  Europe ’s efforts to tame the region’s debt
crisis as investors awaited tomorrow’s American jobs report.  Financial (S5FINL)  shares had the biggest loss among 10 groups in
the S&P 500 as Spanish and Italian bonds plunged.  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  retreated at least 3 percent.
Retailers in the benchmark measure rose 1 percent amid June
sales data.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the world’s most valuable company,
advanced 1.8 percent to pace gains in technology companies.  The S&P 500 decreased 0.5 percent to 1,367.58 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 47.15 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 12,896.67. Volume for exchange-listed stocks
in the U.S. was 5.3 billion shares, 21 percent below the three-
month average. The market was closed yesterday for a holiday.  “There’s a bit of disappointment with the ECB,” said  Mike Ryan , the New York-based chief investment strategist at UBS
Wealth Management Americas. “Meantime, people are not willing
to take big bets going into the jobs report tomorrow.”  Equities fell as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said today’s cut in  interest rates  to a record low may
have only a limited impact on the euro-area economy. China also
reduced rates in a bid to spur growth. Tomorrow’s Labor
Department data may show the pace of hiring in the U.S.
accelerated in June while remaining at less than half the
average for the first quarter of the year, economists said.  Today’s economic reports showed that fewer Americans filed
jobless claims and hiring beat estimates.  Service industries 
expanded at a slower pace, underscoring Federal Reserve concern
that growth isn’t strong enough to reduce unemployment.  Equity Rout  The last jobs report spurred a rout in stocks, erasing the
2012 gain in the Dow and putting the  S&P 500  on the brink of a
so-called correction, or a 10 percent decline from a recent
peak. The benchmark gauge tumbled 2.5 percent on June 1 after
data showed employers added the fewest workers in a year and the
 unemployment rate  rose. Since then, the S&P 500 has risen 7
percent amid bets on global central bank action.  Eight out of  10 groups  in the S&P 500 retreated today as
financial and energy shares dropped at least 1.3 percent. The
Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to economic
growth closed almost unchanged after  slumping  as much as 0.9
percent and gaining 0.5 percent earlier today.  Twenty three out of 24 stocks in the  KBW Bank Index (BKX) 
declined. JPMorgan Chase & Co. slumped 4.2 percent, the most in
the Dow, to $34.38. The lender was ordered by a federal judge to
explain why it shouldn’t be compelled to turn over e-mails
sought by U.S. regulators in a probe of potential energy-market
manipulation. Bank of America slid 3 percent to $7.82.  Apple Rallies  Technology shares, which comprise 20 percent of the S&P
500, reversed an earlier decline. Apple climbed 1.8 percent to
$609.94, the highest since April 25.  Consumer companies in the S&P 500 rallied. U.S. retailers’
June same-store sales about matched analysts’ estimates, with
luxury chains such as  Saks Inc. (SKS)  and discounters like  TJX Cos. (TJX) 
topping expectations. Stores targeting middle-income consumers
trailed projections.  “The high-end consumer has fared particularly well
throughout this recovery,”  Ken Perkins , president of
Swampscott, Massachusetts-based Retail Metrics, said in an
interview. “On the low end, a lot of middle-income consumers
have traded down.”  TJX, which owns discount stores T.J. Maxx and Marshalls,
rose 3.7 percent to $44.09.  Limited Brands Inc. (LTD) , the parent
company of Victoria’s Secret, jumped 4.5 percent to $46.12,
while Saks gained 2.5 percent to $11.19. Sales at  Target Corp. (TGT) 
rose 2.1 percent, falling short of the average projection. The
shares dropped 1.1 percent to $57.15.  Chinese Companies  Chinese stocks  traded in the U.S. gained as  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , the
nation’s largest online search engine, rose to a two-week high
after policy makers cut interest rates for a second time in a
month to bolster growth.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. rose 0.8 percent to 92.49, the
highest level since June 20. Baidu advanced 2.2 percent to
$117.21.  Sina Corp. (SINA) , operator of the Twitter-like Weibo service,
rallied 1.4 percent to $51.21.  “The Chinese authorities are trying to help stem the
slowdown in global growth, and that’s a good thing,” said
Audrey Kaplan, who helps manage $2 billion as head of
international equities at Federated Global Investment Management
in New York. “We see this as a great entry point for Chinese
stocks.”  Netflix Soars  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  soared 13 percent, the most since January, to
$81.72. The largest video-subscription service also had the
biggest gain in the  S&P 500 (SPX)  after an analyst said the company’s
online audience exceeds cable and TV networks.  Yelp Inc. (YELP)  surged 5.8 percent to $26.16 amid speculation
that a smaller model of Apple’s iPad could help the business-
review service add users. Apple plans to debut a smaller,
cheaper iPad by the end of the year, people familiar with the
matter said earlier this week.  Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX)  climbed 23 percent to $2.26 on
speculation it may be near a deal to refinance its debt. The
shares have jumped 85 percent in three days, the most since it
was spun off from Peabody Energy Corp. in October 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
