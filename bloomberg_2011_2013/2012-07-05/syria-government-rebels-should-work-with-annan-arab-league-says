Syria ’s government and opposition
should work with United Nations envoy  Kofi Annan  to resolve the
conflict in their country, Deputy Secretary-General of the Arab
League Ahmad Bin Heli said.  Annan’s six-point plan is a road map to end the 16-month-
long conflict, Heli told a press conference in Cairo broadcast
by Al Jazeera television. “Everyone realizes that betting on
the military option is not the right solution,” Heli said.  The government of President Bashar al-Assad is fighting a
growing insurrection in which more than 10,000 people have died,
according to UN estimates. At least 114 people were killed in
Syria yesterday and a further 28 today, the Local Coordination
Committees in Syria said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
