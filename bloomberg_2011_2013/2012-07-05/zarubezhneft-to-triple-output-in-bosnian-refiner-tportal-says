OAO Zarubezhneft (ZRNFT) , a Russian  oil
company , plans to triple output in its Bosnian plant  Rafinerija
Nafte AD Bosanski Brod (RNAFRA)  to three million tons of oil a year by
2016, after investing 760 million euros ($950 million) over the
next four years,  TPortal  reported today, citing Alexander
Gribok, the refinery’s technical director.  The Moscow-based company is also “a step closer” in
bidding to buy filling stations from  OMV AG (OMV)  in Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Zagreb-based electronic newspaper said,
citing Josip Pleslic, the company’s representative in Croatia.  OMV of  Austria  is selling subsidiaries in Croatia and
Bosnia as central Europe’s biggest oil company focuses on
exploration and production, it said on Dec. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
