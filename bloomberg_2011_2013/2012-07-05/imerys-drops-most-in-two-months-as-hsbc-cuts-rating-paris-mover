Imerys SA (NK) , a French maker of building
materials and paper pigments, fell the most in two months as
HSBC cut its recommendation on the stock to underweight because
of the drop in France’s housing market.  The stock  declined  as much as 7.4 percent, the most since
May 4, in Paris, where the company is based. The shares were
down 3.9 percent to 39.42 euros at 11:08 a.m. They have risen 11
percent this year.  French  housing starts  in the March-May period dropped 19
percent to 81,271, partly hurt by the phasing out of a tax
break, government figures showed last month. An index of
executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
dropped in June to the lowest in more than 2 1/2 years as
concerns about the region’s sovereign debt crisis increased, the
European Commission said June 28.  France ’s drop in housing starts is “a lead indicator for
Imerys’ building materials output in 12 months’ time,” HSBC
said in a research note today. The bank cut its target price for
Imerys to 40 euros from 44 euros. “We expect trading conditions
to be weaker in the second quarter 2012 for Imerys as industrial
production is slowing down in  Europe .”  First-quarter sales rose 10 percent to 974.4 million euros
($1.22 billion), and operating profit excluding expenses climbed
to 126.8 million euros, Imerys said April 26.  “Housing sales is one of the many leading indicators for
Imerys, France’s leader for clay tiles and bricks,” said Eric Lemarie, an analyst at Aurel BGC in Paris, in a note today. He
maintained a sell recommendation on the stock. “It’s not good
for Imerys’s stock price, even though its exposure to France’s
new homes is limited to about 6 percent of its revenue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
