Gasoline futures surged to a five-
week high as  Brent crude  gained when Norway’s largest oil
producer said a strike forced a production halt and as U.S.
motor fuel demand climbed last week before the July 4 holiday.  Futures gained as much as 2.6 percent as a stronger Brent
may raise the cost of European fuel imports. The Energy
Department reported that gasoline  demand , measured by deliveries
to wholesalers, rose 1.8 percent to 9 million barrels a day.
 Total fuel demand  increased 2.8 percent to the highest since
Nov. 4.  “Brent is being supported by the Norwegian strike and its
potential to shut in all the output out of that country,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“And it’s anticipated there was a huge amount of driving over
the July 4 holiday and that would increase demand.”  August-delivery gasoline advanced 4.86 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.7715 a gallon at 12:57 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Gasoline touched $2.795, the highest level since May 31,
after department data showed that East Coast stockpiles fell to
a seven-month low, followed by a report that a compressor failed
at a Delaware refinery serving the  New York  Harbor market. The
premium of August over September futures jumped to 11.21 cents a
gallon from 9.26 cents July 3.  “That could help support prices,” said  David Pursell , a
managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in Houston.  Total U.S. gasoline  supplies  rose 151,000 barrels to 205
million as refiners increased  output  of the motor fuel 1.2
percent to 9.39 million barrels a day.  Crack Spread  Gasoline’s premium to WTI, or crack spread, based on August
contracts, widened $2.48 to $29.18 a barrel on the Nymex. The
spread touched $29.53, the widest gap since June 18.  “Tightness on the East Coast last week points to a
strength in the gasoline market,” said  Sander Cohan , a global
transportation fuels analyst and principal with Energy Security
Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  Norwegian oil producers led by  Statoil ASA (STL)  plan to shut all
offshore operations as  Europe ’s second-largest crude exporter
seeks to resolve an 11-day strike over pensions. As much as 2
million barrels a day of oil equivalent may be lost if a planned
lockout goes ahead on July 9, Statoil said.  Brent oil for August settlement rose $1.29 to $101.06 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark’s premium to the U.S. benchmark, West Texas
Intermediate, increased to $13.89 from $13.02 July 3.  Brent-WTI Spread  “The Brent-WTI spread widening out is providing support
for products,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Heating oil for August delivery rose 1.58 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.7743 a gallon on the exchange.  Distillate  inventories  fell 1.05 million barrels to 117.8
million. Demand rose 0.6 percent to an average 3.85 million
barrels a day. Crude oil stockpiles fell 4.27 million barrels to
382.9 million in the largest decline this year.  “I don’t like gasoline not drawing and gasoline demand is
still pretty weak, but this report is bullish just because of
the big crude draw and distillate draw,” Pursell said.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 0.2 cent to $3.338 a gallon yesterday, according to
AAA. Prices are down 15 percent from a year-to-date high of
$3.936 on April 4 and 6.3 percent below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
