The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
increased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia  index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 2 basis points to 164.5 basis
points as of 8:45 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The benchmark, which has ranged between
210 and 132.5 this year, is set to rise for the first time in
eight days, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia  index  increased 3 basis points
to 170 as of 10:20 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices
show. The measure reached a high for the year of 211 basis
points on June 4, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan  index  rose 3 basis points to 170
basis points as of 9:45 a.m. in  Tokyo , RBS prices show. The
gauge fell to 168.5 yesterday, its lowest since April 12, CMA
data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
