Russian  consumers  were more
optimistic in the second quarter than at any time in almost four
years as people reported improvements in the country’s economy
and their own finances.  The  consumer confidence  index rose 1 point to minus 4, the
highest since the third quarter of 2008, when the measure peaked
at plus 1, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Consumer spending , which accounts for half of  Russia ’s
gross domestic product, helped protect growth in the world’s
biggest energy exporter as the global economic turmoil sapped
demand abroad. Surging wages and retail lending, coupled with a
drop in unemployment to 5.4 percent, creates a risk of
overheating, according to VTB Capital.  “The strong performance from fixed capital investments and
household consumption might prove unsustainable later this year
due to tighter monetary policy and the lower confidence of
economic agents,” Maxim Oreshkin and Daria Isakova, analysts at
VTB in Moscow, said in a note before the release.  An index of consumers’ outlook for the economy was
unchanged in the second quarter at 4, while a measure of
perceptions that had already occurred rose two points to minus
1, the service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
