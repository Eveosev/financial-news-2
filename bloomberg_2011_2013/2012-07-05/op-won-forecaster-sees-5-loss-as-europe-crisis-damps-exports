South  Korea ’s won will post its worst
quarter in a year as  Europe ’s financial crisis saps demand for
exports, according to Credit Suisse Group AG, the top forecaster.  The currency will fall 5.4 percent to 1,200 per dollar in
three months, the weakest level since October,  Ray Farris , the
Singapore-based head of  Asia  Pacific fixed-income strategy, said
in a July 4 interview. The second-largest Swiss bank had the
closest estimates in the last six quarters as measured by
Bloomberg Rankings. The projection is more bearish than the
1,170 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 27 analysts.  Slowing growth in the euro area has prompted the South
Korean government to cut forecasts for gross domestic product in
2012 and those for exports, which contribute about 50 percent to
the $1 trillion economy. A 3.2 percent rally in the won over the
past month will fade as  risk aversion  once again becomes the
dominant theme for Asian markets, according to Sydney-based
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , the second-best forecaster.  “Most indicators point to weaker Asian export growth, and
with domestic demand extremely weak in South Korea, slower
exports will have a disproportionately negative impact on the
economy,” Farris said. “We still have concerns about the euro
area, predominantly from a growth perspective.”  Europe Measures Limited  The won has appreciated 0.6 percent to 1,138.59 per dollar
since June 29, when European leaders reached an agreement on
measures to resolve its two-year-old debt crisis, which has
shaved $3.9 trillion from global stock  markets  since touching
the year’s high in March.  Officials overseeing the 17 nations sharing the single
European currency agreed to spend 120 billion euros ($150
billion) to stimulate economic growth and dropped conditions on
emergency loans to Spanish banks at the conclusion of a June 28-
29 summit in Brussels.  The measures will do little to improve prospects for global
growth, Farris said.  Westpac Banking  predicts the currency will
depreciate 2.4 percent to 1,166 per dollar by year-end, compared
with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 1,146.  South Korea’s government cut its 2012 estimate for export
growth to 3.5 percent this month from a January projection of
6.7 percent, citing a slowdown in major economies. It expects
the value of overseas shipments to reach $574.5 billion,
compared with a previous prediction of $595 billion. The  finance
ministry  lowered its economic expansion forecast to 3.3 percent
in June from 3.7 percent previously.  Exports have dropped every month bar two this year, and
rebounded 1.3 percent in June after contracting 0.6 percent in
May, official data show.  HSBC Won Bullish  HSBC Holdings Plc is more upbeat on the won, saying the
trade and current-account balances are supportive. The won has
strengthened 1.2 percent this year, the fourth-best performance
among Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies.  The won will appreciate 1.7 percent to 1,120 by Dec. 31,
Perry Kojodjojo, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Europe’s
largest bank and the third-most accurate forecaster for the
currency, said in a July 3 phone interview.  The current-account surplus, the broadest measure of trade,
increased to a six-month high of $3.61 billion in May, while the
 trade surplus  reached $4.96 billion in June, the most since
October 2010.  “Fundamentally, South Korea is still one of the stronger
Asian countries,” Kojodjojo said. “Our economists expect Korea
to raise  interest rates  early next year, one of the few Asian
central banks to do so.”  The  Bank of Korea  held the seven-day repurchase  rate  at
3.25 percent for a 12th month at the last meeting on June 8.  Default Swaps  South Korea’s government bonds are rallying and the cost to
protect the nation’s debt from default is falling.  The yield on 3.25 percent notes maturing in June 2015
dropped 33 basis points, or 0.33 percentage point, to 3.29
percent from the year’s high of 3.64 percent touched on March 23,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Five-year credit-default swaps fell seven basis points this
week to 116 basis points, according to data provider CMA, which
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a government or
company fails to adhere to its debt agreements.  One-month implied volatility in the won, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, has dropped 638
basis points to 7.17 percent in  Seoul  from a 2012 high of 13.55
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Year-End Rebound  Huw McKay , a senior international economist for Westpac
Banking, said the won may weaken to near 1,200 in the next few
months before rebounding toward year-end.  Forecasters were ranked according to the accuracy of their
estimates in each of six quarters beginning with the three
months ended March 31, 2011. To test long-term accuracy,
Bloomberg added one annual forecast made on June 30, 2011 for
June 30, 2012. The average margin for error was 3.03 percent for
Credit Suisse’s won forecasts, 4.57 percent for Westpac Banking,
and 4.65 percent for HSBC Holdings.  The  International Monetary Fund  estimated in April euro-
area economies will contract 0.3 percent this year, while  China 
will expand 8.2 percent. Europe’s GDP increased 1.5 percent in
2011, while China’s grew 9.2 percent.  “We’re very negative on all risk assets for the next few
months,” McKay said in a July 4 interview.  Manufacturing in China,  South Korea ’s biggest export market,
fell to a seven-month low in June. A purchasing managers’ index
dropped to 48.2 from 48.4 in May, HSBC Holdings and Markit
Economics reported on July 2.  “We don’t have any indications that weakness in the global
economy is bottoming, but we tend to think we’ll see a bottom
late in the third quarter or early in the fourth,” Farris at
Credit Suisse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
