Romania plans to sell a minority
stake in natural-gas producer Romgaz SA this “autumn” and will
wait for political turmoil to ease “soon” before selling
another stake in its  Transgaz SA (TGN)  utility, Bursa reported, citing
an economy ministry official.  The Romanian energy-market regulator and a commission are
working to set up regulated gas-transport tariffs by the time a
schedule for the sale of a 15 percent stake in Transgaz is
released, Remus Vulpescu, the head of the industry privatization
office, told the Bucharest-based newspaper. This would enable
the natural-gas grid operator to forecast its revenue for the
next four years, Bursa said.  An auction to select lead managers for the sale of a
minority stake in nuclear-power plant operator Nuclearelectrica
SA will be resumed “soon,” Vulpescu said, according to Bursa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
