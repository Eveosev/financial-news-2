New Zealand  Prime Minister John Key
said  China  may eventually surpass  Australia  as his country’s
biggest export market as Asia’s economies drive growth while
Europe struggles.  New Zealand’s free-trade agreement with China has been
“hugely successful” since it was signed in 2008, Key said in
response to a question after a speech in Sydney today. “We see
huge opportunities in China, we think it’s worked really well
for us.”  New Zealand’s exports to China are growing four times
faster than its shipments to Australia. Sales to Australia rose
1.2 percent to NZ$10.4 billion ($8.4 billion) in the 12 months
through May from the year-earlier period, compared with a 4.8
percent gain in exports to China totaling NZ$5.9 billion in the
year through May, according to government figures.  Key said New Zealand wants to boost exploration in mining
and oil and gas, adding it was envious of Australia’s drive to
increase extraction, describing its rival across the Tasman Sea
as “fundamentally a giant mine.” Oil is New Zealand’s fourth-
largest export, he said.  Key said a lot of New Zealand’s natural resources are
protected in national parks.  “We think there’s tremendous opportunities in terms of oil
and gas,” he told the Trans-Tasman Business Circle. “We do
have to balance our environmental responsibilities with our
economic opportunities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
