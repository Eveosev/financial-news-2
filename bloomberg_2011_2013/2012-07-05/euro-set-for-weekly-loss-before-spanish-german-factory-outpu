The euro weakened for a third day
against the yen after a slide in Spanish industrial production
added to concern the region’s debt crisis will worsen as
economic growth stalls.  The 17-nation currency headed for its biggest weekly
decline versus the dollar in six months as Spanish bonds
slumped, pushing 10-year yields to 7 percent. The euro extended
losses from yesterday when the  European Central Bank  cut its
benchmark rate to a record. Australia’s dollar and South
Africa’s rand dropped as stock losses damped demand for higher-
yielding assets. The dollar was little changed before a U.S.
report forecast to show the nation is struggling to add jobs.  “The euro is down because we have seen rates crushed this
week and they are going to stay low for a long time,” said  Paul Robson , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in  London . “The U.S. payroll number will
give quite a lot of guidance about market expectations about
quantitative easing,” or bond purchases, he said.  The euro fell 0.1 percent 98.89 yen at 7:09 a.m. in  New
York  after dropping 1 percent yesterday. The 17-nation
currency weakened 0.1 percent to $1.2380, having depreciated
2.3 percent this week, the most since the period ended Dec.
16. The yen was little changed at 79.87 per dollar.  Spain Recession  Spanish industrial production adjusted for the number of
working days fell 6.1 percent in May from a year earlier, after
an 8.3 percent decline in April, the National Statistics
Institute said in  Madrid . Spain’s recession probably intensified
in the second quarter as  Europe ’s debt crisis worsened, the
central bank said on June 27.  The Spanish  10-year yield  rose as much as 26 basis points,
or 0.26 percentage point, to 7.04 percent after jumping 37 basis
points yesterday. Italy’s 10-year yield increased six basis
points to 6.04 percent.  “Downside risks to the euro-area economic outlook have
materialized,” ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday after
cutting the main refinancing rate by a quarter-percentage point
to a record 0.75 percent and reducing interest on overnight
deposits to zero.  The euro has slumped 7.5 percent in the past year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar gained 8.3 percent,
and the yen advanced 8 percent.  ‘Look Dire’  “The economic fundamentals surrounding the euro area look
dire,” said Takuya Kawabata, researcher at Gaitame.com Research
Institute Ltd. in  Tokyo , a unit of  Japan ’s largest currency-
margin company. “We can’t expect any economic indicators that
can bolster the euro.”  U.S. employers hired 100,000 workers last month after
adding 69,000 in May, the least in a year, according to the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Company headcounts excluding government agencies may have
climbed by 106,000, concluding the smallest quarterly advance
since the first three months of 2010.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which the Intercontinental Exchange Inc.
uses to track the greenback against the currencies of six major
U.S. trading partners, was little changed at 82.873. The gauge
climbed to 82.950 yesterday, the highest since June 4.  South Africa’s rand declined for a third day, sliding 0.9
percent to 8.2186 per dollar, and the so-called Aussie dropped
0.3 percent to $1.0257.  The Swiss central bank’s foreign-currency reserves rose to
a record in June as euro-region’s turmoil spurred policy makers
to step up their defense of the franc floor.  Currency holdings jumped to 364.9 billion Swiss francs
($376 billion) at the end of June from 305.9 billion francs the
prior month, according to a statement published on the  Swiss
National Bank ’s website today.  The franc was little changed at 1.2011 per euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
