stockpiles for last week because of hot weather.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gas futures for August
delivery rose 1.6 percent to $2.945 per million British thermal
units, the highest settlement since Jan. 9.  U.K. gas rose as Statoil ASA said it is preparing to shut

striking workers.  Gas for next week climbed 1 pence, or 1.7 percent, to 58.5
pence a therm at 4:07 p.m. London time. August gas gained 1.2
percent to 57.45 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $8.92 per

percent to $2.7648 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for August delivery climbed 0.4 percent
to $2.7684 a gallon.  BASE METALS  Copper futures dropped the most in two weeks after the U.S.
added more workers than forecast in June, easing concern that
the labor market is deteriorating and reducing pressure on the
 Federal Reserve  to loosen U.S. monetary policies.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for September
delivery slid 1.3 percent to $3.493 a pound, the biggest fall
since June 21.  Copper for delivery in three months slipped 0.4 percent to

Exchange.  Nickel, aluminum, tin, zinc and lead also declined on the

decline since June 25.  Cattle futures for August delivery slipped 0.3 percent to
