The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Mexico City trading. Stock symbols are
in parentheses, and prices are as of 10:53 a.m. local time.  The IPC index fell 0.6 percent to 40,118.75.  Sare Holding SAB (SAREB)  , a Mexican homebuilder, surged
11 percent to 1.64 pesos, the most on the IRT Small
Capitalization index. Beamonte Investments Inc. plans to make a
bid to buy Sare as soon as July 18, Luis Trevino, managing
director for Latin America at the Boston-based private equity
company, said in a telephone interview yesterday.  America Movil SAB (AMXL)   fell 1 percent to 17.38 pesos,
after earlier dropping as much as 2.1 percent in the steepest
intraday decline since June 1. The companyâ€™s Telmex unit may
have to wait until 2014 for a legal decision on its request for
a license to offer pay-television service in Mexico, the
newspaper Reforma said, citing a lawyer specializing in
telecommunications.  Pochteca SAB (POCHTECB)  , the Mexico City-based
distributor of industrial greases and solvents, climbed 8.4
percent to 2.59 pesos. Antonio del Valle, who invested in a 300
million peso capital increase for the company in April, said the
company would pursue acquisition-driven growth in a June 21
telephone interview from Mexico City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
