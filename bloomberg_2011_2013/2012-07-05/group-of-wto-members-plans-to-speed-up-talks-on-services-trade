Nineteen World Trade Organization
governments exploring a global agreement on trade in services
agreed to step up discussions as of September with a goal of
beginning formal negotiations by the end of the year.  Following exploratory talks into ways to promote the
liberalization of services trade, governments including the
U.S., the European Union,  Australia  and  Peru  said in a joint
statement that they will now aim to define the contours of an
“ambitious agreement.” Three of the world’s fastest-growing
emerging economies, Brazil,  China  and  India , aren’t involved in
the discussions.  “This reflects the EU’s goal to re-energize services trade
liberalization in a manner that is both consistent with and
complementary to the WTO,” EU Ambassador Angelos Pangratis said
in a statement from Geneva today. “The initiative follows the
guidance of ministers given at the eighth ministerial conference
to fully explore ‘different negotiating approaches’ to areas
under discussion in the Doha Development Agenda.”  The group of governments plans to broaden the discussions
to include other countries, particularly developing economies.
Any accord should be comprehensive and include market-access
commitments that correspond with actual practice, they said in a
joint statement, adding that “the outcomes of the agreement
could then be brought into the multilateral system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
