Chang Jian, an economist with
 Barclays Capital  in  Hong Kong , comments on China’s second
interest-rate cut in a month.  The People’s Bank of China said today the one-year lending
rate will fall by 31 basis points and the one-year deposit rate
will drop by 25 basis points effective tomorrow. Banks can offer
loans of as much as 30 percent less than benchmark rates, the
central bank said on its website.  “Policy makers have underestimated the weakness of
sentiment and economic activities on the ground.”  “Two rate cuts in a month suggest very likely the second-
quarter GDP data and June activities have surprised to the
downside.”  “Rising external headwinds and rapid falling inflation
have also helped to justify the move.”  Chang said Barclays is forecasting second-quarter gross
domestic product growth of 7.5 percent, compared with the
consensus forecast of 7.8 percent. Barclays sees June inflation
at 2.1 percent, compared with consensus estimates of 2.3
percent, according to the economist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
