The euro sank to a one-month low as
Spanish and Italian bonds plunged, while stocks retreated, after
the  European Central Bank  disappointed investors anticipating a
more aggressive effort to fight the debt crisis.  The euro tumbled 1.1 percent to $1.2390 at 4 p.m. in New
York and the  Dollar Index  surged the most this year. Ten-year
Spanish and Italian bond yields increased at least 21 basis
points. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.5 percent after
slumping 0.8 percent earlier. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities
rose 0.4 percent as crops rallied. Ten-year Treasury note rates
slipped three basis points to 1.60 percent as trading resumed
following the Independence Day holiday.  ECB policy makers refrained from announcing more measures
to cap borrowing costs in Italy and Spain. Some “downside risks
to the euro-area economic outlook have materialized,” the
central bank’s president,  Mario Draghi , said after policy makers
lowered the main refinancing rate and the deposit rate by 25
basis points to 0.75 percent and zero respectively. In the U.S.,
a gauge of service-industry growth trailed forecasts, while data
on employment showed improvement.  “There’s still a lot of uncertainty for peripheral bonds
and Draghi made that clear today,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of
European rate strategy at Societe Generale SA in Paris.
“Draghi’s comments illustrate that the economic outlook has
worsened and that details of last week’s summit accord still
need to be worked out between sovereigns.”  Euro Weakens  The euro weakened against 14 of 16 major peers, with eight
counterparts gaining more than 1 percent, including the
Brazilian real, Australian and Singapore dollars. The  U.S.
dollar  strengthened against 10 of 16 peers. The Dollar Index, a
gauge of the currency against six major counterparts, jumped
almost 1.3 percent for its biggest advance of 2012.  European stocks,  S&P 500  futures and commodities rallied
earlier after China cut its benchmark deposit rate by 25 basis
points and lending rate 31 basis points, and the  Bank of England 
restarted bond purchases. Equities also climbed earlier as
companies in the U.S. added 176,000 workers in June, according
to figures from ADP Employer Services, topping economists’
estimates for 100,000 jobs. American unemployment claims fell
more than forecast to 374,000 last week, a government report
showed.  U.S. Labor Department data tomorrow is forecast to show
that 100,000 jobs were added to American payrolls in June,
according to the median forecast of economists. The 69,000
increase in jobs in May, reported on June 1, was the weakest
growth in a year. The S&P 500 tumbled 2.5 percent to a five-
month low that day and 10-year Treasury yields set a record low
of 1.4387 percent. The S&P 500 has rebounded 7 percent since.  Two-Month High  The S&P 500 retreated today after closing at a two-month
high on July 3. Financial and energy shares led losses among the
10 main industry groups in the index, with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  falling more than 1.2
percent to lead declines in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Limited Brands Inc. and  Ross Stores Inc. (ROST)  rose more than 4.4
percent to lead a rally in retailers after reporting June sales
that topped estimates.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, fell to 52.1 in June from the prior month’s 53.7.  Among commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI Index, wheat,
corn and soybeans surged more than 3.5 percent to lead gains as
hot dry weather continued to threaten production in the U.S.
Zinc, cotton and silver lost at least 2.1 percent for the
biggest declines.  The Stoxx 600 is on course for a fifth week of gains, the
longest winning streak since January, and has rebounded more
than 9 percent from its low for the year on June 4.  Volkswagen, Porsche  Banks led declines in  Europe  today, with Spain’s Banco
Santander SA plunging 3.9 percent and  Italy ’s UniCredit SpA
losing 5.1 percent.  Volkswagen AG jumped 5.1 percent after reaching an
agreement with Germany’s tax authorities to buy the 50.1 percent
stake in Porsche SE that it doesn’t already own. GKN Plc surged
13 percent as the U.K. maker of parts for Airbus SAS jetliners
agreed to buy the aircraft-engine unit of Volvo AB for 633
million pounds ($987 million).  Spain’s 10-year bond yield climbed 37 basis points to 6.78
percent, the highest since June 29. The country sold 10-year
securities at an average yield of 6.43 percent today, compared
with 6.044 percent at a sale in June. It also sold debt maturing
in 2015 and 2016. Italy’s 10-year rate climbed 21 basis points
to 5.98 percent.  The yield on the 10-year U.K. gilt fell seven basis points
to 1.66 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee raised its asset-
purchase target by 50 billion pounds ($78 billion) to 375
billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
