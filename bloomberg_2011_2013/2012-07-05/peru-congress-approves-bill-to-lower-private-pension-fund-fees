Peru ’s congress approved a bill
designed to increase competition among private pension funds and
reduce their fees.  The standing committee of Peru’s unicameral legislature
voted 11-10 in favor of the bill late yesterday, congress said
in an e-mailed statement. The bill now needs to be signed into
law by President Ollanta Humala.  The legislation, which the government presented to congress
a month ago, seeks to boost the number of pension fund managers,
known as AFPS, from the current four and entice more people to
take out private retirement plans. Providers will move from
salary-based commissions to a system of fees based on the size
of the workers’ pension savings while new customers will be
obliged to join the AFP offering the lowest fees via an auction
system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
