The surplus of tankers available to
haul European gasoline across the Atlantic Ocean is set to
remain at the highest in at least a year as U.S. demand slows, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  As many as 63 Medium Range vessels may be available for the
voyage over the coming two weeks to July 18, the median estimate
of six shipbrokers, traders and owners who specialize in
transporting gasoline showed today.  Demand to charter ships to haul road fuel cargoes across
the Atlantic to the U.S. is expected to remain slow, the
consulting arm of Oslo-based shipping-services company Astrup
Fearnley said in an e-mailed report today. Tankers carrying
gasoline on the benchmark Rotterdam-to-New York trade route are
earning $1,068 a day, according to the London-based Baltic
Exchange. That’s compared with returns of $20,899 a day at the
start of the year, according to exchange data.  “There does not seem to be any light in the tunnel in the
weeks ahead for vessels trading on the continent,” Fearnley
said in the report. “The larger tonnage are not unscathed with
a very quiet market and few deals concluded.”  Twenty-three tankers were hired or expected to be chartered
for the two-week period, the survey showed. That’s four more
than last week.  The vessels booked or due to be hired would be able to haul
about 7.23 million barrels of the fuel, or 517,000 barrels a
day. That’s 75 percent of the 688,000 barrels the U.S.  imported 
daily over the past year, according to the Energy Department.  The survey is based on so-called single-voyage, or spot,
charters and excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. It
assumes shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwestern
 Europe . Each tanker would normally haul about 37,000 metric tons
of gasoline, or 315,000 barrels.  Following is a table of vessels chartered and likely to be
hired for the trans-Atlantic voyage loading over the two-week
periods from the dates shown. The table also displays the number
of ships available to be booked.  *T                              July 5     June 27     Change
