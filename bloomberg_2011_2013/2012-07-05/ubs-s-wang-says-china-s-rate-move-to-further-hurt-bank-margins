Tao Wang , a Hong Kong-based economist
at  UBS AG (UBSN) , comments on China’s second interest-rate cut in a
month.  The People’s Bank of China said today the one-year lending
rate will fall by 31 basis points and the one-year deposit rate
will drop by 25 basis points effective tomorrow. Banks can offer
loans of as much as 30 percent less than benchmark rates, the
central bank said on its website.  “The rate cut is unexpected, very soon after the first cut
in June. The government is getting increasingly concerned about
growth and the lack of credit demand.”  UBS forecasts June industrial production growth to have
remained “weak” at 9 percent, and second-quarter gross
domestic product expansion to have slowed to 7.6 percent, Wang
said. Banks’ new lending may have fallen short of market
expectation of about 900 billion  yuan  to 1 trillion yuan, the
economist said.  “We maintain that the interest rate cut will not do much
to stimulate growth. It is lending restrictions that need to be
eased and that government investment need to go up, and we do
expect more actions on that front.”  “The asymmetric cut in  interest rates  will hurt banks’
margin further. This also means that the government has made the
decision to support the corporate sector at the expense of the
banks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
