Cengage Learning Inc., the
educational company owned by  Apax Partners  LLP, said Chief
Executive Officer Ronald G. Dunn will become executive chairman,
replacing David Shaffer who is retiring in September.  Cengage Learning is “in the advanced stages of a search to
identify” a CEO to replace Dunn, the company said today in a
filing on its  website . “No other senior executive changes are
anticipated.”  Dunn, 65, will take on the role of executive chairman when
his successor joins the company, Cengage said. Shaffer will
retire on Sept. 30, it said.  Cengage Learning, formerly Thomson Learning, was acquired
by British buyout-firm Apax Partners for about $7.1 billion in
2007. The company develops teaching materials for colleges,
schools, libraries and corporations, and provides print and
electronic publishing. Cengage last year acquired National
Geographic Society’s school-publishing unit.  “In his full-time role as executive chairman, Mr Dunn will
work closely with his successor on strategic initiatives and
general management matters,” the company said. “This
arrangement will ensure a smooth transition to a new CEO while
preserving Mr Dunn’s experience for the company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
