Thuega AG’s renewable energy unit
bought 11  wind turbines  in four German states from project
developers as the venture between regional utilities seeks to
boost the amount of power it generates from alternative sources.  The turbines in  Lower Saxony , Saxony-Anhalt, Rhineland-
Palatinate and Brandenburg will generate about 49 gigawatt-hours
of power, enough to supply about 14,000 households, Munich-based
Thuega Erneuerbare Energien GmbH said today in a statement.  The investments will raise the capacity of the division’s
wind power generation to 81 megawatts from 56 megawatts,
according to the statement. The company, which plans to spend 1
billion euros ($1.2 billion) on renewable energy by 2020, didn’t
disclose the purchase price.  Ten of the turbines are already in operation, Carmen
Meinhold, a spokeswoman for Thuega, said in a phone interview.  The company may invest in projects in countries bordering
 Germany , pending changes to its corporate charter, according to
the statement. Thuega Erneuerbare Energien is owned by 34
municipal and regional utilities and Thuega AG, a holding
company for stakes in those and other German energy suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
