What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that the
highest prices in nine months will slow demand for the grain to
make ethanol and animal feed, Jason Roose, a vice president for
U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines , Iowa, said in a
telephone interview. An Energy Department report today showed
ethanol production last week sank to the lowest since Sept. 23.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT because demand may slow after prices rose to the
highest in almost four years, Roose said.  -- Wheat futures may steady to down 2 cents a bushel on the
CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  on speculation that the highest U.S. prices in 14
months will reduce overseas demand, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
