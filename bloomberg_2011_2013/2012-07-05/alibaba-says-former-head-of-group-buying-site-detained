Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.,  China ’s
biggest e-commerce company, said a former general manager of its
group-buying website was detained by the police on suspicion of
accepting bribes.  The official of the Juhuasuan website was removed from his
position in March for misconduct, according to a  statement 
posted on Alibaba’s e-commerce website Taobao.com yesterday.  Taobao, China’s biggest online shopping website with 500
million user accounts, set up a department in 2010 to handle
complaints about the behavior of employees. In May, Alibaba said
police arrested some workers at the Internet shopping site after
a “small” number were accused of accepting improper benefits
from vendors.  “We are transparently communicating with customers,
vendors and third parties, as well as employees, when we find a
situation involving misconduct inside the company,” John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Alibaba, said by e-mail
yesterday. “We’ve noted a handful of situations over the past
18 months that once detected were acted upon swiftly.”  Alibaba.com Ltd., a separate Alibaba Group unit, said in
February 2011 that an internal probe found more than 2,300
vendors used its website to defraud global buyers, prompting
then-Chief Executive Officer David Wei to quit. The unit had
said it will visit the facilities of all paying suppliers as
part of its efforts to strengthen protection of buyers on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
