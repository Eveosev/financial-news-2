New York  gasoline rose for a fourth
day after inventories in the region fell to the lowest level
this year.  Stockpiles of the fuel on the East Coast fell 1.75 million
barrels to 52.3 million barrels last week, the Energy Department
reported. European inventories of the fuel also slipped to the
lowest level in almost eight months, decreasing incentives to
ship fuel from the continent.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York narrowed 0.5 cent to 4.25 cents a
gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 2:16 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 5.18 cents to $2.7272 a gallon.  East Coast inventories slipped for the third time in four
weeks to reach the lowest level since Nov. 11. Gasoline
stockpiles in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading hub, dropped 5.6 percent to
588,000 metric tons in the week ended today, according to PJK
International BV, a researcher in the Netherlands. That’s the
lowest level since Nov. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
