Laurence D. Fink used at least half a
dozen acquisitions to expand  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  from a boutique bond
shop to the world’s biggest  money manager . Now the firm, which
invests $3.7 trillion for clients around the world, faces a new
challenge: Growing on its own.  Susan L. Wagner, who led BlackRock’s growth by overseeing
purchases including the fund units of Merrill Lynch & Co. and
Barclays Plc, retired last month, signaling an end to the
acquisition spree and underscoring that future expansion will
have to come from attracting investor deposits. With performance
at actively managed stock and bond funds trailing peers,
BlackRock has restructured its fixed-income unit and replaced
equity chief investment strategist  Robert Doll , 57, who said
last month he was leaving.  “Size makes growth difficult,” said Lucas Montgomery, a
research analyst who covers assets managers at Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. in  New York . “Growth is predicated on them
winning market share and that requires a combination of
distribution and performance.”  Wagner’s departure leaves BlackRock with three of the eight
co-founders in an active management role, including Fink, who is
chairman and chief executive officer, and  Robert Kapito , the
president. As founders left, Fink added top executives such as
Philipp Hildebrand, the former head of the Swiss central bank,
to help expand relationships with institutional clients
overseas, and Linda Robinson, who joined as head of marketing
and communications last year to oversee a five-year branding
campaign.  Treasury Role  Fink himself, in private conversations with other Wall
Street executives, hasn’t ruled out that he would be interested
in the position of  Treasury Secretary , should Obama get re-
elected, said a person familiar with the matter who asked for
anonymity because the conversations weren’t public. Treasury
Secretary  Timothy Geithner  has said he doesn’t expect the
president to ask him to stay in office if he wins a second term.  Fink hasn’t said publicly whether he would be interested in
a government role if nominated. He told a senior member of his
management team this month that he has the best job in the world
at BlackRock, according to the person.  Lauren Trengrove, a spokeswoman for BlackRock, declined to
comment.  The most-senior executive at BlackRock after Fink is
Kapito, who is responsible for day-to-day oversight of the
firm’s operating units, including  portfolio management ,
alternative investments, the global client group, risk and
quantitative analysis and the BlackRock Solutions advisory
business. Kapito is also a director of iShares Inc., the firm’s
exchange-traded fund unit, and worked with Fink at First Boston
before joining him to start BlackRock in 1988.  Remaining Founders  BlackRock’s remaining co-founders apart from Fink and
Kapito are Bennett Golub, chief risk officer, and Barbara
Novick, the firm’s head of government relations. Novick isn’t a
member of BlackRock’s 14-person global executive committee.  Wagner, who in more than two decades at BlackRock has
served at various times as chief operating officer and head of
corporate strategy and led the alternative-investments business,
will join BlackRock’s board of directors in October. She’ll
continue to serve as a director of DSP BlackRock Investment
Managers, the firm’s joint venture in India.  BlackRock’s growth through acquisitions culminated in the
2009 purchase of  Barclays Global Investors , which was an
unprecedented attempt to merge an active fund company, whose
managers pick individual stocks and bonds, with a manager of
passive funds such as exchange-traded funds, which track broad
market benchmarks.  Barclays Deal  Since BlackRock announced the BGI deal on June 12, 2009,
the stock has  returned  6.4 percent, compared with a 16 percent
return for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of asset managers and
custody banks. This year, the shares have fallen 0.8 percent,
including reinvested dividends, while the asset manager index
rose 13 percent through July 3.  Barclays, which took a stake in BlackRock at the time of
the transaction, in May said it would sell its entire 19.6
percent holding in the asset manager amid tighter  capital
requirements . As part of the transaction, BlackRock bought back
$1 billion of shares.  Earnings Growth  BlackRock has 11 buy recommendations from analysts who
cover the shares, while eight recommend holding the shares and
two recommend selling. BlackRock’s shares trade at 13.1 times
estimated earnings, making the shares cheaper than publicly
traded peers such as Legg Mason Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group
Inc., which trade at multiples of 14.2 and 19.1, respectively,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BlackRock’s breadth of offerings makes it a competitor to a
variety of asset-management firms. On the fixed-income side, its
biggest rival is Pacific Investment Management Co., the money
manager owned by  Allianz SE . Pimco, led by  Bill Gross  and
Mohamed El-Erian, drew $60 billion in net deposits across its
products last year, compared with net withdrawals of $13.7
billion for BlackRock.  While ETFs generally carry lower fees than active mutual
funds, the BGI takeover shielded BlackRock as investors
abandoned active stock funds industrywide following the 2008
credit crisis and  Europe ’s sovereign-debt woes. Clients pulled a
combined $40 billion from BlackRock’s active stock and bond
funds in 2011, while putting in $52 billion into its iShares
stock and bond ETFs, according to the firm’s quarterly earnings
reports.  Trailing Peers  In the three years ended June 30, BlackRock’s actively
managed U.S. mutual funds trailed 54 percent of peers on an
annualized basis, according to data compiled by Morningstar Inc.
in  Chicago . Only about 6 percent of BlackRock’s assets are in
actively managed U.S. retail funds, according to the firm.  As BlackRock tries to woo investors back into its active
strategies, it has made changes to boost performance. Chris Leavy, who joined BlackRock as chief investment officer of U.S.
fundamental equity in October 2010 from OppenheimerFunds Inc.,
has taken over the responsibility of BlackRock’s large-cap
portfolios from Doll. The large-cap series at BlackRock account
for about $22 billion of the $110 billion in U.S. active
strategies.  Doll said he was stepping down to devote more time to his
family, faith and philanthropic interests. Under Doll,
BlackRock’s Large Cap Core Fund has declined at an annual rate
of 2.9 percent over the past five years, trailing 92 percent of
peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Doll, Rice  BlackRock in January changed the description of the
investment process for three stock mutual funds run by Doll to
show the funds use models from third-party providers that are
then adjusted. The prospectuses had previously described the
model as proprietary.  The change was made in the regular process of keeping the
fund board up-to-date on its management and to provide more
detail about the investment model and methods used to construct
the portfolio, BlackRock said last month.  In a separate incident related to disclosure, BlackRock’s
Daniel Rice, who helped manage five energy and natural resource
mutual funds, last month stepped down to avoid the appearance of
a conflict of interest. Rice is one of the founders of Rice
Energy, a company with a subsidiary that has a joint venture
with one of his mutual fund’s top holdings.  Greater Autonomy  In actively managed fixed-income funds, where BlackRock saw
investor withdrawals last year while bond funds industrywide had
deposits, the firm has started to give unit heads greater
autonomy and accountability, according to an internal memo sent
to some employees. Previously, the day-to-day business
management was handled under a single unit.  Under the new structure, Rick Rieder, who serves as CIO of
fundamental fixed income, will head credit, rates and
alternative strategies; Kevin Holt, CIO of model-based fixed
income will lead the multi-sector area; Tim Webb is in charge of
Europe, the  Middle East  and  Africa  as well as the Asia Pacific
region; and  Peter Hayes  heads tax-exempt strategies.  “BlackRock continually makes adjustments within the
organization to adapt to changing environments and better meet
the evolving needs of our clients, and the firm will continue to
aggressively pursue such changes,”  Brian Beades , a spokesman
for BlackRock, said in an e-mailed statement.  Alternative Assets  With investors still shying away from the stock market, and
bond yields at or near record lows, BlackRock is tapping other
areas of growth. Fink said in a March 2012 letter to
shareholders that BlackRock is investing in alternative assets
such as  hedge funds , retirement-oriented strategies and products
that allocate money across multiple asset classes.  Under Matthew Botein, head of BlackRock’s alternatives
unit, the firm has expanded by adding businesses, including the
acquisition of the private equity and infrastructure fund-of-
funds unit from Swiss Re Ltd., announced this week.  BlackRock has also stepped up sales efforts across the
globe. Hildebrand, who resigned as head of the  Swiss National
Bank  in January, is joining as vice chairman to oversee
relationships with institutional clients outside the U.S. He
will report directly to Fink.  Hildebrand, who worked for hedge fund Moore Capital
Management LLC in the late 1990s, joined the Swiss central bank
in 2003, becoming its youngest ever policy maker. He left on
Jan. 9 over the purchase of $504,000 by his wife Kashya
Hildebrand in August, three weeks before the SNB imposed a
currency cap. A probe concluded in April that Kashya Hildebrand’s transactions didn’t breach any regulations.  Marketing Campaign  To make the BlackRock brand better known with individual
investors, Fink embarked on a marketing campaign, telling
clients how to invest in an uncertain market. He and other
BlackRock executives have spoken publicly about how investors
can be harmed by staying in cash-like products and focusing on
short-term investing.  In May of last year, he named Robinson to the newly created
position of global head of marketing and communications.
Robinson, who founded communications firm Robinson Lerer &
Montgomery in 1986, is reporting directly to Fink.  “One of our most important jobs for the future is going to
be the continuation of building our brand,” Fink said last
year. “This is going to be a big and aggressive campaign over
the next five years.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
