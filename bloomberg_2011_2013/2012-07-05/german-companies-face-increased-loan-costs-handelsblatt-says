Banking regulation will increase
financing costs for German companies by about 5 billion euros
($6.3 billion) as banks pass on increased expenses to clients,
 Handelsblatt  reported citing a study by the Technical University
of Munich and the Association of Bavarian Business.  Germany â€™s small- and medium-sized companies, are more
reliant on bank loans than publicly trading companies that can
tap the markets for funds, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
