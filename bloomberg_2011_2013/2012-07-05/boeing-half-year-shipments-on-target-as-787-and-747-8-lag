Boeing Co. (BA)  delivered 150 aircraft in
the three months through June, positioning itself to meet a 2012
target even with year-to-date shipments of the new 787 and 747-8
models at only about a third of the planemaker’s goal.  Only six Dreamliners were shipped in the quarter, bringing
the half-year total to 11, and Boeing handed over seven 747-8
jumbo jets for a six-month tally of 13, the Chicago-based
company said today in a statement. Boeing’s plan, reiterated in
April, is to deliver 70 to 85 of those models this year, split
about evenly between them.  Total production is slated to increase by more than 60
percent in the four years through 2014 as Boeing works off a
record order backlog for about 4,000 aircraft. The company
delivered 287 planes in the first half out of a full-year goal
of 585 to 600 aircraft. That compares with 477 deliveries in
2011, including 222 in the first six months.  “While revenue is impacted by lower than anticipated
deliveries of 747 and 787, profitability should be enhanced by
the higher deliveries” of other models including the 737 and
the 777 in the second quarter, Stephen Levenson, an analyst with
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., wrote in a note today. “We are keeping
our conservative outlook for deliveries for the balance of the
year.”  Boeing, which is slated to report quarterly earnings on
July 25, rose 0.2 percent to $74.44 at the close in  New York 
trading. The shares have risen 1.5 percent this year.  Air India  The higher-than-expected number of 737s and 777s delivered
last quarter may contribute almost 10 cents a share to earnings,
Carter Copeland and Joe Campbell, analysts with Barclays Plc,
wrote in a note to clients. The light 787 deliveries “will have
limited impact on earnings per share given the low margin on the
program,” they wrote.  In the first half, Dreamliner deliveries were set back by
the discovery of improperly installed shims that had to be
replaced on all 55 planes built as of February.  Air India  Ltd.
also pushed back the handover of its first 787 amid talks over
compensation for the three-year delay to the jet’s entry into
service. There were no Dreamliner deliveries in February or May.  Second-quarter weakness in shipments appears to be related
to customer timing issues rather than manufacturing problems,
the Copeland and Campbell wrote.  Boeing expects to increase 787 deliveries in the second
half as it ramps up to building five jets a month later this
year and starts delivering planes from its new final-assembly
line in  South Carolina  as well as the main one near Seattle.  Last year, Boeing missed its target of delivering 15 to 20
of the two new models, which both entered service in the fourth
quarter of 2011. The planemaker delivered just three Dreamliners
and nine 747s. Boeing, which has unfilled orders for 845 of the
composite Dreamliners, is increasing output of that plane to 10
a month by the end of 2013.  The company had won orders for  440 new jets  through June
30, net of cancellations, according to its website update today.
The majority of those orders are for the new 737 MAX model that
Boeing began selling late last year. The company reported 230
orders in the first six months of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
