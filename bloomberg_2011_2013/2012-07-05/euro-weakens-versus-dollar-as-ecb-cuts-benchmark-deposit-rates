The euro fell against the dollar and
the yen after the  European Central Bank  cut its key  interest
rate  by 25 basis points to a  record  of 0.75 percent and reduced
its deposit rate to zero for the first time.  The 17-nation shared currency weakened versus 14 of its 16
major peers. While the median forecast of 64 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 25 basis-point cut, 10 forecast
no change and five predicted a reduction to 0.5 percent. ECB
President  Mario Draghi  will hold a press conference at 2.30 p.m.
in  Frankfurt  to explain the decision. The pound erased a decline
against the dollar after the  Bank of England  extended its bond-
purchase program and the Australian dollar advanced after China
cut benchmark interest rates.  “The market has been expecting a cut of at least 25 basis
points,” Michael Derks, chief strategist at FxPro Financial
Services Ltd. in London, said before the announcement. “The
economic diagnosis has worsened in the euro area and a rate cut
is pretty much a fait accompli.”  The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.2454 as of 12:52 p.m. in
London. The common currency tumbled 0.8 percent to 99.28 yen,
The dollar was 0.2 percent weaker at 79.69 yen.  The pound was little changed at $1.5584 after dropping as
much as 0.2 percent. Australia’s dollar jumped 0.4 percent to
$1.0313.  The euro gained 1 percent against the dollar and 1.6
percent versus the yen on June 6, when ECB policy makers held
the main rate at 1 percent.  The ECB last cut borrowing costs in December, when it
reduced its benchmark rate by 25 points to 1 percent following a
similar drop at the November meeting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
