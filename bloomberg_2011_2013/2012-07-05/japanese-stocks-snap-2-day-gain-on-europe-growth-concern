     July 5 (Bloomberg) --Japanese  stocks  swung between gains
and losses ahead of a policy meeting today at which the European
Cental Bank is expected to cut  interest rates  to a record low
and as services data in Germany and the U.K. added to signs of
the region’s economic slowdown.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
rose 1 percent as the yen weakened and  Bank of Japan  Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa said he’d do the utmost to ensure the
country’s financial stability. Osaka Securities Exchange Co.
added 0.7 percent after regulators approved its takeover by
 Tokyo  Stock Exchange Group Inc. GS Yuasa Corp. dropped 3.2
percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut the battery maker’s
price target.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.2 percent to 9,087.25
as of 10:32 a.m. in Tokyo after gaining as much as 0.3 percent.
The broader  Topix (MXAP)  Index slipped 0.1 percent to 777.82,
retreating from the highest level since May 2. Trading volume on
the gauge was 13 percent below the 30-day average ahead of the
ECB’s rate decision today and a U.S. jobs report tomorrow.  “One thing that’s common among all major central banks is
that they stand ready for further monetary easing if they see
the need,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a Tokyo-based senior
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which
oversees the equivalent of $70 billion. “Domestic factors have
a limited impact on Japanese shares, and so you don’t want to
make a big move ahead of major events abroad.”  Topix Rebound  The Topix has rebounded 12 percent since June 4, when it
plunged to its lowest since 1983, after euro-zone leaders agreed
to relax conditions for rescuing lenders and as speculation
mounted that central banks will support the global economy if
needed. The advance has boosted the average  price  of shares on
the gauge to 1.1 times book value, compared with 2.2 times for
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 1.4 times for the Europe
Stoxx 600 Index.  Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said today the
central bank will pursue appropriate monetary policy.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today as ECB officials are expected to lower their
benchmark rate by a quarter point to a record low of 0.75
percent today, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The  Bank of England  today will raise its
target for bond purchases, according to another Bloomberg survey.  “The market is likely to be in a gridlock,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , Tokyo-based chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co., which oversees about 40 billion yen
($501 million). “You want to wait and see how the ECB meeting
and the U.S. jobs data will come out. It’s not easy to buy or
sell.”  U.S. employers are expected to have increased payrolls by
90,000 workers in June after a 69,000 gain in May, according to
the median estimate of 59 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
ahead of Labor Department figures due tomorrow.  Bourse Merger  Japan Fair Trade Commission today approved Tokyo Stock
Exchange’s plan to acquire the Osaka exchange. The 480,000 yen-
per-share takeover will now proceed, and the deal is expected to
be completed by Jan. 1, the bourses said. Osaka Securities rose
0.7 percent to 3,000 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 2.6 percent to 19.96,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.7 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Foreign investors sold 50
billion yen in Japanese stocks last week, the Ministry of
Finance said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
