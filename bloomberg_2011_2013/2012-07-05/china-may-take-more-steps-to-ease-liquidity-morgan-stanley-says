Helen Qiao, the chief China economist
at Morgan Stanley, comments on China’s second interest-rate cut
in a month.  The People’s Bank of China said today the one-year lending
rate will fall by 31 basis points and the one-year deposit rate
will drop by 25 basis points effective tomorrow. Banks can offer
loans of as much as 30 percent less than benchmark rates, the
central bank said on its website.  “We believe the rate cut was triggered by the faster-than-
expected fall in CPI inflation.”  “We are expecting more quantitative measures to help ease
the liquidity in the system in the near future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
