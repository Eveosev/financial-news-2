Ecuadorean consumer prices rose the
most in two months in June while producer prices declined for
the first time since February, the National Statistics and
Census Institute said.  Living costs climbed 0.18 percent from the previous  month 
and increased 5 percent from a  year  earlier, the agency said in
a report on its  website . Producer prices declined 2.38 percent
from May and rose 3.08 percent from June 2011, the report said.  Ecuador’s economy in the first quarter posted its weakest
growth in two years as above-average rainfall damaged crops,
washed out roads and disrupted supply chains, spurring the
highest inflation in three years. Since then, price increases
have slowed as the rainy season ended and the global cost of  raw
materials  dropped to their lowest levels in nine months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The biggest monthly increase in consumer prices was a 1.72
percent jump in the cost of recreational and cultural
activities, while transportation prices fell 0.1 percent, the
report said.  Among producer prices, agriculture costs fell the most,
dropping 7.7 percent, while electricity, gas and water decreased
4.46 percent, the agency said.  Consumer prices rose most in the highland city of Ambato,
jumping 1.35 percent. In Guayaquil, the nation’s largest city,
the cost of living rose 0.27 percent, the agency said. Ecuador,
the smallest member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, subsidizes fuel costs and the domestic use of natural
gas.  Consumer price increases are forecast to average 5.14
percent this year compared with 4.47 percent in 2011 while the
economy may expand 5.35 percent, according to the  Finance
Ministry ’s 2012 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
