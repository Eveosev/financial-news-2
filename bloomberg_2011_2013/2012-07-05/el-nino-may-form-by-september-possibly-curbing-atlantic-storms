An El Nino may be about to form in
the equatorial  Pacific Ocean , which may create a curb on
hurricanes in the Atlantic as the storm season reaches its most
active phase.  The number of warm spots across the central Pacific has
grown, leading climatologists to believe an El Nino may form
between now and September, according to the  U.S. Climate
Prediction Center  in  Camp Springs , Maryland.  “Overall, the forecaster consensus reflects increased
chances for El Nino,” the center said a statement today. An El
Nino watch posted last month was continued.  The phenomenon increases Atlantic wind shear that can keep
tropical systems from forming, decreasing the total number of
storms during the June 1 to Nov. 30 season, which peaks from
Aug. 20 to Oct. 20.  El Nino also has been known to bring about mild winters
across the northern U.S. and western  Canada  as well as more rain
to the U.S. South. It occurs every two to five years on average,
and lasts about 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
