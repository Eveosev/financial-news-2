President  Barack Obama  will kick off
his two-day bus tour of Ohio and Pennsylvania today by telling
voters in the heavily industrial region that his administration
is filing an unfair trade complaint against some of China’s new
duties on American-made cars, the White House said.  The U.S. is filing the case today with the World Trade
Organization in Geneva, according to a White House fact sheet.
The administration is accusing China of imposing unfair duties
on $3.3 billion in U.S. auto exports, the fact sheet said.  The president’s action was earlier reported by The Blade in
Toledo, Ohio. The city is home to a plant that manufactures the
 Jeep Wrangler , owned by Chrysler Group LLC, one of the auto
companies that the administration says is being
disproportionately hit by the Chinese duties, which were imposed
in December.  The message fits with the president’s theme that
presumptive Republican nominee  Mitt Romney  would have let the
auto industry go bankrupt while he saved  General Motors Co. (GM)  and
Chrysler through a taxpayer rescue of the auto industry in 2009.  Today Obama starts a two-day “Betting on America” bus
tour designed to draw a contrast with Romney, a former private-
equity executive who invested overseas.  Polls show that linking Romney to the outsourcing of U.S.
jobs when he was at Boston-based Bain Capital LLC, which he co-
founded, is an effective approach with voters in the swing
states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, where Obama will end the trip.  To contact the reporter on this story:
