Asian  stocks  fell for a second day,
paring this week’s gain, as sales at Samsung Electronics Co.
missed analysts’ estimates and interest-rate cuts in Europe and
 China  failed to boost confidence in the global economy.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese camera maker that gets 31 percent of
its sales in Europe, slid 2.5 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s biggest mining company, fell 1 percent as investors sold
shares of companies with earnings tied to economic growth.
 Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  led a slide among Chinese banks,
dropping 2.5 percent.  Parco Co. (8251)  climbed 2.5 percent in  Tokyo 
after J Front Retailing Co. said it will buy a majority stake in
the rival department-store operator.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  slid 0.5 percent to 118.44 as of 6:57
p.m. in Tokyo. About five shares fell for every three that rose,
with technology shares exerting the biggest drag on the index.
The gauge has lost 8.2 percent from this year’s high in February
amid concern economic growth in China and the U.S. is slowing as
Europe’s debt crisis deepens. The measure gained 1.1 percent
this week.  “We are still reasonably cautious,” said Tim Riordan, who
helps manage $200 million at Parker Asset Management Ltd., a
hedge fund in Sydney. “All of these moves by central banks had
been expected, so they were baked into the price. ECB rate cuts
are getting to the point where each cut is met with diminishing
returns.”  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  dropped 0.9 percent, led by
Samsung, which accounts for 16 percent of the index by weight.
The largest maker of televisions and mobile phones reported
sales of 47 trillion won ($41 billion), trailing the 49.8
trillion-won average of 35 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The shares lost 2 percent to 1.161 million won.  U.S. Jobs  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 0.7 percent and
the broader Topix Index retreated 0.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index was little changed, while China’s Shanghai Composite
Index surged 1 percent as developers and industrial companies
gained. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 0.3 percent.  Singapore’s Straits Times Index gained 0.2 percent, capping
eight days of gains, the longest winning streak since April
2011. The last time the index rose for more than eight straight
days was in January 2006.  CapitaLand Ltd. jumped 10 percent this week, the most on
the city state’s benchmark, on speculation Southeast Asia’s
biggest developer will benefit from declining borrowing costs in
China, which contributes about 22 percent of the company’s
revenue.  Golden Agri-Resources Ltd. (GGR) , the world’s second-biggest
palm oil grower, climbed 7.5 percent through the week as crude
palm oil futures rose for a third week in  Kuala Lumpur .  Rate Cuts  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2
percent today. The gauge slid 0.5 percent yesterday, halting a
three-day advance, amid disappointment over Europe’s efforts to
tame the region’s debt crisis and before a U.S. jobs report
expected to show the pace of hiring in June remained at less
than half the average for the first quarter of the year.  In a 45-minute span yesterday, the ECB and People’s Bank of
China cut their benchmark borrowing costs, while the  Bank of
England  raised the size of its asset-purchase program. ECB
policy makers refrained from announcing more measures to cap
borrowing costs in Italy and Spain.  Some “downside risks to the euro-area economic outlook
have materialized,” ECB president  Mario Draghi  said when
lowering the main refinancing rate and the deposit rate by 25
basis points to 0.75 percent and zero respectively.  The  International Monetary Fund  will reduce its estimate
for global growth this year on weakness in investment, jobs and
manufacturing in Europe, the U.S., Brazil, India and China,
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said in a speech in Tokyo
today.  Year’s Gain  The MSCI Asia-Pacific gained 4.5 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with an 8.8 percent advance by the  S&P 500 
and a 5.1 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are  valued  at 12 times  estimated earnings 
on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500 and 10.8
times for the Stoxx 600.  Canon lost 2.5 percent to 3,120 yen. Konica Minolta
Holdings Inc., a film maker that depends on Europe for more than
a quarter of its sales, sank 2.3 percent to 625 yen. Esprit
Holdings Ltd., a  Hong Kong  retailer that makes 79 percent of
revenue in debt-stricken Europe, declined 3.9 percent to
HK$9.65.  BHP Billiton , the world’s largest mining company, slid 1
percent to A$32.09. Rio Tinto Group, third-biggest, declined 1.5
percent to A$57.80.  Chinese banks  trading in Hong Kong declined as Barclays Plc
analyst May Yan said the average net income for the industry in
2013 may fall as much as 54 percent following two interest-rate
cuts in a month.  Agricultural Bank of China  declined 2.5 percent
to HK$3.11. Bank of Communications Ltd. slid 2.5 percent to
HK$5.11.  Parco gained 2.5 percent to 971 yen after J Front offered
