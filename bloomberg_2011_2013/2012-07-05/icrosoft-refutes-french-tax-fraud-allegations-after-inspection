Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s French unit said it
complies with local tax laws and said that the appeals court in
Versailles, France, validated its accounts in a February

office by tax authorities “will end once again with the
conclusion that Microsoft fully complies with French tax laws,”
the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
