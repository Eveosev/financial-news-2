Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503) , which
supplies Japan’s second-biggest metropolitan area, may cut its
crude consumption by more than half after it resumes two nuclear
reactors to ease the threat of a summer power shortage.  “Theoretically, the restart of the two reactors at Ohi
plant would reduce  Kansai Electric ’s crude-oil requirement
roughly by 60,000 barrels a day,” Osamu Fujisawa, an
independent oil economist in Tokyo who worked for Saudi Arabian
Oil Co. and  Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002) , said in a telephone
interview yesterday. Kansai Electric used 510,000 kiloliters of
crude in May, or about 103,000 barrels a day.  Kansai’s two 1,180-megawatt reactors at its Ohi plant
northeast of  Osaka  will be fully operational this month, Japan’s
Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told reporters today in
 Tokyo . That ends a two-month period when all the country’s 50
reactors were offline for safety checks following the March 2011
Fukushima disaster. Without atomic power, Kansai’s output may
fall 14.9 percent short of peak demand in a heat wave similar to
the one in 2010, a government panel said in May.  Osaka-based Kansai also consumed about 20,000 kiloliters of
fuel oil, 590,000 metric tons of liquefied natural gas and
400,000 tons of coal in May, Takahiro Senoh, a company spokesman
in Tokyo, said by telephone today. Japanese utilities’ crude use
rose 148 percent to 1.19 million kiloliters in May from a year
earlier, according to the Federation of Electric Power
Companies.  “Crude oil accounts for 90 percent of our oil consumption
for electricity generation,” Senoh said. “The restart of the
two reactors will reduce the company’s fuel consumption.
Logically speaking, the reduction will be on the most expensive
crude oil.”  Nuclear Opposition  Kansai started electricity generation at its No. 3 reactor
at the Ohi plant today,  Japan ’s trade ministry said in an e-
mailed statement, citing the utility. The unit will be fully
operational as early as July 9, according to Senoh. The No. 4
unit will begin power generation as early as July 21 after a
restart scheduled for between July 18 and July 20, he said.  Thousands of people opposing the restart of the Ohi plant
protested in the streets outside the prime minister’s office in
Tokyo on June 29,  Kyodo News  reported.  Japan’s LNG imports may rise 6.5 percent to about 88.6
million tons in the fiscal year ending March 2013, compared with
the prior year, if no more reactors are brought back online
after Kansai, a group of five researchers at the Institute of
Energy Economics, a government affiliated think-tank, said in a
July 2 report.  Fuel-oil  sales to power utilities in the same period may
rise by 43 percent to 21.3 million kiloliters, or about 367,000
barrels a day, Yu Nagatomi, an economist said in the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
