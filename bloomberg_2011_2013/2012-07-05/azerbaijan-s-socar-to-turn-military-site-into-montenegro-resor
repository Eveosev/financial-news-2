Montenegro has chosen the  State Oil
Company of Azerbaijan Republic , or Socar, to turn its former
military site into a holiday resort for 258 million euros ($319
million).  Socar is expected to invest “at least 52 million euros
into the resort’s development during the first four years of the
lease, or 258 million euros in total during the first eight-year
period of the lease,” Montenegro’s Council for Privatization
and Capital Projects said in an e-mail today.  Socar will get a 90-year lease and pay the rent for the
first 45-year period upfront, including a fixed 1 euro per
square meter and a variable 5 percent of the profit for the new
development sprawling over 241,695 square meters of the Orijen
Battalion barracks in Kumbor, 116 kilometers (72 miles)
southwest of  Montenegro ’s capital Podgorica, the Council said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
