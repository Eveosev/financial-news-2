French sugar production from beets is
set to fall in the coming crop year as wet and cool weather
slows root development, hurting potential yields, industry
researcher Institut Technique de Betterave said.  Sugar output is forecast between 13.2 and 15.1 metric tons
a hectare (2.47 acres) of beets in the 2012-13 season, the
Paris-based institute wrote in a monthly online report published
today. It gave a median estimate of 13.8 tons and said final
yields will depend on summer weather.  France  is the European Union’s largest sugar producer and
exporter. The country’s beet-sugar production will slip to 4.62
million tons in the coming season from 4.78 million tons in
2011-12, the 27-nation bloc forecasts.  “It seems that this year the weather condition benefited
leaf growth to the detriment of root growth,” the ITB said.
“For a given amount of leaf development, the production of root
biomass is inferior to that of the past four years.”  The expected yield compares with last year’s 15 tons of
beet sugar a hectare, ITB Director General Marc Richard-Molard
said by phone from Paris. He said the French sugar crop is
expected to be smaller.  June rainfall in the main beet-growing regions exceeded
normal amounts by 45 millimeters (1.8 inches) and temperatures
on average were 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) lower
than usual, the ITB said. Sunshine hours were 30 percent to 40
percent of normal, it said.  “This covered, cool and very wet weather has above all
benefited the growth of foliage, which everywhere is very
abundant,” the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
