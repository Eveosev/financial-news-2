Asian currencies fell after data
indicated an economic slump is deepening in  Europe , bolstering
demand for the relative safety of the dollar.  India’s rupee led losses as the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
shares snapped a six-day advance. Euro-area services and
manufacturing output shrank in June for a fifth month and
services unexpectedly contracted in Germany, reports showed
yesterday. The  European Central Bank  will cut its benchmark
interest rate today, according to 53 of 63 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The Philippine peso strengthened after a
sovereign-rating upgrade yesterday.  “There seems to be dollar demand as investors may want to
square positions before some events like the ECB meeting,” said
Disawat Tiaowvanich, a currency trader at  Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL) 
“The baht is weaker after some stock selling by foreigners.”  The rupee slid 0.9 percent to 55.0050 per dollar as of 2:08
p.m. in Mumbai, while  Thailand ’s baht slipped 0.3 percent to
31.53 after hitting a two-week high yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysia’s ringgit fell 0.2 percent to
3.1613 and Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.3 percent to 9,393. The
peso advanced 0.4 percent to 41.68, after touching a four-year
high of 41.60 yesterday.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (MXAP)  fell for a second
day, with its 60-day historical volatility steady at 3.51
percent. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against
the currencies of six major trading partners, rose 0.5 percent.  India Debt Quota  The rupee slumped after India fell short of its target at a
sale of bond-investment permits to foreign investors. Global
funds bought just 402.5 billion rupees ($7.3 billion) of 599
billion rupees of debt quota offered at an auction yesterday,
two people familiar with the matter said. In Thailand, global
funds sold $70 million more shares than they bought yesterday,
exchange data show.  “Investors are still cautious on India given the state of
the economy,” said Chin Loo Thio, Singapore-based senior
currency analyst at BNP Paribas SA. “The fundamental concerns
remain and so monetary easing in the developed economies might
not directly lead to inflows into  India .”  The peso bucked the regional trend after  Standard & Poor’s 
raised the debt rating for the  Philippines  by a level to BB+,
one step below investment grade and the highest since 2003.  ‘What the Market Expected’  “It’s a confirmation of what the market expected,” said
Rajeev De Mello, head of Asian fixed-income assets at Schroder
Investment Management Ltd. in Singapore. “It would be positive
for the currency as well as external and domestic bonds.”  The ringgit dropped for a second day before a meeting today
at which all 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast  Bank
Negara Malaysia  will keep its overnight rate at 3 percent. The
decision is due at 6 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .  The  yuan  declined 0.13 percent to 6.3559 per dollar as the
People’s Bank of China weakened its daily fixing by 0.11 percent
at 6.3193, the most since June 25.  Elsewhere, South Korea’s won rose to 1,135.15 per dollar
from 1.135.70 yesterday. Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.1 percent to
NT$29.89 and the Vietnamese dong was steady at 20,885.  To contact the reporters on this story:
