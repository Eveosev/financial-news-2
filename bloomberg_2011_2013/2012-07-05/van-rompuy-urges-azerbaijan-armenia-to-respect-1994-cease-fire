European Council President Herman van Rompuy urged  Azerbaijan  and  Armenia  to respect the cease-fire
they signed in 1994 to prevent a further escalation of a
conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  “The European Union calls on both sides to strictly
respect the cease-fire,” Rompuy said today in the Azeri
capital, Baku.  At least ten soldiers were killed in clashes between Azeri
and Armenian forces last month. The two countries fought over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly ethnic Armenian region that broke
free of Azerbaijan’s control after the disintegration of the
 Soviet Union  in 1991.  Armenians seized Nagorno-Karabakh and seven adjacent
districts from Azerbaijan in a war that killed about 30,000
people and displaced more than a million before a cease-fire
agreement was brokered by Russia in 1994. The sides have yet
sign a peace agreement.  The EU supports the efforts of the so-called Minsk Group of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, co-
chaired by the U.S., Russia and France, to find a peaceful
solution to the conflict, Rompuy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
