Egyptian General Petroleum Corp.
plans to postpone until August the announcement of results from
a bidding round for oil and natural-gas rights that closed in
March.  The one-month delay will give the state-owned company more
time to evaluate the offers, especially because some bidders are
new to  Egypt , Deputy Chief Executive Officer for Agreements Adel
Kamel said today in a telephone interview from Cairo. The
company, also known as EGPC, is assessing 25 offers after it
invited bids in September, the first such auction since July
2009, he said.  Egypt holds Africa’s sixth-largest oil reserves, at 4.3
billion barrels, and the continent’s third-biggest gas deposits,
at 77 trillion cubic feet, according to  BP Plc (BP/)  data as of the
end of 2011. The North African country is struggling to attract
foreign investment since an uprising last year that ousted
former President  Hosni Mubarak .  A pipeline that supplied gas to  Israel  and Jordan was
disrupted after multiple sabotage attacks in the eastern Sinai
region, leading Egypt to annul its agreement to sell gas to
Israel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
