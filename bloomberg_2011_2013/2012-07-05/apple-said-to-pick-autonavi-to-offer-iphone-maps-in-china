AutoNavi Holdings Ltd. (AMAP) , a Chinese
maker of electronic navigation tools, was chosen by  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
to offer map services for users of future iPhones and iPads in
China, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  AutoNavi will supply its maps of China to users of the iOS
6 operating system, an upgrade for iPhones and iPads that will
be released by Apple this fall, according to one of the people,
who asked not to be named before an announcement.  In June, Apple introduced its own maps tool for users of
iOS 6, replacing a service currently offered by  Google Inc. (GOOG)  The
iPhone maker is adding technology partners in  China  including
AutoNavi,  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  and  Sina Corp. (SINA)  to expand the range of
services to Chinese consumers and meet rising local demand for
its mobile devices.  Helen Zhu, a spokeswoman at AutoNavi in Beijing, declined
to comment on the company’s business with Apple. Carolyn Wu, a
spokeswoman at Apple in Beijing, declined to comment on future
products by the company.  AutoNavi, based in Beijing, accounted for 45 percent of
China’s mobile map market in the first quarter, compared with 43
percent for second-ranked NavInfo Co., according to data from
research company Analysys International.  AutoNavi fell 0.5 percent to $13.27 in New York trading on
July 3. The Chinese company’s stock has gained 32 percent this
year, outperforming the Shenzhen-traded shares of NavInfo.  In 2010, AutoNavi agreed to set up a joint venture with
 TomTom NV (TOM2)  in China. TomTom, based in Amsterdam, last month said
it signed a licensing agreement with Apple on mapping data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
