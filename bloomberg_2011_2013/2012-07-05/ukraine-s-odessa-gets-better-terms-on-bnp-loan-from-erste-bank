The Ukrainian city of Odessa agreed
improved terms with Austria’s  Erste Bank AG (EBS)  on a Swiss franc
loan granted by  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  five years ago.  Odessa Municipal Council repaid Erste 10 million ($10.3
million) francs of the 40 million francs outstanding on the loan
and refinanced the rest, the Austrian bank’s local unit said
today in an e-mailed statement from the capital, Kiev.  Erste agreed to convert 15 million francs into hryvnia with
an annual interest rate of 19.65 percent and cut the interest
rate on the other 15 million francs by one percentage point to
7.5 percent, according to the statement. Odessa will make
interest payments monthly and principle repayments quarterly and
will clear the loan in full by Dec. 15, 2015.  Odessa borrowed 50 million francs from BNP for five years
in 2007 at an 8.5 percent annual  interest rate , data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It repaid 10 million francs in December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
