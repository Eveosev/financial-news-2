Manik Narain, the head of emerging-
market currency strategy at UBS AG in  London , comments on China
cutting benchmark  interest rates  for the second time this month.  The one-year lending rate will fall by 31 basis points and
the one-year deposit rate will drop by 25 basis points effective
tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said on its website today.
Banks can offer loans of as much as 30 percent less than
benchmark rates, it said.  “The Chinese action has happened faster than the markets
were expecting. It is quite an aggressive cut and more powerful
than the headline suggests as China has increased the ability
for banks to pass on lower borrowing costs to the economy.  “This will be taken as a sign that China is undertaking
further steps to support the economy and a recovery through the
second half of the year, given that the market has been
concerned about the trajectory of  China ’s recovery for some time.  “This is supportive for global sentiment and global
expectations of growth and will be a positive for emerging-
market currencies in the near term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
