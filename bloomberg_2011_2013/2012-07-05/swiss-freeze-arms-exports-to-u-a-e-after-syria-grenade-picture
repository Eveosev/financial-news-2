The Swiss government has frozen arms
exports to the  United Arab Emirates  and is conducting an inquiry
following allegations that one of its grenades has been found in
 Syria .  Federal authorities said the decisions followed the
publication on July 1 of a picture of a hand grenade said by the
SonntagsZeitung newspaper to have been found in the Syrian town
of Marea.  Switzerland  says it has not exported arms to Syria
since 1998.  “The hand grenade photographed originates from a shipment
made by Ruag to the United Arab Emirates in 2003,” the Swiss
government said in a statement yesterday. “At present, there is
no evidence that Swiss hand grenades have found their way to
Syria. Inquiries are ongoing however.”  Ruag Holding AG is a Swiss government-owned company
producing guns and missiles for customers including the
country’s armed forces.  The Swiss government has contacted U.A.E. authorities
seeking further information, according to the statement.  Calls to the U.A.E. Foreign Ministry today weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
