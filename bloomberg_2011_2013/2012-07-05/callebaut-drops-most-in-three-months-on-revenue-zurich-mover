Barry Callebaut AG (BARN)  fell the most in
three months in Zurich after the world’s largest maker of bulk
chocolate reported sales growth that missed analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  fell as much as 3.5 percent to 826.50 Swiss
francs, the biggest intraday decline since April 2. The stock
traded at 830 francs at 9:58 a.m.  Revenue rose 2.3 percent in the nine months through May to
3.59 billion francs ($3.74 billion) while sales by volume rose
6.6 percent, the Zurich-based company said today in a statement.
The median of three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News
was for sales of 3.69 billion francs. Sales fell 3.4 percent in
 Europe  in a context the company described as “difficult” in
the western part of its biggest market.  The figures are “just slightly below expectations,” Jean- Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel, wrote in a note
to clients, adding the market consensus was for 7.7 percent
volume growth. “The current valuation is on the high side.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
