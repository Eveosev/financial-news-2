A group of U.S. senators asked 15
defense contractors, including  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  and
 Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , to assess the potential business effects
of across-the-board cuts in military spending set to start in
January.  The six Republicans and an independent who serve on the
Senate Armed Services Committee, want the companies to detail
Pentagon contracts that may end or be reduced if $500 billion in
defense cuts over 10 years takes effect starting on Jan. 2. The
cuts will begin unless Congress and President  Barack Obama 
intervene.  “We believe that the administration and Congress must re-
address sequestration as a deficit-reduction tool as soon as
possible to avert the disastrous economic consequences of the
automatic budget cuts,” the lawmakers, led by Senator  John McCain  of Arizona, the committee’s senior Republican, wrote in a
letter dated today.  They asked in the letter what effects the cuts may have on
workers and suppliers and whether employees would be sent
advance notices that they may be fired after the cuts start.  The defense reductions are part of $1.2 trillion in
automatic, across-the-board cuts to domestic and national-
security programs that will start next year. The cuts were
imposed after talks failed last year on a bipartisan plan to
curb the nation’s debt.  In addition to the Republicans, Senator  Joe Lieberman , a
Connecticut independent, signed the letter.  Also among the companies receiving the letter were L-3
Communications Holdings Inc., Raytheon Corp., and Boeing Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
