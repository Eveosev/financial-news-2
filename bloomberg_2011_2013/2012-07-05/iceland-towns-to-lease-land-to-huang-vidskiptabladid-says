Seven municipalities in northern
Iceland have established a limited liability company, GaF ehf,
to purchase and then lease land to Chinese billionaire Huang Nubo, Vidskiptabladid reported, without saying how it obtained
the information.  Huang, whose attempt last year to buy the land for a golf
resort was blocked by the government, also intends to establish
a company on the island to facilitate the deal, the Reykjavik-
based newspaper said.  The government in November rejected a bid by Huang’s
Beijing Zhongkun Investment Group Co. to buy 300 square
kilometers (116 square miles) of land, arguing it would be
“incompatible” with the law amid opposition to foreign
ownership of property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
