Bahrain Petroleum Co., or Bapco,
expects to award a front-end engineering and design contract to
expand its only refinery in the first quarter of next year,
 Alwasat reported , citing Chief Executive Officer  Gordon Smith .  The state-run company will draw up a master plan for the
project next month and complete the expansion in 2018, Smith
said, according to the Bahraini newspaper. Bapco will also award
construction contracts this year to enlarge the pipeline
carrying oil to the refinery from neighboring  Saudi Arabia , the
report said.  The planned expansion of the refinery’s capacity to more
than 450,000 barrels a day from 260,000 barrels would require
investment of $6 billion to $10 billion, Bahrain’s Oil Minister
Abdul Hussain Ali Mirza said on May 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
