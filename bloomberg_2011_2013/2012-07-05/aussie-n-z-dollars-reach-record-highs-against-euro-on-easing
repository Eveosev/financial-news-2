The Australian and New Zealand
dollars rose to record highs against the euro after the  European
Central Bank  joined the People’s Bank of  China  and the  Bank of
England  in increasing stimulus to boost economic growth.  The Aussie strengthened against all but one of its 16 most-
traded peers as Chinese policy makers cut their key  interest
rate  for the second time in a month. New Zealand’s dollar gained
to the highest level against its U.S. counterpart in two months.
The ECB lowered its benchmark rate to a record 0.75 percent, and
the BOE expanded its asset-purchase stimulus program by 50
billion pounds ($78 billion) to 375 billion pounds.  “The global central-bank response has been positive for
risk assets and commodities because central banks continue their
commitment to the stabilization of financial markets
generally,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at
Bank of  Nova Scotia  in Toronto. “That provides some reassurance
to investors.”  Australia’s dollar climbed 1.2 percent to A$1.2045 per euro
yesterday in New York, after touching A$1.2022 earlier, the
strongest since the 17-nation currency was created in 1999. The
Aussie rose 0.1 percent to $1.0287 and gained 0.2 percent to
82.22 yen.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, appreciated 1.1
percent against the euro to NZ$1.5422 after reaching a record
NZ$1.5382. It was little changed at 80.35 U.S. cents. The kiwi
traded at 64.22 yen.  Top Partner  China remained Australia’s top trading partner in May, with
transactions climbing to A$11.1 billion ($11.4 billion), the
most since October, according to figures released yesterday by
the  Australian Bureau of Statistics .  Exports to China climbed to A$7.3 billion in May, the
report showed. That’s the most ever in data compiled by
Bloomberg dating back to 1988.  New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said China may
eventually surpass Australia as his country’s biggest export
market as Asia’s economies drive growth while Europe struggles.  New  Zealand’s free-trade agreement with China has been
“hugely successful” since it was signed in 2008, Key said in
response to a question after a speech in Sydney yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
