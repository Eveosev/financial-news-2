U.K. stocks  closed little changed as
an increase in  Bank of England ’s bond-purchase target and
interest-rate cuts in Europe and China offset concern that
economic risks persist in the euro area.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  gained 3.1 percent, leading mining shares
higher.  GKN Plc (GKN) , a U.K. maker of components for Airbus SAS
jetliners, surged the most in three years after agreeing to buy
Volvo AB’s aircraft-engine unit. Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc fell.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 0.1 percent to 5,692.63 in London.
The gauge fluctuated between advance and decline at least 12
times. The broader FTSE All-Share Index climbed less than 0.1
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 0.1 percent.  “Shares in London did have something of a post-lunch
wobble,” said  David Jones , chief market strategist at IG Index
in London. “It’s testament to how positive sentiment is that
much of these losses have been clawed back.”  The  equity benchmark  has advanced 2.2 percent so far this
week as measures of manufacturing from China to the euro area
beat forecasts and speculation grew that central banks will take
further steps to stimulate growth.  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee led by
Governor  Mervyn King  raised its asset-purchase target by 50
billion pounds ($78 billion) to 375 billion pounds. Thirty out
of 41 economists had forecast the move in a Bloomberg News
survey. Policy makers also left their benchmark rate at a record
low of 0.5 percent today.  China, ECB  The People’s Bank of China reduced the one-year deposit
rate by 25 basis points and the one-year lending rate by 31
basis points.  The  European Central Bank  lowered its main refinancing rate
and the deposit rate by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent and zero
respectively.  Stocks earlier erased gains after ECB President  Mario Draghi  said some “downside risks” to the euro-area economic
outlook have materialized. “Economic growth in the euro area
continues to remain weak with heightened uncertainty weighing on
both confidence and sentiment.”  “The global economy is in a very poor state, and investors
are starting to realize that monetary policy is reaching its
limits,” said  Michael Hewson , a market analyst at CMC Markets
U.K. Plc in London. “There’s only so much central banks can do
when the problems within the global economy are structural.”  U.S. Payrolls  Companies in the U.S. added 176,000 workers in June,
according to figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Employer Services. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 100,000 advance.  A gauge of mining shares listed on the FTSE 350 Index
advanced 0.8 percent today.  Xstrata climbed 3.1 percent to 845.8 pence after obtaining
permission to adjourn a shareholder meeting due July 12 to
approve its merger with  Glencore International Plc. (GLEN)  Xstrata is
changing the terms of management retention awards in response to
shareholder demands.  Glencore added 1.1 percent to 315.6 pence and Kazakhmys Plc
climbed 0.9 percent to 758 pence.  GKN surged 13 percent to 211 pence, the most since May
2009, after saying it will pay 633 million pounds to buy Volvo’s
aircraft-engine unit to tap demand for lightweight composite
parts and narrow the gap with competitors such as Safran SA.  Dunelm Group Plc (DNLM)  gained 3.7 percent to 531 pence after
saying it sees full-year pretax profit at about 96 million
pounds, higher than analysts’ estimate of 92 million pounds.  Tate & Lyle Plc (TATE)  rose 1.6 percent to 666.5 pence after Exane
BNP Paribas raised its recommendation on the shares to
outperform, the equivalent of buy, from neutral.  A gauge of banking shares listed on the FTSE 350 Index
retreated 0.4 percent.  RBS lost 3.4 percent to 207.2 pence, while Lloyds slid 2.7
percent to 30.82 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
