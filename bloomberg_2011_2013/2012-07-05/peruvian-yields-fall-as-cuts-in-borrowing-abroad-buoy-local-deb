Peruvian bonds rose, pushing yields
down the most in three days, as interest-rate reductions in
Europe and  China  boosted the appeal of the Andean nation’s
fixed-rate assets.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due in August 2020 fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.96 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price increased 0.22 centimo to 118.93
centimos per sol.  The U.S. Federal Reserve may take further steps before the
end of the year to stimulate growth after extending last month
its program of selling shorter-term debt and buying longer
maturities to reduce borrowing costs, said Felipe Hernandez,
analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Stamford,
 Connecticut .  “With all that liquidity, people will start looking for
assets to invest in,” Hernandez said in a phone interview.
“There’s room for foreign investors to add to their holdings of
local currency government bonds. Yields in Peru are still
relatively attractive compared with other Latin American
countries.”  The sol fell 0.2 percent to 2.6495 per dollar at today’s
close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The central
bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the  spot market  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
