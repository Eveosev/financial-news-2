Tiger Woods , seeking his fourth win
of the season, began the U.S. PGA Tour’s Greenbrier Classic with
a 1-over-par 71, eight shots off the lead.  Vijay Singh  leads the tournament in White Sulphur Springs,
West Virginia, at 7 under. Singh birdied six of his final eight
holes and leads Jeff Maggert by a stroke as first-round play
continues.  Beginning play on the 10th hole, Woods reached 2 under par
with birdies on the 11th and 12th holes before a bogey on the
13th and a double-bogey on the 17th, where he hit his tee shot
into a creek on the right side.  He had two birdies and two bogeys over the final nine
holes.  Woods, who won last week’s AT&T National tournament to
surpass  Jack Nicklaus  with 74 victories, is eight wins shy of
matching  Sam Snead ’s record 82 PGA Tour wins.  Woods is playing in the 3-year-old Greenbrier event for the
first time. Snead was the head professional at the Greenbrier
Resort from the late 1930s until his death in 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
