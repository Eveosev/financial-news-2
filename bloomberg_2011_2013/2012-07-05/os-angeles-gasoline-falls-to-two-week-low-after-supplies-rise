Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles  weakened
to a two-week low against futures after the Energy Department
said inventories of the motor fuel on the U.S. West Coast
increased for the fourth time in five weeks.  Regional  gasoline supplies  rose 2.7 percent to 27.9 million
barrels in the week ended June 29, the report showed. Gasoline
inventories in  California  gained 8.4 percent to 6.1 million
barrels after refineries boosted  non-California-blend gasoline
stocks , for use outside the state, by 79 percent, the state
Energy Commission said.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in Los Angeles fell
4.25 cents to a discount of 1.75 cents a gallon against gasoline
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:01 p.m.
East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s
the first time the fuel has traded below futures since June 21.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is nearing the end of a 40-day
maintenance turnaround at the 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance

with knowledge of the timing said May 11. The refinery plans to
flare gases through July 9, Exxon said in a regulatory notice.  Carbob in San Francisco dropped 4.75 cents to 3.75 cents a
gallon below futures, also its lowest level since June 21.  Refineries in California cut  Carbob supplies  3.8 percent
last week to 4.62 million barrels and increased non-Carbob
inventories to 1.48 million barrels from 828,000 a week earlier,
the state Energy Commission said in an e-mailed report.  CARB Diesel  California-blend diesel, or CARB diesel, in Los Angeles
fell 0.12 cent to a premium of 4.63 cents a gallon against Nymex
heating oil futures. The same fuel in  San Francisco  dropped 1
cent to parity with futures.  CARB diesel supplies  climbed 1.6 percent last week to 2.17
million barrels, the state Energy Commission said.  Non-CARB

percent to 1 million barrels, the state said.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
weakened 2 cents to a premium of 1 cent a gallon against
gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel  there  was unchanged at an 8-
cent-a-gallon premium to heating oil futures.  Low-sulfur diesel fuel inventories  in the West Coast
slipped 2.5 percent to 10.5 million barrels last week, the
Energy Department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
