Romanians are protesting before a
parliamentary vote tomorrow on suspending President Traian Basescu, with his opponents and supporters gathering in the
streets of Bucharest.  About 2,000 people rallied after a call from the opposition
Liberal-Democrats to back Basescu, according to  Mediafax  news
service. A few hundred people protested against him in the same
spot where January protests turned violent and led to the
resignation of former Prime Minister Emil Boc.  Basescu, embroiled in a struggle with Prime Minister Victor
Ponta over policy, is facing parliamentary suspension that may
lead to his ouster if confirmed in a referendum. Pontaâ€™s Social
Democrats and the Liberals are accusing Basescu of breaching the
Constitution and overstepping his duties after announcing wage
cuts and tax increases in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
