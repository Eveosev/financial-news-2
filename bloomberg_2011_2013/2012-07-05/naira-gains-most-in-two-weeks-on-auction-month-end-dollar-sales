Nigeria ’s naira strengthened the most
in two weeks after the central bank and oil companies sold
dollars.  The currency of  Africa ’s top oil producer appreciated 0.5
percent to 162.1050 per dollar in the  interbank market  as of
3:29 p.m. in Lagos, the biggest gain on a closing basis since
June 18.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $251 million at a foreign-
currency auction yesterday, bringing its total sales this week
to $601 million naira compared with $700 million the previous
week. Oil-producing companies that sell dollars around the
month-end to meet local expenses are the second major supplier
after the bank.  “The naira is reacting to an increase in dollar supply by
the central bank as well as sales of an undisclosed amount by
 oil companies  engaged in their usual month-end supply,” Sewa
Wusu, currency analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd.,
said in an interview today.  The central bank held the  benchmark interest rate  at 12
percent this year to curb the naira’s decline and combat
inflation, after raising it 5.75 percentage points in 2011.  While  inflation  slowed to 12.7 percent in May from 12.9
percent in April, the rate is set to peak at 14.5 percent in the
third quarter, the highest since April 2010, according to the
central bank.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic 15.1 percent bonds due 2017
rose six basis points to 16.06 percent, according to July 4 data
on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on
the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 was unchanged at
5.517 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated for the first time in three days,
down 0.4 percent to 1.9475 per dollar in Accra, the weakest
level since at least 1993, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
