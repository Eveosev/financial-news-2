The Bovespa index rose for a fifth
day after  China ,  Brazil ’s main trading partner, and the  European
Central Bank  cut  interest rates  to shore up growth, boosting the
outlook for the South American country’s exports.  Oil companies  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and iron-ore producer
 Vale SA (VALE) , the two heaviest-weighted stocks on the equity gauge,
contributed the most to the advance. Steelmaker  Gerdau SA (GGBR4)  rose
to a two-month high.  The Bovespa gained 0.5 percent to 56,379.06 at the close in
Sao Paulo. The real rose 0.2 percent to 2.0250 per  U.S. dollar 
at 5:19 p.m. local time. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24
raw materials climbed 0.4 percent after rising as much as 0.9
percent. Commodities producers account for about 42 percent of
the Bovespa’s weighting.  “China’s decision signals the country’s government is
committed to stimulate the economy, which should help to
maintain Brazilian raw-materials exports at a good level,”
Marcos Pessoa, an economist at the brokerage Renascenca, said in
a phone interview from  Sao Paulo .  The one-year lending rate in China will fall by 31 basis
points and the one-year deposit rate will drop by 25 basis
points effective tomorrow. The European Central Bank lowered its
main refinancing rate to a record low 0.75 percent from 1
percent, as predicted in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Global Growth View  Reports showing fewer workers in the U.S. filed for
unemployment insurance payments and American companies added
more workers than forecast helped to improve the global growth
scenario, Eduardo Velho, chief economist at Planner Prosper,
said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Applications for U.S. jobless benefits fell 14,000 in the
week ended June 30 to 374,000, Labor Department figures showed
today. Private employers expanded payrolls by 176,000 last
month, according to figures released by Roseland, New Jersey-
based ADP Employer Services, exceeding the most optimistic
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Petrobras, as the state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro is
known, rose 3.4 percent to 19.60 reais. Vale advanced 1.2
percent to 40.50 reais, the highest since May 3. Gerdau SA
gained 2.8 percent to 18.13 reais.  The Bovespa earlier dropped as much as 0.4 percent as
stocks in the U.S. and  Europe  fell after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  told reporters that today’s cut in
interest rates may have only a limited impact on the euro-area
economy as it slides toward recession.  ‘Confidence Eroded’  “As the market’s confidence eroded in the past months, it
gets harder for any action regarding monetary policy to work,”
Velho said.  Retailer Cia. Hering tumbled 2.8 percent to 38.04 reais.
Brewer  Cia. de Bebidas das Americas  dropped 1.4 percent to 77.90
reais.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge has fallen 18 percent since
this year’s high on March 13 as the debt crisis in Europe
worsened and growth in Brazil faltered. The index trades at 10
times analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.3 times for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 6.48 billion reais ($3.2 billion) in
stocks in Sao Paulo today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with a daily average of 7.35 billion
reais this year through July 4, according to data from the
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
