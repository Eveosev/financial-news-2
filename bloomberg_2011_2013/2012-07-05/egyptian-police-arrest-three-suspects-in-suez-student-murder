Egyptian authorities arrested three
suspects in the murder of a university student in Suez as he sat
with his fiancee in a garden, the state-run Middle East News
Agency reported today.  The attack on 20-year-old Ahmed Eid in the port city of
Suez led to his death on July 1, a day after the Muslim
Brotherhood’s Mohamed Mursi was sworn in as  Egypt ’s first
civilian president. Authorities say the victim was attacked in a
park after the men approached him and asked him about his
relationship to the woman.  Egypt’s Islamist groups, who have been viewed with a
measure of suspicion and fear by secularists and the country’s
Christian minority since the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak  last year,
distanced themselves from the attack, which was widely reported
by local media. The Muslim Brotherhood issued a statement on its
website condemning the incident.  Interior Ministry officials said they haven’t linked the
murder to any mainstream Islamic groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
