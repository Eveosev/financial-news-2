Former  France Telecom SA (FTE)  Chief
Executive Officer Didier Lombard was charged as part of an
investigation into employee suicides and depression.  Lombard was charged with mental harassment in the
investigation into a complaint by a labor union that France
Telecom’s reorganization contributed to psychological issues,
said  Jean Veil , his lawyer.  France Telecom suspended its restructuring plans in 2009
and Lombard stepped down as CEO in 2010 after more than 30
people killed themselves as the company struggled to cope with
intensifying competition. Most of the workers when Lombard left
had protected status that made it difficult to fire them and the
company instead gave employees meaningless jobs to force them
out, driving some to take their own lives, the unions said.  “At no point were these plans conceived and put in place
by France Telecom directed against employees,” Lombard wrote in
a statement published on the Le Monde website yesterday. “They
were meant to save the company and its employees, and to open up
new career paths in the new digital world.”  France Telecom  will go before the judge leading the inquiry
tomorrow, Estelle Ode-Coutard, a spokeswoman, said today,
calling the appearance a “normal” part of the investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
