The  United Nations , faced with a
dearth of donors, pitched a tax on billionaires to help raise
money for development projects in the world’s poorest nations.  Placing a 1 percent levy on “individual wealth holdings”
of at least $1 billion could raise as much as $50 billion,
according to the UN’s World Economic and Social Survey published
today.  The proposal to target the world’s wealthiest citizens
comes amid a global economic slowdown that has left donor
nations tightening budgets and forced the UN to look for more
inventive ways to raise as much as $400 billion toward
development assistance. The UN has no taxing powers, so any such
tax would be up to the individual member nations.  “The ’average’ billionaire would own $3.7 billion after
paying the tax,” according to the report. “If that billionaire
spent $1,000 per day, it would take him or her over 10,000 years
to spend all his or her wealth. Would this hurt them?”  The report said a billionaires’ tax proposal -- on a list
of “innovative sources” of development finance -- “is not yet
in any international agenda.”  The UN report says there are more than 1,200 billionaires
worldwide, of which at least 425 are in the U.S., 315 in  Asia 
and 310 in  Europe . Their combined worth is about $4.6 trillion
dollars, according to the report.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
