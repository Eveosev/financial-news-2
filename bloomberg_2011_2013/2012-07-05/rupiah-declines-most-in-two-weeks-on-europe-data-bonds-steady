Indonesia’s rupiah declined the most
in more than a week after data showed services output in Europe
slowed, damping demand for emerging-market assets.  Government
bonds  advanced.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  snapped six days of gains after
reports showed services output in the euro area shrank for a
fifth month in June, unexpectedly contracted in  Germany  and
increased less than estimated in the U.K. Economists predict the
 European Central Bank  will reduce borrowing costs when it meets
for a policy meeting today.  “There were a number of unfavorable data from Europe,
turning the market wary,” said Putu Andi Wijaya, a foreign-
exchange dealer at PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia in Jakarta. “We
need to see if foreign investors halt their recent inflows to
the stock and bond markets, which would soften the rupiah.”  The rupiah weakened 0.2 percent to 9,385 per dollar as of
4:56 p.m. in Jakarta, the most since June 26, prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility,
which measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, held
at 8.25 percent.  Global funds added 2.48 trillion rupiah ($265 million) to
their government bond holdings this week through July 3 and
bought $165 million more local stocks than they sold so far this
week,  finance ministry  and exchange data show.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.04
percent, the lowest level since May 3, according to prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
