Patrick Perret-Green, Singapore-based
head of Asia foreign-exchange and rates strategy at  Citigroup
Inc. (C) , comments on China’s second interest-rate cut within a
month, in a report published today.  “Clearly, the government is concerned about growth and the
30 percent allowable discount is very aggressive. It was
previously 20 percent.  ‘‘Theoretically, a bank could lend at 4.2 percent now. So,
in theory, from where we were just a few weeks ago, the price of
a one-year loan has fallen 240 basis points. This is likely to
push the seven-day repo below 2 percent, to where it was before
the tightening cycle began.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
