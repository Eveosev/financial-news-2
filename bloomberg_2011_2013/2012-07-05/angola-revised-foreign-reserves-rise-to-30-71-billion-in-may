Angola ’s net foreign-currency
reserves rose to a revised $30.71 billion in May from $28.54
billion a month earlier, the country’s central bank said in a
statement on its  website  today.  The Luanda-based Banco Nacional de Angola revised its
foreign-currency reserve figures for May and April since
Bloomberg News obtained a preliminary central bank document on
its foreign reserves on June 18.  The foreign-currency reserves are at the highest since at
least Dec. 2009, according to data published on the Banco
Nacional de Angola’s website. Oil exports from Angola,  Africa ’s
biggest producer after Nigeria, account for more than 90 percent
of the country’s foreign-currency earnings, according to the
 World Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
