Rubber declined for the first time in
four days as oil retreated from a one-month high in  New York ,
reducing the appeal of the commodity as an alternative to
synthetic products used to make tires.  December-delivery rubber lost as much as 1.8 percent to
252.1 yen a kilogram ($3,159 a metric ton), before trading at
252.6 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 2:30 p.m. The most-
active contract has lost 4.1 percent this year.  Oil fell in New York amid speculation that fuel demand may
decline on signs Europe’s economy is weakening after Germany’s
services industries unexpectedly shrank last month.  Asian stocks 
dropped, snapping a six-day winning streak, before German data
forecast to show factory orders declined.  “Weak economic data from Europe reduced investor appetite
for commodities,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research
company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said today by phone. “Rubber was
sold in tandem with oil and metals.”  Losses in futures were limited amid expectations that the
 European Central Bank  and the  Bank of England  will ease monetary
policy, reviving demand for commodities, he said.  The ECB will probably cut its benchmark  interest rate  by 25
basis points to a record low 0.75 percent today, while the BOE
is forecast to raise its target for bond purchases, according to
economists in Bloomberg News surveys.  Rubber for September delivery fell 0.3 percent to 23,845
 yuan  ($3,753) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber  free-on-board  dropped 1 percent to 102.55 baht ($3.25) a
kilogram, according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  Thailand’s Rubber Estate Organization raised  the price  at
which it buys ribbed-smoked sheets from farmers by 1.1 percent
to 96.20 baht a kilogram today. That’s higher than the average
auctioned price in three southern markets of 93.20 baht.  To contact the reporters on this story:
