OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA’s
shares may jump 181 percent in the next 12 months after a plunge
last week brought the stock to an “appealing” price, Banco BTG
Pactual said.  Shares in the oil company controlled by billionaire Eike
Batista may reach 17.63 reais in the next 12 months, BTG
Pactual’s analyst Gustavo Gattass wrote in a note to clients
today. The stock closed at 6.28 reais yesterday.  OGX plunged 41 percent last week, the biggest slump on
record, after saying it plans to stabilize production at each of
its first two wells at the Tubarao Azul field in the Campos
Basin at 5,000 barrels a day, down from a previous plan to pump
as much as 20,000 barrels daily at each well.  “OGX has enough cash to support its business,” Gattass
wrote. “We believe that from the selloff and in spite of the
new outlook there has come an appealing value.”  The stock gained 3 percent to 6.47 reais at 10:38 a.m. in
Sao Paulo today. The benchmark Bovespa index gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
