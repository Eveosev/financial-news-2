A Chinese orphanage director was
removed after photos emerged online showing a child chained to a
bench and another restrained with cloth strips.  An eight-year-old boy was chained by the ankle because he
had schizophrenia and was violent, while a boy who was deaf and
mute, taken into the orphanage as a baby in 2010, was tied up
around the neck because of his epilepsy, the Cangnan county
Communist Party said in a July 1  statement  posted on the
government news portal.  The government in Cangnan, in the eastern province of
Zhejiang, is investigating allegations of dereliction of duty,
according to a separate county government statement on July 2.
It was the second time in the last two months that photos posted
online spurred a local government to take action, after images
appeared of a woman lying next to the seven-month-old fetus she
was forced to abort.  “Reports of using iron chains to lock up a boy are true
after verifications from the Cangnan County Civil Affairs
Bureau,” the county’s Communist Party Committee said in its
statement.  Nineteen of the 21 children at the orphanage are physically
or mentally disabled and another nine staff have been hired,
according to the statements. Construction of a new orphanage has
also been sped up, the statements said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
