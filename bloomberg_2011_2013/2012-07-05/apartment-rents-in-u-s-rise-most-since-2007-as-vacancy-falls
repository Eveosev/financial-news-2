Apartment rents in the U.S. climbed
the most in almost five years in the second quarter as shrinking
vacancies allowed landlords to charge more,  Reis Inc. (REIS)  said.  Effective rents, or what tenants paid after landlord
giveaways are included, rose to an average $1,041 a month from
$1,028 in the first quarter and $1,006 a year earlier, the New
York-based real estate research firm said in a report today. The
1.3 percent gain from the previous three months was the biggest
since the third quarter of 2007, before the recession began.  Demand for apartments has jumped as insufficient income or
bad credit deter many Americans from purchasing homes, while
others prefer the flexibility of leasing. The national apartment
vacancy rate fell to 4.7 percent in the second quarter, the
lowest since the end of 2001. The rate was 4.9 percent in the
first quarter and 5.9 percent a year earlier.  “For most markets, once vacancies tighten below 5 percent,
effective rents tend to spike,” Ryan Severino, senior economist
at Reis, said in the report. “It appears that rents are
beginning to accelerate.”  Increasing construction may slow the recovery as rising
rents encourage a wave of new  apartment (BBREAPT)  development, Severino
said. While the second quarter’s new supply of 9,452 units was
“quite weak by historical standards,” Reis expects about
70,000 units to open for leasing this year, about twice the rate
of supply growth in 2011, according to the report.  Supply Surge  Next year, 150,000 to 200,000 new units will be completed
in the 79 metropolitan markets Reis tracks. In certain
submarkets, the surge in supply may hamper landlords’ ability to
push price increases, the company said.  New York  had the lowest apartment vacancy rate in the
second quarter, at 2.2 percent, Reis said. It also had the
largest increase in effective rents from the previous three
months, up 1.7 percent to an average $2,935 a month.  Six of the top 10 markets for effective-rent increases were
cities with a strong base of technology employment, including
 San Francisco  and  Seattle , Reis said.  All 79 markets had year-over-year effective-rent growth of
more than 2 percent, according to the report.  “Even the poorest-performing markets are faring relatively
well,” Severino said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
