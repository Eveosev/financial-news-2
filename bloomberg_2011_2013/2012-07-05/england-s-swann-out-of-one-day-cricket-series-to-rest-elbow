Graeme Swann will miss the final two
games of England’s one-day cricket series against Australia to
rest a sore elbow in his bowling arm.  The right-handed offspinner will be replaced by  James Tredwell  for the games in Durham in two days and July 10 in
Manchester. The injury is not expected to keep him out of the
three-Test series against South Africa, which begins July 19.  “Graeme has some pain in his elbow at the moment and we
feel that an extra week’s rest will allow his elbow to settle,”
England national selector Geoff Miller said in a statement.  Pace bowler  Chris Woakes  will also remain in the squad for
the final two games. Woakes was recalled to the squad for
yesterday’s third game, which was rained out in Birmingham.  England has a 2-0 lead and will clinch its seventh straight
one-day series win with another victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
