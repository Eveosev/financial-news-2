Porsche SE’s bonds rose the most in
more than four months after  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  agreed to buy the 50.1
percent stake in the sports carmaker’s automotive business that
it doesn’t already own.  Porsche’s 3.875 percent notes due 2016 rose 1.38 cents to
107.39 cents on the euro, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices at 11:45 a.m. in London. That’s the largest intra day
move since February 14, when the bonds jumped 5.22 percent after
plummeting 5.04 percent the previous day.  The yield relative on the securities to the benchmark swap
rate fell 36 basis points to 82 basis points, the lowest since
April 10, the data show. That compares with an average 139
basis-point spread for European auto companies, including
Peugeot SA and Daimler AG, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Euro
Automotive Index shows.  The 4.46 billion-euro ($5.6 billion) cash deal ends a
seven-year saga that divided two of  Germany ’s most powerful
families. The two companies agreed to combine three years ago
after Stuttgart-based Porsche racked up more than 10 billion
euros of debt in a failed attempt to take over Volkswagen,
 Europe ’s largest carmaker.  The cost of insuring Porsche’s bonds against losses for
five years also fell with credit-default swaps dropping 13 basis
points to 147, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
renege on debt agreements.  Porsche also said it will use part of the 4.46 billion
euros to repay 2 billion euros of bank debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
