Sugar traders are the most bullish in
six months after prices moved to within five percentage points
of exiting a year-long  bear market  as rain delayed cane
processing in Brazil, the biggest producer.  Nine of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg said they expect
raw sugar to keep rallying next week and two were bearish, the
highest proportion of bulls since Jan. 6. Futures reached an 11-
week high of 22.69 cents a pound in  New York  yesterday.  Hedge
funds  increased  wagers  on rising prices by 29 percent to the
highest since April in the week ended June 26, U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show.  The sweetener has been in a bear market since September as
forecasters from Rabobank International to Macquarie Group Ltd.
predicted a third annual glut. Prices rallied 15 percent since
the start of June after above-average rainfall in  Brazil ’s main
growing region increased concern about shortages. Copersucar SA,
which owns mills in the country, said July 2 it took delivery of
about 112,000 metric tons of raw sugar against the ICE Futures
U.S. exchange’s expired July contract.  “The sugar turnaround has been fast because the short-term
supply issues in Brazil are bullish,” said Keith Flury, an
analyst at Rabobank in  London . “We are in a weather market.”  Raw sugar is still 6.7 percent lower since the start of the
year at 21.74 cents by 4:44 p.m. in London, extending a 27
percent retreat in 2011. If it closes at that price today, it
would be a 15 percent gain since June 4.  Brazil Production  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agriculture  Index (MXWD)  of eight
commodities rose 8 percent after grain prices rallied because a
U.S. heat wave is wilting crops. The MSCI All-Country World
Index of equities advanced 3.7 percent and Treasuries returned 2
percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Brazil’s center south, which normally accounts for about 90
percent of the country’s output, will produce 485 million tons
of cane in the 12 months through March 31, Macquarie reported
June 11, cutting its previous estimate of 500 million tons. Rain
forecast for today and the weekend will probably further delay
harvesting until July 10, Somar Meteorologia, a Sao Paulo-based
weather forecaster, reported July 2.  Sugar production in Brazil slid to a three-year low of 36.2
million tons in the 12 months that ended April 30, according to
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . While the agency anticipates
a third annual gain in global stockpiles, it is also forecasting
record consumption of 163 million tons. Demand expanded every
year since 1995, USDA data show.  China Shipments  China , the third-biggest user after  India  and the European
Union, may import the most in 17 years in the 12 months ending
in September as the government replenishes stockpiles, according
to the median of eight trader and analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg last month. Shipments may jump 43 percent to 3 million
tons.  The options market is also signaling a more bullish
outlook. Daily trading volumes for the option conferring the
right to buy at 22 cents by late September averaged about 21
contracts in the four months through April, ICE Futures U.S.
data show. That jumped to 4,213 contracts on June 21 and was
2,581 on July 3. The price of the security climbed more than
tripled in the past month.  Sugar slumped 40 percent since reaching a 30-year high of
36.08 cents in February 2011 as farmers from  Thailand  to Brazil
planted more cane. Global output will exceed demand by 5.8
million tons in the season ending in September, compared with
about 500,000 tons a year earlier, Macquarie estimates. The bank
predicts that will narrow to 2.8 million tons in 2012-13.  Sucrose Content  Prices rose to a six-month high of 31.85 cents in August
2011 because of disruptions to Brazil’s harvest. The size of the
anticipated glut may mean that won’t be repeated this time.  “The big difference this year is we were not in much of a
surplus last year, but this year we are,” said  Kona Haque , an
analyst at Macquarie in London. While rain reduces the sucrose
content of cane, the return of dry weather would limit the
impact and mills could keep processing beyond the normal end of
the season in November, she said.  In other commodities, 18 of 27 traders and analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expect gold to climb next week and three
were neutral. Futures on the Comex exchange in New York are up
1.4 percent since the start of January at $1,588.10 an ounce.
Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded products reached a
record 2,413.6 tons July 5, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Twelve of 26 people surveyed said copper will decline next
week and 10 predicted gains. The metal for delivery in three
months, the London Metal Exchange’s benchmark contract, fell 0.9
percent this year to $7,535 a ton.  Dry Weather  Corn and soybeans traders are bullish for an 11th week on
concern that hot, dry weather in the U.S. Midwest will hurt
crops. Seventeen of 29 people surveyed anticipate higher prices
for both commodities next week and 10 were bearish. Corn rose
7.5 percent to $6.95 a bushel this year as soybeans climbed 25
percent to $15.1675 a bushel.  The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities jumped 8.5 percent
since closing at a 20-month low on June 21 as European leaders
moved to contain the region’s debt crisis and central banks
worldwide sought to shore up growth.  China said yesterday it will cut benchmark  interest rates 
for the second time in a month from today. The  European Central
Bank  cut rates to a record-low 0.75 percent from 1 percent and
the  Bank of England  restarted bond purchases two months after
halting its expansion of stimulus. Federal Reserve policy makers
are scheduled to announce a rate decision Aug. 1.  “Stimulus expectations, with primary focus on the ECB cut,
took over from post European Union summit optimism early this
week and have been driving commodity prices higher,” said Filip Petersson, an analyst at SEB AB in  Stockholm . “To keep markets
optimistic, we need more than stimulus efforts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
