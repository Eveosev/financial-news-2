Mexico ’s bird flu outbreak, which has
infected more than 500,000 chickens, won’t curb earnings from
Industrias Bachoco SAB, the country’s largest poultry producer,
a company official said.  None of Bachoco’s facilities located “within the
quarantined zone are commercial layer farms,” said Claudia
Cabrera, a company spokeswoman. Bachoco has breeder farms in the
affected zone, though it hasn’t detected any bird flu cases,
Cabrera said, without elaborating on the number of farms.  Bachoco’s earnings won’t be affected by the outbreak
“because our egg production is located in other states,” she
said in a telephone interview today.  The World Organization for  Animal Health  estimates that
14.4 million birds in western Mexico are at risk of contagion
from the virus H7N3, according to a statement from the Paris-
based organization yesterday. Mexico’s  Agriculture Ministry 
increased the quarantined area to a 40-kilometer (25 miles)
radius from the first cases.  Pilgrim’s Pride, controlled by Brazil’s  JBS SA (JBSS3) , said it
doesn’t have any farms in the quarantined area, according to an
e-mailed statement sent to Bloomberg News today.  Japan is banning poultry imports from Mexico after the bird
flu outbreak,  Kyodo News  said on its  website  June 27.  Bachoco’s  American depositary receipts , each representing
12 ordinary shares, fell 2.1 percent, to $21.51 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York. They have risen 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
