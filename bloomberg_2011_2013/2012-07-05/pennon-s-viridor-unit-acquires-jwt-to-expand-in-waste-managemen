Pennon Group Plc (PNN) , a U.K. water
provider, said its Viridor Waste Management Ltd. subsidiary
acquired JWT Holdings Ltd. for 7.6 million pounds ($12 million)
including debt to expand in waste collection and recycling.  The purchase of the waste management and recycling business
“provides excellent synergies with Viridor’s existing
activities in Manchester and across the northwest,” Viridor
Chief Executive Officer Colin Drummond said today in a
statement.  The deal compliments five acquisitions for about 40 million
pounds since 2011 “and Viridor’s development of the U.K.’s
largest waste-fired conbined heat and power facility at
Runcorn,” the chief executive said.  Pennon shares have risen 6.8 percent in London trading over
the past year. Pennon is based in Exeter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
