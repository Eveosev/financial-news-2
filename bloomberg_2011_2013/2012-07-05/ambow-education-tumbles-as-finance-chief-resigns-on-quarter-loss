Ambow Education Holding Ltd. (AMBO)  fell to
the lowest on record in New York after the Beijing-based
education service provider’s Chief Financial Officer resigned
and the company reported a first-quarter net loss.  Ambow Education tumbled 20 percent to $3.73 at the close of
trading in New York, the lowest since the American depositary
receipts started trading in August 2010. Trading was almost
three times the stock’s three-month average daily volume,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In a statement yesterday, Ambow Education reported a $12.7
million net loss for the first quarter, compared with $2 million
net income for the same period in 2011. In a separate statement,
the Beijing-based company said Gareth Kung, who joined the
company in December, resigned as the company’s finance chief,
and that KJ Tan, vice-president of finance, was appointed as
acting finance chief.  Ambow Education, in a  filing  to the Securities and Exchange
Commission today, also said it will conduct an internal
investigation in response to an allegation by a former employee
of “financial impropriety and wrongful conduct” related to the
2008 acquisition of a training school.  To contact the reporter on this story:
