The euro slid to the lowest level in
more than a month versus the dollar after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said the currency bloc still faces risks
after policy makers cut  interest rates  to a record low.  The shared currency weakened against all of its 16 most-
traded peers except the Swiss franc and the Danish krone,
dropping to the lowest against  Australia ’s dollar since 1999.
The ECB cut its benchmark  rate  to 0.75 percent and reduced its
deposit rate to zero for the first time. The  Dollar Index  jumped
the most in almost eight months as reports showed U.S. labor-
market improvement.  “The source of the weakness can be put down to Draghi’s
comments,”  Richard Franulovich , a New York-based senior
currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp., said in a
telephone interview. “He didn’t really offer much in the way of
fresh proposals. Not only was he non-committal, he was also
pretty negative about these things happening again.”  The European currency fell against the dollar for a second
day, dropping 1.1 percent to $1.2392 at 5 p.m.  New York  time and
touching $1.2364, the weakest level since June 1. The common
currency depreciated 1 percent to 99.03 yen. The greenback was
little changed at 79.92 yen.  The euro slid to the lowest against the Aussie since the
17-nation currency was created in January 1999, A$1.2022, after
Draghi’s comments. It rose earlier to A$1.2229. The Aussie
gained 0.1 percent $1.0287 after rising earlier as much as 0.5
percent to $1.0329, the highest since May 3.  New Zealand’s dollar appreciated 0.5 percent to 80.76 U.S.
cents before trading little changed at 80.35 cents.  China Cut  Both South Pacific currencies reached their highs of the
day against the greenback after  China  cut its key interest rate
for the second time in a month and the  Bank of England  raised
the target in its asset-purchase stimulus program by 50 billion
pounds ($78 billion) to 375 billion pounds.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the U.S. currency against those of six major trade
partners, climbed as much as 1.4 percent, the biggest intraday
jump since Nov. 9, to 82.950 after U.S. employment reports. It
traded later at 82.793, up 1.2 percent.  ADP Employer Services, based in Roseland,  New Jersey , said
U.S. companies added 176,000 workers in June, beating a forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey for a 100,000 advance. Applications
for jobless benefits fell by 14,000 last week to 374,000, the
fewest since mid-May, Labor Department data showed. The Labor
Department will report tomorrow that U.S. payrolls added 100,000
jobs in June, another Bloomberg survey projected.  ‘Downside Risks’  The euro tumbled against the dollar as Draghi said some
“downside risks to the euro-area economic outlook have
materialized.”  “Economic growth in the euro area continues to remain weak
with heightened uncertainty,” Draghi said at a press conference
in  Frankfurt  after the ECB cut its main refinancing rate by a
quarter-percentage point and said it will no longer pay interest
on overnight deposits.  The bank refrained from announcing any additional steps to
cap debt yields in  Spain  and Italy, where borrowing costs have
climbed amid concern  Europe  has yet to resolve its debt crisis.
The yield on Spain’s  10-year debt  rose as much as 43 basis
points today, or 0.43 percentage point, to 6.84 percent, the
highest since June 29.  Spurred Speculation  “All the ECB has managed to do this morning is increase
speculation they’re going to move to further non-conventional
measures later in the year,”  Shaun Osborne , chief currency
strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s TD Securities unit, said
in a telephone interview from Toronto. “The euro’s not emerging
from this at all well.”  The cost for European banks to convert euro-denominated
payment streams into dollar-based funding increased to the most
in more than three months, according to a money-markets
indicator. The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate
banks pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was
0.67 percentage point below the euro interbank offered rate
today, the most expensive since March 6. It was 0.4 percentage
point below Euribor on May 4, the least this year.  “The rate cut today may not be the type of move that could
actually solve any major problems in the  euro zone ,” Ravi Bharadwaj, a market analyst in  Washington  at Western Union
Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co., said in a phone
interview. “The markets are very well aware of this, and the
sell-off in the euro seems to make sense because of that.”  Support Level  The shared currency’s move below its support level of
$1.2409 indicates a resumption of a bearish pattern that began
in May,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and interest-
rates technical strategy in New York at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, wrote in a note to clients today. The euro may fall to
$1.2289 and lower if it sees a “sustained break” of the
$1.2387 level, according to Curry.  Traders should buy the euro at current levels against the
dollar, according to Lloyds Banking Group Plc, and bet the
European currency will strengthen to $1.3241. They should end
the trade if the euro falls to $1.2192, Tim McCullough, a
technical strategist at Lloyds in  London , wrote in a note today.  The euro dropped 3.2 percent over the past three months
against nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, tied with the Swiss franc for the
worst performance. The greenback rose 3 percent and the yen
gained 5.5 percent.  The Swiss franc depreciated against the dollar, weakening
through 97 centimes for the first time in more than a month.
 Switzerland ’s currency declined 1.1 percent to 96.94 centimes,
after touching 97.16 centimes, the weakest level since June 1.  The pound fell for a fourth day against the greenback,
declining 0.4 percent to $1.5525. It strengthened 0.7 percent to
79.81 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
