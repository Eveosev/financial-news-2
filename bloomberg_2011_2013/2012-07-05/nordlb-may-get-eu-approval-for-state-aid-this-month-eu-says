Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale,
a state-owned German lender, may receive European Union approval
later this month for government help after bank and regional
representatives met with the regulators today.  NordLB Chief Executive Officer Gunter Dunkel and David
McAllister, premier of the German state of  Lower Saxony , met
with EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  to discuss the
aid, according to a statement by the bank.  The European Commission and NordLB “reached an agreement
in principle on the restructuring” of the bank and regulators
plan to issue a decision on July 25, Antoine Colombani, a
spokesman for the commission, said in an e-mail.  NordLB received authorization from the commission in
December for a 1.67 billion-euro ($2 billion) government
recapitalization to help it meet capital rules set by the
European Banking Authority. EU regulators must examine large
state payments to lenders that needed help during the financial
crisis and have required banks to shrink balance sheets and
change how they do business to compensate for any harm to
competition.  Colombani didn’t give details of the bank’s restructuring
plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
