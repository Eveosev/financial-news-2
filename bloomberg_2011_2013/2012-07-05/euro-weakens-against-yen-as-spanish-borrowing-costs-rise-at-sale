The euro stayed lower against the yen
after Spanish borrowing costs rose at an auction.  The 17-nation shared currency was 0.4 percent weaker at
99.71 yen as of 9:47 a.m. London time, and was little changed at
$1.2514.  Spain  sold 3 billion euros of bonds, the Bank of Spain
said, meeting the maximum target for the sale. The Treasury sold
its 10-year benchmark bond at an average yield of 6.43 percent,
compared with 6.044 percent when the securities were last sold
on June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
