Yelp Inc. (YELP)  increased the most in
almost three weeks on speculation that a smaller model of  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad could help the business-review service add users.  The  stock  rose 5.8 percent to $26.16 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest daily advance since June 15. Yelp has
gained 74 percent since its March 1 initial public offering.  An upgraded version of Apple’s software that powers the
iPhone and iPad will include Yelp’s “check-in” feature to
enable users broadcast their whereabouts to friends, according
to materials Apple distributed to developers that were reviewed
by Bloomberg last month. Apple plans to debut a smaller, cheaper
iPad by the end of the year, people familiar with the matter
said earlier this week.  “That means more traffic for Yelp,” said  Jason Helfstein ,
an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., in a telephone interview today.
“The more devices you’re built into, the more traction you
have. Yelp would be in a better position for new advertising
clients and to raise prices.”  Yelp, based in  San Francisco , operates a website that lets
users review businesses ranging from plumbers to pet shops. The
company introduced a check-in  service  for mobile phones in 2010
in an effort to help local merchants build loyalty with
customers. Integration with Apple Maps may help Yelp challenge
Foursquare Labs Inc. and Facebook Inc., two leading providers of
check-in services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
