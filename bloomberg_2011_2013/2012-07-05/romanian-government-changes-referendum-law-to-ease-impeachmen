Romania â€™s government approved a
change in the law governing referenda to ease the rules for
impeaching the president, who faces a suspension vote in
Parliament tomorrow.  The Cabinet of Prime Minister Victor Ponta today passed a
decree making an impeachment referendum valid with a majority of
participants, rather than more than 50 percent of eligible
voters, Mircea Dusa, the minister in charge of parliamentary
relations, said after a government meeting today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
