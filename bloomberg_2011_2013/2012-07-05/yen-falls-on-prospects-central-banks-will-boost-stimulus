The euro fell for a second day versus
the yen and the dollar as Spanish borrowing costs climbed at a
debt sale and amid speculation the  European Central Bank  will
cut borrowing costs at a policy meeting today.  The Australian dollar advanced after  China  cut benchmark
 interest rates  for the second time in a month. The pound erased
a decline against the dollar as the  Bank of England  said it
would extend its asset-purchase program. The yen strengthened
against all but one of its 16 major peers after the  Bank of
Japan (8301)  raised its economic evaluation of all regions for the
first time in more than two years.  “The ECB didn’t signal it will cut rates this month, but
given the situation has deteriorated substantially, I wouldn’t
be surprised if it does,” said  Lee Hardman , a foreign-exchange
strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London.
“Lower rates will reinforce the euro’s position as a funding
currency of choice. It’s going to be negative for the euro.”  The shared currency fell 0.4 percent to 99.64 yen at 12:14
p.m. London time after losing 0.5 percent yesterday. It traded
0.2 percent weaker at $1.2508. The dollar declined 0.3 percent
to 79.67 yen.  The pound was little changed at $1.5589 after dropping as
much as 0.2 percent. Austrialia’s dollar jumped 0.3 percent to
$1.0302.  Spain sold 3 billion euros of bonds, the Bank of Spain
said, meeting the maximum target for the sale. The Treasury sold
its 10-year benchmark bond at an average yield of 6.43 percent,
compared with 6.044 percent when the securities were last sold
on June 7.  The ECB will lower its  main refinancing rate  by a quarter-
percentage point from a record low of 1 percent, according to
the median estimate of 64 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.
Five economists predict a reduction to 0.5 percent, while 10
forecast no change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
