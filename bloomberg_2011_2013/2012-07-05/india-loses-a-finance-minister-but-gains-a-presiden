India's finance minister, the veteran politician  Pranab Mukherjee , 76, tendered his resignation last week after three years in office. This was his second term in that post -- he  first served  from 1982 to 1984 -- an extraordinary feat of political endurance, as well as a study in contrasts between the challenges of running the economy in pre- and post-liberalization India. There was no whiff of controversy or taint of scandal about Mukherjee's sudden departure. Nor could it be said, though, that he left on a high.  India's economy  has been on a  rocky road  recently. But if all goes well, Mukherjee should be jobless no longer than three weeks. That's because he is  now the candidate  proposed by the Indian National Congress, the party he has served loyally for more than four decades, for the post of  president . The presidential elections are  July 19 , and Mukherjee, a politician who commands respect across political divides, is set to comfortably hold off his rival for the post,  PA Sangma . Mukherjee would also bring a much more impressive resume to  an office  often thought to be mainly ceremonial -- but one with  considerable power  -- than the outgoing president, Pratibha Patil. She was nominated by the Congress in 2007 partly because she is a woman (and no woman had held the post before) and partly because, as  one scribe put it , she suffered from a deficit of ambition and was content to be "a middle-ranking party leader and a Nehru-Gandhi loyalist." She leaves without having supplied very much else to add to that description. Mukherjee's political career, however, reveals no want of ambition. Indeed, he would now be high on a list of the best prime ministers  India  never had. There is something tragic, therefore, about his being shunted out of a policy-making environment when he clearly still had much to offer, even if Mukherjee himself seemed happy with the switch. On the Economist's Asia blog,  Banyan , it was noted that Mukherjee had at long last settled for achieving "his second-highest ambition." Even if the current UPA coalition government were to return to power in the next general elections in 2014 -- a possibility that at this moment seems unlikely -- the prime minister's post would likely go to Rahul Gandhi, the son of Congress President  Sonia Gandhi . He is the most privileged beneficiary of Indian democracy's pronounced  dynastic turn  over the last three decades that began with the wave of sympathy after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984 brought into power  her son , the political neophyte  Rajiv Gandhi , Rahul's father. (About a third of elected members of Parliament in the current Lok Sabha have a family background in politics.) As  the Economist  pointed out, Mukherjee was a contender for the post of prime minister in 1984, too -- and was ignored: A complementary perspective on the fascinating nuances of Mukherjee's position against the frames of history and the future was supplied in Tehelka by Ashok Malik, who  wrote last month : And the veteran journalist  MJ Akbar , probably India's most insightful and readable political columnist, had some trenchant observations in an article called " The Dilemma of Departure " about Mukherjee's perceived failures as finance minister and his successor to the post. That man is Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh , who was responsible for the  liberalization of India's economy  in 1991, when he served as finance minister. But Swaminathan S. Aiyar, writer of the popular column "Swaminomics" in the Times of India,  was skeptical  that the new finance minister, even if he was also the head of the Cabinet, would be able to push through crucial economic reforms that ran against the prevailing bias towards welfarism favored by Sonia and  Rahul Gandhi  (neither of whom have ever presented a coherent statement of their policy preferences): So Mukherjee moves on from four decades in active politics as a congressman to a more detached role, far from the jousting of Parliament and the heat and dust of the hustings -- but for how long? As Siddharth Varadarajan wrote recently in the Hindu in " Politics After President Pranab ," the next general election in 2014 might result in a hung Parliament in which any one of four possible coalitions stake a claim to form the government. In that situation, the president would have to exercise prudence and tact in working out whom to invite first to try their luck. But it may also mean that the Congress could compliment itself on installing a former party-man in Rashtrapati Bhavan. And Mukherjee's resume tells us that he has written five books (one of them has the alarming subtitle " Saga of Struggle and Sacrifice "). Perhaps, once he is installed as president and free from the clutches of the party that both raised him and reined him in, Mukherjee could extend his lifelong loyalty to the Congress to the citizenry at large, and write, for their enjoyment and instruction and for the sake of democratic transparency, a memoir of his years negotiating the methods and natures of the often inscrutable dynasty that runs the world's largest democracy.
