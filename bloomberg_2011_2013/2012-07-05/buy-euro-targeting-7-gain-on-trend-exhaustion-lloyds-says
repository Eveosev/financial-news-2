Investors should buy the euro at
current levels and bet for it to strengthen versus the dollar,
according to Lloyds Banking Group Plc.  Traders should target an appreciation to $1.3241 and end
the trade if the shared currency falls to $1.2192, Tim McCullough, a technical strategist at Lloyds, wrote in a note to
clients today. The euro declined 1.1 percent to $1.2388 at 12:01
p.m. in  New York .  The euro’s decline from $1.3487 is at an end amid signals
of trend exhaustion, wrote McCullough.  To contact the reporter on this story:
