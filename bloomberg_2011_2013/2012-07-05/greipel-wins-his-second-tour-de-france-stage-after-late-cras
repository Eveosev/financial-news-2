Andre Greipel sprinted to his second
straight Tour de France stage victory as green-jersey leader
Peter Sagan got caught up in a crash near the end.  Greipel beat out Australian Matt Goss of Orica-GreenEdge
and Juan Jose Haedo, an Argentine with Team Saxo Bank, in a
sprint finish yesterday at the end of stage five: a 122-mile
(196-kilometer) flat ride between Rouen and Saint-Quentin.  “It was one of the hardest sprints I’ve ever done,”
Greipel, a German with the Lotto-Belisol team, told Eurosport.  Switzerland ’s  Fabian Cancellara  kept the race-leading
yellow jersey. He has a  seven-second  advantage over Bradley Wiggins and Sylvain Chavanel. Defending champion  Cadel Evans  is
10 seconds further back.  The  20-stage race  continues today with a 129-mile ride on
mainly flat terrain between Epernay and Metz.  With less than two miles of yesterday’s stage left, a rider
went down and as others swerved to get out of the way, Sagan
went over his handlebars onto the pavement.  The 22-year-old Sagan, who won two of the first three
stages, got back on his bike and kept the green jersey as leader
of the points classification.  The crash slowed Greipel and other riders in the peloton,
improving the chances of one of the members of the four-man
breakaway of winning the stage.  Jan Ghyselinck of the Cofidis team and Pablo Urtasun of
Euskaltel tried to dash for the line. They were caught by the
sprinters a few hundred meters out.  To contact the reporter on this story:
