Banco Santander SA  Chief Executive (SAN) 
Officer Alfredo Saenz will testify in an investigation into
alleged insider trading and money laundering against a former
personal aide.  Saenz will appear at the national court in Madrid on July
13 to give evidence in a probe by judge Eloy Velasco into
allegations against Cedric Canas, said an official for the court
in a phone interview. Canas is accused of buying shares in
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. before a takeover bid by  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the official said.  A Santander official declined to comment in a phone
interview. Santander was one of five banks advising BHP on its
failed Potash Corp. bid in 2010.  Efforts to contact Canas through the bank to seek a comment
weren’t successful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
