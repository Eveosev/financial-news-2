Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan 
nominated Aloma Mariam Mukhtar as Chief Justice, which will make
her the first woman to occupy the position if approved by
lawmakers in Africa’s biggest oil producer.  Jonathan sought lawmakers’ approval for Mukhtar, a justice
of the Supreme Court, as Chief Justice Dahiru Musdapher is due
to retire, according to a letter sent by the president to the
Senate yesterday and handed to Bloomberg News today in Abuja,
the capital.  Mukhtar is the third woman to be appointed by Jonathan to a
high-ranking position in Africa’s most populous country. Diezani Alison-Madueke is petroleum minister and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a
former managing director of the  World Bank , is the minister of
finance.  Jonathan also nominated judges Kumai Bayang Akaahs and
Stanley Shenko Alagoa to the  Supreme Court , according to the
letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
