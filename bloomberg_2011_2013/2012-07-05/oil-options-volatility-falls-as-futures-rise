Crude-oil options volatility slipped
as underlying futures dropped 44 cents, the smallest decline
since June 7.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 34.6 percent at 3:12 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 34.8 percent on July 3.  “There wasn’t much movement today,” said Fred Rigolini,
vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York . “It was
mostly a squaring-off in August.”  Crude oil for August delivery settled at $87.22 a barrel on
the Nymex.  Futures fell as the dollar rose versus the euro when
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the 17-country
currency bloc continues to face economic risk after policy
makers cut  interest rates  to a record low. A stronger dollar
reduces the investment appeal of commodities.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
August $80 puts, which were unchanged at 31 cents a barrel at
4:19 p.m. with 3,976 lots trading. September $80 puts were the
second-most active options, with 2,658 lots changing hands as
they gained 21 cents to $1.64.  “August $80 and $85 puts traded toward the close and
August $90 and $98 calls,” Rigolini said. “August $68 and $77
puts traded as a put spread and August $95 and $98 as a call
spread.”  Puts More-Active  Puts accounted for four of the five most heavily traded
options and 52 percent of total electronic trading volume. One
contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 69 percent of the 248,910
contracts traded in the previous session when futures surged on
speculation central banks would ease monetary policy and Iran
oil sanctions would reduce stockpiles.  August $95 calls were the most actively traded, with 25,623
lots changing hands. They rose 30 cents to 42 cents. The next-
most active options, August $98 calls, advanced 15 cents to 23
cents on volume of 22,030.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 44,372
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 39,857 lots and
December $70 puts with 35,715.  To contact the reporter on this story:
