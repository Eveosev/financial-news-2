Guard  Jason Kidd  agreed to join the
New York Knicks, where the 39-year-old may become Jeremy Lin’s
backup, ESPN reported citing people familiar with the decision.  Kidd, who has been with the Dallas Mavericks since the
2007-08 season, was Dallas’s point guard when they won the
National Basketball Association championship in 2011 and started
for New Jersey Nets when they lost in the NBA Finals in 2002 and
2003.  Lin is a restricted free agent. The Houston Chronicle
reported that he agreed to an offer sheet with the  Houston
Rockets . The Knicks have the right to match that offer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
