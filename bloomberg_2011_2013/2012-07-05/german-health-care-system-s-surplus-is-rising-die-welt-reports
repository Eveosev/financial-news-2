Germany’s public health-care system
will increase its surplus this year, spurred by the country’s
economic growth, Die Welt said, citing the agency that
supervises the nation’s social-security systems.  The fund will have an estimated surplus of 23 billion euros
($28.8 billion) at the end of 2012, the newspaper quoted Federal
Insurance Agency head Maximilian Gassner as saying. Saarland
state, which is governed by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s  Christian
Democratic Union , plans to propose legislation to maintain the
surplus and prevent lawmakers from lowering payroll deductions
for health care, Die Welt says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
