Australia’s construction  industry
held near an eight-month low in June as interest-rate reductions
failed to stem a slide in apartment building, a private gauge
showed.  The construction performance index was 34.8 last month
compared with 34.7 in May and has contracted for 25 consecutive
months, a survey by the Australian Industry Group and the
Housing Industry Association released in Sydney today showed. A
reading below 50 represents a contraction.  The  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  lowered the nation’s
benchmark borrowing cost by a total of 75 basis points in May
and June to 3.5 percent, before keeping rates unchanged this
week saying recent reductions will help the economy weather a
more subdued global outlook. Today’s report showed residential
and commercial construction remained weak and apartment building
recorded its steepest fall in 10 months.  The data “confirm that new home building conditions will
deteriorate further in the second half of 2012,”  Harley Dale ,
HIA’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Residential
construction activity looks set to trough at GFC-equivalent
levels and yet we’re not in the midst of the GFC. That is a
concerning update on Australia’s economic prospects and policy
makers should heed this clear signal for policy action.”  Construction of apartments fell 4.9 points to 21.8, while
house building rose 2.5 points to 30.7, today’s report showed.
New orders fell 0.3 point to 33.4, while a gauge of employment
rose 0.3 point to 38.7 last month, it showed. Engineering
construction fell 1.4 points to 39.9, according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
