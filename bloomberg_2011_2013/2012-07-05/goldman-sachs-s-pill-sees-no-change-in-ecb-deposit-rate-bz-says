Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s European
Chief Economist Huw Pill predicts the  European Central Bank  will
leave its deposit rate unchanged at 0.25 percent, while cutting
its benchmark rate to 0.75 percent, Boersenzeitung reported.  The ECB shouldn’t increase purchases of euro-area
peripheral sovereign debt as the central bank can’t keep yields
low forever, Pill told the German newspaper in an interview.
Countries like Italy need to implement reforms to regain trust,
Pill was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
