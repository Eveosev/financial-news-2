European Central Bank Vice President
Vitor Constancio comments on monetary policy and the euro-area’s
sovereign-debt crisis. He spoke at a press conference in
 Frankfurt  today after the ECB cut interest rates to a record-low
0.75 percent from 1 percent.  “The conclusions of the review was that the program was still
on track. The conclusion was positive. We have to wait and see
how the economy will perform in the near future. Certainly all
conditions are there for the compliance with the program.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
