Verbund AG (VER) ,  Austria ’s largest
utility, fell the most in a week after Morgan Stanley cut its
rating on the stock, citing lower power prices.  Verbund dropped as much as 1.8 percent in Vienna trading,
the biggest intraday decline since June 28. It was down 1.2
percent at 18.35 euros as of 10:44 a.m. local time, extending
this year’s slump to 11 percent.  Morgan Stanley cut the stock to  equalweight  from overweight
and reduced its share-price estimate to 23 euros from 24 euros,
saying Verbund’s A-/A2  credit rating  is at risk in the “current
commodity-price environment,” according to a note to clients.  European power utilities have seen profit margins tighten
as the region’s economic stagnation damps demand. German power
for next-year delivery has fallen 10 percent from its 2012 high
on Feb. 27, and sank to a record-low on June 18. Prices may
recover as aging power stations are closed, Morgan Stanley said.  “We see upside risk to power prices over the next 12 to 18
months as older, uneconomical thermal plant comes off the system
in  Germany , and we feel this will support the shares in the
medium term,” Arsalan Obaidullah, an analyst at the brokerage
in  London , said in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
