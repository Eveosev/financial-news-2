Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed to the highest level in more than two years, according
to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen increased 3.09 million barrels, or
15 percent, to 23.7 million in the seven days to yesterday,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. That’s the highest since the week ended May 19, 2010.  Middle-distillate supplies including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene dropped 470,000 barrels, or 5.7 percent, to 7.79
million, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the lowest since the
week ended Dec. 14.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate rose 401,000 barrels, or 3.7 percent, to 11.4
million, the highest in three weeks, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
