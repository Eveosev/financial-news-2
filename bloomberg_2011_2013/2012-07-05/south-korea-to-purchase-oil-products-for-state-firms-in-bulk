South Korea ’s government plans to buy
oil products for 44,000 state organizations in bulk, seeking to
boost competition among refiners and curb price increases.  The Public Procurement Service, which manages commodities
for the government, will hold the first such auction on July 27
for 500 million liters (132 million gallons) or more of vehicle
oil products such as gasoline and diesel, the Daejeon-based
 agency  said in an e-mailed statement today.  The agency will reach an annual contract with the supplier
that offers “the lowest price,” it said. The price will be
applied to all 44,000 in the group.  South Korea’s government, wary that the current
distribution structure may be limiting competition, has
committed to breaking the hold on domestic fuel supplies
controlled by four refiners, including SK Innovation Co. In the
latest move, Samsung Total Petrochemical Co. was approved by the
government to supply oil products to gas stations run by state-
run Korea National Oil Corp. and the National Agricultural
Cooperative Federation.  SK Innovation, GS Caltex and two other refiners controlled
98 percent of the country’s oil product sales last year,
according to the statement.  The Public Procurement Service estimates it will need to
buy 2.8 billion liters of oil products a year for the group.
Bulk procurement will save 30 billion won ($26 million) a year,
assuming sales total 4.8 trillion won, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
