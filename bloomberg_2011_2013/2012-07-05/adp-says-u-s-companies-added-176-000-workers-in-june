Companies in the U.S. added more
workers than forecast in June, which may ease concern the labor
market is deteriorating, a private payrolls report showed.  The 176,000 increase followed a revised 136,000 gain the
prior month that was higher than initially estimated, according
to figures released today by Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Employer Services. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 100,000 advance.  A pickup in hiring that’s sustained will help generate the
wage growth needed to spur  consumer spending , which accounts for
about 70 percent of the world’s largest economy. A Labor
Department report due tomorrow may show that private payrolls
accelerated in June from a month earlier, while the  unemployment
rate  held at 8.2 percent, economists projected.  “The economy is weakening but we’re not falling off a
cliff,” said Neil Dutta, head U.S. economist at Renaissance
Macro Research LLC in New York. “You should see some employment
growth but it won’t be enough to lower the unemployment rate in
any meaningful way.”  Fewer Americans than forecast filed  first-time claims  for
unemployment insurance payments last week, another report today
showed. Applications for jobless benefits decreased 14,000 in
the week ended June 30 to 374,000, the fewest since the middle
of May, Labor Department figures showed.  Stock Futures  Stock-index futures trimmed losses after the figures, with
the contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September little changed at 1,367.8 at 8:35 a.m. in  New York 
after falling as much as 0.4 percent.  Estimates of the 35 economists surveyed by Bloomberg ranged
from gains of 50,000 to 150,000 in the ADP report. ADP’s initial
figures for May showed a gain of 133,000, while the Labor
Department said companies added 82,000 workers that month.  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figure was
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in April, when it understated the increase in jobs by
11,000. The estimate was least accurate in December, when it
overstated the employment gain by 113,000.  Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and
builders, added 16,000 workers in June, today’s ADP figures
showed. Employment in construction increased by 8,000, while
factories added 4,000 jobs.  Service Industry  Service providers increased employment by 160,000 workers.  Companies employing more than 499 workers took on 11,000
workers. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees,
added 72,000 and small companies increased payrolls by 93,000,
ADP said.  A Labor Department report due tomorrow may show that
private payrolls rose by 100,000 in June and unemployment stayed
at 8.2 percent, economists projected.  The ADP report is based on data from businesses with a
total of more than 21 million workers on payrolls. Macroeconomic
Advisers LLC in  St. Louis  produces the data with ADP.  Used-vehicle seller  Carmax Inc. (KMX)  is among companies feeling
the pinch of limited income growth and a jobless rate that’s
exceeded 8 percent for 40 straight months.  “The weak economy and high unemployment rate continues to
be a drag on the consumer,” Thomas Folliard, chief executive
officer at CarMax, a Richmond, Virginia-based used-vehicle
retailer, said on a conference call with analysts on June 21.  Consumer Spending  Bigger increases in employment that would help drive the
wages gains are needed to power household purchases, which
stalled in May. Spending was little changed in May after a 0.1
percent rise the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed
last week.  “Certainly a stronger jobs market and a lower unemployment
would be a nice shot in the arm for both of retail and
delivery,” said Michael Miles, president and chief operating
officer of  Staples Inc. (SPLS) , an office supply retailer based in
Framingham,  Massachusetts . Unemployment must fall to around 6
percent to trigger strong growth, he said. “I don’t think we’re
waiting around and holding our breath for that in the retail
space.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
