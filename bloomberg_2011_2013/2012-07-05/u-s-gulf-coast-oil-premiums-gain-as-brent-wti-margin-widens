U.S. Gulf Coast crudes strengthened
against West Texas Intermediate as WTI’s discount to  Brent crude 
widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent increased by $1.55 from
yesterday to $13.66 at 2:22 p.m. in  New York . When Brent rises
versus WTI, it typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades
that compete foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast, Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
WTI widened 5 cents to $13 a barrel at 2:16 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s
premium to WTI narrowed 20 cents to $13.40 a barrel.  Poseidon’s premium to WTI increased 15 cents to $8.15 a
barrel. Southern Green Canyon’s premium was steady at $7.50 a
barrel. Mars Blend added 5 cents to $9.15 a barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 75 cents to
$11.40 a barrel over WTI.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed $3.50 to $26.50 a
barrel below WTI.  Syncrude’s discount narrowed $2.50 to $2.75 below WTI.
Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in
 Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $10 below the U.S.
benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
