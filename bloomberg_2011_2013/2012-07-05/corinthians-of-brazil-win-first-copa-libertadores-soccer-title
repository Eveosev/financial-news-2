Corinthians will represent  South
America  at soccer’s Club World Cup in December after winning
their first Copa Libertadores title.  The Brazilian team beat Argentina’s Boca Juniors 2-0 in  Sao
Paulo  last night to complete a 3-1 aggregate victory in the two-
game final following last week’s 1-1 tie in Buenos Aires.  Corinthians join European Cup winner Chelsea, North
and Central American champion Monterrey of Mexico and Oceania
champion Auckland City as qualifiers for the  seven-team event  in
Japan, which will also feature the champions of Asia, Africa and
a club from the host nation.  Striker Emerson got both goals in the second half, opening
the scoring with a close-range shot in the 53rd minute before
finishing off a counterattack 19 minutes later to seal the win.  Corinthians won the inaugural Club  World Cup  in 2000 when
the tournament was held in Brazil.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
