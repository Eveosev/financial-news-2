Ghana  and its partners on the Jubilee
oil field, which include  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and  Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC) , will invest an estimated $20 billion over the next 10
years to develop newly discovered oil fields.  “We will raise the money in collaboration with our
partners,” said Nana Boakye Asafu-Adjaye, chief executive
officer of the Ghana National Petroleum Corp., in a July 3
interview in the capital, Accra. “We have made clusters of
discoveries and these need to be developed.”  Jubilee, which began production in 2010, is operated by
London-based Tullow, which also owns 35.5 percent of the field.
Anadarko and  Kosmos Energy (KOS) , both based in the U.S., each hold
24.1 percent and GNPC 13.6 percent. Sabre Oil & Gas Ltd. holds
2.7 percent.  By May 31 Jubilee had produced 35 million barrels, Asafu-
Adjaye said. Output from the Jubilee oil field is now at 63,000
barrels per day, with production expected to reach an average of
90,000 barrels this year, according to Tullow.  New discoveries in the Deep Water Tano Block include
Tweneboa and Enyenra as well as other clusters of discoveries
such as Mahogany, Teak, Akasa and Banda, Asafu-Adjaye said.  Following Jubilee’s start up oil became Ghana’s third-
biggest export after gold and cocoa last year.  Shares of Tullow, which has the most exploration licenses
of any  oil company  operating in Africa, fell 1.7 percent, to
1,476 pence at the close in London, giving the company a market
value of 13.4 billion pounds ($20.8 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
