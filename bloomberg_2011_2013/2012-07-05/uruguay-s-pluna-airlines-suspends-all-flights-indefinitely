Uruguayan Pluna Airlines Inc. decided
to “suspend all flights indefinitely,” as “the economic and
financial situation of the company makes it impossible to ensure
proper operation,” according to a press statement.  “The company will provide all the resources available to
contact the passengers affected by these circumstances in order
to seek the best possible solution,” the company said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
