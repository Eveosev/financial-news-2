The World Bank Group’s International
Finance Corp. and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  will provide 55 million euros
($68 million) in loans for a wind farm in  Croatia  as the nation
seeks to boost renewable energy use.  The IFC will loan 20 million euros for the Danilo wind farm
developed by the local unit of RP Global Holding, which is based
in Vienna, the IFC said today in a statement from its
headquarters in  Washington .  The IFC also mobilized 35 million euros from UniCredit
through a syndicated loan for the 43.7-megawatt park, which will
cost a total of 84.3 million euros, according to the statement.  The Danilo park in central Dalmatia will power homes and
factories when it’s operating, which is due at the end of next
year. The project will boost supply of wind power by 34 percent
in the nation bordering the  Adriatic Sea . It’s set to become the
European Union’s 28th member in July 2013.  The 19-turbine project will be located across sites at
Velika Glava, Bubrig and Crni Vrh, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
