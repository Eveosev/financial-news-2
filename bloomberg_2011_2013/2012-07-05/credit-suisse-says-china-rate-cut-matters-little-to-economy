Tao Dong, Credit Suisse Group AG’s
Hong Kong-based chief  China  economist, comments on China’s
second interest-rate cut in a month.  The People’s Bank of China said today the one-year lending
rate will fall by 31 basis points and the one-year deposit rate
will drop by 25 basis points effective tomorrow. Banks can offer
loans of as much as 30 percent less than benchmark rates, the
central bank said on its website.  “This is a reaction to the slow loan growth and weak
investment activities.”  The “asymmetric cut matters to the banks, but the rate cut
matters little to the economy.”  “China’s in a liquidity trap, so further easing may not be
that effective. The problem today is not that rates are too
high, but that the private sector has lost investment interest,
due to overcapacity and surging costs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
