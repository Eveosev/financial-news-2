Boeing Co. (BA)  will add a third
production line to its single-aisle aircraft factory to make the
new 737 MAX without risking output for the current version of
its best-selling jet.  Squeezing the line into the plant in Renton,  Washington ,
will “isolate” MAX assembly ahead of its 2017 debut while
meeting Boeing’s goal of building 42 of its single-aisle 737s a
month by 2014, said Beverly Wyse, the 737 program chief.  The 737 is the world’s most widely flown jetliner, raising
the stakes for a smooth start to the MAX variant with upgraded
engines. With the 737 family comprising almost two-thirds of all
unfilled orders, Boeing’s challenge is to keep making the
existing model and avoid delays on the new plane like those that
snagged the 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 jumbo jet, Wyse said.  “The production system is at least as important in this
equation as the design of the product to ensure that we can
deliver on time and as efficiently as we do today,” Wyse said
last month in a presentation to reporters in Renton.  Boeing committed to the MAX last year to counter Airbus
SAS’s A320neo, which also features upgraded engines. After
considering whether to go with composite construction like the
787, Chicago-based Boeing opted for traditional aluminum, citing
lower costs and less development time.  The MAX will have an 8 percent fuel-burn advantage over the
A320neo because of a lighter design, new engines, winglets and
tail improvements, according to Boeing. The company is on
schedule to complete detailed configuration of the plane by
mid-2013 and design in 2014, Wyse said.  List Prices  Boeing  lists  the MAX at an average price of $91.5 million,
compared with $84.4 million for the 737-800, the most-ordered
variant of the current 737 lineup. Airlines typically buy at a
discount. MAX orders have reached 451, a tally Boeing expects to
climb to 1,000 by year’s end as it confirms commitments.  The MAX will be the latest version of a  737 family  whose
first version entered service in 1968 and which was dubbed
Boeing’s “bread and butter” by  Nicole Piasecki , the company’s
business-development chief. The 2,605  unfilled orders  for 737s
through May accounted for 66 percent of Boeing’s backlog.  The current 737 will stay in production with the MAX for a
transition period of about two years, Wyse said. Beyond that,
Boeing may make only a couple of the older models a month for
conversions into P-8 military surveillance jets, she said.  Once MAX production is running smoothly, Boeing will
integrate the building of that plane into the main two assembly
lines, Wyse said.  Third Line  The third line then will be kept for future expansion to
meet demand in a market for single-aisle planes that Boeing
predicts will grow to 23,240 deliveries in the next 20 years.  “As we continue to go up in rate, which we would expect
to, we would have the capacity at the site to do that,” Wyse
said. Boeing would need additional investment to raise the third
line’s capacity to the rate of its existing two lines, which
will each pump out 21 planes a month by 2014, Wyse said.  Putting in a third  production line  in a space now occupied
by two will require moving assembly work and tools to different
parts of the Renton factory, said Eric Lindblad, vice president
of 737 manufacturing operations.  “It’s like your house, you accumulate stuff,” Lindblad
said. “We can use this space more efficiently than we are right
now.”  Boeing’s two newest wide-body planes, the 787 and 747-8,
both missed original delivery targets by more than two years.
Those planes are assembled north of  Seattle  in suburban Everett.  Wyse said she is “passionately engaged” to make the
introduction of the MAX as smooth as the latest 737 production
increase to 35 planes per month at the beginning of this year
from 31.5, which went “almost flawlessly,” she said.  “The company is taking incredibly seriously the issues
that we’ve had on some of our recent development programs,”
Wyse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
