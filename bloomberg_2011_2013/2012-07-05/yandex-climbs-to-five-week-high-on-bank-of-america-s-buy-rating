Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russia’s most-used
Internet search engine, jumped to the highest level in five
weeks in New York after Bank of America Corp. recommended
investors buy the stock.  The Hague, Netherlands-based company that is listed on the
Nasdaq Stock Exchange, climbed 3.4 percent to $19.91 by 12:07
p.m. in New York, heading to the highest level since May 31.  Bank of America revised its earlier neutral recommendation
on Yandex stock, according to an e-mailed report today.  “We expect strong second-quarter 2012 numbers from Yandex
at the end of July -- giving investors some comfort on margins
and top-line growth,” Mariya Kahn, an analyst at Bank of
America in Singapore, wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
