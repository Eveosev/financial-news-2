Spain  sold 3 billion euros ($3.8
billion) of bonds, meeting its maximum target, even as borrowing
costs rose on two of the three securities sold.  Spain priced its 10-year benchmark bond at an average yield
of 6.43 percent, compared with 6.044 percent when the securities
were last sold on June 7, and bonds maturing in 2016 yielded an
average 5.536 percent, compared with 5.353 percent. It also sold
its benchmark July 2015 bond to yield 5.086 percent, down from
5.457 percent on June 21.  Demand for the three-year benchmark was 2.28 times the
amount sold, compared with 3.18 in June, and the ratio for the
2016 bonds was unchanged at 2.56. The bid-to-cover for the 10-
year security was 3.18 times, compared with 3.29 in June.  The Spanish auction signaled easing concern about the
government’s ability to finance the euro region’s third-biggest
 budget deficit , even as it paid the most to borrow for a decade
since November. The government is negotiating the terms of its
European bank bailout, while considering additional budget cuts
to offset the impact of the recession on  tax revenue .  “While the Treasury managed to get all its debt out the
door, yield levels were a mixed bag,” Nicholas Spiro, managing
director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy said in an e-mailed note.
“The weakness of public finances, the depth of the downturn and
the vulnerability of parts of the banking sector are all feeding
on each other.”  French Sale  Spain’s 10-year bond yield initially fell after the auction
before returning to the levels it had been trading at before the
sale. The yield was 6.63 percent at 12:45 p.m. in  Madrid ,
widening the difference with similar maturity German debt to
5.18 percentage points.  The Treasury has sold 65 percent of the bonds it plans to
sell in 2012, allowing it to maintain a “prudent strategy” at
auctions, the  Economy Ministry  said in a statement today.  France  sold 7.83 billion euros of debt maturing in 2019,
2022 and 2023 and the 10-year securities yielded 2.53 percent
compared with 2.46 percent in June. Ireland returned to markets
today after nearly a two-year absence and sold 500 million euros
of three-month bills at an average yield of 1.8 percent. By
contrast, Spain paid 2.362 percent to borrow for three months on
June 26.  Bank Bailout  Spain is discussing the terms of 100 billion euros of loans
for its banks with the European Commission as well as measures
needed to cut its  budget deficit  by around 40 percent this year.
Spain’s second recession since 2009 is hampering deficit-
reduction efforts and threatening the government’s pledge to
bring the shortfall within the European Union limit of 3 percent
of gross domestic product next year.  EU leaders agreed on June 29 to let the euro-region bailout
funds lend directly to banks and also decided that the financial
assistance Spain gets for its lenders won’t have seniority over
other creditors.  “The deal has merely shifted the balance of probabilities
surrounding an illiquidity event,”  Luca Jellinek , head of
European interest-rate strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in  London , said before the sale. “No investor
will quickly forget how constrained market conditions became for
periphery issuers during the summer holiday period of 2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
