Chancellor Angela Merkel  maintained
her opposition to shared debt in the euro area, saying  Germany 
didn’t expand its rescue commitments at last week’s European
Union summit.  “This isn’t about taking on any additional liabilities,”
Merkel told reporters in Berlin today. “Liability for banks is
banned under the current rules, just like liability for states.
The decisions in Brussels haven’t changed anything in that
respect.”  Faced with pressure from  Italy  and Spain to help reduce
those countries’ borrowing costs, Merkel said Germany “made
absolutely no commitment beyond what is agreed so far” under
European treaties.  “First and foremost, the issue is banking oversight”
because past stress tests for European banks “didn’t really
detect the problems,” she said. “This is urgently needed. We
need independent supervision.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
