Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
Japanâ€™s biggest publicly traded bank, reduced the number of
Asian equity research analysts at its brokerage unit in Hong
Kong to cut costs.  Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Holdings Co. fired an undisclosed
number of analysts in the city from a previous headcount of
about 10, said Hiroaki Konishi, a Tokyo-based spokesman. It will
keep a few analysts in Hong Kong, he said.  Mitsubishi UFJ is seeking to trim expenses by downsizing
its Asian research operations outside of Japan, Konishi said.
 Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. , a venture formed
with  Morgan Stanley (MS)  in May 2010, will maintain its Tokyo-based
analysts totaling about 10, he said.  The brokerage will suspend its Asian equity sector report
to clients after reducing the personnel, he said. The Wall
Street Journal reported the job cuts earlier today.  Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ rose 1.3 percent to 397 yen today.
The benchmark Topix Index fell 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
