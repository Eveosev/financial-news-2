A broken submarine fiber-optic cable
50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast of the Egyptian city of
Alexandria has caused a nationwide Internet blackout in Lebanon,
the Telecommunications Ministry said today.  Eight countries have been affected by the outage, which
started yesterday evening, the ministry said in a text message.
Lebanon is working with Cyprus and  Egypt  to resolve the problem,
it said.  Lebanon is among few nations that rely entirely on a single
submarine cable for Internet connectivity, making it vulnerable
to such blackouts, Telecommunications Minister Nicolas Sehnaoui
said, according to the Daily Star newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
