The U.K. government indicated it’s
looking for ways to knock down hurdles blocking renewable energy
developments, part of an effort to attract 110 billion pounds
($171 billion) in low-carbon investment.  The Department of Energy and  Climate Change  asked the
industry to provide evidence about what barriers it faces in
reaching power-sales agreements with utilities, noting that some
generators were reporting more unfavorable terms.  “The government would also like to see a diverse
 electricity market  with reduced barriers for new entrants, and
renewable developers are an important part of this,” the
department said in a statement released on its website in  London 
today.  Companies have until Aug. 16 to provide evidence, which
will help shape energy legislation published in a draft form on
May 22. Parliament will consider proposed rules later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
