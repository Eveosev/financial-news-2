Nicholas Lardy , a senior fellow at
the Peterson Institute for International Economics, comments on
China’s decision to cut benchmark  interest rates  for the second
time in a month.  “I have not seen the precise details of the cuts but would
argue that they are cutting again because the economy is weaker
than expected.”  “The authorities certainly have up to the minute data on
loan growth, presumably showing weak credit growth, and they
probably have a preliminary  second-quarter GDP  number that shows
the economy is much weaker than in the first quarter, something
I have been anticipating for quite some time. With very weak
export growth and a moderating pace of investment in housing,
the economy inevitably weakens.”  “Why so soon is probably because when the demand for loans
is weak, as now, it takes larger cuts in lending rates to
generate any response.”  “I have been skeptical for months that the economy was
going to pick up. First, after the first-quarter numbers came
out, lots of investment bank analysts forecast that the second
quarter would show an upturn. Now they are saying the second
half. I doubt that this can happen since I believe  Europe  is
weakening and not likely to show any recovery for quite some
time. And housing looks weak.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
