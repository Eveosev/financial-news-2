Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) , Australia’s
largest construction company, dismissed a senior manager in its
Leighton Offshore division over “failures to meet governance
standards” in its work on oil export facilities in  Iraq .  The manager, who was not named, had not met standards on
“proper documentation of contractual arrangements,” Leighton
said in a regulatory statement.  Leighton said Feb. 13 that it was examining possible law-
breaking over payments made in connection with work to build
offshore crude oil loading terminals in Iraq, and had reported
the matter to the Australian Federal Police.  “Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken if
necessary,” Chief Executive Office Hamish Tyrwhitt said in the
statement. “Leighton is continuing to cooperate with the
ongoing AFP investigation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
