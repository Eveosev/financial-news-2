Wee-Khoon Chong, a Hong Kong-based
fixed-income strategist at  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , comments on
China’s second interest-rate cut in a month.  “Is this the last one? Possibly, but the market would
definitely be looking for more. The magnitude of easing this
time is more of less similar to the one delivered in early June.  ‘‘The rate cut today is likely to re-widen the spread
between two-year non-deliverable  interest-rate swaps  and one-
year benchmark deposit back to the low and therefore leading to
steepening of the two- to five-year swap curve. We would like to
reiterate our call for a two- to five-year swap steepener, with
a first target of 60 basis points, to hit its 2009 high of 100
basis points in the coming months.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
