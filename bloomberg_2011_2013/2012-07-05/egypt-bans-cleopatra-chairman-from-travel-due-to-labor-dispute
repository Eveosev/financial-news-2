Egypt  has banned businessman Mohamed
Abou El Enein, chairman of  Ceramica Cleopatra Group  and a
prominent former member of ousted president Hosni Mubark’s
ruling party, from travelling because of a labor dispute.  Prosecutors are investigating claims the company has
violated a collective labor agreement, withheld pay and taken
measures to prevent workers from doing their jobs, the public
prosecutor’s office said in a faxed statement today.  Ceramica Cleopatra factory workers have taken their
protests from Cairo’s  Tahrir Square  to the gates of a
presidential palace in the capital believed to be where the
newly-elected Mohamed Mursi is staying. The producer of tiles
and sanitary ware employed 12,000 workers and exported its
products to more than 100 countries as of 2008, according to its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
