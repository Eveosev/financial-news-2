Ramin Toloui, Pacific Investment
Management Co.’s global co-head of  emerging markets  portfolio
management in  Singapore , comments on China’s second interest-
rate cut in a month.  The People’s Bank of China said today the one-year lending
rate will fall by 31 basis points and the one-year deposit rate
will drop by 25 basis points effective tomorrow. Banks can offer
loans of as much as 30 percent less than benchmark rates, the
central bank said on its website.  “Chinese authorities are adopting a series of policy
actions designed to insure against the ‘left tail’ scenario of a
major downturn, rather than an aggressive investment stimulus to
supercharge growth.”  “The quick succession of rate cuts points to rising
concerns that the government’s growth target of 7.5 percent for
the year may be at risk. And with inflation on a declining path,
the central bank has more degrees of freedom to act.”  “While these actions provide a cushion, do not count on a
robust bounce,” as the economy and financial sector are “still
digesting the large investments made in recent years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
