Qatar will sign a final agreement on
July 7 to build a steel plant in the Algerian city of Jijel, the
state-run  Qatar News Agency reported .  The agreement to build the plant will be signed by Yousef
Hussain Kamal, Qatarâ€™s finance minister, in Algiers, QNA said.
The plant will be 51 percent owned by Algeria and 49 percent
owned by Qatar, the  news agency  said.  Qatar, through its sovereign wealth fund and companies, has
invested in real estate and industrial projects outside the
emirate, as the country seeks to spend proceeds from the export
of liquefied natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
