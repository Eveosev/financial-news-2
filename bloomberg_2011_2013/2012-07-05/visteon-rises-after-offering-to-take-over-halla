Visteon Corp. (VC) , the auto-parts maker
focusing on growing Asian operations, rose the most in more than
eight months after making an $805 million tender offer yesterday
for South  Korea ’s  Halla Climate Control Corp. (018880) , a maker of air
conditioning and heater systems for cars.  Visteon gained 3.8 percent to $38.59 at 10:45 a.m. in  New
York . The shares earlier rose as much as 8.9 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since Oct. 28.  The company’s offer to buy the remaining 30 percent of
Halla it doesn’t already own, sent shares of the South Korean
company up 12 percent to close at 27,850 won ($24.53) on the
Korea Exchange, the biggest gain since May 2009. Visteon, based
in  Van Buren Township , Michigan, said in a statement it’s
offering 28,500 won a share, a premium of about 14 percent to
Halla’s closing price on July 4.  Visteon, which left bankruptcy in 2010, has been shedding
lower-margin revenue in interiors and lighting to focus on
faster-growing operations in Asia. Visteon is shopping two of
its four units. In combination with Halla, Visteon said it’s the
world’s second-largest supplier of climate-control systems.  “This transaction will pave the way for HCC to play an
even greater role in the global climate market, while
reinforcing its leadership position in Korea,” Visteon Chief
Executive Officer Don Stebbins said in the statement. “It also
will facilitate future investment in climate technology.”  Visteon in May reported a first-quarter net loss of $29
million, its second consecutive quarterly deficit after four
straight profitable quarters. The parts maker has been plagued
by losses since it was spun off in 2000 by  Ford Motor Co. (F)  The
supplier has expanded business with automakers other than Ford
and narrowed its product offerings.  Visteon also said yesterday it ended an agreement the sell
the majority of its interior business to Yanfeng Visteon
Automotive Trim Systems Co., its joint venture with Shanghai-
based  Huayu Automotive Systems Co. (600741)   To contact the reporter on this story:
