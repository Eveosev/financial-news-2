Trayal Korporacija AD (TRAY) , a Serbian tire
maker owned by  Brikel EAD  of  Bulgaria , will begin production of
car tires together with  Belshina JSC  in Belarus.  The cooperation agreement with Belshina for making tires
under the Trayal brand and technology at Belshina’s plant in
Bobruisk, Belarus will be signed later this month, said Hristo
Krusarski, Trayal’s chief executive officer. Belshina tires for
industrial vehicles will be made at Trayal’s plant in Krusevac,
in south-central  Serbia , he said. The tires will be sold mainly
on the Russian, Ukrainian and Belarus markets.  Trayal sold its car-tire unit to  Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., (CTB) 
a U.S. tire maker, for $13 million in December. Cooper Tire
planned to invest $50 million and increase production sixfold to
3 million units, mainly for the European Union market. Trayal
kept the facilities for making truck and motorcycle tires,
protective equipment and explosives.  “We stopped making car tires after we sold one of our
plants to Cooper, but we realized there is still demand for the
products,” Krusarski said in a phone interview. The annual
production in Belarus will be 500,000 units, he said.  Some 1,200 tons of heavy-duty Belshina tires will be made
every month in Krusevac where the Trayal facility currently
operates at just a quarter of its capacity, Krusarski said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
