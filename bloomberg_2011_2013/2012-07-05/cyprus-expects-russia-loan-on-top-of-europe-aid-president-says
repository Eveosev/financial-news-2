Cypriot President Demetris Christofias expressed confidence that his government will win a
loan from  Russia  on top of the European bailout requested last
week.  “We do expect a positive reply,” Christofias told
reporters today in Nicosia, Cyprus. “We are still waiting for
the reply.”  Christofias said the terms for a new Russian loan may be
less onerous than for euro-area rescue funds, which are provided
in exchange for requirements to narrow budget deficits. Russia
lent Cyprus 2.5 billion euros ($3.1 billion) last December.  Cyprus on June 25 became the fifth euro-area nation to
request a financial rescue since Greece triggered the  European
debt crisis  more than two years ago. The other four countries
are Greece, Ireland, Portugal and  Spain .  On June 28, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Shuvalov  said Russia had received requests for financial aid
from other countries, without specifying which ones. A day
earlier, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said no request
from Cyprus had been received.  Christofias said on June 29 the Cypriot request for euro
aid will be mainly for banks. No amount has been specified for
the bailout, which will encompass the public sector as well as
lenders weakened by their exposure to the  Greek economy .  In his remarks today, Christofias described the Russians as
“good friends” and said any Russian aid wouldn’t cancel the
need for euro-area funds.  “We could combine both,” he said. “Let’s just hope we
manage both.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
