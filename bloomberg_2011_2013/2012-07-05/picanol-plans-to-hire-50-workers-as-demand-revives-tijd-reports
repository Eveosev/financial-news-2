Picanol NV (PIC)  plans to hire 50 workers
amid a resurgence in demand and said it is confident about its
outlook in the second half,  De Tijd  reported, citing an
“update” by the maker of weaving machines.  The global market for looms remains volatile, the company
said, according to the Belgian newspaper. Following a
“difficult” first half, Picanol is seeing demand for new
models increase and as it benefits from the weaker euro,  De Tijd 
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
