In most of the world,  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  are in an escalating battle to rule smartphone maps.
In  China , they’ve found a common friend they can’t live without.  Apple has selected  AutoNavi Holdings Ltd. (AMAP)  as a partner for
maps on future iPhones and iPads in China, said two people with
knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified before
an announcement. The Beijing-based maps company has worked with
Google since 2006.  Apple’s decision gives AutoNavi a leg up against its chief
rival,  NavInfo Co. (002405) , which works with  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , Nokia Oyj, and
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  The two Chinese companies are locked in a
tight competition: AutoNavi, which also works with  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)  and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , had 45 percent of China’s
mobile map data market in the first-quarter, versus 43 percent
for NavInfo, according to researcher Analysys International.  “When Apple comes into China, they want to choose the best
map they can, and lo and behold, they choose AutoNavi,” said
Jake Lynch, who rates AutoNavi a buy at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
 Shanghai . “By getting onto all the new iPhones and iPads,
AutoNavi will be increasing their users pretty dramatically.”  Mobile e-commerce in China will generate 305 billion yuan
($48 billion) of transactions annually by 2015, 26 times the
value last year, and about 20 percent of the market will rely on
location-based technology, industry analyst iResearch estimates.
Mobile marketing may jump 10-fold to 24.5 billion  yuan  a year,
more than one-fifth of which will use technology that matches
merchants with consumers based on their whereabouts, according
to iResearch.  Google Bumped  After using  Google Maps  on the iPhone and iPad for years,
Apple in June introduced its own mapping service for the next
version of its mobile-device software. In China, owners of those
devices will use AutoNavi’s map service and data instead of
Apple’s. Beta, or test, versions of the software show AutoNavi’s
logo on maps.  Just a dozen companies -- all of them Chinese -- have
licenses for collecting map survey data. That means Apple,
Google, and other foreigners need local partners such as
AutoNavi or NavInfo to make their maps, according to Yan
Xiaojia, an analyst at Analysys.  AutoNavi fell 1 percent to close at $12.82 in  New York 
trading today. The stock has gained 28 percent this year,
outperforming the Shenzhen-traded shares of NavInfo, which have
declined 27 percent.  Mobile Ad Sales  Apple’s change from  Google Maps  will hurt mobile
advertising sales at the search-engine company, said Nancy Shen,
an analyst at iResearch. About a third of Google Map users in
China currently access the service via Apple devices, Analysys
estimates.  Helen Zhu, an investor relations manager at AutoNavi in
Beijing, declined to comment on the company’s business with
Apple. Carolyn Wu, a spokeswoman at Apple in Beijing, declined
to comment on the company’s mobile map service in China.  Google seeks to “build the perfect map for our users in
the months and years ahead,” the company said in an e-mailed
statement, declining to comment on its maps service in China.  AutoNavi’s digital mapmaking business started with its car
navigation products. The company, like Google, has a fleet of
specially outfitted vehicles to take photos and uses satellite
and infrared imaging to capture data for its maps.  Chairman Jun Hon, a former official at the Beijing
Municipal Public Security Bureau, co-founded AutoNavi in 2002
with Chief Executive Officer Congwu Cheng to make car navigation
systems. The company obtained a surveying and mapping license in
2004 to provide digital maps data.  Market Share  In 2010, AutoNavi set up a map venture in China with  TomTom
NV. (TOM2)  Last month, the Amsterdam company said it signed an
agreement to supply map content to Apple.  NavInfo maps data were installed on more than 37 million
handsets at the end of last year, the company said in an e-mail.
NavInfo said it also supplies data for devices made by Samsung,
Motorola Mobility, and Sony Corp.  By comparison, AutoNavi had 52 million users for its mobile
maps app at the end of March, according to its first-quarter
report.  Spending to expand mobile mapping has crimped earnings at
AutoNavi. The company’s first-quarter profit fell 16 percent to
$8.9 million as operating expenses and research-and-development
costs increased.  The company is working with Internet operators including
Ctrip.com International Ltd., China’s biggest online travel
site, and e-commerce provider Lashou.com to integrate
information including hotel and restaurant locations into its
maps.  AutoNavi is diversifying into technology for consumer
devices more quickly than NavInfo, according to Hu Jiaming, an
analyst at Capital Securities Corp. in Shanghai.  “NavInfo is still much more focused on its auto
division,” Hu said. “Some of the company’s partners in mobile
maps, such as Nokia, are not doing too well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
