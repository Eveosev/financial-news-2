Presumptive Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney and allied party committees raised more than
$100 million in June,  Republican National Committee  political
director Rick Wiley said yesterday on Twitter.  Romney, like President  Barack Obama , is raising money
jointly with national and state party committees. This allows
donors to contribute more than the $2,500 each for the primary
and general election campaigns that is the maximum they can give
directly to a candidate’s campaign.  Obama and Romney are shunning federal funds for their
general election campaigns, making 2012 the first entirely
privately funded presidential race since the Watergate scandal
created a public finance system for White House beginning in the
1976 election.  Wiley’s announcement didn’t break down how much money went
directly into Romney’s campaign coffers and how much was
earmarked for the national and state political parties. A Romney
campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, didn’t respond to a request
for comment.  Obama raised more than twice as much as Romney for his
campaign committee, $261.4 million to $123.6 million, through
May 31. In addition, through that date the  Democratic National
Committee  took in $189.2 million to $169.4 million for its
Republican counterpart.  The campaigns and the parties are scheduled to report their
June totals to the  Federal Election Commission  by July 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
