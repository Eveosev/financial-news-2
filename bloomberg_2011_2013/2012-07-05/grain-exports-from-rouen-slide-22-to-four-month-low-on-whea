Grain exports from the French port of
Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 22 percent in
the latest week to a four-month low as the smallest amount of
wheat was shipped since at least August 2010.  Cargoes slid to 31,368 metric tons between June 28 and July
4 from 39,980 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River port  wrote in
an e-mailed report today. That included 11,545 tons of soft
wheat, less than a third of the prior week’s 35,816 tons.  Grain loadings fell to the lowest since the seven days
through Feb. 22.  Ivory Coast  was the main destination with
10,000 tons of soft wheat, followed by the U.K. with 4,400 tons
of barley and 3,150 tons of corn.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the  North Sea , which shipped out 17 percent and 11
percent respectively, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
