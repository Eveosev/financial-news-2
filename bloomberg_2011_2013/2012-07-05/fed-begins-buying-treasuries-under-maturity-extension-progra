The  Federal Reserve  began buying
Treasuries as part of its program to replace $667 billion of
short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in
an effort to reduce borrowing costs further and counter rising
risks of a recession.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York listed the securities
it is considering for purchase during todayâ€™s operation on its
website.
