Russia reopened a five-year-old
investigation of opposition leader Alexey Navalny over losses at
state-owned timber company KirovLes, Interfax reported citing
Russia’s Investigative Committee.  Alexander Bastrykin, who heads the Investigative Committee,
ordered the move, the Moscow-based news service cited committee
spokesman  Vladimir Markin  as saying today.  The probe, which dates back to 2007, when Navalny was an
adviser to the Kirov region’s governor, began in 2011 and was
closed two months ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
