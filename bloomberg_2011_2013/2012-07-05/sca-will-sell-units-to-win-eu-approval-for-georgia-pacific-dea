Svenska Cellulosa AB (SCAA) ,  Europe ’s
biggest tissue maker, will sell assets to win European Union
approval for its 1.32 billion-euro ($1.65 billion) bid for
Georgia-Pacific LLC’s European tissue operations.  The European Commission said the companies would sell a
production facility and brands in the U.K. and Ireland, sell a
factory in Sweden, and offer a license for its Lotus brand for
the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg to eliminate antitrust
concerns that the company would face less competition from
rivals  To contact the reporter on this story:
