Mark Williams , chief Asia economist
at Capital Economics Ltd. in  London , comments on China’s second
interest-rate cut in a month.  The one-year lending rate will fall by 31 basis points and
the one-year deposit rate will drop by 25 basis points effective
tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said on its website today.
Banks can offer loans of as much as 30 percent less than
benchmark rates, the central bank said.  “This is a step beyond what was expected from policy
makers. There was widespread anticipation that the reserve ratio
would be cut again soon, but most were expecting the next
benchmark rate cut to be delayed until the end of July or later.  ‘‘The bigger cut to the lending than the savings rate
probably doesn’t signal too much. It simply tidies up an anomaly
whereby the one-year lending rate was, prior to the move, an
ungainly 6.31 percent. The decision to increase the maximum
discount allowed is significant. This was only increased from 10
percent a month ago. This will further eat into bank profits but
increases the effective amount of policy loosening.  ‘‘Finally, the People’s Bank statement, unusually, stresses
that banks should continue to implement controls on mortgage
lending. Policy makers are trying to tread a thin line of
wanting to expand credit while preventing the re-emergence of
speculative investment in property.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
