BP Plc (BP) , the oil producer that’s
selling assets to help pay for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill,
has been excluded from companies allowed to bid for Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co.’s onshore oil fields, Petroleum Intelligence
Weekly reported, citing unnamed people.  Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, a concession
that’s expiring in 2014 and of which London-based BP is a
partner, is spinning off the onshore fields, the weekly
publication said in its July 9 issue.  Companies including  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  received the three-page invitations to
prequalify to bid on the fields, the publication said.  Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, Total and Partex Oil & Gas have
been shareholders in output from  oil fields  under a concession
agreement that dates back to 1939. The fields began commercial
production in 1960. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. joined as a
partner in the 1970s, forming Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Oil
Operations, which holds the rights for six main deposits until
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
