Turkish bond  yields  declined for an
eighth day to the lowest in nine months after the central bank
extended its cheaper funding policy and the  European Central
Bank  and  China  cut  interest rates , lowering borrowing costs.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt fell 11 basis points, or
0.11 percentage point, to 8.06 percent at the close in Istanbul,
the weakest level since Sept. 20. The lira slid 0.1 percent to
1.8087 per dollar at 6:12 p.m. in Istanbul, depreciating for a
second day and the least since June 28.  The central bank provided liquidity today at the lowest
5.75 percent policy rate for a 23rd consecutive day, cutting the
average  funding cost  to 8.42 percent, the lowest since May 3.
Governor Erdem Basci said on June 28 he may revise the year-end
inflation rate forecast of 6.5 percent toward the official
target of 5 percent.  Turkey ’s economy contracted 0.4 percent in
the first quarter.  “The central bank is lowering the effective cost of
funding since June and the market is pricing that the easing
will continue,” Ugur Kucuk, a fixed-income strategist at
Istanbul-based Is Securities, said in e-mailed comments.  The ECB and the People’s Bank of China today cut their
benchmark borrowing costs to stimulate demand. The  Bank of
England  raised the size of its asset-purchase program, pressing
ahead with monetary easing.  The decline in Turkish economic growth is the first since
gross domestic product shrunk 5.5 percent in the first quarter
of 2009 and compares with a 0.4 percent expansion in the last
three months of 2011.  Turkey’s capacity utilization slid to 74.6 percent in June
from 76.7 percent a year earlier, according to a central bank
report on June 25, pointing to increasing output gap in the
economy. Its inflation rate advanced to 8.9 percent in June from
8.3 percent in May, beating the median estimate of 9.5 percent
from nine economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Basci introduced an interest-rate corridor in October to
execute the bank’s unorthodox monetary policy, switching between
rates of 5.75 percent and 11.5 percent on a daily basis to tame
inflation and rein in the current-account deficit by curbing
credit growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
