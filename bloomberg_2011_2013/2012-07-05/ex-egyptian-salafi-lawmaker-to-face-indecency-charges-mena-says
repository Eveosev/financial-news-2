A former Egyptian lawmaker from the
ultraconservative Salafi group who authorities allege was caught
in a car with a young woman in a compromising position will be
referred to court on indecency charges, the state-run Middle
East  News Agency  reported.  Authorities said Ali Wanis, who represented the Nour Party
in the now-dissolved legislature, was found last month in a
parked car with a university student on a stretch of road near
the Nile Delta city of Tokh.  Prosecutors had sought to have his parliamentary immunity
stripped so he could be questioned about the incident. State
media had reported Wanis said the woman was a relative who
wasn’t feeling well and that they were doing nothing improper.  Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud,  Egypt ’s prosecutor-general, referred
Wanis and the woman to court on charges of “committing an
indecent act on a public thoroughfare,” MENA reported, citing
the prosecutor’s office. The move came after the lawmaker failed
to appear as promised before prosecutors, the Cairo-based news
agency said. Wanis also faces charges of slandering or insulting
a police officer, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
