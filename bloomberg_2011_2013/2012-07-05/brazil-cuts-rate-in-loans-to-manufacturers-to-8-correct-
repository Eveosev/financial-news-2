(Corrects headline and first paragraph to say the country
cut the rate of an existing lending program.)  Brazil ’s national monetary council
lowered interest rates to 8 percent from 9 percent on a credit
line of 6.7 billion reais of the Revitaliza program, which funds
exports and investment in 20 manufacturing industries, according
to a statement from the central bank.  The funds of the program are released by the country’s
national development bank, or BNDES, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
