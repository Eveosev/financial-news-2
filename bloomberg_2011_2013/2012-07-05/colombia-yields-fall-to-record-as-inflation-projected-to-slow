Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
benchmark yields to a record low, as forecasts of slowing
inflation buoyed demand for the fixed-rate securities.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 6.92 percent at 9:48 a.m. in Bogota, according to the central
bank. That is the lowest level on a closing basis since the
securities were first sold in 2009. The price rose 0.249 centavo
to 124.592 centavos per peso.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.32 percent in June from 3.44
percent in prior month, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The national statistics agency
is slated to release figures today at 7 p.m. in Bogota. The
central bank targets inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent.  “People have been cutting their inflation and growth
forecasts” following reports showing the economy decelerated,
William Florez, an analyst at  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) ’s brokerage unit in
Bogota, said in a phone interview.  Colombia’s central bank on June 29 held the overnight
lending rate for a fourth straight month at 5.25 percent as
growth cooled and prices of the country’s commodities exports
dropped. Government reports in June showed industrial output and
retail sales unexpectedly fell in April and the economy expanded
4.7 percent in the first quarter, its slowest pace since 2010.  Florez cut his growth forecast for the Colombian economy
this year to 4.6 percent from 5.1 percent.  The peso declined for the first time in five days,
depreciating 0.4 percent to 1,773.71 per dollar. It has rallied
9.3 percent this year, the best performance among all currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
