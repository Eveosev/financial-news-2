Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said
the U.K. will cut its army to 82,000 personnel by 2020 from
102,000, around half its size at the height of the  Cold War  in
1978, as he announced which units will be merged or scrapped.  The cuts are part of broader government spending
reductions, as well as a response to gaps in the defense-
ministry budget that Hammond’s Conservative Party blames on the
previous Labour administration. Hammond said the number of part-
time reservists will be doubled to 30,000 by 2020 to back up the
regular army in the biggest shakeup in 100 years.  “Our combat role in  Afghanistan  is coming to an end and
with it the predictability of the army’s main effort,” Hammond
told lawmakers in Parliament in London today. “Looking beyond
2014 we need to restructure to face an increasingly uncertain
world.”  There will be 17 fewer major units as a result of the
program, known as “Army 2020.” The reductions will fall across
infantry, cavalry and logistics units and shrink the force to
its lowest level since the Napoleonic wars in the early 19th
century. Under spending plans announced in 2010, the defense
ministry must cut its budget by 8 percent over four years.  The “Army 2020” plan will also split the force in two,
comprising a reaction force to respond to global emergencies and
an adaptable force capable of a wide range of tasks and
deployments.  The scrapping of individual battalions with histories
dating back hundreds of years has provoked an outcry in the
military and their supporters.  Hammond said the restructuring would create a “balanced,
capable and adaptable British army that will remain best in
class.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
