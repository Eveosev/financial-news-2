Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038) ,
a contract maker of phones for  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and  Research in Motion
Ltd ., is set to name company veteran Calvin Chih its new chief
executive officer after Terry Cheng resigned.  Chih, who joined Lang Fang, China-based FIH in 2005 when it
acquired the mobile-phone design company he founded, will be
interim CEO ahead of formal approval by the company’s board, Hon
Hai Precision Industry Co. spokesman Simon Hsing said by phone
today. Hon Hai, based in Taipei, is the parent of FIH with a
stake of about 70 percent.  Chih takes charge of a company struggling with the decline
of three of its largest clients -- Nokia, RIM and Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc., while the rest of the Foxconn Technology
Group benefits from surging demand for Apple Inc. iPhones and
iPads. Chih founded Chi Mei Communication Systems Inc. in 2001
and headed the team that designed FIH’s first handsets for
Motorola.  FIH fell 1.9 percent to HK$2.66 as of 11:01 a.m. in  Hong
Kong  trading, extending its drop this year to 47 percent. The
stock has declined more than 90 percent from its November 2006
high.  Annual revenue  fell for a fourth consecutive year in 2011
to $6.35 billion from a peak of $10.7 billion in 2007, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  FIH’s net income of $90.5 million for the six months to
Dec. 31 ended three consecutive semi-annual losses as customers
boosted outsourcing. On April 27 the company said its first-half
loss would widen from the $17.7 million it posted a year
earlier.  Nokia, Motorola, RIM  Nokia, Motorola and Research in Motion have posted at least
four consecutive quarters of losses or declining profits as they
struggle to increase revenue amid the surging popularity of
smartphones from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and  HTC Corp. (2498)   FIH’s three  largest customers  accounted for 70 percent of
sales last year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
data from its 2011 annual report, which didn’t name the clients.  Chih, listed in FIH’s annual report published in April as
53 years old, has 32 years experience in the communication
industry including positions at GTE Corp. and Rockwell
Semiconductor Systems, according to the annual report.  Cheng, 59, is quitting less than a third of the way into a
three-year term as CEO that began Jan. 1. He has been at the
company since 2007 after 10 years as  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) ’s
president for  Asia .  FIH gave Cheng a three-year contract with an annual salary
of NT$3.5 million ($117,000) plus bonus when he replaced Samuel
Chin, who relinquished the executive role while remaining
chairman, the company said Nov. 30.  Cheng will retire from Foxconn Technology Group on July 31,
Hon Hai, the Taipei-based flagship of the group, said in a
statement late yesterday.  FIH’s annual report lists the company’s head office as
being in Lang Fang, in  China ’s Hebei province, with its
principal place of business in Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
