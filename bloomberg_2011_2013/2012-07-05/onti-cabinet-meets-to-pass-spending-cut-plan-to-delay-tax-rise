Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s cabinet
was meeting in  Rome  to approve more than 4.2 billion euros ($5.2
billion) of spending cuts to stave off a sales-tax increase that
may further sap demand in the recession-hit economy.  The Cabinet meeting to approve the plan began in Rome after
6 p.m. and was still going after midnight.  The plan may cut transfers to regional governments, limit
the scope of the public health-care system, force central and
local administration to scale back spending and reduce the size
of the civil service, the heads of the main Italian regions said
July 3 after talks with Monti on the plan.  The government is planning to use the savings to avoid a
planned increase in the value-added tax of 2 percentage points
slated for October while maintaining its goal of trimming the
deficit to 1.7 percent of gross domestic product this year. The
savings will also help Italy fund relief and reconstruction in
the northern region of Emilia Romagna that was hit by two fatal
earthquakes in May and aid thousands of retirees who were left
without a pension after the  retirement age  was raised in
December.  Italy is mired in its fourth recession since 2001 and the
economy is set to contract 2.4 percent this year, employers’
lobby Confindustria forecast June 28.  The plan may be passed as a decree law, which means that it
will take effect immediately, before formal parliamentary
approval. Italy’s two biggest workers union have already
threatened to strike over the cuts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
