VTB Group,  Russia ’s second-biggest
lender, declined the most in a week after first-quarter profit
dropped 13 percent.  VTB shares retreated as much as 2.3 percent before trading
down 1.9 percent at 5.92 kopeks by 10:43 a.m. in Moscow. The
 Micex Index (VTBMICX)  declined 0.5 percent to 1,437.21.  Net income  attributable to shareholders fell to 22.7
billion rubles ($700 million) from 26 billion rubles a year
earlier, the Moscow-based bank said in a statement today. The
average estimate in a VTB poll of 21 investment banks was for
profit of 22.2 billion rubles.  “We delivered solid results with a strong return on equity
of 15 percent for the first three months of 2012,” Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB, said in the statement. Optimizing VTB’s
asset base, improving operational efficiency and risk management
policies will help VTB “maintain a strong position in an
extremely challenging global market environment.”  Gross loans slid 0.8 percent in the first quarter to 4.55
trillion rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
