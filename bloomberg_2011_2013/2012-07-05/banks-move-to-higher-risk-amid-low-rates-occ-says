The largest national banks have led
their industry toward increased holdings of securities that
expose them to “inappropriate risk” as interest rates linger
at unusually low levels, according to a report from the U.S.
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  Investment portfolios at national banks rose from 13 to 20
percent in the three years since the 2008 financial crisis,
centering on growing investments in mortgage instruments, the
OCC said in a report on banking-industry risks released today.
The regulator of national banks said the chase for profit may
lead to “inappropriate levels of risk.”  “As net interest income has declined, non-interest income
faces ongoing pressures from legislative, regulatory, and market
changes that have depressed fee income, servicing and
securitization income, and may restrain future trading
revenue,” the report said. “These pressures are most intense
at the largest banks, though smaller banks also feel the
effects.”  Pursuing new products in less familiar markets will also
increase risk as banks look for ways to ease revenue declines in
core business lines, the report said.  Small banks have also increased their investments to make
up for “tepid” loan demand and significantly lengthened the
maturities in their portfolio, leaving them vulnerable to future
rate spikes, according to the industry risk analysis, which is
the first in what the OCC said will be twice-yearly reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
