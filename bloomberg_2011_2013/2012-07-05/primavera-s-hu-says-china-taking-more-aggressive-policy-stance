Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera
Capital Group, comments on  China ’s decision to cut benchmark
 interest rates  for the second time in a month.  “The central bank is taking a more aggressive stance
towards easing monetary and credit conditions as the Chinese
economy continues to face significant downside risks.”  “Falling inflation has also increased the PBOC’s policy
flexibility to cut interest rates. Monetary easing should play a
helpful role in stimulating domestic demand and mitigating the
risk of a hard landing in China.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
