Intermoney Valores SV, the brokerage
that bought a net 430 million euros ($538 million) of  Repsol SA (REP) 
for its customers in June as the stock hit a nine-year low, has
sold about 40 percent in July as the  oil company  rallied.  The Madrid-based broker, the biggest acquirer of Repsol
shares last month, has sold a net 188 million euros of the stock
in July, according to securities exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg. That included a single 15 million-share trade on July
2 at 12.70 euros a share worth 190.5 million euros. Intermoney
is the 11th-largest Spanish broker by sales volume in 2012.  Repsol was the worldâ€™s worst-performing oil stock this year
through June as its Argentine unit was nationalized. The Madrid-
based driller attracted buyers going into the second half and
yesterday recorded its biggest six-day rally since 2008. The
shares today dropped 3.1 percent to close at 12.91.  A spokeswoman for Intermoney in Madrid declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
