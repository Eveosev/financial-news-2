Hungary’s currency depreciated a
second day after the central bank warned the government may miss
revenue targets on a proposed financial transaction tax and data
showed the budget gap widened in June.  The forint weakened 0.2 percent to 286.34 per euro by 4:26
p.m. in Budapest. The yield on the government’s benchmark 10-
year bonds fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
7.85 percent.  The transaction tax will probably miss the Cabinet’s
revenue goal for 2013 and may violate European Union rules, the
central bank said today. The tax proposal will feature in aid
talks with the  International Monetary Fund , Antal Rogan, the
head of ruling party lawmakers, said on TV2 on July 3. Hungary’s
budget gap increased to 90 percent of the full-year target by
the end of June, the  Economy Ministry  said today.  “The market is focusing on the central bank’s opinion on
the 2013 budget,” Karoly Bamli, a Budapest-based trader at
Commerzbank AG, and colleagues wrote in an e-mail today.  The cost of insuring against default on Hungary’s debt with
credit-default swaps rose five basis points to 499 according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
