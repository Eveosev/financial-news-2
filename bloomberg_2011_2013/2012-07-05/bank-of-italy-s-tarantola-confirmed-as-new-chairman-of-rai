Anna Maria Tarantola, deputy director
general of the Bank of  Italy , was confirmed as the chairman of
state-owned television network Rai SpA to lead a new board of
directors.  Rai’s shareholders voted to accept Tarantola, the
broadcaster said in an e-mail on its website. Prime Minister
 Mario Monti  first nominated Tarantola for the position on June
8.  With Tarantola’s confirmation, the board will soon be able
to appoint a new director general. Monti had proposed Bank of
America Corp.’s head of corporate and investment banking for
Italy, Luigi Gubitosi, for the position.  Fo  To contact the reporter on this story:
