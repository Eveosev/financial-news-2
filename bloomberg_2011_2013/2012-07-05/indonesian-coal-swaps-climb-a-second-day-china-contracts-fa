Indonesian lower-quality coal swaps
rose for a second day yesterday, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte. The prices for shipments to  China  fell.  The August contract for sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram for loading
from Indonesia gained 10 cents to $63.85 a metric ton on a net
as-received basis yesterday, the energy broker said in an e-mail
today. Swaps for the fourth quarter also climbed 10 cents to
$65.60 a ton. Indonesia is the biggest exporter of thermal coal.  Coal with a heating value of 5,500 kilocalories a kilogram
for shipment to South China in August slid 25 cents to $86.25 a
ton on a net as-received basis, Ginga said. The swap for the
fourth quarter dropped 50 cents to $88 a ton.
for the third quarter rose 25 cents to $86.25.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of  Indonesia â€™s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. The grade is typically softer, with a dull, earthy
appearance, according to the London-based World Coal
Association. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with grades with a better
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
