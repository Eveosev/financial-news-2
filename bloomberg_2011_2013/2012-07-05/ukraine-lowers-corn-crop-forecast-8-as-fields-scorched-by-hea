Ukraine , the third-biggest corn
exporter, lowered its corn-crop estimate by 8 percent because of
hot weather damage.  The crop will be 23 million to 24 million metric tons,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said in an interview in
the capital, Kiev, yesterday. The ministry’s previous estimate
on June 20 was 25 million to 26 million tons. The soybean crop
may climb 70 percent, he said.  “Ukraine increased corn plantings this year but
unfortunately abnormal weather has not left Ukraine aside,”
Prysyazhnyuk said. “For this year we see the minimum corn
harvest of 23 to 24 million tons.”  Ukraine’s corn yields may drop below 5 tons per hectare
(2.47 acres) because of the heat, according to Tetiana Adamenko,
the head of the agriculture department at Ukraine’s weather
center. Yields averaged 6.4 tons per hectare last year, the
ministry estimates.  Corn futures rallied 38 percent since June 15 in  Chicago  as
crop conditions in the U.S., the biggest corn producer and
exporter, worsened on hot, dry weather. Global demand for the
grain has expanded for 16 consecutive years and will be a record
high of about 865.5 million tons in the 12 months ending Oct. 1,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.  Corn Prices  Corn futures have climbed 8 percent this year to $6.985 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest level since
Sept. 20. About 48 percent of U.S. corn was rated good or
excellent as of July 1, the lowest for the date since 1988,
according to the USDA.  Ukraine may export about 15 million tons of corn in the 12
months ending in June 2013, including 4 million tons from the
previous crop, Prysyazhnyuk said. This compares with 13.5
million tons in the previous season.  The country’s exports may come to 14 million tons in the 12
months through September 2013, unchanged from a year earlier and
making it third after the U.S. and  Argentina , the USDA
estimates. The country’s corn crop may rise 5 percent to 24
million tons in the 2012-13 season, according to the USDA.  “The situation is far from optimal,” Adamenko said by
telephone yesterday. “The plants are still suffering from heat
stress. The weather is going to be hot, and the rains won’t be
significant.”  The next six weeks will be important for plant development,
according to Rabobank International, which estimates Ukraine’s
corn crop for 2012-13 at 22 million tons, down 500,000 tons from
the previous season because of lower yields and dryness in the
southern parts of the country.  Corn Production  Ukraine may ship about 2 million tons of corn to  China  from
2013 and targets total exports of about 20 million tons a year
by 2015, Prysyazhnyuk said. Ukraine’s production of the grain
may jump to as much as 37 million tons by 2015 on increased
yields and improved seed and fertilizer use, he said.  China’s corn imports may jump 40 percent to 7 million tons
in the 2012-13 season, according to the USDA.  Japan  and  South
Korea , the top and the third-biggest importer, may also increase
purchases, the USDA said.  Mexico  is the second-biggest corn
importer.  The country’s farmers planted 4.6 million hectares of corn
for the 2012 harvest, according to Agriculture Ministry data.
Ukraine seeks to have about 5 million hectares of the grain by
2015, Prysyazhnyuk said.  Ukraine’s soybean crop may jump to as much as 3.9 million
tons this year, from 2.3 million tons in 2011, he said. Farmers
boosted areas under soybeans by 25 percent to 1.34 million
hectares this year, according to Ukraine’s statistics service.
The USDA forecasts Ukraine’s soybean crop at 2.7 million tons in
the 12 months starting Sept. 1.  Soybean Areas  The ministry expects there to be about 2 million hectares
of soybeans by 2015, Prysyazhnyuk said. The government is
considering how to prevent farmers from reducing barley areas,
with one option involving sales through forward contracts. The
country “needs” to have at least 4 million hectares of barley
plantings and targets annual production of 12 million to 13
million tons by 2015-16, he said.  Ukraine may supply 2 million to 3 million tons of barley a
year to  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest importer, Prysyazhnyuk
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
