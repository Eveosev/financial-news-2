Argentina’s central bank will ban
individuals from buying U.S. dollars for savings, news website
 Infobae  reported, citing officials it didn’t identify by name.  The bank aims to force Argentines to save in local
currency, the Buenos Aires-based website said.  The measure won’t prevent savers from having dollar saving
accounts and certificates of deposits, Infobae said.  Central bank press officials didn’t return phone calls by
Bloomberg seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
