The yield on 10-year Taiwanese
 government bonds  dropped from a five-week high as a report
showed inflation accelerated less than economists estimated. The
island’s dollar weakened.  The  consumer-price index  climbed 1.77 percent from a year
earlier in June, compared with 1.74 percent in May, official
data showed today. That was less than the 1.78 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Most  Asian stock indexes  fell
today after reports showed euro-area services and manufacturing
output shrank in June for a fifth month and services
unexpectedly contracted in  Germany .  “Inflation isn’t as big of a concern anymore,” said  James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “Some
short-sellers are buying back bonds as they see yields can’t go
up too much after all.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 dropped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.225 percent in
Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market. Benchmark 10-year
rates reached 1.232 percent yesterday, the highest level since
May 29.  The  Taiwan dollar  slipped 0.1 percent to NT$29.890 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.740 earlier, the strongest level since June 21. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was steady at 3.8 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.509 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
