Three children died and another 24
people were pulled from the water after a yacht full of people
watching Fourth of July fireworks overturned near  Long Island ’s
 Oyster Bay , Nassau County police said.  The bodies of a boy, 12, and two girls, 11 and 8, were
recovered from the cabin of the 34-foot (10-meter) Silverton
vessel, which capsized between Center Island and Lloyd Neck,
James Imperiale, a police spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview. Police are investigating whether it was caused by
another boat’s wake, weather or overcrowding, he said.  Crews from Nassau County Police, the U.S. Coast Guard,
Oyster Bay police and fire responded to reports of the sinking
about 10 p.m. in Long Island Sound, U.S. Coast Guard Petty
Officer Sondra Rivera said. Boaters in the area also assisted in
the rescue, she said.  Imperiale declined to identify the deceased. He said police
are still unsure who owns the yacht and how many life jackets
were onboard. The vessel remains at the site submerged in as
much as 70 feet of water, he said.  “Everything is still under investigation right now,”
Imperiale said. “Those are the things we’re looking at.”  New York  law requires vessels to carry one personal
flotation device per adult passenger and requires children under
12 to wear them at all times except when in a boat’s cabin,
Imperiale said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
