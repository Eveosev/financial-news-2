The BP Plc-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline delivered 7 percent less crude oil in the first half of
the year, said State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , or Socar, a partner
in the pipeline project also known as BTC.  The line shipped 15.78 million metric tons of oil from
January through June, down from 17 million tons a year earlier,
the Azeri energy producer said on its  website  today. No reason
was given for the decline.  The BTC pipeline, connecting BP’s Sangachal terminal south
of the Azeri capital of Baku to Turkey’s Mediterranean port of
Ceyhan via  Georgia , exports oil from the offshore Azeri-Chirag-
Guneshli field, also operated by BP.  The field, known as ACG, produced 8.8 million tons of oil
in the first quarter, down 8.3 percent from a year earlier, BP
said in May.  Azerbaijan, the third largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, pumped 45.6 million
tons of oil and 25.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
