OAO  Tatneft (TATN) , a Russian oil producer
based in the Tatarstan region, rallied to a three-month high
after Moody’s Investors Service raised its  credit rating  to one
step below investment grade.  Tatneft rose  2 percent to 197.68 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the highest level since April 3. The Micex Index fell
0.6 percent to 1,435.76.  Moody’s upgraded Tatneft to Ba1 from Ba2, with a stable
outlook, according to an e-mailed research note. The ratings
company cited “strong” financial metrics, low cost levels and
“substantial” oil reserves.  “Today’s rating action was prompted by the shift in
Tatneft’s operating profile towards an integrated business model
comprising sizeable downstream operations, as well as its robust
operating and financial performance,” Julia Pribytkova, a
Moody’s analyst, said in the research note.  To contact the reporters on this story:
