Ethanol futures rose to the highest
price in seven months as producers tempered output in the face
of more expensive corn.  Prices increased as corn, the primary ingredient used to
make the fuel, jumped to a nine-month high as the corn-rich
Midwest bakes under a heat wave. An Energy Department report
today showed ethanol production last week sank to the lowest
level since Sept. 23.  “It’s up pretty good,” said Jim Damask, a manager at
Biofuelsconnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative energy
broker. “You’ve got bad weather for corn, so ethanol’s up on
that. We’ve seen producers trimming production because of
margins.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery advanced 4.4 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $2.398 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the highest price since Dec. 5. Futures have gained 8.9 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.38 a gallon and in Chicago the additive soared 7.5
cents, or 3.2 percent, to $2.39, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 6 cents, or 2.5 percent, to
$2.50 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel surged 5.5 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $2.46.  Corn for December delivery surged 36.75 cents, or 5.5
percent, to $7.1125 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Production of ethanol slipped 2.9 percent to 857,000
barrels a day last week. That’s both the biggest drop and lowest
amount since Sept. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
