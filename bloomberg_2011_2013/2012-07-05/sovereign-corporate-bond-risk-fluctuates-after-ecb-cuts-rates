The cost of insuring against default
on sovereign and corporate debt rose after the  European Central
Bank  cut  interest rates  to a record low, while refraining from
announcing additional steps to boost the economy .  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments rose 10 basis points to 279.5 at
3:40 p.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality ; a decline, the opposite.  The ECB lowered the main refinancing rate to 0.75 percent
from 1 percent and cut its deposit rate to zero as the sovereign
debt crisis threatens to drive the euro region into recession.
Speaking in Frankfurt after the decision, ECB President  Mario
Draghi  said the council didnâ€™t discuss other non-standard tools.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 22 basis
points to 665. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings increased six basis points to 165.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers climbed 13 basis points to 268 basis
points and the subordinated index increased 16 to 437.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
