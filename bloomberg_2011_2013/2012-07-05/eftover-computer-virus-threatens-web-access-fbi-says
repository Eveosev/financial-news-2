The U.S.  Federal Bureau  of
Investigation is warning that more than 252,000 computers
worldwide still carry a virus spread by a fraud ring that was
dismantled last year.  As a result, users of infected computers who don’t scrub
their systems might lose  Internet access  next week, the FBI
said.  The virus had redirected users to the thieves’ servers,
said Tom Grasso, a supervisory special agent with the FBI’s
Cyber Division in Pittsburgh. After the ring was broken up by
authorities, the agency temporarily set up “clean” servers in
November to prevent that from happening, a service that’s set to
end on July 9.  An estimated 45,619 computer users in the U.S. still have
the virus, down from an estimated peak of 175,365, Grasso said.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , operator of the world’s largest search engine,
has displayed warnings at the top of its search results for
users with an affected computer since May, said Jay Nancarrow, a
spokesman for the  Mountain View , California-based company.  Computer users may check to see whether they’re infected by
visiting www.dcwg.org, Grasso said.  The virus interferes with a computer’s ability to resolve
domain names, making it appear that users are no longer on the
Internet. Users who don’t fix the problem in advance will have
to call their Internet-service providers for help reconnecting,
Grasso said.  “I don’t think this is going to be like a doomsday event
where there’s going to be panic on Monday,” Grasso said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
