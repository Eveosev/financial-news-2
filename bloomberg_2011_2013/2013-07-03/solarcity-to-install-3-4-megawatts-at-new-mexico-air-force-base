SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the rooftop power
producer that’s tripled in value this year, will install 3.4
megawatts of capacity at a military housing site in New Mexico.  The project at Holloman Air Force Base will comprise more
than 600 homes and is part of the company’s SolarStrong program
to power 120,000 military residences, according to a statement
today from San Mateo, California-based SolarCity. Similar
projects are being built on bases in Texas, Hawaii and  Colorado .  The rooftop power systems will help the U.S. Defense
Department reach a goal of generating 25 percent of its energy
from renewable sources by 2025, according to the statement.  SolarCity slipped 0.7 percent to $37.49 at the close in New
York. It’s quadrupled since its $8 initial public offering in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
