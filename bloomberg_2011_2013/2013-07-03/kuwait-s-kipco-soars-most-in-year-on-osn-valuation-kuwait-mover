Kuwait Projects Co. gained the most
in a year after a Kuwait newspaper reported that Arqaam Capital
Ltd. valued unit Orbit Showtime Network at $2.5 billion before a
possible initial public offering.  The  investment company  known as Kipco jumped 5.8 percent,
the most since July 5, to 550 fils at the close in  Kuwait City .
The shares have surged 48 percent this year compared with a gain
of 34 percent for the Kuwait SE  Price Index . The measure rose
0.7 percent today. About 2.5 million Kipco shares traded, or 1.8
times the three-month daily average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Local newspaper Al-Qabas today quoted a June report from
Arqaam, valuing pay TV-company OSN, in which Kipco holds a 60.5
percent stake. Arqaam also raised Kipco’s price estimate to 640
fils from 480 fils. The company last month named Rothschild the
sole adviser ahead of the potential sale.  “The report is the main reason for the spike today,”
Fouad Darwish, head of brokerage at Kuwait-based Global
Investment House KSCC, said by phone. “It’s complemented by an
overwhelming optimistic sentiment in the market. The average
value traded per transaction is up, which tells us institutional
buying is back, and the market is expecting favorable second-quarter results.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
