JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) , the biggest U.S.
bank, appointed Jeff Katz and Mitch Rubinstein co-heads of
global oil trading to replace Jeff Frase, according to an
internal memo.  Katz and Rubinstein will report to Blythe Masters, the
bank’s global commodities head, New York-based Masters said in
the July 2 memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Marie Cheung, a
JPMorgan spokeswoman in Hong Kong, declined to comment when
contacted by phone today.  Frase will join  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL)  as the head of oil liquids
trading, based in the U.S., said a person with knowledge of the
move who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public. Frase couldn’t be reached on his office phone in
New York after normal business hours.  SparkSpread reported the appointments earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
