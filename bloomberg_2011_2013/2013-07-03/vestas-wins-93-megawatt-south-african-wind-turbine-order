Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  said it won a
93-megawatt wind turbine order in  South Africa , the Danish
manufacturer’s second deal in a month in the African nation.  The order for 31 V112 3-megawatt devices came from
Cennergi, a joint venture between  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  and Tata
Power Co., Aarhus-based Vestas said today in an e-mailed
statement. The machines will be used to equip the Tsitsikamma
community wind farm in  Port Elizabeth , it said.  Vestas on June 11 said it had won a 94-megawatt order from
a GDF Suez SA-led project in South Africa, and Chief Sales
Officer Juan Araluce said three days later that he expected
“significant growth” in emerging markets. South Africa plans
to add 3,725 megawatts of renewable energy capacity by the end
of 2016 and another 3,200 megawatts by the end of the decade as
it seeks to curb reliance on coal for power.  Today’s order includes a 15-year service agreement, Vestas
said. The turbines are due for delivery in the second quarter of
2015, and the power plant is expected to be commissioned by the
first quarter of 2016, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
