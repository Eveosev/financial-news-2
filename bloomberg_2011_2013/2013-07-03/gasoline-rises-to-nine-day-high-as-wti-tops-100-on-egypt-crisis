Gasoline gained the most in two
months after a report that inventories fell and demand jumped to
the highest since August as retailers prepared for July 4
holiday drivers.  Futures rose 2 percent to a two-week high. The Energy
Information Administration reported that  gasoline supplies  sank
1.72 million barrels to 223.7 million barrels, the biggest
decline since the week ended April 26. Stockpiles remained the
highest for this time of the year since 1992. Demand, which
typically increases during the summer as more Americans go on
vacation, rose 4.5 percent to 9.29 million barrels a day.  “We’re going into the peak of summer driving,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  August-delivery gasoline gained 5.49 cents to $2.8382 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on trading volume
that was 6.4 percent below the 100-day average at 2:56 p.m. It
was the biggest jump since May 2.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 67 cents to
$17.96 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent gained 55 cents
to $13.44.  Futures were up before the inventory’s 10:30 a.m. release
in  Washington  as West Texas Intermediate crude topped $100 for
the first time in nine months on concern that the political
uprising in  Egypt  will disrupt oil shipments. Crude for August
delivery on the Nymex settled at a 14-month high of $101.24 a
barrel.  “When you set a time deadline, it really raises the
anxiety level.” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at
Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “We’re all watching. If they
closed Suez, it would be a major disruption.”  Egypt Turmoil  Egypt’s army replaced Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
today with an interim head of state, the head of  Constitutional
Court , Defense Minister Abdelfatah Al-Seesi, said in a
television speech. Earlier, Mursi defied protests calling for
his resignation. The army said July 1 it would impose its own
plan if the crisis wasn’t resolved within 48 hours. Mursi made a
last-ditch bid to retain power with a call for an interim
coalition government.  Gasoline widened gains when WTI touched $102.18, the
highest intraday price since May 2012, after the EIA reported
that crude supplies fell 10.3 million barrels to 383.8 million
and refinery utilization jumped 2 percentage points to 92.2
percent, the most since August.  Refinery Rates  Refiners processed  the most crude and other feedstocks
since August 2005 last week. The increase comes as operable
refinery capacity has jumped 3.4 percent from 2012 to 17.8
million barrels a day, according to EIA data. Motiva Enterprises
LLC more than doubled the capacity of its Port Arthur, Texas,
refinery to about 600,000 barrels a day.  “The increase in inputs is something we’ve been
expecting,” said Eric Lee, an oil analyst at Citi Research in
 New York . “We’ve had expansion in refinery capacity like Motiva
Port Arthur. You can explain the product draws as just stocking
up ahead of the holiday weekend. And some of that implied demand
is export demand, which has been particularly high the last few
weeks.”  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.1 cent to $3.477 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Retail costs have retreated 21 consecutive days, dropping to the
lowest level since Jan. 31.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel, or ULSD, for August delivery rose
4.98 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.9512 a gallon on trading
volume that was 4.3 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
increased 45 cents to $22.71 a barrel. The  premium over Brent 
widened 33 cents to $18.19.  Distillate inventories  fell 2.42 million barrels to 120.8
million.  Distillate demand  rose 14 percent from the prior week
to 4.45 million barrels a day, the highest level since April
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
