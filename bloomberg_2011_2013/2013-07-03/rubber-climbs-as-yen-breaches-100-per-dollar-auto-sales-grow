Rubber extended a rally for a fifth
day as a weaker Japanese currency boosted the appeal of yen-based contracts and growing U.S. auto sales raised demand.  Rubber for delivery in December climbed as much as 1.4
percent to 249 yen a kilogram ($2,473 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange, the highest level for a most-active contract
since June 11. Futures traded at 248.2 yen at 10:29 a.m., paring
losses for this year to 18 percent.  The yen declined to 100.86 per dollar, the lowest level
since May 31. U.S. light-vehicle sales climbed 9.2 percent to
1.4 million last month, according to researcher Autodata Corp.,
exceeding the 1.38 million average estimate of 10 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg.  “Better-than-expected auto sales in the U.S. are positive
for rubber demand,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research
company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today. “A weakening
yen is another positive factor.”  Americans are buying new cars and trucks at the fastest
rate since 2007. Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Group LLC and analysts
said they expect replacement of older models, attractive
financing offers and an improving economy will keep propelling
industry sales.  The yen may weaken further as U.S. payrolls data, scheduled
to be released on July 5, may add to evidence that the world’s
largest economy is gathering momentum, Shigemoto said.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.4 percent to 18,250  yuan  ($2,975) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board fell 1.7 percent to 84.65 baht ($2.73) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
