More than 100 centuries ago, ancient
people transitioning from nomadic life honored their dead by
lining graves with aromatic flowers, mint and sage, Israeli
archaeologists say.  “This is more evidence that as far back as 13,700 years
ago, our ancestors had burial rituals similar to ours,” said
excavator Dani Nadel. The University of Haifa researcher gave
his findings last night, saying that the dig had uncovered what
he defined as one of the earliest examples of a cemetery.  Twenty-nine skeletons were discovered in the Raqefet cave
on the Carmel mountain, which today is part of the Israeli port
city of Haifa. Some 14,000 years ago the area was densely
populated by the Natufians, whose name derived from a stream.  In four different graves dating as far back as 13,700
years, impressions of different species of sedges and mints were
found under the skeletons, the university said in a news
release.  “They laid their dead on a sheet of herbs and flowers that
gave off a pleasant smell,” Reuven Yeshurun, a University of
Haifa archaeologist who participated in the project, said by
phone. “They invested an effort in a ceremony that united the
society. This is a custom that is no longer nomadic and shows
the Natufians were in a very interesting transition stage.”  Muse highlights include  Manuela Hoelterhoff  on arts,
