Stock futures rose in  Hong Kong  and
Australia after better-than-estimated U.S. jobs data added to
signs that the world’s largest economy is recovering, boosting
the earnings prospects for the region’s exporters.  American Depositary Receipts of Cathay Pacific Airways
Ltd., the world’s largest cargo and freight carrier, advanced
0.4 percent from the close in Hong Kong. Those of Woodside
Petroleum Ltd., Australia’s No. 2 energy producer, gained 0.7
percent as crude oil futures surged to a 14-month high. ADRs of
Komatsu Ltd., the biggest maker of construction and mining
equipment after Caterpillar Inc., gained 0.9 percent from the
closing level in Tokyo.  Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  advanced 0.4
percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2 percent. Futures
on Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.2 percent. Futures on
Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in September closed at
14,040 in Chicago, up from 14,020 at the close in Osaka, Japan.
They were bid in the pre-market at  14,000 In Osaka at 8:05 a.m.
local time.  “Equities are still attractive,” said David Cassidy,
Sydney-based head of equity strategy at UBS AG. “While global
economic growth is traveling below long-run trends, it is still
positive and corporate earnings are still growing at a moderate
pace. Ultimately a move to taper quantitative easing because of
ongoing good news in relation to U.S. growth shouldn’t worry
equities.”  Relative Value  The benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 9.8 percent
through yesterday from an almost five-year high on May 20 after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
may reduce bond purchases, or quantitative easing, if the  U.S.
economy  improves in line with forecasts.  The gauge yesterday traded at 12.7 times average estimated
earnings, compared with 14.7 for the  S&P 500  and 12.7 times for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  were little
changed. The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent yesterday as U.S.
exchanges closed at 1 p.m. in New York. U.S. equities markets
are shut today for the Independence Day holiday.  Jobless claims decreased to 343,000 in the week ended June
29 from a revised 348,000 in the prior period that was higher
than initially reported, the Labor Department said yesterday in
Washington. Separate reports showed companies boosted employment
by 188,000 workers in June, while  service industries 
unexpectedly expanded at the slowest pace in more than three
years.  Labor Report  The data came before the government’s monthly labor report
on July 5. That report will probably show employers created
165,000 jobs in June, from 175,000 a month earlier, according to
the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
 unemployment rate  probably fell to 7.5 percent, matching April’s
four-year low.  Futures contracts on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
of mainland Chinese companies trading in Hong Kong advanced 0.4
percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 0.6 percent in New York
yesterday, a third day of losses.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery gained
$1.64, or 1.6 percent, to $101.24 on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement since May 3, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
