Philippine bonds due 2031 fell for a
third day and the peso weakened before data forecast to show the
 U.S. economy  is improving, bolstering the case for the  Federal
Reserve  to taper bond purchases that boost dollar supply.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the
greenback against 10 major currencies, touched the highest level
since June 2010 ahead of reports today that will show employers
added the most workers in June since February and  service
industries  grew at the fastest pace in three months, according
to Bloomberg surveys. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor
Amando Tetangco said yesterday authorities are monitoring prices
in the markets as well as fund flows.  “Asian currencies, including the peso, are reflecting the
global  risk aversion  because of this risk on the withdrawal of
the Fed’s quantitative easing,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , an
economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Singapore.  The yield on the 8 percent government bonds due July 2031
rose 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 5.2 percent as
of 4:15 p.m. in Manila, according to prices from Tradition
Financial Services. It has increased 38 basis points this week.  U.S. 10-year yields advanced 39 basis points to 2.43
percent since May 22, when the Fed first indicated it might
taper its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases if there was a
sustained improvement in the U.S. jobs market.  The peso declined 0.3 percent to 43.46 per dollar, Tullett
Prebon Plc data show. The currency touched 44.20 on June 21, the
weakest level since January 2012, and lost 5.5 percent in the
second quarter. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed eight basis points to 7.69 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
