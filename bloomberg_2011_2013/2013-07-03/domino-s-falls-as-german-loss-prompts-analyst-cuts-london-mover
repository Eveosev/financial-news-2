Domino’s Pizza Group Plc (DOM)  declined the
most in three months as three analysts downgraded the U.K. maker
of Hot Dog Stuffed Crust pizza after greater-than-expected
losses at its fledgling German outlets.  The  shares  fell 4.1 percent, the biggest drop since April
3, to 641.5 pence in  London , paring the gain this year to 29
percent. Domino’s was the fourth-worst performer in the FTSE 350
Index, and the volume of shares traded was more than double the
three-month daily average.  The loss in  Germany , where Domino’s has 25 stores following
seven openings in the first half, may exceed the chain’s
original forecast by as much as 3 million pounds ($4.6 million),
the  Milton Keynes , England-based company said in a statement.  That would double this year’s expected losses in Germany,
Douglas Jack, an analyst at Numis Securities Ltd. who downgraded
the stock to add from buy, said in a note to clients. Jack cut
his estimate of pretax profit by 2 million pounds to 48.5
million pounds, including an increase in his U.K. prediction by
1 million pounds.  Domino’s same-store sales in the U.K. rose 6.1 percent in
the second quarter and 6.4 percent in the first half. First-half
revenue in the U.K. rose almost 12 percent to 147.6 million
pounds, it said.  Domino’s U.K. stores include 634 in  England  and 51 outlets
in  Scotland . Sales from the Internet and mobile devices
accounted for 63 percent of U.K. sales in the first half, up
from 52 percent a year earlier, the company said.  Franchise Margins  The drivers of first-half same-store sales growth may not
be sustainable and may hurt franchise margins, said Wayne Brown,
an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Ltd. who cut his recommendation
to sell from hold and lowered his 12-month price prediction to
550 pence from 570 pence.  The key to full-year success will be the “ability to
maintain margins against a backdrop of increased promotions and
input cost rises,” Brown said. The trading update was
“disappointing,” as growth in Germany will probably be “much
more muted than originally anticipated,” he said.  Jeffrey Harwood, an analyst at Oriel Securities Ltd., cut
his recommendation to hold from add.  To contact the reporter on this story:
