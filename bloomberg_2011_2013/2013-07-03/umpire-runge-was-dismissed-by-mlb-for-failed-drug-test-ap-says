Umpire Brian Runge was dismissed
three weeks ago by  Major League Baseball  because of a failed
drug test, the  Associated Press said , citing two unidentified
people familiar with the situation.  Runge, 43, a third-generation umpire, followed his
grandfather Ed, who worked in the  American League  from 1954 to
1970, and his father, Paul, who was in the National League from
1973 to 1997.  Brian Runge joined the MLB umpiring staff in 1999, and
hadn’t worked in the majors this season while recovering from a
knee injury. On June 14, MLB issued a statement saying that
Runge was no longer on the staff and Chris Conroy had been
promoted from the Triple-A minor-league level to replace him.
There were no further details in the release.  The AP reported today that Runge tested positive for an
unspecified drug and then reached an agreement to keep his job.
He was released after failing to comply with those terms,
according to AP.  MLB spokesman Pat Courtney declined to comment on the
report. The World Umpires Union didn’t immediately return
messages seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
