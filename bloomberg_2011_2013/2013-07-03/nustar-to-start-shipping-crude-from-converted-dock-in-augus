NuStar Energy LP (NS) , the second-largest
independent liquids terminal operator in the U.S., expects in
August to be able to start shipping crude oil from a converted
dock at its St. James, Louisiana, site.  The dock, which has the ability to load vessels weighing
about 100,000 deadweight tons, was converted to an export dock
so crude transported to Louisiana by rail may be shipped out of
the area, according to the company. Modifications were made so
the dock can load both crude and fuel oil.  The San Antonio-based company is increasing rail unloading,
storage and dock capacity in St. James as production booms in
 Canada  and North Dakota. An additional 799,000 barrels a day of
output in those areas is projected to come online in 2013 and
2014, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  A second train terminal at St. James is expected to come
online in the fourth quarter of this year and may offload heavy
Canadian oil, according to the company. Contracts that are
signed for the terminal may also include commitments for
shipping and storage.  Crude oil shipped from the converted dock may be headed for
a number of destinations.  “We do not control the destination of product from our
terminal and our customers have not provided us information on
their planned destinations,” said Jim Siciliano, vice president
of marketing and business development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
