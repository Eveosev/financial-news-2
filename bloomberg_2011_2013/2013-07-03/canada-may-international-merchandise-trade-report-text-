The following is the text of
Canada’s international merchandise trade report for May
from  Statistics Canada .  Canada’s merchandise imports fell 3.2% and exports declined
1.6%. As a result, Canada’s trade deficit with the world
decreased from $951 million in April to $303 million in May.  Following four consecutive monthly increases, imports fell
to $39.6 billion. The decline was largely attributed to lower
imports of energy products, and metal ores and non-metallic
minerals. Also contributing to the decrease were motor vehicles
and parts, and metal and non-metallic mineral products. Overall,
volumes were down 2.0% and prices, 1.2%.  Exports declined to $39.3 billion as prices decreased 1.0%
and volumes were down 0.7%. The overall decline in exports was
led by metal and non-metallic mineral products, as well as motor
vehicles and parts.  Imports from the  United States  declined 2.0% to $25.7
billion, the first decrease in five months. Contributing to the
decline in May were lower imports of precious metals ores and
concentrates, and precious metal bullion, as well as passenger
cars. Exports to the United States decreased 1.6% to $29.2
billion. Consequently, Canada’s trade surplus with the United
States went from $3.4 billion in April to $3.5 billion in May.  Imports from countries other than the United States fell
5.3% to $13.9 billion. The main contributor to the decline was
the principal trading area “all other countries”, which fell
10.4%, mainly on lower imports of crude oil and crude bitumen.
Exports to countries other than the United States declined 1.6%
to $10.1 billion. As a result,  Canada ’s trade deficit with
countries other than the United States decreased from $4.4
billion in April to $3.8 billion in May.  Lower volumes of energy products lead the decline in imports  Imports of energy products declined 18.4% to $3.2 billion
in May, as volumes decreased 15.2%. Imports of crude oil and
crude bitumen fell 34.1% to $1.5 billion, on lower volumes (-
31.7%). This was the sixth consecutive monthly decrease in
imports of crude oil and crude bitumen, and the lowest level
since March 2009.  Imports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals fell 38.8%
to $777 million, as volumes declined 32.9%. Widespread decreases
in imports were recorded throughout the section, led by other
metal ores and concentrates, mainly precious metal ores and
concentrates, and precious metal bullion.  Following three consecutive monthly increases, imports of
motor vehicles and parts declined 4.7% to $6.9 billion in May.
Passenger cars and light trucks was the main contributor,
falling 8.9%, entirely on lower volumes.  Imports of metal and non-metallic mineral products
decreased 8.5% to $3.3 billion. Unwrought precious metals and
precious metal alloys declined 34.0% to $624 million on lower
volumes and prices.  Exports of unwrought precious metals and precious metal alloys
fall in May  Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products declined
15.0% to $4.2 billion in May. The main contributor to the
section’s decrease was unwrought precious metals and precious
metal alloys, which fell 34.9% to $1.4 billion on lower volumes
(-33.2%).  Exports of motor vehicles and parts declined 3.8% to $5.4
billion; volumes were down 3.9%. Passenger cars and light trucks
led the overall decline, down 4.3% to $3.7 billion.  Exports of energy products increased 1.2% to $9.2 billion.
A 3.3% gain in exports of crude oil and crude bitumen was
partially offset by decreases in refined petroleum energy
products (-7.0%) and natural gas (-6.2%).  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States,  Japan  and the  United Kingdom . Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula (2007=100).  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=eng ) .  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data are revised with the
release of the January, February and March reference months.
Revisions to BOP based data for the previous four years were
released in June with the April reference month.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
section with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables.  To contact the reporter on this story:
