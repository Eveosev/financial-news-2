Argentina, which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to
receive a spot cargo from  Belgium , ship-tracking data shows.  The Methania, with a capacity of about 131,000 cubic
meters, is on its way to Recalada port near  Buenos Aires ,
according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. It was scheduled to arrive yesterday.  The vessel sailed from Belgium’s LNG  terminal  in Zeebrugge,
where it loaded the supercooled natural gas and departed June
13, the data shows. The facility is used by traders to store and
export supplies from Belgium, which doesn’t produce its own LNG.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s largest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. YPF closed a tender on May 6 to buy seven cargoes for
delivery to  Bahia Blanca . Enarsa and YPF have issued seven spot
tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
