Ibovespa  futures  fell after  Brazil ’s
state-owned oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3)  said crude and
gas output dropped in May and as concern mounted that growth
will falter in China, Brazil’s top trading partner.  Smiles SA (SMLE3) , the frequent-flier unit of airline Gol Linhas
Aereas Inteligentes SA, may move after it was rated the
equivalent of buy in new coverage at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Education company Kroton Educacional SA may be active after
saying it plans to buy back as many as 6.7 million shares over
the next 12 months.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August sank 1
percent to 44,405 at 9:27 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened
0.5 percent to 2.2665 per dollar.  “We expect a negative reaction from Petrobras shares on
the back of weak production data in May,” JPMorgan’s analysts
including Caio Carvalhal wrote in a note to clients.  Chinese stocks retreated as the country’s non-manufacturing
purchasing managers’ index fell to 53.9 in June from 54.3 in
May, according to a statement from the Beijing-based National
Bureau of Statistics and the  China  Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing.  The Ibovespa slumped into a bear market on June 11 after
falling more than 20 percent from this year’s peak on Jan. 3. It
has since extended those losses to 29 percent. Brazil’s
benchmark equity gauge trades at 10.9 times analysts’  earnings
estimates  for the next four quarters, compared with 9.7 for the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 8.75 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.99 billion
reais this year through July 1, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
