Euro-area services  contracted at a
faster pace than initially estimated in June, as the 17-nation
currency bloc struggled to emerge from a record-long recession.  An index of activity in the services industry based on a
survey of purchasing managers rose to 48.3 from 47.2 in May,
London-based Markit Economics said in a report today. That’s
below an initial estimate of 48.6 on June 20. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  Manufacturing output  contracted less than initially
estimated in June, with Markit’s gauge up to 48.8 from 48.3 in
May, above an initial estimate of 48.7. A  composite index  of
activity in both industries rose to 48.7 from 47.7 in May.  The euro-zone economy’s 18-month recession probably ended
in the second quarter, as the economy stagnated before returning
to growth in the following three months, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
