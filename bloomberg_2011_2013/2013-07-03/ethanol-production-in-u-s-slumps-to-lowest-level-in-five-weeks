U.S. ethanol  production  fell 2.5
percent last week to the lowest level since May 24, the Energy
Information Administration said.  Output slumped to 863,000 barrels a day in the biggest drop
since April 12, while  inventories  tumbled 5.2 percent to 15.4
million, the lowest level in records going back three years,
said the EIA, the Energy Departmentâ€™s research arm.  There were no U.S.  imports  of the fuel in the week ended
June 28, compared with the purchase of 38,000 barrels a day in
the previous period.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, down from about 95 percent.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 4 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.45 a gallon at 10:48 a.m.  New York  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are up 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
