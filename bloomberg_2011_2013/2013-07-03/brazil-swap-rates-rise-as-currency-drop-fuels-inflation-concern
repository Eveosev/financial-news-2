Brazil ’s swap rates rose for the
first time in three days as the real’s deepening losses fueled
speculation policy makers will maintain the pace of borrowing-cost increases to tame inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2017 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.86 percent at 9:34
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real depreciated 0.5 percent after losing
1.1 percent yesterday. It fell 9.4 percent in the second
quarter, the worst performance among emerging-market currencies.  Concern the  European debt crisis  is worsening weakened the
real and other emerging-market currencies as investors sought
refuge in the greenback. Swap rates fell the most in a week
yesterday after the national statistics agency said industrial
production contracted more than analysts forecast in May.  “The international market is more cautious today,”
 Vladimir Caramaschi , the chief strategist at Credit Agricole
Brasil SA DTVM, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “With the dollar
gaining, this idea that a slowdown in economic activity will
cool inflation and open space for the central bank to not raise
rates as much is very doubtful.”  Policy makers have increased the benchmark rate twice this
year from a record low 7.25 percent, lifting it by 25 basis
points in April and an additional 50 basis points to 8 percent
in May.  Brazilian consumer prices rose 6.67 percent in the 12
months through mid-June, above the upper limit of the central
bank’s target range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
