Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc., the operator
of the second-largest U.S. equity market, will provide Borsa
Istanbul AS with the technology to operate its stock market
under a new partnership agreement between the two companies.  Nasdaq will offer trading, clearing, market surveillance
and risk-management technology to the Turkish exchange, the
company said in  a statement  on its website today.  “The opportunity to provide not only our technology to
power the Turkish markets, but also to become a strategic
partner of Borsa Istanbul in order to further develop the
region’s capital markets is a significant moment for our
company,” Bob Greifeld, chief executive officer of New York-based Nasdaq said.  Nasdaq reported first-quarter profit in April that exceeded
analysts’ estimates as revenue from information services and
technology increased. Earnings excluding some items increased to
64 cents a share in the three months ended March 31 from 61
cents a year earlier. That beat the 62-cent  average forecast  of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The information-services division, which accounts for 26
percent of revenue, generated  sales  of $108 million during the
quarter, up from $102 million. The unit covers market data and
index licensing. Nasdaq’s technology-solutions business, which
contributes 18 percent of revenue, recorded sales of $73 million
in the first quarter, compared with $66 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
