French wine production is forecast to
jump 13 percent this year, recovering from the lowest in 40
years as grape harvests rebound in the Burgundy and Beaujolais
regions and the Loire River valley.  Output may rise to 46.6 million hectoliters (1.2 billion
gallons) from 41.4 million hectoliters in 2012, the Paris-based
 Agriculture Ministry  wrote in an  online report  today. The
outlook is uncertain as vines are still flowering following cold
weather, the report showed.  Grapes suffered last year from drought, frost, wetness,
disease and hailstorms. The final wine-production figure was
more than 10 percent below an initial forecast of 46.7 million
hectoliters.  “Due to unfavorable weather conditions for now, flowering
hasn’t yet finished in most regions,” the ministry said. “The
uncertainty in the first outlook is therefore great. Only after
flowering and fruit set can a more precise trend be measured.”  Vines are flowering with a delay of 15 to 20 days in
Burgundy and Beaujolais, three weeks in the Jura area, two to
three weeks in Bordeaux and about two weeks in the Loire valley,
according to the report.  France  had its coldest spring since
1987, according to weather office Meteo France.  France exported 7.84 billion euros ($10.2 billion) of wine
and champagne in 2011, accounting for 14 percent of the
country’s farm and food shipments, government  data  show.  June Flowering  Production in the  Champagne  region is forecast to rise to
2.24 million hectoliters from 1.98 million last year, still
below the 3.04 million hectoliters produced in 2011. Uncertainty
is “very high” because flowering only started at the end of
June, the ministry said.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  is the world’s largest
maker of champagne, with brands including Moet & Chandon and  Dom
Perignon .  Vranken-Pommery Monopole SA (VRAP)  ranks second, followed by
Pernod-Ricard SA and Laurent-Perrier.  Burgundy  and Beaujolais appellation wine volume is
predicted to climb 34 percent to 2.31 million hectoliters, after
vineyards in the regions suffered last year from late frost,
hail, disease and poor fruit set.  Bordeaux-region wine volume may climb to 5.72 million
hectoliters from 5.45 million. The region is France’s biggest
producer of designated-origin wines.  In Languedoc-Roussillon, France’s biggest wine region by
total volume, production is forecast to jump 13 percent to 12.8
million hectoliters, while output in the Loire valley may surge
35 percent to 2.72 million hectolitres, according to the
ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
