Fernando Verdasco  leads second-seeded
Andy Murray 6-4, 6-3, 1-6 in their quarterfinal match at the
Wimbledon tennis championships.  Verdasco is ranked 52 places below Murray by the ATP Tour.
The unseeded Spaniard is seeking to reach his first semifinal at
a Grand Slam tournament since the 2009 Australian Open.  Murray is the reigning U.S. Open champion and was runner-up
to Switzerland’s  Roger Federer  at Wimbledon last year. He’s
trying to become the first British man to win the singles title
at the grass-court championship since Fred Perry in 1936.  The winner will play either Jerzy Janowicz or Lukasz Kubot,
both of Poland, in the semifinals.  Earlier, top-seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia and No. 8 Juan
Martin Del Potro of Argentina won in straight sets to set up the
other semifinal.  Djokovic, the 2011 champion, beat No. 7 Tomas Berdych of
the Czech Republic 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3, while Del Potro overcame
a knee injury in the first set to defeat fourth-seeded  David
Ferrer  of Spain 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
