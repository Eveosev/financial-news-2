Mars Blend, a sour crude produced on
the  Gulf Coast , traded at a discount to West Texas Intermediate
for the first time in more than two years as the spread between
U.S. and global oils narrowed.  WTIâ€™s discount to Brent, the European benchmark, was $4.52
a barrel today after falling to as little as $3.10. It was more
than $23 in February.  Mars Blend dropped to a discount of 10 cents a barrel to
WTI at 3:45 p.m. from a  premium  of $1 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The grade was last at a discount on
Dec. 27, 2010. Mars and other Gulf crudes compete for space at
U.S. refineries with foreign oils priced against Brent.  Poseidon weakened by $1.20 to a discount of 80 cents a
barrel under WTI, and Southern Green weakened by $1.25 to $1 a
barrel discount to WTI.  The premium to WTI for Light Louisiana Sweet narrowed by 35
cents to $6.35 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet weakened by $1.10
to $5.50 more than WTI.  Thunder Horse  lost 30 cents to a $3.50-a-barrel premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
