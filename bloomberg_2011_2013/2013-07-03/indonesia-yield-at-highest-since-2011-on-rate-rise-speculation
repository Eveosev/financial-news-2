Indonesia ’s bonds declined, pushing
the 10-year yield to the highest level since September 2011, on
concern the central bank will raise borrowing costs next week.  Bank Indonesia  will strengthen its  policy mix  at a monthly
board meeting on July 11 as a preemptive measure against
accelerating inflation due to a June 22 increase in fuel prices,
Governor Agus Martowardojo said in a statement on the monetary
authority’s website yesterday. The central bank is likely
indicating it will raise the floor for its  deposit facility
rate , or Fasbi, from the current 4.25 percent,  Destry Damayanti ,
chief economist at PT Bank Mandiri, said today.  “They are signaling that they can be more aggressive in
their tightening,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “Bank Indonesia hasn’t
given details, but it is positive that they still have many
instruments in their toolbox to manage inflation.”  The yield on the 5.625 percent notes due May 2023 climbed
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.26 percent as
of 10:16 a.m. in Jakarta, the highest level since Sept. 23,
2011, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  The  finance ministry  exceeded its target at a bond sale
yesterday for the first time since May, raising 9.75 trillion
rupiah ($976 million) compared with the 7 trillion-rupiah goal.
The government sold 10-year bonds in the auction at a weighted
average yield of 7.20 percent, according to Robert Pakpahan,
director general at the debt management office.  The rupiah declined 0.1 percent to 9,938 per dollar, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It traded at a 2.2
percent premium to its one-month non-deliverable forwards, which
fell 0.6 percent to 10,165, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 57 basis points to 12.17 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
