Copper futures gained as inventories
declined for a sixth day and after the cost of the metal for
immediate delivery rose to the most expensive in a year relative
to three-month contracts, indicating tighter supply.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange climbed as much as 1 percent to $6,976 a metric ton and
was at $6,935.50 at 1:11 p.m. in  Shanghai . The price touched
$6,982 yesterday, the highest since June 19.  LME  stockpiles  fell for six days in a row to 659,200 tons
yesterday, while Shanghai Futures Exchange inventories declined
for the first time in five weeks to 182,493 tons last week.
Copper for immediate delivery traded at a  premium  of as much as
$18 a ton to the three-month contract yesterday as traders
closed out bearish bets amid shrinking availability of the metal.  “The available stockpiles are limited right now, giving
copper the momentum to test strong resistance at $7,000,” Zhang
Tianfeng, an analyst at Dongxing Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai. “Given the low inventory level at Chinese copper
users, short-sellers are cautious at the current level.”  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 50,150  yuan  ($8,178) a ton. Metal
for delivery in September on the Comex was little changed at
$3.1435 a pound.  On the LME, aluminum, nickel, tin and zinc declined, while
lead was little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
