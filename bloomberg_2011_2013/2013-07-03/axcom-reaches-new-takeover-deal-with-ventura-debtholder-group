Maxcom Telecomunicaciones SAB (MAXCOMCP)  posted
its biggest gain in more than 19 months after the Mexican phone
carrier announced it reached a new agreement that would lead to
a debt restructuring and a takeover by private equity company
Ventura Capital Privado SA.  Shares jumped 18 percent to 5.24 pesos at the close in
 Mexico  City for the largest advance since Nov. 15, 2011. The
stock reached its highest price in almost four months.  Ventura and related parties will offer 2.90 pesos a share
for Maxcom and will contribute $45 million in capital to the
company, according to a statement yesterday. Bondholders
representing $84 million of Maxcom’s $200 million in notes due
next year agreed to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan that includes a
swap for debt maturing in 2020.  The pact gives Mexico City-based Maxcom a second chance to
improve its ability to compete in Mexico after debtholders
rejected a previous Ventura takeover attempt in April. Maxcom
has less than 5 percent of Mexico’s landline phone market,
compared with about 80 percent for America Movil SAB, controlled
by billionaire  Carlos Slim .  If the deal is completed, it “could generate an important
advance” in Maxcom’s share price, Andres Audiffred, an analyst
with Grupo Financiero Ve Por Mas, said in a note to clients. The
deal “would allow the company to focus its efforts on operating
performance,” he wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
