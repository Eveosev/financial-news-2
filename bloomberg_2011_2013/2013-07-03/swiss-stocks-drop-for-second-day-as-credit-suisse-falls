Swiss stocks  fell for a second day as
the country’s second-largest bank was downgraded by Standard &
Poor’s, and amid political instability in Portugal and rising
crude oil prices.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  fell 2.5 percent.  Geberit AG (GEBN)  slid
1.8 percent after HSBC Holdings Plc downgraded the maker of
toilets and bathroom piping.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  dropped 1.2 percent to 7,641.12 at
10:45 a.m. in Zurich. The equity benchmark has fallen 9.1
percent since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on
May 22 that the central bank may reduce its bond buying if the
U.S. economy recovers in line with its forecasts. The broader
Swiss Performance Index slid 1.1 percent today.  In Portugal, Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  lost both
his finance minister and his foreign minister amid mounting
austerity fatigue.  Secretary of State for Treasury Maria Luis Albuquerque
replaced Vitor Gaspar at the Ministry of Finance. That prompted
Paulo Portas, who leads the smaller CDS party in the coalition
government, to quit, saying the new minister would offer “mere
continuity” of the country’s deficit-cutting plans.  Portuguese bonds slumped, pushing 10-year yields above 7
percent for the first time this year.  Spanish (GSPG10YR)  10-year yields
climbed 12 basis points to 4.74 percent, while yields on
similar-maturity  Italian (GBTPGR10)  bonds rose nine basis points to 4.53
percent.  Credit Suisse  Credit Suisse slid 2.5 percent to 25.05 Swiss francs after
S&P cut its long-term counterparty credit ratings for
Switzerland’s second-largest lender to A- from A. S&P said new
rules and “uncertain market conditions” threaten their
business.  S&P also affirmed its A long-term rating and A-1 short-term
rating on UBS AG. Still, shares in the country’s largest bank
lost 2.4 percent to 15.80 francs.  Julius Baer Group Ltd., the third-largest Swiss wealth
manager, slid 2 percent to 36.45 francs.  Geberit fell 1.8 percent to 235 francs. HSBC downgraded the
stock to neutral from overweight.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 12 percent higher than the 30-day average today, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
