Drugmakers operating in Europe must
disclose payments made to doctors starting in 2016 in an effort
to boost transparency and make patients aware of possible
conflicts of interest.  The new ethical code requires all members of the  European
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations  to
disclose payments made in 2015 by 2016, the trade group said in
a  statement  yesterday.  Each company must reveal names of health-care professionals
and associations that have received payments, the amounts, and
the types of relationships on their websites or on a common
website, EFPIA said. The rule follows a similar U.S. provision
in President  Barack Obama ’s health law.  “This is an important step for our industry, as we
demonstrate our commitment to transparency and secure the trust
of the patients our industry serves,” Richard Bergstroem,
director general of EFPIA, said in the statement.  The  Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry 
started publishing aggregate totals in May of payments made last
year to health-care professionals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
