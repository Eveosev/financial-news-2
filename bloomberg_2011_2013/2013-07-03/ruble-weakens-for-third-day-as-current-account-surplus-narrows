The ruble weakened for a third day
against the central bank’s target basket of dollars and euros,
as  Russia ’s current account surplus in the second quarter
narrowed more than economists forecast.  The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent against the basket to
37.6825 by 6 p.m. in Moscow, when Bank Rossii stops its trading
operations on the market. The currency weakened 0.3 percent
against the dollar to 33.2410, the lowest in more than a year.  The current account surplus fell to $6.9 billion compared
to $25.1 billion in the first quarter, Bank Rossii said on its
website today. That missed the $13 billion median estimate of
eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A deterioration in the
country’s trade balance and companies’ conversion of ruble
profits into dollars were largely responsible for the move down,
according to Bank of America Corp. economist for Russia Vladimir Osakovskiy.  “The scale of the current account weakness will likely
support further pressure on the ruble,” Osakovskiy said in e-mailed comments.  The central bank has spent the equivalent of 111 billion
rubles ($3.4 billion) of foreign currency since May 29 to curb
the ruble’s slide. Bank Rossii, which reports interventions with
a delay and steps up purchases if the ruble weakens beyond
certain levels,  spent  the equivalent of 6.58 billion rubles on
July 1.  Increased Purchases  Bank Rossii may increase interventions to $400 million a
day should the ruble fall below 37.70 to the basket, according
to VTB Capital analysts Maxim Korovin and Anton Nikitin.  “The central bank is likely to provide good support for
the ruble,” they said in an e-mailed note.  The ruble’s three-month volatility added 27 basis points to
11.32 compared with this year’s high of 11.54 on June 21, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. An index of  emerging markets 
currencies, compiled by Bloomberg, declined by 0.3 percent to
93.4582.  The yield on benchmark OFZs due February 2027 increased
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.88 percent.
The rate rose to 8.37 percent on June 24, the highest since July
last year. The Finance Ministry sold all 20 billion rubles on
offer of notes due January 2018 at an auction today.  Brent crude advanced for a third day, adding 1.4 percent to
$105.46 per barrel, on concern that political turmoil in  Egypt 
may disrupt Middle Eastern supply. Russia receives about 50
percent of its budget revenue from the oil and gas industry.  The increase in the oil price is “only temporary,” Igor Akinshin, foreign exchange trader at OAO Alfa Bank in Moscow,
said by phone.  “There isn’t a single idea for the ruble to strengthen,”
he said. “Quite the opposite, we have a robust weakening trend,
supported every day by a new minimum. It’s hard to do anything
about it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
