Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  Chief
Executive Officer Gerald L. Hassell and other officers and
directors won dismissal of a lawsuit seeking to hold them
responsible for alleged misrepresentations about currency-trading prices.  Shareholders who filed the suit failed to show the
executives knew of wrongful acts, U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan  said in a decision today in  Manhattan  federal court. The
judge also said the plaintiffs didn’t ask the board to address
the issue before filing a case, as the law requires.  “There are no alleged ‘red flags’ that could permit the
conclusion that the board was grossly negligent in failing to
learn how the company was representing its services,” Kaplan
wrote.  Separately, the U.S. government and New York State sued the
bank in 2011 alleging it defrauded foreign currency trading
clients by misrepresenting pricing practices. The alleged scheme
affected thousands of clients, including pension funds and
federally-insured financial institutions, they said.  The suit is pending.  In the shareholder lawsuit, the bank’s officers and
directors faced claims of breach of fiduciary duty, corporate
waste and unjust enrichment, Kaplan said.  Brian Robbins, a lawyer for the shareholders, did not
immediately return a call seeking comment on the ruling.  “We are pleased with the court’s decision,” said Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the New York-based bank.  The case is In Re Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. Forex
Transactions Litigation, 1:11-cv-8471, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
