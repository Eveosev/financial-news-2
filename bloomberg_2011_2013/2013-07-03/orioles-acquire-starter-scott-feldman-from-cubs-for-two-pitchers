The  Baltimore Orioles  acquired Scott Feldman from the  Chicago Cubs  to bolster a starting rotation
that has allowed more earned runs than any other in  Major League
Baseball  this season.  Baltimore traded starting pitcher Jake Arrieta and reliever
Pedro Strop to Chicago to acquire the 30-year-old Feldman, who
is scheduled make his Orioles debut tonight against the  Chicago
White Sox , the team said in a release on its website.  Orioles starting pitchers have allowed 255 earned runs, the
most in the major leagues this season. They also have allowed 84
home runs, 13 more than the next closest starting rotation.
Baltimore, which has not advanced past the divisional round of
the playoffs in 16 seasons, is 47-37 and in second place in the
American League East.  Feldman, 30, is 7-6 with a 3.46 earned-run average in 15
starts this season. He set career highs with 17 wins, 31 starts
and 189 2/3 innings pitched in 2009 as a member of the Texas
Rangers, and pitched in five games out of the bullpen during the
2011  World Series . His seven wins led all Cubs pitchers.  Baltimore also received third-year catcher Steve Clevenger
in the deal and parted with a pair of international-signing
bonus slots worth $338,100, according to MLB.com. Clevenger, a
27-year-old Baltimore native, was optioned to the Orioles’
Triple-A affiliate in Norfolk, Virginia.  A 10-game winner in 2011, the 27-year-old Arrieta will be
assigned to Chicago’s Triple-A affiliate in Iowa, the Cubs said
in a release. Strop, who is 0-3 with a 7.25 ERA, will join the
MLB team this week.  Yesterday the Cubs also traded All-Star reliever Carlos Marmol to the Los Angeles Dodgers for relief pitcher Matt Guerrier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
