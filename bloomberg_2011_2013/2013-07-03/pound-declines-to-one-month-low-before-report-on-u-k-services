The pound fell to the lowest level in
more than a month against the dollar before an industry report
economists said will show U.K. services expanded at a slower
pace in June.  Sterling was little changed against the euro after separate
data showed U.K. shop prices fell the most since February 2007
in June. Mark Carney began as governor of the Bank of England on
July 1 and will announce his first policy decision tomorrow.
U.K. government bonds jumped after two Portuguese ministers
resigned from the nation’s government, pushing  Portugal ’s 10-year yield above 7 percent and boosting demand for the safest
fixed-income assets.  The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.5136 at 8:24 a.m. London
time after sliding to $1.5130, the lowest level since May 30.
Sterling traded at 85.57 pence per euro. It touched 85.94 pence
yesterday, also the weakest since May 30.  A gauge based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
 services  industry fell to 54.5 last month from 54.9 in May,
according to the median estimate of 33 analysts in a Bloomberg
News  survey .  The Bank of England’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee
will maintain its asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of 44 economists before
tomorrow’s announcement.  The pound has strengthened 1.6 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 1.9 percent and
the dollar climbed 3 percent.  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields fell five basis points to
2.33 percent. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in September 2022
rose 0.38, or 3.80 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount to 95.26.  U.K. government bonds handed investors a loss of 2.9
percent this year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg
World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped 1.5 percent and
Treasuries declined 2.7 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
