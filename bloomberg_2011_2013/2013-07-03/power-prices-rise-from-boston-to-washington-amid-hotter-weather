Spot wholesale electricity on the
Eastern U.S. grids gained as heat and humidity spurred demand.  Temperatures from New England through the mid-Atlantic
states will be above-normal over the next week, according to WSI
Corp. in Andover,  Massachusetts . Power demand on the 13-state
grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC, from  New Jersey  into
 North Carolina  and  Illinois , was 5.7 percent above estimates at
2:35 p.m. Texas prices jumped as supplies fell below forecasts.  Spot electricity at PJM’s  Eastern hub , which includes
prices from New Jersey and  Virginia , gained $20.26, or 32
percent, to average $82.74 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended
at 3 p.m. from the same time yesterday, according to grid data
compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday’s day-ahead outlook was $61.63
for the period. The  on-peak average  was up 7 percent at $66.74
from yesterday’s full-day average.  The premium for Eastern hub on-peak power versus PJM’s
benchmark Western hub narrowed to $14.40 from $22.25 yesterday.
On-peak hours are Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.  PJM and the grid operators for New York and  New England 
expect demand in their regions to top yesterday’s highs.  Power
consumption  on the PJM grid was 120,735 megawatts at 2:35 p.m.
versus the day-ahead outlook of 114,196 megawatts.  The temperature in Richmond, Virginia, will climb to 87
degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius) today, 3 below normal, versus 84
degrees yesterday, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State
College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in  Manhattan  today will be 84
degrees, 1 higher than the usual reading.  New England  Boston power increased $33.46, or 85 percent, to $72.92 a
megawatt-hour for the hour ended at 3 p.m. from the same time
yesterday. The  on-peak average  was up 10 percent at $42.21 from
yesterday’s full-day average.  New York  power climbed $12.24, or
26 percent, to $59.59 a megawatt-hour. The  on-peak average  was
up 51 percent at $60.63 a megawatt-hour.  The premium of New York power to Boston widened to $18.42
from $1.95 yesterday, the most since June 27.  Spot electricity more than tripled across Texas in early
afternoon trading as demand topped forecasts and  supplies 
dropped below yesterday’s outlook, according to data from the
Electric Reliability Council of Texas Inc.  Demand  on the main state grid was 51,816 megawatts at 1:54
p.m., above the  day-ahead outlook  of 51,484 megawatts for the
hour.  Wind generation  plunged to 505 megawatts during the hour
ended at 1 p.m. Central time, less than half the estimate of
1,040 megawatts for the period, according to Ercot.  Texas Power  The Ercot  North hub , which includes the Dallas-Fort Worth
metropolitan area, gained $5.36, or 15 percent, to $41.48 a
megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 2 p.m. local time from a
day earlier.  The  on-peak average  was up 11 percent at $38.68.  Spot prices surged to $780 for five minutes just before 1
p.m. because of “an increase in generation that was needed when
wind power output dropped slightly during that period,” Robbie
Searcy, a spokeswoman for Ercot in Austin, said in an e-mail.
“There were no overall supply issues or significant loss of
generation at that time.”  California prices slumped as extreme heat in the northern
part of the state abated and demand fell below the grid
operator’s  forecasts .  Northern California’s  NP15 hub  slid $2.32, or 6.2 percent,
to $34.95 a megawatt-hour for the hour ended at 11 a.m. local
time from a day earlier. Southern California’s  SP15 hub  dropped
$10.83, or 21 percent, to $39.90.  Power at SP15 traded at a  premium  of $1.67 a megawatt-hour
to NP15, compared with a discount of 69 cents yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
