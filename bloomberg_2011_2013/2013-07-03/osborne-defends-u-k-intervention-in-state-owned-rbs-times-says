Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  defended the right of the U.K. government to intervene
in the running of state-owned  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc , the
Times reported, citing an event hosted by the newspaper.  “I represent the taxpayer,” Osborne said yesterday,
according to the London-based newspaper. “It’s a very important
bank for our country, it’s the largest lender to small business
in our country, so of course we’re interested in the health of
the bank.”  Osborne was responding to a suggestion at the same
conference by opposition Labour Treasury spokesman Ed Balls that
the government had mishandled the removal of former Chief
Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  last month.  To a suggestion that he was pushing the bank to play a
greater role in the economy, the newspaper reported Osborne as
saying people “have to understand that I’m running not just a
 Finance Ministry  but an Economics Ministry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
