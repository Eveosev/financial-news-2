Portuguese  stocks  tumbled the most
since October 2008, after the leader of the second-largest party
in the country’s coalition resigned, undermining the
government’s ability to conduct business.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA declined the most in four
weeks. Banco BPI SA retreated the most since November 2011.
Banco Espirito Santo SA lost the most in three months. A gauge
of banking shares had the biggest decline of the 19 industry
groups on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The benchmark  PSI 20 Index (PSI20)  slid 6.8 percent to 5,153.15 at
10:02 a.m. in Lisbon. Portuguese borrowing costs topped 8
percent for the first time this year after mounting opposition
to budget cuts prompted the finance and foreign ministers to
resign as the nation’s bailout program enters its final 12
months. The PSI 20 has fallen 19 percent since its 2013 high on
May 7.  “The ghosts of the periphery are coming back, we cannot
risk having a resumption of the crisis,” Alberto Espelosin, who
helps oversee $1.5 billion at Abante Asesores Gestion in  Madrid ,
said in a phone interview today. “This will put pressure on the
European Central Bank to do something, to finally expand its
balance sheet.”  ECB policy makers including President Mario Draghi have
said they’ll maintain a loose monetary stance for as long as
needed, while urging euro-area governments to cut their deficits
and boost investment. The  Euro Stoxx 50 Index (SX5E)  fell as much as 35
percent in 2011 as a euro-area debt crisis grew.  Portuguese Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  told voters
in a televised speech from Lisbon yesterday that he’s trying to
hold his government together.  Portas Resigns  Foreign Affairs Minister Paulo Portas, leader of junior
coalition party CDS, quit in protest at the government’s budget
policy. He was the second minister to resign this week after
finance chief Vitor Gaspar stepped down, saying his credibility
had been compromised by the government’s failure to meet budget
targets set by the European Union.  Portas disagreed with the prime minister’s decision to name
Secretary of State for Treasury Maria Luis  Albuquerque  as a
replacement for Gaspar, saying it would mean a continuation of
the policies deepening the country’s recession.  Banco Comercial slumped 15 percent to 7.9 euro cents. BPI
declined 13 percent to 78.4 cents. Banco Espirito Santo dropped
12 percent to 53.9 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
