U.S. shopping-center occupancies rose
to the highest level in almost four years as limited
construction increased competition for retail space.  The vacancy rate at neighborhood and community shopping
 centers  fell to 10.5 percent in the second quarter from 10.8
percent a year earlier,  Reis Inc. (REIS)  said in a report today.
Effective rents, or whatâ€™s paid after any landlord discounts,
rose to $16.68 a square foot from $16.54 a year earlier. Rents
and occupancies were last higher in 2009, according to the New
York-based property-research firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
