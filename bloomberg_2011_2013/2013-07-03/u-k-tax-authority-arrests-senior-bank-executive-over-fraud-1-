U.K. tax authorities  arrested a 63-year-old senior bank executive at a home in London on suspicion
of tax fraud.  The case concerns a personal tax return and isn’t related
to his employer, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs said in a
statement on its website today. HMRC didn’t identify the banker
in its statement. A spokeswoman declined to comment further.  “Tax fraud is a serious crime and HMRC will not hesitate
to take action and investigate where we find evidence of someone
not playing by the rules,” said Alan Lee, deputy director of
criminal investigation at HMRC. “Further information cannot be
provided at this stage as our investigation is ongoing.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said in May HMRC
was closing in on wealthy individuals and companies seeking to
evade tax. The Treasury is trying to raise revenue as it seeks
to narrow Britain’s budget deficit.  If found guilty, the executive might face a jail term of as
much as seven years, have his assets confiscated and pay back
any evaded tax, said Ray McCann, a partner at Pinsent Mason LLP,
a  London  law firm, who worked for HMRC for 31 years.  In recent years, the HMRC has taken a harder look at tax
shelters and is investigating them with its criminal division,
said McCann, who isn’t a lawyer.  “There’s been a shift in their posture in how they’re
looking at the scheme,” McCann said. “They’re looking at a
wider number of schemes right from the start and saying, does
this scheme rely on fraud?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
