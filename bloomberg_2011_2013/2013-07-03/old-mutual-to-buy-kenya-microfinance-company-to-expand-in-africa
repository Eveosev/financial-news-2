Old Mutual Plc (OML) , the U.K.’s third-largest insurer, said it plans to buy a controlling stake in
Kenyan lender Faulu  Kenya  DTM Ltd. to tap growth in  Africa .  The acquisition of the first deposit-taking microfinance
company to be licensed by the Central Bank of Kenya is expected
to be completed this year, London-based Old Mutual said in a
statement today. While the price wasn’t disclosed, the insurer
said the purchase was part of the 5 billion rand ($497 million)
set aside in March for expansion in Africa.  “We are building on our existing business in Kenya with a
significant extension of our distribution and product offering
through this transaction,” Old Mutual Chief Executive Officer
Julian Roberts said in the statement. “This is a further step
in executing our strategy of expanding our African footprint.”  Old Mutual, which started in South Africa more than 100
years ago, is building its operations on the continent as
 emerging markets  contribute the bulk of the insurer’s earnings.
Faulu is East Africa’s second-largest microfinance company with
more than 400,000 customers and 100 outlets, Old Mutual said.  Old Mutual dropped 2.9 percent to 178.9 pence as of 12:05
p.m. in London compared with a 1.5 percent decline in the 28-member Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
