Oil and gas  rigs  in the U.S. advanced
by nine to 1,757, the first gain in three weeks, according to
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  increased by five to 1,395, the Houston-based
field services company said on its website. Gas rigs were up two
to 355, and miscellaneous rigs rose two to seven.  The  total count  remained unchanged in the second quarter
after five straight declines, potentially foreshadowing a
rebound in activity and an increase in field-services demand as
producers respond to this year’s rise in both oil and natural
gas prices. June was the most active month for U.S. land
drilling permits in more than a year, according to a  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  research note.  “With a frustratingly slow expansion of the land rig count
to start the year, most investors demonstrated skepticism that
demand prospects were improving for service providers throughout
most U.S. basins,” James West, an analyst for the Barclays
investment-banking unit in  New York , said in the note yesterday.
“Permitting activity, which typically leads drilling activity
by several months, has been strong. We think gains in the rig
count will accelerate.”  Natural gas for August delivery rose 0.5 cent to $3.659 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , up 26 percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  gained 72 billion cubic feet in the
week ended June 28 to 2.605 trillion, the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
today. Supplies are 16 percent below year-earlier levels.  Oil Output  U.S. oil output climbed 6,000 barrels a day to 7.27 million
last week, EIA data show. Production reached 7.37 million
barrels a day in the week ended May 3, the most since 1992.
Stockpiles dropped for the first time in four weeks, falling
10.3 million barrels to 383.8 million, the EIA said.  Crude for August delivery rose $1.54, or 1.5 percent, to
$101.14 a barrel today on the Nymex, up 15 percent in the past
year. Oil rose above $100 a barrel for the first time in nine
months as  Egypt ’s political showdown escalated and supplies
declined.  A boom in U.S. gas and oil output, driven largely by
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, helped the nation
meet 89 percent of its energy needs in March, the highest
monthly rate since April 1986, Energy Information Administration
data show.  Exco Resources Inc. (XCO) , based in  Dallas , agreed to buy
 Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  assets in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville
shale formations for about $1 billion, the company said in a
statement today. Exco is adding the equivalent of 6,100 barrels
of oil production a day in the Eagle Ford and 114 million cubic
feet of natural gas in the Haynesville, the statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
