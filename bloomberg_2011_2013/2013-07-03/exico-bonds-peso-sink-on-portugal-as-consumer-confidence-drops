 Mexico’s local bonds fell, pushing
yields up by the most in a week, as doubts about the stability
of  Portugal ’s government and weaker  consumer confidence 
domestically pared demand for the debt and the peso.  Yields on peso-denominated debt due in December 2024 rose
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 5.78 percent at
9:57 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The peso depreciated for a third day, slipping 0.2
percent to 13.0733 per dollar.  Emerging-market currencies, stocks and bonds fell today
amid concern that the resignation of two government ministers in
Portugal may derail attempts to implement austerity measures.
Mexico’s national statistics agency reported today that consumer
confidence in June fell to the lowest level since December 2011.  “The market is just being cautious given the news out of
Europe earlier today and the holiday in the U.S. tomorrow,”
Vivienne Taberer, a  money manager  at Investec Asset Management,
said in an e-mailed response to questions. “The weaker Mexican
consumer confidence number is also contributing.”  Markets in the U.S., Mexico’s biggest trading partner, will
be closed tomorrow for that country’s  Independence Day 
celebration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
