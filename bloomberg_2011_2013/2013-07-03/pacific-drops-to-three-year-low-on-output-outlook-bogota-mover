Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC) , the
operator of Colombia’s largest oil field, dropped to the lowest
in three years on concern permit delays may hamper its ability
to increase output.  The shares declined 1.2 percent to 33,100 pesos at 11:55
a.m. in Bogota. A close at that level would be the lowest since
March 2010. The benchmark Colcap index fell 0.6 percent.  Pacific Rubiales, whose namesake oil field accounts for 60
percent of its production and is Colombia’s biggest, is still
awaiting environmental permits for work in an adjacent area that
the company has identified as a potential source of future
output. The company’s current contract for the Rubiales field
expires in 2016.  “You need to find production beyond Rubiales because time
is running out,” Ian Macqueen, an equity analyst at CIBC World
Markets in Calgary, said in a telephone interview. “The longer
you leave it and don’t have production to backfill, the worse it
looks.”  Environmental regulators, in response to concerns from
rancher families, are requiring that the Bogota-based oil
company limit the number of roads it builds and restrict its use
of water in the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
