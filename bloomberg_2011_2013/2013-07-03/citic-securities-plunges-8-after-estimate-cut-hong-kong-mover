Citic Securities Co. (6030) , China’s largest
brokerage by market value, fell to the lowest in almost two
years in  Hong Kong  trading after Credit Suisse AG cut its profit
estimate by 12 percent.  Citic fell  as much as 8 percent to HK$12.24, the lowest
since October 2011, the month it started trading in the city,
and traded at HK$12.36 at 3:31 p.m. The benchmark  Hang Seng
Index  fell 2 percent.  “The Chinese regulator has put IPO issuances on hold since
last October and this is having a prolonged impact on the
brokers, and especially on their 2013 earnings,” Frances Feng
and Arjan Van Veen wrote in a note, cutting their share price
estimate to HK$14.50 from HK$16.50. “We expect Citic to see the
biggest hit given the scale of its investment banking
business.”  The China Securities Regulatory Commission is drafting new
rules for share sales to beef up investor protection, and has
rebuked or punished at least three brokerages for inadequate due
diligence on IPOs. The country’s stocks entered a  bear market 
June 24, plunging on concern a cash squeeze will hurt economic
growth. China’s Shanghai Composite index declined today for the
first time in four days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
