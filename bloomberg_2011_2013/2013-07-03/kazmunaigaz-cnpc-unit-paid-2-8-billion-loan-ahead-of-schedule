A joint venture between KazMunaiGaz
National Co. and China National Petroleum Corp. paid back $2.8
billion originally borrowed from Export-Import Bank of China to
buy Kazakh oil producer Mangistaumunaigas.  Mangistau Investments B.V. borrowed the cash in November
2009 and was due to repay it in 2019, state-owned KazMunaiGaz
said today in a  statement  on its website. The loan was paid from
the revenue of Mangistaumunaigas, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
