Crude options volatility jumped to
the highest level since April as unrest in  Egypt  and lower U.S.
stockpiles propelled crude futures to the most in 14 months.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options, was 24.14 percent on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange as of 4 p.m., the highest since April 17 and up from
20.49 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery advanced
$1.64, or 1.7 percent, to $101.24 on the Nymex, the largest
settlement since May 2012.  Crude rose amid concern supplies would be disrupted by
political turmoil in Egypt, which resulted in the announced
ouster by the military of President Mohamed Mursi after the
close of trading today. Gains widened after the Energy
Information Administrated said  crude supplies  fell 10.3 million
barrels to 383.8 million last week and  refiners processed  the
most crude and other feedstocks since August 2005.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
September $90 puts, which were unchanged at 49 cents a barrel on
volume of 10,433 lots traded at 4:05 p.m. August $105 calls were
the second-most active, gaining 40 cents to 63 cents a barrel on
volume of 4,322 contracts.  More Puts  Puts accounted for 51 percent of electronic trading volume
and were three of the four most widely traded contracts. In the
prior session, bearish bets made up 51 percent of 166,934
contracts exchanged.  December $105 calls were the most-active options yesterday,
with 7,492 contracts changing hands. They rose 34 cents to $1.74
a barrel. August $90 puts declined 5 cents to 5 cents on 6,299
lots.  Open interest was highest for September $85 puts, with
39,075 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 37,285 lots
and December $105 calls with 35,244.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
