Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL)  will add flights
to  San Francisco  and Toronto from next year as Ireland’s
national carrier seeks to grab a bigger slice of a lucrative
trans-Atlantic market in which it was once a major player.  Five weekly services between Dublin and San Francisco will
begin in March using Airbus SAS A330-200 wide-body jets, while a
single-aisle Boeing Co. 757 will fly daily to  Canada ’s largest
city starting next summer and four times weekly in the winter.  Two more 757s out of three leased from ASL Aviation Group
will be based in Shannon in western Ireland and used to almost
double frequencies to  Boston  and  New York . The narrow-body will
permit year-round operation of routes currently viable only in
the summer with the bigger A330, Aer Lingus said in a statement.  The additional services will increase the carrier’s trans-Atlantic capacity by 24 percent next year and mean it will be
serving  North America  with 10 daily flights, Chief Executive
Officer Christoph Mueller said in the release.  Aer Lingus first operated across the Atlantic in the 1950s,
at a time when flights from the U.S. were compelled to stop at
the western edge of  Europe  to refuel. Boeing 747 jumbos were
added to the fleet to serve North America in the 1970s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
