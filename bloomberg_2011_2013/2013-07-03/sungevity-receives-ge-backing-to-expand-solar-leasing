General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s
largest maker of power-generation equipment, participated in a
$15 million equity investment in the solar financing company
Sungevity Inc.  The funding will help the company expand into additional
markets, Oakland California-based Sungevity said today in a
statement. The other participants in the funding round weren’t
identified.  GE’s support is a vote of confidence in Sungevity’s
business, Andrew Birch, the solar company’s chief executive
officer, said today in an interview. As prices for photovoltaic
panels fall, so will his costs to install power systems, and
demand will grow.  “The average cost of solar is going to be lower than the
average U.S. retail electricity prices in the next two years,”
said Birch. “Prices have fallen really fast, more aggressively
than we originally thought.”  The average  price  for solar panels is 83 cents a watt,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, down 9.8 percent from a
year ago.  Sungevity leases rooftop solar system in nine U.S. states,
Australia and  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
