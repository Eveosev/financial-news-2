Portugal roiled global markets.  BlackBerry extended its loss to 33 percent in the three
sessions since reporting disappointing sales for its Z10
smartphone on June 28.  Sandvine Corp. (SVC) , a broadband network tools
provider, slumped 7.6 percent as second-quarter sales missed
estimates. Alamos Gold Inc. rose 4 percent as the price of the
precious metal advanced.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 32.70

hand and whether it will spread into other countries,” said

manage about C$800 million ($759 million). “In Portugal, two
members resigned and they’re worried about that spreading to
Spain as well. The sovereign debt issue appears to be flaring up
in Europe. There’s a lot of uncertainty right now, in the
context of a long weekend in the U.S., so we expect the market
between now and when you come in on Monday to be very
volatile.”  The MSCI All-Country World Index dropped 0.5 percent as
 Egypt ’s military ousted President Mohamed Mursi from power,
suspended the constitution and announced an early presidential
election in a bid to resolve the political crisis that has
polarized the nation. Oil spiked to a 14-month high amid concern
the turmoil will disrupt shipments in the Suez Canal. Portugal’s
