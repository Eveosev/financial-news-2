A $140 million venture-capital fund
to focus on early-stage Israeli startups has been set up by
veteran technology investors Eden Shochat and Michael Eisenberg.  The fund will have a particular interest in big data, large
data sets that may be difficult to handle and interpret using
traditional applications. The fund’s creators have “a desire to
build a lasting franchise and business in  Israel  that will help
grow big Israeli companies,” Eisenberg said by e-mail.  The Aleph fund, named after the first letter in the Hebrew
alphabet, “wants to partner with entrepreneurs who want to
change the world,” according to a statement.  Eisenberg, who was at  Benchmark Capital , whose investments
included website toolmaker Wix.com Inc., declined to name
Aleph’s backers. Eisenberg “will continue to serve on the
boards of his current Benchmark investments and will manage out
the Benchmark Israel fund,” according to the statement.  Shochat has worked at Genesis Partners and was a co-founder
of Face.com, a facial-recognition company acquired by Facebook
Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
