U.S. stock futures pared losses after
a report showed fewer Americans filed claims for
 unemployment benefits  last week, indicating employers are
holding off on firings as growth prospects improve.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September slipped 0.2 percent to 1,604.10 at 8:33 a.m. in  New
York .  Jobless claims decreased by 5,000 to 343,000 in the week
ended June 29 from a revised 348,000 in the prior period that
was higher than initially reported, the Labor Department said
today in  Washington . The Bloomberg survey median called for
345,000 claims.  A separate report showed companies in the U.S. boosted
employment by 188,000 workers in June, according to Roseland,
New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute. The median forecast of
38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of
160,000. Estimates ranged from gains of 100,000 to 196,000.  U.S. stock markets are closed tomorrow for the Independence
Day holiday and will shut today at 1 p.m. local time. The S&P
500 yesterday fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,614.08. The gauge
has slipped 3.3 percent since May 21, the day before Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may taper
bond purchases if the  U.S. economy  improves in line with
forecasts.  Oil surged above $100 a barrel as political unrest in  Egypt 
sparked concern of Middle East supply disruptions and as a
report showed U.S. stockpiles shrank in the week ended June 28.  Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi defied protests demanding
his resignation, hours before a military-imposed deadline.
Clashes between Mursi supporters and opponents intensified with
at least 23 people killed over the past day, according to state-run media. The army said July 1 it would impose its own plan if
Mursi didn’t end the turmoil and meet the people’s demands
within 48 hours.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
