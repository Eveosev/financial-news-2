Allen & Overy  LLP increased revenue
by less than 1 percent to 1.19 billion pounds ($1.82 billion) as
the law firm said it continued to face a “backdrop of
challenging market conditions.”  Profit per equity partner, a key gauge of law firm
profitability, was stable at 1.1 million pounds during the last
financial year, London-based Allen & Overy said in a statement.
The firm attributed its performance to consolidation following
five years of investment, including opening 14 new offices.  “It is a combination of looking for revenue growth,
combined with efficiencies that we’re introducing into the
business, that start delivering long-term growth,” Wim Dejonghe, the firm’s managing, said in a phone interview.  Allen & Overy, the third-biggest U.K.  law firm  by revenue,
is the first of the five U.K. firms known as the Magic Circle to
release financial data for the financial year that ended in
April. The group will report broadly unchanged results over the
next week according to two law firm advisers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
