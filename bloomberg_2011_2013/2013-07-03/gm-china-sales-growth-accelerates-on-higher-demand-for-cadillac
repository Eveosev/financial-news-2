General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest
foreign automaker in China, reported sales growth in the country
accelerated last month, helped by an increase in deliveries of
its Cadillac vehicles.  Sales in June rose 11 percent from a year earlier to
236,207 units, after a 9.4 percent increase the preceding month,
GM  said  today. The Detroit-based company delivered 1.57 million
vehicles in the first half, up 11 percent.  GM, which expects to sell 3 million vehicles in the world’s
largest auto market this year, is investing $11 billion there by
2016 on new plants and products. It plans to build four new
assembly plants to boost its annual capacity to 5 million
vehicles by 2015.  Sales of Cadillacs surged 69 percent to 4,244 units last
month on demand for the SRX crossover and XTS sedan. They
increased 35 percent for the first six months.  GM broke ground last month on a Cadillac assembly plant in
 China , even as it predicts a slower growth pace for luxury
vehicles than the total vehicle market this year.  Sales of premium autos in China is likely to increase about
4 percent this year, or about half the pace that the automaker
had expected at the start of the year, GM’s China chief Bob Socia said in Shanghai last month. GM expects total industry
sales to increase by 7 percent to 8 percent this year.  Sales of Buick-branded vehicles rose 9.5 percent to 62,430
units last month and first-half deliveries climbed 17 percent.
Chevrolet sales gained 7 percent for the month and 6.1 percent
for the half.  Deliveries of Wuling minivans, which account for almost
half of GM’s China sales, increased 10 percent in June and 8.8
percent for the first six months.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
