AMP Capital agreed to buy a 42
percent stake in Powerco Ltd.,  New Zealand ’s second-largest
electricity and gas distributor, for NZ$525 million ($408
million) from  Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP. (BIP)   The deal is subject to approval from New Zealand’s  Overseas
Investment Office  and is expected to be concluded by the end of
2013, Sydney-based AMP said in an e-mailed statement.  AMP is making the investment on behalf of several clients
and funds including the AMP Capital Infrastructure Equity Fund
and the  AMP Capital Core Infrastructure Fund (AMPCINF) , it said. Powerco
supplies more than 420,000 customers in New Zealand’s North
Island. It has 16 percent of the nation’s electricity
connections and 40 percent of its gas connections.  “The strength of the Powerco business and the New Zealand
economy makes this an attractive investment for our managed
funds and clients,” Scott Davies, global head of infrastructure
at AMP Capital in Sydney, said in the statement. “This
transaction offers them exposure to a geographically
diversified, quality asset.”  Brookfield’s sale concludes a process that started when
documentation was sent to potential bidders in April. They had
included AMP, China’s State Grid and the Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board, according to media reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
