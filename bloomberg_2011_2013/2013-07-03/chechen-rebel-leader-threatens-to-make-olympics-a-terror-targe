Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov, who
has claimed responsibility for organizing terror attacks in
 Russia , called on Islamic militants to target the 2014 Winter
Games in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.  Umarov’s earlier call for halting strikes outside the North
Caucasus region had been interpreted as a sign of weakness by
Moscow, he said in a  statement  published today on a rebel
website.  President Vladimir Putin stepped up security in the North
Caucasus region after two ethnic Chechen brothers became
suspects in the Boston bombing in April. Violence in the area is
up, with 147 people injured in armed conflicts in May, more than
twice than in April, according to Moscow-based news and research
group  Caucasian Knot . Sochi borders the mostly Muslim region
that includes Chechnya.  “The attack in  Boston  was at a world-class sporting event
and it seems Umarov sees the Olympics as a similar opportunity
to attract international attention,” Grigory Shvedov, chief
editor of the Moscow-based news and research group Caucasian
Knot, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
