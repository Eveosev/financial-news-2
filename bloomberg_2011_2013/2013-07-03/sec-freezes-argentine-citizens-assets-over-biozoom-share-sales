The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sued 10 Argentine citizens, claiming they illegally
sold millions of shares of  Biozoom Inc. (BIZM) , a company that in April
shifted its business from leather bags to biomedical technology.  The sales, which took place during a one-month period
beginning in May, yielded almost $34 million, $16 million of
which is still in U.S. brokerage accounts, the SEC said today in
a statement announcing an asset freeze. Trading in Biozoom stock
was halted last week.  Biozoom, the Las Vegas-based company formerly called
Entertainment Art Inc., said in April that it was changing its
name and moving from producing leather bags to developing
biomedical technology, the SEC said. The defendants deposited
millions of shares in brokerage accounts between March and June,
claiming they had purchased them from Entertainment Art
shareholders between November and March, the agency said in a
lawsuit filed today in federal court in  Manhattan .  The SEC said in its complaint that the stock-purchase
agreements were false because the Entertainment Art shareholders
had sold all of the stock three years earlier.  “Today’s action, along with the SEC’s trading suspension
order last week, demonstrate the SEC’s ability and commitment to
act swiftly to halt ongoing illegal conduct and preserve
assets,” Antonia Chion, associate director of SEC enforcement,
said in the agency’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
