SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) , the world’s
biggest maker of inverters, said it will eliminate 700 full-time
jobs in  Germany  by the end of 2014 as the photovoltaic market it
supplies shrinks.  SMA Solar has begun talks with its works council to ensure
the cutbacks are handled “in the most socially responsible
way,” the Niestetal, Germany-based manufacturer said in a
statement today. The stock  rose  1.1 percent to 20.22 euros as of
4:35 p.m. in Frankfurt, reversing a decline of as much as 2.8
percent earlier today.  The company, whose inverters are used to convert energy
from solar panels into power that can be transmitted on a grid,
has seen sales plunge almost 50 percent since 2010 as
speculation over possible anti-dumping fees for Chinese solar
products in Europe weighed on orders. By the end of 2014, the
number of full-time positions in its home market will be reduced
to 3,000, SMA Solar said.  “For the first time in many years, measured in euros, the
global photovoltaic market will decline in 2013,” Chief
Executive Officer Pierre-Pascal Urbon said in the statement.
“As market leader, we will be especially affected by this,” he
said, forecasting “an extended period of consolidation in the
solar sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
