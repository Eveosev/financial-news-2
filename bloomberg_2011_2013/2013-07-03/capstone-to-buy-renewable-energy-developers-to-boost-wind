Capstone Infrastructure Corp. (CSE) , a
Canadian power producer, agreed to acquire Renewable Energy
Developers Inc. for C$70 million ($66.6 million) to expand its
wind operations.  Renewable Energy shareholders will receive 0.26 Capstone
common shares and 0.1 Canadian cent for each share owned, worth
C$1.01 a share, Capstone said today in a statement. That’s a
10.8 percent premium over the 20-day weighted average of
Renewable Energy’s shares. Both companies are based in Toronto.  The deal gives Capstone 95 megawatts of wind farms in
operation in  Nova Scotia  and Ontario, and access to 35 megawatts
of wind projects under development. The deal is expected to
close in September.  Capstone also will have the option to acquire another 44
megawatts of wind power under development for C$60 million in
equity funding.  When complete, Capstone will have about 550 megawatts of
operating and contracted power assets in  Canada . The company
also has solar, biomass and hydropower plants, and one natural
gas cogeneration facility. Capstone shareholders will own about
80 percent of the combined company and Renewable Energy
shareholders about 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
