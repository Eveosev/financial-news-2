The yield on  India ’s government bonds
due 2022 climbed for a third day as the rupee fell toward a
record low, spurring concern inflation will accelerate and
reduce the scope for the central bank to cut borrowing costs.  The rupee traded within 1.1 percent of the all-time low of
60.765 per dollar reached on June 26, raising the cost of
imported goods.  Consumer prices  rose 9.31 percent in May from a
year earlier, the second-fastest pace in the Group of 20 major
economies, official data show. Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao cited inflation risks when he kept the repurchase  rate 
at 7.25 percent last month.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes jumped five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.7 percent as of 10:03 a.m.
in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
rate climbed 18 basis points last month, the most since the
securities were issued in June 2012.  “The rate action is dependent on the rupee, which is why
the bond markets are closely tracking the currency’s movement,”
said J. Moses Harding, executive vice president at IndusInd Bank
Ltd. in Mumbai.  The rupee fell 0.5 percent to 59.985 per dollar today,
taking its loss this week to 1 percent. It plunged 8.6 percent
in the second quarter, the most since 2011. A sustained 10
percent drop in the rupee adds 150 basis points to 200 basis
points to wholesale-price inflation, according to a research
note released last month by Standard Chartered Plc.  Bond Outflows  International investors  pulled  more than $5 billion from
local debt in June, exchange data show. India’s monetary-policy
stance will be determined by the evolution of economic growth,
inflation and the balance of payments in the months ahead, the
central bank said in its policy statement on June 17.  “It is only a  durable receding  of inflation that will open
up the space for monetary policy to continue to address risks to
growth,” the RBI said. The next review is on July 30.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose five basis
points to 7.58 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
