LIN TV Corp. (TVL) , the owner or operator
of 43 U.S. television stations, plans to convert into a limited
liability company to reduce its federal taxes.  The Providence, Rhode Island-based broadcaster said the
transaction has been approved by the board and will be voted on
by shareholders on July 30, according to a regulatory  filing 
today. The plan was first announced in February.  The change will allow the new Lin Media to reduce the
liabilities from its gain of $715.5 million on the sale of its
interest in a station venture with Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal.
Investors will receive one share of the new company for each
they now own, according to the filing. Lin TV is controlled by
Royal W. Carson III and HM Capital Partners, according to
today’s filing.  Lin  fell  0.1 percent to $15.78 at the close in  New York .
The filing was made after markets closed. The shares have more
than doubled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
