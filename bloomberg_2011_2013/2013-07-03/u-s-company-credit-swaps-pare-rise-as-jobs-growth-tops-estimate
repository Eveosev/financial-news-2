A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
pared an earlier rise after a report showed employers added more
jobs in June than economists forecast.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
0.4 basis point to a mid-price of 86.5 basis points at 8:56 a.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure earlier climbed 1.7 to an intraday high of 87.7.  Investors view signs of economic strength as an indication
that companies will have an easier time repaying their
obligations. Corporations in the U.S. added 188,000 jobs in
June, according to data from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Research Institute, compared with a forecast of 160,000 jobs in
a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
