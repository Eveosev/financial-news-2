The European Commission said it’s
seeking to curtail investment aid for airports with more than 5
million passengers a year in a bid to lift the burden on
taxpayers and ensure fairer competition.  Investment aid for such airports shouldn’t be allowed, as
investments could be privately funded, according to draft
guidelines published today. The measures are scheduled to take
effect from early 2014, after the industry has been consulted.  “Our aim is to ensure that taxpayers’ money is well-spent
and goes where it is truly needed,”  Joaquin Almunia , the
European Union’s antitrust chief, said in an e-mailed statement.
The new rules will aim to preserve “fair competition regardless
of the business model –- from flag carriers to low-cost airlines
and from regional airports to major hubs.”  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  has been entangled in a series of
disputes with the EU over agreements it struck with small
airports seeking to boost regional development with more flights
and passengers. The EU in 2012 expanded a probe into government
support for  Belgium ’s state-owned Charleroi airport to examine
changes to Ryanair’s contracts on airport access and aid from
the local Walloon regional government.  “A proliferation of regional airports which leads to the
creation of unused or not efficiently used airport
infrastructures should be avoided,” the commission said in the
statement.  The regulators plan to phase out state aid to cover
airports’ operational costs over a maximum of 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
