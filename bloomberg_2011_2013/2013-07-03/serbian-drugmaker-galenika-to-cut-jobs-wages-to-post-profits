Galenika AD Zemun, a Serbian state-owned drugmaker, needs to cut 800 jobs and lower wages by 20
percent to return to profit, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The workforce should drop to 1,200 before the state starts
talks with banks over rescheduling long-term debt repayments,
the ministry said in an e-mail today. The government has asked
the Belgrade-based company’s management to prepare cost-cutting
plans together with trade unions, it said.  Galenika, whose loss shrank to 5.6 billion dinars ($63.6
million) in 2012 from 13.5 billion dinars a year earlier, is
among four companies the government plans to sell to strategic
investors. A unit of Canada’s  Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX)  pulled out of a sale tender on June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
