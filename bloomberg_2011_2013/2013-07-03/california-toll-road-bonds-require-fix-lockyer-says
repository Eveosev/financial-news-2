An agency that operates three toll
roads in Orange County,  California , may default on $2.4 billion
of bonds unless a planned restructuring takes place, according
to a report from state Treasurer Bill Lockyer.  The Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency is set
to refinance some of its debt the week of July 8 as part of the
plan to cut borrowing costs and extend repayment by 13 years.  Orange County’s 51 miles (82 kilometers) of toll highways,
the most extensive system in the state, the world’s ninth-biggest economy, have missed revenue forecasts since opening in
the 1990s. The agency approved the restructuring last month.  Without the restructuring, “the agency is not likely to
meet its bond covenants going forward and without significant
revenue increases, toll revenues would soon fall below the level
needed to meet debt service obligations,” according to
Lockyer’s report.  “It makes sense because interest rates are low and we will
be able to lower annual debt service growth,” Lisa Telles, an
agency spokeswoman, said by telephone. “It makes good business
sense.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
