King Albert II  of Belgium will
announce his abdication later today after almost two decades of
presiding over the linguistically and economically divided
country, Belgian media reported.  Albert, 79, will go on national television at 6 p.m. in
Brussels to announce that he will hand over to his eldest son,
Prince Philippe, on July 21,  De Standaard  said in a report
followed by other media outlets.  Belgiumâ€™s constitutional monarchs play a more prominent
role in public life than other crowned heads of Europe, serving
as symbols of unity and top-level political dealmakers in a
country of 11 million people split between the richer Dutch-speaking north and poorer French-speaking south.  Philippe, 53, is a trained fighter pilot and parachutist
with degrees from Trinity College, Oxford and  Stanford
University . He will take over on the anniversary of the
inauguration of the first Belgian king in 1831.  To contact the reporter on this story:
