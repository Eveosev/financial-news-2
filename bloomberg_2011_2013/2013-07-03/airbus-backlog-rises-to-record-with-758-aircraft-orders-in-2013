Airbus SAS’s backlog rose to a record
after the No. 2 planemaker booked 241 orders last month, fueled
by sales at the week-long  Paris Air Show  that brought in $129
billion worth of deals for airliners.  The order book grew to 5,109 planes after Airbus handed
over 48 jets last month, it said on its website today. The
Toulouse, France-based company said it was the first time a
planemaker had reached that level of to-be-delivered jets, equal
to about seven years of sustained production,  The manufacturer shipped 295 planes in the first six months
as it booked 722 net orders after 36 cancellations.  Airbus won deals worth almost $70 billion at the aerospace
expo last month, bringing it within its target of 800 orders for
the year. Announced commitments, including a pending 135 plane
order from European discount carrier  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , and the
purchase of 20 A380 superjumbos by Doric Asset Finance Ltd.,
bring Airbus to about 1,000 orders this year.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s firmed up a previously announced
deal for 100 A320 single-aisle jets in the largest transaction
last month, leaving the airline to still finalize terms for two
additional A380s it has committed to buying.  Airlines bought 65 A350s after the plane completed its
first flight on June 14. Deals included 30 A350-900s, the model
that flew, from  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  and another 25 from  Air
France-KLM (AF) , Europe’s largest airline, with  United Airlines (UAL) 
signing for 10 larger version -1000s. United also canceled
orders for 11 A320 short-haul planes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
