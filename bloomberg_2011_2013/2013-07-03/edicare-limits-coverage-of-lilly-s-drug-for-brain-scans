Medicare will pay the costs of brain
imaging that uses a  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  drug to help diagnose
 Alzheimer’s disease  only for patients participating in approved
clinical studies, regulators proposed.  There isn’t enough evidence to show the scan will benefit
all people with dementia, though in some cases it may help
diagnose whether a patient has Alzheimer’s, the most common form
of dementia, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said
today in its proposed  coverage decision . Medicare, the U.S.
health plan for the elderly and disabled, will reimburse
patients for a scan if they are part of an approved clinical
trial for the prevention, treatment or better diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s, the agency said.  The $3,000 test, approved last year by the  Food and Drug
Administration , uses Lilly’s Amyvid imaging agent to trace a
brain protein linked to Alzheimer’s. The disease affects 5
million Americans, a number that patient advocates say may
double by 2050. In younger patients or those where the diagnosis
is unclear, the benefit of the scan may be greatest, scientists
have said.  In its proposed decision, the agency set out criteria for
clinical studies that would allow Medicare recipients to be
covered for the costs of the brain scans, including whether
using the test would spare unnecessary treatments or improve the
patients’ quality of life.  To contact the reporter on this story:
