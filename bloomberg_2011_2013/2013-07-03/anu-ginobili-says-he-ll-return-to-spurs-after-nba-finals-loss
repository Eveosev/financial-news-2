Manu Ginobili  said he’s staying with
the  San Antonio Spurs , the only team he’s played for over his
11-year National Basketball Association career.  The 35-year-old Ginobili became an unrestricted free agent
two days ago, less than two weeks after the Spurs lost to the
Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.  “Thrilled to announce that as I always hoped, I’m gonna
stay with the Spurs for two more years,” Ginobili, who’s from
Argentina, wrote on his  Twitter page .  NBA players can agree on contracts, though they can’t sign
new deals until July 10, when the league’s moratorium on trades
and signings is lifted.  Ginobili averaged 11.8 points and 4.6 assists for the Spurs
last season. He’s averaged 14.9 points, 4.0 assists and 3.9
rebounds over his NBA career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
