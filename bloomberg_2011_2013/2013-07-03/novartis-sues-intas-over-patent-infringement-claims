Novartis (HCBA)  AG sued Intas
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for patent infringement, claiming it sought
U.S. approval to sell a generic version of the immunosuppressant
drug Myfortic before Novartis’s patents expired.  Novartis, in a filing today in federal court in  Washington ,
seeks to block Intas and its U.S. unit, Accord Healthcare Inc.,
from importing and selling generic Myfortic in the U.S. until
its patents expire April 2017.  Novartis, based in  Basel , Switzerland, alleges its patents
were violated when Intas filed a new drug application with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking to manufacture and
sell 180 milligram delayed-release tablets of generic Myfortic,
claiming Novartis’s patents are invalid.  The medication is used to treat patients who have had
kidney transplants.  “Defendants products, if approved, will be administered to
human patients in an amount effective to immunosuppress those
patients, which administration constitutes direct
infringement,” Frederick Haughey, a lawyer for Novartis, wrote
in the complaint.  Chid Iyer, a lawyer for Ahmedabad, India-based Intas
Pharmaceuticals at Sughrue Mion Pllc in Washington, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the
lawsuit.  The case is  Novartis AG (NOVN)  v. Accord Healthcare Inc. USA, 13-cv-01013, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
