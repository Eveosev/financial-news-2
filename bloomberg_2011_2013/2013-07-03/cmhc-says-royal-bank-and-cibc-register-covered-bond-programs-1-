Canada ’s housing agency said  Royal
Bank of Canada (RY)  and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce have
registered to issue covered bonds under a new government
framework.  The banks are the first to register under a legal framework
introduced by the federal government last year, Canada Mortgage
& Housing Corp. said today in a statement.  “Having met the requirements of the program, CIBC and RBC
are now in a position to issue the first covered bonds under the
framework,” Douglas Stewart, Interim President and chief
executive officer at Ottawa-based CMHC, said in the statement.
“We expect that other issuers will soon have registered
programs in place.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
