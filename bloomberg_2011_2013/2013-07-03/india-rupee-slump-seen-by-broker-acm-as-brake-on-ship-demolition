A plunge in the Indian rupee to near
a record is curbing demolition of obsolete merchant vessels,
exacerbating a fleet surplus in the maritime industry, according
to London-based shipbroker ACM Shipping Group Plc.  “Indian scrap yards buy old tonnage from owners in
dollars, but sell the scrap metal to  steel mills  in rupees,”
ACM senior analyst Marc Pauchet said in a report sent by e-mail
today. “Mills are finding it increasingly difficult to meet the
prices demanded by recyclers.”  The currency of the world’s largest vessel-scrapping nation
fell 1 percent to 60.24 per dollar as of 3:12 p.m. in Mumbai
today, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s 0.8
percent away from its record low of 60.765 per dollar on June
26. The shortfall in India’s current account, the broadest
measure of trade, widened to a record 4.8 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ended March 31, official data show.  Ship owners are contending with a fleet surplus across the
maritime industry that  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , largest shipbroker,
estimated in March was the largest since the early-1980s. The
Baltic Dry Index, an overall measure of commodity freight costs,
averaged 847 points this year, its worst start on record,
according to the  Baltic Exchange  in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
