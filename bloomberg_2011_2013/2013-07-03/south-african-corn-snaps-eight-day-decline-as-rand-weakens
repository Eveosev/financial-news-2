South African corn futures climbed
for the first time in nine days after the rand weakened against
the dollar, making imports of the grain more expensive.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, rose 2 percent to 2,287 rand ($227) a metric ton, the
first gain since June 20, by the close in Johannesburg. The
yellow variety increased 2 percent to 2,220.60 rand a ton.  South Africa ’s rand depreciated for a third day against the
dollar as growth in  China ’s service industries slowed and a
slump in Portuguese bonds reignited concern Europe’s debt crisis
is worsening.  “The rand’s weakness caused today’s rise in corn prices,”
Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader in Kroonstad in the Free
State province, said by phone.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal from the white variety is a staple food, while yellow corn
is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December gained 1.8 percent to 3,386
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
