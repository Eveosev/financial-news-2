Sony Pictures Entertainment (6758)  and the
four largest U.S. cinema chains are offering military personnel
and veterans free tickets to July 4 showings of the action film
“White House Down.”  Theaters run by  Regal Entertainment Group (RGC) , AMC
Entertainment Holdings Inc.,  Cinemark Holdings Inc. (CNK)  and  Carmike
Cinemas Inc. (CKEC)  will admit military personnel and veterans, plus
one guest, to see the film on Independence Day, the Culver City,
California-based unit of Sony Corp., said in a statement
yesterday.  “It’s a great way to celebrate the holiday and to honor
and thank the troops for their service to our country,” Rory Bruer, Sony Pictures’ president of worldwide distribution, said
in the statement.  “White House Down” stars Channing Tatum as a police
officer whose application to the Secret Service is turned down.
He ends up protecting the president anyway when a paramilitary
group attacks while he and his daughter are on a White House
tour. Jamie Foxx plays the president.  The film, made for about $150 million, has taken in $34.7
million worldwide since its June 28 release, according to
researcher  Box Office Mojo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
