Uzakbai Karabalin, the former chief
of state-run explorer KazMunaiGaz National Co., replaced Sauat Mynbayev as oil and gas minister as the country acquires a
further stake in the Kashagan project.  President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  ordered the change today,
according to a  statement  published on his website. Mynbayev, who
has headed the ministry since March 2010, will replace Lyazzat Kiinov as chief executive officer at KazMunaiGaz, Interfax
reported today, citing unnamed sources.  Kazakhstan  will exercise its right of first refusal and
acquire the 8.4 percent stake held by  ConocoPhillips (COP)  in
Kashagan, the countryâ€™s biggest oil field, the government said
yesterday. KazMunaiGaz will carry out the purchase.  China National Petroleum Corp. will acquire an 8.33 percent
holding in Kashagan from KazMunaiGaz for about $5 billion,
people with knowledge of the matter said June 28.  Karabalin led KazMunaiGaz in 2008 when Kazakhstan doubled
its stake in Kashagan to 16.81 percent, giving the government a
larger share in future profit and resolving a dispute with
partners over delays and cost overruns.  He is currently  general director  of the Kazakh Institute of
Oil & Gas JSC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
