U.S. stocks were little changed as
reports depicting an improving job market tempered concern over
political turmoil in Egypt and  Portugal .  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slipped 0.3 percent to
1,610.03 at 10:35 a.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  swung between gains and losses near the 14,930 level.
U.S. stock markets are closed tomorrow for the Independence Day
holiday amd will shut at 1 p.m. today.  “Today’s data was largely in line with expectations and
isn’t having a particularly strong impact on the markets,”
 Lawrence Creatura , a Rochester, New York-based fund manager at
Federated Investors Inc., which oversees about $380 billion,
said by phone. “Other factors appear dominant. The list is long
but the most important factor today seems to be the events in
Egypt and the collateral impact on energy markets.”  The S&P 500 yesterday fell less than 0.1 percent to
1,614.08. The gauge has slipped 3.3 percent since May 21, the
day before Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank may taper bond purchases if the  U.S. economy 
improves in line with forecasts.  Oil futures surged to as high as $102.18 a barrel, the most
since May 2012, as political unrest in Egypt sparked concern of
Middle East supply disruptions and as a report showed U.S.
stockpiles shrank in the week ended June 28.  Egypt, Portugal  Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi defied protests demanding
his resignation, hours before a military-imposed deadline.
Clashes between Mursi supporters and opponents intensified with
at least 23 people killed over the past day, according to state-run media. The army said July 1 it would impose its own plan if
Mursi didn’t end the turmoil and meet the people’s demands
within 48 hours.  In Portugal, Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  told voters
in a televised speech from Lisbon yesterday that he’s trying to
hold his government together after Foreign Affairs Minister
Paulo Portas, leader of junior coalition party CDS, quit.  Jobless claims decreased by 5,000 to 343,000 in the week
ended June 29 from a revised 348,000 in the prior period that
was higher than initially reported, the Labor Department said
today in  Washington . The Bloomberg survey median called for
345,000 claims. A separate report showed companies in the U.S.
boosted employment by 188,000 workers in June, according to
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute. The median
forecast of 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an
advance of 160,000.  The data come before the government’s monthly labor report
on July 5. That report will probably show employers created
165,000 jobs in June, from 175,000 a month earlier, according to
the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
 unemployment rate  probably fell to 7.5 percent, matching April’s
four-year low.  “Both the ADP number and initial jobless claims were
better than consensus and better than the previous month,” Mark
Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC in Philadelphia, which manages about $58 billion, said by
telephone. “That might signal a better number this Friday on
jobs.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
