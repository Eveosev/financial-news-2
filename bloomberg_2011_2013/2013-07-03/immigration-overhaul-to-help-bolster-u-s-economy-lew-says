A U.S. immigration overhaul under
consideration in Congress would help lower budget deficits, put
entitlement programs on more stable financial footing and boost
consumer demand, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said.  “This bill will drive growth by bringing highly skilled
scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs to the  United States ,”
Lew said in prepared remarks at a naturalization ceremony in
Washington today. “This bill will create a new wave of
consumers who will fuel demand and generate economic activity.
The effect will be enormous. More new businesses. More jobs, and
more exports.”  While the Senate passed immigration legislation June 27,
top Republicans in the  House of Representatives  have said they
won’t take up the Senate’s measure and instead will focus on
narrower bills. The Senate’s plan would create a path to
citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S.,
a measure some  House Republicans  oppose.  Lew, a son of a Polish immigrant, was participating in the
ceremony granting U.S. citizenship to 30 people from 22
countries, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Ghana, India and the
U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
