Kuwait Finance House KSC will start a
$100 million sukuk fund as a slump in global bond markets offers
a chance to invest at higher yields, the chief executive of its
Malaysian asset-management unit said.  The fund will buy investment-grade sovereign and corporate
dollar notes that comply with Islam’s ban on interest from the
 Middle East , Indonesia and Malaysia, KFH Asset Management Sdn.
Chief Executive Officer Mushthaq Ahmad Ibrahim said in an
interview in  Kuala Lumpur  today. It will probably start
purchasing debt this month, he said.  The average yield on Shariah-compliant notes touched 4.17
percent on June 25, the highest since May 2011, the HSBC/Nasdaq
Dubai US Dollar Sukuk Index shows, after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 the central bank may taper
its monthly debt purchases this year and end them in 2014.
Global debt funds recorded an unprecedented $23.3 billion in
outflows for the week through June 26, according to a June 28
report from Citigroup Inc., which cited data from EPFR Global.  “If you’re new money, you can start building a portfolio
around slightly better yields,” Mushthaq said. “The fixed-income market bubble, to some extent, has burst.”  The fund will be managed by KFH Asset Management and KFH’s
unit based in Labuan, Malaysia’s offshore financial center,
according to Mushthaq.  To contact the reporter on this story:
