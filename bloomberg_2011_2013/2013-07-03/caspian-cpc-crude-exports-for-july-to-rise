The Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
operator of the only oil-export link in  Russia  that has shared
foreign ownership, will increase daily crude exports from the
Black Sea in July to the highest in more than two years, a final
loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 2.89 million metric
tons, compared with 2.699 million tons in June, according to the
schedule. That’s equal to 724,490 barrels a day, the most since
November 2010, compared with 699,041 barrels last month.  The program comprises seven cargoes of 134,000 to 135,500
tons each and 23 consignments of 85,000 to 93,500 tons.  The volume in the final program is higher than 2.757
million tons in the provisional plan released on June 12.  The CPC pipeline, in which Chevron Corp. is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from  Kazakhstan ’s western fields to a terminal near Russia’s
Novorossiysk port on the  Black Sea . Russia owns 31 percent and
Kazakhstan 20.75 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO Lukoil and a
joint venture between OAO Rosneft and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are
among the other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
