B2W Cia. Digital, a Brazilian online
retailer, soared the most on record as trading volume surged
after lending for short selling reached the highest level since
at least 2010.  B2W gained 28 percent to 8.63 reais at the close of trading
in  Sao Paulo , the most since the stock started trading in March
2005. Trading volume was five times the three-month daily
average. It was the best  performance  on the Ibovespa stock
benchmark, which dropped 0.4 percent.  Shares that have been sold short and not yet repurchased
rose to 17 percent of the stock’s free float as of the close of
trading yesterday, the highest since at least 2010, when
Bloomberg began compiling the data. The stock surged as traders
bought back shares cover their short positions, according to Ari
Santos, an equity trading manager at H. Commcor.  “It looks like a squeeze,” Santos said in a phone
interview from Sao Paulo.  In a short sale, traders sell borrowed stock, anticipating
the price will drop so they can profit by buying back the shares
at a lower price.  The shares have lost 49 percent this year, while the
Ibovespa has dropped 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
