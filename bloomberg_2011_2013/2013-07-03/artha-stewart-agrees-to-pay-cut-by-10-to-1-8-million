Martha Stewart  agreed to have her
annual pay cut by 10 percent as the company she created
struggles to curtail losses amid a shift from publishing and TV.  Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. (MSO)  changed the
compensation to $1.8 million for its 71-year-old chairman as
part of an option in a July 2012 agreement that extended her
employment until 2017, according to a filing today. Her annual
license fee was also trimmed by $300,000 to $1.7 million, and
the board replaced an old expense policy that reimbursed her for
chauffeur, Internet and home-security services. It didn’t say
what the new expense policy would cover.  In the past year, the New York-based company has suffered
from slumping advertising sales at its magazines and declining
broadcasting revenue following the cancellation of “The Martha
Stewart Show.” Martha Stewart Living, which is trying to focus
more on its merchandising business, is also seeking a permanent
chief executive officer.  Martha Stewart Living, which posted a  net loss  of $3.27
million in the first quarter after losing $56.1 million in 2012,
said in the filing the changes in Stewart’s contract are
consistent with its plan to return to profitability.  The company has in the past 18 months been embroiled in a
lawsuit brought by  Macy’s Inc. (M)  The department-store chain, which
has sold Martha Stewart-branded home goods since 2007, sued
after rival J.C. Penney Co. took a stake in Martha Stewart
Living, saying it had the exclusive right to sell items in
categories including bedding and cookware.  Martha Stewart Living climbed 3 percent to $2.41 at the
close in  New York . The shares have dropped 1.6 percent this
year, compared with a 13 percent increase for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
