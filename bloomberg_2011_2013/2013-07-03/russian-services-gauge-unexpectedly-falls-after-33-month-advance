Russia ’s services industry contracted
in June for the first time since a heatwave disrupted business
in August 2010 as signs mount that wobbly domestic spending
threatens the country’s recovery prospects.  The HSBC Russia Services Business Activity Index dropped to
a seasonally adjusted 48.8 in June from 51.4 the previous month,
HSBC Holdings Plc said today in an e-mailed  statement , citing
data compiled by London-based Markit Economics. Economists
forecast a drop to 51, according to the median of three
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The drop below 50 signals a
“modest contraction,” according to the statement.  The world’s largest energy exporter is failing to gain
traction to halt an economic slowdown that’s cut growth to the
weakest pace since a 2009 contraction. Turmoil on global markets
last month and “fears” of a devaluation of the ruble may have
damaged consumer and business sentiment, according HSBC.  “Service providers have just responded to the past
weakness in manufacturing, with this weakness filtered through
long production chains onto the service sector,”  Alexander Morozov , chief economist for Russia and the  Commonwealth of
Independent States  at HSBC in Moscow, said in the statement.
“Service providers should see stronger demand and output growth
down the road if manufacturing keeps growing like in June.”  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 50 stocks fell for the first time in
four days, dropping 0.5 percent to 1,331.03 as of 10:52 a.m. in
Moscow. The ruble weakened 0.1 percent against the dollar to
33.1925.  Sharp Deterioration  New business volumes dropped in June for the first time
since August 2010, according to the statement. A measure of
expectations for the coming 12 months “deteriorated sharply”
to the worst level in four and a half years, HSBC said.  Russian  consumer spending  decelerated in May, with
disposable incomes unexpectedly shrinking for the first time
since October 2011. Retail sales rose 2.9 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a 4.1 percent increase in April, the
Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
