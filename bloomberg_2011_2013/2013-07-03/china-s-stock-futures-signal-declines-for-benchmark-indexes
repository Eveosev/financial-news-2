China’s stocks  fell for the first
time in four days, led by financial and industrial companies, as
growth in services industries slowed and investors speculated
initial public offerings will resume this quarter.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s
biggest lender, lost 2 percent and developer Gemdale Corp. sank
3.1 percent. Sany Heavy Industry Co., the largest machinery
maker, slid to the lowest level in three years as oil surged in
New York. The non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell
to 53.9 in June, an official report showed, while Credit Suisse
Group AG said regulators may allow share sales by October.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  retreated 0.6 percent to
1,994.27 at the close, paring earlier losses and halting a
three-day, 2.9 percent rally. The CSI 300 Index declined 0.8
percent to 2,203.83, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
sank 3.3 percent, taking its loss this year to 22 percent.
The ChiNext index of small-cap companies climbed 2 percent.  “Leading indicators like  PMI (CPMINMAN)  suggest the economy is still
weak,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong
Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “Uncertainty over
when IPOs will be resumed also weighs on sentiment. The earlier
rebound isn’t sustainable.”  The slowdown in service industries underscores Premier Li Keqiang’s challenge in achieving sustainable growth across the
world’s second-biggest economy through increasing consumption
and reducing reliance on exports and investment. Service
industries accounted for 45 percent of gross domestic product
last year, according to the statistics bureau, up from 41
percent in 2003.  PMI Gauges  The official non-manufacturing PMI from the National Bureau
of Statistics and the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing fell from 54.3 in May to the second-lowest reading
since March 2011, when Bloomberg started tracking the data.
Another service PMI released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics rose to 51.3 last month from 51.2 in May. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  A  gauge  tracking financial stocks in the CSI 300 declined
1.7 percent, the most among the 10 industry groups. ICBC slid to
3.94  yuan . Ping An Bank Co. lost 2.8 percent to 9.33 yuan.
Gemdale retreated to 6.65 yuan. New China Life Insurance Co.
sank 5.7 percent to 23.01 yuan.  Citic Securities Co. lost 2.2 percent to 9.97 yuan. Credit
Suisse analysts led by Frances Feng cut the brokerage’s 2013
earnings by 12 percent in a report and reduced their target
price for the Hong Kong-traded shares.  IPOs have been suspended since October as investor appetite
for new stock waned amid equity-market declines.  Overnight Rates  The Shanghai Composite has tumbled 18 percent from its
recent peak on Feb. 6 as data from industrial production to
exports pointed to a sustained slowdown in the economy. Stocks
also fell as overnight money-market rates rose to record highs.  The overnight rate dropped for a ninth day today, the
longest run of declines since March. The one-day repurchase
rate, which measures interbank funding availability, fell 24
basis points to 3.47 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. The rate
reached a record 13.91 percent on June 20.  The Shanghai index trades at 8.2 times 12-month projected
profit after falling to 7.99 on June 24, the cheapest level in
at least five years,  data  show.  Oil Surge  Gauges of industrial companies and material producers
dropped at least 1.1 percent. Sany Heavy dropped to 7.06 yuan.
Jiangxi Copper, the nation’s biggest producer of the metal,
declined 1.3 percent to 15.77 yuan.  Crude oil rallied above $100 a barrel for the first time in
nine months on political turmoil in  Egypt  and shrinking U.S.
stockpiles. West Texas Intermediate Crude climbed 1.4 percent to
$100.95 a barrel.  PetroChina Co., the state oil producer, rose 2.2 percent to
8.02 yuan, completing a five-day, 9.7 percent rally since
reaching a record low on June 26. The stock is still down 11
percent this year.  Leshi Internet Information & Technology Co. led gains on
the ChiNext of Shenzhen-listed companies. Leshi Internet, a
Beijing-based online video company, jumped 10 percent to 31.93
yuan, taking its gain this year to more than 200 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
