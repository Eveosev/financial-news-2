Palm oil  gained for the first time in
six days after West Texas Intermediate crude surged above $100 a
barrel for the first time since September, boosting demand for
vegetable oils as biofuel feedstock.  The contract for September delivery advanced 1.1 percent to
close at 2,365 ringgit ($741) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives. Futures yesterday closed at the lowest price for
the most active futures since May 21. Palm for local physical
delivery in July was at 2,360 ringgit, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Crude for delivery in August gained as much as 2.6 percent
to $102.18 a barrel in  New York  on shrinking U.S. stockpiles and
concern that political turmoil in Egypt may disrupt Middle
Eastern supply. A record 5.6 million tons of palm was used for
fuel in 2012, according to Oil World, a Hamburg-based research
company.  “Crude oil’s strength may encourage some biodiesel demand
to come in,” Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at LT
International Futures Sdn., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur .
“The Ramadan demand is still there,” he said, referring to the
Muslim fasting month.  Palm oil exports from Malaysia, the second-largest
producer, increased 7 percent to 1.35 million tons in June from
a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said on July 1. Consumption
typically increases during Ramadan, which starts this month, as
observers break day-long fasts with communal meals.  Soybean oil  for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to 45.88
cents a pound, while soybeans for delivery in November climbed
1.3 percent to $12.585 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery dropped 0.2 percent
to close at 5,888 yuan ($960) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , while soybean oil for delivery in the same month
declined 0.5 percent to end at 7,322  yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
