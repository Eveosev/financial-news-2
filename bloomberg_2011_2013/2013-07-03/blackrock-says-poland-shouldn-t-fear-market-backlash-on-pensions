Poland’s plan to overhaul its pension
system shouldn’t irk investors as it shows the government’s
commitment to reducing public debt,  BlackRock Inc (BLK)  said.  The review, which includes downsizing the mandatory
privately-owned pension funds in place since 1999, seeks to
remove a “gigantic burden” on public finances, Finance
Minister  Jacek Rostowski  said last week. A decision on the
revamp will be made at the end of August, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said yesterday. According to BlackRock’s Beata Harasim, a
London-based portfolio manager, the plans demonstrate “fiscal
prudence.”  “The government doesn’t need to be afraid it will be
punished,” Harasim, who helps manage debt at the world’s
largest money manager with $3.94 trillion in assets, said in a
phone interview with  Bloomberg News  late yesterday. “The most
likely variant assumes that debt levels will be reduced, making
policy more prudent.”  Poland is considering revising its 2013 budget as the
European Union’s largest eastern economy battles its worst
slowdown in over a decade and tax revenues fall short of plan.
With inflation at a seven-year low, Poland cut  interest rates  by
225 basis points since November to record low 2.50 percent
today.  Polish pension funds hold 280 billion zloty ($83.6 billion)
in assets, including 110.8 billion zloty in equities as of May
31, data from the financial markets regulator show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
