Lloyd’s of  London , the world’s oldest
insurance market, said Chief Executive Officer Richard Ward will
quit after eight years in the role.  Ward, 56, will step down at the end of December, the
London-based market said in a statement today. Lloyd’s said it
will start a process to identify his successor by the year-end.  “As Lloyd’s longest-serving CEO, I believe it is now right
to hand over the reins,” Ward said in the statement.  Lloyd’s, founded in a London coffee house in the 1680s,
swung into profit last year as costs linked to  Hurricane Sandy 
failed to exceed claims in 2011. Sandy, which struck the east
coast of the U.S. in October and was the third-most costly
natural disaster on record according to  Munich Re , cost Lloyd’s
about $2.2 billion, 10 percent of the industry’s total loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
