The West African Economic and
Monetary Union, an eight-member group striving to create a
system of regional lenders, capped its lending-rate ceiling for
commercial banks at 15 percent from next year.  The maximum lending rate for other financial-service
providers will be set at 24 percent from Jan. 1, according to a
statement the union e-mailed yesterday from the Senegalese
capital, Dakar.  Inflation in the zone slowed to 2 percent in May from 2.8
percent in December as prices of local cereals declined,
according to the statement.  Economic growth in the bloc that includes  Benin , Burkina
Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali,  Niger ,  Senegal , Togo and Guinea-Bissau
is forecast at 6.5 percent this year from 6.4 percent in 2012,
the Central Bank of West African States said last month. They
share a common currency known as the CFA franc, which is pegged
to the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
