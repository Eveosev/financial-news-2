Serbia stepped up tax collection in
June, bringing the monthly deficit to the lowest level this year
so far and keeping the six-month gap 12 percent below last
year’s shortfall.  The central government accumulated a deficit of 97.9
billion dinars ($1.1 billion) in six months through June, the
 Finance Ministry  said in an e-mail today. In June alone, the gap
stood at 4.3 billion dinars, compared with 17.7 billion dinars
in May. It didn’t publish a June consolidated deficit.  The June gap is “the best evidence that measures to
stabilize the state budget are giving first results” after the
deficit averaged “18.7 billion dinars per month in the first
five months,” the Belgrade-based ministry said, declaring
“zero tolerance to financial non-discipline.”  Revenue collection rose to 71 billion dinars in June, the
highest monthly reading in 2013, as the collection of excise
duties hit 23.8 billion dinars from 15.8 billion in May.  Serbia asked lawmakers to approve a revised 2013 budget,
which raises the deficit target to 4.7 percent of gross domestic
product, or 178.3 billion dinars, from an initially planned 122
billion dinars. The deficit stood at 6 percent of GDP in the
first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
