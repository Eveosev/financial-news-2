Flybe Group Plc (FLYB) ,  Europe ’s largest
independent regional airline, said Saad Hammad will become chief
executive officer and succeed Jim French, handing the former
 EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  executive the task of reviving profitability.  Hammad, who was chief commercial officer at Europe’s No. 2
discount carrier between October 2005 and April 2009, will take
over on August 1, the Exeter, England-based company said today.
Hammad, now managing director at the Gores Group, also served on
the board of Air Berlin for about a year until October 2012.  Flybe is cutting costs and trying to improve its balance
sheet amid reduced demand and high fuel prices. It sold takeoff
and landing slots at London’s Gatwick airport to EasyJet for 20
million pounds ($30 million) and is delaying an order for new
planes from Brazilian manufacturer  Embraer SA. (EMBR3)  The airline has
also renegotiated pay with pilots to improve its finances.
  “Flybe is making excellent progress on its turnaround plan,”
Hammad said in a statement. “The business is once again ’fit to
compete,’” he said, “with further opportunities to drive its
competitive advantages.”  Flybe’s adjusted pretax loss in the 12 months through March
tripled to 23.2 million pounds ($35.15 million) from a year
earlier, the company said. Full-year sales rose 15 percent to
782 million pounds. Flybe shares have retreated 8.8 percent this
year, valuing the airline at 34.9 million pounds.  French, who also holds also the chairman role, will become
non-executive chairman on August 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
