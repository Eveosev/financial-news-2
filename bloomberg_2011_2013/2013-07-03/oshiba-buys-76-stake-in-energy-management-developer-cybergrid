Toshiba Corp. (6502) , a Japanese maker of
flash-memory chips and nuclear reactors, acquired a 76 percent
stake in CyberGRID GmbH, an Austrian developer and provider of
energy management.  The purchase will enhance Toshiba’s smart community
business in  Europe , “where progress in introducing renewable
energy is driving a need for optimal power management technology
that delivers a stable power supply,” the company said in a
 statement  today. No financial terms were disclosed.  The move followed Toshiba’s acquisition of Swiss
electronic-metering company Landis+Gyr AG in 2011 and Consert
Inc., a U.S. energy management company in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
