Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc. (RH) 
reappointed Gary Friedman as chairman and co-chief executive
officer less than a year after he resigned following a board
inquiry into his personal relationship with an employee.  Friedman, who  had  a 6.7 percent stake in the home
furnishings retailer as of May 20, will continue his work
creating and marketing products, the Corte Madera, California-based company said today in a statement. Friedman, 55, will also
start a new luxury brand of apparel, accessories and jewelry
called RH Atelier.  The executive had served as creator and curator and
chairman emeritus since his resignation in September after the
disclosure of the relationship, which violated company rules.
Carlos Alberini, 57, who had been sole CEO after Friedman
stepped down, was also named co-CEO.  “Gary is a visionary with amazing talents who has led the
extraordinary transformation of RH into one of the leading
luxury brands in the market today,” Alberini said in the
statement. “On behalf of our leadership team, I am thrilled to
welcome Gary back into this role.”  Cammeron McLaughlin, a company spokeswoman, said Friedman
was unavailable for interview.  Restoration Hardware’s shares have more than tripled since
it  raised  $143 million in an initial public offering in
November. The stock gained 0.7 percent to $75.93 at the close in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
