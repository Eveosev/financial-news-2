Service industries  in the U.S.
unexpectedly expanded in June at the slowest pace in more than
three years, indicating widespread progress may elude the
world’s largest economy even as manufacturing improves.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing
index dropped to 52.2 last month, the lowest reading since
February 2010, from 53.7 in May, a report from the Tempe,
Arizona-based group showed today. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey called for a rise to 54. A reading greater than
50 indicates expansion in the industries that make up almost 90
percent of the economy.  Service providers placed orders at a slower pace even as
they hired more workers, which may indicate demand is strong
enough to prompt a pickup in economic growth later this year.
The slowdown indicates the effects of the payroll tax increase
and government budget cuts that took effect earlier this year
may still be lingering.  The service slowdown is probably “the tail of the
adjustment to fiscal drag,”  Ken Mayland , president of ClearView
Economics in  Pepper Pike ,  Ohio , said before the report. “At
some point you reach a new equilibrium, and that becomes a
springboard for expansion.”  Stocks held earlier losses after the report. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent to 1,609.68 at 10:44 a.m. in
 New York , and  oil prices  rose on concern over mounting political
unrest in  Egypt .  Survey Results  Estimates of the 74 economists in the Bloomberg survey
ranged from 52 to 55.6 for the services index, which includes
industries from utilities and retailers to health care, housing
and finance. The gauge averaged 53.6 since the expansion began
in June 2009 through May.  Other reports today showed companies boosted employment in
June, the trade gap unexpectedly surged in May and fewer workers
filed claims for  unemployment benefits  last week as  consumer
confidence  climbed to the highest level in more than five years.  The ISM’s factory index earlier this week showed
manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the
economy, expanded more than expected in May, climbing to a
three-month high of 50.9 from 49 in May. Employment lagged,
falling to 48.7 from 50.1 the prior month.  Orders Cool  The ISM non-manufacturing survey’s measure of new orders
decreased to 50.8 in June, the weakest reading since July 2009,
from 56 a month earlier. A gauge of business activity dropped to
51.7, the lowest since November 2009, from 56.5.  Employment was a bright spot, with the hiring gauge
climbing to 54.7, a four-month high, from 50.1 last month.  Consumer spending  rebounded in May after dropping in April
for the first time in almost a year, Commerce Department data
showed last week. Purchases gained 0.3 percent in May after
dropping 0.3 percent the prior month. Household purchases
account for about 70 percent of the economy.  The rebound in housing may help explain why consumer
confidence and spending are improving, benefiting companies such
as  Paychex Inc. (PAYX) , which provides human resource and payroll
outsourcing to small- and medium-sized businesses.  “I think housing is a really important measure for us
because we have a lot of jobs around that, a lot of contracting,
roofers, et cetera around that,” Martin Mucci, the Rochester,
New York-based company’s chief executive officer, said in a June
27 earnings call. Mucci said that housing starts and prices have
increased. “All of that is positive and so we’re feeling like
we’re coming off the end of the year with some momentum and that
will certainly help us.”  Home Prices  The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property values increased
12.05 percent from April 2012 after advancing 10.9 percent in
March.  Purchases of  previously owned  homes also climbed in May,
rising to a 5.18 million pace following a 4.97 million annual
rate in April, according to the National Association of
Realtors. Housing starts picked up to a 914,000 annual rate from
856,000 the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed.  Borrowing costs have climbed from record lows, which
potentially could slow the industry’s momentum. The  average rate 
on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.46 percent in the week ended
June 27, its highest since July 2011, according to data from
 Freddie Mac . The rate fell to 4.29 percent this week and reached
a record low of 3.31 percent in November in figures dating to
1972.  The  unemployment rate  was 7.6 percent in May and is
forecast to drop to 7.5 percent when the Labor Department
releases June figures July 5. Payroll data released that day
will show that 165,000 jobs were added in June following a
175,000 gain for May, based on the median estimate among
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
