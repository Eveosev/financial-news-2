Treasuries fell for the first time in
three days as traders speculated the June employment report may
be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to pull back on its
asset-buying program.  The Labor Department is forecast to say on July 5 the U.S.
added 165,000 jobs last month after a private report showed
companies increased payrolls. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
June 19 policy makers may slow the purchases this year and end
them in 2014 if economic growth meets policy makers’ goals.
Treasuries rose earlier as investors sought safety after two of
Portugal’s ministers resigned and Egyptian President Mohamed
Mursi defied protests demanding his resignation.  “Friday is the number that matters -- this is just a warm-up,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist in New York at
broker-dealer BTIG LLC. “People are so on edge that, if the
number is 215,000 or above, there’s upside risk to yields. Most
discussions are centered on overseas issues, particularly
Portugal.”  The  yield  on the 10-year yield rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 2.50 percent at 2 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It earlier fell to
2.41 percent, the least since June 21. The 1.75 percent note
maturing in May 2023 fell 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face value,
to 93 14/32.  The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
recommended an early close at 2 p.m. New York time before the
observance tomorrow of the July 4 holiday in the U.S.  Market ‘Repricing’  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, fell 13 percent to $240
billion from $249.75 billion yesterday. It closed at $445
billion on June 28. The 2013 average is $321.8 billion.  Treasury 10-year yields have dropped since rising to 2.66
percent on June 24, the highest level since August 2011.  Yields will be little changed at 2.42 percent by Dec. 31,
according to Bloomberg surveys of banks and securities companies
with the most recent predictions given the heaviest weightings.
The estimate has increased from this year’s low of 2.14 percent
in January.  The benchmark yields briefly erased a drop today after ADP
Research Institute said U.S. companies added 188,000 jobs in
June, compared with a forecast of 160,000 jobs in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  A separate report showed jobless claims decreased by 5,000
to 343,000 in the week ended June 29, from a revised 348,000 in
the prior period that was higher than initially reported, the
Labor Department said in  Washington .  ‘Very Strong’  The ADP “number is a very strong number and the market is
repricing closer back to the 2.50 percent level until we get to
nonfarm payrolls,” said Dan Mulholland, head of Treasury
trading at BNY Mellon Capital Markets in New York. “We expect
the market to stay within two basis points of 2.50 percent going
into Friday.”  Yields dropped after the Institute for Supply Management’s
non-manufacturing  index dropped  to 52.2 last month, the lowest
reading since February 2010, from 53.7 in May, a report from the
Tempe, Arizona-based group showed today. The median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey called for a rise to 54. A reading greater 50
indicates expansion in the industries that make up almost 90
percent of the economy.  The U.S.  unemployment  rate declined to a four-year low of
7.5 percent, from 7.6 percent, according to 81 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before the report later this week.  Deepening Recession  U.S. debt gained earlier as Portuguese Foreign Affairs
Minister Paulo Portas and finance chief Vitor Gaspar both quit,
threatening the stability of the ruling coalition and pushing up
the nation’s borrowing costs.  Portuguese Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling
rising joblessness and a deepening recession as he cuts spending
and raises taxes to meet terms of a 78 billion-euro ($101
billion) rescue plan monitored by the European Union, the
International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.  In  Egypt , Mursi defied calls for his resignation hours
before a military-imposed deadline. The army said July 1 it
would impose its own plan if Mursi didn’t end the turmoil and
meet the people’s demands within 48 hours.  “What we’re seeing now is political uncertainty once
again,” said Orlando Green, a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “That’s come
back on the agenda after the limelight shifted to the Fed in
recent weeks.”  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs, including $5.2 billion today in notes maturing
between April 2018 and March 2019.  The U.S. announced it will sell $32 billion in three-year
notes, $21 billion in 10-year debt and $13 billion in 30-year
notes on three consecutive days starting July 9.
