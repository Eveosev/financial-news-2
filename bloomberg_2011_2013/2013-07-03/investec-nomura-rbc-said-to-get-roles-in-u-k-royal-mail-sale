The U.K. Department of Business
appointed  Investec Plc (INVP) , Nomura Holdings Inc. and Royal Bank of Canada to junior roles in the sale of  Royal Mail  Group Ltd.,
according to a person familiar with the decision.  The department appointed  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners on
May 29, Barclays Plc as joint bookrunner and sponsor, and  Bank
of America (BAC)  Merrill Lynch as joint bookrunner for the deal. Total
fees if the deal goes ahead will be in the region of 10 million
pounds ($15 million) to 15 million pounds, said the person, who
declined to be identified because details are not yet public.  While no final decision has been taken about how or when to
sell the state-owned postal service, according to the
department, the government has said its preferred option is an
initial public offering by the end of the current financial year
next March.  The planned sale of Royal Mail will be the largest
privatization in Britain since former Prime Minister  John Major 
broke up the country’s railway in the 1990s. The 360-year-old company, one of the nation’s biggest employers with
about 159,000 staff, has sought to adapt its letter-focused
network to more lucrative package delivery in the face of
competition from TNT NV of the Netherlands and  Deutsche Post
AG (DPW) ’s DHL Express unit.  Royal Mail’s operating profit more than doubled in the year
to March 31 to 403 million pounds as growth in web-based
shopping spurred parcel deliveries. While sales gained 5 percent
to 9.28 billion pounds, parcel revenue rose 9 percent.  Royal Mail in May appointed Equiniti Group to manage the
distribution of 10 percent of its shares to employees following
any sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
