Chr. Hansen A/S (CHR) , the world’s biggest
maker of dairy enzymes, dropped the most since its 2010 initial
stock sale after cutting its full-year sales forecast on lower
prices for the red pigment carmine.  Sales will probably rise 6 percent to 7 percent on a like-for-like basis, down from an earlier targeted range of 7 percent
to 9 percent, the Hoersholm, Denmark-based company said in a
statement today. Third-quarter profit of 34.9 million euros ($45
million) fell short of the 37.8 million-euro average of eight
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of the maker of enzymes that create the holes in
emmental cheese fell as much as 7.8 percent, the steepest
intraday decline since the stock began trading in June 2010.
Lower carmine prices and weaker demand of probiotics for yogurt
in  North America  and  Europe  stifled growth.  Separately, Chief Executive Officer Cees de Jong said today
he’s reorganizing the company into three geographic regions to
improve sales to strengthen the focus on customers and “move
regional commercial decision-making and corporate leadership
closer.”  Chr. Hansen traded 4.5 percent lower at 191.70 kroner as of
10:06 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
