Turkish benchmark bonds fell and the
lira weakened to a record low on a closing basis after  inflation (TUCPIY) 
accelerated more than expected to the quickest in nine months.  Yields on two-year benchmark bonds climbed 22 basis points
to 7.56 percent at 10:28 a.m. in Istanbul. The lira weakened 1
percent to 1.9532 per dollar, a record low on a closing basis
and extending its loss this year to 8.6 percent.  Inflation in June accelerated to 8.30 percent in June from
6.51 percent in May, the state statistics office in Ankara said
on its website today. That exceeded all estimates in a Bloomberg
survey that predicted a reading of 7.60 percent, according to
the median estimate of 12 economists.  “The inflation figures are clearly negative for the  bond
market ,” Ibrahim Aksoy, an economist at Seker Invest in
Istanbul, wrote in an e-mailed note. “The figures increase the
possibility of a hike in the overnight lending rate, i.e. the
upper boundary of the interest rate corridor, until year-end,
should we see a further round of lira volatility.”  Three-month historical volatility in the lira climbed for a
fifth day to 8.38 percent, the highest since Aug. 13, according
to Bloomberg data.  The central bank reduced the minimum amount it may sell in
daily dollar auctions to $50 million from $150 million after the
lira touched its strongest in two weeks during early trade
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
