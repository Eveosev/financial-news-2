Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with a
benchmark index heading for a second day of decline, after the
city’s retail sales missed analysts’ estimates and China’s
services industry expanded at a slower pace.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slipped 1.4 percent to 20,379.48 as of
9:51 a.m. in Hong Kong, with all but three shares falling. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , which capped its worst start
to a year since 2008 last month, lost 2.3 percent to 8990.34.  The city’s benchmark gauge posted its biggest monthly
decline in a year last month as China’s money-market rates
surged to record and after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said policy makers may start dialing down stimulus if
the  U.S. economy  shows sustained improvement.  The gauge of mainland equities traded in Hong Kong, also
known as the H-share index, has fallen more than 20 percent from
its Feb. 1 high, meeting some investors’ definition of a bear
market. The measure traded at 6.8 times estimated earnings as of
yesterday, 28 percent below a three-year average of 9.42.  Shares on the benchmark  Hang Seng Index   traded  at 9.7 times
estimated earnings as of yesterday, compared with multiples of
14.6 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  retreated 0.1 percent after
the U.S. measure yesterday slid 0.1 percent. Data today from the
ADP Research Institute may indicate American companies increased
employment in June.  The Hang Seng Index futures dropped 1.4 percent to 20,349.
The HSI Volatility Index gained 5.4 percent to 22.52, indicating
traders expect a swing of 6.5 percent for the equity benchmark
in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
