Second-seeded  Andy Murray  has come
from behind to force a deciding fifth set against  Fernando
Verdasco  in their Wimbledon tennis quarterfinal.  Unseeded Verdasco won the first two sets 6-4, 6-3 on Centre
Court at the All England Club. Murray, the reigning U.S. Open
champion and runner-up to Switzerland’s Roger Federer at
Wimbledon last year, then took the next two 6-1, 6-4.  Murray is trying to become the first British man to win the
singles title at the grass-court championship since  Fred Perry 
in 1936. He’s ranked 52 places above Spain’s Verdasco by the ATP
Tour.  The winner plays Jerzy Janowicz in the semifinals in two
days. Janowicz, the 24th seed from Poland, defeated countryman
Lukasz Kubot 7-5, 6-4, 6-4.  Earlier, top-seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia and No. 8 Juan
Martin Del Potro of Argentina won in straight sets to set up the
other semifinal.  Djokovic, the 2011 champion, beat No. 7 Tomas Berdych of
the Czech Republic 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3, while Del Potro overcame
a knee injury in the first set to defeat fourth-seeded  David
Ferrer  of Spain 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
