The eThekwini municipality in the
coastal city of Durban may build the water-stressed nationâ€™s
first large-scale desalination plant, South African Press
Association said, citing the water affairs department.  A feasibility study for the seawater desalination plant has
been completed by state-owned Umgeni Water, the  news agency 
said, citing Trevor Balzer, director-general for the department.
Balzer said  Cape Town  was also looking at large-scale
desalination to supplement its water supply.  The KwaZulu-Natal coastal metropolitan area already exceeds
the available water supply by 65 million cubic meters a year,
the news agency reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
