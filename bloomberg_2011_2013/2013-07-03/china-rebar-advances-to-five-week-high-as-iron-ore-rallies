Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose to the highest level in five weeks as  iron ore 
prices rallied for a fourth day.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained as much as 0.5 percent to 3,580 yuan ($584) a
metric ton, the highest price since May 24. The contract traded
at 3,568 yuan at 10:33 a.m. local time. Futures climbed 3.5
percent last month, the first monthly gain since January.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in  China 
gained 2.1 percent to $119.30 a dry ton yesterday, the highest
level since June 20, according to The Steel Index Ltd. The raw
material is a key ingredient for steel production.  “Higher iron ore prices will lead to gains in production
cost,” Dang Man, an analyst at Maike Futures Co., said by phone
from Xi’an today. “That will lend some support to the rebar
market in the short term.”  The average spot price for rebar in China was little
changed at 3,358  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
