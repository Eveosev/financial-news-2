Calbee (2229)  Inc., a Japanese maker of
potato chips, fell as much as 17 percent today, prompting the
company to investigate the cause amid speculation the trade was
made in error.  The shares lost 17 percent to 8,350 yen at 9:06 a.m. in
 Tokyo , its biggest drop on record, with 10,200 shares  changing
hands  at that time. The shares were untraded afterwards as bids
outnumbered offers by about 18-to-1 as of 9:24 a.m. Shares later
pared declines to 1.2 percent, trading at 10,000 yen as of 10:23
a.m.  Calbee is unaware of the cause of the decline in its shares
and is making inquiries with brokerages, the company’s equity
department manager Hirofumi Noine said today. The brokerages
suggested to Calbee that the share drop looks like a trading
error, Noine said.  The Tokyo Stock Exchange hasn’t been given notice and the
bourse is unaware if the trade was an error, exchange spokesman
Ryo Takahashi said.  “While we don’t know for sure, looking at the move in its
shares, there’s a high chance it was a trading error,” said
said  Mitsuo Shimizu , a Tokyo-based analyst at  Iwai Cosmo
Holdings Inc. (8707)  “There was a sudden sell order, and after shares
fell to their lower limit there were immediate buy orders. If it
was a normal trade, shares would fall and activity would slow
down.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
