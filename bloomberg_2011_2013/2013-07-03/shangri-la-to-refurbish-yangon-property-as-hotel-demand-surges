Shangri-La Asia Ltd. (69) , the hospitality
group owned by billionaire  Robert Kuok , said it plans to
refurbish its Traders Hotel in Myanmar, where  United Nations 
offices occupy five floors.  The hotel informed the UN of its plans to renovate the
Yangon property in early 2012 and also extended the lease at the
end of August 2012 by another year as the “utmost assistance”
in helping the agency move its offices, according to Greg Dogan,
president and chief executive officer of Shangri-La
International Hotel Management Ltd.  “Traders Hotel, Yangon and the United Nations have been
long-term business partners, and both parties continue to enjoy
an amicable and professional working relationship,” Dogan, who
heads the group’s hotel management unit, said in an e-mailed
response to queries.  More tourists are visiting Myanmar after President  Thein Sein  allowed more political freedom since coming to power two
years ago, leading to the easing of sanctions by countries
including the U.S. The Hong Kong-based company will open its
Shangri-La Residence serviced apartments in Yangon later this
year, as well as a Shangri-La-branded hotel in the city in 2017,
according to its  website .  Traders Hotel in Yangon will undergo a refurbishment after
more than 16 years, Dogan said.  The UN, which leased five floors of the property since 2007,
said it’s moving out next month because the city’s hotel rates
are surging and rising demand from tourists “makes it more
profitable for the hotel to get back to its initial purpose” of
catering to travelers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
