South Africa ’s rand weakened for a
third day as growth in  China ’s service industries slowed and a
slump in Portuguese bonds reignited concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
is worsening. Bonds fell, snapping a six-day rally.  China’s non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index
declined to 53.9 in June, adding to evidence of slowing growth
in the economy of the biggest buyer of South African raw
materials. The resignation of two ministers from  Portugal ’s
government sent the nation’s yields to the highest level this
year, damping investor appetite for riskier assets.  “When you get bad news out of China, like we did this
morning, the rand is going to suffer,” Ion de Vleeschauwer, the
Johannesburg-based chief dealer at Bidvest Bank, said by phone.
“It’s a volatile market and the rand is a high-beta currency,”
he added, referring to its relatively high price swings.  The South African currency depreciated 1 percent to 10.0941
per dollar as of 11:01 a.m. in Johannesburg, the worst
performance out of 24 emerging-market currencies monitored by
Bloomberg. Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December
2026 rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.92
percent.  The rand’s one-month implied volatility versus the dollar
climbed 42 basis points today to 17.50, indicating that options
traders see wider price swings in coming weeks. The rand’s
implied volatility is the second-highest after Argentina’s peso
among 23 emerging-market currencies monitored by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
