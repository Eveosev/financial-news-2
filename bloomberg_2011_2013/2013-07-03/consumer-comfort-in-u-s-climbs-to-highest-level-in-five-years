Consumer sentiment climbed last week
to its highest level in more than five years as Americans became
increasingly convinced the time was right to spend.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose to minus 27.5 in
the period ended June 30, its highest level since January 2008,
from minus 28.3 a week earlier. Measures of personal finances
and buying climate gained.  Higher  home values  and improvements in the labor market are
helping boost demand for housing and  automobiles  as consumers
gain confidence the expansion will continue. The figures
indicated households are looking past a recent jump in borrowing
costs as the economy recovers and fuel costs retreat.  “Declining gasoline prices and the boost from modest
income gains appear to be offsetting for the current time
volatility in equity markets,” said  Joseph Brusuelas , a senior
economist at Bloomberg LP in New York. “The key to sustained
improvement going forward will be an acceleration in hiring and
easing of energy prices, which bolster household discretionary
spending despite restrained wage growth.”  Other reports today showed companies boosted employment in
June, fewer workers filed claims for unemployment benefits last
week and the trade gap unexpectedly surged in May.  Payrolls at U.S. companies climbed by 188,000 workers in
June, exceeding the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey,
following a 134,000 gain the prior month, figures from the
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed.
 Jobless claims  decreased by 5,000 to 343,000 in the week ended
June 29, the Labor Department said.  Trade Gap  The  gap  between exports and imports widened to $45 billion
in May, the biggest since November, according to figures from
Commerce Department. The 12.1 percent increase in the deficit
from April was the biggest one-month gain in two years.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (COMFCOMF)  fell 0.4 percent to
1,607.97 at 9:40 a.m. in New York, and oil prices climbed, amid
mounting political unrest in  Egypt .  The Bloomberg index has foreshadowed changes in other
measures. The Conference Board’s  gauge  in June rose to its
highest level since January 2008, exceeding all forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey, a report showed last week.  Higher-income Americans are seeing the biggest improvement
in confidence. The index for households earning from $75,000 to
$100,000 jumped to 14.8, its highest since November 2007, from
9.6 the week prior. The outlook improved for households earning
more than $100,000 a year, rising to 18.9, the third-highest
level since November 2007, from 14.8.  Buying Climate  The advance in the consumer index was driven by a more
optimistic view on shopping, with the buying climate index
rising to minus 34.9 from minus 37.4 a week earlier as more
households said the time was right to purchase things.  A gauge on American’s views on personal finances also
improved to 4.4 after holding at 3.8 for two weeks. The measure
of how Americans view the current state of the economy declined
for a second week to minus 51.9 from minus 51.3. A reading three
weeks ago of minus 51.2 was the highest since January 2008.  The housing market is probably accounting for some of the
improved optimism. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values
in 20 cities increased 12.1 percent in April from the same month
in 2012, the biggest year-over-year gain since March 2006, a
report last week showed.  Purchases (NHSLTOT)  of new homes jumped in May to
five-year high, figures from the Commerce Department also showed
last week.  The confidence index was minus 21.3 among homeowners, its
second-highest since January 2008, from minus 24 a week prior.
The outlook among renters declined for the first time in seven
weeks to minus 38.2 from minus 36.5, which was the highest since
March 2008.  Auto Sales  Automotive companies such as General Motors Co. and  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  have benefited as residential property values and
stock prices spur demand. Ford sales of cars and light trucks
gained 13 percent in June, and GM’s rose 6.5 percent, both
exceeding analysts’ estimates, data showed yesterday. Industry
wide, purchases climbed to a 15.9 million annualized rate, the
most since November 2007, according to Ward’s Automotive Group.  Replacement demand and “historically low interest rates
irrespective of the conversations surrounding the Fed” are
fueling continued growth for the auto industry,  Ken Czubay ,
Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford’s vice president of U.S.
marketing, sales and service, said on a conference call
yesterday. “The tailwinds continue to be strong” and are
“pretty forceful,” he said.  Full-time workers were the least pessimistic since
November 2007, with their comfort index rising to minus 8.7 from
minus 9.7, today’s report showed.  Gains Bipartisan  Today’s report indicates confidence is growing on both
sides of the political spectrum. Republicans last week were the
least pessimistic since November 2008 when  Barack Obama  was
first elected president. Sentiment among registered Democrats
hovered near a 12-year high.  “The bipartisan nature of improving  consumer confidence 
raises the odds that the rally, now 12 weeks old, may have
staying power,” Gary Langer, president of Langer Research
Associates LLC in New York, which produces the comfort data for
Bloomberg, said in a press release.  The survey does point to some socioeconomic disparity in
the recovery. The gap between men and women is its largest since
January 2012 and between married and single adults, its largest
since May 2012. The gap between full-time and part-time workers
was its largest since December 2011 in the week prior. The
outlook for part-time employees increased for a second straight
week to minus 40.8 from minus 42.7.  Survey Details  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index conducts telephone
surveys with a random sample of 1,000 consumers 18 and older.
Each week, 250 respondents are asked for their views on the
economy, personal finances and buying climate. The percentage of
negative responses is subtracted from the share of positive
views and divided by three. The most recent reading is based on
the average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative. The
margin of error for the headline reading is 3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
