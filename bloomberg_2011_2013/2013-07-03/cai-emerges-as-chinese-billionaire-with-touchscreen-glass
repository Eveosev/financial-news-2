Shenzhen O-film Tech Co. Chairman Cai Rongjun has become a billionaire after shares in the Chinese touchscreen glass-panel maker  soared  almost 178 percent this year on higher demand for tablet computers.  Cai, 41, has a net worth of $1 billion after the stock advanced 10 percent yesterday, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index . He hasn’t appeared on any international wealth rankings. The bulk of his fortune consists of a 22 percent stake in the company, which  supplies screens  to  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , Samsung Electronics Co. and Sony Corp.  Tablets have emerged as a primary avenue to tap the Internet following Apple’s iPad debut in April 2010. Samsung, Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. followed with their own devices and helped propel a 78 percent increase in shipments to 128 million units in 2012, according to Bloomberg Industries analysts George Mykytyn and Anand Srinivasan. Tablets now represent a third of all personal computers made, they said.  “Demand for large touchscreen displays is exploding, resulting in a huge gap between supply and demand,” Wei Xingyun, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities wrote in a note to clients on March 12. He  rates  Shenzhen O-film stock “overweight.” “The company’s capacity expansion is set to boost full-year profit.”  Net income climbed to $52 million in 2012 from $3.4 million in 2011 as Cai expanded manufacturing while accumulating orders. Sales from touch screens for tablets and smartphones  accounted  for  90 percent  of 2012 revenue of $638.6 million, up 216 percent from 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lenovo Large  Lenovo, its biggest customer, reported a 90 percent gain in  fourth-quarter profit  on May 23 after increasing its market share and boosting smartphone sales. Lenovo introduced touchscreen handsets in Russia, India,  Indonesia ,  Vietnam  and the  Philippines  last year following the debut of its first model in China in 2010. It plans to enter Africa next.  Cai graduated from Shantou University in  Guangdong province , a school funded by Asia’s richest man  Li Ka-Shing . He worked for  Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ)  as a technician, engineer and manager between 1995 and 2001. In 2004, Cai and Hong Kong-based Yugao China Co., owned by his brother Cai Gaoxiao, acquired the predecessor of O-Film, according to a prospectus.  Shenzhen O-Film spokeswoman Cheng Xiaoli confirmed Cai’s shareholdings and declined to comment on his net worth calculation.
