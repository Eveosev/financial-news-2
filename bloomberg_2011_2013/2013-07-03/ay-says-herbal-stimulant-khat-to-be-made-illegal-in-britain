U.K. Home Secretary Theresa May
announced that khat, a flowering plant that when taken gives
users mild euphoria, will be categorized as a Class C drug,
meaning the penalty for possession can be up to two years in
jail.  Khat can lead to “health and social harms” such as “low
attainment and family breakdown,” May said in a written
statement to Parliament in  London  today. With the majority of
European Union states and most Group of Eight nations already
controlling the drug, the U.K. risks becoming a “single,
regional hub for the illegal onward trafficking of khat to these
countries,” she said.  A conviction for dealing a Class C drug carries a penalty
of as much as 14 years in jail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
