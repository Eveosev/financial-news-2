Liquefied natural gas prices for
shipment to Northeast Asia rose this week on lower supplies in
the Pacific, according to Energy Intelligence Group.  Spot cargoes for delivery of the power-station fuel over
the next four to eight weeks climbed to $15.40 per million
British thermal units from $15.15 in the period ended June 24,
the research company said on the website of its World Gas
Intelligence publication. The price in Southwest Europe
increased to $11.65 from last week’s $11.60, according to WGI.  LNG will gain this week as warmer summer weather in North
Asia boosts demand for electricity to run air conditioners,
according to four traders surveyed by Bloomberg News through
June 28. Asian buyers typically pay more from June to August as
power consumption climbs.  Nigeria LNG Ltd.,  Africa ’s biggest LNG exporter, declared
force majeure on exports June 28 after a week-long shipping
blockade by the nation’s maritime agency on its Bonny Island
loading bay. Force majeure is a contract clause that companies
may invoke when they miss shipments because of circumstances
beyond their control.  Supplies will probably increase as  GDF Suez (GSZ)  and Sonatrach
Group are selling one cargo each while  Australia ’s North West
Shelf LNG may put up some shipments for sale, according to the
research company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
