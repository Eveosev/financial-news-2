Canada extended the longest streak of
 merchandise trade  deficits in a quarter century in May, with the
shortfall narrowing as imports fell faster than exports.  The C$303 million ($287 million) deficit was the 17th in a
row and followed an April gap that was revised to C$951 million
from C$567 million, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the May deficit would
be C$700 million, based on the median of 19 forecasts.  Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said in a June 19
speech that rebuilding business confidence and investment will
require “patience” with shipments abroad weighed down by a
lack of global demand. The central bank has called the export
recovery the slowest since World War II, hampered by a strong
currency and a lack of competitiveness among Canadian companies.  “There aren’t a whole lot of positives in this report,”
said  Benjamin Reitzes , a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets
in Toronto. “June is probably going to be weak” because of
flooding in  Alberta  and a Quebec construction strike, he said.  Imports fell 3.2 percent to C$39.6 billion in May, the
first decline in five months. Shipments of crude oil and bitumen
fell 34.1 percent to C$1.5 billion, the lowest since March 2009,
while metal ores and minerals dropped 38.8 percent to C$777
million.  Exports fell 1.6 percent to C$39.3 billion in May, the
fastest since July 2012, following April’s 0.4 percent decline.
Metal ores and minerals fell 15.0 percent to C$4.2 billion and
motor vehicles and parts declined 3.8 percent to C$5.4 billion.  Volumes Decline  The volume of imports declined 2.0 percent and import
volumes fell 0.7 percent,  Statistics Canada  said. Volume figures
adjust for price changes and can be a better indicator of how
trade contributes to economic growth.  The  surplus with the U.S.  widened to C$3.45 billion in May
from C$3.41 billion a month earlier. Exports make up about one-third of Canada’s economy, with about 75 percent of  the
shipments  going to the U.S.  The U.S. Commerce Department reported today that the
American trade deficit widened by 12.1 percent to $45 billion as
imports climbed to the second-highest level on record.  Canada will record deficits in the broader trade measure
known as the current account through 2015 according to a
Bloomberg economist survey taken last month. The current account
covers trade in services as well as goods.  The Canadian dollar fell 0.2 percent to C$1.0564 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:23 a.m. in Toronto. One dollar buys 94.66 U.S.
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
