French 2012 farm income rose 9.4
percent to a record as earnings from growing grains jumped 20
percent and profit from livestock and wine grapes declined, the
Agriculture Ministry said.  Average pretax operating income climbed to 38,300 euros
($49,817) per farmer from 35,000 euros in 2011, the ministry’s
statistical department Agreste said in an online  report  today.  France is the European Union’s largest farm producer, and
the 28-nation bloc’s largest grower of wheat, barley and corn.
Prices for grain growers rose an average 20 percent last year
from 2011, according to the ministry.  “The surge in grain and oilseed prices boosts income in
the commodity crop regions but weighs on that in the regions of
herbivorous livestock production,” the ministry wrote. “The
wine regions pay the price of bad weather.”  Pretax income for growers of grains, oilseeds and protein
crops such as peas jumped to an average 72,800 euros from 49,300
euros in 2011 and 43,700 euros in 2010. For all commodity crops,
including sugar beets, average income surged to 76,500 euros
from 53,100 euros.  Vineyard income fell to an average 32,800 euros last year
from 47,200 euros a year earlier after  France ’s 2012 wine-grape
harvest fell to the lowest in more than 40 years.  Dairy farmer pretax earnings fell to 24,700 euros from
29,900 euros on the rising cost of animal feed and falling milk
production, while income for beef-cattle producers fell to
17,100 euros from 17,200 euros, the report showed.  Pig-farmer income rose to an average 52,900 euros last year
from 35,500 euros, while poultry breeders’ earnings rose to an
average 37,400 euros from 30,300 euros, Agreste reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
