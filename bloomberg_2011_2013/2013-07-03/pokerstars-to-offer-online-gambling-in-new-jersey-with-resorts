PokerStars , the world’s largest
Internet poker site, plans to offer online gaming in  New Jersey 
with Resorts Casino Hotel.  New Jersey legalized online betting in February as a way to
boost the state’s $3 billion casino industry, which has been
losing business as nearby markets expanded. Online operators are
required to form a partnership with a casino located in  Atlantic
City , the state’s gambling center.  A deal for PokerStars to buy New Jersey’s Atlantic Club
Casino Hotel fell apart earlier this year amid opposition from
the American Gaming Association trade group. PokerStars’ parent
company, Isle of Man-based  Rational Group Ltd. , reached a
settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over charges of
fraud and money laundering related to the company’s offering of
online poker in the country last year.  PokerStars and Resorts said today in a statement that their
agreement is pending approval by New Jersey regulators.  Resorts, Atlantic City’s first casino, opened in 1978 and
is owned by  New York  real estate investor Morris Bailey and
managed by a unit of the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
