Japan ’s  Topix index  rose for a fifth
day, capping the longest win streak since April after swinging
most of the day, as tiremakers climbed after the yen weakened.
Gains were limited as utilities led declines.  A  Topix (TPX)  group tracking rubber manufacturers jumped 4.5
percent as the yen fell beyond 100 per dollar for the first time
in a month.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  plunged 10 percent after
surging 19 percent yesterday. Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd.,
 Asia ’s largest initial public offering this year, traded 1.5
percent higher on its market debut.  The Topix rose 0.2 percent to 1,173.81 at the close in
 Tokyo  after falling 0.5 percent. Volume was 26 percent below the
30-day average as investors awaited monthly U.S. jobs figures
for signs the  Federal Reserve  may taper stimulus. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average lost 0.3 percent to 14,055.56.  “The yen beyond 100 per dollar is a plus for the stock
market,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees about
$111 billion. “There’s strong demand for profit-taking since
the market has risen a lot since last week.”  The Topix advanced 9.8 percent over the past five days,
paring its losses from an almost five-year high on May 22 to 8
percent. The gauge is up 37 percent this year amid optimism
Japan may beat deflation and achieve sustainable growth.  Yen Falls  The yen touched 100.86 per dollar today, the weakest since
May 31. A falling yen boosts the value of overseas earnings at
Japanese companies when repatriated. Companies in the Bank of
Japan’s Tankan survey on July 1 forecast the yen to average
91.20 per dollar in the year ending March 2014, compared with a
projection of 85.22 in the previous report.  Bridgestone Corp., the world’s biggest tiremaker, added 5.4
percent to 3,690 yen, leading gains on the  Nikkei 225 . Sumitomo
Rubber Industries, Ltd., Japan’s No. 2 by market value, rose 2.9
percent to 1,731 yen.  The Topix has swung an average of about 2.9 percent daily
since May 22. The measure’s 30-day  historic volatility  closed at
37.68 today after yesterday rising to its highest since the 2011
earthquake. The gauge traded at 14.8 times average estimated
earnings, compared with 14.6 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  dropped 0.5 percent. The index fell
less than 0.1 percent yesterday ahead of monthly jobs figures
due July 5 and the start of earnings season. The U.S. probably
added 165,000 jobs in June, according to a Bloomberg survey. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said record stimulus could be cut if
the economy meets projections.  Tepco Slumps  Among stocks that fell, Tokyo Electric, known as Tepco,
slumped 10 percent to 559 yen, falling the most in the 1,711-member Topix. The utility surged yesterday after public
broadcaster NHK said it will apply to restart reactors, which
the company later confirmed.  Suntory Beverage & Food, a unit of Osaka-based Suntory
Holdings Ltd., gained 1.5 percent to 3,145 yen after raising
almost $4 billion in the initial public offering. The seller of
Orangina soda and Boss coffee last week priced its shares near
the low end of a projected range after volatile markets curbed
demand. The company aims to double sales to 2 trillion yen by
2020 as it expands overseas.  Calbee Inc. (2229) , a maker of potato chips, slid 1.6 percent to
9,960 yen after plunging as much as 17 percent in early trading,
stoking speculation about a possible trading error.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. added 0.8 percent to
644 yen after swinging between gains and losses. The country’s
biggest lender said it plans to buy  Thailand ’s Bank of Ayudhya
Pcl. The 560 billion yen ($5.6 billion) purchase would be the
largest takeover in Asia by a Japanese bank, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
