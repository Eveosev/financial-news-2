 Don Mattrick, the game-industry veteran who was hired as chief executive officer of  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  this week, is receiving compensation totaling more than $50 million to turn around the struggling social-game developer.  He will receive a $5 million signing bonus, $1 million salary, $25 million in restricted stock vesting over three years, and additional restricted shares and options valued at $15 million, the San Francisco-based company said in a filing yesterday. In 2014, Mattrick is eligible for a bonus of as much as $5 million and a performance-based equity grant valued at $7 million.  Mattrick faces the challenge of turning around Zynga, which is suffering amid rising competition from upstarts such as King.com as well as a shift toward gaming on handheld devices. He’s taking over the CEO role from  Mark Pincus , Zynga’s founder, who will remain chairman of the board and chief product officer.  Zynga also said that Owen Van Natta has resigned as a director. He had served as executive vice president and chief business officer from August 2010, until November 2011, when he resigned from those duties.  Pincus lowered his 2013 salary to $1 in April. His base pay was $300,000 in each of the two previous years, though his total compensation in 2011 reached $1.68 million after accounting for a $3,750 bonus and $1.37 million in life insurance premiums.  Zynga lured Mattrick from  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , where he was president of the interactive-entertainment business, leading the effort to introduce the next-generation Xbox One home-entertainment and gaming console.
