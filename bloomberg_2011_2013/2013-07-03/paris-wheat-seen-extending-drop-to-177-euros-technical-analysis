Paris wheat futures for November
delivery may extend declines to about 177 euros ($230) a metric
ton in September, according to technical analysis by Matthias
Damge, a broker at Agricote Courtage in Bourges,  France .  The level implies an 8.4 percent drop from yesterday’s
close of 193.25 euros. The attached chart shows the 177 price
would be near a 23.6 percent extension of the retracement from
the May 10, 2012 low of 191.50 euros to the Nov. 9 peak of
249.75 euros, one of the levels singled out in so-called
Fibonacci analysis.  “We still have room to fall, we could have an extension of
the decline,” Damge said by phone yesterday. “We can trace a
tunnel since the start of March. If we break through 191 we can
fall toward 175, after the harvest in September.”  Wheat prices have slumped this year as harvests of the
grain in Russia and Ukraine are expected to climb, adding to
supplies, and as U.S. farmers are forecast to reap a record corn
crop after planting the most since 1936.  “It’s even more bearish on fundamentals than on a chart
basis,” Damge said. The broker said milling wheat for November
delivery is near oversold status based on the relative strength
index and may rebound in the short term to 205 euros a ton
“without breaking the downward trend.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or rise by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
