Structured-note sales fell during the
first half of the year in the U.S. and  Europe , as lower stock
volatility and  interest rates  left issuers struggling to offer
attractive terms.  U.S. issuance dropped to $20.2 billion during the period, 6
percent less than last year and the least for the first six
months since the start of 2010, when Bloomberg began collecting
comprehensive data on the securities. European banks sold $41.7
billion of the securities, the slowest start in 10 years,
Bloomberg data show.  Investors bought fewer securities in the U.S. because
features that clients “embrace,” such as protection against
losses, weren’t as favorable as in the past, said Tom Balcom,
founder of  1650 Wealth Management , a Lauderdale-by-the-Sea,
Florida, investment adviser.  “The two key components for structured notes are
volatility and interest rates,” he said in a telephone
interview. Higher levels of both allow issuers to sweeten
product terms, such as for the size of coupons or the amount of
leverage on gains.  Stock volatility during the first half, as measured by the
 Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) , averaged 14.23,
the lowest since 2007. Europe’s VStoxx Index, a gauge of Euro
Stoxx 50 Index option prices, averaged 19.14 this year through
June 30, down from 27.31 during the same period in 2012.  Treasury Rates  Rates and volatility increased after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on June 19 that the central bank
may slow its $85 billion a month in securities purchases by the
end of the year. Ten-year Treasuries yielded an average of 1.88
percent this year through the end of May, then the rate surged
to 2.61 percent on June 25, the highest in almost two years.  Banks sold $2.8 billion of U.S. structured notes last
month, a 22 percent drop from May, and the slowest such period
since December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Outside the U.S., excluding notes where the amount of
principal returned can vary, issuance totaled $5.28 billion, 29
percent less than the $7.39 billion sold in May.  While sales of U.S. notes linked to rates declined 5.9
percent from the same period last year, securities tied to
equities have climbed 7 percent, to $14.3 billion.  Biggest Offering  Bank of America Corp . issued $284.5 million of five-year
notes tied to the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) , the biggest
offering since Sept. 14, 2012. The securities, issued June 27,
yield 1.22 times the gains of the benchmark with protection
against 30 percent of losses, according to a prospectus filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank
estimated the note’s value at 4.4 percent less than what
investors paid.  The Dow Jones index of the 30 largest U.S. companies rose
13.9 percent this year to 14,932.41 as of the close of trading
yesterday.  Matt Card, a spokesman for the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank, declined to comment on the note sale.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
