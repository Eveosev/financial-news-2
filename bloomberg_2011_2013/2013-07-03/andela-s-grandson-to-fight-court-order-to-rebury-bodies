Nelson Mandela’s grandson will ask a
South African court to overturn an order to exhume the bodies of
three of the former president’s children and rebury them in
Mandela’s home village, his attorney said.  Mandla Mandela will ask the Eastern Cape High Court in
Mthatha to hear arguments in the matter, Gary Jansen, his
lawyer, said in an interview on Johannesburg-based broadcaster
eNCA. Earlier today, the court ordered he return the remains to
Qunu, in Eastern Cape province, by this afternoon, Jansen said.  The court application was made by family members, including
Mandela’s daughter Makaziwe, after Mandla had the bodies moved
to Mvezo village, where he is the tribal chief, two years ago,
Johannesburg-based City Press reported on June 30.  “He has a right to state his case before the court,”
Jansen said. “He has asked the court to rescind the judgment.”  The family spat comes as 94-year-old Mandela, South
Africa’s first black president, remains critically ill in a
Pretoria hospital. He was admitted to the intensive-care unit on
June 8 to treat a recurring lung infection. President Jacob Zuma
said on July 1 that Mandela’s condition is still critical,
though stable.  Mandela spent 27 years in jail for opposing white minority
rule under apartheid, most of that time on Robben Island, where
he contracted tuberculosis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
