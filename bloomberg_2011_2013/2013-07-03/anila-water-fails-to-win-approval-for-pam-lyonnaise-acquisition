Manila Water Co. (MWC) , the utility serving
half the Philippine capital, failed to win approval for its
proposed purchase of a 51 percent stake in PT PAM Lyonnaise
Jaya, setting back plans for growth in Indonesia.  PAM Jaya, a state-owned company, rejected the plan,  Manila
Water  said in a statement, having previously agreed to buy stock
held by  France ’s Suez Environnement. PAM Lyonnaise supplies
water to western Jakarta under a 25-year accord with PAM Jaya.  The collapse of the deal, agreed to in October, means
Manila Water will have to look elsewhere for expansion in
Indonesia, south of the  Philippines . While the utility didn’t
specify why the planned purchase failed to win approval, the
 Jakarta Post  said last month that Jakarta City was seeking to
acquire a majority stake in PAM Lyonnaise.  “The deal could have potentially contributed 20 percent to
30 percent of Manila Water’s revenue,” said Kervin Sisayan, an
analyst at  COL Financial Group Inc. (COL)  in Manila. “It doesn’t
change how we view Manila Water’s fair value, especially since
we don’t know how much it was going to pay for the stake.”  PAM Lyonnaise, which has served western Jakarta since 1997
under its agreement with PAM Jaya, supplies 700 million liters
(185 million gallons) of water a day through 5,300 kilometers
(3,300 miles) of pipes, according to Manila Water.  Manila Water shares fell 0.5 percent to 31.85 pesos today,
trimming gains over the past year to 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
