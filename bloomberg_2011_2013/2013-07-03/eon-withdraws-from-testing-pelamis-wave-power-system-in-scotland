EON SE,  Germany ’s largest utility,
will stop working with Pelamis Wave Power Ltd. on a project to
test one of the U.K. company’s marine generators in  Scotland .  EON will withdraw from the project off Orkney because of
slow development of the technology, it said today in an e-mailed
statement. Pelamis said it won’t affect the company’s plans.  The utility will “monitor” marine-energy technology to be
ready when operations are more mature, it said in the statement.  Wave and tidal power developers haven’t yet begun operating
commercial-scale projects. Siemens AG, Alstom SA and DCNS SA
have taken stakes to gain a foothold as developers move toward
bringing systems to market. Pelamis said in October it’s in
talks on a partnership to help it commercialize its device.  Pelamis will keep operating the machine, and a second it’s
testing in Orkney for Iberdrola SA’s ScottishPower Renewables
Ltd. It’s working with Vattenfall AB on a 10-megawatt project
off the Shetland Islands. Pelamis expects to deliver commercial
machines in a few years, it said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
