Gold futures rose as  Europe ’s debt
crisis and escalating tensions in  Egypt  spurred demand for the
precious metal as a haven. Silver also advanced.  Two Portuguese ministers resigned in a dispute with Prime
Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  over handling of government debt,
and borrowing costs rose in Spain and  Italy . Egyptian President
Mohamed Mursi sought to retain power with a call for an interim
coalition government just before the expiration of a military
deadline that could drive him from office. Gold futures dropped
23 percent last quarter, the most since at least 1975.  “Europe’s debt struggle is back in the forefront, and that
is bringing some people to gold as a safety net,” Carlos Perez-Santalla, a New York-based broker at Marex North America LLC,
said in an e-mailed report. “Some speculators are moving to
gold because of the situation in Egypt.”  Gold futures for August delivery gained 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,251.90 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Prices touched $1,179.40 on June 28, the lowest since Aug.
2, 2010. U.S. markets will be closed tomorrow for the
Independence Day holiday.  Bullion has slipped 25 percent this year, wiping about
$59.5 billion from the value of gold-backed  exchange-traded
product holdings , as some investors lost faith in it as a store
of value and amid concern that the  Federal Reserve  may slow its
asset purchases this year.  Purchases of physical gold continue to increase, and some
investors are seeing lower prices as “an opportunity to jump
in,” Scott Carter, the chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Lear Capital, said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  Silver futures for September delivery climbed 2 percent to
$19.70 an ounce in New York. The metal is down 35 percent this
year, the most among the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, after touching $18.17 on June 28, the
lowest since August 2010.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery declined 1.5 percent to $1,346.80 an ounce, the
biggest drop since June 26. Palladium futures for September
delivery fell 0.5 percent to $685.70 an ounce, ending a four-session rally.  To contact the reporters on this story:
