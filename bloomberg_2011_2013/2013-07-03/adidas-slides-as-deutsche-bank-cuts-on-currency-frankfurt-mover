Adidas AG (ADS)  fell the most in more than
four months in Frankfurt trading after Deutsche Bank AG cut its
 recommendation  and said the sporting-goods maker may struggle to
meet its 2015 sales goal because of the euro’s strength.  Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to hold from buy,
sending the shares down as much as 4.4 percent. The decline was
the steepest since Feb. 26.  “Almost all currencies have developed to the disadvantage
of Adidas lately,” Frankfurt-based analyst Michael Kuhn wrote
in a report today, citing weakness of the Russian ruble,
Japanese yen and the Brazilian real against the euro. Should
rates fail to improve, Adidas will find it tough to reach its 17
billion-euro ($22 billion) revenue target for 2015, he said.  Adidas, based in Herzogenaurach,  Germany , makes more than
70 percent of its sales outside western  Europe .  “The company has huge international sales exposure, and
almost every currency has developed to its disadvantage,
massively hitting its profit generation ability,” Kuhn wrote.  Deutsche Bank cut its operating profit forecast for 2013 by
10 percent to 1.3 billion euros. More than 80 percent of the cut
was because of recent currency movements, the analyst said.  The shares were down 3.8 percent at 80.63 euros as of 10:30
a.m., the  second-biggest drop  in Germany’s benchmark DAX Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
