Most of the eastern U.S. is expected
to have seasonal temperatures by mid-July, according to Matt Rogers, president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The region east of the Mississippi River, including
 Chicago , New York and Washington, may have near-normal weather
from July 13 to July 17, Rogers said in his 11- to 15-day
forecast. Northern Maine, New Hampshire and  Vermont  may be 3
degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 Celsius) above normal while  Georgia ,
North Carolina and South Carolina may be 3 degrees lower.  “The 11- to 15-day still features the main heat in the
West,” Rogers, who’s based in Bethesda, Maryland, said in a
note to clients today.  Seasonal temperatures in the big cities of the East and
Midwest can hold down natural gas demand as fewer people turn to
air conditioners to keep cool. Power plants will account for 32
percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy Information
Administration data show.  Rogers said there’s a chance temperatures in the Great
Plains from North Dakota to  Texas  will be about 3 degrees above
normal from July 13 to 17, and the Pacific Northwest may have
temperatures 5 to 8 degrees higher than usual.  The normal average reading for July 15 in New York City is
about 77 degrees, according to the  National Weather Service . In
 Boston , it’s 74; Chicago, 74; and in Houston, 84.  To contact the reporter on this story:
