C&C Group Plc (GCC)  fell to its lowest in
eight months after saying that difficult trading conditions in
the first quarter are expected to persist and full-year
operating profit guidance was at the bottom of analysts’
estimates.  C&C fell as much as 9.9 percent in intraday Dublin trading
to 3.73 euros, the lowest since Nov. 2. The drinks maker was the
biggest decliner on the benchmark ISEQ Index.  “The trading statement this morning does little to
convince us with reasons as to why sentiment towards the stock
will improve in the near term,” said David Holohan, an analyst
at Merrion Stockbrokers in a note today. “We expect the share
price to continue to come under pressure.”  C&C said today it expects full-year operating profit of
between 125 million euros ($162 million) and 132 million euros,
compared with a mean estimate of 132 million euros, based on
nine analysts surved by Bloomberg. The Dublin-based drinks
company said first-quarter sales volumes in the U.K. and Ireland
were weaker, driven by unseasonably cold weather in March and
April.  In the U.K., cider volumes declined 22 percent in the three
months ended May 31, while volumes for beer brand Tennent
dropped 12 percent. In the U.S., volume growth for Woodchuck,
the cider brand acquired by the company last year, increased by
a lower-than-expected 3 percent.  About 1.18 million shares traded in the stock, the
equivalent of 80 percent of average daily traded volume over the
past three months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
