Nigeria ’s  inflation  rate fell to 9
percent in May, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said.  The inflation rate of Africa’s top oil producer fell from
9.1 percent in April, the Abuja-based statistics office said
today in an e-mailed report. The median estimate of seven
economists  surveyed  by  Bloomberg News  was 9 percent. Prices rose
0.7 percent in the month.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria , which targets an inflation
rate of less than 10 percent, may raise its  policy rate  if
government spending increases before the elections in 2015,
Governor Lamido Sanusi said on June 3. The bank’s Monetary
Policy Committee held its benchmark  interest rate  at a record 12
percent for the 10th consecutive meeting on May 21, concerned
spending is poised to rise as the military steps up operations
in the northeast against Islamist militants.  The inflation rate fell below 10 percent in January,
meeting the central bank’s target for the first time since
August 2011, as the impact of last year’s higher fuel prices
waned. Consumer prices will remain under 10 percent by December
if it remains under 10 percent by October, Sanusi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
