Daniel Paille scored with a 50-foot
wristshot in overtime to give the  Boston Bruins  a 2-1 victory
over the Chicago Blackhawks and even the National Hockey League
 Stanley Cup  Final at one game each.  Boston hosts Game 3 in the best-of-seven series tomorrow.  Paille scored the winning goal 13 minutes, 48 seconds into
overtime. In the series opener, the Blackhawks needed three
overtimes to beat the Bruins.  “Dan skated well tonight. His forecheck created
turnovers,” Bruins coach Claude Julien told reporters. “He
also was a lot stronger on the puck as far as battling, coming
up with it.”  Paille has scored three goals during the playoffs.  “We just kept the pressure going,” Paille said in a
televised interview. “I was able to hit [the puck] off the post
and it went in.”  Patrick Sharp  gave the Blackhawks a 1-0 lead at 11:22 of
the first period on his home ice at the United Center. Boston’s
 Chris Kelly  tallied his first playoff goal to tie the game 14
minutes, 58 seconds into the second period.  “We had the perfect start to the game, then we stopped
doing what made us successful,” said Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville. “We stood around. They countered.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
