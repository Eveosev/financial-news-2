Phil Mickelson  holed out for an
eagle from the fairway on the par-4 10th hole to retake the lead
during the final round of golf’s U.S. Open.  Mickelson jumped into the air with his arms raised after
his approach shot with a wedge hopped and then rolled forward
into the hole for an eagle that moved him back to even par at
Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania.  Jason Day,  Justin Rose  and  Hunter Mahan  are 1-over par at
the season’s second major championship.  Mickelson, seeking his fifth major win, entered the final
round as the only player in the field under par and had two
double-bogeys and a birdie before his eagle at No. 10.  Jason Dufner and Ernie Els finished 5-over par 285, while
Rickie Fowler and Steve Stricker are on the course at 5 over.  Tiger Woods , who was the pre-tournament favorite of
oddsmakers, finished 13-over par. Rory McIlroy, the world’s No.
2 player behind Woods, was 14 over and Masters Tournament
champion Adam Scott, ranked third in the world, finished 15-over.  To contact the reporter on this story:
