Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s government approved measures to create more than 3
billion euros ($4 billion) of funds for building roads and
railway lines.  The infrastructure spending will create 30,000 jobs, the
government said in a statement late yesterday. Other incentives
backed by the government include subsidized loans for as much as
5 billion euros for small companies that buy machinery and a
reform of the nation’s civil court proceedings to accelerate the
resolution of disputes.  Letta, on the job since April, is under pressure to revive
an economy that has been in recession since 2011. The European
Union should focus more on growth and job creation and less on
austerity after cuts to reduce  Italy ’s deficit worsened the
economic contraction, Letta has said.  The government agreed to abolish a tax on small boats and
to review port duties, according to the statement. The package
also includes plans to allow greater competition in the natural-gas market and lower of electricity charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
