Hedge funds  cut wagers on a gold
rally for the first time in three weeks on mounting speculation
central banks will curb record stimulus and as this year’s slump
in bullion spurred losses for billionaire  John Paulson .  The funds and other large speculators lowered their net-long position by 4.1 percent to 54,779  futures and options  by
June 11, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Net-bullish  wagers  across 18 U.S.-traded commodities rose 0.1
percent. Bearish copper bets more than doubled as the metal had
its longest slump since November. Cocoa holdings advanced to the
highest since 2008 before the biggest weekly slide since
January.  The  Bank of Japan  left a lending program unchanged on June
11 and refrained from expanding its toolkit for tackling
volatility in bonds. Federal Reserve policy makers meeting this
week may discuss slowing $85 billion of monthly debt purchases
amid signs of a sustained economic recovery. Gold surged 70
percent as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt from December
2008 through June 2011. Paulson’s Gold Fund tumbled 13 percent
in May, extending this year’s loss to 54 percent.  “There’s definitely a concern that if the Fed starts to
remove the monthly purchases, that’s certainly signaling a
strengthening in conditions, and that puts a bid into the dollar
and certainly at the margin hurts gold,” said  Ted Harper , a
 fund manager  at Frost Investment Advisors LLC in Houston, who
helps manage more than $9 billion of assets. Paulson’s “returns
are emblematic of the difficult environment that gold investors
have been facing,” he said.  Bear Market  Gold futures tumbled into a  bear market  in April and are
now down 17 percent since the start of the year at $1,383.10 an
ounce, heading for the first annual decline since 2000. Bullish
bets slumped 78 percent from a record in August 2011 and the
metal is 28 percent below its all-time high of $1,923.70 reached
in September 2011. Prices advanced 0.3 percent last week.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
rose less than 0.1 percent last week, while the UBS Bloomberg
CMCI gauge of 27 raw materials lost 0.8 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities fell 0.7 percent and the dollar
was down 1.2 percent against six major trading partners. A Bank
of America Corp. index shows Treasuries returned 0.3 percent.  Asset Purchases  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month the central
bank could curtail its  bond purchases  if the U.S. employment
outlook shows a sustainable improvement. Policy makers will trim
purchases to $65 billion a month in October, the median of 59
economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg this month shows.  Gold traders turned bearish for the first time in a month,
with 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg anticipating declining
prices this week. Fourteen were bullish and four neutral, the
largest proportion of bears since May 17.  Assets in global exchange-traded products backed by bullion
fell 20 percent this year as some investors lost faith in the
metal as store of value. U.S. consumer prices climbed 1.1
percent in the 12 months through April, according to a measure
watched by the Fed that excludes food and fuel. That matches the
smallest increase since records began in 1960. The  World Bank 
raised its 2013 U.S. growth forecast to 2 percent on June 12,
from a January prediction of 1.9 percent.  Paulson & Co.  Paulson & Co. said it has no intention of closing down its
Gold Fund even after this year’s losses, according to a letter
to investors obtained by  Bloomberg News . The company recommended
investors stay invested as valuations provide “significant
upside.” Paulson is the biggest investor in the  SPDR Gold
Trust (GLD) , the largest bullion ETP.  St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said June 10 that
inflation below the central bank’s 2 percent target may warrant
prolonging bond buying. The  International Monetary Fund  sees the
Fed maintaining large monthly bond purchases until at least the
end of this year and urged the central bank to carefully manage
its exit plan to avoid disrupting financial markets in its
annual assessment of the  U.S. economy  released June 14.  “If quantitative easing does continue for too long, that
could certainly lead to inflation,” said Christopher Burton, a
fund manager at Credit Suisse Asset Management in New York who
helps oversee $10.8 billion in commodity related assets. That
“would generally correspond to higher commodity prices,” he
said.  Total outflows from commodity funds were $315 million in
the week ended June 12, according to Ian Wilson, a managing
director for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which
tracks money flows. Investors withdrew $277 million from gold
funds, according to EPFR.  Goldman Sachs  Gold will continue to slide over the medium term on a “re-acceleration” in U.S. growth and a further unwinding of ETF
positions, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report June 12.
The bank sees the metal trading at $1,345 in 12 months.  Bullish bets on crude climbed 9.5 percent to 232,273

helps oversee $2 billion as chief investment officer at New

demand. We’re going to have to grow our way into more demand.
You’re not going to see the shortages that were feared.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
