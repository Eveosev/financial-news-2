Alex Ovechkin  was named the National
Hockey League’s Most Valuable Player for a third time.  The Washington Capitals right wing edged Sidney Crosby of
the Pittsburgh Penguins and John Tavares of the New York
Islanders to collect the Hart Trophy.  Ovechkin led the league with 32 goals during the regular
season. The last time he achieved the feat was in 2009, when he
won the MVP award for the second straight year.  Ovechkin is the eighth player after record nine-time
recipient Wayne Gretzky, Gordie Howe, Eddie Shore, Bobby Clarke,
 Mario Lemieux , Howie Morenz and Bobby Orr to win the Hart Trophy
at least three times.  Ovechkin collected 1,090 points to 1,058 for Crosby in
voting by members of the Professional Hockey Writers’
Association, making it the closest vote since 2002, when Jose
Theodore of the  Montreal Canadiens  edged Jarome Iginla of the
Calgary Flames on first-place votes after the two finished tied
in total ballots cast.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
