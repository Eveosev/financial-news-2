The Boston Celtics won’t consent to
 Doc Rivers  becoming coach of the Los Angeles Clippers without
receiving Eric Bledsoe and DeAndre Jackson in a corresponding
trade from Kevin Garnett, ESPN said.  The Clippers will not agree to include Bledsoe because they
want to retain  Chris Paul ’s backup for another trade once Paul
has committed to the Clippers, ESPN said, citing sources with
knowledge of the talks that it didn’t identify. Boston is also
insisting that the Clippers absorb the contract of Jason Terry
or Courtney Lee, ESPN said.  If neither side budges, the Clippers will change tack and
name Lionel Hollins or Brian Shaw as coach by June 19, ESPN
said. Rivers has three years and $21 million remaining on his
contract, the broadcaster reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
