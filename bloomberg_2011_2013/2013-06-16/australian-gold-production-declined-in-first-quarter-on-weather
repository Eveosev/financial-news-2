Gold output in  Australia , the
world’s second-biggest producer, fell in the first quarter as
wet weather disrupted some operations, mining consultant
Surbiton Associates Pty said.  Production was 63.5 metric tons in the three months through
March, about 5 percent less than the fourth quarter of 2012,
Melbourne-based Surbiton said in a statement. Output was about 1
percent higher than the same period a year earlier, it said.  “It’s the shortest quarter of the year,” Sandra Close, a
director at Surbiton, said in the statement. “In addition,
there was the usual dislocation due to wet weather from the
summer cyclones.”  Bullion dropped 4.6 percent in the first three months of
the year for the first back-to-back quarterly declines since
2001. Prices are down 17 percent this year and tumbled into a
 bear market  in April as some investors lost faith in the
precious metal as a store of value and an improving U.S. economy
increased concern the  Federal Reserve  may scale back debt
purchases that helped bullion cap a 12-year bull run in 2012.  In Australian dollar terms, the decline in prices since
April has been less dramatic as the local currency eased, Close
said. The Australian dollar tumbled 7.7 percent last month.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s largest gold producer,
said June 7 that it will write down the value of its assets by
as much as A$6 billion ($5.8 billion) after the slump in prices.  China was the world’s  biggest  gold producer in 2012
followed by Australia, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
