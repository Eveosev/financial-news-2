Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Russian President Vladimir Putin should stop
supporting “thugs” in the Syrian government.  “This is the G7 plus one. Let’s be blunt,” Harper told
reporters in Dublin today. “We in the West have a very
different perspective on this situation. Mr. Putin and his
government are supporting the thugs of the Assad regime for
their own reasons that I do not think are justifiable.”  While Canada wants Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to be
removed from power, the Canadian government doesn’t plan to
provide arms to the opposition, Harper said. “We do worry about
extremist elements in the opposition,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
