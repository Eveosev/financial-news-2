The value of gold relative to U.S.
equities has plunged to the lowest in more than four years even
as global debt surges.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the ratio between the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and the price of gold for immediate delivery
has dropped by almost a third in the past year, and on May 17
touched 0.815, the lowest since November 2008. The ratio was at
0.852 on June 14.  Gold prices fell 17 percent this year, while the  S&P 500 
jumped 14 percent, reaching a record on May 22. The precious
metal is heading for its first annual decline since 2000 amid
concern that the  Federal Reserve  will act to curb stimulus
measures as a quickening economic recovery in the U.S. prompted
investors to turn to equities.  “We’ve had a lot of  money flow  coming into equities, but
now you see that, historically, the S&P 500 may be a bit rich if
you’re actively managing your portfolio,” said Mike McGlone,
the New York-based director of research at ETF Securities Ltd.,
which provides exchange-traded products including some backed by
precious metals. “Fundamentals have not changed much in gold,
except that we’ve clearly had a correction. Relative to one
major financial asset, gold may be considered attractive.”  Bullion surged 58 percent since the end of 2008. The value
of global sovereign debt has almost doubled in that time to more
than $23 trillion, a Bank of America Corp. index shows. The
 International Monetary Fund  said June 14 it sees the Fed
maintaining its $85 billion monthly bond purchases until at
least the end of this year and urged the central bank to
carefully manage its exit plan to avoid disrupting financial
markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
