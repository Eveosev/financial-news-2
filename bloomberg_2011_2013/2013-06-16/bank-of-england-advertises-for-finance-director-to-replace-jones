The  Bank of England  advertised in
the Sunday Times newspaper today for a finance director to
replace Warwick Jones, who retires at the end of this month.  The finance director will report to the chief operating
officer, a role created to give the governor more time to focus
on policy responsibilities as the bank absorbs new powers to
oversee financial regulation. That position hasn’t been filled.
A COO appointment will be announced in due course, according to
a Bank of  England  spokeswoman who cannot be named, in line with
government policy.  The central bank said in October the new COO would be hired
in 2013, and would lead the search for the finance director. The
London-based BOE also said then that Jones’s retirement would
coincide with the departure of Governor  Mervyn King , who will be
replaced by  Mark Carney  at the end of this month.  Jones’s replacement will be responsible for all financial
performance and reporting at the Bank of England, the
advertisement said. The finance director will also set the
central bank’s financial targets and performance metrics to
contribute to the execution of its strategy, it said.  The closing date for applications is July 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
