Captain  Alastair Cook  scored 64 as
England got the win it needed to guarantee a place in cricket’s
Champions Trophy semifinals, beating New Zealand by 10 runs.  Rain delayed the start until 3:45 p.m. at Cardiff and the
match was reduced to 24 overs a side.  England was all out for 169 in its final allotted over.
Cook achieved his run haul off 47 balls, having been dropped
three times by Nathan McCullum, and Joe Root added 38. Kyle Mills took 4-30.  New Zealand, which had won the toss, was reduced to 27-3
after Luke Ronchi, Martin Guptill and  Ross Taylor  were out. Root
then made a diving catch to dismiss captain Brendon McCullum for
eight off Ravi Bopara.  Kane Williamson scored 67 as New Zealand recovered to
threaten a comeback win.  James Anderson  caught Williamson as the
umpires ruled that Stuart Broad’s delivery wasn’t a “no ball”
for overstepping the crease.  Corey Anderson was out after making 30 off 24 balls as New
Zealand finished on 159-8.  Anderson took 3-32, Bopara 2-26 and Tim Bresnan 2-41.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
