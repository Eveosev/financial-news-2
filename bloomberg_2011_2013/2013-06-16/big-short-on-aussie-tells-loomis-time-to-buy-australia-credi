No currency has ever fallen afoul of
investors as fast as the Aussie over the past two months. For
Loomis Sayles & Co.’s  Dan Fuss , that’s a buy signal.  Fuss, whose Loomis Sayles Bond Fund beat 97 percent of
peers in the past year with a 13 percent return, said he bought
Australian dollar debt of a U.S. bank to benefit from higher
yields and a positive exchange-rate outlook over three years.
Traders swung to a record 63,277 net positions betting on
declines on June 11, from net longs of 83,971 on April 2. That’s
the biggest 10-week reversal on record for major currency
contracts tracked by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  “We bought because of the fear and the decline,” in the
currency, said Boston-based Fuss. “We buy into down markets so
when a market’s coming down, be it a bond market, a stock
market, currencies -- preferably we get two of them together --
that’s when we buy. Our longer-term outlook for  Australia  is
actually relatively positive.”  Loomis’ confidence in the Aussie contrasts with a market
that drove it last week to the lowest level since September
2010. Fading mining investment has spurred concern that the
economy can’t cope with declining demand from China, causing
analysts to slash Aussie forecasts by the most among 50 currency
pairs since the end of April.  Stocks Slump  Stocks are slumping even after the central bank cut
borrowing costs to an all-time low. The  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51) 
dropped 2 percent in June, extending May’s 5.1 percent loss that
was the biggest in a year.  Bonds are also dropping following last month’s biggest
slide in 1 1/2 years. Benchmark  10-year yields  rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point today, to 3.39 percent. They
surged 27 basis points last month. The extra yield over similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries narrowed to 108 basis points on June 7,
the least since November 2008.  Fuss said his funds are focused on buying securities
maturing in about three years in Australia and similar markets,
unlike in 2008 when they bought the longest maturities amid
market declines. He didn’t say which bank’s bonds he had bought.  Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. led a surge in Australian bond sales by foreign borrowers
last month. Morgan Stanley sold A$700 million of November 2018
securities, paying 4.75 percent, or 194 basis points more than
government yields, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Yields Attract  “The pick-up in yield is substantial and the time to
maturity is long enough so that we feel good about the currency
over a three-year range,” he said. “We liked the underlying
credit for the U.S. bank, so it was a net addition to our
position in the Australian dollar.”  The  Loomis Sayles Bond Fund (LSBDX) ’s Aussie-denominated holdings
as of April 30 included 2017 notes issued by Morgan Stanley, the
state of New South  Wales ’ 2017 and 2018 bonds, and 2015
securities sold by the European Investment Bank, according to
 data  collected by Bloomberg. The fund’s Australian currency
exposure was approximately 3.5 percent at the end of the first
quarter, the firm said in April.  The 147,248 turnaround in Aussie futures surpasses the
143,968 reversal for contracts on  Japan ’s yen that took place in
the 10 weeks to Feb. 13, 2007, that had stood as the largest
drop on record for nine major exchange-rate based futures,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg from CFTC reports back
to 1993. Aussie net longs had reached an all-time high 103,376
on Dec. 11.  Aussie Plunging  The world’s fifth most-traded currency plunged 7.7 percent
this quarter to 96.19 U.S. cents as of 8:15 a.m. in  London , the
steepest slide among 31 major counterparts. It had soared 48
percent over the four years ended Dec. 31, the biggest gain.  Analysts forecast it will trade at 96 cents by year-end,
down from a prediction of $1.03 on April 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It will end 2014 at 94 cents.  The pessimism has been driven by domestic data suggesting
weaker demand, and comments from the central bank signaling the
key rate can go lower even after it was cut to a record 2.75
percent on May 7. Swaps traders are betting on a 57 percent
chance the rate will be 2.5 percent or less in August, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Royal Bank of Canada forecast last week the RBA will cut
next month and lower the benchmark to 2.25 percent by year-end,
as core inflation slows toward the bottom of the central bank’s
target range of 2 to 3 percent.  Australia’s economy expanded at the slowest annual pace in
almost two years in the first quarter as manufacturers and
builders detracted from growth. The 2.5 percent growth missed
economists’ median forecast for a 2.7 percent gain.  Commodity Turnaround  Estimates for  China  are also being trimmed with economists
projecting a 7.8 percent expansion this year, down from 8.1
percent at the start of 2013.  “We understand the near-term slowdown, we understand the
pressures in China,” said Fuss. On “the commodity demand and
price situation we’re not as bearish there three, four, five
years from now. That’s a fundamental difference in our
outlook.”  The Australian government is focused on running a balanced
budget and “very importantly” funds its retirement system,
taking away the biggest liability that a lot of nations have, he
said. The Aussie will also benefit from being identified as a
widely held reserve currency by the International Monetary Fund,
he said.  Versus the U.S. dollar “with a lot of bumps along the way,
big, big bumps, certainly positive there,” Fuss said. “Three
years from now is $1.05 possible? Yes, as a matter of fact we
happen to think it’s not only possible, it’s likely.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
