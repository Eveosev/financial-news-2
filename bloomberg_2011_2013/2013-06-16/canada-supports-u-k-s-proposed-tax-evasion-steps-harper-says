Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said his government supports measures proposed by the
U.K. to fight tax evasion.  Canada would have to consult its provinces before
implementing the steps, Harper told reporters at a news
conference in Dublin today.  British Prime Minister David Cameron has proposed that
leaders of the Group of Eight countries adopt tougher standards
to combat tax evasion at a summit in Northern Ireland that
begins tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
