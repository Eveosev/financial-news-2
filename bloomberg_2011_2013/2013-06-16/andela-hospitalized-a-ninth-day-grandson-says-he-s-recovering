Former South African President
 Nelson Mandela , hospitalized for a ninth day for treatment of a
lung infection, is recovering, President  Jacob Zuma  said today.  “We are grateful that he continues to get better,” Zuma
said in a speech in KwaZulu-Natal province. “Over the last two
days, although he remains serious, his doctors have stated that
his improvement has been sustained.”  Mandela, 94, was admitted to the intensive care unit of a
Pretoria hospital on June 8 for treatment of a recurrent lung
infection. It’s his fourth stay since December, after he was
treated for pneumonia in April and had gall stones removed.  Mandela was  South Africa ’s first black president after the
African National Congress party won the 1994 all-race elections
that ended apartheid in the continent’s biggest economy. He’s
also known by his clan name of Madiba.  “He continues to engage with family,” Zuma said in the
 speech  posted on the presidency’s website. “I invite you to
join me today, in wishing Madiba a very happy Father’s Day.”  The former president contracted tuberculosis on Robben
Island, off the coast of  Cape Town , where he spent most of its
27 years of imprisonment. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
