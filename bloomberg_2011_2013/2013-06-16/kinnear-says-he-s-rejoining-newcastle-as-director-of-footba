Joe Kinnear said he’s returning to
 Newcastle United  as director of football with a three-year
contract at the Premier League soccer team.  Kinnear, 66, had a spell as manager at Newcastle in the
2008-09 season but left after having a heart attack. He said
today he’ll focus on player recruitment in his new role.  “I believe I’m a very good judge of players and I’m a good
tactician,” he told  Sky Sports . “I intend to make Newcastle
far better than they are now.”  Newcastle, coached by  Alan Pardew , finished last season in
16th place in the 20-team league.  Kinnear has also coached clubs including Wimbledon, Luton
and Nottingham Forest. He spent most of his playing career at
Tottenham. He said he has no concerns over his health.  “I’m fit as a fiddle,” he said.  Newcastle’s press office didn’t immediately return a phone
call from Bloomberg News seeking confirmation of Kinnear’s
appointment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
