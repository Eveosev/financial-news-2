Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ)  DePuy Synthes
unit, a maker of artificial spinal repair products, won
$16 million in damages from  Globus Medical Inc. (GMED)  when a jury
decided that three of its patents were infringed.  A federal jury in Wilmington, Delaware, also decided June
14 after a two-week trial that the DePuy Synthes patents were
valid, according to court records.  Globus, based in Audubon,  Pennsylvania , was sued by the
patent owners in 2011. The trial began June 3 and was overseen
by U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark.  Ernie Knewitz, a Johnson & Johnson spokesman, declined to
immediately comment on the verdict. Ed Joyce, a Globus
spokesman, didn’t immediately return an e-mail today seeking
comment on it.  Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick,  New Jersey , the
world’s largest maker of health-care products, reported
$67.2 billion in sales last year. Globus reported $957.2 million
in fiscal 2012 sales.  The case is DePuy Synthes v. Globus Medical, 11-cv-00652,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patents in the lawsuit, click: 7,875,076;
