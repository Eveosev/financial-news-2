The rise of high-frequency trading
has eroded public confidence in equity markets,  NYSE Euronext (NYX) 
Chief Executive Officer  Duncan Niederauer  told lawmakers at a
House Financial Services subcommittee hearing in Washington.  “The public has never been more disconnected,” Niederauer
said today at a hearing called to examine ways to ensure
“orderly, efficient, innovative and competitive markets.” “At
the end of the day, the citizenry has lost trust and confidence
in the underlying mechanism,” he said.  Lawmakers and regulators have been reviewing innovations
such as high-frequency and algorithmic trading since a May 2010
market plunge temporarily erased $862 billion in U.S. equity
value. The Securities and Exchange Commission implemented
circuit breakers to halt trading when a company’s shares move 10
percent in five minutes, and SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  has
pushed for a marketwide surveillance system.  “What used to be an investors’ market is now thought of as
a traders’ market,” said Niederauer, 52, who runs the biggest
U.S. stock exchange operator. “We convinced ourselves along the
way that speed is synonymous with quality and in some cases it
might be. In other cases, it clearly isn’t.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
