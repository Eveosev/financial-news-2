The French government plans to cut
its workforce, trim spending and scrap subsidies for the
2013-2015 budget to help meet deficit targets,  Le Figaro 
reported today, citing an unidentified Budget Ministry official.  The plan, initiated by Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and
Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac, would require that all
ministries except the education, justice and interior ministries
face “severe” cuts, the newspaper reported. Each ministry will
be informed of their final budget by the end of July, the
newspaper said.  Cuts will include reducing the number of civil service jobs
by 2.5 percent annually, slashing operating costs -- including
car fleets -- by 10 percent next year and 3 percent for the two
following years. The planned budget will mean 40 percent less in
subsidies for all non-social welfare activities, such as
farming, cultural events, subsidies to non-governmental
organizations, Figaro said.  A Budget Ministry spokesperson, who declined to be
identified, denied the report when contacted by Bloomberg News.
The prime minister’s press office wasn’t immediately available
