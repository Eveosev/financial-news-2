Telekom Slovenije (TLSG)  d.d., Slovenia’s
state-owned phone company, must pay Sky Net d.o.o. 16.6 million
euros ($21.1 million) in damages for its failure to meet
contract terms, involving construction of base stations.  The district court in the capital Ljubljana said in its
interim ruling that Sky Net, which sought damages amounting to
26 million euros, be awarded a smaller amount, the Ljubljana-
based Telekom said in a regulatory  statement  today.  Telekom Slovenije said it’s still studying the ruling and
its impact on shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
