Mexican bonds headed for the longest
winning streak since January after the  Federal Reserve  said it
would expand a program to promote U.S. growth.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.76 percent at
12:19 p.m. in Mexico City, the lowest level on a closing basis
since the securities were issued in January 2005. The price
increased 0.42 centavo to 137.70 centavos per peso. Yields are
headed to their fifth straight daily decline for the first time
since the period ended Jan. 20.  The Fed said today it would expand Operation Twist, a
program to replace short-term bonds with longer-term debt, by
$267 billion through the end of the year in a bid to “put
downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.” They left
unchanged their view that economic conditions will probably
warrant keeping interest rates “exceptionally low” at least
through late 2014.  “Demand in general for Mexican debt is going to remain
strong,” Aryam Vazquez, an economist for global  emerging
markets  at  Wells Fargo & Co ., said by phone from  New York . “The
fact that these are higher yielding bonds in a low risk country
solidifies demand.”  Mexico’s central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged for the 27th straight meeting this month at a record
low 4.5 percent.  “It obviously is very attractive when you look at it
relative to markets like the U.S.,” Vivienne Taberer, a
portfolio manager with Investec Asset Management, said by phone
from London, before the Fed released its statement.  The peso increased 0.2 percent to 13.6629 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
