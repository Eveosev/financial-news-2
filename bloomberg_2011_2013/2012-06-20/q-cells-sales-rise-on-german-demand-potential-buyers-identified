Q-Cells SE (QCE) , the German solar-cell
and module maker that filed for insolvency in April, said first-
quarter sales grew 12 percent, buoyed by domestic demand as its
search for a buyer continued.  Sales climbed to 140 million euros ($178 million) from
125.1 million euros a year earlier as the German government’s
planned subsidy cuts “significantly stimulated” demand, the
Thalheim-based company said today in a  report  on its website.  Q-Cells, which hired Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd. to look
for an investor, said potential buyers have been “identified
and contacted throughout the world.” Interested parties include
financial and strategic investors, according to the company,
which is also studying the possibility of a debt-to-equity swap
that most creditors agreed to in February.  Germany ’s BSW solar industry association said in April it
expected a rally in installations through September as
developers sought to beat planned subsidy cuts. Profit margins
have been squeezed after a glut of cells and panels dragged down
prices, and at least six German solar companies filed for
insolvency since December.  Q-Cells, which this month agreed to sell its Solibro thin-
film business to  China ’s Hanergy Holding Group, said production
has increased in the second quarter amid higher demand. That may
help it build on a 37 percent jump in first-quarter sales
volumes.  The company had about 200 million euros in cash and cash
equivalents at the end of the quarter, down from about 305
million euros at the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
