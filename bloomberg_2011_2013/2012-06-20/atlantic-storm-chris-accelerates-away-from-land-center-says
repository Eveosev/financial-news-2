Tropical Storm Chris accelerated as
it moved away from land over the North Atlantic about 565 miles
(909 kilometers) from Cape Race,  Newfoundland , according to the
 U.S. National Hurricane Center .  Chris, which formed yesterday as the  third named storm  of
the  Atlantic hurricane season , was traveling east-southeast at
about 13 miles per hour, the Miami-based center said in a web
 advisory  at 11 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time yesterday. The storm
packed maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, below the minimum 74
mph that would categorize it as a hurricane on the  Saffir-
Simpson scale .  “Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours,” the center said. “There are no coastal watches or
warnings in effect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
