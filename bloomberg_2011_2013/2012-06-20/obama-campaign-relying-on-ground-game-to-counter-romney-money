President  Barack Obama ’s campaign
officials say they are braced for an election decided by a
razor-thin margin and are counting on their political
organization in key states to overcome what they expect will be
Republican  Mitt Romney ’s money advantage.  The president’s political advisers said that outside
political action committees supporting Romney are likely to pour
as much as $1 billion into the race, outspending Obama and the
Democrats. One of the so-called super PACs supporting Romney,
Restore Our Future, reported raising almost $5 million in May
and had about $8.4 on hand at the end of the month.  Obama’s campaign advisers, who asked for anonymity to brief
reporters on election tactics, said their advantage will be
their extensive operation to identify and turn out Obama voters.
The campaign, for example, has 35 offices in  Ohio  and 40 in
Florida, two crucial swing states in November, the officials
said.  Romney’s fundraising outpaced Obama’s last month. Romney
and his general-election partners, the Romney Victory Fund,
raised $76.8 million in May, the campaign previously said. Obama
and his joint committee raised about $60 million, his campaign
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
