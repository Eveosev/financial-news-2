England’s Football Association was
fined 5,000 euros ($6,360) by UEFA for the “inappropriate”
conduct of its supporters during a 3-2 win against Sweden at
soccer’s European Championship on June 15.  There was an attempted invasion of the field by England
supporters during the Group D match in Kiev, European soccer’s
governing body said today in a  statement  on its website.  The F.A. will be able to lodge an appeal within 24 hours of
receiving the written verdict.  England advanced to the quarterfinals last night as Group D
winner following a 1-0 victory against co-host Ukraine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
