Iran ’s government may have to abandon
efforts to rein in inflation by forbidding producers to increase
prices, the  Jomhouri Eslami  newspaper reported.  The cost of a liter of milk and a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of
wheat for local producers are 8,000 rials (0.65 cents) and 5,000
rials respectively, according to the newspaper, which typically
reflects the views of the Iranian leadership. Producers can’t be
expected to continue selling milk to the government at the
official prices of 6,300 rials and 4,200 rials, it said.  Producer costs rose by between 34 percent and 37 percent in
the Iranian year that ended in March, Jomhouri Eslami said,
citing central bank figures. International sanctions imposed on
Iran to curb its nuclear program have weakened the rial and
added to inflationary pressures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
