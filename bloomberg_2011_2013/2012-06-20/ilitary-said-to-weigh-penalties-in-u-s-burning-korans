U.S. Army and Navy officials are
weighing a recommendation for administrative punishment, not
criminal charges, for as many as seven service personnel in
connection with the burning of Korans in  Afghanistan , according
to a U.S. official.  As many as seven personnel, including one Navy service
member, were recommended for administration sanctions for their
roles in the February burnings of copies of the Muslim
scripture, according to the official, who asked not to be
identified because a final decision hasn’t been made.  The recommendations are contained in a U.S. Central Command
investigation into the incident at Bagram Air Base that led to
at least three days of rioting and protests by Afghan citizens.
The recommended punishment was reported late yesterday by the
 Associated Press .  U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Jimmie E. Cummings Jr., a
spokesman for the NATO International Security Assistance Force
in Afghanistan, urged “caution regarding any speculation over
the outcome of the case.”  “The legal processes are continuing according to
appropriate investigative procedures, and options are available
to decision authorities” of the affected military services,
Cummings said today in an e-mailed statement.  In February, Pentagon spokesman Douglas Wilson told
reporters that, based on preliminary results, “We do not
believe that this was something where those involved intended to
burn the Koran as a religious document.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
