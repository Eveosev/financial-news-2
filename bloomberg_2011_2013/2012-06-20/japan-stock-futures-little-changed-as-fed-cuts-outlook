Japanese stock futures were little
changed after the  Federal Reserve  cut its estimates for U.S.
economic growth and expanded its Operation Twist stimulus
program amid a slowdown in hiring.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a Japanese
construction machinery maker, slid 0.6 percent.  Olympus Corp. (7733) 
may be active after President Hiroyuki Sasa said the company is
considering raising about 50 billion yen ($633 million) to boost
capital that declined by more than half after the Japanese
camera maker admitted to a 13-year accounting fraud. ADRs of
 Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas
producer, declined 0.7 percent as crude fell to an eight-month
low.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average were bid in the
pre-market at 8,790 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. The gauge
closed at 8,785 in Chicago yesterday. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
recouped losses and was little changed after first-quarter gross
domestic product expanded 1.1 percent, beating the average
economist estimate for 0.4 percent growth. Futures on
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.4 percent.  “Markets had been hoping for a little bit more from the
Fed,” said Stan Shamu, a market strategist at IG Markets in
Melbourne, a provider of trading services in stocks, bonds and
commodities. “Sentiment has really slumped after the lower
growth forecast.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The gauge retreated 0.2 percent yesterday after the Fed
report. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index yesterday gained 0.6 percent
ahead of the Fed statement amid optimism the U.S. central bank
would add to stimulus measures to spur growth.  Operation Twist  The U.S. central bank cut its estimates for growth and said
it sees little progress on unemployment during the rest of the
year. The Fed lowered its central tendency estimate for U.S.
2012 gross domestic product growth to 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent
from 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent in April.  The Fed will expand its Operation Twist program to replace
short-term bonds with longer-term debt by $267 billion through
the end of 2012. That “should put downward pressure on longer-
term interest rates and help to make broader financial
conditions more accommodative,” the  Federal Open Market
Committee  said.  “If we don’t see continued improvement in the labor
market, we’ll be prepared to take additional steps if
appropriate,” Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told reporters after
the FOMC’s two-day meeting. He said those steps might include
additional asset purchases.  Yearly Loss  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  lost 9.5 percent through yesterday
from this year’s highest level in February amid signs global
economic growth was slowing as Europe struggled to contain its
debt crisis. This left the gauge trading at 1.2 times book
value, compared with 2.1 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for
the Stoxx 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A number
below one means companies can be bought for less than value of
their assets.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
retreated 1.6 percent yesterday. Crude oil for July delivery
fell $2.23 to $81.80 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since Oct. 5. The more actively
traded August contract dropped $2.90, or 3.4 percent, to $81.45.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in New York fell 1 percent, the most since
June 1, to 93.20 yesterday in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
