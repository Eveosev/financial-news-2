UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings
against  Croatia â€™s soccer federation for a third time at the
European Championship over the actions of its fans.  The European governing body said in a  statement  on its
website Croatian fans set off and threw fireworks and also
displayed racist banners and symbols during a 1-0 defeat to
Spain in the final round of group matches in Gdansk, Poland, two
days ago.  Additionally, the Croatian team was charged with improper
conduct after six members received yellow cards during the game.
UEFA said its disciplinary board will hear the case on June 24.  It comes a day after the Croatian body was fined 80,000
euros ($102,000) for fans setting off fireworks and using racist
chants and symbols during a June 14 match against Italy. The
federation was earlier fined 25,000 euros for supporter actions
during its opening match against Ireland on June 10.  Croatia was eliminated after finishing third in Group C
behind Spain and Italy, who advanced to the quarterfinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
