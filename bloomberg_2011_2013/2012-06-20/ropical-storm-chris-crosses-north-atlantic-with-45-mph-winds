Tropical Storm Chris is moving east
across the North Atlantic off  Newfoundland  with winds of 50
miles (80 kilometers) per hour, posing no threat to land, the
National Hurricane Center said today.  The storm, bearing heavy showers, is about 600 miles south
of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and little change in strength is
expected over the next two days, the center said in an advisory
at 11 a.m. East Coast time. It may become a post-tropical
cyclone by tomorrow.  The center is  also monitoring  a low-pressure system that
will bring heavy rain to southern Florida, Cuba, the Bahamas and
the  Cayman Islands  as it moves northwest into the  Gulf of
Mexico . The system has a 20 percent chance of becoming tropical
in the next two days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
