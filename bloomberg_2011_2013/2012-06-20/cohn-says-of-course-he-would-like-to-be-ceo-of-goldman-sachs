Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  President
and Chief Operating Officer  Gary Cohn  said he would like to be
chief executive officer of the firm and is “very happy” in his
current job.  “Of course I would like to be CEO of Goldman Sachs, but I
am very happy in the job I am in now,” Cohn, 51, said today in
an interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television’s
“Market Makers.”  When Lloyd C. Blankfein succeeded Henry M. Paulson as
Goldman Sachs’s chairman and CEO six years ago, Cohn was named
as one of Blankfein’s top lieutenants, making him a leading
candidate to be the next head of the firm. Blankfein said last
week that he has a “tough job to leave,” and that most of his
predecessors left for government jobs.  “I would say the government isn’t going to call me up,”
Blankfein told reporters after participating in a discussion at
the  Chicago  Club in Chicago. “So that means staying forever or
dying at my desk.”  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
 declined  25 percent since March 26 as investors became more
concerned about the European debt crisis and analysts cut profit
outlooks for banks. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $2 billion trading
loss, announced May 10, has led some analysts to predict
regulators will craft tougher rules to keep lenders from making
speculative bets.  Goldman Sachs probably will earn $2.03 a share in the
second quarter, according to the average  estimate  of 25 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
