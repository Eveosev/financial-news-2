Iran  exported $11.4 million of
gasoline in the two months since March 20, or 8.4 percent of
what it shipped the entire previous year, the  Iranian Students
News Agency  reported, citing customs authorities.  OPEC’s second-largest oil producer exported $134.8 million
of motor fuel in the 12 months ending March 19, the end of the
last Iranian calendar year, the state-run  news agency  said.
Gasoline exports fell 31.8 percent in the first two months of
the new year, according to the report, which didn’t specify the
earlier period against which it was comparing.  The Persian Gulf country says it has become self-sufficient
in gasoline production since domestic use decreased following a
phase-out out of energy subsidies that began in December 2010.
President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said last December that Iran,
which is grappling with international trade and financial
sanctions over its nuclear program, seeks to become a “major”
gasoline exporter by 2013. The country hasn’t imported any of
the fuel in the last two years, the report said.  About $10.8 million of Iranian-made gasoline went to the
United Arab Emirates during the latest two-month period, the
agency said. Buyers last year included  Afghanistan , Armenia,
Iraq and Oman, as well as the U.A.E., according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
