The  New York Yankees  failed to chalk
up their first 11-game winning streak in almost 27 years with a
4-3 defeat to the visiting  Atlanta Braves .  The Yankees haven’t won 11 straight Major League Baseball
games since September 1985. The team’s record run of 19
consecutive wins was set from June 29 to July 17, 1947. Last
night’s defeat was New York’s second in 10 games at Yankee
Stadium.  Nick Swisher  gave the home team the lead in the second
inning with a two-run double. The Braves cut the deficit in the
third when Jason Heyward scored on Andrelton Simmons’s
groundout, and Atlanta took a 3-2 lead on a run-scoring double
by  Chipper Jones  and an RBI single by Simmons in the fourth.  Raul Ibanez  scored on an error by Atlanta third baseman
Jones in the fourth before the Braves got the decisive run in
the sixth on a run-scoring infield single by Heyward.  It was the first game this season at Yankee Stadium without
a home run. New York is now 1-13 in games where it hasn’t hit a
home run this year.  Yankees starting pitcher Hiroki Kuroda dropped to 6-7 after
giving up four runs on six hits in seven innings. Atlanta
starter Tim Hudson improved to 5-3 after surrendering three runs
on four hits in five innings. Four Atlanta relievers kept the
Yankees scoreless for four innings to secure the win.  The Braves, whose three-game series against the Yankees
concludes today, improved to 36-32 with their second win in nine
games. The Yankees (41-26) remain 2 1/2 games ahead of the
 Baltimore Orioles  (39-29) atop the American League East
division.  The  New York Mets  logged their second straight 5-0 win
against the Orioles to improve to 37-32, three games behind the
National League East-leading Washington Nationals (38-27), who
lost 5-4 to the Tampa Bay Rays last night.  It was Washington’s fourth straight defeat since the
Yankees ended the Nationals’ six-game winning streak on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
