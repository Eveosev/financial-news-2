Hong Kong   stocks  advanced, with the
benchmark index closing at its highest level in a month, amid
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will take measures to
bolster growth and as leaders from the Group of 20 Nations
pledged to support Europe in its struggle with debt.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , maker of power tools that relies
on  North America  for almost three quarters of its sales, climbed
2.6 percent.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s largest bank, rose 2.3
percent. Sands China Ltd., the Asian unit of  Sheldon Adelson ’s
Las Vegas company, gained 3.3 percent after Deutsche Bank AG
said Macau casino share prices don’t reflect stronger revenue
prospects.  “The focus will be the outcome of tonight’s  Federal
Reserve  meeting,” said Tim Leung, who helps manage about $1.5
billion at IG Investments Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Since what’s
happening in Europe is causing some concern, there will be
expectation of more easing from the Fed.”  The Hang Seng Index climbed 0.5 percent to 19,518.85, its
highest close since May 15. Two stocks rose for each that fell
on the 49-company gauge. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
of mainland stocks added 0.2 percent at 9,821.22 after a report
that an influential Chinese advisory committee called for
“really proactive” economic policies to boost growth.  Hong Kong’s benchmark index has fallen about 10 percent
from this year’s peak in February amid concern economic growth
is slowing in the U.S. and China, while Europe’s crisis spreads.
Companies on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  traded  at 10 times estimated
earnings on average yesterday, compared with 13 for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index and 10.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Operation Twist  Signs of slowing growth amid Europe’s turmoil could mean
the Fed, which ends a two-day meeting today, extends its so-
called Operation Twist, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Jefferies & Co. The program involves selling short-term debt and
buying longer-term bonds.  Techtronic Industries, which makes Ryobi power tools and
Hoover vacuum clears, added 2.6 percent to HK$9.16. Li & Fung
Ltd., a supplier of clothes and toys to Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
advanced 1.9 percent to HK$15.76.  Euro-area leaders at the Group of 20 summit pledged to
“take all necessary policy measures” to defend the currency
union and boost protection of the region’s struggling banks,
according to the final statement issued at a meeting in Mexico.  Shares of companies that do business in Europe advanced
after  Spain  beat a target for bond sales at an auction yesterday
and concern eased that the debt crisis is spreading. HSBC gained
2.3 percent to HK$68.45.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , which relies on
Europe for most of its sales, gained 2.6 percent to HK$10.30.  Esprit Gains  Shares of Esprit also rose after its largest shareholder
Lone Pine Capital LLC increased its stake in the clothier. The
hedge fund bought 1.39 million shares at an average HK$10.56
apiece on June 13, according to Hong Kong Stock Exchange data.  Hang Seng Index futures expiring this month rose 1.1
percent to 19,572. The HSI Volatility Index fell 3 percent to
22.3, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.4 percent on
the gauge during the next 30 days.  China’s fiscal policy should be “really proactive” and
macroeconomic policies should be readjusted to sustain faster
growth,  China Daily  cited the Standing Committee of the Chinese
People’s Political Consultative Conference National Committee as
saying.  Sands China (1928)  gained 3.3 percent to HK$26.30 after Deutsche
Bank analyst  Karen Tang  said investors have been too pessimistic
about the outlook for gambling revenue.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. rose 6.6 percent to
HK$20.25. Wynn Macau Ltd. advanced 5 percent HK$18.48. Shares of
the casinos have plunged more than 18 percent since the start of
May on concern that demand among high-end gamblers is falling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
