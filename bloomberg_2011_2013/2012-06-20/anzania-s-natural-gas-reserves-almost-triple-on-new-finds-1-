Tanzania ’s total estimated natural
gas reserves almost tripled to as much as 28.7 trillion cubic
feet with recent offshore discoveries including one by  Statoil
ASA (STL) , Energy Minister Sospeter Muhongo said.  The energy ministry plans to submit a draft natural gas
policy and propose legislative amendments in September, the
minister said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The ministry
estimated total reserves at 10 trillion cubic feet in September.  “It is important to ensure that this pace of oil and gas
exploration continues,” Muhongo said.  Tanzania and Mozambique have discovered about 100 trillion
cubic feet of gas, almost enough to meet global demand for a
year, as the world’s biggest explorers have poured into  East
Africa  to search for hydrocarbons and finds have increased in
Kenya and Uganda.  Recent finds off Tanzania’s Indian Ocean coast brought
recoverable offshore reserves to 21 trillion cubic feet, while
onshore fields were estimated at 4.27 trillion cubic feet to
7.77 trillion cubic feet, the ministry said in the statement.  Statoil, Norway’s largest oil and gas producer, on June 14
said it made a second “high-impact" gas find off Tanzania’s
Indian Ocean coast.  BG Group Plc and  Ophir Energy Plc (OPHR)  in May said they
discovered more gas off Tanzania, about 45 kilometers (28 miles)
north of the maritime border with Mozambique, where explorers
have made the largest gas discoveries of the decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
