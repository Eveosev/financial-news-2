New York  gasoline weakened after
imports of the fuel to the region rose to the highest level
since January as demand for the cargo is expected to fall.  Total gasoline  imports  to the East Coast gained 327,000
barrels a day to 934,000 barrels last week, according to Energy
Department data. It’s the highest level since Jan. 27.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in New York Harbor fell 0.5 cent to 8.5 cents a gallon over
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:58
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
fell 4.59 cents to $2.6856 a gallon.  The supply of tankers available to haul European gasoline
across the Atlantic Ocean is set to increase as U.S. demand for
cargoes of the auto fuel slows, a Bloomberg survey showed.  As many as 47 medium range vessels may be available for the
voyage over the coming two weeks to July 4, the median estimate
of six shipbrokers and owners who specialize in transporting
gasoline showed  yesterday. That’s an 18 percent increase from
the prior two-week period, according to survey data.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  weakened by 2 cents to a
premium of 1 cent a gallon against futures.  Western Refining Inc. (WNR)  reported a crude unit upset at its El
Paso refinery in  Texas  yesterday, according to a filing with
state regulators.  A feed interruption caused an upset in the North crude unit
and the unit was stabilized, the company said in a filing with
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
