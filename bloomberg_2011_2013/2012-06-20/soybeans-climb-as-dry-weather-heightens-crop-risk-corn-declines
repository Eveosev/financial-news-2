Soybeans advanced for a fourth
consecutive session as dry weather in the U.S. Midwest
heightened concern supply will be damaged and trail a government
forecast. Corn declined.  Temperatures in the Ohio River Valley in the eastern
Midwest will be “very high” today, and daily rainfall totals
in the next two days likely will be less than 0.25 inch (0.6
centimeter), AccuWeather Inc. said today. Crop conditions in
the U.S. deteriorated in the two weeks through June 17,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  “Concerns around weather conditions particularly in the
U.S. provided a boost to prices across the complex,”  Michael Creed , an agribusiness economist at  National Australia Bank
Ltd. (NAB) , said by phone from Melbourne today.  Soybeans for November delivery rose 0.5 percent to $13.92 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 11:17 a.m.  London  time,
up 6.4 percent since June 14. Corn for December delivery fell
0.4 percent to $5.6125, after jumping 11 percent in the previous
two days, the most since October 2010.  Soybean prices still have “fairly significant upside”
because the USDA has projected that supplies will tighten in the
next year, while the rally in corn “got a little overdone”
because a jump in U.S. acreage means
production will likely expand, said  Dave Norris , an independent
grain broker in Harrogate,  England .  Corn Plantings  U.S. farmers planted 95.9 million acres of corn, the most
since 1937, and 73.9 million acres of soybeans, 1.5 percent less
than a year earlier, the USDA said March 30. The agency will
update its planting estimate on June 29. U.S. soybean stockpiles
on Aug. 31 may total 175 million bushels, before sliding to 140
million in the following year, the USDA said June 12.  “Soybeans are the one market that still has the potential
to have fairly significant upside, because old crop stocks are
very tight,” Norris said. “The whole world has to get through
to 2013 with the soybeans that America can produce this year,
because the Brazilian and Argentine harvests are a long way
off.”  Wheat for December delivery was little changed at $6.9375 a
bushel in  Chicago . In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat was
up 0.1 percent at 210.50 euros ($267) a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
