Spain  has a dry and warm spring with
below-normal rainfall, the  Agriculture Ministry  reported.  Rainfall in the March-through-May period was 147
millimeters (5.8 inches), 16 percent below normal, the ministry
wrote in a  report  on its website today. Temperatures averaged
14.1 degrees Celsius (57.4 degrees Fahrenheit), 1.1 degrees
higher than normal for the three-month span.  “The only relatively wet month of the trimester was April,
while both in March and May there was a clear precipitation
deficit compared with normal values,” the ministry wrote.  Spanish winter-grain production may fall 33 percent to 11.4
million metric tons after dry weather hurt crops, farm and food-
industry group Cooperativas Agro-Alimentarias forecast earlier
this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
