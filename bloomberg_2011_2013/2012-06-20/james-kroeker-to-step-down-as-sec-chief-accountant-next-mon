The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission announced its second high profile resignation in less
than a week today when it said that James Kroeker, its chief
accountant, will leave the agency in July.  Kroeker, 42, joined the SEC in 2007 as deputy chief
accountant before becoming the agency’s top accountant in 2009.
During his time at the agency, Kroeker focused on a review of
fair value accounting standards and sought to improve reporting
of off-balance sheet assets.  “Jim has provided superb counsel on a range of accounting
and auditing related matters and has always stressed the
importance of accounting to our investor protection mission,”
SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said in a statement.  The SEC said Kroeker plans to return to the private sector.
His departure follows a June 15 announcement that former  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  executive Eileen Rominger would step down next
month as head of the SEC’s investment management unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
