Manila Water  Co., which provides
water to half of the Philippine capital, said its Rizal project
will bring surface water supplies to about 1 million residents.  On completion, the 4.6 billion-peso ($109 million)
Rodriguez water system project that includes a new treatment
plant and distribution mainline thatâ€™s the largest water system
built by Manila Water in its 15 years of existence will serve as
an alternative water treatment plant to the Balara facility, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
