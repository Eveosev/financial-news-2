SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA)  jumped
to a three-month high in New York after Moness Crespi Hardt &
Co. said the products of the Israeli maker of soda machines are
selling out at  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)   SodaStream, based in Airport City,  Israel , surged 6.1
percent to $37.60 by the close in New York, the highest since
March 12. The shares have advanced 15 percent in 2012 and trade
at 17.9 times estimated earnings, compared with a 15.8 multiple
for companies on the  Nasdaq Composite Index. (CCMP)   The number of Wal-Mart stores in the U.S. that are out of
stock or have a limited number of the company’s soda makers has
grown every week since June 4, according to the e-mailed Moness
Crespi report dated today. Inventory of SodaStream products also
decreased at Target Corp. and Macy’s Inc. following Father’s
Day, the report showed. SodaStream  said last month that it
rolled out beverage  products  in 2,900 Wal-Mart stores in the
U.S.  “The percentage of stores that are selling out is creeping
up consistently,” Jim Chartier, a New York-based analyst at
Moness Crespi, who recommends buying the stock, said by phone
today. “The machines are selling well in Wal-Mart and following
the same trend of all the other retailers. This is being
received positively.”  Inventory was also dwindling for SodaStream beverage mixes
including  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) ’s Crystal Light and Country Time
lemonade, the report said.  “This signals strong performance that might convince new
partners to sign on with the company,” Chartier said. “Soda is
doing well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
