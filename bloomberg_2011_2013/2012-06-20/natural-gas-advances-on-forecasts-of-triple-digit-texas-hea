Natural gas futures in  New York  rose
to the highest price in almost four weeks on forecasts of
hotter-than-normal weather that would boost demand for the fuel
to produce electricity.  Gas gained as much as 5.3 percent as Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, predicted above-normal
temperatures in the southern and central U.S. from June 25
through June 29. The high in Dallas on June 25 may be 101
degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), 8 higher than usual, according
to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.  “The market is following the thermometer,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.
“There’s no doubt that it’s a very hot start to the summer, and
that’s turning out to be supportive for prices.”  Natural gas for July delivery rose 8.6 cents, or 3.4
percent, to $2.631 per million British thermal units at 9:07
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures advanced
$2.679 per million Btu in earlier electronic trading, the
highest intraday price since May 24. Gas fell to a 10-year
intraday low of $1.902 on April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
