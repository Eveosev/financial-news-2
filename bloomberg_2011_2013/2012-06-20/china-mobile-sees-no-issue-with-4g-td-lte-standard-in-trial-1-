China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s
largest phone company by users, said its ongoing trial of
fourth-generation TD-LTE  network equipment  is going smoothly and
it has uncovered no issues with the technology.  The biggest bottleneck for adoption of the new standard is
availability of devices, Chairman  Xi Guohua  said at the GSMA
Mobile Asia Expo in  Shanghai  today. “If we have enough devices,
we can build the base stations in a short period of time; we can
upgrade our current technology to TD-LTE in a short period of
time,” he said.  China  Mobile is counting on a shift to 4G wireless service
to help expand its data customer base, after incompatibility of
its homegrown 3G network with popular devices such as Apple
Inc.’s iPhone led the company to lose market share to  China
Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762)  and  China Telecom Corp. (728)  Rising demand
for data, to access the Internet to watch videos and play games,
is replacing traditional voice and text services, Xi said.  The wireless operator will probably expand its TD-LTE
trial, currently planned for 10 cities with 20,000 base stations
this year, Xi said. The total number of 4G base stations will
exceed 200,000 by 2013, China Mobile said in March.  “It depends on how fast the whole industry develops,” Xi
said. “The device front is the bottleneck. There is no problem
from the technology standpoint.”  ZTE Corp. (000063) , China’s second-biggest maker of telephone
equipment, plans to release TD-LTE handsets by the end of this
year or early next year, President Shi Lirong said separately at
the conference.  Ecosystem, Supply Chain  “We hope more and more vendors and suppliers will join in
the TD-LTE ecosystem and supply chain, so step by step the
operators, carriers and vendors can all get a win-win
stituation” Shi said.  China Mobile fell 0.4 percent to HK$82.10 as of 11:50 a.m.
in Hong Kong trading. The stock has advanced 8.2 percent this
year, compared with a 5.7 percent gain for the city’s benchmark
 Hang Seng Index . ZTE rose 0.5 percent to HK$14.90 today.  As of the end of April, China Mobile had 672.5 million
mobile-phone subscribers, according to company figures. The
number exceeded China Unicom’s 212.8 million and China Telecom’s
138.5 million in the same period.  China Mobile’s share of all wireless users in China will
drop to 64 percent this year from 69 percent in 2010, Anand
Ramachandran, an analyst at Barclays Capital Inc., wrote in
March. The share of China Unicom will rise to 22 percent from 20
percent over the same period, he estimated.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
