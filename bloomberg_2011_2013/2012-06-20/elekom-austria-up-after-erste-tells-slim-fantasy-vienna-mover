Telekom Austria  AG, the network
operator that last week drew an investment from Mexican
billionaire  Carlos Slim , rose in Vienna after Erste Group
advised investors that they should accumulate the stock.  Telekom Austria rose as much as 6 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
8.05 euros a share and traded at 8.048 euros at 9:26. a.m. in
Vienna. Erste, which previously told clients to reduce their
Telekom Austria holdings, raised the company’s target price by
10 percent to 9 euros a share.  The new recommendation is based on the “takeover fantasy”
inspired by Slim’s commitment to take a 26 percent stake in the
company, analyst Vera Sutedja wrote in a report published today.  “It is possible that  America Movil (AMXL)  will not stop at the
current level of ownership,” Sutedja wrote, referencing Slim’s
flagship company. “One buys into this stock with the
expectation that another investor would buy at a higher price in
the future to gain more control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
