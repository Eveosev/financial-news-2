Gold was set for its worst weekly
loss this year after the U.S. Federal Reserve didn’t resume a
debt purchase program even as the economy showed signs of
slowing. Silver was poised for its worst week since December.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.3 percent to $1,561.75 an ounce
before trading at $1,562.75 by 10:24 a.m. in  Singapore , down 4
percent this week, the most since the five days to Dec. 16.
Bullion dropped 2.6 percent yesterday, the most since Feb. 29,
tumbling with other commodities as the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Spot Index of 24 raw materials slumped 22 percent from this
year’s highest close, entering a  bear market .  Manufacturing in the Philadelphia region shrank in June at
the fastest pace in almost a year and sales of existing homes in
the U.S. fell in May, separate reports showed yesterday. The Fed
on June 20 extended its program of replacing short-term bonds
with longer-term debt by $267 billion through the end of 2012,
without announcing further debt purchases.  “Bullion prices dive as the Fed statement echoes in the
Market,”  James Steel , an analyst at HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.,
said in a note. “Poor euro-zone economic data and a decline in
the euro may have contributed to a drop in  gold prices . Near-
term momentum may take prices lower, but we believe it may
create an attractive point of entry for gold.”  August-delivery bullion was little changed at $1,564.90 an
ounce on the Comex in  New York . Futures declined yesterday as
the slump in equities and commodities drove the dollar up by the
most since March against a six-currency basket. The  S&P 500
Index  fell 2.2 percent for its second-biggest loss in 2012.  China, Europe  Data yesterday showed manufacturing in the euro area shrank
for a fifth month in June while a preliminary survey showed
output in  China  may contract for an eighth month. Moody’s
Investors Service downgraded 15 global banks, adding to concern
that  Europe ’s fiscal woes are hurting global growth.  Spot silver gained as much as 0.7 percent to $27.0863 an
ounce before trading at $26.94. The metal used mainly in
industrial applications tumbled 4.5 percent yesterday, the most
since February and is 6.1 percent lower this week.  Cash platinum fell for a fourth day, dropping as much as
0.7 percent to $1,429.50 an ounce and was last at $1,430.

percent to $606 an ounce, before trading at $606.  To contact the reporter on this story:
