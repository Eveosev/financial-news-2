The European Parliament may next
take up proposals to regulate credit-rating companies in
September, said  Leonardo Domenici , the lawmaker leading work on
the rules.  The parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee
yesterday approved legislation that scales back measures
proposed by the European Commission. Lawmakers on the panel
voted to scrap most of a proposed requirement for businesses to
rotate the companies they hire to assess their debt, while
backing tighter restrictions on sovereign-debt ratings.  The parliament and national governments must now begin
discussions on a final compromise bill before the legislation
can become law. The issue may come up at a plenary vote in
September, Domenici told journalists today in Brussels. Work on
the plans will probably slow down as the EU’s six-month rotating
presidency moves from  Denmark  to Cyprus, he said.  In addition to the compromise on rotation requirements,
which would be limited to structured-finance products, the
committee’s version of the rules also would regulate the
timetable for sovereign-ratings releases and highlight the
ratings companies’ role in providing information to markets.  “These evaluations from credit-rating agencies shouldn’t
be any kind of political opinion,” Domenici said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
