Lincoln National Corp. (LNC)  led a slump
among  life insurers  after the  Federal Reserve  said it will
expand its Operation Twist program to reduce longer-term
interest rates.  Lincoln, the insurer that repaid a $950 million U.S.
bailout, fell 1.5 percent to $21.40 at 4 p.m. in New York.
 MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life insurer, reversed gains
after the Fed announcement, sliding 5 cents to $30.83.  The central bank will expand its program to replace short-
term bonds with longer-term debt by $267 billion through the end
of the year in a bid to lower unemployment and protect the
economic expansion, according to a statement today. The program
will “put downward pressure” on interest rates of longer-term
debt, the Federal Open Market Committee said in the statement.  “Life insurers are adversely affected by low interest
rates, in part, because of lower returns on their investments
and previous guarantees promised to the policyholders,” John
Fenton, senior life insurance consultant at  Towers Watson & Co. (TW) ,
said in an e-mailed statement before the Fed announcement.  MetLife has slipped 1.1 percent this year. Radnor,
Pennsylvania-based Lincoln advanced 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
