A unit of Volkswagen AG-controlled
 MAN SE (MAN)  has won a contract to build a diesel- and steam-driven
power station in  Kenya  with a capacity of almost 95 megawatts.  MAN Diesel & Turbo is building the plant in Thika, about 41
kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Nairobi, at a cost of “tens
of millions of euros,” the Munich-based company said today in a
 statement  on its website. The turnkey project is for Thika Power
Ltd., a unit of Lebanon’s Matelec Group, while power will be
supplied to  Kenya Power Ltd. (KPLL)  for the national grid from 2013.  Diesel engines will be able to generate 88 megawatts and
waste heat from the machines will power a steam turbine to
produce a further 6.8 megwatts, MAN Diesel said. “The African
continent offers huge potential for our power plants,” Chief
Executive Officer  Rene Umlauft  said in the statement.  The International Finance Corp. is investing 3 billion
shillings ($36 million) in Thika Power as part of Kenya’s plan
to lure private investment to the industry and reduce reliance
on weather-dependent hydroelectricity, it said on June 8.  Power shortages have hurt growth in East Africa’s largest
economy by an estimated 2 percent annually, according to the
IFC, the Washington-based  World Bank ’s private lending arm.  The gap in funding for African infrastructure projects is
$35 billion annually, with the region’s energy industry facing
the biggest shortfalls, according to the World Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
