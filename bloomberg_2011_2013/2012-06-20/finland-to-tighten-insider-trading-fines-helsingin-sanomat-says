Finland’s government proposed
increasing fines on violations of the  securities law  as part of
a legislative overhaul to be approved by parliament as of
September,  Helsingin Sanomat  reported.  Maximum fines on infractions like  insider trading  are set
to become ten-times higher than currently, rising to as much as
100,000 euros for private individuals and as much as 10 million
euros ($12.7 million) for companies, the Helsinki-based
newspaper said today, citing Finance Ministry official Janne
Haeyrynen and Jarmo Parkkinen from the country’s Financial
Supervisory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
