Sudanese police fired tear gas and
warning shots to disperse about 200 students from the  Sudan 
Banking Academy, as protests against government austerity
measures entered their fourth day in Khartoum, the capital.  “Khartoum rise up rise up, we won’t be ruled by a thief,”
chanted the protestors, some of whom threw rocks at riot police.  “We’re here to protest the price hikes, the removal of
fuel subsidies and the rise in transportation fares,” Ahmed
Mahmoud, a third-year student at the banking school, said during
the demonstration. “We’re fed up with this government. Enough,
they should go.”  Sudan’s parliament yesterday approved austerity measures to
stabilize the economy following the loss of three-quarters of
the country’s oil production when  South Sudan  seceded in July.
The decline in income resulted in a $2.4 billion  budget deficit 
and a surge in inflation to 30.4 percent last month.  Security forces also dispersed 500 students at Khartoum
University, using tear gas and batons, Wafaa Mohamed, a second-
year medicine student, said by phone.  The measures approved include devaluing the Sudanese pound
to 4.4 a dollar from 2.7 now and cutting the size of the
national and regional governments by as much as 56 percent.
Import taxes, value-added taxes and income tax on banks will
also be raised, President Umar al-Bashir said on June 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
