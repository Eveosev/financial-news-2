Alterra Capital Holdings Ltd. (ALTE) , the
reinsurer formed by the merger of Max Capital Group Ltd. and
Harbor Point Ltd., had its outlook raised to “stable” by A.M.
Best as the ratings firm expressed confidence in management.  The outlook had been lowered to “negative” last year on

current management structure,” the ratings firm said today in a
statement on the Bermuda-based reinsurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
