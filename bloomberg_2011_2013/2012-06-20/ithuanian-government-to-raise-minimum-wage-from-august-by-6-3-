Lithuania’s government approved a
plan to raise minimum wages by 6.3 percent starting in August,
less than three months before general elections.  The minimum monthly wage will rise to 850 litai ($312) from
800 litai, the government in the capital, Vilnius, said in a
 statement  on its website today.  The  International Monetary Fund   said  June 14 it supported
“a moderate”  minimum-wage  increase in the country “to ensure
that low-income workers earn a sustainable wage.”  The Cabinet delayed its plan on the minimum paycheck, the
lowest in the Baltic region, by a month as it negotiated with
social partners including trade unions in the size of the
increase. The unions wanted wages to rise by 100 litai.  Estonia’s minimum wage is 290 euros ($368), while minimum
paychecks in  Latvia  stand at 200 lati ($365).  Lithuanians will head to the polls in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
