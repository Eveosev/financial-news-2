Brent crude’s premium to Dubai, the
main marker grade for the  Middle East  and  Asia , fell to the
lowest in 21 months.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures the
European oil’s premium, fell 30 cents to $2.10 a barrel for
August, the lowest level since September 2010, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. The
September EFS was down 23 cents at $2.35.  “The narrowing Brent-Dubai premium is a result of
continued strength in the Dubai market at a time when the
European market is taking a hit,” Eugene Lindell, a senior oil
market analyst at JBC Energy GmbH in Vienna said today in an e-
mail. “Dubai is being propped up by continued uncertainty
regarding Iranian crude exports.”  Dubai crude’s  backwardation , when the price for delivery
now is greater than that for later, fell by 20 cents. Swaps for
July were 33 cents a barrel more than September, according to
PVM. The price difference, known as a timespread, has declined
76 percent in June. A narrower backwardation typically signals
sufficient supply amid falling demand from refiners for prompt
oil.  Crude Tenders  PV Oil Corp.,  Vietnam ’s state-run oil-marketing company,
offered to sell as much as 500,000 barrels of Dai Hung crude for
loading Aug. 1 to Aug. 13, according to a tender document
obtained by Bloomberg News. Bids are due tomorrow.  Qatar International Petroleum Marketing Co., known as
Tasweeq, sold seven cargoes of Al-Shaheen crude for August,
totaling 4.2 million barrels, at premiums of $1.10 to $1.35 a
barrel more than Dubai oil, said four traders who participate in
the market, asking not to be identified because the information
is confidential. The buyers include Exxon Mobil Corp. and
 India ’s Reliance Industries Ltd., the traders said.  Oman for July delivery rose 51 cents to $94.33 barrel at
12:30 p.m. on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought all five Dubai partial cargoes
sold today, according to a survey of traders who monitor the
Platts pricing window. Shell purchased one of the 25,000-barrel
lots from Mercuria Energy Trading SA at $94.25 a barrel, and
paid $94.30 for two from BP Plc, one from Total SA and one more
from Mercuria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
