Google Inc. denied making any
unlawful use of  Rosetta Stone Inc. (RST) ’s trademarks in a filing
today in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.  Rosetta Stone , which sells software for learning foreign
languages, claims Google has sold keywords using its trademark
to rivals and counterfeiters. Some of Rosetta Stone’s trademark-
infringement claims, which had been thrown out by a federal
court in 2010, were restored by a federal appeals court in April
and returned to the trial court.  Google sells advertisers the rights to use certain words or
phrases as keywords for the paid ads, known as sponsored links,
on its search site. The links direct users to the advertisers’
websites. Advertisers bid what they will pay Google for each
click on an ad triggered by the keyword. The highest bids, among
other factors, determine whether the keywords can be used.  The software maker, based in Arlington, Virginia, has said
the keywords Google sold to other businesses include “Rosetta
Stone” and “Rosettastone.com.”  In today’s filing,  Mountain View , California-based Google
denied all of Rosetta’s Stone’s allegations and asked the court
to dismiss the complaint.  The case is Rosetta Stone Ltd. v.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , 1:09-
cv-00736, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia
(Alexandria).  To contact the reporter on this story:
