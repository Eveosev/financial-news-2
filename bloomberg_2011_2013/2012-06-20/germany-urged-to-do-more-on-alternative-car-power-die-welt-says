Germany  needs to build more
infrastructure for cars with alternative power systems, or it
will miss its target of having one million such vehicles on its
streets by 2020, according to the National Platform for Electric
Mobility,  Die Welt  reported.  The government is expected to earmark 20 million euros ($25
million) for 50 hydrogen fueling stations by 2015, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
