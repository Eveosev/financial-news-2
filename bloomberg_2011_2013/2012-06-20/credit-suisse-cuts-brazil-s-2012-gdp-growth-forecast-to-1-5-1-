Brazil ’s  economy  will expand 1.5
percent this year on slowing investment and weak industrial
production, Credit Suisse Group AG said today.  The second-largest Swiss bank reduced its 2012 growth
forecast for Latin America’s biggest economy from 2 percent,
according to a report published today. The Zurich-based lender
kept its 2013 growth forecast unchanged at 4 percent.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s  efforts  to revive economic
growth in the world’s second-biggest emerging market after China
haven’t prevented economists from lowering their growth
forecast. Policy makers cut the benchmark  interest rate  to a
record, cut taxes, increased subsidized credit and took measures
to boost loans in a bid to shield Brazil from the euro debt
crisis.  “The high global uncertainty and the low probability that
we attribute to a significant expansion of the economy in the
coming quarters justify the cut in our growth forecast,” Credit
Suisse said in the report.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini said yesterday
that record low unemployment will help fuel economic growth that
will quicken to 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2013 from a
year earlier. Growth will accelerate to a 4 percent pace in the
last quarter of 2012, he said.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said the government would be
satisfied if the economy’s expansion in 2012 exceeded last
year’s 2.7 percent growth rate, which was the second-worst
performance since 2003.  Analysts expect the economy to grow 2.3 percent this year,
according to a central bank survey published this week.  “It’s a joke,” Mantega told reporters in  Rio de Janeiro 
today when asked about Credit Suisse’s 1.5 percent 2012 growth
forecast. Brazil “will grow much more.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
