Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell for a
seventh day, the longest run of losses since April 2008, on
speculation banks have less funds to invest as they target
higher lending. The dong advanced.  The government will aim for monthly credit growth of 2
percent in the second half of this year and full-year expansion
of 12 percent to 13 percent, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told the National Assembly last week without giving
comparative numbers. Bank lending fell in the first five months
of the year, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said on a radio
broadcast last month.  “Instead of purchasing bonds, banks are focusing on
lending to reach the credit growth target,” Tran Thi Thanh Thao, a Hanoi-based analyst at MB Securities Joint-Stock Co.,
wrote in a research note yesterday.  The  yield  on the five-year securities rose one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.71 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. It has risen 26 basis
points since June 11.  The dong strengthened 0.1 percent to 20,935 per dollar as
of 2:19 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828, a level
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
