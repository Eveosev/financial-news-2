Alberta regulators ordered  Enbridge
Inc. (ENB)  to shut the Athabasca crude-oil pipeline today after a
spill at a pumping station near Elk Point, Alberta.  Enbridge started the line yesterday after isolating and
shutting the Elk Point pumping station, where a spill of about
1,450 barrels of heavy crude oil occurred, according to a
statement posted on the company’s  website .  “However, the line was again shut down the afternoon of
June 19 on the order of the Energy Resources Conservation
Board,” the company said. “Enbridge is in discussion with the
ERCB to determine the appropriate time for a restart of the
line.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
