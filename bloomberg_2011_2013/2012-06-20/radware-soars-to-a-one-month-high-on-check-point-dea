Radware Ltd. (RDWR)  surged the most in a
month in New York after the Israeli technology company said it
entered a partnership with Check Point Software Technologies
Ltd., the world’s second-largest security network maker.  Radware, the Israeli developer of security and cloud-
computing technology, added 3.7 percent to $39.63 by the close
in New York, the biggest jump since May 16. The shares  gained
for a fourth consecutive day, the longest winning streak since
Jan. 12.  Radware’s Attack Mitigation System technology will be
employed in a new line of  Check Point’s (CHKP)  DDOS Protector products
to help block attacks in faster response time, according to a
statement today distributed by PR Newswire. A DDOS attack, or
distributed denial of service attack, occurs when a website is
visited by a large number of visits causing the web address to
go off line.  DDOS attacks have become more organized, professional and
complex, and can completely interrupt legitimate business
traffic, Radware said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
