Yemen’s anti-corruption body called
for the cancellation of a contract with Dubai-based  DP World
Ltd. (DPW) , the world’s third-biggest port operator, citing
irregularities in the implementation of contractual obligations.  The Supreme National Authority for Combating Corruption
would ask the country’s cabinet to cancel the agreement with DP
World, which operates the Aden and Ma’alla ports in Yemen, state
 news agency   SABA  reported yesterday.  The committee said DP World failed to carry out an
investment plan to develop the Aden port on time, and emphasized
the need to seek compensation for the “grave damages” suffered
by the port, the news agency reported.  “DP World rejects such unfounded and misleading
accusations,” the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
“We have met all contractual commitments with respect to the
Aden port operations.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
