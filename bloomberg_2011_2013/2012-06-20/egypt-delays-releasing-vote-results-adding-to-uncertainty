Egypt  will delay releasing results
of the presidential runoff that were due to be announced
tomorrow, injecting fresh uncertainty into an election claimed
by both candidates.  The elections commission decided to postpone announcing the
outcome of the first presidential elections since last year’s
ouster of  Hosni Mubarak  because it needs more time to review
appeals submitted by Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Mursi
and by Ahmed Shafik, Mubarak’s last premier, the state-run
Middle East  News Agency  reported. No new date has been
announced, the agency said.  The delay further complicates the race between the two most
divisive candidates that emerged from a field of 13 hopefuls in
the election’s first round last month.  Earlier today, Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Mahmoud Ghozlan
said Mursi has a comfortable lead and more unrest may be sparked
if Shafik, associated with the old regime, is declared the
winner. “The people will not accept” this, he said.  The commission said it has received more than 400
complaints from the two candidates charging irregularities,
according to MENA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
