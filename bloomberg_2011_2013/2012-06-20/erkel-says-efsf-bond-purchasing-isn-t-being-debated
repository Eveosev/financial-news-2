German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that allowing the European Financial Stability Facility to
purchase bonds isn’t being debated.  “There is no concrete planning that I know about, but
there is the possibility of purchasing sovereign bonds on the
secondary market,” Merkel told reporters today in Berlin after
talks with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.  To contact the reporter on this story:
