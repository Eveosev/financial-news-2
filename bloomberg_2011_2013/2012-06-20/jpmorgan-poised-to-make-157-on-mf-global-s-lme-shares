JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, is poised to more than double the value of its
investment in London Metal Exchange shares bought seven months
ago from the U.K. unit of bankrupt  MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)   JPMorgan is the biggest investor in the LME, with 1.4
million shares valued at 150.6 million pounds ($236.8 million)
after  Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. agreed to buy the
London bourse at 107.60 pounds a share. The New York-based bank
increased its stake in November when it agreed to buy 600,000
shares from MF Global U.K. Ltd. at 41.92 pounds apiece.  “To say the price is very full and very generous to LME
shareholders is an understatement,” said Peter Lenardos, an
analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “The capital gain for
them is massive. It’s an outstanding investment.”  Hong Kong Exchanges, which owns the fifth-largest equity
market by market capitalization, offered 1.39 billion pounds on
June 15 for the LME, which handled a record $15.4 trillion of
contracts last year. The takeover would give the Asian exchange
its first commodities business and the London bourse better
access to  China , the biggest user of everything from aluminum to
zinc. LME shareholders will vote on the bid by the end of July.  MF Global, based in  New York , filed the eighth-largest U.S.
bankruptcy on Oct. 31 with debt of almost $40 billion after
making wrong-way bets on sovereign debt. The 41.92 pounds paid
by JPMorgan for MF Global’s shares compared with a previous sale
of LME stock at 4.925 pounds in July. The 135-year-old LME had
said in September it received “several expressions of
interest” for the exchange.  ‘Final Offers’  “While a condition on a price adjustment for any
subsequent sale of the shares at a higher price was part of the
sale negotiations, none of the nine parties who made final
offers were prepared to agree to this condition,” Mike Pink,
joint special administrator of MF Global U.K. at KPMG LLP, said
in an e-mailed statement.  Kate Haywood , a London-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  raised its stake in the LME by
330,000 shares to 1.23 million in the year through September,
according to U.K. Companies House filings. Lehman Brothers
International Europe, the bankrupt London unit of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., transferred its 330,000 LME shares on
July 1, according to Companies House. Goldman has never said
whether it acquired those shares.  Metdist Trading  Goldman’s total stake is valued at 132.3 million pounds
under the terms of Hong Kong Exchanges’ offer. Joanna Carss, a
spokeswoman for Goldman in London, declined to comment.  Metdist Ltd. and Metdist Trading Ltd., U.K. metals trading
companies owned by the Bagri family, have a combined 1.21
million LME shares, making the group the third-largest
shareholder. Its stake is valued at 130.4 million pounds, or
about 165 times Metdist Ltd.’s profit in 2011. The company’s
fiscal year ended March 31.  Raj Bagri, who was chairman of the LME from 1993 to 2002,
is a director of Metdist Ltd. and Metdist Trading Ltd.,
according to  Companies House  filings in 2011. His son Apurv
Bagri is also named as a director of the two companies.  Sucden Financial Ltd. with 362,000 shares, would make about
39 million pounds if it sold its stake. The broker’s profit in
2011 was 9.04 million pounds on operating profit of 10.9 million
pounds, according to a Companies House filing.  Triland Metals Ltd., which has 300,000 shares, would gain
32.3 million pounds on the sale of the LME. The broker’s profit
for 2011 was 9.68 million pounds, compared with 12.9 million
pounds the year before. Its fiscal year ended March 31,
according to Companies House.  LME Shares  The LME issues two share classes. There are 12.9 million
ordinary shares conferring ownership and voting rights.
JPMorgan, Metdist Trading, Sucden Financial and Triland Metals
are category 1 members of the bourse, giving them the right to
trade on the floor of the exchange. Goldman is a category 2
member, which means it can’t participate in the so-called ring,
home to  London ’s last open-outcry trading.  The takeover needs the approval of the U.K. Financial
Services Authority as well as LME shareholders. It doesn’t need
shareholder consent in Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
