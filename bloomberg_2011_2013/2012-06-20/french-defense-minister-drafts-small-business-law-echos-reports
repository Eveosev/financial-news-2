French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le
Drian said he is drafting a small-business law for the armaments
and defense industry,  Les Echos  reported today citing an
interview.  Le Drian also said he supports the creation of a “golden
share,” or a veto right for the state, in French defense
industries, the newspaper said.  The minister added that the state would go ahead with a 1
billion-euro ($1.3 billion) contract for  Thales SA (HO)  to replace
the army’s radios after the previous administration’s  Finance
Ministry  opposed it, the news paper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
