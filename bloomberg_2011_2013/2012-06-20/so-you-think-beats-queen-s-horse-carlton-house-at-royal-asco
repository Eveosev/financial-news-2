So You Think won today’s Prince of
 Wales ’s Stakes at Royal Ascot, beating Queen Elizabeth II’s
horse Carlton House into second place.  The 4-5 favorite, a six-year-old trained in Ireland by
Aidan O’Brien and ridden by his son Joseph, saw off Carlton
House’s challenge to win by more than two lengths. The 1 1/4-
mile race carried a top prize of 284,000 pounds ($447,000).
Carlton House was a 7-2 chance, while Farhh (6-1) came third.  The 150th anniversary of the race was the feature event on
the second day of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting, where the
Queen was among the spectators as she celebrates her diamond
jubilee year.  Australian import So You Think was upset by Rewilding when
coming second as the 4-11 favorite in the race a year ago.
Today’s was his 10th victory in Group One events, the highest
category.  Royal Ascot, held in Berkshire west of  London , is Britain’s
richest race meeting, with prize money of 4.5 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
