The Hornets traded Emeka Okafor and
Trevor Ariza to the  Washington Wizards  in exchange for  Rashard Lewis , opening space on the  New Orleans  roster for possible No.
1 draft pick  Anthony Davis .  New Orleans also received the 46th pick in next week’s
 National Basketball Association  draft, the team said in an e-
mailed news release.  “We’re rebuilding our team and this is one step in our new
direction,” Hornets General Manager Dell Demps said in a
statement. “This trade will provide an opportunity for our
young players to develop and create flexibility to add to our
core group.”  The Hornets are planning to waive Lewis, a forward, before
July 1 to avoid paying roughly $10 million of the $24 million he
is owed in 2012-13, ESPN reported, citing unidentified people
close to the process. A two-time All-Star, 32-year-old Lewis has
averaged 16.1 points and 5.6 rebounds per game in 14 NBA seasons.  The moves clear space on the Hornets roster for Davis, a
forward projected by analysts to be the top pick in the draft
after being named the Associated Press men’s college basketball
Player of the Year in March.  The Hornets finished the lockout-shortened season with a
21-45 record, the lowest win total in the Western Conference.
They won the draft lottery on May 30 and will pick first at the
June 28 event.  Ariza, a 26-year-old forward, started all 116 games he
played for the Hornets, averaging 10.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and
2.6 assists over two years. The 29-year-old Okafor, a center,
has averaged 12.7 points and 10.1 rebounds during in his eight-
year career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
