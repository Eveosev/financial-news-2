Spanish exports  declined in April
for the first time in more than two years, deepening a recession
in the euro area’s fourth-largest economy.  The value of Spanish goods and services sold abroad dropped
0.8 percent in April from a year earlier, after rising 1.2
percent in March, the Economy Ministry in Madrid said in an e-
mailed statement. That’s the first drop since November 2009.  “This is very bad news for Spain as exports are the only
driver left to its economy and they are not even strong enough
to generate growth as it is,” Jesus Castillo, an economist at
Natixis in Paris, said in a telephone interview. “It’s not good
for  Europe  either, even Germany can start to worry about its
partnering economies’ slowing down.”  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  rose to a euro-
era record of 7.29 percent on June 18 after the country
requested a bailout for its banks. Investors doubt the
government can tackle a  budget deficit  similar to that of Greece
with close to a quarter of its work force unemployed.  Spanish sales were hurt by weaker demand from other
European Union countries. Exports to  France , Spain’s largest
trading partner with a share of 17.8 percent, fell 0.9 percent,
while those to the U.K. declined 9.5 percent, the ministry said.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government, in power since
December, forecasts an economic contraction of 1.7 percent this
year as austerity measures help to push domestic demand down 4.4
percent, more than twice last year’s rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
