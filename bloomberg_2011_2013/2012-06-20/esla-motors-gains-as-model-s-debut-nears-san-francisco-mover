Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  rose for a fourth
straight day, its longest streak since February, as the maker of
electric cars prepares to begin delivering Model S sedans and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its price target for the shares.  The  stock  gained 5.3 percent to $33.78 at close in New
York. Goldman Sachs today set a six-month  target  of $50, up from
$36, for the  Palo Alto , California-based company’s shares. Tesla
has climbed 18 percent this year.  “We see significant positive catalysts ahead,”  Patrick Archambault , a Goldman Sachs analyst in New York who recommends
buying Tesla shares, said in a report. He said the Model S, the
Model X sport-utility vehicle planned for 2013 and Tesla’s next-
generation model could push the company’s annual production to
more than 90,000 vehicles by 2017.  Tesla, led by PayPal Inc. co-founder  Elon Musk , has said
deliveries to consumers will start June 22 for the Model S, its
first vehicle to be designed and built in-house. The sedan has a
range of as far as 300 miles (483 kilometers) per charge and a
base price of $57,400, half that of Tesla’s Roadster, a battery-
electric sports car made under contract with Group Lotus Plc
that debuted in 2008. Roadster sales ended earlier this year.  The Model S is being built at Tesla’s Fremont, California,
plant, which previously was a joint venture owned by Toyota
Motor Corp. and the predecessor of General Motors Co. Toyota,
Daimler AG and Panasonic Corp. are  investors  in Tesla.  To contact the reporter on this story:
