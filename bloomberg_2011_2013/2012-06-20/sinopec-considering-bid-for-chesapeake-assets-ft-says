Sinopec, the Chinese oil and
natural-gas company, is weighing spending billions of dollars
for  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  assets, the Financial Times
reported.  Fu Chengyu, chairman of Sinopec, was in Oklahoma this week
as the company performs a due diligence review of Chesapeake
assets, the newspaper said today, citing unidentified people
familiar with the move.  Buying assets rather than the Oklahoma City-based company
itself may reduce the sort of political backlash that derailed
 Cnooc Ltd. (883) â€™s $18.5 billion bid for Unocal Corp., the paper said.  Chengyu said on May 11 that  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (600028)  has held talks with Chesapeake and other North American
shale-gas holders about investing as it seeks to diversify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
