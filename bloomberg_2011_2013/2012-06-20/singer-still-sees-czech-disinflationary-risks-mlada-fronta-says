Czech central bank Governor Miroslav
Singer reiterated he sees prevailing anti-inflationary risks in
the economy,  Mlada Fronta Dnes  reported, citing an interview.  Singer and Vice Governor  Vladimir Tomsik  sought a quarter-
point cut in borrowing costs at the last monetary meeting on May
3, while four board members voted to keep the main rate at a
record-low 0.75 percent and one policy maker voted for a
quarter-point increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
