The U.S. Treasury Department said it
plans to sell preferred stock it holds in seven banks as part of
the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  The Treasury said in a statement today that it would
conduct public auctions of its stock positions in  Fidelity
Southern Corp. (LION)  of Atlanta; Firstbank Corp. of Alma, Michigan;
 First Citizens Banc Corp. (FCZA)  of Sandusky, Ohio;  MetroCorp
Bancshares Inc. (MCBI)  of Houston;  Peoples Bancorp of North Carolina
Inc. (PEBK)  of Newton,  North Carolina ; Pulaski Financial Corp. of  St.
Louis ; and  Southern First Bancshares Inc. (SFST)  of Greenville, South
Carolina.  The department said it expects to begin the auctions on or
about June 25 using a modified Dutch auction method.  Under TARP, originally approved by Congress in 2008 as a
$700 billion dollar program to rescue financial institutions,
the Treasury put cash into banks in exchange for equity stakes.
Many bailout recipients repaid TARP funds, plus interest
payments on preferred shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
