HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest
bank, hired Thomas Crystal from  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
to head high-yield bond and loan sales in the U.S.  Crystal is based in New York and reports to Cary Goodwin,
head of U.S. credit sales, according to an e-mailed statement
from the bank today. Before joining RBS in November 2009, he
worked at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp., according to
records maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  HSBC is 14th most-active underwriter of high-yield bond
sales in the U.S. this year, from 15th place last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In 2010, it hired Keith
“Lex” Malas to co-head leveraged and acquisition finance in
 North America .  Crystal’s appointment “will allow us to continue building
upon our current success while we look to expand our presence in
the leverage finance area,” said Patrick Nolan, chief executive
officer for HSBC Global Banking and Markets in the Americas, in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
