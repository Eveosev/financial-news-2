The  New Zealand dollar  fell against
its U.S. counterpart after the  Federal Reserve  extended its
stimulus program and cut estimates for 2012 growth, reducing
demand for assets linked to growth.  The Australian dollar declined earlier as the Fed said it
would continue Operation Twist through the end of 2012 in an
effort to fuel growth in the world’s largest economy. Some
investors had speculated the central bank would engage in a
third round of asset purchases known as quantitative easing,
which may have boosted higher-yielding currencies.  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fell 0.3
percent to 79.62 U.S. cents yesterday in  New York . It fell
against all of its major counterparts except Japan’s currency,
against which it gained 0.5 percent to 63.32 yen.  The Aussie erased a loss to gain 0.1 percent to $1.0194. It
rose 0.8 percent to 81.08 yen.  The Fed expanded Operation Twist as policy makers lowered
their outlook for growth and employment. The program seeks to
lower borrowing costs by extending the average maturity of the
securities in the central bank’s portfolio.  Continuing the program “should put downward pressure on
longer-term  interest rates  and help to make broader financial
conditions more accommodative,” the  Federal Open Market
Committee  said yesterday in a statement at the end of a two-day
meeting.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of so-
called quantitative easing from December 2008 through June 2011
to stimulate growth through lower borrowing costs. The Aussie
appreciated 67 percent against the dollar during that time, and
the kiwi climbed 56 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
