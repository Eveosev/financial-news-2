U.S. stocks resumed losses as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
was too optimistic previously and the economic outlook has
changed.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index dropped 0.3 percent to
1,354.03 at 2:25 p.m. in New York after fluctuating earlier as
the Fed extended its Operation Twist program meant to reduce
long-term borrowing costs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
