The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission should propose a rule on the international reach of
Dodd-Frank Act swaps regulations instead of relying on informal
guidance that lacks an analysis of its cost on the financial
industry, two U.S. House Republican representatives said.  “We respectfully request that you do not move forward with
the non-binding ‘guidance’ and instead proceed through a formal
rule-making process and conduct the appropriate cost-benefit
analysis that the law requires,” Representatives Scott Garrett
of New Jersey and  Randy Neugebauer  of Texas said in a letter
today to CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler . The CFTC has scheduled a
meeting tomorrow to propose the guidance.  The guidance would extend Dodd-Frank oversight to overseas
branches, subsidiaries and conduits of U.S. banks including
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   “I think if we were to leave the London branches of the
U.S. banks or even the guaranteed affiliates out it would be, so
to speak, another loophole and a retreat from reform where risk
would come crashing back to our taxpayers and our Federal
Reserve,” Gensler said yesterday at a hearing held by the House
Financial Services Committee, of which Neugebauer and Garrett
are both members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
