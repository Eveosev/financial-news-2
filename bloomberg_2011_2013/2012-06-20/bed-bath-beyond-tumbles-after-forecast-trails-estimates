Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY)  fell the most
since its stock market debut after forecasting fiscal second-
quarter profit that was less than analysts’ estimated amid
slowing same-store sales.  The shares  declined  17 percent to $61.17 at the close in
 New York , for the biggest drop since the company first sold
shares in a public offering in 1992. The Union, New Jersey-based
company has gained 5.5 percent this year.  Profit per share in the quarter ending in August may be 97
cents to $1.03, the company said yesterday in a statement. The
average of 24 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was
$1.08.  Bed Bath & Beyond said comparable-store sales in the first
quarter rose 3 percent compared with 7 percent a year earlier.
Analysts  projected  a gain of 3.8 percent, the average of five
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Despite the ongoing economic challenges that are
affecting consumers, our fundamental business strategy remains
unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at
everyday low prices with superior  customer service ,” Chief
Executive Officer Steven Temares said during a conference call
yesterday.  In May, Bed Bath & Beyond agreed to buy  Cost Plus Inc. (CPWM)  for
$495 million in cash to add its World Market and Cost Plus
Imports chains. The deal would give Bed Bath & Beyond 295 new
stores along with another e-commerce platform to help it compete
with retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. and  Target Corp. (TGT)   Bed Bath & Beyond had 1,180 stores as of May 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
