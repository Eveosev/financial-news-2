NetApp Inc. (NTAP)  said it complied with a
U.S. request for information related to reports it sold storage
technology underpinning an Internet-surveillance system being
built last year for  Syria .  “We have met with U.S. government officials, provided
information at their request, and expressed our willingness to
continue cooperating with any further inquiry or
investigation,” the Sunnyvale, California-based maker of
computer storage systems said in its annual report, filed
yesterday after the close of regular trading.  The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and
Security started an investigation of NetApp’s role in the Syrian
system after Bloomberg reported on the project in November.
Eugene Cottilli, a bureau spokesman, said last month that the
investigation was continuing. He didn’t respond today to e-mail
and phone requests for comment.  NetApp has  condemned  any potential use of its equipment in
Syria and is conducting an internal review, the company said in
its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Jodi Baumann, a NetApp spokeswoman, didn’t respond
to e-mail and phone requests today for comment.  The Italian company Area SpA, which spearheaded the
development of the surveillance project, bought the NetApp gear
from an Italian distributor and exported it to Syria, Bloomberg
reported in November. Area has since cancelled the project.  To contact the reporters on this story:
