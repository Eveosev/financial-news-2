LCH Clearnet Ltd.,  Europe ’s biggest
clearing house, raised the extra deposit it demands from clients
to trade some Italian government bonds, a day after increasing
charges for most Spanish bonds.  The margin needed for Italian securities due in seven years
to 10 years will be increased to 9.5 percent from 8.3 percent,
according to a  statement  on LCH Clearnet’s website today. The
rate was boosted on all Italian debt due from two years through
15 years, the statement showed.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  is implementing spending
cuts and measures to spur growth as he seeks to reduce Europe’s
second-biggest debt burden and avoid becoming the fifth euro-
bloc nation to request international aid.  Spain  will receive
funds for its banks that may reach 100 billion euros ($127
billion), following rescues for  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal .  The margin needed for Spanish securities due in 10 years to
15 years will be increased to 14.7 percent from 13.6 percent,
according to a statement on  LCH Clearnet’s website  yesterday.
The rate on Italian securities of similar maturity was set at 12
percent, from 11.45 percent, the company said today.  Bond Yields  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond rose to 6.34 percent on
June 14, the highest since Jan. 20. It fell 15 basis points
today to 5.77 percent. Spain’s equivalent-maturity bond  yield 
climbed to a euro-lifetime high of 7.29 percent two days ago,
sliding to 6.74 percent today.  An increase in the margin requirement reduces the amount of
cash banks are able to borrow using the  government bonds  as
collateral in so-called repurchase operations, dimming their
appeal, and meaning holders need to commit more of the
securities to get the same size of loans.  The changes for Italy and Spain will come into effect from
the close of business tomorrow, LCH Clearnet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
