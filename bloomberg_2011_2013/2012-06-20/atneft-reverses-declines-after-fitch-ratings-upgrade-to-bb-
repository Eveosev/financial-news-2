OAO  Tatneft (TATN)  jumped, reversing a
loss, after Fitch Ratings raised the Russian oil producer’s
rating.  Tatneft added 0.5 percent to 186.17 rubles by 3:15 p.m. in
Moscow, heading for the highest level since April 10.  Fitch raised Tatneft to BB+, its highest non-investment
level, from BB, citing progress in construction of the Taneco
refinery, “conservative” spending and “expected gradual
deleveraging,” in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporters on this story:
