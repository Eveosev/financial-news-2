U.K. jobless claims unexpectedly
rose in May, suggesting the labor market may be starting to
succumb to Europe’s intensifying debt crisis.  Jobless-benefit claims climbed 8,100 from April, the  Office
for National Statistics  said today in London. The median
forecast of 20 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
drop of 4,000. The  unemployment rate  as measured by
International Labour Organization methods was unchanged at 8.2
percent.  “Looking ahead much depends on the euro zone crisis and
the effect this exerts on the U.K. economy,”  Philip Shaw , an
economist at Investec Securities in London, said before the
report. “The message is the economy is not growing, perhaps
contracting.”  The figures suggest the labor-market recovery is running
out of steam, increasing pressure on Prime Minister  David
Cameron . His budget cuts have been blamed by the opposition
 Labour Party  for pushing the U.K. into its first double-dip
recession since the 1970s at a time when the euro crisis is
casting a shadow on prospects for the economy.  In the three months through April, ILO unemployment fell
51,000 to 2.62 million people. In April, jobless claims fell
12,800 rather than the previously estimated 13,700 drop.  Employment rose 166,000 to 29.3 million, the biggest
increase since June-August 2010 with gains in full-time and
part-time work.  In the first quarter, public sector employment fell by
39,000 to 5.9 million, while employment in the private sector
increase by 205,000 to 23.4 million, the statistics office said.  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  last week unveiled
measures to fight the escalating euro-area crisis as he warned
of a “black cloud” from Europe that may hurt Britain’s
economy.  The U.K.’s jobless rate compares with 8.2 percent in the
U.S., though it is well below the 11 percent in the euro region,
where property busts in Spain and Ireland shattered the labor-
intensive house-building industry.  It is also below the peaks reached after recessions in the
early 1980s and early 1990s, when unemployment climbed above 10
percent. That suggests firms have hoarded workers, leaving scope
for a renewed round of job shedding if the recovery proves
weaker than anticipated.  Annual pay growth quickened to 1.4 percent in the three
months through April from 0.9 percent in the three previous
months, today’s figures showed. Pay growth less bonuses
accelerated to 1.8 percent from 1.6. Inflation slowed to 2.8
percent in April, data showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
