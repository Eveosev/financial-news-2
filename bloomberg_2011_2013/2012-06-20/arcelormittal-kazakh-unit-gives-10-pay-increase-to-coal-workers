ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s Kazakh unit gave a
10 percent pay gain to coal workers, including 7.4 percent to
compensate for inflation, after rejecting higher demands.  The increase is effective from the start of 2012, and wage
talks will resume in October, AO ArcelorMittal Temirtau said in
an e-mailed statement today. Steel and coal unions have since
November sought 30 percent higher wages, on top of an inflation
adjustment, said Roman Ilto, a Temirtau-based spokesman for the
company. It failed to agree to a pay deal with steel workers.  Unions representing ArcelorMittal Temirtau’s 35,300 staff
declined an offer in February to adjust wages for inflation and
discuss other increases after a sales target for rolled steel
was reached, the unit of the world’s biggest steelmaker said on
Feb. 28. Demands for salary increases by oil workers in western
 Kazakhstan  triggered strikes and violence last year, leading to
the death of 16 people after police used arms to suppress unrest
in Zhanaozen during Independence Day celebrations on Dec. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
