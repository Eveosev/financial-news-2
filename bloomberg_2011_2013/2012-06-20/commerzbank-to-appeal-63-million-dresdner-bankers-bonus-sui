Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-
largest lender, said it appealed a court ruling forcing it to
pay about 50 million euros ($63.5 million) in bonuses to more
than 100 Dresdner Kleinwort bankers.  The bank asked the U.K. Court of Appeal to overturn the May
9 decision by Judge Robert Owen that said the bank broke its
pledge to pay its former workers their full bonuses.  Commerzbank, which took over Dresdner in January 2009, was
accused by 104 bankers of breaking a promise by then-Dresdner
Chief Executive Officer Stefan Jentzsch the previous year, when
he said there would be a guaranteed 400 million euros for
bonuses.  “We strongly disagree with the decision of the U.K. high
court,” Andrew Walton, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based
Commerzbank, said in a statement. “It was reasonable and
responsible to reduce the bonuses in the light of the 6.5
billion-euro loss that Dresdner’s investment-banking operation
posted for 2008.”  Commerzbank said at a January trial that it was entitled to
cut bonus payouts by more than 90 percent for bankers including
Desmond McNamara, former head of risk management at Dresdner’s
capital-markets division, because of the record losses at the
investment banking unit.  “We note Commerzbank has now sought permission to appeal;
we do not consider that their grounds for appeal have any
merit,” Andrew Shaw, a lawyer at Stewarts Law LLP representing
the former Dresdner bankers, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
