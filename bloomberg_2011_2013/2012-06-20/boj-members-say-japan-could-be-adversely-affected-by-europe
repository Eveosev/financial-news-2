Bank of Japan  board members said the
central bank has been pursuing “powerful monetary easing” and
a few said  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis could hurt  Japan ’s
economy, a record of last month’s gathering showed.  Board members agreed that it was appropriate to monitor the
effects of the BOJ’s asset purchases, which were expanded at the
the previous meeting in April, according to the minutes of the
May 22-23 meeting released in  Tokyo  today. One member warned
that the risk of automatically adding stimulus could affect the
stability of the economy and prices.  The meeting was held prior to the second Greek election and
a few members expressed concern that Japan’s economy could be
“adversely affected” by the materialization of “substantial
risk” stemming from the European crisis. These members said
“the bank should stand ready to take appropriate actions
without ruling out any option in advance.”  Since the election, Europe’s woes have shown no signs of
abating, with Spanish  10-year bond yields  rising above 7 percent
this week.  Some members said that attention needed to be paid to the
risk of an abrupt jump in long-term interest rates, and members
shared the view that it is “extremely important that the
credibility of fiscal sustainability in financial markets be
maintained,” the minutes showed.  One member expressed concern over the impact of the recent
appreciation of the yen and a fall in stock prices and was
worried about the effect of this on  capital investment ,
according to the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
