OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s biggest miner
of steelmaking coal, said first-quarter profit fell 29 percent
as coal prices dropped and mines were halted for safety checks.  Net income declined to $218 million from $309 million a
year earlier, Mechel said today in a statement. That beat the
$125 million median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 0.5 percent to $2.95 billion.  Coal prices have retreated as  China ’s growth slows, eroding
demand in the world’s biggest user of the steelmaking material.
Coal India Ltd., the largest producer, reported a 5 percent
decline in profit last month. Moscow-based Mechel also suspended
production at two sites in December amid safety concerns.  Mechel dropped as much as 2.4 percent in Moscow trading,
the biggest intraday decline in a week. The stock was down 1.9
percent at 204.60 rubles as of 12:16 p.m. local time.  The company is studying asset disposals as it seeks to
reduce debt, which totaled $9.6 billion at the end of March.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization were $463 million in the first quarter, exceeding
the $458 million analyst estimate. Losses at the ferroalloys
division widened to $56 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
