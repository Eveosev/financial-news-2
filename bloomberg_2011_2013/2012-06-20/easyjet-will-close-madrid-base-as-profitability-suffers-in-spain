EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest
discount airline, will stop basing crew and aircraft in  Madrid 
starting this winter as overcapacity and high airport charges in
 Spain  curb profitability.  Profit from EasyJet’s Madrid operations is below that at
its other bases, the company said today in a statement. “This
is due to a combination of overcapacity in the Spanish airline
market, leading to low revenue per passenger, combined with high
airport charges which have more than doubled in the last two
years,” Luton, England-based EasyJet said.  Spain’s government is battling to reduce its debt as the
recession deepens, pushing unemployment above 24 percent.
Barcelona-based Spanair SA in January became the first scheduled
European carrier to fold since the last recession as the
European Union’s highest jobless rate clipped traffic and the
Catalonia government said it would no longer supply funds.  Easyjet will reduce capacity to Madrid by about 20 percent
in the next financial year and to Spain as a whole by 7 percent.
Total capacity will increase by about 5 percent in the 12 months
ending Sept. 30.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) ’s Spanish unit
Iberia started a lower-cost division in March in an effort to
stem losses on short-haul trips. Iberia posted a 170 million-
euro ($216 million) loss in the first quarter.  Should they remain at current levels, this year’s lower
fuel prices will offset any restructuring costs, EasyJet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
