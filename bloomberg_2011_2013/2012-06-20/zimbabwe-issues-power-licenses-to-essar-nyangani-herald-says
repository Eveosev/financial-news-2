The Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory
Authority has issued licenses to Essar Africa Holdings, China
Africa Sunlight (Pvt) Ltd. and Nyangani Renewable, the state-
controlled  Herald reported , citing ZERA Chief Executive Officer
Gloria Magombo.  Essar Africa plans a 600-megawatt power plant that will be
commissioned in 2016, the Harare-based newspaper reported. China
Africa will build a 120-megawatt generator by 2014, while
Nyanganiâ€™s 3.8-megawatt plant may begin operations in 2013, the
Herald said.  Zimbabwe has issued 16 licenses to generate electricity
since 2010, it reported. If built, the 16 license-holders would
generate a combined 5,000 megawatts of power, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
