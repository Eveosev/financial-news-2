Red Hat Inc. (RHT) , the largest seller of
the open-source Linux operating system, fell the most in six
months after reporting first-quarter billings that missed some
analysts’ estimates.  The shares of Raleigh, North Carolina-based Red Hat
declined 6.2 percent to $53 at the close in  New York , the
steepest drop since Dec. 20. The company also gave a second-
quarter revenue forecast that trailed the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Billings, a predictor of revenue, were $310 million in the
quarter ended May 31, falling short of the $319 million average
analyst estimate, said  Abhey Lamba , an analyst at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc. Billings increased 16 percent from a year
earlier, while analysts predicted 20 percent growth on average,
according to Morgan Stanley.  “My feeling is it’s related to currency and a weakening
macro-economy,” said Lamba, who recommends buying the shares.  First-quarter billings also increased at a slower rate
compared with the previous quarter, which posted a 31 percent
increase.  Investor concerns about billings overshadowed first-quarter
earnings. Red Hat posted profit of 30 cents a share, excluding
some items, exceeding the 27-cent average estimate  compiled  by
Bloomberg. Revenue increased 19 percent to $314.7 million, the
company said in a statement yesterday. Analysts anticipated
$310.8 million.  Net income rose 15 percent to $37.5 million, or 19 cents a
share, from $32.5 million, or 17 cents a year ago.  For the second quarter, the company said profit will be 28
cents to 29 cents a share. The top end matched the average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales will be $320 million to
$322 million, Chief Financial Officer Charles Peters said on a
conference call yesterday. That trailed the $330.9 million
average prediction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
