France ’s government will need to
find 10 billion euros ($12.7 billion) such as through new tax
receipts to meet the 2012 budget, French Minister Alain Vidalies
told  Agence France-Presse .  “The fact that we have 10 billion euros missing at the end
of June isn’t the responsibility of this government that has
started working May 16,” Vidalies, the Minister for Relations
with the Parliament, said in an interview with AFP, Le Monde
daily and La Chaine Parlementaire today.  Vidalies said President Francois Hollande’s government,
which is due to unveil a revised budget law next month, will
seek to compensate the missing funds by scrapping tax breaks for
tax payers, ending a tax holiday on labor charges and raising
taxes for the wealthy people, AFP said.  Vidalies said the former government of  Nicolas Sarkozy  is
responsible for the missing 10 billion euros. He said the French
State Auditor will unveil a review of French public accounts at
the end of the month and that it may confirm the report, AFP
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
