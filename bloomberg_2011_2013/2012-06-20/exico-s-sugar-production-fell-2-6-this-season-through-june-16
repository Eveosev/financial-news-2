Sugar output in  Mexico , the world’s
sixth-largest producer, is down 2.6 percent so far this season,
according to industry committee Conadesuca.  Production in the 2011-12 season, which started in October,
totaled 5.04 million metric tons through June 16, Conadesuca
said in a  report  on its website yesterday. That compares with
5.18 million tons a year earlier.  Mexico will produce 5.04 million tons of sugar this season,
down from a previous forecast of 5.1 million tons, Conadesuca
estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
