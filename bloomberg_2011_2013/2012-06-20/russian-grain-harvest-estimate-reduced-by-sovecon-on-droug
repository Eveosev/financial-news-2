Russia ’s grain output estimate for
the marketing year that starts July 1 was cut, due to drought,
to a maximum of 85 million metric tons, including up to 50
million to 51 million tons of wheat, SovEcon said.  That’s down from SovEcon’s previous estimate of 87 million
to 90 million tons of grain, including 53 million tons of wheat,
Andrei Sizov Jr., the agricultural consultancy’s managing
director, said by phone in Moscow today.  Winter crop loss for large agricultural companies came in
higher than expected at about 11 percent, according to the state
statistics data in June. That also led SovEcon to lower its
forecast, Sizov said.  In Krasnodar, Russia’s biggest wheat exporting region,
about 15 percent of winter crops were lost, up from the multi-
year average of 1 percent to 2 percent, Sizov said.
Drought continues in the south, and many regions started
harvesting grains two weeks earlier than normal to collect seeds
before they fall off, Sizov said.  “In some regions, like Volgograd in the south, the grain
is light in weight, which means yields will be smaller than a
year earlier,” he said.  Russia’s grain exports are expected to be less than 18
million tons in the new season and wheat exports are seen coming
in under 14 million tons, Sizov said.  Last year, Russia’s grain crop was 94 million tons,
including 56 million tons of wheat, according to the state
statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
