Researchers will present the results
of two late-stage studies on  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  and  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s
experimental drug for Alzheimer’s disease, bapineuzumab, at the
American Neurological Association meeting in early October.  The findings of the two studies will be presented in  Boston 
on Oct. 8 in a session dedicated to immune-based treatments for
neurological disorders, according to the meeting program posted
on the neurological association’s  website . The results, if
positive, could lead the companies to file for U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approval of the medicine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
