Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM) , Turkey’s
largest landline telephone company, rose the most in more than
four months after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  upgraded the stock to
buy from neutral.  Turk Telekom added 3.7 percent to 6.74 liras at the close
in Istanbul trading, the biggest gain since Feb. 1.  “Further news on tariff dynamics in Turkey as well as the
growth of the wireless market should revitalize investor
interest in the stock and support a re-rating,” Goldman Sachs
said in an e-mailed report today. “We expect it to achieve the
fastest growth among central and eastern Europe, Middle East and
Africa fixed-line incumbents.”  The 12-month price estimate is 8.05 liras, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
