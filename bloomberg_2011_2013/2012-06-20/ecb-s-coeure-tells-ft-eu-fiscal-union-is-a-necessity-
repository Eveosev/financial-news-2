European Central Bank executive
board member Benoit Coeure sees increased economic integration
in the European Union as an essential step toward stability, the
Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  Coeure, who is responsible for the ECB’s market operations,
told the FT that his answer to people who are in doubt about
“the necessity of fiscal union” is that “if they want to keep
the euro and have the benefits that the euro has brought to
their economies, they have to make steps towards a fiscal
union.”  Europe  is in the third year of an economic crisis and
reaching a point where “deeper questions are being asked,” the
FT cited Coeure as saying. Central to those questions is the
shape of a future banking and fiscal union to bolster the
monetary union, Coeure said, according to the newspaper.  Without such strengthening, “the system will not be stable
and we will continue to experience crises,” Coeure told the FT.  Couere said a cut in the ECB’s main interest rate -- at 1
percent since December -- was “discussed at the last governing
council meeting,” and that he “would expect the next council
to discuss it again,” the FT reported.  While he supports using the EU’s bailout fund to intervene
in government bond markets as a stopgap measure, he is not eager
for the ECB to take on that role, saying that the Securities
Markets Program isn’t considered “the best instrument to use at
the current juncture” because it’s not advisable to “mix the
central bank with the fiscal authorities,” he told the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
