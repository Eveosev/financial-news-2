What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that a recent rally which
sent prices up 12 percent in the past three sessions may deter
overseas buyers, said  Larry Glenn , an analyst at Frontier Ag in
Quinter, Kansas.  -- Soybean futures may open down 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel in
Chicago as rising prices may curb demand, Glenn said. Soybean-
oil futures are expected to open 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent lower per
pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $2 lower per
2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange , Glenn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
