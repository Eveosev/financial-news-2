The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell to the lowest in three weeks, according
to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 49.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 10 a.m. in
 London , from minus 52 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the lowest cost since May 29 when the measure
was minus 47.  The one-year basis swap was 48 basis points below Euribor
from minus 49. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Euribor,
the rate banks say they see each other lending in euros, is
derived from a survey of  banks  by the European Banking
Federation.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- were little changed at 33 basis points.  The Euribor/OIS spread was little changed at 43 basis
points. The measure reached 2 1/2-month high of 44 basis points
on June 18.  Overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based  European Central
Bank  were little changed at 764 billion euros ($970 billion)
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
