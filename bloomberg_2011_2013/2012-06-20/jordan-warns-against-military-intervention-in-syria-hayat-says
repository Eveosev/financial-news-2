Jordan’s King Abdullah said
military intervention to end Syria’s crisis would risk a “total
breakdown in regional security,”  Al Hayat  reported, citing  an
interview .  An initiative by former United Nations Secretary-General
 Kofi Annan  is still “the best way to develop” a solution to
the crisis, the London-based newspaper cited the king as saying.  Jordan, which borders Syria, has opposed suggestions that
Syrian rebels fighting to end the rule of President Bashar al- Assad should be supplied with arms. Jordan’s last direct contact
with Assad was at the start of the crisis, the king said in the
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
