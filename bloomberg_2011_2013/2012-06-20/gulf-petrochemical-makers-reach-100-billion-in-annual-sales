Petrochemical makers in Arab
countries of the Persian Gulf generated about $100 billion in
sales last year as most of them added production capacity, a
regional trade association said.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the worldâ€™s biggest
petrochemicals company, and other producers increased their
combined capacity by 14 percent to more than 116 million metric
tons last year compared with 102.1 million tons in 2010, the
Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association said. Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the  United Arab Emirates  all
increased capacity, while Bahrain showed no change, the
association said in its 2011 annual report posted today on its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
