Belgian manufacturers plan to raise
 capital spending  by 17 percent this year after an estimated 10
percent increase in 2011, according to the National Bank of
 Belgium â€™s semi-annual survey.  The projected 17 percent increase is smaller than the 25
percent expansion estimated for 2012 six months ago, when
capital spending for 2011 was estimated to climb 7.5 percent,
the Brussels-based central bank said today in an e-mailed
statement. Capital spending by the manufacturing industry
accounts for about 15 percent of total investment by Belgian
companies, according to the National Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
