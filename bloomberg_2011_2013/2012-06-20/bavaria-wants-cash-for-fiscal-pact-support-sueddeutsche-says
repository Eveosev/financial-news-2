Bavaria’s state government wants
German federal cash to build a rail tunnel in Munich in exchange
for agreeing to ratify the European fiscal pact in the upper
house of parliament, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Bavarian Prime Minister
 Horst Seehofer  said the federal government should raise its
transport budget by 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) starting in
2012, helping projects that include building the Munich tunnel.  “We don’t want any extra sausage rations for Bavaria, but
if the states had 1 billion euros more that would mean 150
million euros each year for Bavaria,” Seehofer told the
newspaper.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  needs the support of  Germany ’s
states in the upper house to ratify the fiscal pact, which may
be voted on in the chamber on June 29 or July 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
