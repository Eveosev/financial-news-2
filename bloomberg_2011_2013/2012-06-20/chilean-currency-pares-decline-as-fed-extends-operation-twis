Chilean traders’ expectations for
inflation fell to the lowest level this year as a stronger peso
pushed down the local cost of oil, the country’s main import.  The one-year breakeven inflation rate fell 13 basis points,
of 0.13 percentage point to 2.57 percent. It was the biggest
drop in two months. Two-year breakeven fell seven basis points
to 2.61 percent. The forwards market for unidades de fomento,
 Chile ’s inflation-linked currency unit, indicates traders expect
prices to rise 2.22 percent this year, compared with 2.34
percent yesterday.  Chile’s central bank lowered its 2012 inflation forecast on
June 18 to 2.7 percent from 3.5 percent because of falling oil
and food prices. Oil futures declined to an eight-month low
today after the U.S. Energy Department reported crude
inventories at their highest in 22 years.  “More than anything else, inflation is following oil,”
said Felipe Alarcon, an economist at  Banco de Credito e
Inversiones. (BCI)  “Oil fell to $82 and with the lower  exchange rate 
there’s a double effect.”  Crude oil for July delivery dropped 2.7 percent to $81.75 a
barrel today in  New York . The 4.2 percent rally in the Chilean
currency this month means the price of oil has fallen 9.3
percent in peso terms since the end of May.  Chile’s peso depreciated 0.1 percent to 495.45 per  U.S.
dollar  after earlier falling as much as 0.8 percent. The peso
declined 0.6 percent in aftermarket trading to 498.13 per
dollar, according to Datatec prices.  Barclays View  Barclays Plc recommended that investors prepare for the
Chilean peso to rally against the dollar and euro as copper
prices increase on Chinese economic growth. Chile’s economy may
expand 5 percent this year, economists including Sebastian Brown
wrote in a research note.  International investors in the peso forwards market reduced
their short peso position to $10 billion on June 18 from $10.3
billion on June 15, according to central bank data. Local
investors, excluding banks and brokers, had a $16.8 billion long
peso position, the smallest since May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
