French soft-wheat exports in the
year through June will be lower than forecast a month ago on
falling shipments outside the European Union, crop office
FranceAgriMer said.  Outbound shipments of the grain will be 15.7 million metric
tons in 2011-12, less than the 15.9 million tons predicted in
May, the Montreuil-sous-Bois, France-based crop office wrote in
a report on its website.  France ’s wheat exports, the world’s second-largest after
the U.S. in the 2010-11 crop year, have declined after a spring
drought last year curbed supplies and on competition with grain
from Russia and Ukraine.  “Our performance is down from the previous year on Morocco
but especially toward  Egypt ,” FranceAgriMer wrote. “Exports
destined for third countries were revised downwards in light of
what was already loaded.”  While the outlook for soft-wheat exports to EU countries
was maintained at 7.1 million tons, the prediction for shipments
outside the bloc was cut by 200,000 tons to 8.5 million tons,
FranceAgriMer said.  The main non-EU destinations for French soft wheat this
year will be  Algeria , with 3.3 million tons, and  Morocco  with
1.5 million tons, the crop office wrote. Deliveries to Egypt,
the world’s largest wheat buyer, are forecast to slump to
400,000 tons from 2.3 million tons in 2010-11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
