Spain  may need to impose losses on
bondholders before it would be able to receive a “sizable”
bailout from international peers,  Petros Christodoulou , former
head of Greece’s debt office, said in a  BBC Radio 5 interview .  “There will be some intervention to stabilize” Spain and
Italy’s debt, Christodoulou told the radio station today. “If
there is no sufficient stabilization” Europe is moving in the
direction that “before sizable official money is poured into a
country, there has to be some sort of private-sector
involvement,” he said.  Christodoulou also said buying of government debt by
official institutions is “poisonous for the balance of the debt
because this is subordinated to the official money.”  Bondholders wrote off more than 100 billion euros ($127
billion) when Greece restructured its debt in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
