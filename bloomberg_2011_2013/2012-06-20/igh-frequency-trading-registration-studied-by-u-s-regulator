U.S. financial regulators would
waste budget resources by requiring registration and audits of
automated trading algorithms, according to an advisory group to
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Regulators would face difficulties establishing unique
attributes of algorithms, which change frequently, in order to
require registration, according to a summary of the group’s
views scheduled to be presented today at a meeting of the
technology advisory committee to the CFTC.  The agency, the main U.S. derivatives regulator, is
considering new rules to oversee automated trading systems and
high-frequency trading.  “Market abuse is not fundamentally a function of the
means, speed or frequency of order entry and transactions,”
according to the summary. “Focus should be on specific
behaviors that undermine market integrity irrespective of the
means or pace of order entry.”  The group said audits would be an ineffective use of
budgetary resources with unclear benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
