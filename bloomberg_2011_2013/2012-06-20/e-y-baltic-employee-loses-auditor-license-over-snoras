Lithuanian authorities canceled an
auditors license for an Ernst & Young Baltic UAB employee and
told the company to improve controls after reviewing his
financial reports on Bankas Snoras AB issued before the lender’s
bankruptcy.  The bank’s auditor, Ramunas Bartasius, lacked
“skepticism” and failed to gather sufficient evidence to
mitigate auditing risks to “acceptable low levels,” said the
Authority of Audit and Accounting in Vilnius in a  statement  on
its website today. Ernst & Young Baltic must improve auditing
controls by Dec. 15, it said.  Lithuania’s central bank took over Snoras, then the
country’s third-biggest bank by deposits, in November after
discovering assets reported on the lender’s balance sheet were
missing. The bank was declared bankrupt.  Ernst & Young Baltic said it rejected the authority’s
decision because the regulator reviewed the auditor’s report
after receiving additional information such as legal
investigation into suspicion of criminal activity at the bank by
its shareholders, according to an e-mailed statement from Ernst
& Young today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
