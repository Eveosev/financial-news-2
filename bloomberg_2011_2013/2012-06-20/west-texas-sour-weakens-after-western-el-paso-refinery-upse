West  Texas  Sour crude’s discount to
the U.S. benchmark grade weakened the most in eight weeks after
 Western Refining Inc. (WNR)  reported a crude unit upset at its El Paso
plant in Texas.  A feed interruption caused the upset yesterday in the
refinery’s North crude unit, which was stabilized, the company
said in a  filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality. The plant processes primarily West Texas Sour and West
Texas Intermediate crudes, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Stevens
said at a conference March 9.  West Texas Sour oil’s discount to West Texas Intermediate
widened $2.25 a barrel, the most since April 25, to $4.75 at
2:06 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mars Blend’s premium narrowed 45 cents to $8.80 a barrel.
The grade weakened a second day after  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said
yesterday it resumed production at a U.S. Gulf Coast oil
platform following planned maintenance.  Poseidon’s premium narrowed 60 cents to $7.80 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased $1.25 to $8.35.
 Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than Mars,
Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, lost 60 cents to a premium
of $11.40 a barrel over WTI.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 35 cents to $12.35 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost 35 cents to $11.50.  Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $6 a barrel below
the U.S. benchmark.  Syncrude’s discount held at $1.50 below WTI. Syncrude is
synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like bitumen in  Alberta  into
refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount was unchanged at $21.75 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
