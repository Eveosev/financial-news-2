France  may introduce a tax on large
luxury cars to help slow a drop in demand for smaller models
built in the country,  La Tribune  reported, citing a study
commissioned by elected officials of towns with auto plants.  The proposal presents the idea as intended to protect the
environment by favoring smaller, less-polluting cars, though it
may be a form of protectionism helping  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  and
 Renault SA (RNO) , as its goal is stated as “winning back 500,000
vehicles a year,” the French newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
