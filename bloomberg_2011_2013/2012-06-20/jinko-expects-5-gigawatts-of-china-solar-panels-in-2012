JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS) , a Chinese
solar manufacturer, expects installations of panels in its home
market to almost double this year to 5 gigawatts.  There will be “strong demand” in  China  in the second half
of the year, Arturo Herrero, chief marketing officer of the
Shangrao-based company, said today during a conference call to
discuss its first-quarter results.  China installed 2.57 gigawatts of solar panels last year
and is on pace to become the biggest solar market next year as
Italy and Germany, the top markets in 2011, trim government
subsides to slow demand, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  “The Chinese government is committed to reach 10 gigawatts
of installed capacity by 2015 and 50 gigawatts by 2020,”
Herrero said on the call.  JinkoSolar’s quarterly revenue was 1.1 billion  yuan  ($168.3
million), down 51 percent from a year earlier, according to a
statement today. Its net loss was 356.3 million yuan, compared
with net income of 336.6 million yuan.  The European Union probably won’t follow a U.S. preliminary
decision to impose tariffs on Chinese solar cells, Herrero said,
based on the company’s discussions within the solar industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
