Canadian natural gas declined prior
to the release of a  U.S. government report  on storage as
forecasters predicted lower temperatures that may cut demand for
the power-plant fuel.  July gas in  Alberta  fell 2.5 percent as MDA EarthSat
Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, said cooler-than-normal
weather will prevail in the Northeast from June 25 to June 29.
The Energy Department may report tomorrow that U.S. stockpiles
for the week ended June 15 increased 64 billion cubic feet,
according to  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “With tomorrow’s storage number we could see a lot of
activity around that, so there could be some hesitation ahead of
that report,” Eric Bickel, an analyst at Summit Energy Services
in Louisville,  Kentucky , said in a telephone interview.  Alberta gas for July delivery dropped 4.75 cents to C$1.89
a gigajoule ($1.76 per million British thermal units) as of 3:10
p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian internet market. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system. NGX gas
is down 27 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 2.8 cents to settle at $2.517 per million Btu.  NYC Cooler  The high for New York on June 26 may be 76 degrees
Fahrenheit (24 Celsius), 6 below normal, said AccuWeather.com of
 State College , Pennsylvania.  “The trough overhead in the Northeast will keep
temperatures generally cooler than normal as it continues to be
supported by the blocking pattern further north,” Eric Wertz,
an MDA meteorologist, wrote in a 6- to 10-day forecast today.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago rose
1.3 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.6891 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas advanced 1.43 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.317 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices gained 1.03 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.4431.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3 billion cubic
feet at 3 p.m. New York time.  Gas Flows  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.07 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.06 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 726 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.89 billion cubic feet today, or 72 percent
of normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.98
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
