The new credit-rating rules that
European Union lawmakers are debating won’t dent the industry’s
profits, according to  Peter Appert , an analyst at Piper Jaffray
& Co. in  San Francisco .  The European Parliament’s economic and monetary affairs
committee decided yesterday in Brussels to scale back a proposal
to force businesses to rotate which firms they hire to rate
their debt. That rule, along with the rest of the region’s plan
to tighten regulation of ratings, will have “minimal impact”
on profits at Moody’s Investors Service and New York-based
Standard & Poor’s, Appert wrote today in a report.  The European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s regulatory arm,
proposed the rotation as part of a draft law to toughen
regulation of the ratings industry amid concerns that some of
the companies’ decisions exacerbated the euro-area debt crisis.
Parliament and national governments must begin discussions on a
final compromise bill before the legislation can become law.  “We expect the final outcome to be very manageable in
terms of modest incremental costs and minimal disruption to the
current business model,” Appert said.  Moody’s Corp. (MCO) ’s stock has climbed 7.2 percent this year to
$36.12 at 10:20 a.m. in  New York , while McGraw-Hill Cos., the
owner of S&P, has dropped 3.4 percent to $43.44. Appert said his
target for Moody’s is $47 while McGraw-Hill may rise to $54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
