China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) , the
country’s second-biggest wireless carrier, will cut the price of
its cheapest smartphones by 30 percent to about $110 in an
effort to expand its market share as user growth slows.  China Unicom will introduce smartphones costing less than
700  yuan  in China in the near future, after “great success”
with models priced at less than 1,000 yuan ($157), President Lu
Yimin told the GSMA Mobile Asia Expo in Shanghai today.  “For the mass market we launched a series of promotions
with 1,000-renminbi smartphones” from 2010 to 2011, Lu said.
“In 2012, we will continue promotion measures.”  China Unicom declined 3.9 percent to HK$10.40 as of 1:52
p.m. in  Hong Kong  trading, poised for its biggest drop since
June 4.  Lu didn’t provide a more specific timeframe for selling the
cheaper smartphones. China Unicom currently offers handsets from
Huawei Technologies Co. and  ZTE Corp. (000063)  costing less than 1,000
yuan each.  The Beijing-based company has introduced 235 smartphones
since starting 3G service in 2009, Lu said.  The carrier added 2.73 million users to its third-
generation, or 3G, service last month, China Unicom said
yesterday. That was fewer than the 2.92 million additions in
April, and was the lowest monthly gain since September.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
