Ticket prices to sold-out events at
the London Olympics have climbed as high as 20 times face value
on the secondary market, with the opening and closing
ceremonies, the men’s basketball final and the last track-and-
field session going for at least 1,000 pounds ($1,576) a seat.  The games start July 27 and tickets to the opening ceremony
are the most expensive and most scarce, according to  TiqIQ , an
aggregator of the online resale ticket market. The prices for
opening-ceremony seats range from 2,000 to 7,000 pounds, up from
the face value of 150-2,012 pounds.  “This is a once-every-four-years event,” TiqIQ Chief
Executive Jesse Lawrence said in a telephone interview. “It’s a
marquee event. Part of what’s driving demand here is that it’s a
six-hour flight from the U.S. and people are coming from the
U.S. more for this Olympics as opposed to Beijing.”  The biggest markup is for the last day of the track and
field competition on Aug. 11, with list prices ranging from
2,000 to 2,300 pounds, up from a face value of 50-725 pounds.
The schedule that day includes the men’s 5,000-meter run and the
men’s 400-meter relay, the event in which Usain Bolt set a third
world record four years ago in Beijing with his Jamaican
teammates.  The price for closing-ceremony tickets on Aug. 12 is up an
average of 454 percent over face value, according to TiqIQ. The
listing prices on the secondary market ranges from 1,300 pounds
to 3,620 pounds.  Tickets to the gold-medal game in men’s basketball, where
the U.S. is defending its championship, are listed for more than
eight times their face value, with prices ranging from 1,000
pounds to 3,500 pounds. The original prices for those seats were
95-425 pounds.  NBA Beaten  The lowest-priced ticket of about $1,500 for the gold medal
game is more than the $1,300 average cost for secondary-market
seats to Game 5 of the National Basketball Association Finals
tomorrow, when the  Miami Heat  can clinch the title with a win at
home against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The cheapest Game 5
tickets are being resold for about $400.  “They could win the  NBA championship  and here you’ve got
opening and closing ceremony that has a get-in price north of
that average price,” Lawrence said. “Compared to the major
U.S. sports, you see demand that’s outstripping even the
clinching games of a final for basketball, hockey, baseball or
even the  Super Bowl .”  Other sold-out events with tickets available for more than
quadruple their face value include the men’s and women’s tennis
finals; the men’s basketball semifinals and women’s basketball
gold-medal game; the final pool swimming session including the
men’s and women’s 400-meter medley relays; and the rhythmic
gymnastics finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
