Sudanese authorities early today
released an Agence France-Presse correspondent who was detained
during protests at the University of Khartoum and was held for
12 hours without charge, the Paris-based agency said.  Simon Martelli, a British national, was arrested while
talking to students and taking pictures at the university, which
has been hit by three days of protests against government
austerity measures.  Martelli was questioned at an office of the National
Intelligence and Security Service in the capital, Khartoum,
according to the AFP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
