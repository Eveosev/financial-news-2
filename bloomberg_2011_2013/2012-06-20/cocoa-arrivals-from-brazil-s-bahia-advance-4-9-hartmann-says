Cocoa arrivals from Bahia,  Brazil ’s
biggest growing region, climbed 4.9 percent from a week earlier,
according to analyst  Thomas Hartmann .  Deliveries to shippers and processors were 102,434 bags in
the week ended June 17, Hartmann said in a report yesterday.
That compares with the 97,693 bags he reported a week earlier.
The year-to-date arrivals totaled 552,551 bags, he said. A bag
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  “The cumulative total of the arrivals from Bahia has
already reached the recent peak figure of 2010 and most probably
will overtake it next week,” Hartmann said.  Total arrivals across Brazil were 153,827 bags from 145,064
bags a week earlier, he said.  Bahia accounted for 74 percent of Brazil’s cocoa output and
94 percent of grindings in the past five years, Hartmann said in
an Oct. 12 e-mail. He’s a board member of the Commercial
Association of Bahia and heads the group’s statistical service
on Brazilian production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
