Employees of banks and insurance
companies in  Guinea  may begin a general strike on July 2 to
protest what the workers’ union called “abusive” dismissals,
said Abdoulaye Sow, the group’s secretary-general.  “For the moment no negotiation has begun and if nothing is
done the strike will start,” he said by phone today from
Conakry, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
