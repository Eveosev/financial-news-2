Oil dropped to the lowest price in
eight months in  New York  after U.S. stockpiles unexpectedly
increased and a report signaled  China ’s manufacturing will
shrink this month.  Front-month futures slipped as much as 1.7 percent after
declining 2.7 percent yesterday. U.S. crude supplies rose  2.9
million barrels  last week to 387 million, the highest level
since July 1990, an Energy Department report showed. Federal
Reserve policy makers lowered the outlook for U.S. economic
growth and employment, while an index of Chinese manufacturing
by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics pointed to a
contraction for an eighth month. The U.S. and China are the
world’s biggest oil consumers.  “The Fed comments combined with the inventory numbers give
a sense that the demand destruction is still there,” said
 Jonathan Barratt , chief executive officer of Barratt’s Bulletin,
a commodity-markets newsletter in Sydney, who forecasts that New
York crude has support at $80 a barrel.  Oil for August delivery slid as much as $1.34 to $80.11 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest price for a front-month contract since Oct.
6. It was at $80.42 at 2:41 p.m. Singapore time. Futures are
down 19 percent this year.  Brent oil for August settlement decreased 51 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $92.18 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a
 premium  to West Texas Intermediate of $11.77 after closing at
$11.24 yesterday, the lowest level since January.  China Manufacturing  Oil in New York has technical support along its 200-week
moving average, around $80.63 a barrel. Futures halted last
week’s decline near that indicator. Buy orders tend to be
clustered close to chart-support levels.  An eighth month of contraction in China’s manufacturing
would match the streak during the global financial crisis. The
48.1 preliminary reading for the purchasing managers’ index
released today compares with a final 48.4 for May. If confirmed
on July 2, it would equal the run of below-50 readings from
August 2008 to March 2009.  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  trimmed its oil price
forecasts for WTI and Brent citing weaker economic growth in
China and the U.S., as well as Europe’s debt crisis. The bank
cut its estimate for New York crude in the second quarter to $94
a barrel from $100, and Brent to $111 from $115, in an e-mailed
note today. It also cut its outlook for the rest of the year and
2013.  Fuel Demand  U.S. crude inventories increased in the week ended June 15
as production and imports gained, while total  fuel demand  fell
4.2 percent, the biggest decrease since March, the Energy
Department report showed yesterday. Oil stockpiles were forecast
to decline 1.3 million barrels, according to the median estimate
of 11 analysts in the Bloomberg survey.  Crude output climbed 117,000 barrels a day to 6.35 million,
the highest level since February 1999. Imports rose 328,000
barrels a day to 9.45 million, the highest since March.  Gasoline stockpiles increased 943,000 barrels. They were
forecast to increase  1 million barrels , according to the survey.
Distillate supplies, a category that includes diesel and heating
oil, climbed 1.16 million barrels, compared with a projected 1
million barrel gain.  OPEC Quotas  If oil falls below $80, OPEC may start to “murmur” about
revising production quotas, according to Barratt.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries resolved
to adhere more closely to its output limit of 30 million barrels
a day at a meeting in Vienna on June 14. The decision gives
flexibility to  Saudi Arabia  to cut output depending on demand,
former Algerian Oil Minister  Chakib Khelil  said yesterday in a
Bloomberg Television interview.  Fed officials lowered their estimate for growth in gross
domestic product this year to a range of 1.9 percent to 2.4
percent, compared with an April forecast of 2.4 percent to 2.9
percent. The  unemployment rate  will end the year at 8 percent to
8.2 percent, up from a previous range of 7.8 percent to 8
percent, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
