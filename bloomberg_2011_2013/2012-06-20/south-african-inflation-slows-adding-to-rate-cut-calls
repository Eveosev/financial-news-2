South Africa ’s inflation rate fell
to an eight-month low, giving the central bank more room to cut
borrowing costs to boost growth in Africa’s biggest economy.  The inflation rate fell to 5.7 percent, the lowest since
September, from 6.1 percent a month earlier, Pretoria-based
Statistics South Africa said on its website today. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 16 economists was 5.9 percent.
Prices rose 0.1 percent in the month.  “This reinforces the  Reserve Bank ’s thinking that we have
seen the peak of inflation,”  Razia Khan , head of Africa
economic research at Standard Chartered Plc in  London , said in a
phone interview. Investors will think that “with the rand
likely to appreciate further, the chances are good that we see
another interest rate cut.”  Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus said on June 8 that
policy makers will act without “fear or favor” to adjust
 interest rates  if necessary. Inflation probably peaked in the
first three months of the year and will enter the bank’s target
range of 3 percent to 6 percent after the second quarter, Marcus
said on May 24.  Growth in manufacturing output has slowed and mining
production contracted for a 10th month in April. The economy
will grow 2.7 percent this year, less than the 3.1 expansion
last year, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said in February.  Traders have been boosting bets Marcus will cut the lending
rate from 5.5 percent, the lowest level in more than 30 years.
The yield on forward-rate agreements due in December have
dropped 27 basis points this year to 5.23 percent.  The rand dropped 0.3 percent to 8.2284 per dollar at 10.03
a.m. in Johannesburg, extending the year’s decline to 1.7
percent. The yield on the rand bond due in 2015 dropped 5 basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.01 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
