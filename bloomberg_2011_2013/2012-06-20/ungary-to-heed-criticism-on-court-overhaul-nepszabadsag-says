Hungary agreed to heed criticism
made by the Venice Commission on a judicial overhaul and will
agree to limit the powers of the National Judicial Office
president, Nepszabadsag  reported , citing a legislative bill.  The president must leave office after serving a nine-year
term and the bill will shift powers to a council of judges when
it comes to naming or reprimanding justices, the Budapest-based
daily said, citing a bill that has ruling party support and
whose approval is now a “mere formality.”  The Venice Commission, the Council of  Europe ’s advisory
body on constitutional matters, on March 19 said the
concentration of powers in the hands of the president of the
National Judicial Office lacked “sufficient democratic
accountability” and the court overhaul “as a whole threatens
the independence of the judiciary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
