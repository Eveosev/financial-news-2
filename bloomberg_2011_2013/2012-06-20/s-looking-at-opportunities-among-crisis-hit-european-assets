(Corrects to say MTS isn’t actively pursuing European
assets in first two paragraphs.)  OAO Mobile TeleSystems,  Russia ’s
biggest mobile operator, is keeping its focus on the Russia
region amid opportunities among European assets that have
suffered in the region’s crisis, said Josh Tulgan, MTS investor
relations officer.  “Obviously, we look at opportunities” though the company
doesn’t have an “active goal” to expand beyond its current
market, Tulgan said in a phone interview today from Moscow.
“You can characterize some assets in  Europe  as borderline
distressed.”  “Our focus is maximizing value on the Russian market and
the Ukrainian and the Belarussian markets,” he said.  MTS isn’t considering selling new Eurobonds at the moment,
Tulgan said.  “Right now we don’t have any potential funding needs that
would require us to do something extraordinary,” Tulgan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
