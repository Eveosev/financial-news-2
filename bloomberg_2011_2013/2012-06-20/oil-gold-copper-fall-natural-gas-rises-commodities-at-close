The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities was unchanged at 586.33 at 4:49 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials dropped
0.04 percent to 1452.503.  CRUDE OIL  Brent oil dropped for a third day in London on speculation
that U.S. supplies may have shrunk less than estimated, while
investors awaited the outcome of a Federal Reserve monetary
policy meeting.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , oil for July delivery,
which expires today, was at $83.58 a barrel, down 45 cents, in
electronic trading. It rose 0.9 percent yesterday to $84.03, the
highest close since June 15. The more-actively traded August
contract slid 46 cents to $83.89 a barrel. Front-month prices
are down 15 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures rebounded in  New York  after sliding the
most in a week yesterday.  OIL PRODUCTS  High-sulfur fuel oil rose 14 cents to a premium of 25 cents
a barrel to Asian marker Dubai crude at 11:30 a.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
The gap widened for the first time this week.  Fuel oil  swaps for July climbed $4.25, or 0.7 percent, to
$597.75 a metric ton, PVM said. Prices rebounded from the lowest
in two weeks. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-
centistoke grade, or the viscosity spread, was unchanged after
falling to $9.50. This means bunker, or marine fuel, moved in
tandem with higher-quality supplies used in power stations.  Naphtha swaps for July dropped $5.50, or 0.7 percent, to
$738.50 a ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock is at the lowest in records that started in January
2011. Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
lost $5.50 to $17.04 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of processing profit,
narrowed for a second day.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday slid to $18.66 a
barrel, the lowest since April 26, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. A narrowing reforming margin indicates it is less
profitable to make motor fuel.  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude was down
53 cents at $15.67 a barrel, according to PVM. The difference,
also known as the crack spread, was the narrowest in a week.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold is set to decline for a second day in  London  as
investors await the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s monetary-
policy meeting.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$1,617.02 an ounce by 9:16 a.m. in London. August-delivery
futures were 0.4 percent lower at $1,617.50 on the Comex in New
York.  BASE METALS  Copper declined as inventories in London Metal Exchange
warehouses advanced to the highest level in almost two months
and on speculation that stockpiles in  Shanghai  may snap 10 weeks
of losses.  Three-month metal lost as much as 0.6 percent to $7,567 a
metric ton on the LME before trading at $7,595 by 2:42 p.m. in
Shanghai. Copper for September delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
$3.4350 a pound on the Comex in New York.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil  climbed the most in almost 19 months on concern
that dry weather may damage U.S. soybean crops, lowering global
supplies and increasing demand for alternative cooking oils.  The September-delivery contract advanced as much as 3.6
percent to 3,053 ringgit ($967) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the biggest intraday gain for the most-
active contract since November 2010. Futures ended the morning
session at 3,038 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur .  Palm oil for January delivery gained 2.2 percent to 7,988
 yuan  ($1,257) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .  Soybean
oil  for delivery in the same month advanced 1.6 percent to 9,470
yuan a ton.  Soybeans advanced, extending the biggest gain since March,
as dry weather persisted in the U.S. Midwest, deepening concern
supply will trail a government forecast.  November-delivery soybeans gained as much as 0.8 percent to
$13.9575 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade after climbing
3.4 percent yesterday. The contract traded at $13.905 at 3:25
p.m. Singapore time, up for a fourth straight day.  Corn for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to $5.615 after
jumping 11 percent in the past two days, the most since October
2010. Wheat for December delivery added 0.2 percent to $6.9475 a
bushel.  Rubber gained for a second day this week as better-than-
expected Japanese trade data raised optimism demand may improve,
amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will consider further
economic stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
