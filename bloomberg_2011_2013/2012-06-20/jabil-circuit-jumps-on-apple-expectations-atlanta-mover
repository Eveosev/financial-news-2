Jabil Circuit Inc. rose the most in
eight months on the expectation that it will generate more
business from Apple Inc.’s next iteration of the iPhone.  Shares of the  St. Petersburg , Florida-based electronics
supplier closed at $20.75 in New York, up 6.8 percent, for the
highest closing price since October. Jabil, which makes
components for  Research in Motion Ltd (RIM)  as well as Apple,
initially fell more than 3 percent post-market yesterday after
reporting  earnings .  “Jabil’s relationship with Apple is growing stronger,” said
Brian Alexander, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates Inc.
in St. Petersburg. He expects Jabil to benefit as Apple
transitions to the iPhone 5.  “The relative stability in the business heading into a
seasonally stronger part of the year is giving investors
confidence that the worst is behind us and that this is really
good business trading at a really low price,” Alexander added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
