India ’s rupee dropped for a third
day after the central bank said the nation may need to sacrifice
economic growth to control price gains.  Inflation exceeds acceptable levels,  Reserve Bank  of India
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said yesterday. The wholesale-price
index climbed 7.55 percent in May from a year earlier, which is
above the tolerance level of 7.5 percent, he said. Funds based
abroad  sold  $107 million more local equities than they bought on
June 18, the biggest outflow in almost two weeks, exchange data
show.  “The evolving economic fundamentals are not going to
support the rupee,” said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at
state-run  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai. “Therefore investor sentiment
is weak.”  The rupee dropped 0.3 percent to 56.145 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched a record low of 56.515 on May 31.  Three-month  offshore  non-deliverable forwards traded at
57.29 a dollar, compared with 57.07 yesterday, while the onshore
contracts were at 57.17 from 56.95. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
