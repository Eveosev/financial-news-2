Bentley,  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s super-
luxury unit, introduced the Continental GT Speed, its fastest-
ever model in a bid to woo performance-hungry buyers.  The model, which will debut at this year’s Goodwood
Festival of Speed on June 28, is priced at 151,100 pounds
($237,600) and reaches 205 miles (329 kilometers) per hour, the
Crewe, England-based carmaker said today in e-mailed statement.  The Continental GT Speed edges ahead of the brand’s Super
Sports model, which has a top speed of 204 mph. The new Bentley
accelerates to 60 mph in 4 seconds, the company said. First
deliveries are expected this fall. The car is inspired by the
Speed models that first appeared in 1923.  The latest Bentley model comes as exotic automakers look to
expand their product range to boost sales. Aston Martin today
unveiled the 565-horsepower Vanquish, its second-most powerful
car after the 1.2 million-pound One-77. The new model, which
starts at 190,000 pounds, boasts a top speed of 183 mph.  VW’s Lamborghini unveiled a sport-utility vehicle concept
in April. Bentley showcased its own SUV concept in March.  Fiat
SpA (F) ’s Maserati plans to start production of an SUV based on the
Kubang concept next year.  China emerged as Bentley’s largest market in the first
quarter with 578 cars sold, up 85 percent from a year ago.
Worldwide, the brand delivered 1,759 units in the first three
months of 2012, up 47 percent. Bentley’s product range is
currently topped by the Mulsanne, priced at around 230,000
pounds. The company declined to provide a sales target for the
Continental GT Speed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
