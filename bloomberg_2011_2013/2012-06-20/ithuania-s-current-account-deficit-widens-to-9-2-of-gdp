Lithuania ’s  current-account  deficit
more than doubled in the first quarter to the widest gap since
2008 after the European Union suspended regional development
aid.  The shortfall ballooned to 9.2 percent of gross domestic
product from 3.8 percent in the previous three months, the
Vilnius-based central bank said in a  statement  on its website
today. The gap totaled 2.3 billion litai ($840 million), it
said.  The Baltic nation’s current-account deteriorated after the
European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, suspended transfers
from cohesion funds in February after reviewing a report by the
Lithuanian state auditor, which required additional explanation
on the distribution of the aid. The commission resumed regional
development aid in May after the  Finance Ministry  provided the
required information.  The capital and financial account, which mainly represents
EU aid for Lithuania’s investment projects, narrowed to 98
million litai in the first quarter from 597 million litai in the
previous three months, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
