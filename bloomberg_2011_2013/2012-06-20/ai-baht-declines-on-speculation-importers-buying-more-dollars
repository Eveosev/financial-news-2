Thailand ’s baht fell on speculation
importers are stepping up dollar buying to take advantage of a
more favorable exchange-rate.  Government bonds  rose.  The currency touched the strongest level in almost a month
on June 18. Imports climbed 8 percent in May after an increase
of 7.87 percent in April, while exports rose 0.65 percent
following a 3.67 percent decline, according to the median
estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before official
data next week. Global funds sold $61 million more Thai equities
than they bought in the first two days of this week, taking net
sales this month to $288 million, exchange data show.  “Imports have been growing at quite a fast pace, while
exports aren’t recovering much,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a
researcher at the Japan Center for  Economic Research  in  Tokyo .
“Which means there’s more consistent demand for the dollar and
other currencies.”  The baht dropped 0.2 percent to 31.44 per dollar as of 8:33
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 31.33 on June 18, the strongest level since May
22. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52 percent.  The Bank of Thailand cut it export-growth forecast for this
year to 8 percent from its earlier projection of 9 percent due
to the deepening crisis in  Europe , Songtham Pinto, director of
the central bank’s office of macroeconomics, said yesterday.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 declined
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.32 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the lowest
level since February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
