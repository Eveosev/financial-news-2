The Australian swimming team’s
Olympic tuneup meet in Canberra this week was canceled after two
female water polo players and a coach were diagnosed with
whooping cough.  Swimming  Australia  said it called off the two-day Grand
Prix at the Australian Institute of Sport on June 22 and 23 to
ensure its athletes stay healthy for the  London  games, which
begin July 27.  “We have decided to take this precaution,” Leigh Nugent,
Swimming Australia’s head coach, said in an e-mailed statement.
“Originally we’d planned to have this camp as an opportunity to
come together for some further relay preparation and the chance
for some of the athletes to race and time trial, a month or so
out from the games.”  Swimmers will remain in their home states to continue their
preparations before the first group travels to  Europe  next week,
Swimming Australia said. The team, which includes 100-meter
freestyle world champion James Magnussen and three-time Olympic
champion Stephanie Rice, will next assemble for a training camp
in Manchester,  England , on July 14 before heading to London six
days later.  The Australian Institute of Sport said it was taking the
outbreak “very seriously” and had placed the water polo team
in isolation to try to prevent the infection spreading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
