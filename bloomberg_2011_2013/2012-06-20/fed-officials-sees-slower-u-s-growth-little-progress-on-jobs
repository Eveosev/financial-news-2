Federal Reserve officials cut their
estimates for 2012 growth after last month’s slowdown in hiring
and see little progress on unemployment during the rest of the
year.  Fed officials lowered their central tendency estimate for
U.S. 2012 gross domestic product growth to 1.9 percent to 2.4
percent from 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent in April. Estimates for
2013 centered around 2.2 percent to 2.8 percent, compared with
2.7 percent to 3.1 percent in the previous forecast.  Consumers and businesses are restraining spending as
European financial stress has knocked down U.S. stock prices.
Yields on corporate borrowing rates have increased as investors
flee from risk.  “Financial conditions are becoming somewhat more adverse
for the economy,” said Kathleen Stephansen, senior investment
strategist and global head of sovereign research at AIG Asset
Management in  New York . “The markets are still fragile.”  Seven Federal Open Market Committee participants said the
first interest rate increase would occur in 2014, while six said
it would occur in 2015. U.S. central bankers cut the benchmark
lending rate to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in December
2008.  The Fed released the projections after a two-day meeting at
which policy makers decided to expand their program to replace
short-term bonds with longer-term debt by $267 billion through
the end of 2012.  Downward Pressure  The continuation of the program, known as Operation Twist,
“should put downward pressure on longer-term  interest rates  and
help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative,”
the Federal Open Market Committee said today in Washington.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has fallen 4.3 percent from
its 12-month high of 1,419.04 on April 2. Yield spreads on the
Credit Suisse U.S. Liquid Corporate Index, which tracks almost
1,300 U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds with an average
maturity of about 10 years, widened to as much as 1.865
percentage points over Treasuries of similar maturity this
month, the highest since January.  FedEx Corp. (FDX) , operator of the world’s largest cargo airline,
said this week that first-quarter profit would be lower than
analysts estimated amid slowing U.S. economic growth. Average
daily package volume in the U.S. fell 4.9 percent in FedEx’s
fiscal fourth quarter, through May 31, a more rapid decline than
in the three months through February, the company said
yesterday.  Too Weak  The moderate rate of growth means demand is too weak to
achieve full employment by 2014, according to Fed estimates.  Officials forecast the jobless rate will average 8 percent
to 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter of this year versus an
estimate of 7.8 to 8 percent in April. For next year, their
unemployment forecasts centered around 7.5 percent to 8 percent
versus prior estimates of 7.3 to 7.7. They expect the jobless
rate to average 7 percent to 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter
of 2014, according to the central tendency estimate, which
excludes the three highest and three lowest forecasts.  Officials’ longer run estimate for unemployment, a proxy
for their guess at the level at which the U.S. labor market is
efficiently deployed, was unchanged at 5.2 to 6 percent.  The Fed released the expectations of the seven Fed board
members and 12 district bank presidents after the  Federal Open
Market Committee  today said “household spending appears to be
rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.”  Twelve officials vote on the policy statement, while the
interest-rate and economic projections reflect the views of all
19 Fed officials. The so-called central tendency economic
forecasts exclude the three highest and three lowest
projections.  U.S. central bankers estimate that moderate rates of growth
and labor market slack will help keep inflation at or below
their goal of 2 percent per year. They forecast the  price index 
for personal consumption expenditures would rise 1.2 percent to
1.7 percent in 2012, and 1.5 percent to 2 percent in 2013,
according to central tendency estimates. They estimated prices
would rise 1.5 percent to 2 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
