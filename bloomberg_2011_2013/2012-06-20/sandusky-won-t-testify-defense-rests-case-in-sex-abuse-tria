The trial of Jerry Sandusky, the
former  Pennsylvania  State University assistant football coach
accused of molesting young boys, is scheduled for closing
arguments today.  Through his lead attorney, Joseph Amendola, Sandusky, 68,
has denied the sexual-abuse allegations, insisting that he
didn’t do the things at least eight alleged victims said he did
-- including touching them inappropriately and engaging them in
oral sex. The defense rested its case yesterday in state court
in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, after Sandusky declined to testify.  Sandusky faces 51 counts related to assaulting 10 boys over
15 years. Each count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse
is punishable by as long as 20 years in prison. The trial began
June 11.  Prosecutors say Sandusky used the charity he founded in
1977,  the Second Mile , to recruit victims, “grooming” them
with gifts, trips to football games and money, and luring them
into athletic shower rooms, hotels and his house.  Sandusky’s wife, Dottie, testified June 19 that she never
had any indication of the alleged misconduct by her husband.  During most of a week of defense testimony, Amendola
presented a string of witnesses who said Sandusky was likeable
and of good character.  The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Sandusky,
CP-14-2422-2011, Court of Common Pleas, Centre County,
Pennsylvania (Bellefonte).  To contact the reporters on this story:
