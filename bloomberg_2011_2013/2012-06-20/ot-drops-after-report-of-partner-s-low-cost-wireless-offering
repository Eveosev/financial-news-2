Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT) ,
which started offering wireless services in May, fell to the
lowest in almost three weeks after Calcalist reported Partner
Communications Co. plans to set up a low-cost wireless brand.  Shares of Yakum, Israel-based Hot, which also provides
Internet, fixed-line and cable-television services, retreated
3.8 percent to 34.19 shekels, the lowest intraday level since
May 31, at 10:28 a.m. in Tel Aviv. The TA-25 Index decreased 0.4
percent.  Partner would offer the services through a unit under the
brand Mobile 012, Calcalist reported late yesterday. An official
at Partner, who asked that her name not be used, confirmed the
report by phone today, without providing further details.
Partner  declined  1.3 percent to 17.37 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
