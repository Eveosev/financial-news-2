Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s Warner Bros. sold
“2 Broke Girls,” last season’s top-rated new comedy, for rerun
on CBS television stations and its own TBS cable network.  CBS Corp. stations will air the show outside of prime time
in late 2014, while TBS will carry episodes in 2015, Burbank,
California-based Warner Bros. said today in a statement.  Broadcast and cable networks are locking up rerun rights
earlier, in some cases after a single season, to ensure they
have shows with established audiences. That in turn helps TV
studios defray costs sooner and boost revenue. In 2009,  CBS
Corp. (CBS)  sold “NCIS: Los Angeles” reruns to the USA cable network
after seven episodes.  Time Warner, based in  New York , fell 0.5 percent to $37.13
at the close of New York  trading . It has climbed 2.7 percent
this year. CBS, which airs original episodes of “2 Broke
Girls” in prime time, gained 0.2 percent to $32.02.  To contact the reporter on this story:
