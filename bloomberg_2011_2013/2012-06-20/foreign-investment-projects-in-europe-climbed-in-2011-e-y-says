The number of projects in  Europe 
that drew foreign investment rose in 2011 even as the region
grappled with a sovereign-debt crisis, Ernst & Young said.  The total number of projects rose to 3,906 last year from
3,757 in 2010, Ernst & Young said in its annual survey released
today, without stating the value of investments received. Jobs
created as a result climbed 15 percent in 2011, it said.  The U.S. remains the largest investor in Europe, with the
U.K. continuing to be the favorite destination, according to the
report.  Germany  overtook  France  to come in second, with business
services, software and automotive sectors drawing the greatest
interest in the region, it said.  “Despite the current turmoil in Europe, its fundamental
strengths continue to endure,” Marc Lhermitte, the London-based
Ernst & Young partner who wrote the report, said in a statement.
“However, given the current economic climate it remains to be
seen if this will hold true for the rest of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
