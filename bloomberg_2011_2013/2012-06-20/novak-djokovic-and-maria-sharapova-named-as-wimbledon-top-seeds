Defending champion Novak Djokovic of
Serbia and French Open winner  Maria Sharapova  of Russia were
named as the  top seeds  at Wimbledon.  Rafael Nadal of Spain, who won his 11th major at Roland
Garros last week by beating Djokovic, was seeded second,
according to an e-mailed statement today from  Wimbledon 
organizers. Six-time champion  Roger Federer  of Switzerland was
third, followed by Britain’s Andy Murray.  Defending women’s champion Petra Kvitova of the Czech
Republic was seeded fourth, with Australian Open champion
Victoria Azarenka of Belarus second and Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska third.  Four-time winner  Serena Williams  of the U.S. is at No. 6
while her sister and five-time champion Venus wasn’t given a
seeding. Venus Williams is ranked 55th on the WTA Tour and has
not been playing a full schedule since being diagnosed with
energy-sapping Sjogren’s syndrome last year.  Kim Clijsters , a four-time Grand Slam champion who missed
the clay-court season because of a hip injury, also isn’t
seeded. The Belgian is ranked 53rd on the WTA tour.  The seeding order in the women’s draw at Wimbledon followed
this year’s WTA rankings, while the men’s seeds were based on
the ATP World Tour rankings and performance on grass courts over
the past twelve months.  Andy Roddick of the U.S., a three-time finalist, was seeded
30th, three spots higher than his ranking. Mardy Fish is the
highest-seeded American man at 10, one place above John Isner.  Wimbledon starts June 25 at the All England Club in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
