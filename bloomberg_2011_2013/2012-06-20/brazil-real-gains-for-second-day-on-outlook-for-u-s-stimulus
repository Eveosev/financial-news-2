Brazil ’s real gained for a second
day on prospects the  Federal Reserve  will announce further
stimulus when it concludes its two-day meeting today.  The real rose 0.3 percent to 2.0233 per  U.S. dollar  at 9:35
a.m. in Sao Paulo, trimming its decline this year to 7.7
percent. The yield on the Brazilian interest-rate futures
contract due in January 2014 rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 8.05 percent.  “The dollar fell on expectations of a Fed decision,” said
Jorge Dib, portfolio manager at Grau Gestao de Ativos, in a
phone interview from Sao Paulo. “The market can celebrate, but
the effect will be short-term.”  A dozen of the 21 primary dealers who trade with the Fed
expect some form of monetary easing to be announced today,
according to a survey by Bloomberg News. The dollar fell to the
weakest level in almost a month against the euro, as demand for
17-nation currency was bolstered after leaders at a Group of 20
meeting pledged to take “all necessary policy measures” to
defend the currency union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
