Somalia  may harvest a below-average
main crop in the country’s south after late rainfall, which may
prolong the lean season by a month and cause  food security  to
deteriorate, the U.S. Agency for International Development said.  The so-called Gu harvest has been harmed by moisture stress
as well as pest infestations, USAID wrote in a  report  on its
website today. Most parts of the rain-fed crop areas in the
south received only very light rain in May, it wrote.  Humanitarian aid will have to be stepped up in coming
months to respond to emergency food assistance needs, according
to USAID. A famine in southern Somalia last year that caused
tens of thousands of deaths ended in February, according to the
 United Nations .  “Food security of poor, agropastoral households is likely
to deteriorate to emergency levels in June,” USAID wrote.
“Though a return to famine in southern Somalia is not expected,
a scaling up of humanitarian assistance and activation of the
contingency planning process are necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
