JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s $2 billion
trading loss doesn’t help Goldman Sachs Group Inc. or the rest
of the banking industry, Goldman Sachs President  Gary Cohn  said.  Bankers do best when their industry is well-respected,
Cohn, 51, said in an interview today with Erik Schatzker on
Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers.” JPMorgan, the biggest
U.S. bank, has done a good job disclosing the loss and dealing
with the fallout, Cohn said. Both companies are based in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
