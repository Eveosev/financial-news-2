Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL) , a
Macau casino operator, rose to a three-week high in New York
after Sterne Agee & Leach Equity Research said in a report a new
resort will resume construction in 45 days.  Melco’s American depositary receipts jumped 2.8 percent to
$12.23, the highest price since May 29. It traded 3.5 percent
 above  the Hong Kong shares, the largest premium since March 8.
Melco has dropped 10 percent this quarter after surging 42
percent in the first.  Construction of Melco’s Studio City Macau resort will
resume in about 45 days and begin operations within three years,
Sterne Agee analyst  David Bain  said in a report today, without
citing a source for the information. Melco is better positioned
than its competitors to take advantage of the expansion of
Macau’s increasingly popular Cotai Strip, he said.  “A pipeline in Macau is very difficult to come by, and
Melco has it,” said Bain, in a phone interview from  Newport
Beach , California. “The shares have traded down this quarter
and don’t yet reflect the Studio City project.”  Melco, a venture between Australian billionaire  James
Packer  and a son of gambling tycoon  Stanley Ho , is seeking to
raise about $2.2 billion through a loan and bond sale to fund
the Studio City project, two people familiar with the matter
have said.  Bain has a buy recommendation on Melco with a 12-month
price target of $23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
