Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , owner of the largest
U.S. Web portal, is in talks to resolve a patent-infringement
dispute with  Facebook Inc. (FB) , according to a court filing.  Lawyers for Yahoo asked U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White in  San Francisco  yesterday for a two-week extension on
deadlines to file replies in the lawsuit while the companies
hold discussions. The lawyers also asked for a two-week delay in
a motion hearing now set for Aug. 10, according to the filing.  “The parties are currently engaged in settlement
negotiations to resolve this dispute,” Kevin Smith, a Yahoo
lawyer, said in the filing. “The parties believe that a further
extension will facilitate settlement.”  Yahoo sued Facebook in March, alleging that the social-
networking provider infringes patents covering such functions as
Internet privacy, advertising and information sharing. Facebook
countersued in April, accusing Yahoo of infringing 10 of its
patents.  Scott Thompson , who was Yahoo’s chief executive officer at
the time, has since resigned after failing to correct
misstatements in his academic record.  Dana Lengkeek, a spokeswoman for Sunnyvale, California-
based Yahoo, declined to comment on the proposed delay. Andrew Noyes, a spokesman for Menlo Park,  California-based Facebook ,
also declined to comment.  The case is Yahoo! Inc. v. Facebook, 12-cv-01212, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporters on this story:
