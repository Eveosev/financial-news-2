Ethanol  production  in the U.S. sank
2.2 percent to 900,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department.  Output slid the most since Feb. 24 to a six-week low, the
department said in its weekly report. Stockpiles jumped 2.5
percent, the most since May 18, to 21.2 million barrels.  Ethanol makers are losing about 13 cents on every gallon of
the fuel produced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
assuming one bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of the
fuel.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest U.S. ethanol
producer, idled its 110 million-gallon-a-year plant in Albion,
 Nebraska , because of the negative margins,  Bill Day , a company
spokesman said in an e-mail today.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery fell 1.2 cents to $2.10
a gallon at 11:20 a.m.  New York  time on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  Day said that Valero expects to restart the distillery
prior to the September corn harvest.  “At this point Albion is the only plant among Valero
Renewables’ 10 ethanol plants that has halted production, but we
continue to closely monitor market conditions” throughout the
system, he said.  Production of  conventional gasoline blended with ethanol 
slumped 2.7 percent to 5.36 million barrels a day from a record
the previous week, the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
