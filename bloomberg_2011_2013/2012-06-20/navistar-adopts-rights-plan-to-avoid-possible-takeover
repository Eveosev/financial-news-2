Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the 
maker of heavy-duty trucks, said its board adopted a stockholder 
rights plan to prevent “coercive takeover tactics.”  Hedge fund manager Mark Rachesky last week disclosed he
controls a 13.6 percent stake in Navistar. His former mentor,
billionaire investor  Carl Icahn , owns  11.9 percent .  One preferred stock purchase right will be distributed as a
dividend on each share held as of June 29, Navistar said in a
statement. The rights are exercisable if a shareholder acquires
15 percent or more of common stock or starts a tender offer that
would lead to a stake larger than 15 percent, the company said.  Navistar, based in Lisle,  Illinois , this month lowered its
annual profit forecast to a range of break-even to $2 a share as
it copes with the repercussions of pursuing a emission-reduction
technology that has prevented it from winning U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency certification for its 13-liter engine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
