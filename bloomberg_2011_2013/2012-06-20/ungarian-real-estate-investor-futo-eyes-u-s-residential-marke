Gabor Futo, co-founder of the
Budapest-based central European property group Futureal, plans
to establish a U.S. company with initial funding of $15 million
to build a residential-property portfolio of 500 homes.  The U.S.-based company, Cordia USA, will make its first
acquisitions in the states of Georgia and  Michigan  with plans to
renovate and rent the homes before selling them within five
years,  Futureal  said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Houses are foreclosed on, U.S. residential-property
prices are falling, which we see as a very attractive investment
opportunity,” Futo said in the statement. “The company
believes that a new asset class is emerging in the U.S.,
allowing for the financing and selling of its single family
homes as income producing portfolios.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
