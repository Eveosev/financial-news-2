Burundi’s opposition Party of
Workers and Democracy began a countrywide campaign against
government liberalization of the coffee industry, which it said
was giving national wealth to foreign companies.  The political group and two student unions are gathering
signatures from rural people, farmers and coffee industry
officials across the East African nation, party leader Paul
Nkunzimana told reporters yesterday in Bujumbura, the capital.  Coffee equipment worth more than $25 million “was given to
private operators at only $3 million,” Nkunzimana said.  Burundi earns 70 percent of its foreign exchange from
coffee, according to the  African Development Bank . The
government plans to sell or has sold all 145 coffee-washing
stations to private companies, a process urged by the  World Bank 
as a condition for budget support.  Privatization Minister Issa Ngendakumana did not answer
three calls to his office seeking comment.  Burundi grows mainly arabica coffee and on June 11 forecast
production to more than double to 27,819 metric tons. More than
two-thirds of Burundians live in poverty, according to the
 International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
