Peru’s government will increase its
economic stimulus package by 2 billion soles ($758 million) to

 reported , citing Finance Minister Miguel Castilla.  The funds will be spent on infrastructure projects and
maintenance and two-thirds will be used this year, Castilla
said, according to the state-owned newspaper.  The government also extended the duration of stimulus
