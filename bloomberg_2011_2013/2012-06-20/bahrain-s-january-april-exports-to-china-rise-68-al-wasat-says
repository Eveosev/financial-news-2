Bahrain’s exports to  China  increased
68 percent, to $210 million, in the first four months of 2012
from a year earlier, al-Wasat reported, citing Guo Hu, who heads
the commercial section at China’s Bahrain embassy.  The increase is “probably” due to a rise in
petrochemicals sales, the  newspaper  cited Guo Hu as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
