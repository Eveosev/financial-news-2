U.K. unemployment claims 
unexpectedly rose in May, suggesting the labor market may be
starting to succumb to Europe’s intensifying debt crisis.  Jobless-benefit claims climbed 8,100 from April to 1.6
million, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in
London. The median forecast of 20 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a drop of 4,000. The  unemployment rate  as
measured by International Labour Organization methods was
unchanged at 8.2 percent in the three months though April.  “The claimant-count numbers tend to lead what happens in
unemployment, so these numbers are a bit worrying,” said  George Buckley , an economist at Deutsche Bank AG in London. “I
wouldn’t be surprised if this is a response to the euro crisis.
Employment may weaken -- that means potentially worse numbers on
the public finances.”  The figures suggest the labor-market recovery is running
out of steam, increasing pressure on Prime Minister  David Cameron . His budget cuts have been blamed by the opposition
 Labour Party  for pushing the U.K. into its first double-dip
recession since the 1970s at a time when the euro-region crisis
is casting a shadow on prospects for the economy.  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  and three other policy
makers were overruled in a push to expand the bank’s bond-
purchase program as a majority said more stimulus was likely to
be needed as risks from the crisis mounted, minutes of the June
7 decision published today showed.  Pound, Bonds  The pound was little changed against the dollar at $1.5724
as of 9:58 a.m in London. The yield on the 10-year government
bond was also unchanged at 1.719 percent.  The jobless-claims rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent in
May. In April, jobless claims fell 12,800 rather than the
previously estimated 13,700 drop. In the three months through
April, ILO unemployment fell 51,000 to 2.62 million people.  Employment rose 166,000 to 29.3 million, the biggest
increase since June-August 2010 with gains in full-time and
part-time work.  Still, the number of people out of work for more than a
year rose in the February-to April period and now stands at 34
percent of total unemployment. In addition, the number of people
working part-time because they could not find a full-time job
climbed 25,000 to 1.41 million over the period. There was also
an increase in self-employment as people unable to find work
turned to working for themselves.  In the first quarter, public-sector employment fell by
39,000 to 5.9 million, the lowest since March 2003, while
employment in the private sector increased by 205,000 to 23.4
million, the statistics office said.  ‘Black Cloud’  King last week unveiled measures to fight the escalating
euro-area crisis as he warned of a “black cloud” from  Europe 
that may hurt Britain’s economy.  The U.K.’s jobless rate compares with 8.2 percent in the
U.S. and is well below the 11 percent in the euro region, where
property busts in Spain and Ireland shattered the labor-
intensive house-building industry.  It is also below the peaks reached after recessions in the
early 1980s and early 1990s, when unemployment climbed above 10
percent. That suggests firms have hoarded workers, leaving scope
for a renewed round of job shedding if the recovery proves
weaker than anticipated.  Annual pay growth quickened to 1.4 percent in the three
months through April from 0.9 percent in the three previous
months, today’s figures showed. Pay growth less bonuses
accelerated to 1.8 percent from 1.6. Inflation slowed to 2.8
percent in April, easing the squeeze on household budgets, data
showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
