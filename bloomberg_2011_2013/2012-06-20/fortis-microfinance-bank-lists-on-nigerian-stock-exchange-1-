Fortis Microfinance Bank Plc listed
1.63 billion shares on the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  today at 5
naira each, Oscar Onyema, chief executive officer of the bourse,
told reporters in Lagos, the commercial capital.  Fortis will undertake a secondary equity offering to raise
2 billion naira ($12.3 million) and also sell five-year bonds to
raise 5 billion naira, Kunle Oketikun, managing director and
chief executive officer, said. Abuja-based Fortis is looking for
approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, and plans
for the sales are expected to be concluded in six months, he
said.  Funds will be used for purposes including increasing
working capital and acquiring a national licence, according to
Oketikun. Target investors for the bond sale will be
institutional investors, “especially the pension fund
administrators,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
