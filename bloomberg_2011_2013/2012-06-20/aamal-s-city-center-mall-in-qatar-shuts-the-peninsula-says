Aamal Co. (AHCS) ’s City Center mall in
Qatar is closed because of faults in its safety system, and no
date has been set for reopening,  The Peninsula  reported, without
saying how the information was obtained.  The mall has been shut since June 15, the newspaper said.
An Aamal spokesman wasn’t available for comment when contacted
by phone.  The shutdown of City Center comes after the Villaggio mall
was closed following a May 28 fire that killed 19 people
including 13 children in a child play center. City Center and
Villaggio are the biggest malls in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
