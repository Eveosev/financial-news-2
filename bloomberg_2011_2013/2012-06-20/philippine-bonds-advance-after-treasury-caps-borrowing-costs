Philippine bonds gained after the
government capped borrowing costs at yesterday’s sale of 20-year
securities. The peso halted a two-day decline.  The Bureau of the Treasury sold 6.7 billion pesos ($159
million) of notes, less than the 9 billion pesos on offer, with
bids reaching 14.1 billion pesos. The debt was sold at an
average yield of 6.02 percent, which would have risen to 6.05
percent if the government had met its sales target, data from
the treasury showed. The  Philippines ’ BB+ long-term foreign-
currency rating with a stable outlook was reaffirmed by  Fitch
Ratings  yesterday.  “The auction was better than expected and the bids were
below the market consensus,” said Speedy Delfino, a fixed-
income trader at East West Bank Corp. in  Manila . “The positive
news on the external environment also supports investor
confidence.”  The yield on the 5.875 percent notes due February 2032 fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 5.95 percent as
of 4:12 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial
Services. The peso closed 0.4 percent higher at 42.11 per dollar,
data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. One-month implied
volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to price
options, rose 46 basis points to 6.96 percent.  The Philippines is rated at the highest junk level by Fitch
and two levels below investment grade by  Standard & Poor’s  and
Moody’s Investors Service. Achieving an investment-grade rating
is only “a matter of time,” the government said in a statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
