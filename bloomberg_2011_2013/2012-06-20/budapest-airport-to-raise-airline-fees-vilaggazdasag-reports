Budapest Airport Zrt., the operator
of the Hungarian capital’s international airport, plans to boost
fees for airlines after its property tax more than tripled,
 Vilaggazdasag   said , citing Chief Executive Office Jost Lammers.  Budapest Airport’s property tax increased to 2.25 billion
forint ($10 million) from 675 million forint even after the
collapse of state-owned carrier Malev Zrt. cut revenue and
triggered cost-cuts at the airport, that included the closing of
a terminal, Lammers said in an interview in the Budapest-based
business newspaper.  Budapest Airport reported an 8 billion forint loss before
taxes last year and “because of Malev’s bankruptcy it’s certain
that this won’t be smaller” this year, Lammers told
Vilaggazdasag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
