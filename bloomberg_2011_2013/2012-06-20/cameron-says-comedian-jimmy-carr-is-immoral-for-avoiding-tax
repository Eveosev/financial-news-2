U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
described comedian Jimmy Carr as immoral after he was reported
to be sheltering more than 3 million pounds ($4.7 million) in
income a year from tax.  The  Times newspaper  reported yesterday that Carr used a
tax-avoidance plan named K2, based on the Channel Island of
 Jersey , to avoid paying tax on the bulk of his income. The
newspaper today named Gary Barlow, a singer with the band Take
That who was awarded an honor by  Queen Elizabeth II  last week,
as among those using a different mechanism to avoid tax.  The prime minister, speaking in Mexico following the Group
of 20 summit, said he hadn’t had time to study the allegations
against Barlow, who campaigned for his Conservatives during the
2010 election. Cameron’s office had earlier today defended
giving Barlow an honor on the grounds of the work he did for the
queen’s Diamond Jubilee this month.  “Some of these schemes where people are parking huge
amounts of money offshore and taking loans back to just minimize
their  tax rate , it is just not morally acceptable,” Cameron
told ITV News. “Think of all those people who work hard, who
pay their taxes, and out of their post-tax income save up to see
Jimmy Carr. He’s taking that money and stuffing it into
something where he doesn’t have to pay tax on it. That is not
fair. That is not right. It isn’t morally right to do that.”  Carr’s management didn’t respond to a call and an e-mail
requesting comment. Barlow’s record company didn’t reply to a
phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
