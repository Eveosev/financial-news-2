President  Barack Obama  scolded the
campaign of Republican candidate  Mitt Romney  for an article
critical of U.S. policy written by one of its advisers and
published in Germany.  “We have one president at a time and one administration at
a time,” Obama said when asked today about the article in the
German Handelsblatt newspaper by  Glenn Hubbard , dean of Columbia
University’s business school. “And I think traditionally the
notion has been that America’s political differences end at the
water’s edge.”  Hubbard, a former adviser to President George W. Bush,
wrote earlier this month that Obama was trying to force Germany
to assume responsibility for financially weak governments and
banks. That was unwise and reflecting a lack of knowledge about
the sources of the crisis, Hubbard said in the German-language
article.  Hubbard “may not be familiar with what our suggestions to
the Germans have been,” Obama told reporters at a news
conference following the Group of 20 summit in Los Cabos,
Mexico. “Sometimes back home there is a desire to superimpose
whatever ideological arguments are taking place back home onto a
very complicated situation in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
