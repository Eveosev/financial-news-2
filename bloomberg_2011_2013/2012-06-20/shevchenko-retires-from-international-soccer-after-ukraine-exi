Andriy Shevchenko  said he’s retiring
from international soccer following Ukraine’s elimination from
the European Championship.  Shevchenko, 35, was omitted from the starting line-up for
last night’s final group game against  England  because of a knee
injury. Ukraine, which had to win to reach the quarterfinals,
lost 1-0 at the Donbass Arena in Donetsk.  “It was my last official game for Ukraine,” the striker
said. “A bit later on I will arrange a farewell game to say
goodbye to supporters.”  Shevchenko has scored every year for the national team
since making his debut for Ukraine in 1995. He scored 48 goals
in 111 international matches and was captain for Ukraine’s only
World Cup appearance in 2006. He got both goals in a 2-1 victory
over  Sweden  on June 11.  Shevchenko rose to prominence after winning five league
championships in as many years at  Dynamo Kiev . He was voted
European Player of the Year in 2004, a year after he won the
 Champions League  with AC Milan.  Shevchenko returned to Kiev in 2009 following three years
at Chelsea, where he failed to show the form that persuaded the
London team to pay Milan 30.8 million pounds ($48.4 million) to
release him.  Shevchenko said Ukraine’s younger players showed in the
defeat to England that they can continue to challenge top teams.  “We were in control and had many chances to score,”
Shevchenko said. “I’m glad for our young players who played
well tonight. This team has a bright future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
