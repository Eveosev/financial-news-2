Greece  must step up enforcement of
laws that prohibit the bribing of foreign officials, the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development’s Working
Group on Bribery said.  In one specific case of bribery of a foreign public
official, Greek authorities “failed to open a domestic
investigation” for almost two years after first discovering it,
the OECD group said in a report published today. The case raises
“grave concerns because of apparent inaction,” it said.  The 69-page report is the latest from an international
organization calling on Greece to improve administrative
practices as the country’s politicians grapple with the demands
of an European Union-led bailout. The so-called troika of
representatives from the  European Central Bank , the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Commission is
preparing a report on the nation’s recovery plan that may be
published next month.  The Paris-based OECD said that tackling foreign bribery is
a particular concern in Greece because of the size of its
shipping industry. Greece controls about 16 percent of the
global maritime freight tonnage, more than any other country,
according to OECD estimates.  The shipping industry is “susceptible to bribe
solicitations by foreign officials, especially in the form of
facilitation payments,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
