The Dubai Financial Services
Authority, the regulator of Dubai’s tax-free financial center,
said Dubai’s ruler had  enacted two laws  that alter some
provisions of the center’s markets law and regulatory law.  The Markets Law 2012, which replaces the Markets Law 2004,
brings about a number of changes including modifications to
prospectus disclosure, DFSA said in an e-mailed statement today.
A prospectus now requires formal approval by the DFSA before an
offer of securities can be made to the public, it said.  The new law also changes provisions relating to what
activities constitute an offer, market misconduct provisions and
corporate governance, according to the statement. The Regulatory
Law Amendment Law 2012 allows the DFSA to undertake regulatory
oversight of auditors within the DIFC, according to the
statement.  The Dubai International Financial Center opened in 2004 to
attract international banks, asset managers and insurers and is
home to the regional offices of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Standard Chartered Plc. (STAN)  The center also has a
stock exchange and is governed by its own laws that seek to
match regulatory standards in developed markets.  The amendment to the regulatory law also alters the
recognition powers of the DFSA with respect to cross-border
trading, according to the statement. The new laws come into
force July 5, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
