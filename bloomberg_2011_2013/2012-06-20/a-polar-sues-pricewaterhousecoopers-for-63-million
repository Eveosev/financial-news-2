Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR) , a Chilean
department-store operator, sued its former auditor for failing
to detect accounting irregularities that forced it to seek
bankruptcy protection last year.  La Polar filed today in Santiago a civil suit against the
local unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in which it seeks 31
billion pesos ($63 million) in damages as it failed to discover
that the company’s previous management was unilaterally
renegotiating debt with customers, as a way to reduce provisions
and increase profits.  “A diligent analysis would have been enough” to detect
the fraud, La Polar said today in an e-mailed statement.  PricewaterhouseCoopers responded that it didn’t receive all
of the information required to detect irregularities.  “The company, through its executives, designed a system to
deceive the market and its external auditors,” the auditing
firm said in an e-mailed statement today in response to the
lawsuit.  La Polar shareholders approved June 11 selling as much as
750 million new shares to raise about 120 billion pesos to fund
operations and pay compensation to clients affected by the
renegotiations.  La Polar filed for  bankruptcy protection  in July and
reported a 583 billion-peso net loss last year when its share
price plummeted 91 percent. The stock has gained 10 percent in
the year to date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
