South Korea’s won and the  Philippine
peso  rose on speculation central banks will roll out more
stimulus that may spur demand for emerging-market assets. Most
other Asian currencies were little changed.  With U.S. inflation below a 2 percent target the  Federal
Reserve  may announce new steps to boost growth when a two-day
meeting ends today, according to 12 of 21 primary dealers who
trade with the central bank. Euro-area leaders at the Group of
20 summit pledged yesterday to “take all necessary policy
measures” to defend the currency union, according to a final
statement issued at the conclusion of a gathering in Mexico.  “There’s growing speculation about the Fed’s stimulus as
the deepening Europe crisis is negative for the  U.S. economy ,”
said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center for
Economic Research in Tokyo. “Such speculation is supportive for
stocks and emerging-market currencies.”  South Korea’s won appreciated 0.5 percent to 1,151.10 per
dollar in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Philippine peso advanced 0.4 percent to 42.110 and Taiwan’s
currency traded at NT$29.878 compared with NT$29.890 yesterday.  Taiwan’s dollar earlier strengthened to the highest level
in more than two weeks ahead of a policy review tomorrow, when
the central bank will probably hold the benchmark  interest rate 
at 1.875 percent, all 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
predicted.  Taiwan Exports  Premier Sean Chen is considering measures to boost private
investment and expand projects to build roads and railways,
according to a government statement yesterday.  Official data showed today Taiwan’s export orders dropped
3.04 percent in May from a year earlier, a third straight
contraction. The median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 3.7 percent slide.  The won reached a five-week high as the Kospi Index and
other regional benchmarks tracked gains in U.S. stocks.  South
Korea ’s Vice Finance Minister Shin Je-Yoon said yesterday that
market volatility will remain high for “some time” and that
global consensus is needed on controlling capital flows.  The Fed could announce today that it will extend Operation
Twist, a $400 billion program involving the sale of short-
maturity debt and the purchase of longer-term bonds, or a third
round of quantitative easing.  Spain’s 10-year bond yields surpassed 7 percent this week.
The government sold 12-month bills at an average yield of 5.074
percent yesterday, 2.1 percentage points more than the 2.985
percent paid on May 14.  “Everyone is digesting the G-20 meeting; markets recognize
this is the start of a process and the challenges in resolving
 Europe ’s crisis still remain,” said  Philip Wee , a Singapore-
based senior currency economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. “The
market is deciding between QE3 or extending Operation Twist.”  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit traded at 3.1585 per dollar,
compared with 3.1575 yesterday, and Indonesia’s rupiah was at
9,443 versus 9,467. Thailand’s baht dropped 0.3 percent to 31.48
and China’s  yuan  weakened 0.08 percent to 6.3599.  To contact the reporters on this story:
