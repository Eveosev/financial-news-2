Hungary ’s talks with the
International Monetary Fund about a loan will probably be
“tortuous” as the government may be reluctant to agree to the
fund’s conditions,  Capital Economics  said.  The government and the fund may disagree on economic policy
issues, such as a flat-rate income tax, prolonging the
negotiations,  William Jackson , an emerging-markets economist at
London-based Capital said in an e-mailed note today.  The forint and Hungarian debt have rallied in the past week
after the government said it will amend a disputed law on the
central bank to remove an obstacle for talks to begin. Hungary
requested aid from the IMF and the European Union in November
after its  credit rating  was cut to junk and the forint fell to a
record low against the euro.  “Our view is that the government will only reluctantly
concede ground when forced to by financial market strains,”
Jackson wrote. “The recent rally in Hungary’s financial markets
will have reduced the government’s incentive to make further
concessions.”  The forint has been the world’s best performer in the last
five days, gaining 3.1 percent against the euro, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The extra yield on Hungary’s
international bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell 4 basis points to
548 basis points today, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global index
shows.  The cost of insuring the nation’s government debt against
non-payment for five years using  credit-default swaps  declined
30 basis points to 534 in the past week, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
