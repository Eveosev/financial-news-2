Peru’s government will boost
investment in public works as part of a third round of economic
stimulus to protect the Andean nation from slowing global
growth, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said.  Two thirds of the 2 billion-sol ($758 million) package will
be spent on public works in progress and maintenance projects,
Castilla said in an e-mailed statement today. The government
will also extend a program of purchases from small businesses
and a credit guarantee scheme for non-commodity exporters, he
said.  The government is stepping up outlays after the economy
expanded at the slowest pace in more than two years in April and
exports fell 12 percent. Stimulus measures announced in
September and October are worth close to two percentage points
of gross domestic product, Castilla said March 21.  “The international environment remains very uncertain and
we want to provide a fiscal stimulus in a preventive manner,”
Castilla said. The government seeks to implement all the
stimulus measures announced to date before the end of the year,
he said.  The economy likely grew by more than 5 percent in May from
a year earlier, after expanding 4.4 percent in April, Castilla
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
