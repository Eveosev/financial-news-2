Tai Hui, the Singapore-based head of
Southeast Asian economics at Standard Chartered Plc, comments on
the outlook for investment in China today on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt.  On the  property market :  “We are seeing a correction in the property market around
China and we don’t think the government will let loose on some
of the tightening grips that we’ve seen in the past two years.
The reality is, while many people have invested in the property
market, many of them have not. So the affordability issue is a
significant social issue, and as a result the government has
been very keen to clamp down on speculation in the real-estate
sector.”  “One of the definitions of a bubble, you do need over-
leveraging. And I think if you look at the average homeowner in
 China , they are not over-leveraged.”  On the banking sector:  “The government does have firepower to recapitalize the
banks if they choose to.”  “Foreign exchange reserves have been used in the past to
recapitalize the banks, that’s one way of doing it. But, of
course, if you look at the fiscal position of the Chinese
government, especially the central government, they’re still
actually in very, very strong shape.”  On government debt:  “We’ve all heard about the local government-debt issues in
the past several years. And, even if that problem does manifest
itself in a much more negative way, the central government debt-
to-GDP ratio would only rise to 78 or 80 percent. So, in that
sense, these are expensive problems but affordable problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
