Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s audience in the U.S.
declined in May while the amount of time users spent on the
social-networking website rose, according to  ComScore (SCOR)  Inc.  The number of visitors to Facebook.com dropped less than 1
percent to 158 million in May from April, Reston, Virginia-based
ComScore said in an emailed statement. Visitors in April also
fell less than 1 percent from March.  The average amount of time visitors spent on the site rose
less than 1 percent to 381 minutes in May from a month ago,
ComScore said. That came after a decline of 3.1 percent in the
previous month.  Facebook, owner of the world’s most popular social-
networking service, gets about half of its  revenue  from the U.S.
and Canada. The company, which held its initial public offering
last month, is depending on a combination of increasing
engagement on the site and new users to help woo advertisers.  Shares of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook fell 1
percent to $31.60 at the close in  New York . The stock has
declined 17 percent from the IPO price of $38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
