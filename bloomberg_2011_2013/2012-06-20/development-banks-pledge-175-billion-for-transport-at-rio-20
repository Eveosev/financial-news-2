The  Asian Development Bank  and seven
other multilateral lenders will provide more than $175 billion
to improve transportation in developing countries over the next
10 years.  The pledge to fund loans and grants is intended to help
build more “environmentally-friendly, accessible, affordable,
and safe transport solutions,” the ADB said in a statement
prepared for an announcement planned today at the Rio+20 United
Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro.  Developing countries are experiencing more congestion, air
pollution and traffic accidents, ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda
was cited as saying in the statement. Global carbon dioxide
emissions from the transport sector are projected to jump almost
50 percent by 2030 and losses from congestion amount to 5
percent of gross domestic product in many Asian nations, the
Manila-based bank said.  “The amount being suggested is for all transport operations
by our organizations,” Tyrrell Duncan, director of the ADB’s
transport and communications division, said in an e-mail today.
“The resources will increasingly support sustainable transport
interventions in all forms, including public transport systems
and high-quality bicycle and walking infrastructure in cities,
energy-efficient vehicles and fuels, railways and inland
waterways.”  The other multilateral lenders involved are the  World Bank ,
 African Development Bank , CAF - Development Bank of Latin
America, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
the  European Investment Bank , the  Inter-American Development
Bank  and the Islamic Development Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
