Germany ’s  economic expansion  is set
to slow in the course of the year, the  Finance Ministry  said in
its monthly report, citing weaker indicators.  German tax revenue fell 4.3 percent in May from a year
earlier, hurt by changes in tax collection that’s delaying
inflows by several months, the ministry in Berlin said in the
report published today. Tax revenue in the first five months
rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
