Florida State University  won 4-1 to
oust the second-seeded University of California,  Los Angeles  in
the men’s College World Series.  The Seminoles will be eliminated if they lose to Arizona
(2-0) in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament
tomorrow in Omaha, Nebraska.  Sherman Johnson and James Ramsey gave Florida State a 2-0
lead in the first inning last night as both scored on bases-
loaded walks. Johnson scored another run on Jayce Boyd’s bunt
single and Devon Travis reached home on an error in the fourth
inning.  Kevin Williams scored on Cody Keefer’s single in the sixth
inning for UCLA.  Tonight, Kent State plays two-time defending champion South
Carolina in an elimination game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
