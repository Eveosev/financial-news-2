Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , owner of the largest
U.S. Web portal, said Rich Riley, executive vice president for
the Americas, is leaving amid management turnover at the
company.  Riley will stay for the next few months during a transition
period, Dana Lengkeek, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said today in an
e-mail. Riley, who joined the Sunnyvale, California-based
company in 1999, formerly was senior vice president and managing
director of Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa.  The departure comes five weeks after Scott Thompson stepped
down as chief executive officer as a result of misstatements
about his academic record. Ross Levinsohn stepped in as interim
leader after Thompson’s exit, and earlier this week the company
said Google Inc.’s Michael Barrett will join the company as
chief revenue officer.  Riley had been promoted in April under Thompson’s
leadership.  Yahoo rose less than 1 percent to $15.74 at the close in
New York. The  shares  have declined 2.4 percent this year.  Riley’s departure was reported earlier today by the blog
AllThingsD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
