The forint rose to the strongest in
six weeks after the central bank said the government accepted
the recommendations of international lenders regarding a
disputed law blocking aid talks.  Hungary ’s currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 286.6 per
euro by 4:45 p.m. in Budapest, the strongest since May 8. The
cost of insuring Hungarian bonds with credit-default swaps for
five years fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
534 basis points, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government accepted
recommendations by the  International Monetary Fund , the European
Commission and the  European Central Bank  on legal changes
necessary for aid talks to begin, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank said
in an e-mail today. Lawmakers may approve the amendments within
two weeks, state news service MTI reported, citing Mihaly Varga,
the government’s chief negotiator.  “News out of Hungary will be positive in next few weeks,
suggesting that Hungary will outperform on foreign-currency”
markets,  Luis Costa , a London-based emerging-market strategist
at Citigroup Inc., wrote in an e-mail today, referring to the
planned approval of the central bank law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
