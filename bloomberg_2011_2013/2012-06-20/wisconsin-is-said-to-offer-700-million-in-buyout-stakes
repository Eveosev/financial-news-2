State of Wisconsin Investment Board,
manager of the ninth-largest public pension plan in the U.S., is
seeking to sell about $700 million in private-equity fund
stakes, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The holdings are mostly from U.S. and European buyout
funds. Some of the positions are in funds run by Blackstone
Group LP,  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , KKR & Co. and London-based
Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP, said the people, who asked
not to be identified because the information is private.  Cogent Partners, an advisory firm based in  New York , is
managing the sale, according to the people familiar. Vicki Hearing, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin investment board,
declined to comment, as did Bill Murphy, a managing director at
Cogent Partners.  U.S. pension plans are tapping the secondary market, where
investors sell their stakes in buyout funds, as they rebalance
their holdings.  California Public Employees’ Retirement System 
and  New York City ’s police, fire and civil-employee pension
plans are selling private-equity stakes to reduce the number of
managers they use and concentrate their investments with the
best performers.  Wisconsin ’s investment board invests on behalf of the
Wisconsin Retirement System, which provides benefits to more
than 572,000 current and former employees of state agencies, the
university system, school districts and most local governments.
Private equity and private debt made up 8.2 percent of the $76.5
billion Core Trust Fund as of April 30, above the system’s 7
percent policy target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
