Hwange Colliery Co. Ltd. (HWANGE) , a
Zimbabwean coal miner, will fire 200 administration and human
resources workers because a new computer program will do their
work in a “paperless” environment, said Fred Moyo, the
company’s managing director  The workers will lose their jobs immediately, Moyo said in
a telephone interview from Harare today before a company board
meeting in the capital. “No one employed in operations has been
affected,” he said.  Hwange, in western Zimbabwe, is Zimbabwe’s biggest colliery
and the main supplier of fuel to Zimbabwe’s state-owned power
utility Zesa Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. The mine has been held back by
ageing equipment and needs about $200 million to recapitalize,
Moyo said May 16.  The company also exports coal to neighboring countries and
 India , and is negotiating to sell to  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
