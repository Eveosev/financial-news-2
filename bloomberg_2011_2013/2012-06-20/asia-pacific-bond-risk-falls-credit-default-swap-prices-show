The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 4 basis points to 176 basis
points as of 8:24 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to  Credit
Agricole SA. (ACA)  The gauge is set for its lowest close since May 8,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 4 basis points to
181 as of 10:25 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices
show. The index is headed for its lowest close since May 11,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index declined 3 basis points to
174 basis points as of 9:38 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index has ranged between 217 basis points and 153
basis points this quarter, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
