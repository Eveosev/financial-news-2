U.K. government ministers will not
watch  England  play in the quarterfinals of the Euro 2012 soccer
championship due to concerns about human-rights abuses in
Ukraine.  After England’s victory yesterday over Ukraine, one of the
two hosts of the tournament, the team is scheduled to play Italy
in Kiev on June 24. Ministers missed the team’s first three
games of the championship, citing worries about “selective
justice” in the country. Prime Minister David Cameron’s
spokeswoman, Vickie Sheriff, said the boycott of Ukraine will
continue.  “It reflects ministers’ busy schedules and widespread
concern about selective justice in the Ukraine,” she told
reporters in London today.  The European Union has demanded opposition leader  Yulia Tymoshenko  be freed from prison, after she was jailed for seven
years over a gas accord she signed with Russia in 2009, when she
was premier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
