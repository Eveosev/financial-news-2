The Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency adopted an interim final rule to amend the lending
limit for national banks under a Dodd-Frank Act requirement.  The rule revises the definition of loans to include
derivative-transaction exposures, repurchase agreements and
securities lending, the OCC said today in a statement announcing
the final rule. Banks and savings associations have to comply by
the end of the year, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
