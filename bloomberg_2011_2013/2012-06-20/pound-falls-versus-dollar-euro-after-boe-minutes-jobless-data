The pound weakened against the
dollar and  euro  after minutes of the Bank of England’s June
meeting showed Governor  Mervyn King  and three other policy
makers were overruled in a push to expand the bank’s bond-
purchase program.  Sterling dropped 0.2 percent to $1.5694 at 9:36 a.m. London
time. It also declined 0.2 percent to 80.84 pence per euro.  A seperate report showed U.K. jobless-benefit claims
unexpectedly rose in May. Jobless-benefit claims climbed 8,100
from April while the median forecast of 20 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a drop of 4,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
