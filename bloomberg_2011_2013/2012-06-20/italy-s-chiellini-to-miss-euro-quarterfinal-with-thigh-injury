Defender Giorgio Chiellini will miss
 Italy ’s European soccer championship quarterfinal against
 England  with a left thigh injury.  Chiellini left Italy’s 2-0 win over Ireland in the second
half two days ago because of the injury. The center-back, who’s
played 53 times for Italy, underwent a scan which showed a
strain, according to team doctor Enrico Castellaci.  “He will certainly miss the game on Sunday,” Castellacci
said on  UEFA’s website . “Obviously in a competition like this
you have to try everything to have him back as quickly as
possible but we will not take any unnecessary risks with his
muscles.”  Italy faces England in Kiev on June 24. Castellacci didn’t
rule the Juventus defender out of the semifinals should Italy
progress.  Chiellini suffered a similar injury May 13 in a Serie A
game against Atalanta and Castellaci said the two injuries
weren’t related. The 27-year-old started all three of Italy’s
group matches. He was replaced by Juventus teammate Leonardo Bonucci against Ireland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
