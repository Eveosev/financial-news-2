Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, sold $2.75 billion of three-year notes, including
the first self-led issue of fixed-rate benchmark debt in seven
weeks.  The bank, which reported a 13 percent rise in first-quarter
profit, issued $2 billion of 1.5 percent fixed-rate bonds that
yielded 115 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries
and $750 million of floating-rate notes at a spread of 92 basis
points to the three-month London interbank offered rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The transaction is the first self-led benchmark sale of
fixed-rate securities in the U.S. since Wells Fargo and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. issued bonds on April 30, Bloomberg data show.
Then, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo sold $1.5 billion of 2.1
percent, five-year debentures at a 130 basis-point spread.  “Of the four largest U.S. banks, we are most impressed
with Wells Fargo from a credit perspective,” wrote James Leonard, a credit analyst in  Chicago  at  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , in a
research note today. “The firm has a clear funding cost
advantage as low-cost deposits fund its entire loan book and
approximately 75 percent of its earnings assets.”  Wells Fargo’s new bonds may be rated A2 by Moody’s
Investors Service, Bloomberg data show.  Benchmark issues are typically at least $500 million. Libor
is the rate at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from
each other.  To contact the reporter on this story:
