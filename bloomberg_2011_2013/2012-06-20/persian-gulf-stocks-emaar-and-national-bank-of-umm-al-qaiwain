percent to 2.99 dirhams before closing at 2.95 dirhams, the
highest close in almost a month. Foreign investors raised their
stake in the developer of the world’s tallest tower to 10.67
percent after buying 6.096 million shares, Al Khaleej newspaper
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  National Bank of Umm Al-Qaiwain  (NBQ UH) surged 10 percent,
the biggest jump since August, to 1.65 dirhams. A Dubai court
suspended the ruling in a case involving the United Arab
Emirates-based lender and Global Investment House KSCC of
 Kuwait , the bank said. The court will hold a session on Sept. 4
to look into NBQ’s appeal. Global said in April 2011 that a
Dubai court ruled in its favor in a $250 million dispute with
NBQ, ordering the bank to pay the amount plus $54.6 million in
interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
