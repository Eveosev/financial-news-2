The dollar fell against the euro to
almost the weakest level in one month amid speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will announce more monetary stimulus at the
conclusion of today’s two-day policy meeting.  Demand for the 17-nation currency was bolstered as leaders
at a Group of 20 meeting pledged to take “all necessary policy
measures” to defend the currency union. A dozen of the 21
primary dealers who trade with the Fed expect some form of
monetary easing. The yen weakened against all of its major
counterparts.  “Markets have been pricing in has been some type of
further easing from the Fed,”  Mark McCormick , a New York-based
currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., said in a
telephone interview. “That’s kind of supported the short-
covering rally we’ve seen, which has supported foreign
currencies against the dollar.”  The dollar weakened 0.2 percent to $1.2706 per euro at
11:26 a.m. New York time, after reaching $1.2748 two days ago,
the highest since May 22. The shared currency added 0.8 percent
to 100.90 yen. The yen fell 0.6 percent to 79.41 per dollar.  Fed Forecasts  The Fed will probably decide to expand Operation Twist
beyond $400 billion to spur growth and buy protection against a
deeper crisis in  Europe , according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists.  Fifty-eight percent of respondents in a June 18 poll said
the Fed will prolong the program, which seeks to lower borrowing
costs by extending the average maturity of the securities in the
central bank’s portfolio. The current program ends this month.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, was little changed at 81.353 after falling as
much as 0.2 percent.  “Any stimulus from the Fed is bearish for the  U.S.
dollar ,” said Kurt Magnus, executive director of currency sales
in Sydney at Nomura Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest brokerage.
“We’re expecting something stimulatory, whether or not it’s in
the form of an extension of Twist, or a little bit of QE,” he
said referring to an earlier program of economy-boosting asset
purchases known as quantitative easing.  Greek Politics  Greek political leaders struck an agreement on a governing
coalition that will seek relief from austerity measures tied to
emergency loans, with New Democracy head Antonis Samaras set to
be the prime minister.  The 17-nation currency rose against the dollar for a second
day following the Greek election result and the country’s steps
toward instating a new government. The euro’s 14-day relative
strength index against the greenback surpassed the 50 level.  A breakthrough at this level suggested “widespread
bullishness,” Eric Theoret, a currency strategist in Toronto at
Bank of  Nova Scotia ’s Scotia Capital unit, wrote in a note to
clients.  In its final statement, the G-20 backed Europe’s plans to
consider a more integrated banking industry with common  deposit
insurance , a step that German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has
resisted. With attention shifting to a summit of European Union
leaders in Brussels on June 28-29, the G-20 supported EU plans
for closer economic union “that lead to sustainable borrowing
costs.”  Euro Trend  The euro is down from this year’s high of $1.3487 on Feb.
24, and has depreciated about 6.4 percent in the past 12 months
against a basket of nine developed-market peers, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  The implied volatility for one-month euro-dollar options,
which indicates expected swings in the underlying currencies,
slipped to 10.63 percent. It reached a high of 13.29 percent
last week. While that’s up from 8.25 percent in April, it’s
below last year’s peak of 18.42 in September.  The JPMorgan G7  Volatility Index  was at 10.13. It rose to
11.88 this month from 8.84 in April, the least since November
2007.  The euro is trading within a range of 98.55 yen and 100.93,
and the currency may fall to 95.59 if it breaks below the lower
level, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a note to clients, citing
trading patterns.  A break below 98.55 would “pave the way for a selloff”
taking it to interim support of 97.05 before possibly falling
further to 95.59, according to analysts including  David Sneddon ,
Credit Suisse’s London-based head of technical-analysis
research. Support is an area on a price graph where orders to
buy may be clustered.  The euro touched 95.60 yen on June 1, the lowest level
since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
