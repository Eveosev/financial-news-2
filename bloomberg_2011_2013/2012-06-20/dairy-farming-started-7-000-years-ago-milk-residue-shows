Dairy cattle grazed in Saharan
 Africa  as early as 7,000 years ago, according to a study based
on milk residue found on shards of pottery.  Cave paintings and cattle remains have suggested that
animal farming predated plant cultivation in the once green and
humid area, said  Julie Dunne , the report’s lead author and a
researcher at the  University of Bristol  in  England . The milk
residue findings, published in the journal  Nature  today, confirm
that theory.  East Asians developed dairy farming technology before 5,000
B.C., and may have passed it along to Africa, Dunne said. If
that’s the case, she said the findings might help to paint a
narrative of how and when Asians moved west into Saharan Africa.  “We might get a timeline of migration,” Dunne said in a
telephone interview on June 15.  The researchers used a chemical analysis of milk residues
absorbed into pottery to date early human dairy consumption. The
residues had been processed into products like yogurt and
cheese, which Dunne said explains how people consumed dairy food
at a time when humans were lactose intolerant.  “We knew absolutely nothing about the chronology in
Africa,” Dunne said. “This is really exciting news.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
