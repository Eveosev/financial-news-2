Money-market forward indicators are
signaling that strains in short term dollar funding are easing.  Three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which
represents the rate at which banks say it would cost to borrow
from another, fell  to  0.46760 percent from 0.46785 percent,
where it had held since June 1, according to the British
Bankers’ Association. The Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks
reluctance to lend, rose to 30.6 basis points from 30.1 basis
points yesterday.  The difference between the two-year swap rate and the
comparable-maturity Treasury note yield, known as the swap
spread, narrowed 0.69 basis points to 23.94 basis points. The
gap is a gauge of investors’ perceptions of U.S. banking sector
credit risk as swap rates are derived from expectations for
dollar Libor. Swap rates serve as benchmarks for investors in
many types of debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan
securities.  Predictions in the forward market for Libor-OIS, known as
the FRA/OIS spread, were little change at 32.9 basis points,
according to the second rolling three month contracts.  Overnight index swaps, or OIS, give traders predictions on
where the Fed’s effective funds rate will average for the term
of the swap. The central bank’s target rate is set in a range of
zero to 0.25 percent.  The cost for European banks to convert euro-denominated
payment streams into dollars-based funding via the cross
currency swaps market decreased. The three-month cross-currency
basis swap was 50.96 basis points below Euribor, compared to
51.91 basis points below yesterday.  Euribor-OIS Spread  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, held steady.
The measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another was
little changed at 43 basis points.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S.  commercial paper 
fell $6.7 billion to $1.007 trillion in the week ended June 13,
the second consecutive slide, according to Federal Reserve data.  The price on one-year cross-currency basis swaps between
yen and U.S. dollars was minus 33.6 basis points, from minus 35
basis points yesterday. A negative swap price indicates
investors are willing to receive reduced interest payments on
the yen they lend in order to obtain the needed financing in
dollars.  Foreign-exchange swaps are typically for periods of less
than a year, while cross-currency basis swaps usually range from
one to 30 years. The latter are agreements in which a person
borrows in one currency and simultaneously lends in a different
currency. The trade involves the exchange of two different
floating-rate payments, each denominated in a different currency
and based on a different index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
