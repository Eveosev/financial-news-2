(Corrects index level in fourth paragraph of story that
originally ran June 19.)  Hong Kong stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index snapping a two-day gain, as a surge in Spanish
borrowing costs to a record quashed optimism following
yesterday’s election of pro-bailout parties in Greece.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) ,  Europe ’s largest bank, slid 0.8 percent.
Tsingtao Brewery Co. fell 7.8 percent after a report billionaire
Chen Fa Shu plans agreed to sell 32 million shares in the
beermaker at a discount. Sands China Ltd. rose 2.2 percent on a
CLSA report that Macau gaming revenue rose this month.  “After Greece,  Spain  is another problem we have to
tackle,” said Francis Lun, managing director at Lyncean
Holdings Ltd. “  China’s economy  is performing better than the
government’s expectation. We will expect optimism towards the
markets soon.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell less than 0.1 percent to 19,416.67
at the close after rising 3.3 percent in the previous two
sessions. More than three stocks fell for each that rose on the
49-company gauge. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
mainland stocks fell 0.2 percent to 9,800.23.  Hong Kong’s benchmark index has fallen about 11 percent
from this year’s peak in February amid concern economic growth
is slowing in the U.S. and China, while Europe’s crisis spreads.
Companies on the Hang Seng Index traded at 10 times estimated
earnings on average yesterday, compared with 12.9 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 10.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Hang Seng Index futures expiring this month lost 0.3
percent to 19,402. The HSI  Volatility Index (VHSI)  fell 6.4 percent to
23.00, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.6 percent on
the gauge during the next 30 days.  G-20 Response  The Group of 20 nations is meeting today in Los Cabos,
Mexico. Leaders are focusing their response to Europe’s crisis
on stabilizing the region’s banks, adding pressure on German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to expand rescue measures as Spanish
bond yields surged to the highest since the euro was introduced
in 1999. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut its growth
forecasts when it concludes a policy meeting tomorrow.  “The downside you see today is fairly normal profit-taking
from the expected good news from  Greece ,” said  Alex Wong ,
director at Ample Capital Ltd. “People are very cautious in
this news-driven market and waiting for a clearer signal to act.
The Fed’s meeting this week will be the focus.”  HSBC slid 0.8 percent to HK$66.90. Esprit Holdings Ltd., a
clothier that counts Europe as its biggest market, sank 2
percent to HK$10.04. Cosco Pacific Ltd., which operates a port
in Greece, rose 0.6 percent to HK$10.2, erasing earlier losses.  Tsingtao Brewery fell 7.8 percent to HK$46.60 after a
report that Chen Fa Shu agreed to sell HK$1.5 billion ($193
million) in shares of the Chinese beer maker at a 7 percent
discount from yesterday’s close, according to a copy of the term
sheet obtained by Bloomberg. The sale was reported earlier by
The Wall Street Journal.  Gaming Shares  Casino stocks advanced on a CLSA report that Macau’s
monthly gaming revenue rose 19 percent through June 17 from a
year earlier, compared with CLSA estimate for a 14 percent full-
month gain.  Sands China Ltd. rose 2.2 percent to HK$25.45, while Wynn
Macau Ltd. gained 2.1 percent to HK$17.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
