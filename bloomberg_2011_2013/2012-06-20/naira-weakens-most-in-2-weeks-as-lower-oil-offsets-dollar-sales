The naira fell for the first time in
three days, heading for the biggest retreat in almost two weeks,
as declining oil prices outweighed increased dollar supply from
the central bank and oil companies.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.3 percent to 162.12 per dollar as of 3 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, the most on a closing basis since June 7.  Nigeria ’s bonny light crude declined for a fourth day, down
0.6 percent to $96.33 a barrel from $128.47 a barrel on March
13. Foreign-currency reserves, which rose 13 percent this year,
slipped to $37.277 billion, according to the latest data from
central bank dated June 18.  “Continued drop in the price of oil will affect external
reserves and the ability of the central bank to support the
naira,” Sewa Wusu, a currency analyst at Lagos-based Sterling
Capital Ltd., said by phone today.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $350 million at a foreign-
currency auction today at 155.90 naira per dollar, the Abuja-
based bank said in an e-mailed statement. The regulator sold
$400 million at an auction on June 18, matching the amount  sold 
on June 13, which was the most since Feb. 8.  Brent crude  slid for a third day, declining 0.4 percent to
$95.37 per barrel after a report yesterday showed U.S.
stockpiles fell 550,000 barrels last week. Investors are
awaiting the outcome of a U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy
meeting today.  ‘Global Sentiment’  “The naira current weakness is based on global sentiment
affecting the oil price,” Olivier Vojetta, the London-based
head of research at FM Capital Partners Ltd., wrote in an e-
mailed note today. The naira rebounded recently as “the
government continued to intervene in the market to stabilize the
currency which has seen the first fall in reserves since
March,” Vojetta said.  The naira strengthened 0.9 percent from June 15 to June 18,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. sold about $400 million
in the  interbank market  yesterday, according to an e-mailed note
from  Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) ’s treasury group.  The nation’s  inflation rate  fell to 12.7 percent in May
from 12.9 percent in April, the National Bureau of Statistics
said yesterday, staying above the central bank’s target and
adding to expectations interest rates will remain unchanged at a
 record high  of 12 percent.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic bonds due 2019 fell 2 basis
points to 15.59 percent, according to the June 19 data on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the
nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 fell 10 basis points
to 5.558 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.9275 per dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
