Ethanol futures declined for the
first time this week on concern that the market is oversupplied.  Prices pared two days of gains after an Energy Department
report showed  stockpiles  jumped 2.5 percent to 21.2 million
barrels, the biggest weekly increase since May 18. The glut has
led  Valero Energy Corp.. (VLO) , the third-largest U.S. ethanol
producer, to idle output at its 110 million-gallon-a-year plant
in Albion,  Nebraska , until margins improve.  “You know it’s bad when they’re shutting down,” said
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery slid 2.3 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.089 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have fallen 5.2 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast dropped
2.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.155 a gallon and in the U.S.
Gulf the additive lost 2 cents to $2.135, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  decreased 1.5 cents to $2.125 a gallon
and in  Chicago  the biofuel slipped 1 cent to $2.085.  Production of the biofuel fell 2.2 percent last week to
900,000 barrels a day, the lowest level since May 4 and the
steepest drop since Feb. 24, Energy Department data showed.  The fuel, made from corn in the U.S., is blended with
gasoline to stretch supply and meet federal mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
