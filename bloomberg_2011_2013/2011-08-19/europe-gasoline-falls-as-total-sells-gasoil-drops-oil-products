European gasoline prices fell as
much as $17 a metric ton as Total SA sold barges of the motor
fuel. Gasoil also declined on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange, following crude futures lower.  Light Products  Eurobob gasoline for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded from $946 to $961 a metric ton, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board.
Yesterday’s transactions were completed from $963 to $993.  Total and Mabanaft BV were sellers, while Gunvor Group
Ltd., Statoil ASA and Vitol Group bought. Barges of Eurobob, to
which ethanol is added to make the finished grade, typically
trade in lots of 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , grew for a
fifth day to $7.59 a barrel versus $7.22 a barrel the previous
session, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude
and refined products broker in London. That’s the most in more
than two weeks.  U.K. motorists are set to miss out on this month’s slide in
the cost of gasoline as retailers hold off cutting prices to
boost profit margins, according to the Retail Motor Industry
Federation’s petrol division, the U.K.’s independent gas station
operators’ industry group. Bulk gasoline fell 13 percent in
early August while U.K. pump rates, including tax, rose 1.1
percent in the first two weeks of the month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Retailers, having been bludgeoned by very low margins and
given the opportunity to reserve some margin to satisfy their
banks and satisfy their shareholders, will take the opportunity
to do that,” Brian Madderson, chairman of the Retail Motor
Industry Federation’s petrol division, said in a phone interview
from  London .  Naphtha’s discount to Brent shrank for the third day to
$3.22 a barrel, compared with $3.71 yesterday, according to PVM.
That’s the smallest gap since May 11, when the spread was $2.66.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for September dropped $7.25, or 0.8 percent, to
$904.25 a ton as of 12:09 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange,
while the October contract was at $900.50. Brent for October
slipped 0.3 percent to $106.66 a barrel.  The heating fuel’s crack, a measure of refining
profitability, grew to $14.49 a barrel, versus $14.30 a barrel
at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, according to ICE data.  Refinery  Preem AB,  Sweden ’s largest refiner, will halt its
Gothenburg refinery at the start of September for maintenance,
Thomas Oegren, a company spokesman, said today by telephone from
 Stockholm .  The work will last most of September, he said. The refinery
can process 125,000 barrels a day of crude oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
