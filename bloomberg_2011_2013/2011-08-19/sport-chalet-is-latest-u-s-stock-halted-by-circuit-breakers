Sport Chalet Inc. (SPCHB)  is the latest U.S.
stock halted by circuit breakers implemented in June 2010.  The curbs were created after the 20-minute rout on May 6,
2010, erased $862 billion from the value of U.S. shares before
prices rebounded. New rules proposed by exchanges on April 5,
2011, would shift the market to a limit-up/limit-down system
that prevents shares from moving more than a certain amount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
