DnB NOR ASA (DNBNOR) ’s Chief Executive
Officer Rune Bjerke said he expects current market turmoil won’t
lead to a new economic crisis,  Dagens Naeringsliv  reported,
citing the executive.  Strong growth in developing economies including  China ,
improved  crisis management  and low  interest rates  will help to
avoid a new economic crisis, Bjerke told the Oslo-based
newspaper.  DnB,  Norway ’s largest bank, last week had steady access to
funding throughout a period of reduced liquidity, DN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
