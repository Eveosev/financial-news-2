Centuries from Ian Bell and  Kevin
Pietersen  helped England reach 457-3 on day two of the final
cricket Test against India.  Bell was 181 not out at stumps at the Oval in London, while
Pietersen scored 175 before being caught by bowler Suresh Raina.
They shared a 350-run partnership for the third wicket following
captain Andrew Straussâ€™s dismissal for 40 by Sree Sressanth.  England resumed today 75-0 after rain prevented any play
yesterday after lunch and lost Alastair Cook for 34 on the fifth
ball. Night-watchman  James Anderson  has scored three.  England leads the four-match series 3-0 and has guaranteed
its place as the No. 1 team in the International Cricket Council
Test rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
