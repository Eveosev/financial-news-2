EDF Energies Nouvelles SA (EEN) , a French
renewable-power developer, agreed to upgrade the Shiloh wind
farm in  California  and sell power from the 100-megawatt facility
to Pacific Gas & Electric Co.  EDF Energies’  EnXco Inc.  unit will boost output from the
wind park in Solano County by removing turbines from the initial
25-megawatt project built in 1989 and installing more-efficient
models, EnXco said yesterday in a website  statement . Pacific Gas
& Electric, a unit of California’s biggest utility,  PG&E Corp. (PCG) ,
will buy the power generated as part of a 25-year accord.  “Repowering older projects is increasingly an important
part of our project development portfolio as legacy projects of
California built in the 1980s reach the end of their efficient
life,” Mark Tholke, vice president for EnXco’s southwest
region, said in the statement.  The project will be completed by the end of 2012 and may
power about 40,000 homes, according to San Diego-based EnXco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
