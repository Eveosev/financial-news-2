Taiwan’s export-order growth
accelerated in July as sales to  China  rose and an earthquake-
induced slump in Japanese demand eased.  Orders, an indication of shipments in the next one to three
months, climbed 11.12 percent from a year earlier, after a 9.18
percent gain in June, the  Ministry of Economic Affairs  said in
Taipei today. The median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey was for an 11.04 percent advance.  Taiwan’s government yesterday reiterated a forecast for
export growth of about 15 percent this year, signaling it
expects shipments to weather faltering U.S. and European
recoveries. The island’s central bank raised  interest rates  for
the fifth straight quarter in June even as economic expansion
cooled, extending its fight against a surge in  home prices .  “While the U.S. and  Europe  are struggling, demand for
electronics parts and petrochemical goods from China and
 Southeast Asia  is making up for the softness in the advanced
economies,” Kevin Wang, an economist at Grand Cathay
Services Corp. in Taipei, said before the release.  The monetary authority will probably raise borrowing costs
in September from the current level of 1.875 percent before
pausing to assess global risks, he said.  The Taiex stock index slumped 3.6 percent today before the
release, as equity markets plunged worldwide on concern global
growth is weakening. The  Taiwan dollar  declined 0.3 percent to
NT$29.076 against its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc.  Current Account  Taiwan’s current-account surplus narrowed to $9.02 billion
in the three months through June, a separate report showed today,
compared with a revised $10.73 billion excess in the first
quarter.  The island’s economy expanded 5.02 percent last quarter
from a year earlier. The government cut its growth outlook for
2011 yesterday, saying gross domestic product will climb 4.81
percent, lower than an earlier prediction of 5.01 percent.  The central bank, which sets rates once per quarter, raised
borrowing costs on June 30 by 0.125 percentage point. While
consumer-price growth eased to 1.32 percent in July, the average
price for existing homes in Taipei held near a record last month,
according to property broker Sinyi Realty Co.  The value of export orders advanced to $37.59 billion last
month from $37.36 billion in June, today’s report showed.  Orders from  Japan  fell 8.74 percent in July from a year
earlier, after declining 15.94 percent in June. Demand from
China and  Hong Kong  combined increased 6.51 percent, after
rising 4.78 percent. Purchases from the U.S. climbed 16.4
percent, compared with a 16.52 percent gain in June.  Orders for electronics rose 0.73 percent in July from a
year earlier, following a 2.62 percent increase the previous
month. Demand for information technology and communications
products climbed 21.79 percent, after rising 11.85 percent in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
