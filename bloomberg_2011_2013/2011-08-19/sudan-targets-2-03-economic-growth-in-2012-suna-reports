The Sudanese government expects the
economy to expand 2.03 percent next year, state-run SUNA  news
agency  reported late yesterday, as the government announced
guidelines of the 2012 budget.  Sudan will increase its exports such as gold, cotton, gum
Arabic and sesame as it tries to compensate for revenue it lost
when South Sudan seceded in July and assumed control of 75
percent of the country’s former daily oil production of 490,000
barrels, Khartoum-based SUNA cited cabinet spokesman Omar
Mohamed Saleh as saying.  The economy will grow 3 percent this year, Finance Minister
Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul said on July 19, less than the original
budget’s target of 5 percent. The government will try to keep
the inflation rate below 17 percent, the news agency said,
citing Saleh.  To contact the reporters on this story:
