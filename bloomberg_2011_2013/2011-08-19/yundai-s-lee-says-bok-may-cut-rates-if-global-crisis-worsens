Lee Sang Jae, a senior economist at
Hyundai Securities Co. in  Seoul  comments on the Bank of  Korea ’s
monetary policy and the global economy. He spoke by telephone.  On interest rate policy:  “The Bank of Korea will likely keep a neutral stance on
its monetary policy for a significant period of time as  South
Korea  is very sensitive to external conditions.  “The BOK will probably keep a neutral stance on its
monetary policy for a significant period of time as South Korea
is very sensitive to external conditions.  “It will be difficult for the BOK to cut rates now due to
high inflation, and it would refrain from raising them for a
significant period of time.  “The BOK would consider cutting rates if the global crisis
materializes.”  On the global economy:  “The U.S. and global economies now really depend on how
the European debt crisis is going to evolve.  “The eurozone isn’t likely to fall into a bigger crisis as
Spain and  Italy  have good fundamentals and its policy makers
would take more action if things get worse.  “The South Korean economy would slow due to the global
turmoil, but grow relatively steady thanks to exports to
developing markets.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
