Malawi’s annual inflation rate
increased to 7.4 pecent in July from 7 percent in the previous
month, the  National Statistics Office  said.  “Although food inflation went down by 2.4 percent, its
impact has not been strong enough to halt the turnaround in
headline inflation,” the Zomba-based agency said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
