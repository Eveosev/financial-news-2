The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m.  New York  time.  The IPC  index  fell 0.3 percent to 33,136.89.  Food retailers: Mexico’s economy expanded 3.3 percent in
the second quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace since
the last three months of 2009 when it contracted 2 percent, as
agriculture and mining contracted, the national statistics
agency said.  Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB (COMERUBC)  , the
Mexican supermarket chain that defaulted on debt in 2008, fell
2.2 percent to 18.32 pesos.  Organizacion Soriana SAB (SORIANAB)  , Mexico’s second-
largest grocery store chain, slipped 1.7 percent to 28.30 pesos.  Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB  (ASURB MM), the
operator of airports in southern Mexico, fell 2 percent to 64.59
pesos. The company had its recommendation cut to “neutral”
from “overweight” at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which cited lower-
than-expected air traffic in Mexico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
