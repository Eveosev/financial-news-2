Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency this year together with Suriname’s
dollar, headed for a fifth week of declines against the dollar
on companies’ demand for the U.S. currency to pay for bills.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
depreciated 0.1 percent to 2,775 per dollar at 4:06 p.m. in the
capital,  Kampala , extending its drop this week to 0.4 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shilling reached
2,817.5, the weakest intraday level since 1993, on Aug. 12.  “Some big companies have covered dollar-related demands,”
Denis Mashanyu, a currency trader at Standard Chartered Bank
Uganda Ltd., said today by phone from Nairobi, the capital of
neighboring  Kenya . The shilling remains under pressure because
of low dollar inflows, creating “negative sentiments” in the
market, he said.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy has
declined 17 percent this year, matching a drop in Suriname’s
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A surge in food
and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more than 18-year high of
18.7 percent in July from 15.7 percent in June.  Uganda is on the cusp of an oil boom with Tullow Oil Plc,
the U.K.-based energy company, expected to start pumping crude
and gas from the Lake Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an
estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil, with about 1 billion
barrels in proven reserves, according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
