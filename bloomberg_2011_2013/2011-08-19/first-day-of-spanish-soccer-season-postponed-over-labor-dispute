The opening round of games in
Spanish soccer’s top two divisions was postponed by a player’s
strike after talks over a new labor agreement broke down.  The players’ association, known as AFE, and the
professional league, known as LFP, failed to reach an agreement
that includes guarantees for unpaid salaries from clubs in
financial trouble at a meeting today in Madrid, the league said
in a statement on its  website .  The will meet again tomorrow, when the season was supposed
to begin, and on Aug. 22.  “The situation continues to be as difficult as it was
before so we’ll have to keep on working in order to find an
accord,” Juanjo Montaner a spokesman for AFE said in a
telephone interview today. “It’s too early to say whether the
second game of the season will be played next weekend, but at
least the league has now started to hear our requests, which is
a small step further compared with our previous meeting.”  Players said Aug. 11 they’d strike the first two weeks of
the season if there was no agreement, a move the league called
“absolutely unjustified.” If the second week of the season is
postponed, the earliest it could begin is Sept. 10 because of a
break in two weeks for international matches.  No one at the league was available for comment when
contacted by telephone today.  Among the games postponed this weekend are three-time
champion Barcelona at Malaga and Real  Madrid  hosting Athletic
Bilbao.  To contact the reporter on this story:
