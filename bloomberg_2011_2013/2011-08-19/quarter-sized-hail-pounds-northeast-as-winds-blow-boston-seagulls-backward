Lightning and hail pounded  Boston ,
where winds gusting as high as 60 miles an hour blew seagulls
backward into buildings, as thunderstorms snarled air traffic
along the Northeast coast.  A severe thunderstorm watch is in effect from Massachusetts
to Delaware, the  National Weather Service  said. Downed trees and
large hail have been reported from Massachusetts to Michigan,
according to the U.S. Storm Prediction Center in Norman,
Oklahoma.  The watch area includes  New York City , which is under the
alert until 9 p.m.  Quarter-sized hail pounded the windows of downtown Boston
high-rises as the storm, moving about 10 mph, stuck shortly
before 3 p.m.  “This is a dangerous storm,” the weather service said.
“If you are in its path prepare immediately for damaging winds,
destructive hail and deadly cloud-to-ground lightning. People
outside should move to a shelter preferably inside a strong
building but away from windows.”  Air traffic was delayed in Boston,  New York , Newark,
Philadelphia and Baltimore, according to the  Federal Aviation
Administration .  To contact the reporter on this story:
