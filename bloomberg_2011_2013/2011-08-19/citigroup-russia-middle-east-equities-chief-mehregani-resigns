Citigroup Inc. (C)  said Farhang Mehregani, equities chief for Russia,  South Africa  and the
Middle East, has left the bank.  Edwina Frawley-Gangahar, a spokeswoman for the bank in
London, confirmed his departure without providing any details.
Mehregani didn’t return calls to his mobile phone.  The banker oversaw a hiring expansion by New York-based
Citigroup over the past year in Russia, South Africa, Dubai and
New York. The research, sales and trading hires came from
competitors UBS AG, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Troika Dialog
and other rivals and included equities team leaders in London,
New York, Moscow and Johannesburg, Mehregani said last year.  Citigroup is the eighth-biggest organizer of equity sales
in  Russia  and Eastern Europe so far this year, after ranking
sixth in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mehregani, who previously ran Citigroup’s trading risk for
global equities, was named head of equities for central and
eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa in July 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
