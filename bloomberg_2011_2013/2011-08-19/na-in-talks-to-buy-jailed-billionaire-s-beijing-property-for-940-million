HNA Group , controlled by China’s
Hainan provincial government, said it is in talks to buy a
commercial property in Beijing owned by  Gome Electrical
Appliances Holdings Ltd. (493) ’s jailed founder  Huang Guangyu .  Final agreement has not been reached on the purchase, Tong
Fu, an HNA Group spokesman, said by phone today. Sina.com
 reported  yesterday that HNA has agreed to buy the property for 6
billion yuan ($940 million). Wang Yongzeng, spokesman for
Huang’s Pengrun Investment Co. said he is not aware of a sale.  A deal would give HNA Group, the largest shareholder of
Hainan Airlines Co., China’s fourth-largest carrier, the Gome
Shangdu property with 550,000 square meters (5.9 million square
feet) of construction area in southwest Beijing. The company,
which also runs airports and hotels, partnered with Bravia
Capital earlier this month in an agreement to buy shipping-
container lessor GE Seaco for $1.05 billion.  Huang, also known as Wong Kwong Yu, is serving a 14-year
jail term after being charged with bribery and insider trading.
He won a boardroom battle with Gome’s previous chairman  Chen
Xiao  from prison earlier this year to reassert his influence.
Gome is China’s second-biggest electronics retailer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
