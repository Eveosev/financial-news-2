The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
dropped a second day, retreating 516.10, or 1.8 percent, to
28,772.76 by 12:57 p.m. in Johannesburg, taking its loss for the
week to 3.5 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.        Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , headed for its
lowest close in almost a year, dropping 8.34 rand, or 3 percent,
to 268.64 rand. Commodities fell, poised for a fourth weekly
loss, on concern slower economic growth will weaken demand. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell as much as
1.7 percent to the lowest level in more than a week.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, headed for its biggest two-day slide in more than two
years, slumping 7.35 rand, or 3.3 percent, to 217.65 rand.  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  , an iron ore-producing unit of
Anglo American, headed for its lowest close in nearly three
months, falling 6.56 rand, or 1.5 percent, to 431.44 rand.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , Africa’s second-biggest gold
producer, rose for the first time in three days, gaining 1.67
rand, or 1.4 percent, to 120.42 rand. Gold rallied to an all-
time high above $1,850 an ounce, poised for the longest run of
weekly gains since April 2007, as escalating concern the global
economy is slowing drove equities lower and spurred demand for a
haven.  Investec Plc (INVP)  , a private bank and wealth manager
with listings in Johannesburg and  London , fell for a fourth day,
dropping 91 cents, or 2 percent, to 45.29 rand, taking its
losses this week to 8.1 percent. European banks tumbled on
concern firms will struggle to fund themselves and increase
earnings as the region’s sovereign debt crisis strangles
economic growth. The 46-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and
Financial Services Index tumbled 3.3 percent after dropping the
most in two years yesterday.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  , the world’s second-largest brewer
by volume, fell a second day, dropping 2.53 rand, or 1.1
percent, to 236.13 rand. The brewer plans to raise about $12.5
billion of debt to fund its bid to take over Foster’s Group
Ltd., two people familiar with the situation said.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest maker of motor
fuel from coal, headed for its lowest close in more than a week,
declining 3.20 rand, or 1 percent, to 307 rand. Oil fell in  New
York , heading for a fourth weekly drop, as investors bet fuel
demand will falter amid signs of weaker growth in the world’s
biggest crude consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
