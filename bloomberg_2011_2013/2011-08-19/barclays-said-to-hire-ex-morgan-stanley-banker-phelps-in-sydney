Barclays Plc (BARC) , ranked third among takeover
arrangers in Australia this year, hired former Morgan Stanley banker
Toby Phelps to lead its property advisory in the country, said a person
with knowledge of the matter.  Phelps will join as a managing director and head of real estate for
Australia and  New Zealand , the person said, declining to be identified
before the appointment is announced.  Phelps comes from  GreenOak Real Estate , an independent advisory
with offices in London, New York and Tokyo, according to the person. He
was formerly the head of U.K. real estate and European hotel investing
at Morgan Stanley, the person said. A person who answered the phone at
GreenOak in  London  said Phelps no longer works there.  Barclays Capital, the investment banking unit of London-based
Barclays, has advised on $30 billion of acquisitions involving
Australian companies in 2011, trailing Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
