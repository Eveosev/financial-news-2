South Korean  household income  rose
for a seventh straight quarter from a year earlier as an
increase in jobs boosted earnings.  Average monthly income at households gained 4.7 percent to
3.71 million won ($3,432) in the second quarter from a year
earlier after a 3.5 percent gain in the previous three months,
Statistics Korea said in a report today.  The  Bank of Korea  left interest rates unchanged last week
for a second straight month as faltering U.S. and European
growth clouds the outlook for Asian exports. Such risks are
threatening to undermine a South Korean recovery that’s boosted
jobs and wages.  Households’ monthly spending excluding tax and social
security-related payments increased 4.3 percent to 2.3 million
won last quarter from a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
