Zimbabwe sold 131 million kilograms
(288 pounds) of tobacco in the 2011 selling season, below the
industry target, said Andrew Matibiri, chief executive officer
of the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board.  Sales rose from 123 million kilograms sold last year,
Matibiri said in a telephone interview today from Harare, the
capital. The agency had projected sales of 170 million
kilograms. “Clean up” sales for tobacco left over after the
official end of the season will be held on Sept. 20, he said.  “We may have missed the target, but the good thing is that
there was an increase in national output and we recorded an
increase in earnings for the country,” he said. Tobacco
earnings rose to $359 million from $346 million in 2010, he
said.  While tobacco production in the southern African nation is
recovering, it is still below peak levels of about 236 million
kilograms achieved in 2000, before President  Robert Mugabe ’s
Zimbabwe African National Union-Front party sponsored often-
violent seizures of most white-owned farms. Output slipped to a
low of 58.6 million kilograms in 2009. Zimbabwe sells mostly the
flue-cured variety of the leaf.  The average price was $2.74 per kilogram compared with
$2.91 a year earlier, Matibiri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
