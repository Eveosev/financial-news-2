Malaysian  government bonds  rose,
pushing 10-year yields to the lowest this year, after inflation
cooled and concern about slowing global economy diminished the
prospects for higher interest rates.  Ten-year notes capped a four-week rally, the longest
winning streak since January, after the central bank said on
Aug. 17 that the Southeast Asian economy grew last quarter at
the slowest pace since 2009. Consumer prices rose 3.4 percent in
July from a year earlier, easing from a two-year high of 3.5
percent in June.  “It’s safety bids, given that the global economic outlook
has worsened lately,” said Lum Choong Kuan, head of fixed-
income research at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .
“There’s less chance of regional central banks raising  interest
rates  now.”  The yield on  Malaysia ’s 4.16 percent notes due July 2021
dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.63
percent from a week ago, according to Bursa Malaysia, the least
since the government sold the securities in January. The price
rose 0.35, or 3.5 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to
104.35.  U.S. consumer confidence fell this month to the least since
the 2009 recession. Malaysia’s economy expanded 4 percent in the
second quarter, the slowest pace in almost two years.  Bank Negara Malaysia  last raised its overnight rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 3 percent in May, after lifting
it three times in 2010. Policy makers next meet on Sept. 8. The
one-year interest-rate swap fell 28 basis points this month to
3.19 percent.  Ringgit Advances  The ringgit bucked regional trend to advance for a second
week, even as local stocks fell amid a global market rout. The
currency gained 0.2 percent today to 2.9843 per dollar, bringing
this week’s rally to 0.5 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The ringgit could have been driven by corporate flows
because local banks have been selling the dollar quite a lot,”
said Hasdi Mamat, a foreign-exchange trader at Bank Muamalat
Malaysia Bhd. “It may not last given the broader  risk aversion 
in the marketplace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
