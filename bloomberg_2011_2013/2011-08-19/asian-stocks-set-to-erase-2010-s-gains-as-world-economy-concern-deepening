Asian stocks fell, set to erase all
gains by the regional index since the end of 2009, amid signs
the world economy is slowing and concern that Europe’s debt
crisis will damage the banking system. South Korea’s Kospi Index
dropped the most since November 2008.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company, lost
4.1 percent in Sydney after oil and metal prices slumped.
 Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , a surfwear maker that gets almost
half its sales from the Americas, tumbled 26 percent after
annual profit missed analyst estimates and U.S. jobless claims
and consumer prices advanced faster than projected.  Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,  Japan ’s biggest bank by market value,
dropped 1.7 percent in  Tokyo . Markets also tumbled as Morgan
Stanley slashed its outlook for Association of Southeast Asian
Nations members’ stock indexes.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 3.2 percent to 119.22 as
of 7:33 p.m. in Tokyo, set to erase all its gains since the
start of 2010. The gauge is also headed for a fourth straight
week of loss. About 12 stocks dropped for each that advanced on
the index today. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  sank 6.2 percent, its biggest
slump since Nov. 20, 2008.  “Everything that’s going on is just eating away at
investor confidence,” said Matt Riordan, who helps manage
almost $6.6 billion in Sydney at Paradice Investment Management
Pty. “Business confidence is tailing off and global growth
slowing, and Europe’s debt situation appears to be getting worse
and worse without any coordinated policy response. The worst
case is that you go back to a 2008-type financial crisis.”  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 2.5 percent,
extending declines after an earthquake rattled buildings in
Tokyo and triggered a tsunami alert for areas already affected
by March’s record temblor.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 3.5 percent.  Hong
Kong ’s Hang Seng Index dropped 3.1 percent.  Indonesia ,  Singapore  Cut  Indonesia’s Jakarta Composite Index plunged 4.4 percent

by year end to just 1 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index
decreased 3.2 percent as the brokerage cut its outlook on the
MSCI Singapore Index to a 5 percent loss from a 22 percent gain.  Stocks worldwide have plunged in the past four weeks as
concern the U.S. may enter a recession and as an intensifying
European debt crisis evoked memories of late 2008, when credit
markets froze after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 11 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 9.3 percent by the  S&P
500  and 18 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 12.3 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 11.5 times for the S&P 500 and 9.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  ‘Lack of Confidence’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 1.6 percent
today. In  New York , the index tumbled 4.5 percent yesterday on
concern the global economy is slowing and speculation that
European banks lack enough capital. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
plunged 4.8 percent in  London  yesterday, the biggest drop since
March 2009.  “There’s a total lack of confidence in policymakers’
ability to defuse the situation,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-
based strategist for AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages
almost $100 billion. “Fear is breeding fear now.”  BHP Billiton lost 4.1 percent to A$37.50 in Sydney. Jiangxi

Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, and today slid as much as 2.4
percent. Copper swung between gains and losses in London trading
today.  Asian exporters fell today after a report showed the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index
plunged to minus 30.7 this month, the lowest reading since March
2009.  The August gauge exceeded the most pessimistic projection
in a Bloomberg News survey in which the median estimate was for
a reading of 2. Government data also showed more Americans than
forecast filed applications for unemployment benefits last week,
while the cost of living climbed in July by the most in four
months.  Exporters Drop  Li & Fung Ltd., a supplier of toys and clothes to retailers
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., sank 4.7 percent to HK$12.72 in
Hong Kong. Billabong tumbled 26 percent to A$3.82 in Sydney, a
record plunge, after the surfwear maker scrapped an earnings
forecast while reporting full-year net income that missed all
analyst estimates.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) , Australia’s third-biggest
producer of  iron ore , dropped 5 percent to A$5.75 after full-
year profit rose 76 percent, less than analysts estimated.
Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Co., a South Korean
shipbuilder that gets almost half its revenue overseas, plunged
15 percent to 18,150 won amid concern orders will fall as the
global economy slows.  Financial stocks declined following losses in European bank
shares as the chief economist at Sweden’s financial regulator
said his country’s lenders must do more to prepare for a
worsening in Europe’s debt crisis that could freeze interbank
markets and cut off funding.  Financial Shares  Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 1.7 percent to 352 yen in Tokyo. In

among Australia’s four largest banking stocks this year, dropped
4.5 percent to A$19.50 after saying trading income slumped, even
as it reported a 7.7 percent gain in third-quarter profit.  “We have a fear-based, emotional-based market right now,”
Erik Ogard, director of multi-strategy investments at Russell
Investments, which oversees $163.4 billion, said in an interview
with Susan Li on Bloomberg Television’s “First Up.” “There
are real economic things to be worried about, however it’s the
degree of the reaction that we think might just be a little
overdone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
