The U.S. will more than double the
minimum bid on oil leases in the western Gulf of Mexico to take
advantage of pent-up demand as the administration seeks to
reduce the  budget deficit .  The Obama administration will offer the leases on Dec. 14,
in the first auction since the  BP Plc (BP/)  oil spill last year, the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement
said today in a statement.  “This sale is an important step toward a secure energy
future that includes safe, environmentally sound development of
our domestic energy resources,” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar
said in the statement. “Exploration and development of our
Western Gulf’s vital energy resources will continue to help
power our nation and drive our economy.”  The Interior Department  proposes to increase the minimum
bid to $100 per acre from $37.50 for blocks in waters deeper
than 1,312 feet (400 meters).  The U.S. will seek bidders for all available unleased areas
in the Western Gulf off the Texas coast, in depths from 16 feet
to more than 10,975 feet. Oil companies may be able to produce
222 million to 423 million barrels of oil from reservoirs in the
area, according to the statement.  BP, based in London, is the top leaseholder in the Gulf,
followed by  San Ramon , California-based  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , Irving,
Texas-based  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  of The
Hague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
