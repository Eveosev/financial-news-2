Kim Clijsters  has withdrawn from
this month’s  U.S. Open , which she won in 2009 and 2010, due to a
strained stomach muscle, the  United States Tennis Association 
said today in an e-mailed release.  Clijsters, who also won the tournament in 2005, pulled out
of the Rogers Cup in Toronto last week because of the injury,
according to her website. She won the Australian Open in January
and missed Wimbledon with an ankle injury.  Clijsters, 28, said in the USTA’s statement that “two
weeks of rehab was not enough to heal this injury.” The Belgian
is ranked No. 3 on the WTA Tour.  “Now there is nothing else I can do than to rest and have
treatment every day,” Clijsters said in the statement. “If a
gradual approach is not taken, I will relapse in the same
injury.”  The  U.S. Open , the final Grand Slam on the annual tennis
schedule, runs Aug. 29-Sept. 11 at the National Tennis Center in
Flushing Meadows,  New York . The tournament carries a $1.8
million purse for the men’s and women’s singles champions.  “We wish her a full and speedy recovery and look forward
to her return to New York next year,” U.S. Open director Jim Curley said in the release.  -- Editors: Rob Gloster, Michael Sillup  To contact the reporter on this story:
