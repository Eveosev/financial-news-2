Canadian stocks fell, extending a
weekly drop, as banks declined on concern the global economic
recovery is slowing.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canada ’s second-largest lender by
assets, lost 2.7 percent after Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
& Co. cut their U.S. growth forecasts. Penn West Petroleum Ltd.,
a western Canadian energy producer, decreased 3.2 percent as
crude oil headed for its fourth-straight weekly retreat.  Barrick
Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s biggest gold producer, rose 1.3 percent
as the metal extended a record.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index fell 47.72
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,138.99 at 12:46 p.m. in Toronto,
extending its weekly decline to 3.2 percent.  “The market has been reacting to the financial situation
in  Europe  and the global economic slowdown,” Murray Leith, a
 money manager  at Odlum Brown Ltd. in  Vancouver , said in a
telephone interview. The firm oversees C$7.5 billion ($7.6
billion). “We’ve had a big economic slowdown in  North America ,
driven by the  United States .”  The S&P/TSX lost 5.9 percent this month through yesterday
as oil plunged 14 percent. The fuel retreated as data on U.S.
housing and employment and European gross domestic product
reflected a slowing economic rebound. Energy companies make up
26 percent of Canadian stocks by market value, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  In a note to clients today, JPMorgan said U.S. GDP will
increase one-third as much as it had formerly forecast in the
first quarter of 2012. Citigroup cut its 2012 U.S. economic-
growth estimate to 2.1 percent from 2.7 percent.  Banks Decline  The S&P/TSX Banks Index fell to head for its biggest two-
day tumble since May 2009.  TD, which has more than 1,000 U.S. branches, dropped 2.7
percent to C$72.03.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , its bigger rival,
slipped 2 percent to C$49.45.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , Canada’s
third-largest lender by assets, declined 3.2 percent to C$50.80.
 Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , the country’s biggest insurer, lost
1.8 percent to C$12.71.  Peter Routledge , an analyst at  National Bank of Canada , cut
his earnings estimates for the six largest banks after markets
closed yesterday, citing economic pessimism in a note to
clients.  An index of S&P/TSX energy stocks retreated after plunging
4.9 percent yesterday. Penn West dropped 3.2 percent to C$17.74.
 Precision Drilling Corp. (PD) , Canada’s largest drilling company by
market value, declined 3.4 percent to C$11.99 to extend its two-
day slump to 13 percent.  Bankers Petroleum Ltd. (BNK) , an oil and gas
producer with operations in Albania, fell for a sixth day,
sinking 5 percent to C$4.16.  Gold Rises  Gold futures rallied as much as 3.3 percent to head for
their seventh-straight weekly advance as the  U.S. dollar  slid to
a postwar low against the Japanese yen.  Barrick gained 1.4 percent to C$49.98.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the
world’s second-largest gold producer by market value, climbed 2
percent to C$50.46.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW) , Canada’s fourth-
largest precious-metals company by market value, rallied 4.8
percent to C$38.59 as silver jumped as much as 4.8 percent.  RIM gained 6 percent to C$27.03 after  Peter Misek , an
analyst at Jefferies & Co., raised his rating on the stock to
“hold” from “underperform.” RIM could sell its patents for
about $2 billion, Misek wrote in a note to clients. The shares
have soared 11 percent this week, the most since October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
