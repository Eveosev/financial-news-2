Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a second
day as concern the global economic recovery is slowing pummeled
equities worldwide and cooled demand for emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares dropped the most
since Aug. 5 after  consumer confidence  in the U.S. slumped this
month to the least since the 2009 recession. A global slowdown
may disrupt Indonesia’s economic growth, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told lawmakers on Aug. 16. The rupiah has
slipped 0.7 percent this month as international funds sold $548
million more Indonesian stocks than they bought during the
period through Aug. 18, exchange data show.  “All currencies in the region are softer on concern the
global economy is slowing,” said Wiwig Santoso, head of
treasury and markets at PT Bank DBS Indonesia in Jakarta. “Most
of the major equity indexes are in red territory.”  The rupiah dropped 0.1 percent today to 8,563 per dollar as
of 3:30 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was little changed this week. The currency touched
8,570 earlier today, the weakest level since Aug. 10.  Government bonds  gained. The yield on the 8.25 percent
securities due July 2021 fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 6.88 percent this week, according to midday
prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
