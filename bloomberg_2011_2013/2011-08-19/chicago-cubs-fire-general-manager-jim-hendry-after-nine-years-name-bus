The  Chicago Cubs , in fifth place in
the six-team National League Central division, fired General
Manager Jim Hendry after nine years in the position.  Assistant General Manager Randy Bush will fill the job on
an interim basis, the Cubs said today in an e-mailed news
release.  “My family and I appreciate Jim’s dedication during our
time with the Cubs and thank him for his overall 17 years of
service to the Cubs organization,” Chairman Tom Ricketts said
in a statement. “It is time for a fresh approach in our
baseball leadership, and our search begins immediately for our
next general manager.”  Hendry, 56, was promoted to vice president of player
personnel in October 2001 and named GM in July of the following
year. He’ll step down as the third-longest tenured GM in
franchise history.  The Cubs, who haven’t won the  World Series  since 1908, went
749-748 during Hendry’s stint as GM, reaching the postseason
three times. They lost the NL Championship Series in seven games
in 2003 and were swept in the division series in both 2007 and
2008.  Chicago is 54-70 this season, 18 1/2 games behind the
division-leading  Milwaukee Brewers .  The 52-year-old Bush has been the Cubs’ assistant GM for
the last five seasons. He was a two-time World Series winner as
a  first baseman  for the  Minnesota Twins  from 1982-93.  To contact the reporter on this story:
