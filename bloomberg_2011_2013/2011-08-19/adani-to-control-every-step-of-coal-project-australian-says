touches,” including a A$3 billion railway network from its
Galilee Basin mine in central Queensland to two ports, the
company’s Australian operations Chief Executive Jignesh Derasari
told the newspaper in an interview.  The project will make Adani India’s largest single
investment in  Australia , the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
