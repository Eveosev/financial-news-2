Billabong International Ltd. (BBG)  plunged
by a record in Sydney trading after the surf-wear maker scrapped
an earnings forecast when reporting full-year net income that
missed all analyst estimates.  Billabong slumped 26 percent to A$3.82 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of Sydney trading, the biggest decline since it first
started trading in August 2000.  The company scrapped its forecast for earnings-per-share
growth of more than 10 percent this fiscal year as gains in the
Australian dollar slash the value of overseas sales and benefits
from a low tax rate aren’t repeated. Earnings in all three of
its markets fell by more than 10 percent amid natural disasters
in  Japan ,  New Zealand  and  Australia , falling European demand and
the local dollar’s rise against its U.S. counterpart.  “The lack of earnings visibility will weigh on the share
price and there is likely to be double-digit downgrades to
consensus estimates,” analysts at Citigroup Inc. led by Craig Woolford said in a note to clients today. “There is significant
work ahead to restore profitability.”  Net income dropped 18 percent to A$119.1 million ($123
million), or 47 cents a share, in the 12 months ended June, the
Burleigh Heads, Australia-based company said today. That missed
all nine analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg and compares
with an average prediction of A$126.3 million.  Billabong paid an effective  tax rate  of 7 percent in fiscal
2011, compared with 28.5 percent a year earlier. Those tax
benefits won’t be repeated in the current year, it said.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization from the Americas fell 13 percent to A$80.2 million
in fiscal 2011 and profit from  Europe  dropped 22 percent to A$
54.2 million.  The Australasian region that includes its home market
posted a 38 percent Ebitda slump to A$55.2 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
