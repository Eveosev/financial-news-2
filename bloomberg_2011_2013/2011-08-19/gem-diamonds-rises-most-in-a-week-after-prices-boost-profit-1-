Gem Diamonds Ltd. (GEMD) , a producer of the
stones in Lesotho and  Australia , rose the most in nine months in
London trading after reporting record first-half earnings.  Gem Diamonds closed 7.4 percent higher at 195.50 pence, the
biggest increase since November 2010.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization jumped to $90.8 million from $18.5 million a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement.
Attributable profit rose to $28.9 million from $3 million,
driven by higher diamond prices.  “We’ve seen much more demand than we can supply,
especially for very expensive diamonds, which is where we
operate,” Chief Executive Officer Clifford Elphick said in an
interview. “We expect a pause in the rise in diamond prices. It
is unlikely that prices will continue rushing ahead as they’ve
done in the past year. But then it will get back in its upward
phase.”  The mining company plans to start production at its Ghaghoo
project in Botswana in 2013, and the board will decide in
November whether to double capacity at its Letseng mine in
 Lesotho , Elphick said by mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
