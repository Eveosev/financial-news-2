The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  against non-payment pared an earlier
increase, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 7 basis points to 153.5 as of
11:08 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices. Thatâ€™s down from the earlier 11 basis-point
advance today, RBS prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 13 basis points
to 163 as of 1:20 p.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. That would be the highest level since July 2009, according
to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 5 basis points to 139 as
of 12:11 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  --Henry Sanderson, Editor: Edward Johnson, Shelley Smith  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
