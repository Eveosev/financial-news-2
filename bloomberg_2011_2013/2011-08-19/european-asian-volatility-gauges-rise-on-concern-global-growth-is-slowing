Volatility gauges surged worldwide
after  Citigroup Inc. (C)  cut forecasts for U.S. economic growth and
concern intensified that the global expansion is weakening.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, rose 4.1 percent to 44.43 at 9:52 a.m. in New
York. The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of Euro Stoxx 50
Index options, gained 1.9 percent to 48.07 after earlier
advancing as much as 19 percent. Volatility indexes from South
Korea to  Hong Kong  to  India  also increased.  “It’s a confidence crisis,”  Jeffrey Saut , chief
investment strategist at Raymond James & Associates in  St.
Petersburg ,  Florida , said in a telephone interview. His firm
manages $278 billion. “The fear is that we’re going into a
recession and that we have a dysfunctional government.”  Citigroup cut its forecasts for expansion in the world’s
largest economy after Morgan Stanley also lowered its global
growth projection to 3.9 percent from 4.2 percent. Regulators
from the U.S.,  South Korea  and  Sweden  said the market turmoil
posed further risks to growth, after reports yesterday showed
American jobless claims rose and Philadelphia-area manufacturing
shrank by the most since 2009.  The  U.S. economy  may expand less than previously forecast
in 2011 and 2012 because of potential “political paralysis”
and fiscal-tightening steps, Citigroup wrote in a report dated
yesterday. The brokerage cut its 2011 gross domestic product
growth forecast to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent and lowered its
2012 GDP growth estimate to 2.1 percent from 2.7 percent.  European, Asian Stocks  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell 1.7 percent after yesterday
tumbling 4.8 percent, the most since March 2009. The gauge sank
22 percent from this year’s Feb. 17 peak through yesterday amid
concern that Europe will fail to contain its sovereign-debt
crisis and that the economic recovery in the U.S. will falter.  Implied volatility for  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  options with a strike
at the stock price expiring in 30 days rose to a two-year high
of 99.14 after jumping 28 percent yesterday.  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s
implied volatility rose to 81.02 from 76.65 yesterday.  “There were lots of buyers of put protection,” said
Sebastien Krol, a director at Mariana Capital Markets Ltd., a
London-based brokerage firm specializing in equity derivatives.
“That’s really a measure of fear in the market. If the market
goes down and people are buying puts, that’s going to increase
the downside volatility and that suggests there is some panic.”  Asia Volatility  Hong Kong’s HSI Volatility Index jumped 31 percent, the
most in almost two weeks, to 40.18. The Kospi 200 Volatility
Index of South Korea option prices climbed 35 percent to 41.91.
The India VIX, which gauges the cost of buying protection
against losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, advanced 6.3 percent
to 29.19.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks fell 3 percent,
giving it a 2.1 percent loss for the week. The  Hang Seng Index (HSI) 
slid 3.1 percent, while the  Kospi 200 Index (KOSPI2)  tumbled 6.4 percent,
the most since November 2008. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
plunged 4.5 percent yesterday.  “Investors are fearful,” said Khiem Do, the Hong Kong-
based head of multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management,
which oversees about $10 billion. “The U.S. economy, showing
signs of slowing down, has brought down our markets
significantly. Sentiment is bearish, and in times like these,
investors should think about long-term investments.”  The VIX, which gauges the cost of S&P 500 options, jumped
35 percent to 42.67 yesterday for the third-highest close of
2011. VIX futures expiring in September gained 4.3 percent to
34.85 today.  The VIX surged 50 percent to 48 on Aug. 8 for the biggest
jump since February 2007, while the VStoxx climbed to its
highest level since May 2010 on Aug. 10. The volatility
benchmark for U.S. equities has averaged 20.37 in its 21-year
history, and the VStoxx average has been 25.98 since April 1999,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
