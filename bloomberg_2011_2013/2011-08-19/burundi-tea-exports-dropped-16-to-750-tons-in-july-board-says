Tea exports from  Burundi , which
relies on agriculture to generate most of its foreign-currency
earnings, dropped 16 percent in July, the Burundi Tea Board
said.  Shipments declined to 750 metric tons from 895 tons a year
earlier, Remy Ndayininahaze, head of exports at the Bujumbura-
based board, said in an interview today. Export earnings
increased to $2.23 million from $1.92 million, he said.  Cumulative exports in the first seven months of this year
totalled 5,258 tons, compared with 4,780 tons a year earlier,
with income increasing 24 percent to $14.9 million, he said.  Burundi relies on tea and coffee to generate 90 percent of
its foreign-exchange earnings, according to the CIA World
Factbook. Yields in the East African country have fallen from
more than 9,000 tons in 2001 because of an insurgency that
displaced small-scale growers, who account for 80 percent of
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
