Australian stocks fell as concern
deepened that the global economy is slowing and that  Europe ’s
debt crisis will hurt the banking system.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, sank
4.1 percent after commodity prices slumped. National Australia
Bank Ltd., the country’s biggest business lender, slumped 3.3
percent.  Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , the world’s biggest
surfwear maker that gets almost half its sales from the Americas,
tumbled 26 percent after annual profit missed analyst estimates.  “Everything that’s going on is just eating away at
investor confidence,” said Matt Riordan, who helps manage
almost $6.6 billion in Sydney at Paradice Investment Management
Pty. “Business confidence is tailing off, global growth is
slowing and Europe’s debt situation appears to be getting worse
and worse without any coordinated policy response. The worst
case is that you go back to a 2008-type financial crisis.”  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 3.5 percent to
4,101.90 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney, capping a
1.7 percent weekly loss. Earlier this month, the Australian
gauge declined more than 20 percent from its April 2010 peak
after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S.’s credit rating.  New Zealand ’s  NZX 50 Index (NZSE50FG)  sank 0.6 percent to 3,267.84 at
the 5 p.m. close in Wellington. It gained 1.6 percent in the
