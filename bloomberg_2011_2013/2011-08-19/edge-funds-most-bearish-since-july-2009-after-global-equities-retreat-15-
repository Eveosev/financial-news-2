Bearish wagers against global stocks
at  hedge funds  have surged to the highest level since July 2009
as the European debt crisis and reports showing an economic
slowdown cause the biggest losses in almost three years.  An index of hedge fund assets from International Strategy &
Investment Group dropped to 45.8 on Aug. 16, showing the most
short selling in two years, down from a 2011 high of 54.2 in
February. The research firm and broker-dealer surveys 35 hedge
funds with about $84 billion under management every week.  Professional investors are selling after the MSCI All-
Country World Index dropped 15 percent since July 22 and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index posted record swings. Equities fell
yesterday after Lars Frisell, the chief economist at  Sweden ’s
financial regulator, said it won’t take much for interbank
lending to freeze, and data showed the  U.S. economy  is stalling.  “Hedge funds are sensing a European fiscal denouement on
the horizon and they understand that contagion can hit the U.S.
very quickly,” Steve Shafer, who helps manage $300 million as
chief investment officer of Oklahoma City-based Covenant
Investors, said in a telephone interview. “Hedge funds are
pretty nimble traders with a short-term focus, so they’re
protecting what they’ve got and they are preparing for a
potential capitulation of the market.”  Shafer’s hedge fund sold stocks in the past 10 days to
raise cash and reduced its use of borrowed money to pay for
equities, he said yesterday.  ‘Dangerously Close’  Stocks tumbled yesterday after Morgan Stanley said the U.S.
and  Europe  are “dangerously close to recession.” The New York-
based bank reduced its forecast for global gross domestic
product growth in 2011 to 3.9 percent from 4.2 percent. The S&P
500 slumped 4.5 percent, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
posted its fourth loss in August exceeding 400 points.  The index from ISI, based in New York, tracks hedge-fund
investments on a zero through 100 scale. Readings of zero show
“maximum” short selling, the sale of equities with the hope of
profiting by buying them at lower prices later, while 100 means
“maximum” bullish bets. At 50, hedge funds are deploying a
“normal” allocation to short and long investments.  The ratio of bullish to bearish investments in U.S.
equities has dropped to 11.7 from this year’s peak of 13.2 in
May, according to New York-based Data Explorers, which provides
research on short sales and  stock lending . The measure sank to
6.5 in September 2008 after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
bankruptcy spurred the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.  Getting Nervous  “Hedge funds are bringing down their bullish
investments,” Chris Baggini, who manages the long-short Turner
Titan Fund at Berwyn, Pennsylvania-based Turner Investment
Partners Inc., said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees
about $18 billion. “When you are nervous you reduce your long
position first, and when you’ve figured out the direction of the
market, then you can start to beef up the short side.”  Hedge funds, largely unregulated investment vehicles that
aim to make money whether markets rise or fall, are putting
themselves at risk of missing out on gains fueled by takeovers
and earnings growth, said  Uri Landesman , managing general
partner of Platinum Partners LLP.  “Being this short probably doesn’t make sense unless you
think the market is going to set new lows, which at this point I
do not,” Landesman, who helps oversee $1 billion at the New
York-based hedge fund, wrote in an e-mail. “M&A, particularly
in energy, software and biotech, will eventually lead the market
higher, as long as earnings don’t fall apart.”  Profit Forecasts  Profit at  S&P 500  companies is forecast to rise 17 percent
to $99.08 a share in 2011 and 14 percent to $112.90 in 2012,
according to average analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. accelerated stock
purchases on Aug. 8 as the S&P 500 plunged the most since
December 2008, the billionaire investor said during an Aug. 15
interview with  Charlie Rose  on PBS. He bought as this month’s
decline drove the price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 down to
12.2, the lowest since March 2009 and below its average since
1954 of 16.4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “I like buying on sale,” said Buffett, Berkshire’s chief
executive officer. “Last Monday, we spent more money in the
stock market buying than any day this year.”  History shows the S&P 500 may sink after closing at
1,140.65 yesterday, up 1.9 percent from the 11-month low of
1,119.46 reached on Aug. 8. The index plunged 16 percent between
July 25 and Aug. 8. The eight declines of that size over similar
amounts of time since 1928 led to additional losses averaging 17
percent, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group
LLC, a Harrison, New York-based research company.  “It makes perfect sense for hedge funds to take down
risk,” Ryan Bend, who oversees $1.6 billion as  money manager  at
Federated Investors Inc.’s Prudent Bear Fund, said in a
telephone interview from Pittsburgh. “We’ve gotten more
aggressive with our shorts in the past month,” he said. “The
bear case is really about European banks, European sovereign
debt and then contagion effects to the  United States .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
