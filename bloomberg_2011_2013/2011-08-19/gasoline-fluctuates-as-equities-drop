Gasoline fluctuated on speculation
that gasoline may rebound from its lowest level in more than a
week and as equities extended this week’s losses, indicating
lower fuel demand.  Futures traded in a 7.57-cent range as Bank of America
Corp., the biggest U.S. lender by assets, retreated 0.4 percent
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. dropped 0.5 percent at 9:59 a.m. in New
York. Gasoline for September fell 8.71 cents yesterday, the
largest drop since Aug. 8.  “There could be more of a propensity to do a little short-
covering into the weekend, but it’s anyone’s guess where the
market is going,” said  Tom Knight , vice president of trading
and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana,  Texas . “A hard
selloff in the equities would drag us lower.”  Gasoline for September delivery rose 1.92 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.8024 a gallon at 10 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices traded between $2.7435 and $2.8192.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped 0.5 percent to
1,134.75 at 9:47 a.m. in New York. The euro strengthened 0.6
percent against the dollar, boosting the appeal of commodities
priced in the U.S. currency, amid speculation European Union
regulators may push for joint bond sales by nations in the
region to help contain the government debt crisis.  Heating oil for September delivery rose 2.04 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.8952 a gallon on the exchange. Futures slipped as
much as 1.5 percent earlier.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, was
unchanged at $3.585 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
