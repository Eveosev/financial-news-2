Municipal financial advisers in the
U.S. would be barred from making political donations just to win
business under a proposal from the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board.  The new rule would curb advisers from doing business with
state or local governmental bodies, including pensions, within
two years of giving to officials with the authority to hire
them, the board said today. It has asked the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to approve the proposal.  Similar rules on so-called pay-to-play practices already
apply to banks that underwrite bonds in the municipal  securities
market . The proposal is among regulations being applied to
businesses that advise public officials since passage of the
Dodd-Frank financial-services overhaul last year. That law
expanded the board’s authority to include advisers.  “Pay-to-play activities have no place in municipal
finance, and can distort and undermine fairness in the process
by which government business is awarded,” the board’s executive
director, Lynnette Kelly Hotchkiss, said in a statement. The
proposal “will help reduce the undue influence of political
contributions in the selection of municipal advisers.”  An exception lets advisers give as much as $250 in each
election cycle to candidates for whom they can vote. A similar
rule applies to bankers.  The Alexandria, Virginia-based board draws up rules for the
$2.9 trillion municipal-securities market, subject to SEC
approval. In April, the board said it planned to regulate pay-
to-play practices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
