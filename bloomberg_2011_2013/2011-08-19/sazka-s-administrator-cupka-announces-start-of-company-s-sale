The sale of Sazka AS, a bankrupt
Czech lottery company, started today, the bankruptcy
administrator said.  The price offered by bidders will be the main factor in
choosing the new owner of Sazka, Lenka Ticha, a spokeswoman for
Sazka’s bankpruptcy administrator Josef Cupka, said by phone
today.  The Prague Municipal Court approved this week conditions
for a tender to choose a new owner of the state lottery company.
Bidders must provide a deposit of 500 million koruna ($29.6
million) to take part in the tender, according to the rules.  The court put the company into bankruptcy in May. Sazka was
declared insolvent after it breached covenants on bonds issued
to finance the construction of the 02 Arena, which hosted the
World Hockey Championship in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
