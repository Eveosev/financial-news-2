South Korea ’s won fell, capping its
fourth weekly loss, after the financial regulator urged insurers
to boost capital in preparation for a potential crisis and signs
the  U.S. economy  is slowing dimmed the outlook for exports.
Government bonds rose for the first time in four days.  The won led declines in regional currencies today as
Financial Supervisory Service Governor Kwon Hyouk Se asked chief
executives of insurance companies to be cautious in paying
dividends. U.S. reports showed  consumer confidence  is the
weakest since March 2009, existing home sales unexpectedly
dropped in July and jobless claims rose more than economists
forecast last week.  “Global economic uncertainties are a blow to the export-
oriented Korean economy, triggering a reduction in investment in
the region,” said Roh Sang Chil, chief currency dealer with
Kookmin Bank in  Seoul , the nation’s biggest lender. “The risk-
averse sentiment in the market drove the won down.”  The won fell for a third day, declining 1.3 percent to
1,087.55 at the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It lost 0.7 percent this week and today
touched 1,087.73, the lowest level since Aug. 11.  Morgan Stanley cut its 2011 economic growth estimate for
South Korea to 3.8 percent yesterday from 4.5 percent, citing
the risk of a “correction” in consumption. The Kospi stock
index fell 6.2 percent, the biggest slide since November 2008.
Overseas investors sold more of the nation’s stocks than they
bought, as they have done on all but three days in the past
month.  Three-year  government bonds  advanced, pushing their yield
to the lowest level this week. The yield on the 3.5 percent debt
due June 2014 fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point,
to 3.48 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.  The yield on ten-year government bonds fell to 3.84 percent,
a level unseen for benchmark bonds of that maturity since 2005,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
