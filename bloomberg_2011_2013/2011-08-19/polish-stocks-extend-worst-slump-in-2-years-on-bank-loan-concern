Polish stocks tumbled, extending the
biggest slump in two years, on concern banks may face rising
defaults on foreign-denominated  mortgage loans  because of the
slide in the zloty against the Swiss franc.  The benchmark WIG20 Index sank 1.5 percent to 2,215.02 at
10:03 a.m. in Warsaw, extending its decline from a 2011 high in
April to 25 percent. The gauge slumped 5.8 percent yesterday,
the biggest daily drop since June 2009, as industrial output
grew at the slowest pace in 21 months and concern deepened that
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis may lead to funding problems.  “No one knows how deep the economic slowdown will be in
Poland and in the world and what effect it will have on
earnings, and that’s why this big uncertainty makes people sell
stocks,” said Arkadiusz Chojnacki, head of equity research at
Ipopema Securities SA in Warsaw.  BRE Bank SA (BRE) , a unit of Comerzbank AG, fell for a third day,
losing 4 percent to 244 zloty.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL) , controlled by
Banco Comercial Portugues SA, slid 5.4 percent to 4.02 zloty.
 Getin Holding SA (GTN) , the financial-services group controlled by
billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, lost 3.7 percent to 8.05 zloty.  PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest lender, retreated 3.1
percent to 34.2 zloty, its third day of losses.  The zloty weakened for a third day against the Swiss franc,
losing 0.8 percent to 3.7210, raising concern the quality of
Polish banks’ loans will worsen. Franc-denominated mortgages
totaled 151.8 billion zloty ($52 billion) in June, accounting
for almost 53 percent of all home loans in Poland, according to
the country’s financial regulator.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper producer with the biggest
European mine output, declined 1.7 percent to 152.3 zloty,
heading for the lowest close since December.  Kernel Holding SA (KER) ,
the largest sunflower-oil producer in Ukraine, lost 3.7 percent
to 60.7 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , Poland’s second-largest oil
refiner, fell 2.3 percent to 31.52 zloty.  Morgan Stanley yesterday cut its forecast for global growth
this year to 3.9 percent from 4.2 percent, citing an
“insufficient” policy response to Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis, weakened confidence and the prospect of fiscal
tightening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
