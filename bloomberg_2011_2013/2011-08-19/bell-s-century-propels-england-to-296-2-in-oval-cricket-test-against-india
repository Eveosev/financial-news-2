Ian Bell’s unbeaten century helped
 England  reach 296-2 at tea on day two of the final cricket Test
against India.  Bell has scored 114 runs at the Oval in London, while Kevin
Pietersen is 98 not out. England resumed today 75-0 after rain
prevented any play yesterday after lunch.  Alastair Cook was dismissed for 34 by Ishant Sharma and
captain  Andrew Strauss  was out for 40 by Sree Sreesanth.  England leads the four-match series 3-0 and has guaranteed
its place as the No. 1 team in the International Cricket Council
