South  Korea ’s benchmark stock index
fell the most in almost three years and the won slumped on
concern the U.S. economic recovery is faltering and  Europe ’s
debt crisis may spread.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  sank 6.2 percent, the most among Asian
benchmark gauges today, to 1,744.88 in Seoul. The Kospi lost 2.7
percent this week, taking its slump from its May 2 record to 22
percent. The won fell for a fourth straight week, sliding 1.3
percent today to 1,087.55, its biggest decline since Aug. 8. The
Kospi 200 Volatility Index of South Korea option prices climbed
35 percent, the most since Aug. 9, to 41.91.  Exporters led stock declines, which prompted an official at
the Bank of Korea to say investors are “too nervous.”
Citigroup Inc. cut its growth forecasts for the U.S., which
accounted for 10.7 percent of South Korea’s exports last year,
after data yesterday showed jobless claims rose and
Philadelphia-area manufacturing shrank. Lars Frisell, chief
economist at  Sweden ’s financial regulator, said it won’t take
much for interbank lending to freeze.  “There seems to be a growing consensus that a global
economic recovery will take longer than previously thought,
affecting exporters,” said Han Sang Soo, a  fund manager  at
Samsung Asset Management Co. in Seoul, which oversees about $31
billion in assets.  The Kospi has dropped 15 percent this year, pushing
valuations of the 780 member stocks down to 8.7 times estimated
profit, the second-lowest valuation in Asia after Pakistan’s
benchmark gauge, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
MSCI Emerging-Markets Index trades for 9.6 times.  Program-Trading Halt  Korea Exchange Inc. halted program trading of shares on the
nation’s benchmark gauge for five minutes from 1:03 p.m. local
time after Kospi 200 Index futures fell more than 5 percent for
more than a minute.  The rout in global equities this month caused South Korea
to ban equity short sales and the nation’s central bank to keep
 interest rates  unchanged.  South Korean stocks fell today because investors are “too
nervous” about concerns over the global economy and speculation
that European banks lack enough capital, Min Sung Kee, director
general of the financial markets department at Bank of Korea,
said.  “We’re closely watching the markets 24 hours a day and we
need to monitor the U.S. market more closely tonight,” Min said
in a telephone interview from Seoul today.  Samsung, Hyundai  Exporters led declines, with Samsung Electronics Co.,
Asia’s biggest maker of chips, flat screens and mobile phones,
losing 4.1 percent and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s largest
automaker, sinking 11 percent. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the
world’s biggest shipbuilder, tumbled 11 percent.  Refiners tumbled after crude-oil futures posted the third-
largest decline of 2011. SK Innovation Co.,  GS Holdings (078930)  Corp.
and  S-Oil Corp. (010950)  dropped at least 10 percent.  Three-year  government bonds  advanced, pushing their yield
to the lowest level this week. The yield on the 3.5 percent debt
due June 2014 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to 3.50 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
