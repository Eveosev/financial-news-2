Coal imports into  China , the world’s
biggest consumer, jumped 34 percent to a record in July, said
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  Shipments climbed “sharply” from a year earlier to 17.53
million metric tons,  Mark Pervan , an analyst at ANZ in
Melbourne, said in a report today.  China bought more low-quality coal, according to the
report. Imports came to 3.63 million tons for the anthracite
variety, 4.05 million tons for coking coal and 9.85 million tons
for thermal coal, it showed.  Coking coal is used to make steel, while thermal coal is
burned to generate power. China is the world’s biggest steel
producer.  Imports are set to accelerate next month or in October as
utilities start to restock in anticipation of stronger winter
demand, Pervan said. “Signs of a pickup in Chinese activity are
supporting China imported coal prices,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
