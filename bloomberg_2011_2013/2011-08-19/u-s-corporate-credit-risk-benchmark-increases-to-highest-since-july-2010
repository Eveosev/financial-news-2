The cost of protecting U.S.
corporate debt from default rose to the highest level in more
than 13 months as concern grew that the global recovery is
slowing and  Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 1.7 basis points to a
mid-price of 118.7 basis points as of 11:19 a.m. in New York,
according to Markit Group Ltd. That’s the highest since July 6,
2010. Perceived credit risk worsened for Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Citigroup Inc.  The gauge typically rises when investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. The index surged 7.3
basis points yesterday as the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index
fell 4.5 percent. Traders pushed the index 2.4 basis points
higher this week after reports showed the U.S. recovery
faltering and the European debt crisis spreading. The index has
climbed from 96.3 at the end of July.  “You’ve got a financial crisis going on across the
globe,” said  Joel Levington , a managing director of corporate
credit at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York.
“The continuance of risk-off trade,” in which traders
gravitate to the safest investments, has been a theme for credit
markets this week, he said.  Credit-default swaps on New York-based Goldman Sachs rose
4.5 basis points to 209.8, according to data provider CMA, which
is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. Contracts on Citigroup Inc., also
based in New York, climbed 4.2 basis points to 210 basis points,
CMA data show.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meets its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting
$10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
