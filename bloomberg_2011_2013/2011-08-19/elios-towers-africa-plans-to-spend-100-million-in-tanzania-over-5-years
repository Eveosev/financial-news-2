Helios Towers Africa, a
telecommunications-tower builder and operator, plans to invest
as much as $100 million over five years in Tanzania, Chief
Executive Officer Charles Green said.  This will be in addition to the $130 million the Mauritius-
based company already spent in the acquisition of 1,180
telecommunications towers from Tigo Tanzania in December, Green
said in a telephone interview from  London  yesterday. The
Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority on Aug. 5 granted
it a license to operate a network of towers in East Africa’s
second-biggest economy, he said.  Vodacom Tanzania, a unit of  Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , is the
biggest mobile-phone operator in the country, with the local
unit of  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , Emirates Telecommunications Corp.’s
Zantel and the Tanzania Telecommunication Co. also operating in
Tanzania. Total subscribers reached 21.2 million in March,
according to the regulator.  Helios has held talks with other operators about
“colocating on our towers in Tanzania and could add investment
to acquire or build additional sites to expand our network,”
Green said.  Five institutional investors committed $375 million for
investments by Helios in sub-Saharan African markets with $180
million having been spent so far, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
