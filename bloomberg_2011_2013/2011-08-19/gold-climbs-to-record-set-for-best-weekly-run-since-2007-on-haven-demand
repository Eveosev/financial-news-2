Gold rose to a record above $1,880
an ounce in  New York , rallying for the seventh straight week, as
concern that the global economy is slowing drove equities lower.  The metal had its longest run of weekly gains since April
2007 as worse-than-expected U.S. economic data and Europe’s debt
crisis boost speculation that growth will falter. The MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities fell as much as 1.7 percent,
heading for the fourth straight weekly drop, after Morgan
Stanley cut forecasts for global growth.  “Lack of confidence in the global economy is pushing
people towards gold,” Tom Pawlicki, a Chicago-based analyst at
MF Global Holdings Ltd., said in a telephone interview. “Gold
will continue to advance unless leaders are able to resolve the
European or U.S. debt crisis.”  Gold for December delivery gained $30.20, or 1.7 percent,
to settle at $1,852.20 on the Comex at 1:42 p.m. in New York,
after touching $1,881.40, the highest ever. Prices have gained
6.3 percent this week, the most since February 2009, and 14
percent this month.  In London, the metal is in the 11th year of a  bull market 
for spot prices, the longest winning streak since at least 1920.  Financial Problems  “Gold is the currency of the world at the moment, with the
world convinced that the monetary and fiscal authorities are
likely to do nothing right and everything wrong when it comes to
resolving the world’s current fiscal problems,”  Dennis Gartman ,
the economist who correctly forecast 2008’s commodities slump,
said in his daily Gartman Letter today.  Investors want to protect their wealth from declining
equities, depreciating currencies and accelerating consumer
prices. Gold may climb next week amid concern about debt crises
and slowing growth, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Sweden’s financial regulator said lenders must do more to
prepare for a worsening debt crisis in the region as the Wall
Street Journal reported American regulators are intensifying
scrutiny of the U.S. arms of  Europe ’s largest banks.  “Medium term, the disorder of the global monetary system
and long-term inflation threat will amplify gold’s nature as a
currency and an inflation hedge,” said Cai Hongyu, an analyst
at China International Capital Corp., the country’s biggest
investment bank.  Silver futures for December delivery advanced $1.751, or
4.3 percent, to $42.467 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, prices
surged to $42.67, highest since May 3.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
September delivery fell $8.20, or 1.1 percent, to $748.80 an
ounce. The price gained 0.1 percent this week.  Platinum futures for October delivery advanced $27.20, or
1.5 percent, to $1,874.90 an ounce. That marked the 10th
straight gain, the longest rally since October 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
