Asia ’s naphtha crack spread rose for
a second week, signaling increased profit for refiners. Glencore
International AG bought gasoil for a second day in  Singapore ,
the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Vitol Group, the biggest gasoline buyer in Singapore this
month, purchased 50,000 barrels of 95-RON grade from BP Plc at
$119.80 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window. The
Geneva-based trader has bought gasoline every day this week.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures, or
the crack spread, climbed to $120.31 a ton at 5:30 p.m.
Singapore time, from $105.83 at the end of trading in Asia on
Aug. 12, Bloomberg data showed.  Middle Distillates  Glencore purchased 150,000 barrels of gasoil, or diesel,
with 0.5 percent sulfur from Barclays Plc for a second day,
according to the survey. The world’s largest commodities trader
paid 40 cents a barrel below benchmark quotes, the biggest
discount since Aug. 8.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude climbed 36
cents to $18.30 a barrel at 2:36 p.m. Singapore time, based on
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread,
a measure of refining profit, narrowed for a second week.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil increased 3 cents to $2.28 a
barrel, capping a weekly gain of 11 percent, PVM said. This
regrade widened for a second week, indicating it is more
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 84 cents to
$4.21 a barrel at 2:36 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
The gap was the smallest since Aug. 26 last year, signaling
reduced losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
was at $7.25 a ton for a third day, PVM data showed. This
viscosity spread narrowed 19 percent this week, meaning bunker,
or marine fuel, has declined less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
