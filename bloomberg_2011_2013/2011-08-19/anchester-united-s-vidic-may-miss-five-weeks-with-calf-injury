Manchester United defender Nemanja
Vidic may miss up to five weeks with a calf injury, manager  Alex
Ferguson  said.  Vidic was hurt in the season-opening 2-1 win at West Brom
last weekend. It was originally thought to be a nerve problem
that would sideline him two weeks.  “Vidic has got a calf muscle injury, which means he’ll be
four to five weeks,” Ferguson said on United’s website. “It’s
longer than we thought.”  Ferguson said defender  Rio Ferdinand , who also left the
game with a hamstring problem, could be ready for next weekend’s
match against Arsenal. Defender Patrice Evra will also return to
face Tottenham in three days after sitting out the West Brom
game with a knee injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
