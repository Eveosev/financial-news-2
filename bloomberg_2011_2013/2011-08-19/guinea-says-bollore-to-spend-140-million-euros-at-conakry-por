Bollore Group, a French company with
interests in freight and transport, plans to spend 140 million
euros ($200 million) at  Guinea ’s main port of Conakry to expand
facilities and improve equipment by 2013, said Mamadouba
Sankhon, director-general of the harbor.  The company will deepen an access channel to the harbor to
13.5 meters (44 feet) from the current 9.5 meters, and build two
quays that will allow Conakry to handle large  container ships ,
he told reporters yesterday in the capital. Those ships
currently use the port at Dakar, Senegal, for offloading,
Sankhon said.  Bollore was awarded the contract for the Conakry port in
March, two days after President Alpha Conde canceled a 2008 deal
between the West African nation and NCT Necotrans Group unit
Getma International, citing a “breach of dealer obligations.”  Bollore (BOL)  plans to build a dry port at Dubreka, 50 kilometers
north of Conakry, Sankhon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
