Vietnam ’s bonds rose the most since
June after the government offered lower yields at an auction and
forecast that interest rates will drop. The dong was steady.  The State Treasury sold 1 trillion dong ($48.1 million) of
five-year bonds at 12.48 percent in an auction yesterday,
compared with 12.50 percent at the previous sale, according to a
statement posted on the Hanoi Stock Exchange’s website.
Commercial lending rates will likely decline next month as cash
at banks has improved and the rate of inflation has slowed, Le
Xuan Nghia, vice-chairman of the National Financial Supervisory
Commission, said yesterday.  “Demand for bonds rose since some banks have had more
funds amid anticipation that yields may drop in line with
possible declines in  interest rates ,” said Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based Ocean Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank.  The yield on benchmark five-year notes dropped eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, the most since June 29, to
12.50 percent today, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate fell five basis points this
week.  The dong was at 20,787 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in Hanoi,
compared with 20,792 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency strengthened 0.1 percent this week.  The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,618,
unchanged from Aug. 10, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Ven Ram, James Regan  To contact the reporter on this story:
