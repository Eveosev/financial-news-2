Ice Miller LLP and Schottenstein Zox
& Dunn Co. plan to merge in January, creating a  law firm  with
314 attorneys in offices in the Midwest and  Washington .  The combined law firm, which will operate under the Ice
Miller name, will rank among the 150 largest in the U.S., the
firms said today in a statement. Phil Bayt, Indianapolis-based
Ice Miller’s chief managing partner, will continue in that role
after the merger.  “SZD is a preeminent firm with a stellar reputation,”
Bayt said in the statement. “Its clients, culture and Midwestern
roots are a great fit.”  Established in 1910, Ice Miller’s client list includes
Angie’s List Inc., Fifth Third Bancorp and Indianapolis Motor
Speedway Corp. Columbus, Ohio-based Schottenstein Zox, founded
in 1966, is known for handling complex business transactions and
works as counsel for government entities throughout Ohio, the
firms said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
