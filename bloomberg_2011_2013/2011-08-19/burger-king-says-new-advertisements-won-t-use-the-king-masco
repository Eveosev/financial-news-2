Burger King Holdings Inc. will air
new commercials that won’t feature its mascot, The King, as the
hamburger chain gears its advertisements to appeal more to
families.  “Our marketing strategy and marketing approach has
changed, and as a part of that, the King will not be used,”
Miguel Piedra, a company spokesman, said in a telephone
interview today. The television commercials will start this
weekend and “will not feature the King,” he said.  Burger King, with more than 12,300 locations worldwide,
hired New York-based ad firm McGarryBowen earlier this year to
create more family-friendly advertisements. The McGarryBowen
commercials airing Aug. 20 will promote the California Whopper
sandwich for $4.49.  The hamburger chain introduced the King in 1955 as a kid-
friendly cartoon with curled hair and a red robe, according to
the company’s website. In 2004, Burger King hired ad agency
Crispin Porter + Bogusky, which created a following with
commercials featuring the King as a silent, Renaissance-garbed
figure who greets customers in bed with breakfast sandwiches.  3G Capital Inc., based in  New York , bought Miami-based
Burger King in October for about $3.93 billion, the largest
restaurant transaction in 2010, according to Bloomberg data.
Revenue in the year ended June 30, 2010, declined 1.4 percent to
$2.5 billion while net income fell 6.6 percent to $186.8
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
