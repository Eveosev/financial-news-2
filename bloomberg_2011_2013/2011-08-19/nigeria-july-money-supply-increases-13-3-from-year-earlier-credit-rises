Nigerian credit to the private
sector rose 0.6 percent in July, the first increase since
November 2010, as the banking system stabilized.  Private-sector lending advanced to 9.9 trillion naira
($64.4 billion) last month, the central bank said on its website
today. The M2  money supply  climbed 13 percent, up from 12
percent in June, the Abuja-based bank said.  The central bank set up the Asset Management Corp. of
 Nigeria , or Amcon, last year to buy the bad debts of banks to
prevent a collapse in the industry. Banks received bonds for
their debts that can be discounted for cash to enable them
resume lending.  That injected more funds into the banking system, aiding
the “rise in money supply and the marginal growth in credit,”
Bismark Rewane, analyst and chief executive officer of Lagos-
based Financial Derivatives Co., said by phone.  Still, credit growth remains weak as banks continue to
avoid risk while rebuilding their balance sheets, Rewane said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
