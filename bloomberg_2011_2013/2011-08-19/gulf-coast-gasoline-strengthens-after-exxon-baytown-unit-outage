Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast 
strengthened after Exxon Mobil Corp. said a fluid catalytic
cracker was offline at its Baytown, Texas, refinery, the largest
in the U.S.  The gasoline-making unit and a catalytic light-ends unit at
the 584,000-barrel-a-day plant were down, Neely Nelson, a
spokeswoman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an e-
mail yesterday.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2.5 cents to 4.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:50 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
increased 7.91 cents to $2.7923 a gallon.  The premium for the same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3,
increased 2.25 cents to 9 cents a gallon, the widest
differential since May 13, after refinery outages threatened to
crimp supply. Higher prices in the Midwest may increase the
demand for pipeline deliveries into the region from refineries
on the Gulf Coast.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. shut a fluid catalytic cracker at
its Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery after a leak caused a fire
Aug. 17, according to a filing with state regulators. A crude
unit at  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) â€™s Memphis, Tennessee, plant is down
for repairs after a fire.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  is conducting planned maintenance at the
Ponca City refinery in  Oklahoma , Janet Grothe, a company
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
