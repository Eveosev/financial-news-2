U.S. fuel demand fell in July, the
first monthly drop this year, as weakness in the economy led to
declines in gasoline, heating oil and fuel oil use, according to
the  American Petroleum Institute .  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, dropped 0.5 percent to 19.2 million barrels a day last
month from a year earlier, the industry-funded group said today
in a report. Year-to-date consumption has averaged 19 million
barrels a day, down 0.1 percent from the same period in 2010.  Demand declined with the U.S. unemployment rate hovering at
or above 9 percent for the past four months after falling to 8.8
percent in February, Labor Department data show.  “Consumers aren’t spending and jobless claims have
increased so it’s not surprising gasoline was down and overall
demand slipped a bit,”  John Felmy , chief economist with the
Washington-based API, said in the report.  Gasoline demand declined 2.8 percent to 9.04 million
barrels a day in July compared with the same month last year. It
was the lowest level of July consumption of the motor fuel in
the past decade, according to the report.  Demand for residual fuels plunged 27 percent to 436,000
barrels a day last month from a year earlier, the report showed.
Residual fuel is used for commercial and industrial heating,
electricity generation and ship propulsion.  Distillate Fuels  Consumption of distillate fuels, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, rose 11 percent to 3.93 million barrels
a day. Demand for ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, climbed 15 percent to average 3.69 million barrels a
day, the report showed. Heating-oil use tumbled 26 percent to
244,000 barrels a day.  Jet-fuel use climbed 2.6 percent to an average 1.53 million
barrels a day last month compared with the same period in 2010.  U.S. crude-oil production fell 1.5 percent to an average
5.21 million barrels a day. Output in the lower 48 states
dropped 0.1 percent to 4.74 million barrels a day. Alaskan
production decreased 13 percent to 473,000 barrels a day.  Gasoline futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose
0.55 cent to $2.7887 a gallon at 9:33 a.m. Prices have climbed
14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
