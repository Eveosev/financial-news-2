Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said
Group of Seven nations should maintain close contact in coming
weeks.  Speaking to reporters in  Tokyo  today, he was addressing a
question about what policymakers should be doing to address a
global stock decline. On Aug. 8, G-7 finance ministers and
central bank governors pledged in a statement to “take all
necessary measures to support financial stability and growth”
after a global stock sell-off. The group said officials would
inject liquidity and act against disorderly currency moves as
needed. The G-20, which includes emerging markets, issued a
similar communique.  To contact the reporter on this story:
