Players under contract with National
Basketball Association teams won’t be allowed to play in the
Chinese Basketball Association, while free agents may only join
the Chinese league if they commit to a full season, the  Xinhua
News Agency reported .  “We welcome free-agent players of the NBA to play at least
a full season in the CBA,” said Bai Xilin, director of the CBA
league office, according to Xinhua.  With the NBA and the National Basketball Players
Association entering the 50th day of a lockout, players like New
Jersey Nets guard  Deron Williams , have chosen to play abroad in
countries such as Turkey and Israel until the labor dispute is
resolved, agreeing to contracts that allow their return to the
NBA when the lockout ends.  The  International Basketball Federation , known as FIBA, of
which the NBA and CBA are members, said last month that the NBA
won’t object to any players signing with affiliated leagues upon
the stipulation that they return to the NBA as soon as the
lockout ends.  The CBA ruling bans players such as Los Angeles Lakers
guard  Kobe Bryant , who had considered joining Shanxi Zhongyu,
and other NBA players under contract from playing in  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
