(Corrects second paragraph to clarify that S&P doesn’t
expect to alter  Germany ’s ratings.)  Standard & Poor’s Rating Services’
German unit head Torsten Hinrichs is “skeptical” about a
possible issuance of common euro-area bonds, the WAZ newspaper
group reported, citing an interview. “The main condition for
joint euro bonds to work in the long term would be a stronger
political and economic integration in  Europe . We are still far
away from that,” the newspaper cited him as saying.  S&P has a “stable” outlook on German debt, which means
the rating company doesn’t expect to change Germany’s ratings
within the next two years, Hinrichs told WAZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
