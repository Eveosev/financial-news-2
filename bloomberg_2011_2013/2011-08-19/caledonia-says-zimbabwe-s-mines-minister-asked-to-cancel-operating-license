Caledonia Mining Corp. (CAL)  said
 Zimbabwe ’s indigenization minister asked the country’s mines
minister to cancel its operating license for Blanket gold mine
because the company’s proposal on ownership changes didn’t meet
the government’s requirements.  The request was contained in a letter from the
indigenization minister,  Saviour Kasukuwere , to the minister of
mines,  Obert Mpofu , the Toronto-based company said in a stock
exchange statement today.  The minister had “exceeded his legal powers” and the
company was considering apppropriate legal action, it said.
Other mining companies and banks may been instructed to revise
their proposals or risk losing their operating licenses,
Caledonia said. Zimbabwe wants foreign companies to sell a
majority stake to citizens of the country.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
