Brazilian Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said he will try to meet the primary fiscal surplus
target through 2014 without subtracting spending on the
government’s infrastructure investment plan from budget outlays,
Valor Economico reported.  Brazil hasn’t changed its pledge of focusing on its fiscal
budget and lowering interest rates, Mantega told the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
