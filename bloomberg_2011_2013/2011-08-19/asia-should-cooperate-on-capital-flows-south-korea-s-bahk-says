Asian countries should work together
to cope with capital flows and reduce borrowings from other
regions,  South Korea ’s Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, plus Japan,
 China  and South Korea, should try to more than double its $120
billion foreign-currency reserve pool known as the Chiang Mai
Initiative in case of capital flight, Bahk said in a speech
prepared for delivery in Seoul today. He also called for closer
policy coordination and more free trade agreements among Asian
countries to tackle the global financial turmoil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
