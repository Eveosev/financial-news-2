What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that hail
and wind storms in Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa overnight and dry
weather in parts of the eastern Midwest will erode prospects for
crops, Brian Grete, a senior market analyst at the Professional
Farmers of American newsletter in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on concern that dry Midwest weather will reduce
yields, Grete said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
steady to up 0.1 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may open
steady to $1 higher for 2,000 pounds. The dollar’s drop may
boost investor demand for commodities as a hedge against
inflation, he said.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on a forecast that  Australia ’s output will
shrink, Grete said. Drought threatens to delay or prevent
planting in the U.S. Great Plains in the next two months, he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
