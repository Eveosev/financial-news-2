The U.S. love affair with the car
pretty much began in 1893, when the first gasoline-powered
Duryea Motor Wagon appeared. The horse-less carriage had many
drawbacks: It was open to the weather, slow to stop and often
tipped over. The one big advantage was the absence of a horse.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Using animals for transport was slow-going, requiring
frequent stops for rest, food and water. Upkeep was expensive,
nationally running to about $2 billion a year at that time.  There were other problems as well. Big cities had huge
equine populations:  Kansas City , for example, boasted one steed
for every 7.4 residents. In bustling  New York , horses accounted
for 2.5 million pounds of manure and 60,000 gallons of urine
deposited in the muddy streets every single day.  Even though U.S. roads were mainly rutted cart paths based
on trails originally made by wild animals, car registrations hit
the million mark in 1912. The following year, a bold plan for a
coast-to-coast rock highway was born.  I spoke with Earl Swift, author of “ The Big Roads ,” on
the following topics:  1. Mud & Manure  2. Love of Wheels  3. Limited Access Highway  4. Ruinous Neglect  5. Strip-Mall Ugliness  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
