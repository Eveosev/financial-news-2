The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:39 a.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.3 percent to 13,009.55, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.5 percent to 1,573.94.  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB)  , Colombia’s
second-biggest electricity distributor, fell 3.6 percent, the
most intraday in six months, to 1,350 pesos. The company said it
is preparing documents for a debt management operation on up to
$133 million in overseas bonds that mature in 2014, according to
a regulatory filing late yesterday. Investors may be speculating
that the company is preparing a credit default swap, said Camilo
Rubiano, an analyst at Afin SA.  Investors are also anticipating a dilution of shares after
shareholders approved on Aug. 10 plans to sell as much as 1
trillion pesos ($562.3 million) worth of shares, Rubiano said.  Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR)  , the
parent company of  Colombia ’s largest bank, fell 0.8 percent to
33,220 pesos. The company, which announced it would offer shares
worth as much as $2.1 billion in October to help fund the
acquisition of ING’s Latin American assets, may refrain from
selling the full amount amid the rout in global financial
markets, Chief Executive Officer David Bojanini said in an
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
