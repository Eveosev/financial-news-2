Turkey ’s Sok discount supermarket
chain removed alcohol from the shelves of its 1,230 stores two
months after Turkey’s Yildiz Holding AS agreed to buy the
retailer for $380 million,  Vatan  newspaper reported.  Sok began removing alcoholic beverages on Aug. 1, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said. Alcohol sales are about 6 percent
of the company’s total revenue, it said.  Yildiz Holding agreed to buy the Godiva chocolates brand
from  Campbell Soup Co. (CPB)  for $850 million in 2007. It doesn’t sell
Godiva chocolates flavored with alcohol in Turkey, Vatan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
