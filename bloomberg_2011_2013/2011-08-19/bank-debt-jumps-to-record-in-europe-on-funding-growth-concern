The cost of protecting European
financial debt surged to a record on concern global economic
growth is faltering and banks will struggle to fund themselves.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
linked to senior debt of 25 banks and insurers increased as much
as 12 basis points to 243, a record based on closing prices,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and was trading at 237 basis
points at 10:30 a.m. in  London .  The  U.S. economy  may expand less than previously forecast
in 2011 and 2012 because of potential “political paralysis”
and fiscal tightening steps, according to Citigroup Inc. Stocks
tumbled around the world, oil sank, the yen and Swiss franc
rose, while gold climbed to an  all-time high.  “Another bout of macro volatility has taken markets
materially wider,” Sherif Hamid, a London-based analyst at
 Barclays Capital , wrote in a note. “A spate of weaker growth
data and continuing sovereign and banking-related concerns have
fed the ‘risk-off’ beast.”  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps linked
to the debt of 15 governments increased for a third day,
climbing 1 basis point to 291. Contracts on Spanish government
debt rose 6 basis points to 370, according to CMA. Italy swaps
added 8 basis points to 362 and  France  was up 2 to 152.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 11 basis points to
655.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2 basis points to 154 basis
points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
