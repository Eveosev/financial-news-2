AccessKenya (ACCESS)  Group Ltd., the East
African nation’s only publicly traded Internet company, reversed
its first gain in five days, which was spurred by an agreement
to provide  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) ’s local unit a fiber-optic
connection for calls.  Kenya’s worst-performing share this year closed unchanged
at 6.10 shillings by 3 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, after
earlier increasing 0.8 percent. AccessKenya shares have fallen
55 percent this year.  Airtel Kenya Ltd. will buy fixed-line voice circuits from
AccesKenya’s fiber optic network in more than 300 buildings in
Nairobi and Mombasa, the second-biggest city. AccessKenya is
linking an average of 10 buildings a month to its fiber optic
network, Managing Director Jonathan Somen said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
