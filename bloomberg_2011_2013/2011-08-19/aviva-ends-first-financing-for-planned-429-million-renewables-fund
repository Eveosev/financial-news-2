Aviva Investors, the global asset
management arm of London-based Aviva Plc, closed the first round
of financing for its European Renewable Energy Fund as part of
plans to raise a total of 300 million euros ($430 million).  Aviva, with about 269 billion pounds ($445 billion) of
assets under management, expects to attract the full amount
through 2011 and into 2012, Ian Berry, a  fund manager  for
infrastructure and renewable energy at the company, said by e-
mail, declining to say how much it has achieved so far.  “A typical investor is a long-term investor such as
insurance companies, pension funds and other institutional
investors,” he said yesterday. “Investors in the fund are
targeting stable, asset-based, income-producing, inflation
protected returns with an attractive yield.”  Worldwide new investment in clean energy climbed 22 percent
to $41.7 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data published July
13. Private equity and venture capital investment increased 74
percent to $3.1 billion, the highest for any quarter since 2008.  The fund will invest directly in renewable energy assets in
operation, as well as considering projects being built, Berry
said. It will focus on solar photovoltaic projects and onshore
wind, and on the “largest markets and economies” in  Europe ,
including  France , Italy,  Germany ,  Spain  and the U.K., he said.  The fund, with a 10-year life, will invest as much as 50
million euros each in as many as 20 projects, seeking mature
technology supported by stable regulatory regimes, Berry said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
