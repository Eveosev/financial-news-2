Two senior members of  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) ’s Asia capital markets teams have left the lender,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  Michael Luk, Asia-Pacific head of debt capital markets,
left earlier this week while Andrew Cooper, head of corporate
finance and structured equity-linked products, quit at the
beginning of the month, the people said, asking not to be
identified as details are private. Both were based in  Hong Kong 
and are not expected to be replaced, the people said.  Bank of America is ranked as the No. 4 arranger of bond
sales in dollars, euro or yen in Asia-Pacific outside of Japan
this year with a 7.8 percent market share, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Rob Stewart , a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, declined to comment when contacted by e-
mail at his office in Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
