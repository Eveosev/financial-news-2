Abengoa SA (ABG) ,  Spain â€™s largest biofuel
producer, was offered a $139.9 million loan guarantee from the
U.S. Energy Department to build a cellulosic ethanol plant in
Hugoton, Kansas.  The project will convert 300,000 tons of corn stalks and
leaves into 23 million gallons (87 million liters) of ethanol a
year, the Energy Department said today in a statement. The plant
will also have a 20-megawatt biomass electric generator fueled
by leftover plant material. Seville-based Abengoa is expected to
add 300 construction jobs and 65 permanent ones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
