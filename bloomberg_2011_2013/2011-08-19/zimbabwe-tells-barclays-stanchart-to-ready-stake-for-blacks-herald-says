Zimbabwe  has given  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  two weeks to show how they will
distribute 51 percent of their units in the country to black
Zimbabweans, the  Herald  said, citing letters written to the
companies by Indigenization Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere .  If the lenders don’t comply, they risk losing their
licenses to operate in Zimbabwe, the state-controlled Herald
said on its website. Kasukuwere has given the same two-week
notice to mining concern Zimplats Ltd., Impala Platinum Ltd.-
owned Mimosa mine, Duration Gold Mine, Blanket Mine, Rio Tinto
Plc-owned Murowa diamond mine, BAT Plc’s Zimbabwe-listed unit,
Nestle Zimbabwe and Cargill Zimbabwe, the Herald added.  The companies must submit their plans to Kasukuwere’s
ministry showing how within the next five years they will
dispose of the majority stakes of their companies.  Switchboard operators at  Standard Chartered  and Barclays
Zimbabwe Ltd. said today no-one was available to comment on the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
