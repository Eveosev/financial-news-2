Brazilian airline  Tam SA (TAMM4)  gained the
most in a week after Banco Santander SA said a jump in traffic
in July will boost third-quarter earnings.  Tam, Brazil’s largest airline by market value, rose 1.9
percent to 29.70 reais at the 4:15 p.m. New York time close,
trimming its decline this year to 24 percent.  Gol Linhas Aereas
Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) , its next largest rival, climbed 1.1 percent to
10.22 reais. Gol is the worst performer on the Bovespa index
this year with a 59 percent drop, compared to 24 percent for the
benchmark.  Tam’s international traffic growth quickened to 12.3
percent year-on-year in July from 9 percent the previous month,
while Gol’s travel abroad shrank 12 percent after a contraction
of 15.9 percent in June, according to an e-mailed statement from
 Brazil ’s civil aviation agency, known as Anac.  “Tam’s strong performance in the international market was
the main positive highlight,” analysts at Banco Santander SA,
including Caio Dias, wrote in a note to clients today. “We look
favorably upon Tam’s July traffic figures, which indicate that
TAM should report better results than Gol in” the third
quarter.  Gol’s share of the domestic air-travel market increased to
38.1 percent in July from 37.1 percent the previous month, while
Tam’s fell to 40.9 percent from 41.7 percent, according to Anac.
Gol’s domestic travel growth quickened to 19.6 percent year-on-
year in July from 13 percent the previous month, while Tam’s
slowed to 13.7 percent from 15.5 percent.  “Due to the school vacation in Brazil, July is a month in
which there are a large number of passengers flying for leisure,
which benefits Gol,” the Santander analysts said.  Tam controls 88 percent of Brazil’s international aviation
market, compared to 10.5 percent for Gol, according to Anac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
