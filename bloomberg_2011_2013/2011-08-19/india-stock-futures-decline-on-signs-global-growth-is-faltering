India’s benchmark stock index
completed the longest weekly losing streak since 2008 on concern
the U.S. economy is faltering and Europe’s debt crisis may
spread, hurting corporate profits already threatened by
inflation and rising interest rates.  Infosys Ltd., the nation’s second-largest software services
provider which gets 98 percent of sales from overseas, tumbled
to the lowest since November 2009.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest
truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover, dropped to its lowest
since May 2010.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
328.12 points, or 2 percent, to 16,141.67 at the 3:30 p.m. close
in Mumbai, its lowest since May 25, 2010. The gauge fell 4.1
percent this week, its fourth straight week of losses and the
longest run since October 2008, when the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. froze credit markets.  “The fiscal situation in the U.S. and other countries is
not so great,” said Punita Kumar-Sinha, chief investment
officer at Blackstone Asia Advisors LLC. “I don’t think we
could end up in a Lehman-like situation. We expect further
stimulus measures in the West. Tight liquidity issues remain a
concern.”  Data yesterday showed U.S. jobless claims and consumer
prices rose, while Philadelphia-area manufacturing shrank to the
lowest level since 2009 and existing home sales fell. The  U.S.
economy  may expand less than previously forecast in 2011 and
2012 because of potential “political paralysis” and fiscal
tightening, Citigroup Inc. wrote in a report yesterday.  Bear Market   Losses today dragged the Sensex down 23 percent from a Nov.
5 peak, exceeding the 20 percent level marking a so-called bear
market for some investors. The S&P CNX Nifty Index dropped 2
percent to 4,845.65 and its August futures settled at 4,850. The
BSE 200 Index decreased 1.7 percent to 2,004.13.  The India VIX, which measures the cost of buying protection
against losses in the Nifty Index, rose 6.3 percent to 29.2,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “There are concerns about a double-dip recession, given
the weak data points we have seen from the U.S. and  Europe  and
other economies,” said Navneet Munot, who oversees $10.5
billion as chief investment officer at SBI Funds Management
Pvt., a unit of India’s biggest lender. “We are cautious on the
outlook of the global economy. They will have anemic growth for
a long time given that policy ammunition both on the fiscal and
monetary side is quite limited in the U.S., Europe and  Japan .”  Lower Estimates  Citigroup cut its 2011 gross domestic product growth
forecast for the U.S. to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent and
lowered its 2012 GDP growth estimate to 2.1 percent from 2.7
percent, analysts Steven Wieting and Shawn Snyder wrote in a
report dated yesterday. Morgan Stanley yesterday reduced its
forecast for India’s 2012 gross domestic product growth to 7.4
percent from 7.8 percent and its estimate for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2013, to 7.6 percent from 8 percent.  India’s economy  has become more attractive and is well
positioned to receive capital inflows as developed nations face
weaker economic prospects, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Infosys declined 5.5 percent to 2,224.7 rupees, while
larger rival  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  fell 3.5 percent to
928.95 rupees.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest software services
provider, slid 2.4 percent to 320.35 rupees and its August
futures settled at 320 rupees. India’s top software exporters
get 80 percent of their sales from overseas. BNP Paribas SA
yesterday lowered its recommendation on the industry to
“deteriorating” and cut its ratings on the three companies to
“reduce” from “buy.”  Panic Selling  “All globally exposed Indian companies will face issues in
terms of earnings growth,” Blackstone’s Kumar-Sinha said in an
interview with Bloomberg UTV. “There is a lot of panic selling
out there on the back of growth fears.”  Earnings for 46 percent of Sensex companies missed analyst
estimates in the three months ended June, according to Bloomberg
data. That compares with 33 percent that lagged behind forecasts
in the previous quarter.  The Sensex has lost 21 percent this year, the worst
performer after  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index among the world’s 10
biggest markets, on concern higher borrowing costs will slow
economic growth and erode earnings. Companies on the Sensex are
valued at 13.4 times estimated earnings, compared with a
multiple of 9.6 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Living Costs  The central bank has raised its repurchase rate 11 times
since the start of 2010 and last increased it by 50 basis points
on July 26 to 8 percent to damp living costs that are rising the
fastest among the so-called BRICS nations of Brazil,  Russia ,
India,  China  and  South Africa .  Tata Motors plunged 5.3 percent to 712.35 rupees.  Mahindra
& Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the nation’s biggest maker of  sport utility
vehicles , toppled the maker of the world’s cheapest car, the
Nano, as the nation’s biggest automaker by market value after
slumping passenger car demand dragged down Tata’s shares.  Mahindra gained 0.2 percent to 718.5 rupees, giving it a
market capitalization of 441 billion rupees ($9.6 billion). Tata
Motors is valued at 422.6 billion rupees.  Tata Motor’s Jaguar deliveries have declined this year as
the European debt crisis and signs of slowing economic growth in
the U.S. eroded demand for  luxury vehicles . The automaker, whose
overseas sales account for about 63 percent of total revenue,
has dropped 46 percent this year, while rival Mahindra, which
exports about 5 percent of its vehicles abroad, has declined 7.7
percent.  Benchmark Inflation  India ’s benchmark wholesale-price inflation in July rose
9.22 percent from a year earlier, staying at more than 9 percent
for an eighth straight month. The median of 22 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 9.2 percent gain.  India’s food inflation slowed, government data showed
yesterday, an easing that may be insufficient to prevent the
central bank from raising rates further.  A panel advising the  Reserve Bank  differed over the extent
to which policy makers should raise rates last month, according
to the minutes of the meeting held six days before the July 26
decision, the bank said yesterday in an e-mail. The bank meets
for its next policy review on Sept. 16.  “We remain skeptical about a broad-based recovery in the
Nifty until Sept. 16, when the central bank meets to decide
interest-rate policy,” Jigar Shah, senior vice-president and
head of research at Kim Eng Securities India Pvt., said in a
note to clients today. “Unless there is a pause in the central
bank’s rate-tightening exercise, we expect the Nifty to go down
further to 4,500, a two-year low.”  Overseas funds sold a net 4.08 billion rupees ($89.9
million) of Indian equities on Aug. 17, paring their investment
in stocks this year to 38.5 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporters on this story:
