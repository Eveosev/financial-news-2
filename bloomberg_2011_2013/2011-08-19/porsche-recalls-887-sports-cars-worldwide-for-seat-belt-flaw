Porsche AG is recalling 887 sports
cars worldwide for a seat-belt flaw that may cause the belts to
be too loose and not protect occupants.  The recall, which includes 235 in the U.S., is for some
model year 2011 and 2012 vehicles such as the 911 Carrera, 911
GT3, 911 Speedster, 911 Targa, 911 Turbo, Boxster and Cayman,
said Porsche, based in Stuttgart,  Germany .  About 10 percent of the cars, which are two-door coupes
made from May 31 to June 10, contain the defect, Porsche told
the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in a
notice posted today on the agency’s  website .  The defect is “due to a supplier’s short-term
manufacturing problem” and no accidents or injuries have been
caused by it, Hermann-Josef Stappen, a Porsche spokesman, said
in an e-mail. The company will examine the seat-belt mounts and
replace seat belts if necessary, he said.  The mounting holes for seat-belt anchor plates may be too
small, meaning the plate may not rotate around the fastening
bolt as designed when tightening the belt, Porsche said in the
filing to the regulator.  The 2011 model-year cars in the recall are the GT3 RS and
911 Speedsters. The 2012 model-year vehicles are 911 Carreras,
911 Targas, 911 Turbos, Boxsters and Caymans.  Porsche is being integrated into  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  as part of a
merger with parent company Porsche SE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
