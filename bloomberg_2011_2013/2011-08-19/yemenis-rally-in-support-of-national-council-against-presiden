Tens of thousands of people rallied
across Yemen after Friday prayers today in support of a national
council of opposition parties united against the rule of
President Ali Abdullah Saleh.  The 143-member national council, established on Aug. 17,
will elect a chairman and deputies tomorrow at a meeting in
Sana’a, council member Mohammed al-Sabri said by telephone. The
council will also elect a 20-member executive board, he said.  Mass protests since February in the Arab world’s poorest
country have demanded the removal of the president, inspired by
popular revolts that ousted the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt .
The national council will work to intensify pressure on Saleh to
step down, according to a document distributed on Aug. 17 by the
Joint Meeting Parties, the country’s main opposition coalition.  In the southern city of Taiz, tens of thousands of people
rallied in support of the council, Salah Saleh, an activist,
said today by phone. In Sana’a, the capital, thousands chanted
“our national council, 25 million Yemenis follow you,” as they
demonstrated in the center of the city.  The council includes members from the Joint Meeting
Parties, the southern opposition movement, Shiite Houthi rebels,
youth protesters, activists in exile and tribes. It has no
conservative Islamic members from Salafist parties.  Saleh supporters today gathered near the presidential
compound, carrying photos of the president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
