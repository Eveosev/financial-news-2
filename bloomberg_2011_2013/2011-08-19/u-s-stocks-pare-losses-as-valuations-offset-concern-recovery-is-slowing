U.S. stocks erased losses as better-
than-estimated technology company earnings and valuations near
the cheapest level since the  bull market  began in 2009 offset
concern the economy is slowing.  Intuit Inc. surged 12 percent and Salesforce.com Inc.
rallied 3.7 percent after reporting earnings that topped
analysts’ estimates. Hewlett-Packard Co. slumped 22 percent
after agreeing to buy U.K. software maker Autonomy Corp. Crude
oil erased most of its earlier drop, while the euro rallied on
speculation the region will sell joint bonds to halt the debt
crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.3 percent to
1,144.16 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.9
percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
