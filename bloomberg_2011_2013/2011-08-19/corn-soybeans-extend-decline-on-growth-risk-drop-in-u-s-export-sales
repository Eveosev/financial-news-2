Corn climbed for the first time in
three sessions as falling stockpiles revived speculation that
supplies aren’t enough to meet demand. Wheat and soybeans rose.  Global corn stockpiles may fall 6.8 percent in the 2011-12
marketing year to 114.5 million metric tons, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said in a report on Aug. 11. The USDA
lowered its global production forecast 1.4 percent to 860.5
million tons and its U.S. output estimate 4.1 percent to 328
million tons.  “Even though grain prices have come off a bit, they’re
maintaining their strength pretty well,” said  William Adams , a
 fund manager  at Resilience AG in Zurich. “We have a really
short inventory issue that we have to address. The fundamental
picture is still intact.”  Corn for December delivery gained 3.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $7.1625 a bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price has gained 0.2 percent this
week.  Wheat for December delivery rose 2.5 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $7.4175 a bushel in  Chicago . The most-active contract is up
1.3 percent this week. Milling wheat for November delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris was little changed at 197.25 euros
($283.86) a metric ton.  Soybeans for November delivery rose 3 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $13.64 a bushel in Chicago. The price has risen 2.2
percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
