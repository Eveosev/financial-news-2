University of Connecticut  athletic
director Jeff Hathaway has agreed to a buyout and will leave the
Huskies, two  Connecticut  newspapers reported today.  The Hartford Courant and the Connecticut Post both reported
on their websites that Hathaway and school officials had reached
an agreement that paved the way for him to give up his position.
Each newspaper based its information on an unidentified person.  There was no official word of an agreement on the
universityâ€™s website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
