OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, fell to the lowest in a year as banks worldwide sank on
fears the debt crisis may cause funding problems.  The shares slid 3.4 percent to 78.83 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the lowest level since August last year.  The Wall Street Journal yesterday reported that U.S.
regulators are scrutinizing  Europe ’s largest lenders on concern
the sovereign debt crisis may lead to funding problems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
