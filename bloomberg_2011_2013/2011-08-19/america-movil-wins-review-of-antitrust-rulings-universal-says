America Movil  SAB and its Telefonos
de Mexico SAB unit won a Mexico Supreme Court ruling forcing the
antitrust commission to review findings that the companies are
dominant in their industries,  El Universal  newspaper said.  The ruling means the antitrust agency will have to
reconsider a 2009 finding that Telmex was dominant in four
aspects of the fixed-line phone business and a 2010 finding that
America Movil’s wireless unit, Telcel, was dominant in the
mobile-phone market, the newspaper said.  Because of the Supreme Court ruling, the Federal
Telecommunications Commission will have to await the antitrust
agency’s review of the dominance findings before it can craft
regulations designed to reduce the market power of Telmex and
Telcel, El Universal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
