U.K. stocks retreated, extending

percent and rising 0.3 percent. The gauge lost 5.3 percent this
week, extending its selloff from the end of June to 17 percent
and wiping more than $500 billion from the value of U.K. shares.
The FTSE All-Share Index fell 1 percent today and Ireland’s ISEQ
Index lost 1.4 percent.  “Investors continue to have fear about global growth,”
said Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at  City Index .

should sell into any short-term rebound in stocks after economic
data raised the risk of a global recession. Releases this week
showed Germany’s economy almost stalled in the second quarter

regions unexpectedly contracted in August.  U.S. Growth Forecasts  Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut their forecasts

quarter growth to 1 percent from 2.5 percent.  Lloyds tumbled 4.8 percent to 28.38 pence,  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  sank 5.4 percent to 20.77 pence and  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  fell 2.3 percent to 150.5 pence.  Deutsche Bank financial analyst, Matt Spick said in a
report to clients today that European banks may have “negative
earnings momentum” in the second half of the year as capital
markets revenue “disappoints” and  interest rates  remain low.
He also warned that lenders may face a “slower moving, but
still toxic, funding crisis.”  Wood Group dropped 3.6 percent to 507.5 pence after
JPMorgan lowered its recommendation for the oil-services company

avoid stocks with “poor earnings visibility.”  GKN Downgrade  GKN lost 2.6 percent to 183.5 pence as Goldman Sachs Group
