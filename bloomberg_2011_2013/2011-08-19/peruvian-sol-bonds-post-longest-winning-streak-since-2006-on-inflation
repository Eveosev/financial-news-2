Peruvian bonds posted their longest
winning streak since 2006 as traders bet a slowdown in the
global economy will spread to the Andean nation and help contain
inflation.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 declined four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.90 percent at 2:57 p.m. in  New York ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose
0.25 centimo to 113.32 centimos per sol.  Bond yields have fallen for nine straight days, the longest
streak since the period ending Dec. 18, 2006, when yields also
fell for nine days. Yields shed 12 basis points this week.  Investors are betting Peruvian inflation will ease as
slower growth in  Europe  and the U.S. dim growth prospects for
the South American country and cause international food and fuel
prices to fall, said  Siobhan Morden , head of Latin American
strategy at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford , Connecticut.  “Inflation expectations have collapsed,” Morden said.
“It’s not a liquidity crisis like we had in 2008, but more the
traditional global slowdown. Emerging markets aren’t heading
into crisis, but there are certainly slower growth prospects.”  The deceleration in the world economy and domestic activity
in Peru led the country’s central bank Aug. 11 to keep  interest
rates  unchanged for a third month.  Inflation will ease after hitting a three-year high in
July, the central bank’s research director Adrian Armas said
Aug. 12.  Economic Outlook  Peru’s export revenue is likely to fall next year as global
demand for its metals declines, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla
said Aug. 8. The $153 billion economy will expand 6 percent to
6.5 percent this year, after growing 7.7 percent in the first
half, he said.  “If metal prices were to plummet, Peru’s economy could
contract in 2012, due to its heavy reliance on mining
investments,” Nomura Securities Inc. said today in an e-mailed
report. “Under this scenario, we would expect the central bank
to cut rates aggressively and for the government to increase
spending in order to jump-start the economy.”  Peru is the world’s biggest silver producer, third largest
in copper and zinc, and sixth in gold.  The sol strengthened 0.3 percent to 2.7340 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7414 yesterday. That’s the currency’s strongest level
since April 2008.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell six basis points to 210,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
