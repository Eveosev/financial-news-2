The Czech Republic’s PX stock index
declined for a second day, falling 1.7 percent to 988.4 at its
4:28 p.m. close in Prague. The benchmark erased all gains this
week and stood down 16 percent so far this month.  The following were among the most active equities on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of  Austria  slid 3.8 percent
to 581.1 koruna, its lowest close in two years.  Komercni Banka
AS (KOMB)  , the Czech unit of Societe Generale SA, declined
for a second day, losing 1.5 percent to 3,082 koruna.  European banks tumbled on concern companies will struggle
to fund themselves and increase earnings as the region’s
sovereign debt crisis strangles economic growth.  New World Resources Plc (NWR CP), the largest Czech coking-
coal producer, slumped 1.6 percent to 158.49 koruna, extending
yesterday’s 5.8 percent retreat.  Europe ’s benchmark coal futures
contracts slid to the lowest in almost two weeks.  Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA slid 5.7 percent to 149
koruna, its biggest one-day drop since Aug. 9. The Czech
