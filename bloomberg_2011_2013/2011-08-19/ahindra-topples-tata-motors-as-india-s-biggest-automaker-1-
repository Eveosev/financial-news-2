Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) ,  India ’s
largest maker of  sport utility vehicles , toppled  Tata Motors
Ltd. (TTMT)  as the nation’s biggest automaker by market value after
slumping passenger car demand dragged down Tata’s shares.  Mahindra gained 0.2 percent to 718.5 rupees at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai, giving it a market capitalization of 441.1
billion rupees ($9.6 billion). Tata Motors, owner of the Jaguar
and  Land Rover  brands, fell 5.3 percent to 712.35 rupees,
valuing the company at 422.5 billion rupees.  Tata Motors’s Jaguar deliveries have declined this year as
the European debt crisis and signs of slowing economic growth in
the U.S. eroded demand for  luxury vehicles . The automaker, whose
overseas sales account for about 63 percent of total revenue,
has dropped 46 percent this year, while rival Mahindra, which
exports about 5 percent of its vehicles, has fallen 7.5 percent.  “Tata Motors, through Jaguar and Land Rover, has a high
exposure to  Europe  and  North America , where there is a lot of
economic uncertainty at the moment,” said Surjit Singh Arora, a
Mumbai-based analyst with Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. who has an
“accumulate” rating on both Tata Motors and Mahindra.
“Mahindra will continue to have a higher market capitalization
over Tata as long as the uncertainty remains.”  Reeling Markets  Tata Motors’s value overtook Mahindra’s in August 2009,
according to data on the Bloomberg. Tata Motors’s value last
fell below Mahindra’s in October 2008, when financial markets
were reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Tata Motors, which is also India’s biggest truck maker,
reported first-quarter profit of 20 billion rupees, lagging
behind the 21.6 billion-rupee median of 32 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Net income may fall 1.4 percent to 91.4
billion rupees in the year ending March 31, according to the
median estimate of 39 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Tata Motors global group sales in July fell 6 percent from
a year earlier to 85,392 vehicles, according to an e-mailed
statement on Aug. 16.  Mahindra reported first-quarter profit rose 8 percent to
6.05 billion rupees, matching analysts’ estimates, as it sold
more pick-up trucks and SUVs. Profit may increase 6.5 percent to
32.8 billion rupees this fiscal year, according to the median of
10 analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
