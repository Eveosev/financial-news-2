Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., a
Chinese maker of solar-power modules, rose 7.5 percent in early
 New York  trading after second-quarter profit exceeded analyst
estimates and a planned surge in 2011 shipments was reaffirmed.  Yingli, based in Baoding,  China , rose 42 cents to $6.05 per
American depositary receipt at 8:59 a.m. in premarket trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. At the close of regular trading
yesterday, the ADRs had dropped 43 percent this year.  Net income rose to $58.1 million, or 36 cents per ADR, from
$32.1 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier, the company said
today in a statement. Yingli was expected to earn 25 cents, the
average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Liansheng Miao said the company has
gained market share and delivered a record number of panels to
customers during the quarter even as lower prices and declining
incentives in  Europe  reduced guidance at competitors including
Suntech Power Holdings Co., the worldâ€™s largest manufacturer.  Yingli said panel deliveries this year will be in the range
of 1,700 megawatts to 1,750 megawatts, or more than 60 percent
higher than 2010 shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
