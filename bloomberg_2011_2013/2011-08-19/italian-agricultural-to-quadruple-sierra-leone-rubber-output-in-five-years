The Italian Agricultural Co., a
closely held producer of rubber in  Sierra Leone , plans to
quadruple output in five years by planting new trees in a bid to
revitalize the industry.  The company’s current output of 250 metric tons a month,
from both its own plantations and rubber bought from small-scale
farmers, will rise to 1,000 tons, Cheick Barrie, finance
administrator of the company, said in an interview Aug. 15 in
the eastern town of Small Bo.  Italian Agricultural has a three-year lease on two state-
owned plantations and a 50-year lease on another 10,000-acre
(4,045-hectare) plot, he said. The company will plant two
million trees over the next four to five years, he said.  The West African nation carved out rubber plantations
totaling 53,559 acres in the 1960s to develop the industry, said
Thomas Dickson Kallon, forest officer for Kenema District, in
the country’s  east . Less than 10 percent of the land was
cultivated, he said. In 1991, a plan to hand over control of the
state-owned rubber farms to the Sierra Leone Rubber Co. was
halted by the outbreak of a rebel uprising that led to a
devastating 11-year civil war.  Italian Agricultural sends its raw rubber to the  Firestone
Natural Rubber Co.  in neighboring Liberia to be processed, said
Barrie. The company plans to build stations in towns in the east
to buy rubber from farmers and its own processing plant, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
