University of Connecticut  athletic
director Jeff Hathaway retired after reaching a contract buyout
agreement, ending his eight-year tenure in the post.  “After 20 years of being associated with UConn, I felt the
time was right for me to pursue new challenges,” Hathaway said
in a statement posted today on the school’s website.  School President Susan Herbst said associate athletic
director Paul McCarthy will take over Hathaway’s
responsibilities until an interim director is selected.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
