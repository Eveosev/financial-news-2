New World Resources Plc, a central
European hard coal miner and coke producer, may say second-
quarter profit declined after a one-time gain from the sale of
an energy unit wasn’t repeated.  Net income probably fell to 80.9 million euros ($116
million) from 129.6 million euros a year earlier, according to
the median estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by the company.  NWR, based in Amsterdam, may say Ebitda, or earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, rose 51 percent to
166.5 million euros and revenue increased 17 percent to 452.9
million euros, according to the survey.  NWR sold its heating unit NWR Energy to Dalkia AS, a Czech
energy company, for about 122 million euros in January 2010. The
miner booked a gain of 82 million euros in the second quarter of
2010, J&T Banka AS analyst Bohumil Trampota wrote in a note to
clients on Aug. 19.  The company is scheduled to release earnings on Aug. 24
before the stock market opens.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
