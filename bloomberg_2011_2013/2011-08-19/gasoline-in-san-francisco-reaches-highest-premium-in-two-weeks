California-blend gasoline in  San
Francisco  strengthened to the highest premium versus futures in
two weeks on refinery outages and as fuel cargoes were scheduled
to leave the West Coast.  San Francisco Carbob’s premium widened 1.25 cents to 11.75
cents above gasoline futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 4:04 p.m. East Coast time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel jumped 18 cents this week amid
speculation that exports would limit supplies of the fuel.  Ships scheduled to deliver gasoline from the West Coast to
Mexico “put the numbers way out of whack this week,” said Bob
van der Valk, an independent fuel pricing analyst in Terry,
Montana.  Prices also rose as  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  ConocoPhillips (COP) 
and  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  reported equipment breakdowns at their
refineries in Washington state.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Portland , Oregon, was unchanged at 7.5 cents. The fuel reached
its highest premium in almost 10 months earlier this week.  Carbob in Los Angeles weakened 1.25 cents to a premium of
7.75 cents. The fuel yesterday reached its highest premium since
May 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
