Lending in Mexico won’t be stifled
by the  capital requirements  of banks with international
operations under Basel III rules, the National Banking and
Securities Commission said in a letter to  Reforma  newspaper,
saying a representative had been misquoted in a story published
Aug. 18 by the newspaper.  The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision has addressed
regulators’ concerns that international banks might demand more
capital from their Mexican units to meet requirements for the
capital they hold against their assets, Carlos Lopez-Moctezuma,
a spokesman for the Mexican commission, said in the letter, a
copy of which was provided to Bloomberg News.  The Basel rules on capital requirements to be implemented
in 2012 won’t have an effect on the strength of Mexico’s banking
system and won’t limit lending growth, the letter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
