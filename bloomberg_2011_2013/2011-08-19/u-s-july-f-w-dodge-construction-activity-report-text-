Following is the text of the monthly
McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge report.  July Construction Retreats 10 Percent  The value of new construction starts dropped 10% in July to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $394.7 billion, according to
McGraw-Hill Construction, a division of The McGraw-Hill
Companies. The decline followed a 15% gain in June, and returned
total construction to the lower end of its recent range. The
nonbuilding construction sector, comprised of public works and
electric utilities, fell back after a robust June that had been
lifted by the start of several large transmission line and power
plant projects. Nonresidential building also slipped back after
its improved pace in June. On the plus side, residential
building in July was able to show modest growth, helped by
continued strengthening for multifamily housing. For the
January-July period of 2011, total construction starts on an
unadjusted basis came in at $235.0 billion, down 6% from the
same period a year ago.  The July statistics produced a reading of 83 for the Dodge Index
(2000=100), down from 92 in June. During the first seven months
of 2011, the Dodge Index fluctuated within the range of 80 to 93.
The average for the Dodge Index for all of 2010 was 90. “The
construction start statistics continue to show an up-and-down
pattern, as sporadic gains have yet to make the transition to
more sustained expansion,” stated Robert A. Murray, vice
president of economic affairs for McGraw-Hill Construction.
“This behavior might be characterized as ‘bouncing along the
bottom,’ following the sharp downturn for construction starts
that took place in 2008 and 2009. Single family housing remains
stalled at a low volume, not able to perform its more typical
role of leading a construction upturn. The tight fiscal
conditions at the federal, state, and local levels of government
are restraining the public works and institutional building
sectors, and the recent debt ceiling agreement points toward
further restraint. While the commercial categories seem to have
bottomed out, the concern about a weakening U.S. economy will
likely delay any improvement for these project types in the near
term.”  Nonbuilding construction in July fell 23% to $126.2 billion
(annual rate). The electric utility category pulled back 69%,
after its robust volume in June that saw contracting soar 103%.
June had been boosted by the start of two large transmission
line projects as well as thirteen large power plants, valued
each at $100 million or greater. While July included the start
of several large electric utility projects, they were fewer in
number than what took place in June. There were four electric
utility projects in July valued each at $100 million or greater,
and they were the following - a $600 million natural gas-fired
power plant in  North Carolina , a $375 million transmission line
in  Utah , a $360 million wind farm in Utah, and a $242 million
wind farm in  Texas . The public works sector in July strengthened
20%, in a departure from what has been generally a downward
trend during 2011. Highway construction in July jumped 27%,
boosted by the start of the $575 million Capital Beltway project
in northern  Virginia . Bridge construction in July surged 47%,
aided by the start of a $98 million bridge replacement project
in Texas. The “miscellaneous” public works category, which
includes mass transit, advanced 32% in July with support coming
from the start of the $328 million Oakland Airport Connector
project in  California , and river/harbor development bounced back
29% after a subdued June. Two public works categories lost
momentum in July - sewers, down 2%; and water supply systems,
down 20%.  Nonresidential building, at $144.5 billion (annual rate),
dropped 6% in July due partly to the commercial building sector
retreating after its improved performance in June. The retail
categories in July continued to languish, with stores down 9%
and warehouses down 10%. Office construction in June had been
aided by the start of several large projects, including a $200
million office campus in the Houston (TX) area, but with fewer
large projects in July office construction descended 9%. The
largest office project to reach groundbreaking in July was $110
million for the office portion of a $350 million pharmaceutical
laboratory and office in Boston MA. Hotel construction in July
was down 32% from the previous month. Running counter to the
declines for commercial building in July was a substantial gain
for the manufacturing building category, which jumped 190%.
Large projects that lifted the July manufacturing amount were
groundbreaking for a $1.5 billion semiconductor plant in
Chandler AZ and the $225 million laboratory portion of the $350
million pharmaceutical laboratory and office in Boston MA.  The institutional side of the nonresidential market showed a
mixed performance by project type. Healthcare facilities dropped
55% in July after elevated activity in the previous two months.
Other July declines were reported for amusement-related projects,
down 45%; and the public buildings category, down 21%. On the
plus side, the educational building category climbed 12%, helped
by a $300 million construction project at the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York NY. July also included the start of
major high school construction projects, with the four largest
located in Arlington VA ($88 million), Chicago IL ($87 million),
Merced CA ($76 million), and Methuen MA ($75 million). Two of
the smaller institutional categories posted strong percentage
gains in July after a very weak June - transportation terminals,
up 44%; and churches, up 48%; although the levels for both of
these project types remain weak by recent historical standards.  Residential building in July grew 3% to $124.0 billion (annual
rate). Like the previous month, the upward push in July for
residential building came from multifamily housing, which
climbed 19%. Large multifamily projects that supported the July
gain included a $242 million apartment building in Long Island
City NY and a total of thirteen multifamily projects (mostly
apartment buildings), each with a construction start cost in the
range of $25 million to $55 million. The single family side of
the housing market slipped 1% in July, as it continues to remain
on hold at a depressed amount. July’s single family total showed
gains in the West (up 6%) and South Atlantic (up 1%) relative to
June, but declines in the South Central (down 3%), the Midwest
(down 5%), and the Northeast (down 6%). Murray noted, “To this
point, the only housing recovery has been on the multifamily
side of the market. Single family housing continues to be
weighed down by foreclosures, falling  home prices , and the
hesitation shown by potential homebuyers amidst uncertain
economic conditions.”  The 6% decline for total construction starts on an unadjusted
basis during the first seven months of 2011 was the result of
decreased activity across the three major sectors.
Nonresidential building was down 9% year-to-date, due to this
pattern by segment - commercial building, up 2%; manufacturing
building, up 143%; and institutional building, down 20%.
Residential building year-to-date dropped 8%, while nonbuilding
construction slipped 2%. By geography, total construction starts
during the first seven months of 2011 compared to last year
showed a gain for one region, the West, up 10%. Year-to-date
declines were reported for the other four regions - the South
Central, down 9%; the South Atlantic, down 10%; and the Midwest
and Northeast, each down 12%.
