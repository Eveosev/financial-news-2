Stagecoach Group Plc (SGC) , the operator
of Britain’s biggest rail-commuter franchise, split its stock
into new ordinary shares and so-called “D” shares as a prelude
to returning 340 million pounds ($532 million) to shareholders.  Following the receipt of investor approval for the plan on
Oct. 7, Stagecoach divided its existing stock into 576 million
ordinary shares, which began trading on the London Stock
Exchange at 8 a.m., and 720 million D shares, it said today.  Payments for the purchase of 75 percent of the D shares and
for a special dividend on the remaining quarter will be made on
Oct. 21, Perth, Scotland-based Stagecoach said in its statement.
The plan aims to return cash equal to about 20 percent of its
market value to investors, according to details issued Aug. 19.  Stagecoach fell as much as 5.6 percent and was trading 2.4
percent lower at 258.4 pence as of 11:49 a.m. in  London . That
values the owner of the South West Trains commuter route and
investor in Virgin Trains Ltd. at 1.49 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
