Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)  and  Acer Inc. (2353) 
may benefit if  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  goes ahead with plans to spin
off its personal-computer division, said Kirk Yang, an analyst
at Barclays Plc.  Asian computer makers may increase market share as Hewlett-
Packard and  Dell Inc. (DELL) , the industry’s top two producers, are
“showing flat growth and putting less emphasis on the PC
business,” Yang said in a note to clients today. Asustek
“would be one of the major beneficiaries,” along with Acer,
according to the note.  Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest computer maker,
announced a plan yesterday to overhaul its businesses, agreeing
to buy Autonomy Corp. for $10.3 billion and split off its PC
division.  Asustek was down 4.6 percent to NT$230 as of 10:44 a.m. in
Taipei trading. Acer was trading at NT$30.25, down 2.1 percent.  Sales for the period ending in October will be $32.1
billion to $32.5 billion,  Palo Alto , California-based Hewlett-
Packard said yesterday. That missed the average $34 billion
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Earnings excluding
some items will be $1.12 to $1.16 a share, compared with
analysts’ $1.31 average estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
