Turkey ’s lira rebounded against the
dollar as investors bought the currency that traded near the
weakest level in more than two years.  The lira gained 0.1 percent to 1.7822 per dollar at 5:30
p.m. in Istanbul, after falling to 1.7966. It reached 1.7994 on
Aug. 11, the weakest since March 2009. The lira’s 14 percent
decline this year makes it the worst performer among 25 major
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “I think everything started looking oversold, so there was
some reaction buying,” said Yarkin Cebeci, an Istanbul-based
economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The benchmark Istanbul National 100 Index erased an earlier
loss of as much as 3.9 percent to close 2.2 percent up, tracking
movements in global markets. In the U.S., the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rebounded from the lowest valuation levels since 2009,
offsetting concern that policy makers will not be able to
prevent an economic slowdown.  The Stoxx 600 Europe Index pared losses of as much as 3.6
percent to trade down 1 percent at 224.45 after European
monetary policy official Olli Rehn said the E.U. might consider
issuing joint euro bonds to stabilize euro-area markets.  Turkey’s central bank started selling dollars at daily
auctions on Aug. 5 to try and control the currency’s decline.
The bank sold $140 million today for lira, the most since the
auctions began. The Ankara-based bank has sold $100 million per
day during the past five days.  The bank’s foreign-currency reserves declined to $90.9
billion on Aug. 12 from $93 billion at the end of July, the
bank’s data showed on Aug. 18.  Two-year benchmark bonds yields dropped six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.84 percent, according to a Turk
Ekonomi Bankasi AS index of the securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
