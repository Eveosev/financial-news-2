Ben Roethlisberger  threw for two
touchdowns as the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Philadelphia
Eagles 24-14 in a National Football League preseason game.  The Eagles joined the  Green Bay Packers  and  New England
Patriots  as Super Bowl favorites with Las Vegas oddsmakers after
adding cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha, defensive tackle Cullen Jenkins and defensive end Jason Babin in free agency.
Philadelphia also acquired cornerback Dominique Rodgers- Cromartie and running back Ronnie Brown.  Roethlisberger connected with Antonio Brown on a 29-yard
scoring pass in the first quarter last night and hit Hines Ward
with a 20-yard touchdown toss in the second quarter at  Heinz
Field  in Pittsburgh. Byron Leftwich’s 20-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery with 18 seconds left in the first half gave the
Steelers a 21-0 lead.  Swayze Waters scored with a 30-yard field goal at the start
of the fourth quarter. The Eagles got on the scoreboard with
3:47 left in the game on Mike Kafka’s 14-yard pass to Gerald
Jones. Kafka found Jones again with a 7-yard touchdown pass with
19 seconds remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
