Medi-Clinic Corp., an operator of
private hospitals in  South Africa , said the government’s plan to
create a compulsory medical-insurance program won’t squeeze
profit margins.  Contributions to the national health insurance plan will be
used to improve the public health system, according to the
government. The nation is also considering a cap on prices
charged by private hospitals.  While there are “obviously many uncertainties” on
pricing, the Health Ministry’s draft policy released last week
doesn’t indicate a “a squeeze on margins or profitability,”
Koert Pretorius, chief executive officer of Medi-Clinic’s
southern Africa operation, said in Johannesburg today.  Medi-Clinic shares pared an earlier decline of 4.7 percent
to close 0.5 percent lower at 30.61 rand in Johannesburg.  Privately insured South Africans on average have access to
medical benefits worth six times more than those who rely on the
state, which serves 84 percent of the population of 50.6
million, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
