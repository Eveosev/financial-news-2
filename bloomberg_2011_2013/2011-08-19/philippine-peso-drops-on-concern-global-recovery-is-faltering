The Philippine peso fell to a one-
week low as concern that the global economic recovery is losing
traction damped demand for emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks slid to the lowest
level since September after Taiwan said yesterday growth eased
in the second quarter, joining  China , South Korea,  Hong Kong ,
Malaysia and  Singapore  in reporting the slowest expansions since
2009. Philippine benchmark five-year bond yields dropped for an
sixth day after Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said yesterday
the nation’s budget deficit is “way ahead of program.”  “Some hot money is going out because it’s risk aversion
again,” said Roland Avante, treasurer at Sterling Bank of  Asia 
in Manila. “Given the volatility in the global market, some
funds are cutting positions in emerging markets.”  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 42.643 per dollar as of
3:55 p.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency was little changed this week.  The yield on the 9.125 percent bonds due September 2016
dropped three basis points today and 20 basis points this week
to 4.67 percent, according to Amstel Financial Services. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Increased  tax revenue  and lower spending helped narrow the
first-half deficit to 17.2 billion pesos ($404 million), below
the 152 billion peso target, the government said Aug. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
