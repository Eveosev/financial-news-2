Sadia SA, the poultry exporter
acquired by  BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3) , resolved a lawsuit filed in
the U.S. accusing the company of misleading investors about its
financial health and use of currency hedges.  The parties notified U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin
in federal court in Manhattan that they had reached a
resolution, the judge wrote in an order filed today. Scheindlin
ordered the case discontinued with prejudice. Either side may
apply for restoration of the action if the settlement isn’t
carried out, she said.  Terms of the settlement weren’t revealed in the order.  The investors sued Sadia, then Brazil’s second-biggest food
company, in November 2008. The company was accused of failing to
tell holders of its American depositary receipts that it had
entered into currency derivative contracts to hedge against U.S.
dollar exposure that were larger than necessary, which the
plaintiffs said violated company policy.  Brasil Foods , the world’s largest poultry exporter, agreed
to buy Sadia in 2009 after the rival booked more than 3 billion
reais ($1.88 billion) of wrong-way currency bets the previous
year. The $3.8 billion takeover was given conditional approval
by regulators last month.  The case is Westchester Putnam Heavy & Highway Laborers
Local 60 Benefit Funds v. Sadia SA, 08-cv-9528, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
