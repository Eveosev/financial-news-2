The liquidator of Bernard L. Madoff’s firm sued Lion Global Investors Ltd. and at least six
other companies to recover at least $172.8 million they
allegedly received from investments made with the con man by
Fairfield Sentry Ltd., according to court filings.  Irving Picard , the trustee overseeing the liquidation of
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, claims Fairfield, a
so-called feeder fund to the Madoff company, transferred funds
to Lion Global, a Singapore-based asset management company,
Quilvest Finance Ltd., a unit of Luxembourg-based investor
Quilvest SA, and five other entities, according to filings in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  Seven complaints filed yesterday seek at least
$172.8 million for victims of Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Picard said
he has the authority to take back the transfers as he works to
recover money for Madoff customers. Madoff is serving a 150-year
sentence in a prison in North Carolina.  Lion Global is 70 percent owned by Great Eastern Holdings
Limited and 30 percent owned by Orient Holdings Private Ltd., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.,
according to its website.  Mae Wong, a spokeswoman for Lion Global in  Singapore ,
didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail seeking comment on the
lawsuit or return a call to her office phone.  A call to Quilvest USA in  New York  seeking comment on the
lawsuit after regular business hours wasn’t immediately
returned.  The case is Picard v. Lion Global, 11-2540,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
