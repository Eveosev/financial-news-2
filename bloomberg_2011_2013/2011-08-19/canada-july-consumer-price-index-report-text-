The following is the text of
Canada's consumer price index report for July released
by  Statistics Canada .  Consumer prices rose 2.7% in the 12 months to July,
primarily the result of higher prices for gasoline and
food purchased from stores. This follows a 3.1% increase
in June and a 3.7% advance in May.  On July 1, 2010, the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) came
into effect in Ontario and British Columbia. As well, Nova
Scotia increased its HST by two percentage points. July
2011 marks the first month for which the calculation for
the 12-month rate of change in consumer prices compares
two months which both include the July 2010 tax changes.  Energy prices advanced 12.9% during the 12 months to
July, following a 15.7% increase in June. On a year-over-
year basis, gasoline prices rose 23.5%, compared with the
28.5% gain in June. In contrast, natural gas prices fell.  Food prices rose 4.3% in the 12 months to July,
matching the increase in June.  Excluding food and energy, the  Consumer Price Index 
(CPI) increased 1.2% in the 12 months to July, after
advancing 1.4% in June.  Seasonally adjusted monthly CPI increases  On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, consumer prices

includes gasoline, remained unchanged following a 2.4%
decline in June.  The seasonally adjusted food index continued to rise in
July, increasing 0.5% after advancing 0.3% in June. The
shelter index rose 0.4% while the recreation, education
and reading index increased 0.2%.  12-month change: Prices for most major components advance

to July, following a 7.0% gain in June. In addition to
paying more for gasoline, consumers paid more in passenger
vehicle insurance premiums and for air transportation.

prices for food purchased from stores rose 5.1% in the 12
months to July after advancing 4.8% in June. Compared with

fresh vegetables, bakery products, and fresh fruit. They
also paid 2.2% more for food purchased from restaurants.  Shelter costs rose 1.3% in the 12 months to July,
