AAA Auto Group NV (AAA) , a chain of used-
 car dealerships  in central Europe, said profit rose 38 percent
in the first half amid a stronger economy and willingness by
customers to use credit for purchases.  Net income from continuing operations in the six months to
June 30 rose to 3.2 million euros ($4.5 million), or 4.92 euros
per share, from a restated 2.9 million euros in the year-ago
period, the company said today on its website. Revenue rose 42
percent to 130 million euros.  The gradual economic recovery spurred buyersâ€™ willingness
to take on credit to finance their purchases and buy more
expensive cars, which boosted margins, the Amsterdam-based
company said. Sales of other financial services such as
insurance also grew, AAA said.  The total price of cars sold rose 22.1 percent, the company
said.  Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, rose 21 percent to 7.4 million euros.  AAA said it refinanced part of its long-term debt at the
end of June, 2011 to reduce the average  interest rate .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
