Serbia’s government said it will
free up a “considerable” amount of assets held by state-run
companies and offer them to investors.  The changes will come as part of a proposed public property
law, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said today in Belgrade
while presenting the draft. The government will also let
municipalities and the northern Vojvodina province own land,
buildings and some infrastructure in their territories, instead
of having only the “right of use” that has limited options for
managing assets, he said.  “Serbia will finally and systematically determine and
define who owns what in the country,” Djelic said. Major state-
run companies, such as Elektroprivreda Srbije power producer and
railway operator  Zeleznice Srbije , will have to prove which
assets they “really need” and let the state dispose of the
rest, he said.  Serbia is changing its laws as part of its preparations for
eventual membership in the European Union. It hopes to become an
EU candidate this year and start entry talks. The proposed law
and a related one on compensating victims of Communist-era
property confiscations will be adopted next month, Djelic said.  Serbia may attract $2 billion in foreign direct investment
this year, which should support an expected 3 percent economic
growth, the central bank said earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
