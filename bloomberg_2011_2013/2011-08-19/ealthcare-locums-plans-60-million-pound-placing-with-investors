Healthcare Locums Plc (HLO) , a U.K.
recruiter of health-care staff, is placing 60 million pounds
($99 million) of shares with investors and making an open offer
of as much as 4.25 million pounds in a refinancing.  The aim is to secure the company’s finances and to enable
trading of its shares on  London ’s Alternative Investment Market,
suspended in January, to be resumed, Healthcare Locums said
today in a statement on the Regulatory News Service.  Toscafund, an existing shareholder, has agreed to buy
336,375,000 new common shares for 33.6 million pounds and ACE
Ltd. will pay 13.16 million pounds for 131,625,000 shares. The
refinancing, which also includes a debt-for-equity swap and debt
repayment and reorganization, depends on shareholders’ approval
at the annual meeting, the company said.  The shares were suspended after the company said it was
investigating “serious accounting irregularities.” On June 29,
Chairman Peter Sullivan said a “material amount” of profit
would have to be written back from earlier years because of
incorrect accounting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
