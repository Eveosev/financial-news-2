Coal inventories at leading ports in
 Europe  climbed to this year’s highest level as transportation
costs rose.  Stockpiles at Europees Massagoed-Overslagbedrijf BV, or
Emo, the largest coal terminal in Rotterdam, come to 3.14
million tons, according to Elias Chibani, a trader based in
Amsterdam with the energy-trading unit of Vattenfall AB, the
largest Nordic utility. They total 1.75 million tons at the OBA
terminal at Amsterdam, he said.  “That is the highest stocking level since the beginning of
this year,” Chibani said by phone today. End users prefer to
keep coal at ports because of elevated transportation expenses
caused by low water levels in the Rhine River, according to a
report by  Barclays Capital  today.  Benchmark European coal prices closed at $126 a metric ton,
unchanged from yesterday.  “There are more sellers than buyers now, after the
restocking by utilities in the past few weeks,” said Chibani.  To contact the reporter on this story:
