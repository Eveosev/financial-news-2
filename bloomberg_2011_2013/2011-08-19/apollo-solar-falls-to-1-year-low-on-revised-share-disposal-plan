Apollo Solar Energy Technology
Holdings Ltd. (566) , which makes equipment to produce thin-film solar
modules, fell to a one-year low in Hong Kong trading after a
shareholder canceled the floor price for a potential sale.  The stock dropped 20 percent, the biggest intra-day decline
since Oct. 9, 2009, to HK$0.191, and closed at HK$0.193. That
compares with the benchmark  Hang Seng Index ’s 3.1 percent fall.  China Gogreen Assets Investment Ltd. (397) ’s board said under a
revised proposal that the new minimum price won’t be less than
90 percent of the average closing price of the Apollo shares for
five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the day the
sale takes place, according to its filing to the Hong Kong stock
exchange yesterday.  The company originally set an effective purchase cost of
each Apollo share at HK$0.50 in May. It held about 7.45 percent
of the issued share capital of Apollo at the end of last month.  China Gogreen amended the disposal plan to take into
account “the current  market sentiment  and the prevailing market
price of the Apollo shares.” The proposal revision will be
presented to shareholders for consideration.  The disposal price will be paid in cash, China Gogreen
said. Apollo is based in Hong Kong.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
