Jeff Quinney and Tommy Gainey, who
are both seeking their first win on golf’s U.S. PGA Tour, shot
rounds of 7-under-par 63 to share a one-shot lead at the
Wyndham Championship, the last regular-season tournament.  Gainey matched his career-best round and Quinney had five
birdies in a row, and eight in total, at  Sedgefield Country
Club  in Greensboro,  North Carolina , yesterday to lead
Australian  Stuart Appleby . Ten players including Paul Casey,
Ernie Els,  Jim Furyk  and Vijay Singh are a further shot back.  A win for Quinney would earn him a place in the first of
four playoff tournaments for the  FedEx Cup . The top 125 players
on the money list qualify for  the Barclays , which begins Aug.
25 at Plainfield Country Club in Edison,  New Jersey . Three more
events follow, culminating in the Tour Championship. The winner
of the FedEx Cup receives a $10 million bonus.  Gainey is 40th in the FedEx Cup standings. Casey, No. 17
in the  Official World Golf Ranking , is 147th, while Els is
126th.  ‘My playoffs started this week,” Els told reporters. “If
I don’t play well this week, I’m not advancing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
