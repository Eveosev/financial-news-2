A bomb explosion killed at least 53
people at prayer in a village mosque in northwestern  Pakistan ’s
border zone with  Afghanistan , a rescue service said.  The bomb erupted at the end of the main weekly prayer
service at the mosque in Ghundi, a village in the ethnic Pashtun
tribal region near the Khyber Pass. It left 117 people injured
and rescue workers were moving victims to hospitals in the
nearby provincial capital of Peshawar, said Mujahid Khan, a
spokesman of the  Edhi Foundation  rescue service.  The blast was triggered by a suicide bomber, said Sadeeq
Khan, a political officer of the Khyber district administration,
who was reached by phone.  The attack was the deadliest in the district since a bomb
in another mosque killed 70 during a weekly prayer service in
March 2009. Guerrilla groups under local tribal leaders in the
Khyber district have fought for dominance since 2005. The
district straddles the main road from  Peshawar  to the Khyber
Pass, which is used by  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  forces
in Afghanistan as their main overland supply route.  The region has suffered dozens of attacks on mosques in
recent decades, most of them related to conflicts between the
Sunni majority and minority Shiite Muslims.  No group claimed responsibility for today’s attack.  The device detonated as Farooq Khalil and other worshippers
were starting to walk out of the mosque, he said in a phone
interview. “I went back to help my friends, but I only saw
bones and flesh and blood everywhere,” Khalil said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
