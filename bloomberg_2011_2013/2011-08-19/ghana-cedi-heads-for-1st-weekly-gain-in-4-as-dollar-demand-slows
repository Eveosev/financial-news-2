Ghana ’s cedi headed for its first
weekly advance in four against the dollar as demand for the U.S.
currency by companies slowed and the central bank sold the
greenback.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.5265 per dollar by 1:20 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, extending its increase this week to 0.9
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This week we’ve seen the cedi recover from some of its
losses last week, mainly because corporate demand for dollars
decreased,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the local unit
of Barclays Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview today. “The
central bank’s presence on the market on Wednesday also
contributed to the local currency’s stability.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
