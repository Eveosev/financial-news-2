Peru’s  Transport Ministry  suspended
all flights by local carrier Peruvian Airlines after it failed
to meet safety standards, daily  El Comercio  reported, citing a
statement from the ministry.  The airline, the second-largest carrier in Peru after  Lan
Airlines SA (LAN) , has reported engine problems on two flights this
year, according to the Lima-based newspaper.  Peruvian Airlines , which started operating in 2009 with a
fleet of five Boeing 737-200 and 737-300 jets, held a 16 percent
market share, El Comercio said. It’s the third Peruvian airline
to be shut down in eight years, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
