Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  declined to offer states more compensation for the
economic costs of the nation’s plan to place a price on carbon-
dioxide emissions, said state premiers.  “I’m concerned about the impact on our publicly owned
generators,” New South Wales Premier Barry O’Farrell said
today, according to a transcript of a press conference in
Canberra, the nation’s capital. “If you’re privately owned, if
you’re foreign-owned, you get compensation. If you’re publicly
owned you don’t. We’re going to lose A$700 million ($726
million) in dividends and tax equivalents,” he said.  O’Farrell said that the prime minister had declined to give
in to the states’ requests for compensation. “This woman’s not
for turning,” he said.  Australia  is debating a proposal by the government to put
in place an emissions-trading system that would set a minimum
price of A$23 on each metric ton of greenhouse-gas emissions
from utilities and large industrial companies.  Victoria state is inadequately compensated by “hundreds of
millions of dollars, and the prime minister’s made it clear that
there’s no further compensation,” said that state’s Premier Ted Baillieu. Gillard said the states and the federal government
were “at odds on the analysis,” according to the transcript.  To contact the reporter on this story:
