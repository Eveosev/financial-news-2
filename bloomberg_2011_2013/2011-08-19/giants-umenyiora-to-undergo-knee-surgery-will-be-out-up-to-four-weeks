New York Giants defensive end Osi Umenyiora will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right knee
and miss the next three-to-four weeks, the National Football
League team said in a news release.  Umenyiora practiced with the Giants this week after
spending most of his time at training camp on a stationary bike.
The 29-year-old, a two-time Pro Bowl selection who has spent his
seven-year career with the Giants, reported to camp July 30
after offseason hip surgery and a contract dispute.  Giants General Manager Jerry Reese said Umenyiora had
swelling in the knee and decided to “get it cleaned up now
because he is looking forward to playing this season.”  Umenyiora said he wanted to have the surgery now, to avoid
the problem flaring up at “a more crucial part of our season.”
He told the  Associated Press  this week that he would play under
the terms of his existing contract, which will pay him $7.1
million over the next two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
