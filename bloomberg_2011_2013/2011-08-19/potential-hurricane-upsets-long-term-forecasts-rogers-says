A potential hurricane nearing the
U.S. next week has eroded a forecaster’s confidence in his long-
term predictions into early September.  The storm, 1,125 miles east of the Lesser Antilles, has a
30 percent chance of becoming a tropical system in the next two
day’s, according to the National Hurricane Center’s 5 a.m.
advisory. That system may develop into a hurricane and menace
the eastern U.S. starting late next week.  The storm is making it difficult to predict temperatures
for the South, Midwest and East from Aug. 26 onward, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland . Natural gas traders use those predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations.  “We lower our confidence today in accordance with this
chaotic situation,” Rogers wrote in a note to clients.  The hurricane center is tracking a second area of disturbed
weather 325 miles east-southeast of the Cape Verde Islands that
has a 40 percent chance of developing in the next 48 hours.  A tropical depression just off the coast of Honduras won’t
affect the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
