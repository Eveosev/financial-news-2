Volkswagen AG (VOW)  cancelled three
planned days of extra production because of a slowdown in car
sales, Valor Economico reported, citing Alexander Seitz, vice-
president of procurement for the South American region.  Volkswagen would have produced 3,000 cars during the three
Saturdays in July and August, according the the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper. The company still plans three Saturdays of extra
production in the period from September to November, Valor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
