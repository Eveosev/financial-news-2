Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy
chairman of  Russia ’s central bank, expressed caution about
giving additional liquidity to the market in an  interview  with
Kommersant today.  It would be “untimely” to offer additional liquidity,
hence the bank has preferred to raise rates in recent years,
Ulyukayev said in the interview. Too much liquidity causes
“unwise spending,” including poor quality investments and
“incorrect budget liabilities,” he said.  Asked about Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s comments last
week that the government was ready to provide liquidity,
Ulyukayev responded that the central bank may provide banks with
“any rational volume of funds” in the short term as necessary.
He said this could overcome local difficulties for several
months, but not solve the “global problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
