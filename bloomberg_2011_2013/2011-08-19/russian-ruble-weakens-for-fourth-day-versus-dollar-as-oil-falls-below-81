The ruble strengthened against the
dollar, snapping a three-day decline, amid speculation exporters
are converting foreign currency to pay taxes.  Russia ’s currency added 0.2 percent to close at 29.04 per
dollar by 7 p.m. in Moscow, bringing its advance this week to
0.7 percent. The ruble dropped 0.4 percent to 41.8898 per euro,
its lowest close since Aug. 11, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Those movements left the ruble steady at 34.8224
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Exporters in the world’s biggest oil-producing nation need
to pay a total 330 billion rubles ($11 billion) of value-added,
excise and natural resources taxes next week, according to HSBC
Holdings Plc estimates. Crude, Russia’s chief export earner,
climbed 1 percent to $83.17 per barrel in  New York  today as the
declining dollar boosted the appeal of commodities as
investments.  “The ruble is being supported by the exporters, which are
selling foreign currency in preparation for next week’s tax
payments,” Maxim Oreshkin, the Moscow-based chief strategist
for Russia and the former  Soviet Union  at Credit Agricole CIB,
said by e-mail.  Oil prices  in New York have slumped 13 percent in August
amid concern debt crises in the U.S. and  Europe  are boosting
chances the global economy will enter a recession, cutting
demand for energy. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend,
fell 2.9 percent to $106.10 a barrel today, and has lost 8.3
percent in the month.  Further Declines  Should crude continue to fall, the ruble will drop another
3.5 percent by the end of the year to 36.1 versus the basket,
according to Oreshkin. Russia’s central bank has used the basket
since 2005 to manage swings in the ruble that reduce the
competitiveness of exporters. The basket rate is calculated by
multiplying the dollar-ruble rate by 0.55, the euro-ruble rate
by 0.45, then adding them together.  Non-deliverable forwards show the ruble at 29.3869 per
dollar in three months, compared with 29.4816 on Aug. 18. The
contracts provide a guide to currency movements and interest-
rate differentials and allow companies to hedge against
volatility.  HSBC Holdings Inc. is predicting the ruble will drop to
36.9 by November or December, analysts led by  Alexander Morozov ,
the bank’s chief economist in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed
research note today.  “We believe the risks for the ruble are clearly on the
downside,” the note said.  The ruble’s rally to 32.9552 versus the basket on July 28,
its strongest closing level since 2008 “was a Pyrrhic
victory,” according to the HSBC analysts. “Now, the time has
come for the ruble to weaken.”  Russia’s ruble-denominated Eurobond due in 2018 dropped for
a second straight day, pushing the yield up seven basis points
to 7.097 percent. Dollar-denominated debt due 2020 gained,
leaving the yield three basis points lower at 4.122 percent
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
