Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  doesn’t want to use the government’s stake in refiner Mol
Nyrt. to help finance the budget in an emergency,  Nepszabadsag 
reported, without citing anyone.  Mihaly Varga, Orban’s chief of staff, has said the state
may sell part of its Mol holding early next year if the
country’s finances are at risk, according to the newspaper.  The government would sell at most a “small” part of the
stake even if there were a need for funds, Nepszabadsag added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
