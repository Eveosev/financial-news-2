OAO Rosneft,  Russia â€™s largest oil
producer, sank to its lowest in a week as crude tumbled below
$80 a barrel in New York.  The shares fell 2.2 percent to 199.08 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the lowest since Aug. 11. The stock pared
earlier losses of as much as 5.7 percent.  Oil futures fell below $80 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  for the first time since Aug. 10 on concern
that the global economic recovery is fading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
