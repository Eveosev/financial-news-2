U.S. aviation inspectors will be
barred for two years from working for the airlines they oversaw
to prevent ethical breaches that may undercut safety, according
to the  Federal Aviation Administration .  The rule is designed to prevent conflicts of interest that
may undercut the government’s oversight of airlines, charter
operators and maintenance facilities, the FAA said in a  notice 
posted today on the Federal Register’s website.  Congressional investigators said in 2008 that  Southwest
Airlines Co. (LUV)  had made almost 60,000 flights on Boeing 737s that
had not received mandatory inspections for fuselage cracks.  Investigators found that a former FAA inspector who had
gone to work for Southwest had too close of a relationship with
FAA managers overseeing the airline.  Southwest agreed to pay a $7.5 million fine for the missed
inspections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
