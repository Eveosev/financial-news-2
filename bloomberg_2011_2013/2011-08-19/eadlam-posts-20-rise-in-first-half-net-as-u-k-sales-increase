Headlam Group Plc (HEAD) , a distributor of
carpets and tiles, said first-half profit climbed 20 percent as
like-for-like sales increased in the U.K.  Net income for the six months to June 30 rose to 7.3
million pounds ($12 million) from 6.1 million pounds a year
earlier, the Birmingham, England-based company said today in a
statement distributed by the Regulatory News Service. Revenue
gained 5.5 percent to 269 million pounds.  “Due to the benefit of our supplier relationships and
continued positive trading from our customers, revenue
achievement since the period end has given a good start to the
second half,” Chief Executive Officer Tony Brewer said in the
statement. “Whilst market conditions remain challenging, we are
currently confident of achieving our revised objectives for the
year.”  First-half revenue in continental  Europe  declined by 4.5
percent on “challenging” conditions in Switzerland, the
company said.  Headlam raised its interim dividend by 12 percent to 430
pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
