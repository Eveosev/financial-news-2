Chile ’s peso rose, extending a
weekly gain, as copper advanced, strengthening the country’s
terms of trade.  The peso climbed 0.4 percent to 468.39 pesos per  U.S.
dollar  at 2 p.m. New York time, from 470.41 yesterday. The
currency rose 0.5 percent during the week.  “Copper has strengthened a little bit, which helps the
peso,” Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredora de
Bolsa, said in a telephone interview from Santiago. “The dollar
has also weakened some, which is favorable for the peso’s
exchange rate.”  The U.S. dollar fell 0.4 percent against the euro and 0.9
percent against the Swiss franc. Copper, which accounts for half
of Chile’s exports, climbed 0.2 percent to $3.99 per pound in
 New York .  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 4.75 percent, the lowest level in six
months.  The yield on Chile’s benchmark dollar denominated
 government bonds  due in 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.10 percent.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 468.93 pesos per
U.S. dollar for $50 million today, part of its $12 billion
effort to limit the peso’s gains, according to data posted on
the bank’s website.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
