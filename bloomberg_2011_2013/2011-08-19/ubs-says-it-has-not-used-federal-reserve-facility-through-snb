UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest banks, said they didn’t borrow from the
U.S. Federal Reserve through the Swiss central bank.  The Federal Reserve lent the Swiss National Bank $200
million through a swap arrangement for the week ending Aug. 17,
the New York Fed reported yesterday.  The transaction was the first time the program, under which
the Fed lends dollars to central banks in other countries that
in turn lend to commercial banks, has been used since March,
when the  European Central Bank  tapped $70 million.  UBS said in an e-mailed statement that “rumors” it used
the facility are “completely unfounded” and the bank “has not
made use of the Fed facility through the SNB.”  “Credit Suisse hasn’t made use of the Swiss National
Bank’s U.S. dollar swap facility at the  Federal Reserve  Board,”
the bank said in a separate e-mailed statement. “Credit Suisse
is among the most conservatively funded banks in the industry.
Our funding and liquidity positions are very strong in all major
currencies and especially” in U.S. dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
