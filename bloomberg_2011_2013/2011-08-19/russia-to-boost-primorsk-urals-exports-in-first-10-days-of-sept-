Russia , the worldâ€™s largest oil
producer, will increase exports of Urals crude from its Baltic
Sea port of Primorsk in the first 10 days of September to 23
cargoes, from 21 in the month-earlier period, a preliminary
loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Shipments will total 2.3 million metric tons, or 16.9
million barrels, according to the plan.  Urals exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  for the
same period will be unchanged at 10 cargoes, including four
140,000-ton shipments, one 145,000-ton consignment and five
80,000-ton lots, the plan showed.  The shipping plan for all of September will be released
later this month.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
