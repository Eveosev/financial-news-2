The youth wing of  South Africa ’s
ruling  African National Congress  will organize protest marches
across the country as it pushes its proposals to nationalize
banks and mines and take land without compensation.  The ANC Youth League “will mobilise” young people,
unemployed youth and informal-settlement dwellers to “fight
against economic oppression” and march to the stock exchange in
Johannesburg, the head office of the Chamber of Mines, Agri SA
and the Union Buildings in Pretoria, it said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  More details will be provided on Sept. 12, the ANCYL said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
