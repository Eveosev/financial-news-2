Mark Teixeira ,  Nick Swisher  and
Andruw Jones hit home runs as the New York Yankees beat the
Minnesota Twins 8-4.  The Yankees remain a half game ahead of the Red Sox in
Major League Baseball’s American League East division after
Boston last night defeated the Kansas City Royals 4-3.  CC Sabathia earned his 17th win of the season as he allowed
10 hits and four runs, while striking out nine in seven innings
at Target Field in Minneapolis.  The Yankees took the lead in the first inning when  Eduardo Nunez  scored on Brett Gardner’s sacrifice fly. Teixeira notched
his 33rd home run of the season in the third. Two innings later,
Swisher had a two-run homer and Jones hit a solo home run. Jones
and Nunez scored in the ninth on Francisco Cervelli’s infield
single.  The Yankees got 15 hits off five Twins pitchers, who only
struck out three batters.  At Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, Dustin Pedroia drove in three runs for the  Red Sox , who improved to 75-
48. The Yankees are 75-47.  To contact the reporter on this story:
