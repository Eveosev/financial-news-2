Anoop Kumar Gupta, joint managing
director at  KRBL Ltd. (KRB) , an Indian rice exporter, comments on
outlook for shipment of basmati rice and sales to Iran.  India, the world’s second-largest rice producer, may next
week consider allowing additional rice exports, Trade Minister
 Anand Sharma  told reporters today in  New Delhi .  Gupta spoke in a phone interview from New Delhi today.  On export prospects:  “This year export is a little bit under pressure and that
is because of problems in Iran. There are payment problems with
Iran. Because of the U.S. sanctions, there are lots of payment
issues and people don’t pay on time. Payments are diverted
through Dubai. Last year 900,000 tons were exported, but this
year it should be less than last year. Export to Iran is 30
percent of total export from  India .”  On demand:  “Basmati is fine rice and a commodity without which people
cannot survive. India and Pakistan are the only countries which
produce basmati. We have a monopoly position in global market.
So I think current demand will sustain.”  On prices:  “ The price of basmati is $1,000 per ton. I think this is
the least it will be. Prices will go up in the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
