A tropical depression off eastern
Central America is approaching land and will pass over  Honduras ,
while Hurricane Greg will weaken in the Pacific as it moves
farther out to sea, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  Tropical Depression Six is 55 miles (90 kilometers) from
Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Honduras-Nicaragua border, and will
move over Honduras’s northern coast today and tomorrow before
reaching Belize and  Guatemala , the NHC said in an  advisory  at 8
a.m. Miami time. While its 35 mile-per-hour winds are nearing
tropical-storm strength, it’s not expected to intensify.  Hurricane Greg, rated Category 1 on the five-step Saffir-
Simpson scale, has winds of 75 mph and will weaken as it moves
farther into the Pacific, the center  said .  In the Atlantic, two storm systems are moving toward the
Caribbean, both with a “medium” chance of becoming a cyclone
in the next two days, the center  said . The first, 900 miles east
of the Lesser Antilles, is showing signs of “organization,”
and the second is about halfway between  Africa ’s west coast and
the Cape Verde Islands, the NHC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
