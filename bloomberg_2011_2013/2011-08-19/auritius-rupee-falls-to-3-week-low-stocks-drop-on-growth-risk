Mauritius’s rupee sank the most in
three weeks against the dollar and stocks had a sixth week of
declines as a slowdown in the global economy curbs appetite for
riskier, frontier-market assets.  The currency depreciated as much as 1.6 percent, the most
since July 28, and traded 0.7 percent down at 27.95 per dollar
by 5:12 p.m. in the capital, Port Louis, extending its drop this
week to 0.2 percent. The 38-member SEMDEX index fell for a third
day, dropping 1.3 percent to 1,920.16.  State Bank  of Mauritius
Ltd., the country’s second-largest lender by market value,
slumped 2.8 percent to 87.50 rupees, the weakest since Aug. 9.  Emerging-market stocks fell for a second day as Morgan
Stanley yesterday lowered its forecast for global growth this
year, citing an “insufficient” policy response to Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis, weakened confidence and the prospect of
fiscal tightening.  “A probable slowdown in the global economy could impact on
Mauritius’s key sectors such as tourism, textiles and financial
services activities,” Imrith Ramtohul, a senior investment
manager who helps oversee 6 billion rupees ($212.8 million) at
Mauritius Union Group, said by phone today. “The volatility
seems to be overdone at times, taking into account the good
fundamentals of leading companies in the country. Mauritian
stocks are quite correlated with what’s happening in the major
market.”  Europe , Mauritius’s biggest trading partner, is the
country’s largest source of tourists, with a share of 64 percent
of total arrivals, according to the  Central Statistics Office .  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd., the largest Mauritian leisure
operator by market value, retreated 2.4 percent to 83 rupees,
the lowest close since March 2009, and Naiade Resorts Ltd., the
third-biggest tourism company, declined 2.1 percent to 28.50
rupees.  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.28 to 27.4451
rupees, while the selling price was 28.7425 per dollar, versus
28.7029 on Aug. 18, according to indicative exchange rates
published today on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
