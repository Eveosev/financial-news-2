Kenyan lawmakers approved a bill
that will enable the government to control the prices of goods
including corn flour, wheat, rice, sugar, kerosene, diesel,
cooking oil and gasoline, the Standard reported.  In terms of the proposed law, which has yet to be signed by
President Mwai Kibaki, the countryâ€™s finance minsiter must
consult with businesses before fixing any prices, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Last year, Kibaki rejected an initial version of the bill
saying it was inconsistent with economic liberalization, the
newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
