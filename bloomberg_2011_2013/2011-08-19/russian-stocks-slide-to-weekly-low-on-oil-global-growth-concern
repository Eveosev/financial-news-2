Russian stocks slid to their lowest
in more than a week on concern slowing global economic growth
will damp appetite for commodities.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 1 percent to 1,438.74 by the 6:45 p.m.
close in Moscow. That is the lowest since Aug. 10, after paring
an earlier loss of as much as 4.5 percent. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s
largest oil producer, fell 2.2 percent. OAO Sberbank, the
country’s biggest lender, retreated 3.4 percent. OAO Severstal,
the nation’s biggest miner, slid 1 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index lost 0.6 percent to 1,575.33, paring an
earlier decline of as much as 4.2 percent.  Crude for September delivery lost as much as $3.21, or 3.9
percent, to $79.17 a barrel in  New York  before erasing losses by
the close of the Russian market. Citigroup Inc. cut its
forecasts for U.S. expansion, while Morgan Stanley lowered
targets for stock indexes in Indonesia and  Singapore . Regulators
from the U.S.,  South Korea  and  Sweden  said the market turmoil
posed further risks to growth, after data yesterday showed
American jobless claims rose and a measure of manufacturing
contracted.  “SOS calls from markets have fallen on deaf ears at
central banks in  Europe  and the U.S. who, to be fair, have a
limited range of options at their disposal,” Julian Rimmer,
director of emerging-market sales at CF Global Trading in
 London , said in e-mailed comments today.  Growth Forecast  Citigroup cut its U.S. economic growth estimate to 1.6
percent in 2011 from 1.7 percent, and lowered its forecast for
2012 to 2.1 percent from 2.7 percent. U.S. initial jobless
claims climbed by 9,000 to 408,000 in the week ended Aug. 13,
topping the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
for a rise to 400,000.  The Micex’s 3.7 percent retreat yesterday was its steepest
slide since Aug. 10. The benchmark index halted trading for more
than an hour for “technical reasons,” according to spokesman
Nikita Bekasov. The gauge is heading for its fourth consecutive
weekly decline.  Yesterday’s sell-off was caused by “worries of a mini-
Lehman moment in the eurozone banking system” and a loss of
confidence among investors in the ability of policy makers to
resolve the debt and banking crisis, Neil Mackinnon, an
economist at VTB Capital, wrote in a report today.  The Micex slumped 7.3 percent last week after  Standard &
Poor’s  downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time and
Europe’s debt crisis spread. The gauge has dropped 15 percent
since the start of the year and currently trades at 4.1 times
earnings. That compares with a 23 percent slide for  Brazil ’s
Bovespa Index, which trades at 8.1 times earnings, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Investors withdrew $309 million from Russia-focused equity
funds in the week to Aug. 17 according to UralSib Financial
Corp., citing data from EPFR Global. In the prior week, EPFR
said investors withdrew $412 million, the biggest Russian
outflow in more than five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
