Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) 
called off plans with  Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP)  to build a
584-mile pipeline from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to Houston because it
couldn’t get sufficient terms on shipping agreements.  The companies announced a 50-50 joint venture in April to
build a 400,000 barrel-a-day pipeline to carry oil to Houston-
area refineries. The companies said at the time construction was
dependent on getting the needed shipper commitments.  Though the pipeline generated “significant shipper
interest,” the companies weren’t able to secure the terms they
needed to make the pipeline commercially viable, Enterprise said
in a statement after the close of trading today.  Cushing is the pricing point for West Texas Intermediate,
or WTI, the benchmark U.S. crude. WTI has been trading at a
discount to imported oil because rising U.S. and Canadian
onshore production has created a glut at Cushing, stranding
supplies.  A spokesperson for  Energy Transfer  could not immediately be
reached for comment.  Crude oil for September delivery dropped 12 cents to $82.26
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Aug. 9. Prices fell 3.7 percent this week and
are down 10 percent this year. The more actively traded October
contract fell 10 cents to $82.41.  Brent oil for October settlement increased $1.63, or 1.5
percent, to $108.62 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark settled at a record
premium to U.S. futures of $26.21 for the second day in a row,
based on settlement prices.  Enterprise fell $1.28, or 3.1 percent, to $39.45 today in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Energy Transfer fell
$1.26, or 2.9 percent, to $42.90.  Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE) ,
which controls Energy Transfer through ownership of its general
partner, fell $1.42, or 3.6 percent, to $37.70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
