Croatia â€™s main stock index fell the
most in almost two weeks as a decline in global markets amid
fears of a new worldwide recession led investors to avoid
emerging-market assets.  The Crobex benchmark index fell 1.8 percent to 1,955.08 at
11:47 a.m., the most since Aug. 8, led by T-Hrvatski Telekom
d.d., which fell 3.89 percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
