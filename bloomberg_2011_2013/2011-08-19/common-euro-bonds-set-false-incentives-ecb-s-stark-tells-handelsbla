European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said the introduction of common euro
bonds would create false incentives that would transform the
euro area into a transfer union, in an interview with  Germany ’s
Handelsblatt.  “Euro bonds are not only the entrance to a transfer union,
they are the transfer union,” Stark is cited as saying. “Euro
bonds are being portrayed as the silver bullet to emerge from
the crisis. But in actual fact it’s curing the symptoms and not
the cause.”  Euro-member states must rein in spending, Stark told the
newspaper. He also advocated a debt brake, enshrined in the
German constitution, as “indispensable” for other countries,
Handelsblatt said.  Stark said the duration of ECB’s bond purchase program
depends on how long market tensions prevail. He also said the
tensions in money markets are not comparable to the situation in
2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the
newspaper said.  Stark rejected the suggestion that lax monetary policy by
central banks is adding fuel to the fire, according to
Handelsblatt. “The ECB is the only major central bank that has
increased  interest rates  since the start of the year,” he is
cited as saying. “Keeping interest rates too low for too long
carries risks,” he added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
