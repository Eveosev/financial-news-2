The  U.S. economy  may expand less
than previously thought in the next two quarters as consumer
sentiment drops and the housing market fails to gain momentum,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a report.  Gross domestic product will grow 1 percent in the fourth
quarter rather than the 2.5 percent previously forecast and 0.5
percent in the first quarter of 2012 instead of 1.5 percent,
 Michael Feroli , JPMorgan’s chief U.S. economist in  New York ,
said in an e-mailed note to clients today.  Global stocks dropped today, European shares suffered their
biggest two-day slump since 2008 and oil sank below $80 a barrel
on concern the U.S. recovery is faltering and  Europe ’s debt
crisis will worsen. Morgan Stanley earlier this week cut its
forecast for global growth in 2011, and Citigroup Inc. lowered
estimates for the world’s largest economy in a note dated
yesterday.  “Growth in the current quarter looks only moderately
softer than our previous projection,” Feroli said in today’s
note. “Global growth has disappointed and foreign growth
forecasts have been taken lower. Risks of a recession are
clearly elevated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
