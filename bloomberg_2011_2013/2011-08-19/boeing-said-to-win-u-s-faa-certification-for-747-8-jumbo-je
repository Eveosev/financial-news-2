Boeing Co. (BA) ’s new 747-8 freighter won
certification from the U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  to
enter commercial  service , capping a two-year, $2.04 billion
delay for the company’s biggest plane ever.  Luxembourg’s Cargolux Airlines International SA will
receive the first of the jumbo jets early next month, Boeing
said today in a statement. The European Aviation Safety Agency
also gave its approval to the new plane, Boeing said.  Flight tests ran 18 months as Boeing worked through design
changes made to stretch the iconic hump and wings and add new
engines. When development began in 2005, first delivery was
targeted for 2009’s third quarter. Engineers were then diverted
to the even-later 787 Dreamliner, which set back work on the
jumbo jet and forced Boeing to log the additional costs.  Boeing expects FAA approval of the 787 next week, with a
ceremony set for Aug. 26, said a person familiar with the matter
who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. That plane, the world’s
first composite-plastic airliner, finished flight tests Aug. 13.  Trials continue on the 747-8 Intercontinental passenger
model as crews test different systems than on the freighter,
including climate control and airflow balancing, Todd Zarfos,
the chief engineer for the 747, said today on a conference call.  VIP, Lufthansa  The first VIP 747-8 Intercontinental will be delivered by
the end of this year, Zarfos said. The plane is due to begin
commercial service in early 2012 with  Deutsche Lufthansa AG. (LHA)   The Intercontinental’s testing is benefiting from the
freighter trials, as engineers resolved issues that included
flutter in the wings and buffeting around the wheel wells. The
functionality of the new flight-management computer on both
models had to be scaled back to avoid further delays, with a
software upgrade planned later.  Zarfos said the FAA should be able to catch up on airport
inspections stalled during the agency’s partial shutdown last
month, easing concern that the checks wouldn’t be done on time
to ensure that U.S. facilities could handle the new plane.  The jet’s wingspan is 224 feet (68 meters) and its fuselage
is 250 feet long, 18.3 feet more than the last model, the
747-400, which went out of production in 2009.  The Dreamliner is more than three years behind schedule
after Chicago-based Boeing struggled with the new materials and
a new production system it developed for the plane that relies
more on suppliers. The FAA is reviewing its certification
paperwork, and Boeing has said it expects to deliver the first
787 to  Japan ’s All Nippon Airways Co. next month.  Boeing plans to hand over 25 to 30 Dreamliners and 747-8
jets by December, with the split weighted toward the 747-8. The
first U.S. carrier scheduled to receive a new jumbo jet is  Atlas
Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. (AAWW) , which said Aug. 2 that it would get
the first of 12 freighters in the fourth quarter.  The 467-seat 747-8 Intercontinental competes with Airbus
SAS’s 525-seat A380, which entered service in 2007, while the
freighter has no commercial rival. Boeing has announced orders
for 114 of the freighters and 56 Intercontinentals, though 20 of
those haven’t been signed yet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
