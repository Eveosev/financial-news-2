Poland ’s central bank currently has
an informal ‘neutral’ policy stance and will “wait and see” as
it watches developments in the global economy before deciding
whether to raise or cut interest rates, policy maker Elzbieta Chojna-Duch said.  The rate-setting council should make a statement “to
stabilize” the situation after it meets on Aug. 23, she said
today on TVN CNBC. The council will hold its next rate-setting
meeting on Sept. 6-7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
