Taiwan ’s dollar weakened to a four-
month low after the government reported the slowest economic
expansion since 2009 and cut its growth forecast for this year.  Government bonds  rallied, driving five-year yields below 1
percent for the first time in 2011, after gross domestic product
rose 5.02 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter,
following a 6.16 percent increase in the previous three months.
This year’s growth estimate was lowered to 4.81 percent from
5.01 percent and a 4.58 percent expansion was forecast for 2012.
 China ,  South Korea ,  Hong Kong , Malaysia and Singapore have also
reported second-quarter growth that was the slowest since 2009.  “Bad global and Taiwan economic outlooks are good for bond
performances,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Since economic growth is slowing,
there might not be a need for the central bank to tighten any
more. That supports bonds as well.”  Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.3 percent to NT$29.076 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.135 earlier, the weakest
level since April 19. The currency slid 0.2 percent this week.  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016, the most-
traded securities, dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 0.974 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market
show. That’s the lowest rate for benchmark five-year debt since
December. It fell nine basis points this week.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, gained two basis points today and this
week to 0.403 percent, according to a weighted average compiled
by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
