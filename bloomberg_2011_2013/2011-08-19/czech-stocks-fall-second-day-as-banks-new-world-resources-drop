Czech shares fell for a second day,
erasing this week’s gains as  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG) ,  Komercni Banka
AS (KOMB)  and mining company New World Resources Plc dropped amid
concerns the U.S. recovery is faltering.  The PX gauge of 14 companies slid 1.7 percent to 988.4 at
its 4:28 p.m. close in Prague. The index, where Erste, Komercni
and NWR account for a combined 43 percent of the weighting, was
little changed this week and down 16 percent this month.  Investors bought gold, the yen and Swiss franc as Citigroup
Inc. cut its forecasts for U.S. growth and concern mounted that
 Europe ’s debt crisis will spread. Jobless claims in the world’s
largest economy rose and manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region unexpectedly contracted, data published yesterday showed.  “Disappointing Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
figures stirred up fears again that the world economy faces a
double-dip, unleashing a new wave of  risk aversion ,” analysts
at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt  wrote in a report today. “Emerging
markets in central and eastern Europe clearly suffered in the
rather unfriendly environment.”  U.S. stocks gained and European shares pared losses as the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rebounded from the lowest valuation
levels since 2009, offsetting concern that policy makers will
not be able to prevent an economic slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
