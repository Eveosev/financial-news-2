Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos
said he rejects a fiscal union among countries using the euro as
it would imply a “transfer union” and undermine the common
currency,  Handelsblatt  reported.  Germany ’s post-reunification example of subsidization of
the formerly Communist east by the richer western half of the
country shows that a transfer union can’t solve problems
quickly, Miklos said in an opinion piece published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
