U.S. Gulf oil premiums strengthened
after the discount of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to
Brent moved toward a record.  The gap between October contracts widened as much as $1.76
to $26.24 a barrel. The spread settled at a record margin
yesterday of $24.48 a barrel.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained 90 cents to $26.90 a barrel
over WTI at 2:02 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the widest gap since at least 1991.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 70 cents to
$23.45 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened $1 to $23 while Poseidon gained $1 to $22.75 a
barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased 50 cents to
$20.75 a barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to
75 cents. Thunder Horse’s premium lost 25 cents to $26.75 above
the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $15 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$13.40 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
