MetLife Inc. (MET)  signed an agreement to
put the biggest U.S. life insurerâ€™s name on the stadium that is
shared by the New York Giants and Jets, the New York Post
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The deal, which could be worth as much as $400 million over
20 years, may be announced as early as next week, the newspaper
said. The stadium will host the 2014  Super Bowl .  MetLife already is one of four so-called cornerstone
partners in the $1.6 billion stadium that opened last year in
East Rutherford, New Jersey, paying about $7 million for in-
stadium branding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
