A  Georgian court  sentenced Badri
Bitsadze, the husband of opposition leader  Nino Burjanadze , to
five and a half years in prison for organizing disobedience
against police.  Bitsadze, whose whereabouts remain unknown, received the
sentence in absentia, a Tbilisi City Court spokeswoman, Tamar
Andriadze, said by phone today. The authorities charged Bitsadze
in June with helping a group of anti-government protesters in
May attempt an armed uprising. He failed to make a 100,000-lari
($61,000) bail payment in June.  The charges of resisting police and using violence to
threaten public order are “ridiculous,” Bitsadze’s lawyer
Levan Samushia said by phone today.  Two people died in  Georgia ’s capital and at least 19 were
injured as police sought to remove anti-government protesters
from the city center in preparation for the independence day
parade on May 26. Opposition groups had held five days of
rallies in the city calling for the resignation of President
Mikheil Saakashvili.  Burjanadze’s driver was sentenced to a 12-year prison term
earlier this month after his car sped away from central Tbilisi,
killing a demonstrator and a police officer, Andriadze said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
