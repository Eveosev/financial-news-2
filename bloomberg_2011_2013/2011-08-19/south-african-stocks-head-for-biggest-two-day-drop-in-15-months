South Africa ’s stock gauge rebounded
from the lowest in a week as commodity prices rose on
speculation growth in  developing countries  will be strong enough
to boost raw-materials demand.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share index rose 0.3 percent by the
5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, after losing as much as 1.9
percent earlier. The index fell 1.5 percent this week. BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company, recovered
from a 4.4 percent loss to end 0.1 percent lower.  Anglo American
Plc (AGL) , which makes up 9 percent of the South African market, fell
1.9 percent, its weakest close in almost a year.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities added
1.1 percent after falling as much as 1.7 percent earlier today.
Commodities are little changed this year as the MSCI All-Country
World Index of equities tumbled 12 percent on concern the
sovereign-debt crisis is threatening global growth and demand
for raw materials. Consumption of oil shows no sign of a
recession, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  “You look at valuations and things look good value, but
unfortunately in these markets the valuation metrics go out the
window,” Craig Massey, head of stock broking at Sanlam Private
Investments, said by phone from  Cape Town . “We need to see some
positive surprises to stem the selling.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
