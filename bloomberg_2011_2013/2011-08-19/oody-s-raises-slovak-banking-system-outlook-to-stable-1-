The outlook on Slovakia’s banking
system was raised to “stable” from “negative” at Moody’s
Investors Service, which cited economic growth and rising
profitability of lenders among reasons for the change.  Moody’s said the export-driven economy will continue to be
supportive for the Slovak banks, which are mainly the units of
foreign lenders such as Vienna-based  Erste Group Bank AG. (EBS)   Although Slovakia’s dependence on western  Europe ’s recovery
represents a risk for the economy and banks, most of the lenders
have sufficient capital to absorb potential loan losses, Moody’s
said in a statement from Milan today.  Banks in the eastern euro-zone member grew after-tax profit
79 percent in the first six months from the same period last
year as the reviving economy fueled lending and cut the need for
loan-loss provisions, the central bank has said. The economy
grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier
period, almost double the pace for the whole euro-zone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
