U.S. stocks tumbled, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its biggest four-week loss since
March 2009, as concern the global economy is stalling
overshadowed the cheapest valuations in 2 1/2 years.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  plunged 27 percent this week, the most
since the October 1987 market crash, after a strategy shift
undermined confidence in its managers. Technology, industrial
and raw-material companies in the S&P 500 dropped at least 6.9
percent, the most among 10 groups.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Alcoa
Inc. (AA)  retreated more than 8.4 percent after some of the world’s
biggest banks -- Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Citigroup Inc. -- slashed economic growth forecasts.  The S&P 500 lost 4.7 percent to 1,123.53. It has sunk 16
percent since July 22 as about $3 trillion was erased from the
value of U.S. equities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 451.37 points, or 4
percent, to 10,817.65 this week, extending its four-week decline
to 1,863.51 points.  “We’re in a little bit of a tug of war,” David Joy, the
Boston-based chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial
Inc., said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $693
billion. “On the one hand, there’s the real concern about
what’s going on in  Europe , about the pressure on the banking
system and weakness in the global economy. On the other, an
opposing force seems to be an interest in buying at attractive
equity valuations.”  Cheapest Since 2009  The S&P 500 has fallen 18 percent from an almost three-year
high on April 29 amid concern about Europe’s government debt
crisis and a global economic slowdown. The decline through Aug.
8 drove the index to a valuation of 12.2 times reported
earnings, the lowest level since March 2009. Its price-earnings
ratio is now 12.3, compared with the average of 16.4 since 1954,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  This week’s loss included the S&P 500’s 4.5 percent retreat
on Aug. 18 amid speculation that European banks lack sufficient
capital. Lars Frisell, the chief economist at  Sweden ’s financial
regulator, said it won’t take much for interbank lending to
freeze. The market also declined after U.S. jobless claims rose,
Philadelphia-area manufacturing shrank by the most since 2009
and hopes for more stimulus from the  Federal Reserve  receded.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth plunged 10 percent this week, extending its loss
since July 22 to 26 percent and falling to the lowest level
since Aug. 26, 2010. Morgan Stanley economists cut forecasts for
global growth this year and said the U.S. and Europe are
“dangerously close to recession.”  JPMorgan, Citigroup  JPMorgan said the U.S. may expand less than previously
projected in the next two quarters as consumer sentiment drops
and the housing market fails to gain momentum. Citigroup also
cut estimates for the U.S.  “We separate the economic picture from the investment
picture,” Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens
Bancshares Inc., which manages $4 billion in Raleigh,  North
Carolina , said in a phone interview. “If the economy is
lackluster and stagnant, that does not imply that the stock
market has to continue to decline. With valuations where they
are, we find the market to be attractive. Companies are
generally in good shape, and earnings growth can continue to be
quite strong.”  Profit at  S&P 500  companies is forecast to rise 17 percent
to $99.05 a share in 2011 and 14 percent to $112.81 in 2012,
according to average analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Moving Together  Stocks in the S&P 500 are moving in lockstep with each
other by the most since at least 1990, a sign that the market’s
biggest retreat in three years may not be over, according to MF
Global Holdings Ltd. The average correlation coefficient between
the 500 companies and the index was 0.8268 on Aug. 18, using 60
days of data, according to MF Global.  High correlation “is usually the case in a  bear market ,
when investors are liquidating equities as an asset class,”
Craig Peskin, co-head of technical analysis at the  New York- 
based firm, wrote in an e-mail on Aug. 18. “In a bull market,
when investors are differentiating, we see low or falling
correlation.”  Correlation among S&P 500 stocks exceeded 0.78 twice
previously, according to MF Global. After the first time, on
Dec. 1, 2008, the S&P 500 declined 17 percent to a 12-year low
on March 9, 2009. Correlation peaked again on July 26, 2010,
when the benchmark slipped 6.1 percent over the next month, data
compiled by MF Global and Bloomberg show.  Buffett Buys  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. accelerated stock
purchases on Aug. 8 as the S&P 500 plunged the most since
December 2008, the billionaire investor said during an Aug. 15
interview with  Charlie Rose  on PBS.  “I like buying on sale,” said Buffett, Berkshire’s chief
executive officer. “Last Monday, we spent more money in the
stock market buying than any day this year.”  History shows the S&P 500 may keep sinking. The index
plunged 16 percent between July 25 and Aug. 8. The eight
declines of that size over similar amounts of time since 1928
led to additional losses averaging 17 percent, according to data
compiled by Bespoke Investment Group LLC, a Harrison, New York-
based research company.  Bearish wagers against global stocks at  hedge funds  have
surged to the highest level since July 2009 as the European debt
crisis and reports showing an economic slowdown cause the
biggest losses in almost three years.  Hedge Fund Survey  An index of hedge fund assets from International Strategy &
Investment Group dropped to 45.8 on Aug. 16, showing the most
short selling in two years, down from a 2011 high of 54.2 in
February. The research firm and broker-dealer surveys 35 hedge
funds with about $84 billion under management every week.  “The fear factor is so high after what happened in 2008
that people are overreacting,”  Eric Marshall , the director of
research at Hodges Capital Management Inc., said in a telephone
interview. Hodges has about $700 million in assets. “People are
assuming that we are somehow in store for another great
recession that would last several years, and I don’t see that.”  Hewlett-Packard tumbled 27 percent to $23.60.  Leo Apotheker 
cut sales forecasts for the third time since becoming chief
executive officer in November, citing tepid demand. He’s
spinning off the personal computer unit, dropping a five-month-
old plan to put the WebOS mobile software on devices and
purchasing Autonomy Corp. for $10.3 billion. While aimed at
helping add higher-margin products, the shifts are costly and
may be time consuming, said  Brian Marshall , an analyst at
Gleacher & Co.  Losing Confidence  “People just lost confidence in the company,” said
Marshall, who is based in San Francisco and has a “buy” rating
on the stock. “People are realizing the financial model is in
greater disarray than they previously thought.”  Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. surged 55 percent to
$37.86.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , the biggest maker of smartphone software,
agreed to buy it for $12.5 billion, gaining mobile patents and
expanding in the hardware business.  Larry Page , the Google co-founder who took over as chief
executive officer in April, is pushing the Web company into
smartphones to take on  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and gain more clout
for its Android software in the wireless business.  Google retreated 13 percent, the most since November 2008,
to $490.92. Apple fell 5.6 percent, the biggest weekly drop
since March, to $356.03.  To contact the reporters on this story:
