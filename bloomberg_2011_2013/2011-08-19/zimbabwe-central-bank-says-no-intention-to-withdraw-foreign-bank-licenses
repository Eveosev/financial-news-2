Zimbabwe ’s central bank Governor
Gideon Gono said the bank doesn’t have “any immediate or
foreseeable intention” of withdrawing the operating licenses of
registered banks in the country.  People should refrain from “tendencies toward firing
harmful verbal economic gunpowder” that may damage the
financial industry and harm the southern African nation’s
economy, Gono said in a statement on the Harare-based bank’s
website today.  Zimbabwe’s Herald newspaper reported Saviour Kasukuwere,
the minister of indigenization, had written to foreign banks and
other companies, including Barclays Plc and Standard Chartered
Plc, to give them two weeks to present proposals to meet a
target of selling 51 percent of their local units or risk losing
their licenses.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
