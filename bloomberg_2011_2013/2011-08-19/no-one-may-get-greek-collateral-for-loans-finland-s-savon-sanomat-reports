No country is likely to get
collateral for their loan guarantees to  Greece  and thus  Finland 
probably won’t participate in the Greek bailout, OP-Pohjola
Group Chief Executive Officer Reijo Karhinen told Savon Sanomat
newspaper.  “For the first time I’m concerned the euro system may
fail,” Karhinen, who heads Finland’s second-biggest banking and
insurance group, told the  Finnish newspaper . The EU “must come
up with decisions already this autumn” to solve the crisis, he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
