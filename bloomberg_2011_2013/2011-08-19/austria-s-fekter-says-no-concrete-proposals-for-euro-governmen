Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said there is no proposal on the table under which the
countries sharing the euro currency would change the European
Union treaty to relinquish competencies to a “euro
government.”  “We currently have no document being worked on under which
we would have a treaty change” that implies giving up sovereign
powers, Fekter told journalists in Vienna yesterday.  The proposals to change the treaty which are on the table
now include a “coordination” of economic policies, sanctions
for deficit countries, and new institutions like the European
Stability Mechanism, Fekter said. “This isn’t a euro
government,” she said.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy this week proposed establishing a “euro
council” as part of a planned “economic government” for
 Europe .  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-area
finance ministers, said in an interview today that the euro-area
governments must give up powers for a this plan to make sense.  To contact the reporters on this story:
