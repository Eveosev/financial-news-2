Poland ’s government is “leaning
toward” suspending its planned sale of shares in PKO Bank
Polski SA, the country’s largest lender, in light of recent
market conditions.  “If I were to decide now I would lean toward suspending
the sale,” Treasury Minister Aleksander Grad told reporters in
Warsaw today. The government, which faces a parliamentary
election Oct. 9, will make a decision Aug. 23, and may choose to
postpone its final ruling until mid-October, Grad said, adding
that he hopes Poland will sell PKO this year.  Even without the deal the government’s 2011 asset-sale
revenue target of 15 billion zloty ($5.2 billion) isn’t
threatened, Grad said. Poland has raised almost 12 billion zloty
from selling stakes in companies and Grad said the remaining
revenue will come from “medium-sized” deals.  Grad said he sees no need to increase revenue from
dividends from state-owned companies. The government aims to get
about 5 billion zloty this year, Grad said in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
