Barclays Capital, the investment
banking division of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , hired Pedro Grimaldi from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and two other equity analysts as it
seeks to expand its research of Latin American companies.  Grimaldi started covering Latin American pulp and paper
firms based in  Sao Paulo  this week, Mark Lane, a New York-based
spokesman for Barclays Capital, said in an e-mail statement
yesterday. Barclays also hired Gabriel Lima from Banco Santander
SA to cover Latin American food and beverages and Vera Rossi
from Morgan Stanley for telecommunications, he said, adding that
both analysts started their positions earlier this month.  “Equity research is an important element of the continued
expansion of our franchise in Brazil and the rest of  Latin
America , Roberto Attuch, Barclays Capital’s head of equity
research for Latin America, said in an e-mail statement today.
“These new appointments demonstrate the commitment we have to
providing our clients with quality research and insights.”  Barclays is initiating the coverage of the pulp and paper
and food and beverage industries in Latin America with these
additions, Lane said. Earlier this year, the bank started to
cover the aviation industry in the region after hiring Benjamin
Theurer from DWS Investments GmbH, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
