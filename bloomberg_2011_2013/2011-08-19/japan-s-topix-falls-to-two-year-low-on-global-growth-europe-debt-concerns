Japanese stocks fell for a third day,
sending the Topix index to its lowest closing level in more than
two years, on deepening concern the global economy is slowing
and Europe’s debt crisis will damage the banking system.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets more than 80 percent
of its revenue abroad, declined 3.3 percent after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. lowered its rating on Japanese automakers because of
slower U.S. economic growth.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest
camera maker, lost 2.4 percent.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) ,  Japan ’s No. 1
commodities trader, slid 3 percent after oil and metals prices
slipped.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 2.5 percent to 8,719.24
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index declined 2
percent to 751.69, the lowest close since March 2009. More than
five stocks retreated for each that rose. For the week, the
Nikkei has lost 2.7 percent while the Topix is down 2.2 percent.  “A sense of caution about slowdown in the global economy
is significantly increasing and the market is pricing in risk of
the slowdown in a rapid pace,” said  Junichi Misawa , head of
equity investment at Tokyo-based STB Asset Management Co. in
 Tokyo .  U.S. Rating Cut  Japanese stocks fell this month as  Standard & Poor’s  on Aug.
5 cut its sovereign rating on the U.S. by one level to AA+,
citing the failure of policy makers to meet the need to reduce
swelling debt in the world’s biggest economy.  “There’s a total lack of confidence in policy makers’
ability to defuse the situation,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-
based strategist for AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages
almost $100 billion. “Fear is breeding fear now.”  Declines in Japanese shares reduced the average price of
stocks in the Topix to 0.9 times book value. A level below 1
indicates a company’s assets are worth more than its market
value.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.9 percent
today. In  New York , the index tumbled 4.5 percent to 1,140.65
yesterday on concern the global economy is slowing and
speculation that European banks lack enough capital. The Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index plunged 4.8 percent in  London  yesterday, the
biggest drop since March 2009.  U.S. Employment  A report showed the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
general economic index plunged to minus 30.7 this month, the
lowest reading since March 2009, from 3.2 in July. The August
gauge exceeded the most pessimistic projection in a Bloomberg
News survey in which the median estimate was for a reading of 2.
Readings less than zero signal contraction in the area covering
eastern Pennsylvania, southern  New Jersey  and Delaware.  Government data also showed more Americans than forecast
filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last week, while
the cost of living climbed in July by the most in four months.
Separately, the National Association of Realtors said U.S. sales
of previously owned homes unexpectedly dropped in July,
reflecting an increase in contract cancellations due to strict
lending rules and low appraisals.  Slowing Economy  “Economic indicators showed the economy is slowing and
some people have even started to worry about a recession in the
U.S.,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at
Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Companies that rely on overseas sales declined. Honda
dropped 3.3 percent to 2,403 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s largest carmaker, declined 1.4 percent to 2,768 yen.
Canon lost 2.4 percent to 3,465 yen.  The  U.S. economy  may grow less than previously forecast in
2011 and 2012 due to potential “political paralysis” and
fiscal tightening steps, Citigroup Inc. wrote in a report.  The brokerage cut its 2011 gross domestic product growth
forecast to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent and lowered its 2012
GDP growth estimate to 2.1 percent from 2.7 percent, Steven Wieting and Shawn Snyder, analysts at Citigroup, wrote in a
report dated yesterday.  Carmakers Drop  Carmakers declined after Goldman Sachs cut its coverage
view on Japan’s auto sector to “neutral” from “attractive,”
citing slower U.S. growth and protracted yen strength. Nissan
Motor Co. slumped 4.4 percent to 653 yen.  Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202) 
tumbled 6.2 percent to 320 yen.  The yen appreciated to 76.45 against the dollar, compared
with 76.65 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency strengthened to 109.33 from
110.46. A stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters because it cuts
the value of overseas sales.  Mitsubishi lost 3 percent to 1,773 yen. Mitsui & Co.,
Japan’s second-largest trader, dropped 2.4 percent to 1,268 yen.
 Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s biggest energy exploration company, slid
4.7 percent to 475,000 yen.  Commodities declined on concern slower economic growth will
weaken demand for raw materials. Crude oil for September
delivery plunged 5.9 percent to settle at $82.38 a barrel in New
York yesterday. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for
six industrial metals including copper and aluminum retreated
2.4 percent.  Gree Inc. (3632) , an operator of a social-networking website,
tumbled 6.4 percent to 2,290 yen and was the most actively
traded stock by value in Japan. Goldman Sachs cut its investment
rating on the online company to “neutral” from “buy.”
Goldman also removed Gree from its “conviction buy list,”
citing recent rises in the stock price, according to a Japanese-
language report dated Aug. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
