The  U.S. economy  may expand less
than previously forecast in 2011 and 2012 because of potential
“political paralysis” and fiscal tightening steps, Citigroup
Inc. wrote in a report.  The brokerage cut its 2011 gross domestic product growth
forecast to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent and lowered its 2012
GDP growth estimate to 2.1 percent from 2.7 percent, Steven Wieting and Shawn Snyder, analysts at Citigroup, wrote in a
report dated yesterday. They also trimmed their estimates for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s earnings-per-share this year
to $97 from $98, and to $101 from $105 next year.  The positioning of the economy and pace of recovery so far
“do not suggest a new cyclical recession, rather an inability
to mount a full recovery,” they wrote. “We see corporate
profits growing at a quite low single-digit pace in coming years
even with the assumption of continued economic expansion.”  The  S&P 500  slumped 4.5 percent to 1,140.65 yesterday as a
Philadelphia-area manufacturing index sank to the lowest since
2009, jobless claims and consumer prices rose, and existing home
sales slid. The S&P 500 has tumbled 16 percent from its April 29
high, matching the retreat between April 23 and July 2, 2010,
previously the biggest contraction of the  bull market  that began
in March 2009.  Citigroup’s analysts said they are concerned about a
possible failure of parties to agree on reducing the deficit.  “Both tax increases and spending cuts larger than we
assume would be automatically triggered in the absence of
bipartisan agreement,” the analysts wrote. “In the absence of
action, very sharp tightening steps would occur in 2013 and
would be felt in financial market expectations through 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
