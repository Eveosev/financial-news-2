Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to the lowest level since November, on speculation
inflation will be within the central bank’s target and as the
expanding economy boosted appetite for the fixed-rate
securities.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.40 percent
at 2:04 p.m. New York time. That’s its lowest level on a closing
basis since Nov. 8. The bond’s price rose 0.517 centavo to
121.206 centavos per peso.  “Colombia’s fundamentals remain strong,” said Pedro Ospina, a bond analyst at Interbolsa SA, the nation’s biggest
brokerage. “For now there are no concerns regarding inflation,
the economy is growing and fiscal numbers are good. In that
sense, there is potential for further gains” in long-term
bonds, he said.  The gap between yields on fixed rate bonds due September
2014 and the benchmark securities due July 2024 narrowed to 120
basis points today from 152 basis points in February.  Colombia’s economy expanded 5.1 percent in the first
quarter from a year ago, and the government estimates it will
grow about 6 percent this year. Annual inflation was 3.42
percent in July, within the central bank’s 2 percent to 4
percent 2011 target.  The peso declined 0.3 percent to 1,782.9 per dollar from
1,777 yesterday. The currency posted a second straight weekly
gain, advancing 0.2 percent in the past five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
