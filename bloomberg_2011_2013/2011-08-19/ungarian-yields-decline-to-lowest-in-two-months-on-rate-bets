Hungarian  government bonds  rallied,
sending five-year yields to the lowest in two months, as
investors increased bets on a fall in borrowing costs.  The yield on the government bonds maturing in November
2017, the most actively traded in  Hungary  this week, dropped 13
basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.972 percent, the
lowest since June 15, as of 2:57 p.m. in Budapest.  “The market has started to price in a roughly 50 basis-
point decrease of the  base rate  in the next 12 months,”
analysts at Erste Group Bank AG including Zoltan Arokszallasi in
Budapest, wrote in a research report today.  One-year interest-rate swaps, derivatives used to hedge
against or speculate on future changes in funding costs, fell to
5.9175 percent on Aug. 17, the lowest since Nov. 22, from 6.3075
percent on Aug. 5. The swaps traded at 5.9625 percent today.  Policy makers may delay or forego a cut in  interest rates 
to protect the country’s currency amid a global fall in demand
for risk, analysts at  Societe Generale  SA, UniCredit SpA and
Erste said today. The forint has weakened 7.4 percent against
the Swiss franc so far this year.  “We are concerned about the volatility in risk assets and
the impact on the forint,” analysts at Societe Generale,
including Salomon Guillaume in  London , wrote in a research
report today. “Such volatility could delay the easing cycle.”  The forint strengthened 0.2 percent to 272.2 per euro,
after weakening as much as 0.9 percent earlier today.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank left borrowing costs at 6 percent
for a sixth month on July 26 as focus shifted from inflation to
the impact of  Europe ’s debt crisis on the economy. Policy makers
said they planned to leave borrowing costs unchanged for an
“extended period.”  The benchmark rate will be kept unchanged at the bank’s
next rate meeting on Aug. 23, according to all 19 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
