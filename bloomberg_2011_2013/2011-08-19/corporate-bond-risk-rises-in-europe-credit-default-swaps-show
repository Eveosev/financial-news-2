The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default jumped with contracts on financial
company debt rising to a record, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to
senior debt of 25 banks and insurers climbed 12 basis points to
245 basis points, the highest-ever level based on closing
prices, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 9 a.m. in  London .
The subordinated financial bond index was up 19 at 412.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 32 basis points to
676.5. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting bonds
against default and an increase signals deteriorating
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 6 basis points to 158 basis
points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
