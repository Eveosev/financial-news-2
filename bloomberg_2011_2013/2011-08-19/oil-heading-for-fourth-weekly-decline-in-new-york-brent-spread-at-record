Crude oil fell, capping a fourth
weekly decline, on concern that slower global economic growth
will reduce fuel demand. Brent oil traded at a record premium to
the U.S. contract.  Futures in New York have dropped 18 percent since July 22,
the biggest four-week decline since October 2008.  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  cut their U.S. growth forecasts as
officials struggle to stem Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. Oil
pared losses as the dollar weakened, making commodities more
attractive as an alternative investment.  “Sentiment has deteriorated significantly and swiftly over
the past week,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital
LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “We’re
on the cusp of a recessionary environment globally, which is
putting a damper on the demand outlook and being reflected in
the oil price.”  Crude oil for September delivery dropped 12 cents to $82.26
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Aug. 9. Prices fell 3.7 percent this week and
are down 10 percent this year. The more actively traded October
contract fell 10 cents to $82.41.  Brent oil for October settlement increased $1.63, or 1.5
percent, to $108.62 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. The European benchmark settled at a record
premium to U.S. futures of $26.21 for the second day in a row,
based on settlement prices.  Brent Premium  Brent’s premium has widened amid supply disruptions in the
 North Sea ,  Nigeria  and  Libya , in contrast to increasing
stockpiles in the U.S. Brent, a benchmark grade for Europe, the
Mediterranean and  Africa , last traded at a discount to New York
crude on Aug. 16, 2010.  The U.S. gross domestic product will grow 1 percent in the
fourth quarter rather than the 2.5 percent previously forecast
and 0.5 percent in the first quarter of 2012 instead of 1.5
percent, JPMorgan said in a note e-mailed to clients today.
Citigroup cut its 2011 growth forecast to 1.6 percent from 1.7
percent and lowered its projection for next year to 2.1 percent
from 2.7 percent, according to a note dated yesterday.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1 percent to
1,129.63 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 1 percent
to 10,877.32 at 2:30 p.m., when floor trading on the Nymex
closed. The  S&P 500  fell 16 percent from an almost three-year
high on April 29 through yesterday amid concern that Europe’s
debt crisis would hurt the global economy.  Crude oil’s decline yesterday, the third-biggest this year,
came after Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG cut their
forecasts for global economic expansion. Futures plunged 34
percent from a 2 1/2-year high of $114.83 on May 2 to $75.71 on
Aug. 9.  ‘Schizophrenic’ Market  “The crude oil market has been schizophrenic,” said David Kavanagh, president of Grant Park Fund in  Chicago , manager of a
$1 billion managed futures portfolio. “The market dropped from
about $115 to $75 in three months before climbing again.”  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose 1.1 percent to
642.29. Eighteen commodities increased. Gold for December
delivery climbed 1.7 percent to $1,852.20 an ounce on the Comex
in  New York , the fourth straight record settlement.  “Commodities are still in an uptrend while significant
technical damage has been done to the equity market,” Kavanagh
said. “Gold is the biggest  bull market  in the world now.”  The dollar fell 0.4 percent to $1.4387 against the euro
from $1.4333 yesterday. The Dollar Index, which tracks the
dollar against currencies including the yen, pound and Swedish
krona, slipped 0.3 percent to 73.996. A lower U.S. currency cuts
the appeal of dollar-denominated commodities as an investment.  New York oil may fall next week on concern that global
economic growth is slowing, a Bloomberg News survey showed.
Sixteen of 38 analysts, or 42 percent, forecast oil will decline
through Aug. 26. Eleven respondents, or 29 percent, predicted
prices will increase and 11 estimated there will be little
change during the period.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 700,316
contracts as of 3:53 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 918,723
contracts yesterday, 35 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.5 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
