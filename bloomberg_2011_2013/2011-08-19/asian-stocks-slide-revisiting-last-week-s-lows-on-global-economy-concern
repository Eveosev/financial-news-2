Asian stocks fell, with the regional
index revisiting levels from last week’s global stock rout, amid
signs the world economy is slowing and Europe’s debt crisis will
damage the banking system. South Korea’s Kospi Index was set to
drop the most since November 2009.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company, lost
2.9 percent in Sydney after oil and metal prices slumped.

half its sales from the Americas, tumbled 21 percent after
annual profit missed analyst estimates and U.S. jobless claims
and consumer prices advanced faster than projected.  Mitsubishi

of 11:23 a.m. in Tokyo, set to erase all its gains since the

week of loss. About 20 stocks dropped for each that advanced on
the index today. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  sank 4.4 percent, headed for
its biggest slump since Nov. 27, 2009.  “Everything that’s going on is just eating away at
investor confidence,” said Matt Riordan, who helps manage
almost $6.6 billion in Sydney at Paradice Investment Management
Pty. “Business confidence is tailing off and global growth
slowing, and Europe’s debt situation appears to be getting worse
and worse without any coordinated policy response. The worst
case is that you go back to a 2008-type financial crisis.”  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 2.2 percent and
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 2.6 percent.  Hong Kong ’s
Hang Seng Index dropped 2.6 percent.  Indonesia ,  Singapore  Cut  Indonesia’s Jakarta Composite Index plunged 2.5 percent

by year end to just 1 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index
decreased 2.5 percent after the brokerage cut its outlook to a 5
percent decrease from a 22 percent gain.  Stocks worldwide have plunged in the past four weeks as
concern the U.S. may enter a recession and as an intensifying
European debt crisis evoked memories of late 2008, when credit
markets froze after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 11 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 9.3 percent by the  S&P
500  and 18 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks in the

average, compared with 11.5 times for the S&P 500 and 9.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  ‘Lack of Confidence’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.9 percent
today. In  New York , the index tumbled 4.5 percent yesterday on
concern the global economy is slowing and speculation that
European banks lack enough capital. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
plunged 4.8 percent in  London  yesterday, the biggest drop since
March 2009.  “There’s a total lack of confidence in policymakers’
ability to defuse the situation,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-
based strategist for AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages
almost $100 billion. “Fear is breeding fear now.”  BHP Billiton lost 3.2 percent to A$37.97 in Sydney. Jiangxi

plunged to minus 30.7 this month, the lowest reading since March
2009.  The August gauge exceeded the most pessimistic projection
in a Bloomberg News survey in which the median estimate was for
a reading of 2. Government data also showed more Americans than
forecast filed applications for unemployment benefits last week,
while the cost of living climbed in July by the most in four
months.  Billabong tumbled 21 percent to A$4.08 in Sydney, a record
plunge, after the surf-wear maker scrapped an earnings forecast
while reporting full-year net income that missed all analyst
estimates.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) , Australia’s third-
biggest producer of  iron ore , dropped 4.6 percent to A$5.77
after full-year profit rose 76 percent, less than analysts
estimated.  Financial Shares  Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Co., a South Korean
shipbuilder that gets almost half its revenue overseas, plunged
11 percent to 18,900 won.  Financial stocks declined following losses in European bank
shares as the chief economist at Sweden’s financial regulator
said his country’s lenders must do more to prepare for a
worsening in Europe’s debt crisis that could freeze interbank
markets and cut off funding.  Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 2 percent to 351 yen in Tokyo. In

Erik Ogard, director of multi-strategy investments at Russell
Investments, which oversees $163.4 billion, said in an interview
with Susan Li on Bloomberg Television’s “First Up.” “There
are real economic things to be worried about, however it’s the
degree of the reaction that we think might just be a little
overdone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
