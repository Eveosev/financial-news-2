European stocks declined for a
second day, dragging the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index to the lowest in
two years, amid concern that the global economy is slowing.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s largest oil company, slid
2.4 percent as crude headed for a fourth weekly loss.  Volkswagen
AG (VOW)  dropped 2.6 percent as a gauge of auto shares slid to the
lowest since September.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender, fell 4.8 percent. Autonomy Corp. jumped
72 percent after the U.K.’s second-largest software company
agreed to be bought by Hewlett-Packard Co. for $10.3 billion.  The Stoxx 600 lost 1.6 percent to 223.13 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, the lowest since July 29, 2009. The gauge has
tumbled 23 percent from this year’s peak in February amid
concern that Europe will fail to contain its sovereign-debt
crisis and that the economic recovery in the U.S. will falter.  “People fear a recession” in the U.S.,  Andrea Williams ,
who helps manage $989 million as a  fund manager  at Royal  London 
Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television. “The second
fear is in Europe with the debt crisis: this political vacuum
and the feeling that they’re not doing enough. That’s affecting
banks. We’ve been defensively positioned.”  The Stoxx 600 has fallen 6.1 percent this week, a fourth
straight weekly decline, as economic reports indicated the
economy is weakening. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
general economic index fell more than forecast this month to the
lowest since March 2009, and U.S. initial jobless-benefit claims
climbed last week, according to reports yesterday. Data on Aug.
16 showed Germany grew at a slower-than-estimated pace in the
second quarter.  Euro Bonds  The Stoxx 600 pared an earlier loss of as much as 3.6
percent as the European Commission said it may present draft
legislation on joint bond sales by euro-area nations when
completing a report on the feasibility of common debt sales,
putting pressure on  Germany  to drop its opposition.  National benchmark indexes declined in all 18 western
European markets except Iceland.  France ’s CAC 40 lost 1.9
percent, U.K.’s FTSE 100 slid 1 percent and Germany’s DAX
dropped 2.2 percent.  The  U.S. economy  may expand less than previously forecast
in 2011 and 2012 because of potential “political paralysis”
and fiscal tightening steps, according to Citigroup Inc.  The brokerage cut its 2011 gross domestic product growth
forecast to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent and lowered its 2012
expansion estimate to 2.1 percent from 2.7 percent, Steven
Wieting and Shawn Snyder, analysts at Citigroup, wrote in a
report dated yesterday.  Growth Forecasts  JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its U.S. economic growth estimate
for the fourth quarter to 1 percent from 2.5 percent and reduced
its forecast for the first quarter of 2012 to 0.5 percent from
1.5 percent.  Bearish wagers against global stocks at hedge funds have
surged to the highest level since July 2009. An index of hedge
fund assets from International Strategy & Investment Group
dropped to 45.8 on Aug. 16, showing the most short selling in
two years, down from a 2011 high of 54.2 in February.  Investors should sell into any short-term rebound in stocks
after economic data this week increased the risk of a global
recession and a further selloff, according to Exane BNP Paribas.
Stocks may plunge a further 40 percent from current levels and
earnings per share may drop 35 percent peak-to-trough if the
global economy contracts, wrote Lars Kreckel in a report to
clients today.  Jackson Hole   The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the U.S. rose as much as
28 percent after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
foreshadowed a second round of so-called quantitative easing on
Aug. 27 of last year. He may announce policy intentions at a
conference in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming , on Aug. 26.  The Fed will extend its bond-purchasing plan,  Marc Faber ,
publisher of the Gloom, Boom & Doom report, said in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance.”  Shell retreated 2.4 percent to 1,883.5 pence, leading
energy stocks lower as oil earlier declined as much as 3.9
percent in  New York  to $79.17 a barrel.  BP Plc (BP/)  lost 2.5 percent
to 389.9 pence.  Preferred shares of Volkswagen, Europe’s largest automaker,
slipped 2.6 percent to 104.55 euros.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) 
lost 3.4 percent to 52.30 euros. A measure of automakers in the
Stoxx 600 fell 2.9 percent for the biggest decline in the index.  Lloyds helped lead bank stocks lower, falling 4.8 percent
to 28.38 pence, its lowest price since March 2009.  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK)  declined 2.7 percent to 27.21 euros.  Financial Debt  The cost of protecting European financial debt surged to an
all-time high today. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of
credit-default swaps linked to senior debt of 25 banks and
insurers increased as much as 12 basis points to 243, a record
based on closing prices, according to JPMorgan.  Autonomy soared 72 percent to 2,452 pence, the biggest jump
since at least 2000. Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest
computer maker, agreed to buy the company for $10.3 billion in
cash to increase sales of cloud services for businesses while
lessening its reliance on personal computers.  European software companies advanced, with the Stoxx 600
technology index rising 3 percent.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN) , the Geneva-
based maker of banking software, jumped 5.4 percent to 14.55
francs.  Software AG (SOW)  climbed 5.8 percent to 28.10 euros.  Royal Ahold NV, the Dutch owner of Stop & Shop supermarkets
in the U.S., slipped 3.3 percent to 8.04 euros. The stock was
cut to “neutral” from “buy” at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Danske Bank A/S slid 5.2 percent to 77.15 kroner as
 Denmark ’s biggest lender was cut to “equal weight” from
“overweight” at Morgan Stanley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
