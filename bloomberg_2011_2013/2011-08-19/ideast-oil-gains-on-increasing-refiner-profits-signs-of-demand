Middle East oil grades for sale to
 Asia  rose against their benchmark prices on signs of improving
processing profits for refiners and speculation that demand for
crude will outpace supply.  The premium of Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil
Co., over its benchmark widened by 10 cents to 33 cents a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Qatar
Marine’s premium climbed 16 cents to 23 cents a barrel,
Bloomberg data show.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude climbed 36
cents to $18.30 a barrel at 2:36 p.m. Singapore time, based on
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. Oil-demand growth
will outpace non-OPEC supply growth over the coming months and
going into 2012, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report dated
yesterday. Oil-supply growth from producers outside of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has slowed,
contributing to reduced inventories in Europe and Asia, Goldman
Sachs said.  Oman crude for immediate loading was unchanged at a premium
of 7 cents a barrel to its benchmark, Bloomberg data showed.
Upper Zakum Shaif crude flipped to a premium of 33 cents a
barrel over benchmark prices today from a discount of 15 cents
yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.  Oman futures for October delivery fell 79 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $101.76 a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at
6:56 p.m. Singapore time, with 1,449 contracts traded. The
settlement price was $101.65 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The October Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
fell 30 cents to $4.68 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates. The exchange for swaps for November dropped 32 cents
to $4.46.  To contact the reporter on this story:
