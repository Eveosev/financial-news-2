Sanjeev Jayant Kumar Shah, a former
financial adviser at  Smith Barney , was sentenced to 38 months in
prison for stealing $3.25 million from one client in a bid cover
up a failed trade he made for another.  Shah took the money from Belize Bank to cover heavy margin
calls after a calculation error on a set of complicated foreign-
exchange trades for Concorde Bank resulted in losses, according
to a sentencing memorandum. Shah’s lawyer, Ed Little, said he
panicked, seeking to avoid admitting his mistake to Concorde
Bank and to Smith Barney. Shah pleaded guilty in November.  U.S. District Judge William Pauley sentenced Shah to less
than the 78-to-97 months suggested by federal sentencing
guidelines, noting that Shah used $2 million of his own and his
family’s funds to meet the margin calls. Pauley also agreed with
Shah’s lawyer that he could easily have fled to  Kenya  where his
family lives to avoid prosecution.  “He made a very tragic mistake and then he compounded it,
time and time again, through any number of fraudulent acts, to
conceal that mistake,” Pauley said.  The case is U.S. v. Shah, 10-cr-1169, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
