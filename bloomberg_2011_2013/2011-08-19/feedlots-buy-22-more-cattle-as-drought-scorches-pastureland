U.S. feedlots increased purchases of
young cattle by 22 percent in July, as a lingering drought in
the southern U.S. forced ranchers to move animals off pastures.  Feedlots bought 2.153 million head of cattle last month, up
from 1.758 million in July 2010, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. The purchases were the most
for July since at least 1996, the USDA said. Thirteen analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 17 percent increase, on
average. The feedlot herd was 10.626 million as of Aug. 1, up
7.6 percent from a year earlier. Analysts expected a 7.1 percent
gain.  The drought in  Texas , the biggest cattle-producing state,
has spurred a record $5.2 billion in farm losses, Texas AgriLife
Extension Service, a unit of  Texas A&M University , said this
week. More than 49 percent of the land area in a six-state
 region  in the South is experiencing “exceptional” drought,
according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.  “Cattle placements during July were well above a year ago
due to the ongoing drought on the southern Plains, which is
forcing cattle off pastures into feedlots,” Troy Vetterkind,
the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in  Chicago , said in an
e-mail before the report. “This also increased the total on-
feed population slightly.”  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened on corn for about four to five months until they
weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.908 million animals to meatpackers
last month, up 0.4 percent from a year earlier and the second-
lowest since at least 1996, the USDA said. Analysts expected a
3.4 percent decrease, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
