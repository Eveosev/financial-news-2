Sandoz Inc., a unit of the Swiss
drug company  Novartis AG (NOVN) , filed a federal lawsuit in  Detroit 
seeking the court’s finding that its proposed generic version of
a Novo Nordisk A/S diabetes drug is non-infringing.  Sandoz plans to market a lower cost version of the Novo
Nordisk diabetes drug  Prandin , according to a complaint filed
yesterday. It has asked the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration 
for permission to do so.  The FDA application puts Sandoz “at considerable risk of
being sued,” according to the company’s complaint, because it
would bring the drug to market prior to the expiration of a Novo
Nordisk-claimed patented element.  In January, Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based Novo Nordisk lost a
U.S. court challenge to the patent in a lawsuit brought by
Detroit-based Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. It has
challenged that ruling on appeal.  Sandoz has cited that finding of invalidity in its
complaint.  “We are examining the suit,” Ken Inchausti, a Novo
Nordisk spokesman said by phone today. He declined to comment
further saying the company preferred to let the legal process
run its course.  The case is Sandoz Inc. v. Novo Nordisk Inc., 11cv13594,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of  Michigan  (Detroit).  To contact the reporter on this story:
