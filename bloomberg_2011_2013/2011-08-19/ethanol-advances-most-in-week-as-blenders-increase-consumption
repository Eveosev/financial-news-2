Ethanol futures advanced the most in
more than a week in  Chicago  as blenders use more of the fuel to
capture a tax credit.  Futures rose an eighth day out of 10 after an Energy
Department report this week showed inventories of the fuel at
17.6 million barrels, the lowest level since Jan. 7 and output
of conventional gasoline blended with the biofuel, a measure of
demand, at a record 5.31 million barrels a day. Refiners get a
45-cent tax credit for each gallon mixed into gasoline.  “Everything’s hunky dory,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst
at Linn Group in Chicago. “Blenders are still buying it and
still taking in inventories. You’re simply using more ethanol
than you’re making.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery climbed 5.5 cents,
or 2 percent, to $2.834 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures are up 19 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast climbed 1
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.995 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive rose 1.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.84, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  gained 1.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$2.925 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel added 0.5 cent
to $2.935.  Kitt said refiners may be using more of the fuel to capture
a tax credit that’s set to expire at the end of the year.
Lawmakers last month had worked on an agreement that would’ve
immediately repealed it.  They have some incentive to use it,’’ Kitt said.
“Especially when you look down the gun and six months from now
you don’t have a credit.”  Ethanol production in the U.S. fell 1 percent last week to
899,000 barrels a day, the Energy Department report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
