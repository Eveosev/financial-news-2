ERSA-Energias Renovaveis SA, a
Brazilian renewable energy company, will build four wind farms
with total capacity of 116 megawatts in the northern state of
 Rio Grande  do Norte.  The projects will go into operation in 2014 and sell
electricity on the countryâ€™s free market for power contracts,
the Sao Paulo-based company said today in a regulatory filing.
They will use turbines from Randers, Denmark-based Vestas Wind
Systems AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
