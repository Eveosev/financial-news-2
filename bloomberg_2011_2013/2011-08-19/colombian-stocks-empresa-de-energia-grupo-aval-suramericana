The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.8 percent to 12,948.56, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.5 percent to 1,573.10.  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB)  ,  Colombia ’s
second-biggest electricity distributor, fell 3.9 percent, the
most since November 2009, to 1,345 pesos. The company said it is
preparing documents for a debt management operation on up to
$133 million in overseas bonds that mature in 2014, according to
a regulatory filing late yesterday. Investors may be speculating
that the company is preparing a credit default swap, said Camilo Rubiano, an analyst at Afin SA.  Investors are also anticipating a dilution of shares after
shareholders approved on Aug. 10 plans to sell as much as 1
trillion pesos ($560.9 million) worth of shares, Rubiano said.  Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores (AVAL)   fell 3.4 percent to
1,135 pesos, the lowest level in almost a year.  “The financial sector has been most affected by news of
economic weakening in the U.S. and  Europe ,” said Samuel David Garcia, an analyst at Valores Bancolombia SA.  Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR)  , the
parent company of Colombia’s largest bank, may use bank loans to
pay for most of its $3.9 billion purchase of ING Groep NV assets
by December, Chief Executive Officer David Bojanini said. The
shares bucked a three-day decline and rose 1.3 percent to 33,900
pesos.  “The company’s plan to close its transaction in December
may have calmed the market,” said Garcia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
