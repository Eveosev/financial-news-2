John Williams , the president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of  San Francisco , said he’s “very
worried” about the risk of a worsening debt situation in Europe
and the “worst is not yet over,”  Handelsblatt  reported.  It’s difficult for troubled European countries to return to
normal economic performance when the business situation is weak
and too many countries save money at the same time, Williams
said in an interview with the German newspaper. That makes it
more difficult to fight budget deficits and debt and European
countries must find the “right balance” between austerity and
growth, Handelsblatt cited Williams as saying.  The  U.S. economy  is likely to grow 2.5 percent this year
and there’s currently no need for new monetary measures,
Williams told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
