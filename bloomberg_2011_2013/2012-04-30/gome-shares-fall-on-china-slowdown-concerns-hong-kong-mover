Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd. (493) , China’s second-biggest electronics retailer, fell to the
lowest level in almost three years in  Hong Kong  trading amid
slowing economic growth and concern that the end of government
subsidies will affect earnings.  Gome in a statement after the close of trading said it
expects a “significant decline” in profit for the three months
ended March 31 because of lower sales and a loss related to its
e-commerce business.  The stock dropped 5.4 percent to HK$1.40, at the close of
Hong Kong trading. The benchmark  Hang Seng  index rose 1.7
percent.  The Beijing-based company last month reported that 2011
profit fell 6 percent, missing analysts’ estimates as higher
costs weighed on the electronics retailer. Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in a note dated April 30 recommended that
investors sell Gome 2014 convertibles.  “Gome is suffering with the fading of various government
subsidies to encourage consumers to buy home appliances
following the last financial crisis,” the analysts wrote in the
research note.  A government program that gave shoppers as much as 400 yuan
to subsidize purchases of new home appliances helped drive
industry sales the past two years. The incentives, part of
 China ’s moves to boost domestic consumption, ended Dec. 31.  Gome competitor Suning Appliance Co. reported a 15 percent
drop in first-quarter net income last week. China, the world’s
second-largest economy, pared the nation’s economic growth
target to 7.5 percent from an 8 percent goal in place since
2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
