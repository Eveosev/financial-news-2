Woo Jin Yang, a Hitachi-LG Data
Storage Inc. sales manager for the companyâ€™s Hewlett-Packard
Inc. account, agreed to plead guilty and serve six months in
prison for conspiring to rig bids for optical disk drives.  The U.S.  Justice Department  said today that Yang worked
with others to eliminate competition for sales of the drives to
HP from 2006 to 2009 by meeting with co-conspirators to decide
prices and bidding strategies ahead of HP procurement events.
Optical disk drives use laser light or electromagnetic waves to
read data.  The conduct resulted in collusive and noncompetitive bids,
the agency said in an e-mail. Yang, also known as Eugene Yang,
was charged with four counts of bid-rigging, according to a
filing today in federal court in San Francisco. He agreed to pay
a $25,000 fine, according to the e-mailed statement.  Hitachi-LG is a joint venture of Tokyo-based  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) 
and Seoul-based  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  The company pleaded guilty
in November and was ordered to pay $21.1 million for bid rigging
and price fixing optical disk drives, the agency said.  The case is U.S. v. Yang, 12-00309, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
