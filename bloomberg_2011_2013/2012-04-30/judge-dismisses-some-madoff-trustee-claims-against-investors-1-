U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who
is reviewing hundreds of lawsuits filed by the liquidator of
 Bernard Madoff ’s firm, said he dismissed some claims against
investors including James Greiff.  In his ruling, Rakoff tossed claims by Madoff trustee
 Irving Picard  for taking back eight years of profit received
from the con man’s brokerage, leaving him to claw back two years
of profit. He made a similar decision this year when he cut
Picard’s $1 billion lawsuit against the  New York  Mets owners to
$386 million. Picard and the Major League Baseball team’s owners
later settled.  Rakoff said in the filing, dated April 27 and made public
today in federal court in Manhattan, that he would explain his
ruling today. The judge, who set an April 2 deadline for Madoff
investors to seek to move their cases to district court from
 bankruptcy court , received more than 400 new requests in the
week before the deadline expired.  Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Rakoff’s decision.  The Greiff case is Picard v. Greiff, 11-cv-03775, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story;
