Fresenius SE hired  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
for advice on the 3.1 billion euro ($4.1 billion) offer to buy
 Rhoen Klinikum AG (RHK) , said Matthias Link, a spokesman for
Fresenius, in an e-mail.  Fresenius announced the bid on April 26. Link and Joachim Weith, the company’s senior vice president for corporate
communications, said then that the  Bad Homburg , Germany-based
company didn’t use an investment bank. Rhoen Klinikum is being
advised by  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
