President  Richard Fisher  said monetary policy alone can’t create
enough jobs to sustain the economy and that more stimulus from
the Fed sends the wrong signals to fiscal policy makers.  “Monetary policy is one thing but it’s a very limited
tool,” Fisher said today in Los Angeles at a conference
sponsored by the Milken Institute. He also said the  central bank 
has disrupted pricing in the bond market in its program of
selling short-term securities for the purchase of long-term
debt.  The Fed’s program to extend the average duration of its
balance sheet, known as Operation Twist, is allowing the
government to borrow money at a lower cost, he said as part of a
panel discussion.  “By providing monetary accommodation, we’re saying, in
essence, Congress, you better eat your vegetables, or we’ll
serve you a big plate of monetary cookies,” said Fisher, who
doesn’t vote on  monetary policy  this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
