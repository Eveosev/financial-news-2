fighters to a base in the U.A.E. is “a harmful move” that
undermines the region’s security, the state-run  Fars  news agency

harmful and creating an insecure atmosphere in the region,” the
agency reported Vahidi as saying.  The U.S. has deployed F-22 Raptor aircraft to the Al Dhafra
air base,  Aviation Week  reported on April 26. The U.S. air force
said the aircraft had been sent to Southwest  Asia  to promote
regional security, the publication cited a spokesman as saying.  The U.A.E. base is south of the Strait of Hormuz, through
which about a fifth of globally traded oil passes, and Abu Musa
island, which is claimed by Iran and the U.A.E.  A visit to the island by Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  this month was provocative and violated U.A.E.
