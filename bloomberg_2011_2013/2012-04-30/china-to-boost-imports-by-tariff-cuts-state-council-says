China  plans to lower tariffs on
some products to encourage imports as the nation seeks to
alleviate pressures on domestic resources and reduce trade
conflicts, the State Council said in a statement today.  China’s cabinet called on local governments and departments
to stabilize and promote commodities imports, widen the buying
of advanced technology equipment and energy products, and
“appropriately enlarge” the import of consumer goods,
according to the  statement  posted on website.  The world’s second-largest economy reported an unexpected
 trade surplus  in March as import growth trailed forecasts. Gross
domestic product in the first quarter expanded 8.1 percent from
a year earlier, the least in almost three years. Premier  Wen Jiabao , who pared this year’s growth target to 7.5 percent, has
said economic policies will be fine-tuned as needed.  “Local administrations and government departments must
adjust their focus on encouraging exports and limiting imports
and place equal emphasis on both,” according to the statement.  China will reduce  import duties  on some energy products,
consumer goods and key components in strategic emerging
industries that cannot be produced locally, the State Council
said. The statement didn’t give details on how much tariffs will
be cut.  To encourage imports, the government will also provide
financing services and encourage commercial banks to offer
credit facilities, according to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
