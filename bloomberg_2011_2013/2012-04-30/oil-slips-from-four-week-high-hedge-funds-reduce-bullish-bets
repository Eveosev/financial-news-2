Oil traded near the highest level
in almost four weeks, heading for a monthly gain, as signs of
economic revival in the U.S. and  Asia  bolstered the outlook for
global crude demand.  Futures were little changed after gaining 1.8 percent last
week.  Consumer spending  probably rose in March as incomes grew
in the U.S., the world’s biggest oil user, economists said
before Commerce Department data today. Factory owners in  South
Korea  are the most upbeat in nine months and business confidence
is at an eight-month high in New Zealand, reports showed.  “We are still getting areas of demand and the market will
be optimistic toward that and really try and focus in on that,”
said  Jonathan Barratt , chief executive of Barratt’s Bulletin, a
commodity-markets newsletter in Sydney. “We’re looking for it
to move back though to $105 to $106 a barrel.”  Crude for June delivery was at $104.92 a barrel, down 1
cent, on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:16 p.m. Singapore
time. The contract advanced 0.4 percent to $104.93 on April 27,
the highest close since April 2. Prices are 1.8 percent higher
this month and up 6.2 percent this year.  Brent oil for June settlement was at $119.50 a barrel, down
33 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Prices are down 2.8 percent this month, heading for the first
monthly decline since December. The European benchmark
contract’s front month  premium  to West Texas Intermediate was at
$14.58, from $14.90 on April 27.  Technical Resistance  Oil’s advance in New York may stall near its 50-day moving
average, which is at $105.17 a barrel today. The price marks a
technical resistance level at which some traders sell.  Crude’s trading range in April has been the tightest for
any month in 17 years as concern eases that supplies will be
disrupted and reports show slower U.S. economic growth. This
month it has swung from $100.68 to $105.49 a barrel, a
difference of 4.8 percent. That’s the smallest since February
1995, when it traded from $18.13 to $18.98.  New York  futures rose to $110.55 a barrel on March 1 as
Western nations prepared sanctions against  Iran , then slipped as
tension eased. U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed to a
2.2 percent rate in the first quarter, according to the Commerce
Department.  Economic Outlook  Household purchases, which account for about 70 percent of
the  U.S. economy , rose 0.4 percent last month after a 0.8
percent gain in February that was the most in seven months,
according to the median estimate of 62 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The data may also show incomes grew 0.3 percent,
following a 0.2 percent gain.  An index measuring South Korean manufacturers’ expectations
for May was at 90, the strongest since August 2011, the  Bank of
Korea  said in a statement in  Seoul  today. A net 35.8 percent of
 New Zealand  companies expect the economy will improve over the
next 12 months, up from 33.8 percent in March and the highest
since July, according to an ANZ National Bank Ltd. survey
released in Wellington today.  Gasoline for May delivery was little changed at $3.206 a
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are heading
for a 5.4 percent decline for the month, the first since
November. The more actively traded June contract fell 0.2
percent to $3.1393 a gallon.  Gasoline Prices  Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on gasoline by the most in
four months, data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s Commitments of Traders report on April 27 showed.
Money managers reduced net-long positions by 6,383 futures and
options combined, or 7.3 percent, to 80,839 in the seven days
ended April 24. It was the biggest weekly drop since Dec. 20 and
the lowest level since the week ended Jan. 24.  Funds cut bullish crude-oil wagers by 2,878, or 1.4
percent, to 196,426 futures and options combined in the period.  Regular gasoline  at the  pump  fell for 11 consecutive days
to a nationwide average of $3.826 a gallon on April 26,
according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the largest U.S.
motoring club. Speculators have cut bullish bets by 16 percent
after reaching a record in the week ended March 6 on the lowest
demand for this time of year since 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
