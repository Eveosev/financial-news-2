Toyota Motor Corp. (TM)  sold $20 million
of structured notes in its first U.S. offering this year.  Toyota Motor Credit Corp., the finance unit of Asia’s
biggest automaker, issued $10 million in so-called step-up,
callable notes on April 18 and added another $10 million later,
according to a  prospectus  filed April 27 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Barclays Plc distributed the three-year
securities, which yield a set interest rate that increases, or
steps up, at predetermined dates, for a 0.22 percent fee.  Issuing structured notes lets Toyota “tap into a different
kind of demand and potentially different kinds of investors,”
Steve Howard, who runs the company’s capital markets and
derivatives programs in Torrance,  California , said last October
in a phone interview. The debt is often bought by individuals.  The carmaker sold $100 million of similar step-up notes
last year. Before credit markets seized up in the second half of
2008, Toyota issued structured notes tied to equities,
commodities and interest rates, with the securities making up as
much as 10 percent of overall funding, Howard said.  Structured notes are securities that combine bonds with
derivatives, which are contracts whose value is derived from
stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
