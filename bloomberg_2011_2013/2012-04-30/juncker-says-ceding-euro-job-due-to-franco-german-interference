Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-
Claude Juncker said he’s stepping down as head of the group of
euro-area finance ministers because he’s tired of Franco-German
interference in managing the region’s debt crisis.  “They act as if they are the only members of the group,”
Juncker said today at a podium discussion in Hamburg. At the
same time, Juncker said he’d “fully support” a potential
candidacy of German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  to
succeed him at the helm of the Eurogroup.  Schaeuble has “superb qualifications” for the job,
Juncker said. As a fundamental requirement, the job needs a
“personal capacity” to listen to others, he said.  A decision on replacing Juncker has been postponed until
after the second round of  France ’s presidential election.
Juncker has repeatedly stated that he won’t seek to remain in
the job. On March 2, he cited “time constraints” as his reason
for stepping aside.  Juncker said then that he and European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy  had been charged with putting together a
“personnel package” of nominations for the upcoming vacancy on
the European Central Bank’s Executive Board as well as the
leadership of the Eurogroup, the European Stability Mechanism
and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
