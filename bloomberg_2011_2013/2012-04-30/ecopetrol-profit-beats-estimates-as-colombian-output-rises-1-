Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s largest
oil company, said first-quarter profit rose 37 percent as an $80
billion investment plan this decade increased production and oil
prices advanced.  Profit climbed to 4.27 trillion pesos ($2.42 billion) from
3.11 trillion pesos a year earlier, the Bogota-based  company 
said today in an e-mailed statement. The result compared with
the average forecast of 4.10 trillion pesos by three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Oil was well over $100 a barrel and there have been
strong production increases,” said Valeria Marconi, an analyst
at Correval SA brokerage in Bogota.  Ecopetrol is scouting for oil in Colombia,  Brazil  and the
U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  as part of the investment effort to increase
output to 1.3 million barrels of oil a day in 2020. Production
rose to 743,400 barrels a day of equivalent oil and natural gas
in the quarter from 686,300 barrels a year earlier, the company
said in the report released after the close of regular trading.  Ecopetrol rose 2.2 percent to 5,700 pesos at the close in
Bogota. The shares have climbed 36 percent this year, outpacing
a 14 percent gain in Colombia’s benchmark  COLCAP (COLCAP)  stock index.  Rebel Attacks  Rebel attacks on pipelines increased in the first quarter
in Colombia, slowing gains in Ecopetrol’s production, said
Mauricio Restrepo, an analyst at brokerage Bolsa y Renta in
Medellin, Colombia. Sabotage of energy towers, pipelines, roads
and bridges rose last year for the first time since 2008,
according to government statistics.  “Security has again become a challenge,” Restrepo said.
“ Oil companies  are visible targets.”  Production was little changed from the fourth quarter, when
output was 741,700 barrels a day. Chief Executive Officer Javier Gutierrez said in March that guerrilla attacks won’t derail
plans to increase the company’s production this year to 800,000
barrels of oil and natural gas a day.  The government is making additional investments to
guarantee security, Mines and Energy Minister  Mauricio Cardenas 
told oil executives in March in Cartagena, Colombia. In
February, oil output from all companies producing in Colombia
fell 4.8 percent to 896,000 barrels a day after pipeline
sabotage.  The nation is the largest oil supplier in  South America 
after Venezuela and Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
