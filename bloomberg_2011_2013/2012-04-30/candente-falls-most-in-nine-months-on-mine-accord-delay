Candente Copper Corp. (DNT) , a Canadian
mining exploration company with operations in  Peru , fell the
most in nine months on speculation its Canariaco copper project
faces delays over land rights.  Vancouver-based Candente dropped 9 percent to 81 cents at
12:33 p.m. in Lima. It earlier slumped as much as 12 percent,
the steepest intraday drop since Aug. 8.  A judge will call a general assembly in the southern Andean
community of Kanaris to vote on a three-year “surface access
rights agreement” for Canariaco after leader Cristobal Barrios
proposed a referendum, Candente said today in an e-mailed
statement. Community members are taking legal action to prevent
a referendum, the company said.  “The market began selling as there isn’t a good
relationship with the community,” said Jorge Rodriguez, an
analyst at Kallpa Securities SAB in  Lima . “It’s a political
problem where the community leader opposes the project.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
