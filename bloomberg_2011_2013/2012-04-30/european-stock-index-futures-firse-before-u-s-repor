European stocks  fell for the first
time in five days, extending the biggest monthly drop since
September, as Spain entered a recession and U.S. business
activity expanded at the slowest pace since November 2009.  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  paced declining shares after the
world’s largest brewer reported revenue that fell short of
analyst estimates.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  slid 3.4 percent as
Credit Suisse Group AG recommended investors sell the shares.
 Adidas AG (ADS)  surged to a record after the sporting-goods maker
raised its 2012 earnings forecast.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  fell 0.7 percent to 257.28 at
the close of trading. The benchmark gauge has retreated 2.3
percent in April, a second straight month of losses, amid worse-
than-forecast economic data and political uncertainty in France
and the Netherlands. The measure has still advanced 5.2 percent
in 2012.  “There is a two-way pull in the market at the moment,”
said Kevin Lilley, a European  fund manager  at Old Mutual Asset
Managers U.K. in London, which has 4 billion pounds ($6.5
billion) in assets under management. “On the one hand, company
results coming through are generally better than expected on
both sides of the Atlantic, and on the other hand, economic data
has been mixed.”  Spain ’s economy officially entered its second recession
since 2009 as gross domestic product contracted 0.3 percent in
the first quarter, less than previous forecast. That compared
with the Bank of Spain’s estimate on April 23 of a 0.4 percent
decline. From a year ago, GDP fell 0.4 percent, INE said.  Business Sentiment  In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago
Inc. said its business barometer dropped to 56.2 in April from
62.2 a month earlier, lower than the most pessimistic forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Economists projected the gauge would fall to 60, according
to the median of 55 estimates in the survey. Readings greater
than 50 signal growth.  Another U.S. report showed  consumer spending  climbed in
March and incomes picked up, indicating the biggest part of the
world’s largest economy will help sustain the expansion.  National benchmark indexes fell in 11 of the 18 western
European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 lost 1.6 percent, the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 slid 0.7 percent and  Germany ’s DAX retreated 0.6
percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
Stoxx 600 was 27 percent lower than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most western
European markets, including Germany, France and Spain, are
closed for the May Day holiday tomorrow.  AB InBev Drops  AB InBev lost 1.2 percent to 54.45 euros. The world’s
biggest brewer reported a 6.2 percent gain in first-quarter
revenue, excluding acquisitions, disposals and currency
fluctuations. The median estimate of eight analysts was for a
6.6 percent increase.  Vestas dropped 3.4 percent to 49.61 kroner in Copenhagen as
Credit Suisse reiterated its underperform recommendation, the
equivalent of a sell rating, citing slower growth in services
and spare parts, increased losses on new products and “limited
balance sheet flexibility.”  “We would short sell Vestas on a three-month view,”
analysts wrote in a report to clients dated today. “We think
there’s further negatives that the market doesn’t fully
fathom.” The bank also cut its share-price estimate for the
world’s largest wind-turbine maker by 20 percent to 40 kroner.  Aquarius Platinum  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  sank 10 percent to 130 pence, the
biggest decline since September, as the fourth-largest platinum
producer reported a 7 percent drop in attributable output for
the third quarter. The company also suspended the Siphumelele
shaft and the M5 project at its Marikana operations in  South
Africa  because of low local-currency prices for its metals.  Adidas limited losses in the Stoxx 600, climbing 5.3
percent to 63 euros, the highest since its 1995 initial public
offering. The company forecast a 12 percent to 17 percent
increase in full-year profit, higher than a previous prediction
of 10 percent to 15 percent growth.  The world’s second-largest sporting-goods maker also
reported a 38 percent jump in net income to 289 million euros
($383 million) in the first three months of the year fueled by
golf sales and growth in  China . That beat the 230.6 million-euro
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Actelion, Telenor  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  soared 14 percent to 38.40 Swiss francs as
its experimental lung drug macitentan met the main goal of a
late-stage clinical trial, providing the company with a possible
successor to a treatment that accounts for 89 percent of sales.  Telenor ASA (TEL)  rallied 5.2 percent to 105.20 kroner as the
company said it may have to exit  India , the world’s second-
largest mobile market, after the country’s telecommunications
regulator proposed an 11-fold increase in license fees.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  climbed 3.5 percent to 283.5
pence after the company reported a 14 percent increase in
adjusted earnings before amortization for the six months ended
March 31 to 162.2 million pounds. That topped the average
analyst estimate of 151.7 million pounds in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
