The death toll in an explosion in
 Nigeria ’s Taraba state capital today has risen to 11, Umar
Waziri, a Nigeria Red Cross coordinator in the state, told
reporters today.  The bomber ran into a convoy of the state police
commissioner in Jalingo and three people, including the bomber,
were killed instantly, said Ibiang Mbaseki, a spokesman for the
state’s police.  No group immediately claimed responsibility for the
attack.  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a
sin,” has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks and
bombings in the mainly Muslim north and Abuja that have claimed
the lives of hundreds of people since 2009 in  Africa ’s top oil
producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
