Srbijagas,  Serbia ’s natural-gas
monopoly, posted a 42 percent increase in profit for last year
and urged the government to help cut debt owed by other state-
run companies.  Net income rose to 1.25 billion dinars ($14.8 million) last
year from 881 million dinars in 2010 as earnings from its Novi
Sad-based company’s chemical production and glass-making
businesses helped offset losses on sales of gas imported from
 Russia , General Manager Dusan Bajatovic told reporters today.  The company, which sold gas 20 percent to 28 percent below
the price it paid to Russia’s OAO Gazprom, will continue posting
losses on distributing the fuel as long as the government keeps
capping prices at which the Serbian utility is allowed to sell
gas to domestic clients, Bajatovic said.  The regulated price keeps gas in Serbia “the cheapest in
 Europe  after  Romania ,” he said, and has cost the company some
200 million euros ($265 million) since 2008.  Srbijagas has “certain proposals for the government” to
help it reduce debt. Liabilities from companies rose 29 percent
to 78.4 billion dinars and “at least 20 percent of that will
never be paid,” Bajatovic said.  Public Debt  “I’m afraid a considerable part of these liabilities will
eventually have to become part of Serbia’s public debt,” he
said, adding Srbijagas owes more than 60 billion dinars to
banks, of which about two-thirds are “long-term loans.”  Sales rose 3.1 percent to 2.3 billion cubic meters of gas,
and the number of clients increased 2.6 percent to more than
76,000 last year.  Srbijagas’s investments in distribution network and gas
depots are seen at 224.5 million euros over the next two years,
Bajatovic said.  The company is also part of the Gazprom’s South Stream
pipeline project, whose 415-kilometers (260 mile) stretch
through Serbia may cost 1.65 billion euros to build, Bajatovic
said. In October, he estimated the cost at 1.38 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
