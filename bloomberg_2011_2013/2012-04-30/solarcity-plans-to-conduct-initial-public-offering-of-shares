SolarCity Corp., the developer of
rooftop solar power systems whose chairman heads  Tesla Motors
Inc. (TSLA) , is planning an initial public offering.  The offering will begin after the Securities & Exchange
Commission reviews a draft registration statement the San Mateo,
California-based company submitted April 26, according to a
statement today that didn’t say how many shares it plans to sell
or at what price.  SolarCity is seeking to go public while other renewable-
energy companies are abandoning their IPO plans.  BrightSource
Energy Inc. (BRSE) , a developer of solar-thermal power plants, and the
cellulosic ethanol producer Enerkem Inc. both withdrew their
registrations this month.  SolarCity’s Chairman Elon Musk is also chairman and chief
executive officer of electric vehicle maker Tesla, which went
public in 2010.  SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Lyndon Rive,
chief executive officer, and Peter Rive, chief operations and
technology officer. They are Musk’s cousins.  The company’s projects have been financed with partners
including  Google Inc. (GOOG) , U.S. Bancorp and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  Its
backers include Mayfield Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management LLP.  Jonathan Bass, a SolarCity spokesman, wouldn’t provide any
additional information on the planned IPO in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
