Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the
largest owner of Syncrude Canada Ltd., cut its 2012 synthetic
oil production estimate to 301,000 barrels a day because of a
 maintenance turnaround  in the second quarter.  Canadian Oil Sands reduced the single-point 2012 production
estimate by 2.7 percent, or 3 million barrels, to 110 million
barrels, the Calgary-based company said in a statement.  “The 110 million-barrel Syncrude production outlook
incorporates actual first-quarter 2012 production, a planned
turnaround of Coker 8-3 during the second quarter of the year,
and an allowance for unplanned outages,” Canadian Oil said.  Syncrude production in the first quarter was 295,000
barrels per day, down from 321,000 a year earlier, after the
company took Coker 8-1 offline for repairs. The unit returned to
 service  this month, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
