Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said he expects more bank mergers and efforts to clean
up balance sheets, reiterating the nation won’t seek a European
bailout for its lenders.  “In the coming days, I think we will see additional
operations in terms of mergers and acquisitions and the
consolidation process in the banking sector and additional
efforts by the banks to restructure and clean up,” he told
reporters today after meeting with German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble in Santiago de Compostela,  Spain .  Less than three months after tightening rules to force
lenders to recognize deeper real-estate losses, Spain is seeking
new ways to convince the  bond market  that bank losses won’t
overburden  public  finances. The economy is back in a recession,
data showed today, as the jobless rate nears 25 percent, piling
additional pressure on banks suffering from the collapse of the
real-estate boom.  Guindos said allowing lenders to separate off real estate
assets for which they have already made provisions “makes
sense” and is “positive” for banks as it would free up
capital and allow them to concentrate on business. Speaking at a
news conference, he gave no more details about the plan, which
officials first announced a week ago.  Spain is in the midst of its third effort to clean up the
banking industry since the bubble burst in 2008. In February,
the government increased the ratio of provisions to be set aside
for land to 80 percent, while raising the ratio on unfinished
developments to 65 percent and to 35 percent for other troubled
assets including finished houses. The new provisioning rules
cover about 180 billion euros ($238 billion) of assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
