What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade after unexpected cash deliveries
against the expiring May contract signaled last weekâ€™s rally to
the highest price since July 2008 may be slowing demand, said
Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open 0.25 cent to 0.35 cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal
futures may open down $1 to up $1 per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after weekend rain boosted soil moisture for
maturing winter crops from  Texas  to Ohio, Grow said in a
telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago as global demand from makers of livestock feed
rises amid tightening supplies, Grow said. Contracts for
delivery after the harvest may fall as forecasts for rain and
warmer temperatures this week boost development of recently
planted crops, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
