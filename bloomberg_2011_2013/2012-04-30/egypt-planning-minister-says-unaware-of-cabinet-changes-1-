Egypt ’s planning and international
cooperation minister said she was unaware of plans to reshuffle
the Cabinet, contradicting earlier remarks by the parliamentary
speaker that the change would be announced by the ruling
military council.  “As far as I know, there is not going to be a ministerial
change,” Fayza Aboulnaga told reporters today. She said she
couldn’t comment on remarks by Parliament Speaker Saad el-
Katatni yesterday that he’d been told by the ruling generals
that a change would be announced within 48 hours. One day has
passed, so “why don’t we wait another 24 hours,” she said.  An about-face in the announced change could add further
confusion to the country’s tumultuous political scene on the day
that campaigning began for Egypt’s first presidential election
since  Hosni Mubarak ’s ouster last year.  The election, slated to begin May 23, takes place as the
ruling military council comes under growing pressure from
Islamists and secularists concerned it will renege on pledges to
hand over power to a civilian administration.  El-Katatni yesterday said he had received a promise that
the military would make changes within the government. That step
came after the assembly voted to suspend its work for the
remainder of the week to protest the ruling generals’ refusal to
fire a government lawmakers see as obstructing their work and
“engineering” crises.  To contact the reporter on this story:
