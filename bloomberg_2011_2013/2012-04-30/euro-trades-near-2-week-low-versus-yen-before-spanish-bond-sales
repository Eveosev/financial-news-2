The dollar rose from a four-week low
against the euro after a gauge of U.S. manufacturing
unexpectedly advanced in April, easing concern the economic
recovery is flagging and damping bets the  Federal Reserve  will
introduce more stimulus.  The greenback climbed against the yen as the data
highlighted a divergence between U.S. economic performance and
that of Europe, where reports over the past week showed the U.K.
and Spain have fallen into recession.  Australia ’s dollar slid
against all of its major peers after the nation’s central bank
cut  interest rates  more than forecast. The pound fell after U.K.
factory growth slowed.  U.S. “manufacturing had been pointing to one of the
stronger parts of the economy in the recovery, and it’s a good
sign that we’re getting another decent number,” said Brian Kim,
a currency strategist in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. “It’s something that keeps us constructive
on this whole North America-European divide. This is showing
that there is some distinction among the growth areas.”  The U.S. currency gained 0.1 percent versus the euro to
$1.3224 at 11:22 a.m. New York time after falling earlier to
$1.3284, the weakest level since April 3. It strengthened 0.5
percent against the yen to 80.19.  Europe ’s 17-nation currency
appreciated 0.4 percent to 106.04 yen.  Factory Index  The Institute for Supply Management’s  factory index  rose to
54.8 in April from 53.4 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s report showed today. Economists in a Bloomberg
survey forecast a decline to 53. Readings greater than 50 signal
growth.  The dollar reversed an earlier drop to 79.64 yen, the
lowest level since Feb. 21, as the data reduced bets the Fed
will take more action to promote economic growth.  While the central bank refrained at a two-day meeting last
week from new actions to boost the economy, Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said it’s “prepared to do more” if necessary. The Fed
bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of quantitative
easing from December 2008 to June 2011 to stimulate the economy
through lower borrowing costs.  Mexico ’s peso rose the most among the dollar’s 16 most-
active counterparts tracked by Bloomberg, and  Canada ’s dollar
also advanced after the ISM data. The U.S. is the biggest
trading partner of both nations.  The peso strengthened 0.9 percent to 12.8946 per dollar,
and the Canadian currency advanced 0.3 percent to 98.39 cents to
the greenback.  European Manufacturing  Manufacturing in the euro region shrank in April, according
to a Markit Economics report last week. The London-based firm
said a composite index for the area based on a survey of
manufacturing and services purchasing managers dropped to 47.4
in April from 49.1 in March. A purchasing-manager index of
German manufacturing fell to 46.3 for April, from 48.4 in March.  Sterling weakened versus the dollar after a report based on
a survey by  Markit Economics  and the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply showed U.K. factory output fell to 50.5
last month from a revised 51.9 in March. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News predicted 51.5. The survey followed data last
week showing Britain’s economy re-entered a recession last
quarter.  The pound declined 0.1 percent to $1.6219. It was little
changed at 81.53 pence per euro after falling as much as 0.5
percent. Sterling appreciated yesterday to 81.23 pence, the
strongest since June 2010.  ‘Long Way’  “The PMI data clearly weighed on sterling,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in
 London . “There’s some clear profit-taking in sterling, as it’s
come a long way against both the euro and dollar. The numbers
leave scope for economists to question the depth of last week’s
GDP data.”  A report yesterday showed  Spain ’s gross domestic product
fell 0.3 percent in the first quarter, the same as in the
previous three months, marking the nation’s second recession
since 2009.  The  U.S. economy  grew by 2.2 percent in the first three
months of the year, a report showed last week.  The Aussie dollar dropped for a second day against the
greenback after the  Reserve Bank  of Australia lowered its
overnight cash rate target to 3.75 percent from 4.25 percent,
the deepest cut in three years. Two of 29 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News predicted the move, while the other 27 forecast a
quarter-percentage-point reduction to 4 percent.  The Australian currency slid 0.8 percent to $1.0346 and
touched $1.0305, the lowest level since April 24. It depreciated
0.3 percent to 82.96 yen and touched 82.11 yen, the weakest
since Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
