Syncrude strengthened to a premium
versus West Texas Intermediate for the first time in almost four
months after a Canadian producer trimmed its annual production
forecast.  Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the largest owner of the Syncrude
Canada Ltd. joint venture, cut its 2012 Syncrude production
estimate to 110 million barrels. The revised projection includes
a maintenance turnaround on the Coker 8-3 in the second quarter
of the year, actual first-quarter production and “an allowance
for unplanned outages,” the company said.  Syncrude strengthened $2.75 a barrel to a $1.50 premium
over WTI at 4:01 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the grade’s highest premium since Dec. 30.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed $1 to
$14.85. Bakken oil’s discount widened 25 cents to $6.75.  U.S. Gulf Coast crudes weakened as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut
its 22-inch North Line pipeline in  Louisiana  after a spill of
about 1,900 barrels of oil. The pipeline carries crude from the
Louisiana coast to refineries with a combined capacity of more
than 700,000 barrels a day, according to Exxon’s website.  Mars Blend’s premium to West Texas Intermediate narrowed 10
cents to $10.50 a barrel. Poseidon’s premium weakened 40 cents
to $9.60, while Southern Green Canyon’s was steady at $9.50. The
three grades are used in the Argus Sour Crude Index.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
the other three grades, added 70 cents against WTI to a premium
of $14.20.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI was unchanged at
$16.50 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium decreased 60
cents to $16.15 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
