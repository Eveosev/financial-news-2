The Spanish soccer league denied a
report by the Cadena Ser radio station that it had asked for an
investigation into possible match-fixing in the current
championship.  The league said in an  e-mailed statement  it met officials
from a unit of the Justice Ministry responsible for
investigating fraud a few weeks ago, although “at present” had
not made any formal accusation.  Cadena Ser  said on its website that several games are under
suspicion and will give more details tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
