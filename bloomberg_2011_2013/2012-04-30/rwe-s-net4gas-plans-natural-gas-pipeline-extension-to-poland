RWE AG (RWE) ’s Net4Gas unit, the operator
of natural-gas pipelines in the  Czech Republic , plans an
extension to hook up with  Poland ’s distribution network.  Part of the cost will be subsidized by the European Union,
Milan Repka, a spokesman for Net4Gas, said today by phone. He
didn’t give a value for the project.  Net4Gas is pressing ahead with the proposal even after RWE
announced its intention to offer company for sale last year as
part of its asset-reduction program.  “The plan for interconnecting Czech and Polish gas
pipelines is valid regardless of RWE’s plans to sell Net4Gas,”
Repka said. “The EU will finance only a part of the project.”  The pipeline operator will first gauge potential interest
among gas traders and determine the economic feasibility of the
project, Repka said. That will probably happen in 2015, a year
before the actual construction begins, he said.  The project will require investment of 1 billion koruna
($53 million), E15 newspaper reported on its website, without
saying where it got the information from.  To contact the reporter on this story:
