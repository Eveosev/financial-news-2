Economists covering Brazil
increased their 2012 and 2013  inflation forecasts  after two
price indexes published last week rose more than expected.  Consumer prices will increase 5.12 percent this year, up
from the previous estimate of 5.08 percent, according to a
weekly central bank survey of about 100 economists published
today. The economists raised their forecast for 2013 inflation
to 5.53 percent, from 5.5 percent the previous week.  Analysts expect central bank President Alexandre Tombini to
hold the benchmark Selic rate at 9 percent this year, the survey
found, even after the bank signaled last week that it may
continue to cut borrowing costs. Policy makers will raise the
Selic to 10 percent next year, the survey found.  In the minutes to its April policy meeting, published last
week, the central bank said that future interest rate cuts will
be “conducted with parsimony.” Tombini has cut borrowing costs
by 3.5 percentage points to 9 percent since August, more than
any other central banker in the Group of 20 Nations.  Economists raised their estimate for economic growth this
year to 3.22 percent, from 3.21 percent.  Brazil ’s economy will
grow 4.3 percent next year, according to the survey, from a
previous estimate of 4.25 percent.  Consumer prices  climbed 0.43 percent in the month through
mid-April, from 0.25 percent a month earlier, taking the annual
rate to 5.25 percent. The monthly increase was higher than all
but two economist forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of 42
analysts. The IGP-M index, Brazil’s broadest measure of
inflation, rose the most in 14 months in April. Brazil targets
annual consumer-price rises of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
