Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  will have to
increase spending on a proposed $4.8 billion Peruvian gold mine
if it wants to advance the stalled project.  Newmont and partner  Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SAA  expect
to reach “an additional agreement” with the government on
Minas Conga, Buenaventura Chief Executive Officer Roque Benavides said on a conference call with analysts today. A
review commissioned by the government recommended expanding the
site’s reservoir capacity.  “It will be a higher capital expenditure, but it won’t be
a substantial amount compared to the overall cost of the
project,” Benavides said. “The company is essentially
evaluating and doing our best to offer additional
alternatives.” Lima-based Buenaventura holds a 49 percent stake
in the project.  Peru suspended the project and commissioned an
environmental review after Andean farmers, concerned that the
project would dry up water supplies, blocked roads and destroyed
Newmont’s installations in November.  Newmont has “other options” if the report’s
recommendations make Conga too expensive to build, Richard O’Brien, chief executive officer of the  Greenwood Village ,
Colorado-based company said April 27.  Newmont fell 0.5 percent to $47.61 at 3 p.m. in  New York .
Buenaventura dropped 2.2 percent to $41.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
