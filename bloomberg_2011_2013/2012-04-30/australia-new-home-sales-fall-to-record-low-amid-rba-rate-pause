Australian new-home sales dropped
in March to a record low, the Housing Industry Association said
in a report that urged the central bank to cut interest rates by
half a percentage point when it meets tomorrow.  Total sales declined 9.4 percent to 5,443 from a month
earlier, the Canberra-based industry group said in a statement
today. Detached house sales slumped by 9.7 percent and
apartments sales fell 6.9 percent, it said.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia “needs to send a clear
signal that it is back on the case of assisting an economy that
is clearly weaker than anticipated in 2012,” said  Harley Dale ,
HIA’s chief economist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
