Most  U.K. stocks  advanced, with the
 FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index rebounding from two months of losses, as  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  reported profit that beat estimates.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index increased 8.96, or 0.2
percent, to 5,746.74 at 8:04 a.m. in  London , as four shares rose
for every one that declined. The gauge retreated 0.5 percent
last month as Britain slipped into a double-dip recession and
concerns that the euro-area debt crisis may deepen returned. The
FTSE All-Share Index added 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index gained 0.4 percent.  Lloyds climbed 2.2 percent to 31.7 pence after Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender said first-quarter profit more than
doubled as impairments shrank.  Pretax profit, excluding one-time items and asset sales,
rose to 628 million pounds ($1 billion) from 284 million pounds
in the year-earlier period, the London-based bank said. Analysts
had predicted a profit of 422 million pounds, according to the
median estimate of seven surveyed by Bloomberg. Total
impairments fell by 36 percent, helped by the lender’s Irish and
Australian units.  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Europe ’s second-largest oil company, dropped 2.1
percent to 435.65 pence as it said first-quarter net income fell
to $5.9 billion from $7.3 billion a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
