German stocks  fell, with the
benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index posting its first monthly loss this year, as
Spain reentered a recession and a U.S. gauge showed a larger
drop in business activity than forecast.  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  slid 2 percent after New York-based
rival NYSE Euronext reported a decline in profit.  Adidas AG (ADS) 
rallied 5.3 percent to a record high after reporting better-
than-estimated net income and raising its 2012 outlook.  The DAX slipped 0.6 percent to 6,761.19 at the close of
trading in  Frankfurt . The gauge has lost 2.7 percent in April,
trimming its gains so far this year to 15 percent, as higher
Spanish bond yields renewed concern the region’s sovereign-debt
crisis may deepen. The broader HDAX Index also dropped 0.6
percent today.  “Worse-than-expected economic data out of the U.S. left
European equities ending the month of April on a rather sour
note,” said Markus Huber, head of German sales trading at ETX
Capital in  London . “In light of tomorrow’s Labor Day and the
second round of French presidential elections being not far off,
many traders are preferring to take a wait-and-see attitude by
taking some money off the table until things are clearer.”  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 32 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The German market is closed tomorrow for
the May Day holiday.  Spanish Recession  In  Spain ,  gross domestic product  fell 0.3 percent in the
first quarter, the same as in the previous three months, the
Madrid-based National Statistics Institute said. That compares
with the Bank of Spain’s estimate on April 23 of a 0.4 percent
decline. From a year ago, GDP fell 0.4 percent, INE said.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its
U.S. business barometer dropped to 56.2 in April from 62.2 a
month earlier, lower than the most pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Economists had projected the gauge would fall to 60,
according to the median of 55 estimates in the survey. Readings
greater than 50 signal growth.  German retail sales rebounded in March as declining
unemployment, slowing inflation and higher wages bolstered the
household purchasing power. Sales, adjusted for inflation and
seasonal swings, rose 0.8 percent from February, when they fell
a revised 0.9 percent. Economists forecast a gain of 1 percent,
the median projection in a Bloomberg survey. Sales increased 2.3
percent from a year earlier.  Deutsche Boerse  Deutsche Boerse  fell 2 percent to 47.43 euros, the first
drop in five days. NYSE Euronext, the exchange blocked from
merging with Deutsche Boerse in February, reported a 44 percent
decline in first-quarter profit on expenses related to the
takeover and a slowdown in trading.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s largest lender, retreated 1.9
percent to 32.87 euros.  MAN SE (MAN) , the German truckmaker controlled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,
slid 3.1 percent to 95.44 euros.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s third-largest cement
maker, fell 1.9 percent to 41.54 euros.  Bayer AG, the maker of drugs and chemicals, dropped 1.5
percent to 53.21 euros.  Adidas jumped 5.3 percent to 63 euros, the highest level
since the company’s initial public offering in 1995. The world’s
second-biggest sporting-goods maker said net income climbed 38
percent to 289 million euros ($383 million) in the first three
months of the year. That beat the 230.6 million-euro average
estimate of five analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The company
forecast a 12 percent to 17 percent increase in full-year
profit, compared with a previous prediction of 10 percent to 15
percent growth.  VW Slips  Volkswagen, the world’s second-largest carmaker, added 0.9
percent to 143.10 euros, its fifth day of gains.  Rheinmetall AG (RHM)  rose 1.8 percent to 42.43 euros. The maker
of KS Kolbenschmidt engine pistons plans an initial public
offering for its Kolbenschmidt Pierburg car-components division
in June and has started talks with institutional investors,
Boersen-Zeitung reported, citing unidentified people in the
financial industry.  Metro AG (MEO) , Germany’s largest retailer, added 2.6 percent to
24.38 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
