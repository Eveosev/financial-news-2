     May 1 (Bloomberg) --Two  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  employees,
were released in the Chinese city of Chongqing six months after
their arrest in connection with a probe into mislabeled pork,
said Christina Lee, a spokeswoman for the retailer.  Police in China arrested the two workers in October amid a
probe of the retailer for mislabeling ordinary pork as organic.
Their release comes after the Chinese Politburo’s suspension of
Bo Xilai, the city’s former Communist Party chief.  Lee declined to say why the employees had been released.
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, the world’s largest
retailer, was fined and ordered by local officials to halt
operations of some outlets during the probe in October. Anthony
Rose, another spokesman, said the two were released last week.  Wal-Mart later resumed operating the stores and said it was
reviewing management procedures in all  China  locations. The
company said at the time it had hired a management company to
improve third-party inspection, had given more training to
employees in Chongqing, and planned to set up facilities in the
city to check food quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
