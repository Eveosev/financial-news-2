Ethanol climbed to a two-week high
in  Chicago  on concern that global demand for U.S. corn will eat
into reserves.  Futures gained for a third day, the longest streak since
March 13, after the Agriculture Department said exporters sold
1.44 million metric tons of corn for delivery in the 2012-2013
marketing year that starts Sept. 1, the biggest sale in 18
years. One bushel of the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol in the U.S.  “It’s all linked to the corn,” said Jim Damask, a manager
at Biofuelsconnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based energy broker.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 3.1 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $2.228 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest price since April 12. Prices dropped 1.6
percent this month and are up 1.1 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  was unchanged
at $2.27 a gallon and in Chicago the additive increased 3 cents
to $2.20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 3 cents to $2.26 a gallon
and on the West Coast the biofuel gained 2 cents to $2.335.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 8.75 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $6.3425 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
