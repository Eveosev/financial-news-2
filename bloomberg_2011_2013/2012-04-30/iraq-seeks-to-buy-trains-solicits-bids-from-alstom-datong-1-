Iraq wants to buy 10 passenger
trains and has asked companies including  France ’s  Alstom SA (ALO)  to
submit bids, according to the country’s railway company.  Chinese businesses including Datong Electric Locomotive Co. 
have been invited to submit bids, as have manufacturers in
Turkey,  Iran  and Croatia, Jawad al-Kharsan, a spokesman for the
national railway, said in an interview in Baghdad today. The
winning company will have to supply two trains this year and the
remaining eight by 2013, he said.  The two new trains will run on a track linking the capital
Baghdad with the southern port city of Basra, he said. Iraq
bought 40,000 tons of railway track worth $50 million two years
ago to complete and upgrade Iraq’s railway grid, he said.  Iraq’s railway company has 100 passenger wagons that are
out of service and has invited the same companies to
rehabilitate 50 of them for five trains, Mohammad Ali Hashim,
head of the mechanical engineering department at the railway
company, said in a telephone interview in  Baghdad .  The company also owns about 1,000 cargo wagons that are
working and 4,000 that are out of service, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
