Lion Capital  LLP has entered
exclusive talks to buy the French eyeglass retailer Alain
Afflelou SA from its private equity owners Bridgepoint Advisers
Ltd. and Apax Partners LLP, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  Lion Capital last week offered about 800 million euros
($1.1 billion) as it vied with  Bain Capital  for the asset, one
of the people said. The buyout is set to be France’s largest
private equity deal so far this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Bridgepoint, a buyout fund manager based in London, bought
a majority stake in Alain Afflelou in 2006, when its eponymous
founder sought to plan his succession. The deal valued the
company at about 500 million euros.  Alain Afflelou operates a network of 1,100 optical retail
stores in  France , Spain, Switzerland and Portugal, according to
the company’s website.  Representatives of Lion Capital and Bridgepoint declined to
comment on the deal.  Dow Jones reported earlier that Lion Capital had bought the
company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
