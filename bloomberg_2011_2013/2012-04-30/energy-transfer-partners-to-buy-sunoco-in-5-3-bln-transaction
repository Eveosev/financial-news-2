Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP)  agreed
to buy  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  for about $5.3 billion in units and cash,
expanding ETP’s geographic reach and strengthening its presence
in the transportation, storage  and logistics of oil and gas.  The offer of $25 a share in cash and 0.56245 unit is valued
at $50.13 per share, based on ETP’s closing price April 27.  ETP in March completed its $5.4 billion purchase of
pipeline operator Southern Union Co.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
