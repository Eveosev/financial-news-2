Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  said the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service is reviewing an executive-
incentive program that allowed Chief Executive Officer  Aubrey McClendon  to buy stakes in thousands of the company’s oil and
natural-gas wells.  The IRS is examining the so-called Founders’ Well
Participation Program as part of its audits of Chesapeake’s 2008
and 2009 income-tax returns, the Oklahoma City-based company
said today in a regulatory  filing .  Chesapeake has been in talks with the IRS and said the
resolution probably won’t have a material impact on the company.  Chesapeake last week announced plans to halt the well-
participation program after news reports called into question
the propriety of McClendon’s use of well stakes as collateral to
obtain loans.  The IRS review of the well program wasn’t mentioned in the
Feb. 29 filing that disclosed the agency’s review of the
company’s 2007, 2008 and 2009 tax returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
