Overseas  investors  sold a net  3.31
billion rupees  ($62.9 million) of Indian stocks on April 27 and
in a special trading session on April 28, reducing their
investment in the equities this year to 428.4 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 20.8 billion rupees of shares and sold
24.1 billion rupees over the two days, the Securities & Exchange
Board of  India  said on its  website  today. Foreign funds sold a
net 16.8 billion rupees of bonds over the period, paring their
inflow into debt this year to 156.1 billion rupees, the data
 show . They put 421 billion rupees in bonds in 2011.  They’ve sold a net 11.1 billion rupees of shares this month
after being net buyers in each of the first three months of
2012.  Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  last month proposed to
introduce the General Anti-Avoidance Rules to check evasion of
taxes by companies through misuse of tax treaties with nations.
Offshore funds are concerned the new rules, which must be passed
by lawmakers, will apply to their holdings of local shares.  Foreigners have invested 4.872 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.363 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  the
best performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-
ever outflow in 2008 led to the biggest annual slump of 52
percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the Sensex, the second-worst annual
loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
