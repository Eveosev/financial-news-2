Italy  may post an unexpected budget
gap of as much as 20 billion euros ($26.5 billion) by mid-year
due to the government’s austerity measures, former Finance
Minister  Giulio Tremonti  told Corriere della Sera.  The implementation of a new property tax and changes to the
pension system passed in December will require extra financial
resources, Corriere cited Tremonti as saying. The shortfall will
also include as much as 8 billion euros to fund other programs
such as Italy’s international peacekeeping missions, Tremonti
said, according to the Milan-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
