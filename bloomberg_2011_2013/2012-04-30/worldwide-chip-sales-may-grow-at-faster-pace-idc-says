Global semiconductor revenue is
expected to rise at a faster pace this year, prompting bigger
chipmakers to acquire smaller rivals to increase their market
share, according to research company IDC.  Industrywide revenue may expand by between 6 percent and 7
percent this year, IDC said in a statement today. Global
semiconductor sales rose 3.7 percent to $301 billion in 2011, as
orders for chips used in wireless devices offset declining
revenue for computing-related chips, IDC said.  Mergers and acquisitions among chipmakers will continue,
after  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  bought Atheros Communications Inc. and  Texas
Instruments Inc. (TXN)  took over National Semiconductor Corp. last
year, according to IDC. The industry consolidation may allow
bigger chipmakers to offer products that are used in a wider
range of applications, the researcher said.  “As large companies with strong cash balances vie for
competitive positions, mergers and acquisitions will be a key
theme,” IDC said. “There is a trend underway toward more
integration.”  Intel Corp. (INTC) ,  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Texas Instruments,
 Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and Renesas Electronics Corp. were the world’s
five biggest chipmakers last year, according to IDC.  Lower prices for computer memory chips caused revenue from
personal-computer semiconductors to fall last year, according to
IDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
