The Badminton Horse Trials, which
would have helped select contestants for this summer’s Olympic
eventing equestrian competition, have been canceled because of
flooding, organizers said.  “The recent exceptional rainfall has left the ground at
Badminton totally waterlogged and partially flooded,”  British
Eventing  said in a statement on its website. “Further rain is
due this week, leaving no chance of the ground drying out.”  The annual Badminton horse trials, among the toughest in
the world, had been scheduled for May 2-3 in Gloucestershire,
southwest  England . They were last canceled because of bad
weather in 1987.  Britain has experienced heavy rainfall in recent weeks
following a period of drought. There are 37 flood warnings in
place as well as 139 flood alerts, mainly for the Southwest,
according to the Environment Agency website.  Horse racing has also been affected by the weather, with
events scheduled this week at Ascot, Windsor, Folkestone and
Towcester all being abandoned because of waterlogged tracks.  The Olympic eventing competition is made up of three
disciplines: dressage, show-jumping and cross-country. The
equestrian events at the London Olympics will be held at
Greenwich, southeast London.  To contact the reporter for this story:
