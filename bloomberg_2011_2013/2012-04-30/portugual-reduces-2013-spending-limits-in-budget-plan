The  Portuguese government  reduced
spending limits for next year as part of its effort to curb debt
and regain access to bond markets.  The government will reduce its primary  spending  limit by
3.2 percent in 2013 and lower the limit for total spending by
2.1 percent, according to a statement handed out to reporters
after a Cabinet meeting in Lisbon today. The plans are included
in the government’s budget outline for the 2013-2016 period.  The economy will be in a recession this year and 2013 will
be the start “of the economic recovery,” Finance Minister
Vitor Gaspar said at a press conference today. Gaspar also said
the government is sticking to its target for a  budget deficit  of
3 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, when the ratio of
debt-to-GDP is forecast to peak at 115.7 percent.  Portugal is cutting spending and increasing taxes to comply
with the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($103 billion) aid plan from
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund . Prime
Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said on March 5 that if the country
can’t access bond markets by September 2013 due to “external
reasons,” it would be able to count on continued support from
the IMF and the EU.  The government narrowed its budget deficit to 4.2 percent
of GDP in 2011 from 9.8 percent in 2010 after bank pension funds
were transferred to the state, and plans a shortfall of 4.5
percent in 2012.  Portugal ’s debt is forecast to peak at about
115 percent of GDP in 2013, the IMF forecasts.  The government predicts the  economy  will shrink 3 percent
this year and expand 0.6 percent in 2013, according to the
budget plan. In March it forecast a 3.3 percent contraction in
GDP for 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
