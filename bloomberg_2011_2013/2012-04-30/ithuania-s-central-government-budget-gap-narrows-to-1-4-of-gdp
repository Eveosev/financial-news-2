Lithuania’s central government
budget had a deficit of 1.4 percent of  gross domestic product  in
the first quarter, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The shortfall, calculated on a cash basis, narrowed from
1.5 percent of GDP in the first three months of last year, the
ministry, based in the capital, Vilnius, said today in a
statement on its website. The measure includes all public
finances except municipal budgets.  Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’s government is seeking to
narrow the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP this year from 5.5
percent in 2011. Government debt rose to 39.1 percent of GDP at
the end of March from 39 percent in February, the ministry said
in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
