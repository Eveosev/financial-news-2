The  World Bank ’s private-sector
financing arm is considering $9 million in debt and equity
funding for a project in Sri Lanka that will sell electricity
produced from burning municipal waste.  RenewGen Enviro Ventures India Pvt. won a 25-year contract
to build and operate a 10-megawatt plant in Sri Lanka’s Western
Province, according to a  summary  of the proposed funding on the
International Finance Corp.’s website.  The $29 million project will be able to incinerate as much
as 580 metric tons a day of solid municipal waste. Japan’s
 Hitachi Zosen Corp. (7004)  will provide the technology and the
electricity will be sold to the Ceylon Electricity Board,
according to IFC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
