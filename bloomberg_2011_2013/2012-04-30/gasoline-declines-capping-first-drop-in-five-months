Gasoline capped the first monthly
drop since November as reports showing weakness in  Europe ’s
economy added to concern that global demand will slow.  Futures fell with crude, which declined for the first time
in seven days, after Spain’s gross domestic product dropped in
the first quarter and Italy’s inflation remained at a six-month
high. The euro weakened against the dollar, reducing the appeal
of commodities as an investment alternative.  “Gasoline is being dragged down by crude  oil prices ,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. “There’s quite a bit of concern about Spain and Italy.
The anticipation is that the economies there will slow and
reduce oil demand.”  Gasoline for May delivery fell 2.18 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $3.1844 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price, which dropped 6.1 percent in April, has
gained 19 percent this year. The May contract expired today. The
more-active June gasoline contract decreased 1.99 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.1246.  Spain’s gross domestic product fell 0.3 percent, the same
as in the previous quarter, the Madrid-based National Statistics
Institute said. Italy’s inflation rate was unchanged at 3.8
percent, Rome-based national statistics office Istat said in a
preliminary report.  The euro weakened as much as 0.4 percent against the
dollar. The dollar also gained after the Commerce Department
said  consumer spending  in the U.S. climbed 0.3 percent in March,
after a revised 0.9 percent gain the prior month, the biggest
since August 2009.  ‘Sticky Trouble’  “We’re getting the realization that Europe is in a bit of
sticky trouble,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at
OptionSellers.com in Tampa,  Florida . “All these steps that are
being taken are going to weaken the economy.”  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.3
cent to $3.816 a gallon yesterday, the lowest level since March
13, according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the largest U.S.
motoring club. Prices have dropped 12 cents from the 2012 high
of $3.936 on April 4.  May-delivery heating oil climbed 0.27 cent to $3.1834 a
gallon. Heating oil for June rose 0.07 cent to $3.1842.  To contact the reporter on this story:
