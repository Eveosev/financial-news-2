Carl Shapiro, one of three members
of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, is leaving his
position soon to return to teaching at the  University of
California  at Berkeley, an administration official said.  Shapiro took a sabbatical to work at the White House for
approximately three years and that period is coming to an end,
according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the departure hasn’t been announced.  Shapiro had been a member of Berkeley’s faculty since 1990,
most recently as the Transamerica Professor of Business Strategy
at the Haas School of Business and professor of economics,
according to the university’s website.  He also served as deputy assistant attorney general for
economics at the Antitrust Division of the  U.S. Department of
Justice  from 2009 to 2011, according to the website.  The job of the council, created by Congress in 1946, is to
give the president objective analysis of domestic and
international economic policy. The chairman is Alan Krueger, an
economics professor from  Princeton University . The other member
is Katharine Abraham, who is on leave from the University of
 Maryland .  Selections for the council are subject to Senate
confirmation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
