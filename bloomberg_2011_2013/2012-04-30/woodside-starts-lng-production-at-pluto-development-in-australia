Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,
Australia’s second-biggest oil producer, started producing
liquefied natural gas at its A$14.9 billion ($15.6 billion)
Pluto project after a delay of more than a year.  The first cargo of LNG will soon be loaded for shipment,
Perth-based Woodside said today in a statement. Woodside last
year increased Pluto’s estimated cost for the third time in 19
months and delayed the target for exports by six additional
months to March 2012.  Pluto, approved by Woodside in 2007, becomes Australia’s
third LNG project after the Woodside-led North West Shelf
venture and ConocoPhillips’ Darwin LNG plant. Seven more LNG
projects planned by companies, including  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , are being developed in  Australia .  “Pluto cements Woodside’s position as a major supplier of
LNG to the Asia-Pacific region,” the company said today.  The Woodside project may help Australia surpass Qatar as
the world’s biggest LNG supplier by the end of the decade,
although the proposed developments in Australia face rising
construction costs and increasing supply competition.  Pluto is set to contribute an equivalent of 17 million to
21 million barrels of oil to Woodside’s production this year and
eventually deliver an average of 37 million barrels of oil
equivalent to annual output, Woodside said in March. Woodside on
April 19 maintained its target of producing 73 million to 81
million barrels of oil equivalent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
