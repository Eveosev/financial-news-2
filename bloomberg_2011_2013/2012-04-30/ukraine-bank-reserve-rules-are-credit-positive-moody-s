A planned change in reserve rules
for banks in Ukraine are credit positive for the lenders,
according to Moody’s Elena Redko.  “On April 18, the National Bank of Ukraine, the country’s
central bank, declared its intention to allow banks to unblock
up to 100 percent of non-interest bearing mandatory reserves  --
up from 40 percent -- for use in intraday liquidity
management,” Redko wrote in the rating company’s weekly credit
outlook published today. “Despite easing a prudential measure,
we consider this action as credit positive for Ukrainian
banks.”  “While the NBU will still maintain daily supervision of
unblocked reserves, the measure will increase the banks’
intraday liquidity positions by $1.8 billion (1.4 percent of
system assets) and improve profitability, as a portion of these
funds are reallocated to interest-yielding assets,” she said in
the note.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
