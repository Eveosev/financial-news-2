Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the
second-largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer by
market value, said first-quarter profit rose on higher crude
prices and a $1.8 billion gain from an Algerian tax settlement.  Net income climbed to $2.16 billion, or $4.28 a share, from
$216 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier, The Woodlands, Texas-
based company said in a statement today. Excluding the Algerian
tax settlement and other one-time items, per-share profit was
nine cents more than the 83-cent average of 30 analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company announced on March 9 it had reached a tax
settlement with Sonatrach,  Algeria ’s state-owned oil company,
that would increase revenue by $1.8 billion over 12 months and
boost Anadarko’s share of crude from Algerian wells. The
company will receive $1 billion in cash this year and the
remainder during the first half of next year, according to
today’s statement.  Sales increased 6.2 percent to $3.45 billion. First-quarter
sales volume was the equivalent of 64 million barrels of oil,
beating a quarterly forecast given in March of 61 million to 63
million barrels,  John Christiansen , a spokesman for Anadarko,
said in a telephone interview.  Brent crude futures, a benchmark global oil price, gained
12 percent from a year earlier to average $118.45 a barrel in
the first quarter. Gas futures traded in  New York  averaged
$2.503 per million British thermal units in the quarter, a
decline of 40 percent from a year earlier.  Higher Sales Estimates  Anadarko boosted its sales-volume guidance for 2012 to a
range of 258 million to 262 million barrels of oil equivalent,
helped by an increase in volumes from amended contract terms in
Algeria, according to the statement. The previous forecast was
for a range of 256 million to 260 million barrels.  Today’s earnings report was issued after the close of
regular trading in New York. Anadarko rose 1.1 percent to $74 at
5:47 p.m. in New York.  Independent  oil companies  focus on finding and producing
crude and gas and don’t own any refineries.  Apache Corp. (APA)  is the
largest U.S. independent producer.  (Anadarko will hold an earnings conference call tomorrow at
10 a.m. New York time. To listen, go to
