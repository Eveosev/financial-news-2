Buffets Holdings Inc., the operator
of the Old Country Buffet restaurant chain, won court approval
to send its reorganization plan to creditors for a vote.  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  Judge Mary F. Walrath approved a so-
called disclosure statement, which is written to help creditors
decide whether to vote in favor of the plan. Under the plan,
first-lien lenders owed about $252 million will trade the right
to collect that debt for ownership of Buffets, according to the
disclosure statement.  A committee of lower-ranking, unsecured creditors dropped
their opposition to the reorganization plan after the company
agreed to set up a litigation trust controlled by those
creditors and funded with at least $4 million. The trust will
pursue lawsuits that may generate more money for unsecured
creditors and would share in any proceeds should Buffets be sold
sell for more than $200 million, according to the disclosure
statement.  “The committee endorses the plan,” the panel said in a
letter to unsecured creditors owed about $44.6 million. The
company had about 22,800 employees as of January.  Creditor votes are due June 4 and the company will return
to court June 13 to seek approval of the plan.  Buffets, based in Eagan,  Minnesota , filed bankruptcy in
January for the second time in four years with a plan to cut
debt by about $245 million. While in bankruptcy, Buffets closed
a number of unprofitable restaurants, the company said.  The case is In re Buffets Holdings Inc., 12-10237, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
