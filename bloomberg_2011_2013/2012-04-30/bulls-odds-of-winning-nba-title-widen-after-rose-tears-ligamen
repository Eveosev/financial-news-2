The  Chicago Bulls ’ chances of
capturing their first National Basketball Association title
since the Michael Jordan era tumbled after reigning Most
Valuable Player  Derrick Rose  suffered a season-ending injury.  The Bulls’ odds to win the championship widened to 12-1,
from 4-1 before their 103-91 Game 1 win against the  Philadelphia
76ers  two days ago, RJ Bell, the founder of the handicapping
information website Pregame.com, said in a telephone interview.  “The playoffs are a different animal to the regular
season, and one of the things you need in the postseason is a
superstar, so losing someone like Rose has a big effect,” Bell
said. “My feeling is the move to 12-1 is a bit drastic.”  Rose, 23, will take no further part in the postseason after
tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee late in
the opening game of the best-of-seven series.  “It’s not a death sentence for him, it’s not a death
sentence for our team,” Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau told
reporters. “He’ll come back better than ever. It’s just the way
it is and we’ve got to deal with it.”
With Rose, the Bulls were favored to win Game 1 by nine points,
Bell said. Without him, they’re six-point favorites to take Game
2, which also will be played at the United Center in  Chicago , on
May 1.  The Bulls have an 83 percent chance of advancing to the
second round, compared with a 93 percent at the outset of the
playoffs, Bell said.  Missed 27 Games  Rose, who scored 23 points against the 76ers, averaged 21.8
points and 3.4 rebounds this season. He missed 27 of 66 regular-
season games because of injuries. The Bulls won 18 of those
games and lost nine when he didn’t play.  “It’s a sad win,” Kyle Korver told reporters after the
76ers game. “It’s been a hard year for him. All the work that
he puts in, just the kind of person he is, to see something like
that happen, you know it stinks.”  The Bulls won all six of their NBA titles with Jordan,
taking three straight from 1991-93 and repeating the feat from
1996-98. They missed the playoffs the next six years and last
season lost in the conference finals to the  Miami Heat , their
best performance since Jordan retired.  Luol Deng  was Chicago’s second-highest scorer during the
regular season, averaging 15.3 points per game, followed by
 Carlos Boozer  with 15, Richard Hamilton with 11.6 and Joakim Noah with 10.2. Against Philadelphia, Hamilton scored 19 points,
Deng had 17 and Noah contributed 12 points and 13 rebounds.  Watson to Start  In Rose’s absence, C.J. Watson will start Game 2. Watson,
28, averaged 9.7 points, 4.1 assists and 2.1 rebounds in the
regular season.  The Bulls, the top seed in the Eastern Conference, never
trailed in Game 1 after taking a 4-3 lead. Rose was injured
after returning to the game with 7:52 to play and with the Bulls
leading by 12 points. Hamilton said Chicago needed Rose back in
the game to keep the 76ers from closing the deficit.  “Philly was making a run,” Hamilton said. “We needed
guys that could put the ball in the basket.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
