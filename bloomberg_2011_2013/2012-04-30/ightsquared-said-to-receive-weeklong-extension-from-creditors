LightSquared Inc., the wireless-
network company backed by billionaire  Philip Falcone , received a
weeklong extension from its creditors, helping stave off a
default, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The creditors have requested that Falcone step aside as
part an agreement, though the negotiations are still under way,
said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the
discussions are private. Bondholders, including  Carl Icahn ,
 Andrew Beal  and  David Tepper , had given Falcone a deadline of
today to revisit a waiver that avoided triggering a technical
default on its debt.  Falcone’s original plan for LightSquared depended on
winning the  U.S. Federal Communications Commission ’s approval to
convert airwaves designated for satellite service to spectrum
for land-based radio towers. The Reston, Virginia-based company
invested $4 billion in airwaves and reached deals with more than
30 partners, including Best Buy Co.  LightSquared hit a roadblock in February when the FCC said
it would withdraw preliminary approval for the company’s network
after government tests found that the signals would interfere
with global-positioning systems. The decision followed a
yearlong lobbying fight between LightSquared and GPS users and
providers. The Coalition to Save Our GPS, a group formed to
opposed LightSquared’s plans, included package shippers FedEx
Corp. and  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , GPS-equipment maker Garmin
Ltd. and farm-gear manufacturer Deere & Co.  Bankruptcy Considered  Falcone said earlier this year that he was considering
bankruptcy for LightSquared, though he would rather get the
government to swap his spectrum for that controlled by the U.S.
Department of Defense.  Mike Sitrick , a spokesman for Falcone, declined to comment.
Icahn didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the weeklong
extension.  On March 16, Sprint Nextel Corp. handed LightSquared one of
its biggest setbacks when it ended an 11-year agreement to
build, operate and share the network. LightSquared paid Sprint
$310 million in advance, and Sprint said in a securities filing
Feb. 27 that it would return $65 million of the payments it has
received from LightSquared.  LightSquared had originally agreed to pay  Overland Park ,
Kansas-based Sprint $9 billion for the network duties and issue
an additional $4.5 billion in service credits. The deal hinged
on approval from the FCC.  CEO’s Exit  On Feb. 28, soon after the FCC decision, Chief Executive
Officer  Sanjiv Ahuja  resigned. The company appointed Falcone to
the board as it began a search for a new CEO. LightSquared also
cut 45 percent of its 330-member staff to preserve cash.  The company said the government tests were rigged and the
results were bogus. LightSquared has vowed to work on a solution
to the interference issue. On March 13, the company said it
hired litigators  Theodore Olson  and Eugene Scalia of Gibson Dunn
& Crutcher LLP in preparation for a possible legal battle with
U.S. regulators.  After skipping two payments to Inmarsat Plc in February and
March for what it called incomplete work, LightSquared made a
$56.3 million payment to the British satellite partner earlier
this month. The payment gave LightSquared a two-year extension
on the next payment deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
