German stocks advanced as retail
sales rebounded in March and  Spain ’s economy shrank less than
estimated in the first quarter.  Adidas AG rose after reporting better-than-forecast
quarterly net income and raising its 2012 outlook. Volkswagen AG
climbed, for the longest rally since Jan. 5. Metro AG, Germany’s
largest retailer, also advanced.  The DAX rose 0.2 percent to 6,814.78 at 10:49 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The broader HDAX Index also added 0.2 percent today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
