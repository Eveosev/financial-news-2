The Serbian central bank sold euros
to banks for a sixth consecutive trading session today, limiting
the declines in the dinar  exchange rate  ahead of May 6
elections.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 10 million
euros ($13.2 million) to “ensure the smooth functioning” of
the market, it said in a statement on its website. The dinar was
trading at 112.0537 to the euro at 4:00 p.m. in Belgrade, its
lowest in a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank has spent 708.5 million euros since the
start of 2012 to prop up the dinar, which has fallen 10 percent
against the euro compared with the same period last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
