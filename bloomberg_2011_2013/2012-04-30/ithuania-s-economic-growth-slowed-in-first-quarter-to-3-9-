Lithuania’s  economic growth  slowed
in the first quarter as the European debt crisis sapped demand
for the Baltic nation’s exports.  Gross domestic product grew a preliminary 3.9 percent from
a year earlier, compared with a 4.4 percent increase in the
previous three months, the  statistics office  in the capital
Vilnius said today by e-mail. The median estimate of six
economists in a Bloomberg survey was 3.5 percent. The economy
grew a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in the January-March
period.  Lithuania’s economy grew at the second-fastest pace in the
European Union in the fourth quarter before the crisis bit
exports. The  Finance Ministry  estimates economic growth may slow
to 2.5 percent this year from 5.9 percent last year.  The office is scheduled to release a breakdown of the
first-quarter GDP data on May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
