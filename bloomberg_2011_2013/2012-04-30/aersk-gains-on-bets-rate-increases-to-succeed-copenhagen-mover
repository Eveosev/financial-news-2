A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S (MAERSKB) , owner of
the world’s largest container line, rose for the fifth
consecutive day, the longest winning streak since Feb. 9 in
Copenhagen, on bets the industry will succeed in the next round
of freight rate increases.  Maersk’s B shares gained as much as 1.6 percent to 44,280
kroner, the highest price since April 3. The stock was up 0.9
percent at 44,000 kroner at 10:37 a.m. in the Danish capital.  Container lines, including Hanjin Shipping Co. rose in
Asian trading today as investors predicted that operators may be
able to raise rates next month, said Um Kyung A, a Seoul-based
Shinyoung Securities Co. analyst. China’s Export
Containerization Freight Index, which tracks rates on cargo
hauled from China, rose 4 percent at the end of last week,
boosting expectations for higher rates for shipments to Europe
and the U.S.  Members of the Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, which
include Hanjin and Copenhagen-based Maersk, plan to raise rates
next month for annual contracts by $500 per 40-foot container
shipped to the U.S. from  Asia .  Maersk’s container operations will lose money this year,
the company said Feb. 27. Maersk will publish first-quarter
results on May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
