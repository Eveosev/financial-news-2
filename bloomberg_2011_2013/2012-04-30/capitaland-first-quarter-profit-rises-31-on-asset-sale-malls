CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL) ,  Southeast Asia ’s
biggest developer, said first-quarter profit rose 31 percent as
gains from the sale of a hotel and higher shopping mall income
offset declines in residential earnings from Singapore and China.  Net income  increased to S$133.2 million ($108 million), or
3.1 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, from S$101.5
million, or 2.4 cents, a year earlier, it said today in a
statement to the Singapore stock exchange. That’s lower than the
S$149.4 million average of analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales climbed 4.8 percent to S$641.1 million.  Earnings were boosted by a S$28.8 million gain from the
sale of the Hilton Doubletree in Kunshan,  China , as well as a
higher valuation of its investment properties in China and  Japan ,
it said in the statement. Profits declined at residential
projects in Singapore and China, it said, two markets where
governments imposed measures to curb speculative home-buying.  “Singapore and China will remain key focus markets for new
investments,” Liew Mun Leong, president and chief executive
officer at Singapore-based CapitaLand, said in the statement.
“While the markets in both Singapore and China are adjusting to
the official cooling measures, the group expects the longer-term
demand to remain healthy.”  Pretax profit from Singapore declined 2.1 percent to
S$128.8 million, while China earnings before interest and taxes
dropped 38 percent to S$57.8 million, it said. The two are the
developer’s biggest markets. Singapore, China and  Australia 
contributed to 88.4 percent of revenues in the quarter compared
with 89.7 percent a year earlier, it said.  More Apartments  CapitaLand sold 844 units in Singapore in 2011, an increase
from a year ago. It sold 1,500 residential units valued at 3.1
billion yuan in China.  The developer has about 2,500 units under development and
expects to sell as many as 1,000 units a year over the next two
to three years, it said in its annual report. The developer’s
three core markets of Singapore, China and Australia accounted
for 79 percent of the group’s pretax profit.  CapitaLand will release more Singapore apartments units for
sale at the Interlace and d’Leedon this year, and started
selling the Moshe Safdie-designed  Sky Habitat , a 509-unit
project in Bishan, a suburb in the central part of the island.  In China, the developer said it’s releasing more units at
its Royal Residences in Beijing for sale, along with homes in
its existing developments. Ascott, the company’s serviced
apartment chain, will seek new investments in key Asian and
European cities to expand, the developer said.  CapitaLand increased its investments last year, committing
a total of S$11 billion for new investments, an 83 percent
increase from the S$6 billion worth of investments made in 2010.  The company’s  shares  were unchanged S$2.94 at the close of
trading in Singapore. The stock has gained 33 percent this year,
compared with the 13 percent advance in  Singapore ’s benchmark
Straits Times Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
