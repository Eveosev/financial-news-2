Thailand , which bought less than
0.1 percent of total U.S. beef exports in 2011, may suspend
imports from the U.S. after the first case of mad cow in six
years, according to the  U.S. Meat Export Federation .  While Thailand has not “officially informed” the
government that it is suspending U.S. access to its market, the
Denver-based federation informed its members that closure is a
“strong possibility,” said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the
group. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on April 24 that
a dairy cow in  California  was infected with mad cow disease, the
nation’s fourth case and the first since 2006.  “We’ve alerted our members that it’s a possibility that it
will be closing,” Schuele said in a telephone interview.
“We’re not certain it’s going to happen. We would prefer to see
people err on the side of caution. If you send product and the
market closes while it’s in route, that can be a big problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
