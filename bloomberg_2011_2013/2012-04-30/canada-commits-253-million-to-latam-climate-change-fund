Canada pledged C$250 million ($253
million) to a new fund that will help developing nations in
 Latin America  and the Caribbean reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  The Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in the
Americas will provide backing for projects that may eliminate as
much as 50 million metric tons of emissions over 25 years,
according to an e-mailed statement today from the Washington-
based Inter-American Development Bank, which will manage the
fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
