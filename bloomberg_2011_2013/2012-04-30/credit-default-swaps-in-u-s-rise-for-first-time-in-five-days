A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk increased for the first time in five days as a
measure of business activity in the nation slowed and as  Spain 
entered its second recession since 2009.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, added 0.6 basis point to a mid-price of 94.9
basis points at 5:09 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge, which reached a three-month
high of 104.3 on April 10, had dropped for four straight days.  The swaps index rose as a government report showed Spain’s
gross domestic product fell 0.3 percent in the first quarter,
fueling concern  Europe ’s debt crisis may damage the global
financial system. A separate report showed  business activity  in
the U.S. expanded at the slowest pace since the end of 2009.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its barometer decreased to 56.2 during April, lower than the
most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, from 62.2
in March. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  Credit-default swaps typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
