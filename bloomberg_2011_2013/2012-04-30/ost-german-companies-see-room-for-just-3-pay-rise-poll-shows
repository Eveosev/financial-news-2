companies see room for pay rises of 2 to 3 percent, while unions
want a 6.5 percent increase in the electrical and metal

by Forsa conceive of an increase of less than 2 percent in
current negotiations over future pay for workers, the newspaper
said. About 42  percent of managers will have to cut jobs, 23
pewrcent will need to cut costs in other areas and 11 percent
may opt to move parts of the business overseas if negotiations
lead to excessive wage increases, the poll showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
