Orkla ASA (ORK) ’s chief executive officer
stepped down after the Norwegian company that is selling assets
to focus on consumer brands reported that earnings fell 57
percent in the first quarter.  Bjoern Wiggen resigned after 19 months on job and Aage Korsvold was appointed acting CEO, the Oslo-based company said
in a statement. Net income fell to 1.3 billion kroner ($227
million) from 3 billion kroner a year earlier, the company said.  “The change of CEO entails no change in Orkla’s
strategy,” Chairman Stein Erik Hagen said in the statement.
“The company intends to strengthen its position as the leading
branded goods company in the Nordic region. At the same time,
the company’s non-core businesses will be divested.”  Hagen, a Norwegian billionaire, has pushed the company to
sell assets such as its 39.7 percent stake in Renewable Energy
Corp. ASA. The brands business, which makes everything from
Grandiosa frozen pizzas to Pierre Robert hosiery, has also been
expanding with acquisitions.  “My primary task will be to drive the transformation of
Orkla into a pure branded goods company,” Korsvold said in the
statement. “Orkla is the leading brand builder in the Nordic
region. We will build on the group’s strong market positions to
create a stronger Orkla.”  The company said the process for finding a new CEO has
begun, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
