Centrum Klima SA (CKL) , the Polish
ventilation and air-conditioning wholesaler, surged to the
highest in 10 months after Swedenâ€™s  Lindab International AB (LIAB) 
attempted to buy the company.  The shares gained as much as 26.1 percent to 14.13 zloty,
the highest level since July, and traded 25 percent stronger at
9:44 a.m. in Warsaw, valuing the company at 119.3 million zloty
($37.9 million).  Lindab will complete the purchase of 51.8 percent stake in
Centrum Klima today at 14.5 zloty per share, and it will
announce a cash tender offer for the remaining stake at the same
price on May 2, the Swedish company said in a statement on April
27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
