Germany  installed about 650
megawatts of solar panels in the first two months of the year,
almost double the amount compared with the same period of 2011,
the Bundesnetzagentur grid regulator said in a website
statement.  Installations rose to about 450 megawatts in January and
about 200 megawatts in February, the regulator said. Germany,
the world’s second-biggest solar market last year, added about
266 megawatts and 100 megawatts in the same period of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
