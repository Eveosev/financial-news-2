South Korea ’s  inflation  moderated to a
21-month low in April, giving the central bank more leeway to
hold off increasing interest rates.  Consumer prices increased 2.5 percent from a year earlier,
after a 2.6 percent gain in March, Statistics Korea said today
in Gwacheon, south of Seoul. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 13 economists was for a 2.8 percent gain. Prices
were unchanged from March.  Asian nations should prepare to “shift gears” and tighten
monetary policy as their economies strengthen and inflationary
pressures rise, the  International Monetary Fund  said last week.
The  Bank of Korea  reiterated in April that monetary policy will
aim to stabilize consumer price gains at 3 percent over time.  “Consumer inflation may creep up due to higher gas prices
and some public service fees,” Lee Sang Jae, a senior economist
at Hyundai Securities Co. in  Seoul , said before the release.
“Still, inflation will likely stay around 3 percent well into
the third quarter, helping policy makers delay rate hikes.”  The won strengthened 0.4 percent to close at 1,130.13 per
dollar in Seoul yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Kospi Index gained 0.3 percent.  Core consumer prices, which exclude oil and agricultural
products, advanced 1.8 percent in April from a year earlier,
today’s report showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
