Sugar-cane output in the main
growing region in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer of the
sweetener, will be lower than previously forecast for the season
starting this month, according to Archer Consulting.  Cane production in center south will total 508 million
metric tons in 2012-13, below the prior 512 million-ton
estimate, Arnaldo Luiz Correa, a director at the Sao Paulo-based
consultancy, said in a report e-mailed April 28. The estimate
was Archer’s fourth for the crop. Production in 2011-12 was
493.3 million tons, according to industry group Unica.  Millers in the region will produce 32.51 million tons of
sugar, above a previous forecast of 32.47 million tons, as more
cane is used to make the sweetener rather than ethanol,
according to Archer’s report. Sugar output in the region
amounted to 31.3 million tons in 2011-12, Unica data show.  Ethanol production may be 21.2 billion liters (5.6 billion
gallons), down from a previous forecast of 21.4 billion liters,
Archer estimated. Millers in the area produced 20.5 billion
liters of the biofuel last season, according to Unica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
