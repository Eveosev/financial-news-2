Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  rose 0.4 percent to 4,180.73.
The gauge advanced 1.4 percent this month, its fifth month of
gains. That’s the longest stretch of monthly gains since July
2011.  PT Adaro Energy (ADRO)  , Indonesia’s second-largest coal
producer, gained 2.8 percent to 1,860 rupiah, the sharpest
increase since March 2. Adaro said first-quarter production rose
3.4 percent to 10.96 million metric tons from 10.6 million tons
in the same period last year. Adaro remains on track to reach
its 2012 full-year output target of 50 million to 53 million
tons, it said in a statement.  PT Berau Coal Energy (BRAU)  , a coal producer, declined
5.6 percent to 510 rupiah, the biggest drop since Nov. 1. Berau
said its first-quarter net income sank 66 percent from a year
earlier to $12 million.  PT Bank Danamon Indonesia (BDMN)  , which  Singapore ’s DBS
Group Holdings Ltd. plans to acquire, fell 5.1 percent to 5,600
rupiah, the lowest close since March 30. DBS’ bid might face new

the takeover is pending a new bank ownership rule and on a
reciprocity agreement with Singapore’s monetary authority, PT
Kim Eng Securities wrote in a note.  PT Indofood Sukses Makmur (INDF)  , the parent company of
Indonesia’s biggest instant-noodle maker, climbed 3.2 percent to
