Tanzania, which vies with  Mali  to
be  Africa ’s third-biggest gold producer, increased shipments of
the metal to a record last year as prices climbed.  Exports grew to $1.9 billion from $1.4 billion a year
earlier, according to provisional Mines Ministry data provided
by acting Commissioner Ally Samaje. The central bank will
release final data later this year. The value of gold shipments
rose even as output dropped to 37,000 kilograms (81,571 pounds)
from about 40,000 kilograms a year earlier, he said.  “The increase in exports is attributed to higher prices of
gold on the international market,” Samaje said in an interview
in Arusha, 330 kilometers (205 miles) north of the capital,
Dodoma. Apr. 27. Bullion for immediate delivery rose 13 percent
to $1,563.70 in  London  last year.  Tanzania earned 876.3 billion shillings from its gold,
silver and copper resources since 1998, when gold mining began
in the East African nation.  African Barrick Gold Plc (ABG)  and
Resolute Mining Ltd. own mines in the country. Total receipts
from minerals increased to $2 billion last year from $1.5
billion in 2010, generating 2.6 percent of gross domestic
product in the region’s second-biggest economy.  Gold production may drop further next year when African
Barrick’s Tulawaka mine and Resolute’s Golden Pride operations
are scheduled to be closed, according to Samaje.  “In Tulawaka, Barrick will conclude surface mining next
year,” Samaje said. “They have an option to go for underground
production, or close. We have already given them permit for
underground production at Tulawaka.”  Deo Mwanyika, vice president in charge of corporate affairs
at African Barrick, didn’t answer his mobile phone when
Bloomberg called three times today seeking comment.  Feasibility Study  African Barrick’s Nyanzaga project in Sengerema district
has yet to produce a feasibility study and the process may take
as long as four years before production starts, Samaje said.  “The upcoming projects will still take time, which means
our ambition of reaching annual production of 50,000 kilograms
may not be achieved soon,” he said.  Gold output in Tanzania peaked at 48,000 kilograms in 2004,
from which the country earned $596 million in shipments,
according to the ministry’s data. The other company operating in
Tanzania is  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , which owns the Geita Gold
Mine, the biggest by output.  Shipments of diamonds dropped to $7.5 million last year,
the lowest in 11 years, from $16.3 million in 2010, as output
dropped to 28,377 carats from 80,498 carats, the data showed.  “This is because production was stopped at Mwandui to
rehabilitate the old processing plant,” Samaje said.  Shipments of tanzanite dropped to an estimated $22.8
million last year from $25.4 million in 2010, even as production
increased 17 percent to 15,000 kilograms (33,000 pounds) in the
same period, according to the data.  Silver exports jumped to $11.6 million from $7.7 million,
as output fell to 12,000 kilograms from 10,400 kilograms, while
copper shipments fell to $30.2 million from $37 million,
according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
