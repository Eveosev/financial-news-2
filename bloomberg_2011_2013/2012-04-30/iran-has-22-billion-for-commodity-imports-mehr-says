Iran  has allocated some $22 billion
for the import of basic commodities including rice, sugar, and
meat this year,  Mehr  reported, citing deputy commerce minister
Mohammad-Ali Zeighami.  The funds, to be provided by the government to the Ministry
of Industries, Mines and Commerce, are for the Iranian year
started on March 20th, Zeighami said, according to the state-run
news agency report. Last year the ministry was provided with $20
billion, he said.  Commodities such as rice, cooking oil, sugar, wheat,
barley, soybeans and meat, in which Iran’s local production
isn’t sufficient may be imported, Zeighami said.  Food prices have soared in recent months, which the Iranian
government has attributed to an increase in food prices in the
global markets, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
