Humana Inc. (HUM) , the second-biggest
provider of U.S.-backed Medicare insurance, said first-quarter
profit declined as premiums failed to keep up with rising
medical costs. The company raised its full-year forecast.  Net income  dropped 21 percent to $248 million, or $1.49 a
share, from $315 million, or $1.86, a year earlier, the
Louisville, Kentucky-based company said today in a statement.
The per-share result missed by 2 cents the $1.51 average of 9
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose to $10.2
billion, from $9.2 billion a year earlier.  The slowdown in medical procedures that had boosted health
plan earnings for two years may be ending,  Aetna Inc. (AET)  executives
said last week, after reporting profit that missed estimates.
Humana Chief Executive Officer Michael McCallister has also
predicted a rebound in medical costs, along with declining
profit margins, said Chris Rigg, a Susquehanna Financial Group
analyst.  The company anticipated “significant upticks in
utilization across its commercial and Medicare businesses,”
Rigg said in an April 15 note to clients.  The insurer said 2012 earnings will be $7.55 to $7.75 a
share, after providing a full-year outlook  of  $7.50 to $7.70 in
February. Analysts had estimated $8.09.  Humana declined 1.5 percent to $87.82 in New York trading
on April 27. The shares gained 16 in the 12 months before today.
UnitedHealth, based in  Minnetonka ,  Minnesota , is the leading
Medicare insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
