Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services ,
the country’s second-biggest mobile network operator, reported a
first-quarter loss after costs rose as the company upgrades its
network.  The  net loss  for the three months ended March 31 was 74
million Egyptian pounds ($12.2 million) after reporting a 23
million-pound profit in the same period last year, the Cairo-
based company known as Mobinil said in an e-mailed statement
today. The  average of five analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg was for a profit of 2 million pounds.  Mobinil, which may be acquired by  France Telecom SA (FTE) , said
depreciation and amortization as a result of the partial upgrade
of the company’s network to 3G from 2G swelled to 701 million
pounds from 558 million pounds a year-earlier. Mobinil has
reported a net loss in three of the last four quarters.  Revenue rose 3.9 percent to 2.53 billion pounds in the
first quarter and subscribers grew 7.5 percent to 32.6 million,
it said.  “The results signal that Mobinil’s recovery is underway
and that the changes we have implemented to our business to
recover from previous unfavorable conditions have started to pay
off,” Yves Gauthier, the company’s chief executive officer,
said in the statement.  Shares of Mobinil  gained 0.2 percent to 195.2 pounds in
Cairo, the highest level in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
