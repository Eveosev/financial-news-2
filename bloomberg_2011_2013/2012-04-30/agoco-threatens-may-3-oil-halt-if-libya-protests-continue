Libya ’s Arabian Gulf Oil Co. may
halt crude production if the government fails by May 3 to clear
protesters who have been blocking the entrance to the state-run
company’s headquarters in Benghazi for a week, an official said.  Agoco faces higher logistical costs, such as staff
relocation to temporary offices and communication with oil field
employees as a result of the protests, Abdul Jalil Mayuf,
manager of the company’s information department said.  “We could no longer bear this and deal with the delay,”
he said by telephone from Benghazi today. “If this is not dealt
with, then the consequences would be grave. It is unbelievable
that a company as big as Agoco remain hostage to a group of
people. The government should either deal with them by force or
find a solution.”  Protesters demanded jobs for unemployed youth and greater
transparency on how government money is spent. Mayuf also
complained about the protests last week, saying demonstrators
should address their action to the government rather than Agoco.  The company is currently producing 375,000 barrels of crude
a day, and is expected to reach its full capacity of about
425,000 barrels a day in mid-May, Mayuf said.  Libya last month pumped about 1.35 million barrels a day
nationwide, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, or about 84
percent of its pre-war output of 1.6 million barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
