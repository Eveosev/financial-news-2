The  International Monetary Fund  is
prepared to lend  Egypt  $3.2 billion at a reduced interest rate
of 1 percent, the Muslim Brotherhood’s now disqualified
presidential candidate said, the state-run al-Ahram reported.  Khairat el-Shater, the Brotherhood’s chief strategist who
was knocked out of the May race on electoral-law technicalities,
said the offer came when IMF officials met with his group during
a visit to Egypt earlier this month. He also said the U.S.
deputy secretary of state had agreed to back Islamic bonds
issued by Egypt abroad, the newspaper reported.  A call and text message for comment to the mobile phone of
Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed weren’t immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
