The heaviest and most numerous U.S.
pig population on record and rebounding Chinese output are
creating a surplus that is poised to halt a four-year rally in
prices.  U.S. farmers will raise 117.1 million  pigs  this year, the
most in at least a half century, as world pork output gains 2.7
percent to an all-time high of 104.4 million metric tons, U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates show. China may produce 690
million hogs, the most since at least 1976. Prices may drop 10
percent to 77.75 cents a pound in  Chicago  by Dec. 31, according
to the median of 10 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures doubled in the past 30 months, and surging pork
costs drove Chinese food-price inflation to 14.8 percent in
July, more than twice the average over the past decade, data
from the state-owned China Economic Information Network show.
U.S. retail bacon reached a record $4.84 a pound in June, a 34
percent gain in two years. Farmers responded by producing more,
and carcass weights reached a 10-year high in April, generating
a surplus of meat that will swell global stockpiles to the
largest in five years, the USDA estimates.  “There’s plenty of pork,” said John Nalivka, a former
USDA economist and the president of Sterling Marketing Inc., an
agricultural economic research and advisory company in  Vale ,
 Oregon . “We’re not running out of hogs.”  Below High  Prices advanced 1.8 percent this year to settle at 85.85
cents today on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, still 18 percent
below the 25-year high of $1.0435 reached in April 2011. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agriculture Index of eight commodities
fell 0.3 percent, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of
equities jumped 10 percent. Treasuries returned 0.2 percent, a
Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Hedge funds  and other speculators turned bearish on prices
in the week ended April 24, for the first time since September
2009, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. They
hold a net-short position of 772 futures and options, down from
a net-long position of 80,349 in October, the data show.  Global pork production will exceed demand by 577,000 tons
this year, the most since 1983, bringing stockpiles at the end
of the season to 815,000 tons, USDA  estimates  show. The
department raised its forecast for Chinese output by 320,000
tons to 51.6 million tons on April 17, implying a 4.2 percent
increase year-on-year, after a 3.1 percent decline in 2011.  China Shipments  While Chinese pork imports will drop 14 percent to 650,000
tons this year, shipments will still be the third-highest on
record, USDA data show. The decline in U.S. cargoes to the Asian
nation that drove February exports to a seven-month low will
most likely be temporary, said Brett Stuart, the co-founder of
Global AgriTrends, a Denver-based meat research company.  The U.S. will sell 822 million pounds (373,000 tons) to
 China  this year, compared with 816 million pounds in 2011, when
shipments doubled, Global AgriTrends estimates. China imported
146,475 tons of pork in the first quarter, more than twice the
amount a year earlier, customs data show.  The country will consume almost 52 million tons of pork
this year, the most since at least 1975, USDA data show. Demand
has been increasing by about 1 million tons a year over the past
decade, equal to an extra 11 million hogs, “a very big
challenge” to meet without imports, Stuart said.  Beef Alternative  U.S. demand may also accelerate as supplies of other meats
decline. Beef production will drop 4.4 percent this year after a
southern drought shrank the herd to its smallest since 1952, and
chicken output will decline 1.8 percent, the USDA estimates.
Retail ground-beef prices reached $3.016 a pound in March, the
highest since at least 1984, and chicken breasts rose to $2.385
a pound, the most since November 2010, Bureau of Labor
Statistics data show.  The U.S. reported its first case of  mad cow disease  in six
years on April 24, after a dairy cow in  California  was found
with the brain-wasting disease. It was the nation’s fourth
instance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the first since
2006. No meat entered the human food chain, the USDA said.  Cattle futures fell the most allowed by the CME before
rallying for the next three days.  Canada ,  Mexico ,  Japan  and
 South Korea , the four biggest buyers of U.S. beef, said they
won’t halt purchases, indicating no slump in beef sales or a
surge in demand for alternative meats. The respondents in the
Bloomberg survey on hog prices made few changes to their
estimates after the BSE case was announced.  Hog Herd  The U.S. hog herd may get bigger next year as feed costs
decline. Corn dropped 2.7 percent in Chicago this year on
prospects for U.S. farmers planting the most acres since 1937.
December futures, reflecting expectations for supply after the
U.S. harvest, are trading at an 18 percent discount to grain for
May delivery. Global production will jump 4.2 percent to a
record 900 million tons in the next crop year, the London-based
International Grains Council predicted April 2.  “It looks like feed costs are going to decline a great
deal in the fourth quarter,” said  Ron Plain , a livestock
economist at the  University of Missouri  in Columbia who has
studied the industry for three decades. “Farmers are likely to
respond to that by increasing the sow herd late this year to
give us more hogs in 2013, and therefore lower prices.”  U.S. hog farmers will be profitable for a third consecutive
year in 2012, encouraging them to expand, said  Mark Greenwood ,
who oversees $1.4 billion in loans and leases to the industry as
a vice president at AgStar Financial Services Inc. in Mankato,
 Minnesota . The average producer will earn about $8 to $12 per
hog this year, compared with $15 to $20 last year, he said.  Deli Meats  Commodity costs are “flattening out,” and pork prices
“are starting to come down,”  Marcel Smits , the chief executive
officer of  Sara Lee Corp. (SLE) , told analysts on a conference call
Feb. 2. The  Downers Grove , Illinois-based company makes Ball
Park frankfurters and deli meats.  The average U.S. hog  carcass  reached 212.56 pounds (96.4
kilograms) on April 12, the most in USDA data going back a
decade. Animals are getting heavier after first-quarter
temperatures were the highest on record, according to the
 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . If animals use
less energy to keep warm, they put on more weight.  The USDA is looking for more pork out of the domestic herd
because of “increased sow productivity,” the government said
on April 17. The average number of pigs saved per litter in the
three months ended Feb. 29 was 9.97, a record for the quarter,
government data show.  Slowing Demand  The gains are coming at a time when the USDA is forecasting
domestic consumption of 8.48 million tons, the second-lowest
level in the past decade. Wholesale-pork prices fell to 76.53
cents a pound on April 18, the lowest since December 2010, and
31 percent below the record of $1.1019 reached in August, USDA
data show. Retail-bacon prices dropped 5 percent from last
year’s record, government data show.  “Domestic demand has been underwhelming,” said Karl Skold, the president of Westside Economics, an Omaha, Nebraska-
based food consultant, and a former head of commodity
procurement at  ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG)  “We’ll see a little bit more
supply in the fourth quarter, and we’re not going to have quite
as rosy demand as the current futures suggest.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
