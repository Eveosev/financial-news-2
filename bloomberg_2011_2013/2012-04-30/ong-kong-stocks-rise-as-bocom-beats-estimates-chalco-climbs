Hong Kong stocks  rose, with the
 Hang Seng  closing at its highest in a month, on strong earnings
as Bank of Communications Ltd. led lenders higher after beating
estimates and China Coal Energy Company Ltd.’s profit increased.  Bank of Communications  advanced 3.6 percent. China Coal, a
unit of the mainland’s leading producer of the fuel, gained 4
percent. Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd., China’s
second-biggest electronics retailer, fell to the lowest level in
almost three years amid slowing economic growth and concern an
end to subsidies will affect earnings.  The Hang Seng Index rose 1.7 percent to 21,094.21 at the
close in  Hong Kong , the highest since March 19. Volume was 8.8
percent below the 30-day intraday average. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of mainland stocks advanced 1.6 percent to
11,081.  “At the company level, the reporting season has been quite
good,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1 billion
in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “This is
helping markets.”  Hong Kong’s benchmark index has climbed 14 percent this
year. Shares on the gauge traded at 10.6 times estimated
earnings, compared with a multiple of 13.4 on the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and 10.9 times on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today at 1,396.75. The gauge advanced 0.2 percent in  New
York  on April 27, capping its best weekly rally since March.  Of the 67 companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index that
reported quarterly earnings since April 10, 13 exceeded
expectations, while 26 missed analysts’ estimates, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Banking Stocks Climb  Bank of Communications  advanced 3.6 percent to HK$6, the
most since February, after it reported 15.9 billion yuan ($2.5
billion) in first-quarter net income, beating analysts’
estimates for a 15.5 billion yuan gain. The stock also rose
after being raised to “outperform” by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  Agricultural Bank of  China  Ltd., the world’s sixth-biggest
lender by market value, added 1.9 percent to HK$3.69 after its
43.5 billion yuan profit exceeded expectations on a 22 percent
jump in net interest income.  China Coal rallied 4 percent to HK$8.91 after profit rose
15 percent to 3 billion yuan in the first quarter, up from 2.6
billion yuan in the year-earlier period.  Gome Drops  Among stocks that declined, Gome slid 5.4 percent to
HK$1.40 after a state program that gave shoppers as much as 400
yuan to buy appliances expired.  Gome competitor Suning Appliance Co. reported a 15 percent
drop in first-quarter net income last week. China, the world’s
second-largest economy, pared the nation’s economic growth
target to 7.5 percent from an 8 percent goal in place since 2005.  “The heavy selling reflects investors’ concerns over an
economic slowdown,” said  Andrew Sullivan , principal trader at
Piper Jaffray. “We’ve seen a warning as its major rival
reported disappointing first-quarter earnings last week, and
generally no one is buying into white goods companies at the
moment.”  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  expiring this month gained
1.9 percent to 20,940. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  fell 0.1 percent
to 18.98, indicating options traders expect a swing of about 5.4
percent on the benchmark index during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
