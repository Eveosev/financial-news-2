Toscelik Profil Ve Sac Endustrisi
AS won an auction to buy  Zeljezara AD Niksic (ZEHK) , paying 15.1
million euros ($20 million) for the unprofitable Montenegrin
steel plant.  Toscelik, part of Tosyali Holding, bought the Niksic-based
mill after four previous auctions failed, Montenegro’s Economy
Minister Vladimir Kavaric said in a statement on the
government’s  website  today. Zeljezara’s court-appointed
receivership administration set the asking price at 15 million
euros in the latest auction, half of what it asked in January.  The steelworks was put into bankruptcy a year ago when a
workers union demanded overdue wages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
