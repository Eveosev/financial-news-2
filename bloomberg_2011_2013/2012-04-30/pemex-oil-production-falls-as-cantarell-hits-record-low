Petroleos Mexicanos , the world’s
third-largest oil producer, said crude production fell for a
fifth month after its aging Cantarell field posted the lowest
output in at least 22 years.  Daily production from the state-owned company, known as
Pemex, dropped 1 percent to 2.546 million barrels this month,
from 2.573 million a year earlier, according to a preliminary
production  report  from the  Mexico  City-based company today.
Cantarell’s output fell 14 percent from April 2011 to 400,000
barrels a day, the lowest since at least 1990, when the Energy
Ministry started to publish Pemex’s production.  Cantarell’s production has slid 74 percent since 2006 to
449,000 barrels a day last year, dragging down the country’s
daily output. Pemex has sought to stop declining output at
Cantarell, the world’s third-largest field when it was
discovered in 1976, by injecting natural gas and using other
recovery methods.  Pemex Chief Executive Officer  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  said
last month that gains from Cantarell would be the support to
boost Mexico’s annual production for the first time in eight
years.  “We foresee a stable and increasing Cantarell field,”
Suarez Coppel said in a March 6 interview.  Pemex officials didn’t immediately respond to phone calls
and e-mails requesting comment.  Saudi Aramco  and the National Iranian Oil Co. are the two
largest oil producers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
