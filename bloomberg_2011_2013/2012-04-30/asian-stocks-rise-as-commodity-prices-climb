Asian  stocks  rose, with a regional
index heading for its longest winning streak in three months, as
investors bet  Australia ’s central bank will cut  interest rates 
tomorrow, corporate earnings beat estimates and confidence among
South Korean manufacturers improved.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  advanced 1.1
percent on speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut
rates to bolster economic growth. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
biggest mining company, increased 1.9 percent in Sydney as
copper futures gained. Samsung Heavy Industries Co. jumped 5.8
percent in  Seoul  after the nation’s No. 2 shipbuilder posted
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  “In Australia, the consumer is really struggling,”  Kumar Palghat , managing director and founder of Kapstream Capital Pty
in Sydney, told Bloomberg Television. “I really think tomorrow
the RBA should cut 50 basis points. That will be a meaningful
number to kick-start the economy again.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index (MXAPJ)  climbed 1
percent to 441.53 as of 6:57 p.m. in Hong Kong, extending gains
for a fifth day, the longest run of gains since Jan. 23. More
than two shares rose for each that fell on the gauge. The
regional index is heading for a 0.5 percent advance this month
as earnings that beat analysts’ estimates from companies
including Samsung Electronics Co. overshadowed concern Europe
will struggle to contain its sovereign-debt crisis.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  increased 0.8 percent, the
highest close since August. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.7
percent after the nation’s home-building approvals climbed to
the highest in almost two years in March. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index gained 1.7 percent to its highest close since March 19.  Manufacturers’ Confidence  The Kospi Index added 0.3 percent after a report showed
South Korean manufacturers’ confidence rose to the highest level
in nine months. Markets in  Japan , Vietnam and mainland  China  are
closed for holidays.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The gauge advanced 0.2 percent in  New York  on
April 27, capping its best weekly rally since March.  Australian banks advanced on speculation the RBA will lower
its 4.25 percent cash-rate target at least 25 basis points
tomorrow, with a 34 percent chance of a reduction to 3.75
percent, swaps data compiled by Bloomberg show. There’s a 68
percent chance it will be 3.5 percent or lower by July.  ANZ Bank climbed 1.1 percent to A$23.91 in Sydney.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation’s biggest lender by
market value, added 0.7 percent to A$51.97.  Miners Rally  Raw-material producers advanced as copper futures in  London 
headed for a fifth day of gains. BHP increased 1.9 percent to
A$35.55 in Sydney. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-biggest
mining company, gained 1.4 percent to A$66.35. Jiangxi Copper
Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the metal, rose 1.1 percent to
HK$18.76 in  Hong Kong .  Samsung Heavy jumped 5.8 percent to 41,700 won after
posting first-quarter net income that exceeded analysts’
estimates by 56 percent.  Bank of Communications Co.  advanced 3.6
percent to HK$6 in Hong Kong after the Chinese lender reported
first-quarter profit of 15.9 billion yuan ($2.5 billion),
beating the average estimate of 15.4 billion yuan in a Bloomberg
survey.  “The reporting season has been quite good,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “This is helping markets.”  Of the 234 companies on the regional index that posted
quarterly profits since April 10, 93 surpassed expectations,
while 107 fell short, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that declined, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.,
which assembles Apple Inc.’s iPhone and iPad, tumbled 7 percent
to NT$92.40 in Taipei. The company slid after posting first-
quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates by 31 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan Index climbed 12 percent
this year through last week, lifting the value of shares on the
gauge to 11.9 times  estimated earnings  on average. That compares
with 13.4 times for the S&P 500 and 10.8 times for the Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
