Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to the
strongest level in almost eight months after global funds added
to holdings of local stocks on optimism exports will increase as
the  U.S. economy  recovers.  Government bonds  were steady.  International investors bought $119 million more Taiwanese
shares than they sold on April 30, taking net purchases for the
year to $3.9 billion, according to exchange data. The U.S.
Institute for Supply Management’s factory index climbed to 54.8
in April, exceeding the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey. The currency gained for a fifth day after official
data showed last week that the local economy expanded for a 10th
successive quarter in the three months through March.  “Funds are coming into Taiwan again,” said Eric Hsing, a
fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.
“Although Taiwan’s economy is still recovering, it’s still in
pretty good shape compared to the developed nations.”  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.3 percent to NT$29.136 against its
U.S. counterpart as of 9:28 a.m. local time, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.08, the strongest level since Sept.
8. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings traders use to price options, rose eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 4.08 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 was little changed at 0.996 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  slipped one basis
point to 0.499 percent, according to a weighted average compiled
by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.508 percent
on April 30, the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
