The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
declined, halting a four-month advance, after a report showed
that business activity expanded at the slowest pace since
November 2009 and Spain’s economy entered into a recession.  Bank of America Corp. ,  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Monsanto Co. (MON) 
retreated at least 1.7 percent.  Humana Inc. (HUM)  tumbled 8.1 percent
as profit at the provider of U.S.-backed Medicare insurance
missed analysts’ projections.  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  slumped 4.9 percent
amid a 44 percent decline in earnings. Barnes & Noble Inc.
soared a record 52 percent after  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said it plans
to invest $300 million in a venture with the bookstore chain.  The  S&P 500  lost 0.4 percent to 1,397.91 at 4 p.m. New York
time, extending its April decline to 0.7 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  fell 14.68 points, or 0.1 percent, to
13,213.63 today. The gauge rose less than 0.1 percent in April,
gaining for a  seventh month  in the longest winning streak since
2007. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges
today, or 8.9 percent below the three-month average.  “Europe is a chronic situation,” said  Russ Koesterich ,
the San Francisco-based global chief investment strategist for
the IShares unit of  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  His firm oversees $3.68
trillion as the largest asset manager. “Even under a best-case
scenario, where there’s no banking crisis, the reality is: it’s
going to be a very slow process. While you’ve got evidence that
the U.S. is recovering, the rebound will be uneven.”  Equities fell as the Institute for Supply Management-
Chicago Inc. said its  barometer  slid to 56.2 during the month,
lower than the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Consumer spending  in the U.S. rose in March. Spain
entered its second recession since 2009.  Earnings Season  Today’s decline came after the S&P 500 capped the biggest
weekly  gain  in more than a month. The measure was still up 11
percent in 2012 amid better-than-estimated economic and
corporate data. About  74 percent  of S&P 500 companies that
reported results since April 10 have beaten earnings
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The economic doldrums in Europe are casting a shadow over
any progress we’re making,” said  Jack Ablin , chief investment
officer of Harris Private Bank in Chicago, which oversees about
$60 billion. “We may not get a negative period for the market,
but it may just be a quiet one.”  Technology and industrial shares fell the most among 10 S&P
500 groups. A gauge of homebuilders in S&P indexes slid 1.6
percent after last week surging to the highest since  2008. (S15HOME)  Bank
of America fell 1.7 percent to $8.11. Caterpillar slipped 1.7
percent to $102.77. Monsanto dropped 2.1 percent to $76.18.  Humana Slumps  Humana lost 8.1 percent, the most since 2009, to $80.68.
 Net income  dropped 21 percent to $248 million, or $1.49 a share,
from $315 million, or $1.86, a year earlier. The per-share
result missed by 2 cents the $1.51 average of 9 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  NYSE Euronext slumped 4.9 percent to $25.75. European
regulators blocked NYSE Euronext from merging with Deutsche
Boerse AG in February, frustrating plans to mitigate a  slowdown 
in stock trading and boost earnings and sales through
cooperation on derivatives. Today’s report highlights the
challenges that spurred the takeover proposal, exacerbated by a
decline in equity volume across American exchanges to some of
the worst levels in a decade.  VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  slipped 12 percent to $47.64. The
largest maker of credit-card terminals was cut to sell from hold
by Deutsche Bank AG.  Barnes & Noble  Barnes & Noble (BKS)  soared 52 percent, the most in the Russell
2000 Index, to $20.75. The investment will give Microsoft about
18 percent of the newly formed company, which has yet to be
named. The companies will develop a Nook e-reader application
for Windows 8 and have also settled their patent litigation.  Merck & Co. jumped 2 percent, the biggest gain in the Dow,
to $39.24. The company’s patent for the cholesterol drugs Zetia
and Vytorin is valid and enforceable, a federal judge ruled
April 27 in a case against  Mylan Inc. (MYL) , which sought to sell
generic versions of the drugs before the patent expires.  Takeover news helped lift some companies today, limiting
the market’s losses.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  climbed the most in the  S&P
500 (SPXL1) , adding 20 percent to $49.29. The Philadelphia-based refiner
agreed to be acquired for $5.3 billion in shares and cash by
Energy Transfer Partners LP, which is adding oil transportation
and distribution assets.  Gen-Probe Inc. (GPRO)  surged 19 percent to $81.55.  Hologic Inc. (HOLX) , a
maker of diagnostic medical and surgical devices, agreed to buy
the company for about $3.7 billion in cash to expand its tests
for sexually transmitted diseases.  Exploring Sale  Warner Chilcott Plc (WCRX)  rallied 16 percent to $21.81. The maker
of dermatology and women’s health drugs said it is exploring a
sale of the company and is in talks with potential buyers.  Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST)  jumped as much as 28 percent after
the Wall Street Journal reported  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  is in talks to
buy the maker of energy drinks, then erased the gain after Coca-
Cola denied the report. Monster lost 0.8 percent to $65. Coca-
Cola slid 0.4 percent to $76.32, trimming a loss of as much as
0.9 percent.  Harman International Industries Inc. gained 4.9 percent to
$49.58. The maker of car audio systems reported third-quarter
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates and announced a record-
high $2 billion contract.  Analysts predict  U.S. shares will rise enough this year to
boost the S&P 500 to a record, even as Wall Street strategists
say the best is already over for American equities.  S&P 500 Projections  Individual price forecasts for stocks show the combined
projection for the gauge has risen to 1,569.74, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the
 October 2007 high  of 1,565.15. At the same time, strategists who
base their predictions on assessments of the economy say this
year’s rally represents all the gains investors will see.  Bullish forecasts are based on analysts’ expectations that
 S&P 500 earnings  will reach records every year through 2014 as
stimulus by the Federal Reserve props up the  U.S. economy . Bears
say Europe’s debt crisis won’t be contained and economic growth
will be insufficient to maintain gains.  Analysts are signaling that 13 straight quarters of higher-
than-expected earnings and record profits through 2014 will help
drive the gauge back to its all-time high. Earnings will jump 14
percent to $105.12 a share in 2012, according to analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The financial strength of corporate America is stronger
than people believe,” Jeffrey Schwarte, a money manager who
helps oversee about $258.2 billion in Des Moines, Iowa, at
Principal Global Investors, said in a telephone interview on
April 25. “We believe earnings ultimately matter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
