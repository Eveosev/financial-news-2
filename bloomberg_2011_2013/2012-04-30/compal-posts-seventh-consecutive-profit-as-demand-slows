Compal Electronics Inc. (2324) , the
world’s second-largest contract maker of notebooks, posted its
seventh consecutive decline in profit, missing estimates, as
demand for computers slows globally.  First-quarter  net income  dropped 47 percent to NT$1.87
billion ($63 million) from NT$3.5 billion a year earlier, the
Taipei-based company said in a  statement . The average of 10
 analysts estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of
NT$2.28 billion.  Competition from Apple Inc.’s iPad and more-powerful
smartphones have prompted consumers to spend less on computers,
resulting in global shipment growth slowing to 0.5 percent last
year from the 14 percent pace in the previous 12-month period.
New models, including high-end ultrabooks, and a new processor
from  Intel Corp . may help revenue climb this quarter.  Consolidated revenue  fell 5.7 percent from a year earlier
to NT$161.3 billion. That figure will rise to NT$183.4 billion
this quarter with net income of NT$3.1 billion, according to
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Compal  shares  added 1.5 percent to close at NT$33.6 today
in Taipei before the announcement. The stock has climbed 11
percent this year, compared with a 6.1 percent advance in the
benchmark Taiex index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
