Australia’s dollar plunged and its
bond yields sank to record levels after the country’s central
bank cut  interest rates  by more than economists forecast.  Government bonds  advanced, sending rates on 5-, 10 and  15-
year debt to all-time lows after the  Reserve Bank  of Australia
lowered its overnight cash rate target to 3.75 percent from 4.25
percent, the deepest cut in three years. The so-called Aussie
slid against all of its major peers as data today showed the
nation’s home prices declined and a manufacturing gauge declined
to a seven-month low.  “I was expecting a 25 basis-point cut at this meeting,”
said Derek Mumford, a director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a
currency risk management company. “You’d be worried they’re
cutting 50 basis points at this time and how aggressive they’re
going to be down the line. I think the Aussie could test parity
in the next three to six weeks.”  The Australian dollar dropped 1 percent to $1.0327 as of
4:46 p.m. in Sydney. It lost 1.1 percent to 82.33 yen. The
nation’s 10-year  bond yield  fell as much as 14 basis points to
3.534 percent. Five-year  rates  slid as low as 2.937 percent, 18
basis points less than yesterday’s close. The 15-year security,
the longest dated government bond, declined 14 basis points to
3.863 percent.  New Zealand ’s dollar weakened versus 15 of its 16 most-
traded counterparts, losing 0.5 percent to 81.45 U.S. cents and
0.6 percent to 64.95 yen.  Half-Point Cut  Only two of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
predicted the RBA’s decision to cut its benchmark by 50 basis
points. The other 27 forecast a quarter-point reduction.  The half-point cut was “judged to be necessary in order to
deliver the appropriate level of borrowing rates,” RBA Governor
 Glenn Stevens  said in a statement. In the next year or two,
“inflation will probably be lower than earlier expected” and
within the central bank’s target range of 2 percent to 3
percent, he said.  Data last month showed consumer price inflation slowed to
1.6 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the
slowest annual pace since the third quarter of 2009, and
compared with economists’ forecast of a 2.2 percent increase.  “The base scenario was for 25 basis points of interest-
rate reduction, so 50 was a bit of a surprise,” said Michiyoshi Kato, senior vice president of foreign-currency sales in  Tokyo 
at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., a unit of  Japan ’s second-largest
bank by assets.  Home Prices  An index measuring prices for established houses in eight
major Australian cities dropped 1.1 percent last quarter from
the previous three months, the government said today. A gauge of
the country’s factory output fell 5.6 points to 43.9 last month,
according to a survey by the Australian Industry Group and
PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Demand for the so-called Aussie and kiwi was also limited
amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is weighing on global growth.  Spain  will auction three- and five-year notes on May 3.
Yields on the nation’s 10-year bonds climbed above 6 percent
last month, stoking speculation the euro area’s fourth-largest
economy would follow Greece, Ireland and  Portugal  in seeking a
bailout. Spain’s economy entered its second recession since
2009, a government report showed yesterday.  Downside Risks  In  China , a purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.3 in
April from 53.1 a month earlier, the nation’s statistics bureau
and logistics federation said in a statement today. The median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a reading
of 53.6. Levels of 50 or more indicate expansion. China is
 Australia ’s biggest trading partner and New Zealand’s second
largest export market.  U.S. factory  orders  probably declined 1.7 percent in March
from the previous month, when it rose 1.3 percent, according to
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
Commerce Department is due to release the data tomorrow.  “Global growth is not exactly strong, and I think the risk
is still to the downside from Europe, U.S. and China,” said
Rochford’s Mumford.  -- With reporting by Hiroko Komiya in Tokyo. Editors: Rocky
