The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according
to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments added 1.5 basis points to 275.5
at 3 p.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 5.5
basis points to 650.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose 2.5 basis points to
140.5 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers was 0.5 basis point higher at 242.5 and
the subordinated index increased one to 401.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
