The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities declined 0.2 percent to 682.86 at 4:54 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
dropped 0.2 percent to 1,580.469.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the highest level in almost four weeks,
heading for a monthly gain, as signs of economic revival in the
U.S. and  Asia  bolstered the outlook for global crude demand.  Crude for June delivery was at $104.92 a barrel, down 1
cent, on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:16 p.m. Singapore
time. The contract advanced 0.4 percent to $104.93 on April 27,
the highest close since April 2. Prices are 1.8 percent higher
this month and up 6.2 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures in New York dropped after rising on
April 27 because of forecasts for colder-than-normal weather
that was expected to boost heating demand.  OIL PRODUCTS  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures was
at $92.86 a metric ton at 12:37 p.m.  Singapore  time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread , a measure of
processing profit, has shrunk 27 percent so far this month, the
most since a 53 percent loss in October.  Naphtha swaps for May were down $1 at $994 a ton, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. Prices are
headed for a second monthly decrease.  Gasoil, or diesel, swaps for May were unchanged after
rising to $132.85 a barrel, according to PVM. Prices are set for
the first monthly drop this year. Gasoil’s premium to Asian
marker Dubai crude fell 47 cents to $16.43 a barrel, PVM data
showed. The difference, also known as the crack spread, is
poised to widen for a second month.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold may climb for a fifth day for the best run since
January as concern that the European debt crisis is deepening
boosts haven demand. The precious metal is still set for the
longest run of monthly losses in 12 years.  Spot gold was little changed at $1,664.86 an ounce at 2
p.m. in Singapore, after gaining 1.5 percent in the final four
days of last week. Bullion remains poised for a third month of
losses, the longest losing streak since 2000, as the euro lost
0.8 percent against the dollar since the end of March.  June-delivery bullion was little changed at $1,665.10 an
ounce on the Comex in  New York . Holdings in exchange-traded
products, or ETPs, expanded for the first time in five days on
April 27 to 2,390.444 metric tons. China’s financial markets are
closed today and tomorrow.  Spot silver climbed 0.4 percent to $31.3925 an ounce. It’s
down 2.7 percent this month and set for a second monthly loss.
The metal in ETPs stood at 17,557.69 tons on April 27, unchanged
from the previous day and set for the biggest monthly drop since
October, according to data tracked by Bloomberg.  Cash platinum climbed 0.2 percent to $1,576.13 an ounce,
paring a second monthly decline. Exchange-traded product
holdings were at 42.4966 tons on April 27, level with the day
before and the least since Feb. 22. ETP holdings are headed for
the biggest monthly drop since December.  BASE METALS  Copper advanced for a fifth day, the longest rally since
August, as falling inventories fueled speculation that global
supplies will dwindle later this year.  The metal for delivery in three months gained as much as 1
percent to $8,495 per metric ton, the highest level since April
4. The last time prices increased five straight days was August
31. Copper is 0.6 higher this month after a 0.6 percent drop in
March. The July-delivery contract today rose 0.9 percent to
$3.8585 a pound on the Comex in New York. Markets in  China  are
closed for a holiday today.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn climbed for a third day on speculation that the
biggest one-day sale of the grain by U.S. exporters since 1994
may drain stockpiles in the world’s largest grower and shipper.
Wheat fell.  July-delivery corn rose as much as 1 percent to $6.315 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, extending a 3.7 percent
gain last week and reaching the highest for the most-active
contract since April 13. It traded at $6.28 at 3:16 p.m.
Singapore time, paring the monthly loss to 2.5 percent.  Wheat for July delivery dropped 0.4 percent to $6.475 a
bushel, taking the monthly loss for the most-active contract to
2 percent. Soybeans for delivery in July was little changed at
$14.9475 a bushel. The oilseed, up 6.5 percent in April, is set
for a third monthly gain.  Palm oil  declined, trimming a third monthly gain, on
speculation that production in  Malaysia , the second-largest
supplier, may have increased in April after a seasonally low-
output period.  The July-delivery contract fell as much as 0.4 percent to
3,490 ringgit ($1,151) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, and ended the morning session at 3,501 ringgit in
 Kuala Lumpur . Futures are poised for a 2 percent gain this
month. Grain markets: NI GRMKTS  To contact the reporter on this story:
