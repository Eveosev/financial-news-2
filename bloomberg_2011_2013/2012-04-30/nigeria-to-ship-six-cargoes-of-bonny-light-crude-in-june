Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to ship six cargoes of benchmark Bonny Light
crude in June after two lots for loading in May were deferred,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The schedule comprises three cargoes of 1 million barrels
and three 950,000-barrel lots, the plan showed. Exports in May
were reduced to six consignments totaling 5.7 million barrels
after two shipments were delayed to June, according to a revised
loading schedule.  The country will also export six cargoes totaling 162,000
barrels a day of Forcados crude, down from 190,452 barrels a day
in May, a separate plan showed. Loadings of Okwori will be two
650,000-barrel cargoes in June, including one deferred from May,
according to another schedule.  The West African nation will also export three EA cargoes
and three Amenam shipments, the plans showed.  The schedules of Pennington and Akpo are still not
available. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
