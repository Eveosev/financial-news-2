South African credit growth
accelerated at the fastest pace in more than three years in
March as the central bank left borrowing costs unchanged at a
30-year low, boosting lending in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  Borrowing by households and businesses rose 9.2 percent, up
from 7.9 percent in February, the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank 
said on its website today. The median  estimate  in a Bloomberg
survey of 11 economists was for credit to expand 8.6 percent.  The Reserve Bank has kept the repurchase rate at 5.5
percent since November 2010 to support economic growth
threatened by a debt crisis in  Europe , a key trading partner.
While spending is recovering, consumers are facing rising costs
from gasoline prices, giving the central bank room to keep its
key rate unchanged.  “Things are recovering, but they aren’t going fast
enough,”  Colen Garrow , chief economist for Brait SA Ltd., said
in a telephone interview from Johannesburg. The data “argues
very much for leaving rates on hold.”  The rand was at 7.7496 per dollar at 11:44 a.m. in
Johannesburg, little changed from 7.74 before the data was
released. The yield on the bond due in 2015 dropped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.48 percent.  Inflation slowed to 6 percent in March, the top end of the
Reserve Bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range and the
slowest pace since September, the statistics agency said on
April 18. The inflation rate will peak at 6.5 percent this
quarter and fall into the target band by the end of the year,
Governor Gill Marcus said on March 29.  Expenditure in the economy expanded 5.1 percent in the
fourth quarter, the fastest pace in more than a year, according
to the central bank. Consumers account for two-thirds of
spending in  South Africa .  The broad M3 measure of  money supply  rose 6.7 percent in
March from a year earlier, compared with 5.9 percent in
February, the central bank said. The median  estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey was 6.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
