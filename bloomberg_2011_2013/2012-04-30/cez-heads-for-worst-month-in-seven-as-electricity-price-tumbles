CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility
in the Czech Republic, headed for its steepest monthly retreat
since September as Europeâ€™s economic slowdown sent the price of
electricity to near an all-time low.  The stock lost 4.8 percent this month, adding to a 1.1
percent drop in March. CEZ gained 0.3 percent today to 759.9
koruna by 1:53 p.m. in Prague after three days of declines. The
 PX (PX)  index rose 0.2 percent, paring April losses to 3.7 percent.  Power for next-year delivery in Germany, where CEZ exports
part of its output, fell 0.3 percent today to 50.45 euros per
megawatt-hour, taking its decline this month to 2.8 percent. The
contract traded 0.3 euros shy of its record-low 50.15 reached on
Jan. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
