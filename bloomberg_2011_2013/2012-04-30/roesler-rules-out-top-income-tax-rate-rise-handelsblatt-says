Germany ’s Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said there will be no increased top income tax rate as
long as his Free Democratic party is a member of the government
coalition,  Handelsblatt  reported today, citing an interview.  While the FDP’s goal of Germany reaching a balanced budget
by 2014 is “ambitious,” it is “feasible,” Roesler said,
according to the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
