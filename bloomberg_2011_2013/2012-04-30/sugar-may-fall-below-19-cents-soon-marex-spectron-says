The price of raw sugar traded in
 New York  may fall below 19 cents a pound “very soon,”
prompting processors in top producer  Brazil  to make ethanol
rather than the sweetener, Marex Spectron Group said.  Sugar has fallen 8.4 percent on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York this year, as supplies outpace demand by 6 million metric
tons, up from a previous forecast of 5.2 million tons, according
to the  International Sugar Organization  in London. The price was
at 21.34 cents a pound by 6:28 a.m. Below 19 cents a pound,
millers in Brazil would favor production of the biofuel, Marex
Spectron said, referring to the variety used in flex fuel cars.  “Logically, sugar prices have to go down below that level
very soon, before the crop gets into full swing,” Paul Bannister, head of sugar brokerage at the company in  London ,
wrote in a report e-mailed today.  Sugar prices may need to go “well below” 19 cents and
stay at such levels “for a major part of the harvest” to
trigger millers to switch to maximum ethanol production, he
said. The harvest in Brazil, which usually begins in April, is
set to start on May 1, according to ICAP do Brasil Ctvm. Millers
there make both ethanol and sugar from raw material sugar cane.  “Even if most mills make the maximum of ethanol and
minimum of sugar, there will almost certainly still be a
reasonable sugar surplus,” Bannister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
