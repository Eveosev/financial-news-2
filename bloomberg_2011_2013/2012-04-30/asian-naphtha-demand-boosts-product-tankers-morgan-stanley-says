Strengthening naphtha demand from
Asian petrochemical plants is boosting charter rates for product
tankers hauling the feedstock, Morgan Stanley analyst Fotis Giannakoulis said in a report.  Long-Range 1 vessels shipping the cargo to Asia from the
 Middle East  are earning almost $14,000 a day compared with
$5,214 at the end of March, according to data from  New York 
based shipbroker Poten & Partners.  The ships may also start making longer voyages should
European oil refineries maintain output cuts as that could spur
an increase in diesel cargoes from Russia, Giannakoulis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
