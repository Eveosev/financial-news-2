South Africa  imported 3.37 billion
rand ($435 million) of crude oil from Iran in March, nearly
doubling its purchases from the Middle Eastern nation in the
same period last year, according to the country’s tax authority.  South African crude imports totaled 11 billion rand in
March, with 30% of shipments coming from Iran, the Pretoria-
based  South African Revenue Service  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Nigeria was the biggest supplier in the month
with 40 percent.  Saudi Arabia  accounted for 22 percent and the
rest came from Angola.  South Africa imported no crude from Iran in January, and
imports totaled 2.8 billion rand in February. Imports amounted
to 1.73 billion rand in March last year.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  signed a law on Dec. 31 that
denies foreign banks that do business with the  Central Bank  of
Iran access to that country’s financial system. The U.S. may
impose penalties should a country not make “significant”
reductions in Iranian crude oil purchases in the first half of
this year.  Petroliam Nasional Bhd.’s Engen unit, the biggest South
African importer of Iranian crude, said April 4 it suspended
imports of oil from the Middle Eastern nation amid economic
sanctions by the U.S. and the European Union. Engen will shut
its refinery, the nation’s second-biggest, from May 6 to 26, the
Department of Energy said last week.  Africa’s biggest economy imported 27 billion rand of crude
from  Iran  last year, comprising 26 percent of total oil imports,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
