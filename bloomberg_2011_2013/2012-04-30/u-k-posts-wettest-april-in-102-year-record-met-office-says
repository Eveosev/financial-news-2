The U.K., suffering from limits on
water use because of a drought lasting 22 months, had its
wettest April since at least 1910, the  Met Office  said.  With more rain forecast tonight, the U.K. has had 121.8
millimeters (4.8 inches) this month, beating the prior record of
120.3 millimeters in 2000 and compared with an average for April
of 69.6 millimeters, the state forecaster said in a  statement .  “Further rain is to come overnight tonight as outbreaks of
heavy and possibly thundery rain affect southern  England  and
 Wales ,” the Met Office said today in the statement.  Rain has led to 188 flood warnings and alerts across Wales
and England, including for the Thames river west of London and
around the city of Oxford, the  Environment Agency  said.  The wet month follows the fifth driest March on record, the
Met Office said. April has also been cooler on average than
March for the first time since 1998, it said. Figures to April
25 show the mean temperature this month has been 6.1 degrees
Celsius (43 degrees Fahrenheit), after March’s 7.7 degrees.  Kemble Water Holdings Ltd.’s Thames Water unit, the U.K.’s
largest water company serving 8.8 million homes and businesses
in  London , joined six other utilities by imposing restrictions
on consumption, from April 5. Hose-pipe bans limit the use of
garden hoses to water yards, wash cars, fill pools, ponds and
fountains, and clean windows, walls and patios.  Liscombe in Somerset has had the most rainfall this month
with 273.8 millimeters, more than three times the average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
