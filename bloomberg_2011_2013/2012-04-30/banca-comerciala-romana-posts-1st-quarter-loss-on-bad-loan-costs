Banca Comerciala Romana SA,
 Romania ’s largest bank by assets, said it incurred a loss in the
first quarter as bad-loan costs almost doubled while net
interest income fell.  BCR had a loss of 307.8 million lei ($93 million) compared
with a profit of 76.1 million lei in the same period of last
year, the Bucharest-based bank said today in an e-mailed
statement. Net-interest income, or the difference between money
paid on deposits and earnings on loans, dropped 12.6 percent to
750.4 million lei from 859 million on lower demand for loans and
falling interest rates.  BCR is majority-owned by  Austria ’s  Erste Group Bank AG. (EBS)   Romanian banks, which recorded a cumulative loss of about
100 million euros ($133 million) in 2011, the second consecutive
year of losses, have been struggling since 2009 to cut rising
bad-loan costs as demand for new credits remains weak following
a slow economic recovery. The country will probably enter a new
technical recession in the first quarter, according to the
outgoing Finance Minister Bogdan Dragoi.  Provisions for bad loans almost doubled to 933.7 million
lei from 457.4 million as Romanian companies and households face
an economic slowdown, the bank said.  Bad loans stood at 22.4 percent of lending in the first
quarter. Most new bad loans came from businesses in the first
quarter as some large companies defaulted again, while small
enterprises are still facing high liquidity constraints, BCR
said.  Total assets dropped 1.6 percent to 75.5 billion lei, the
bank said. BCR’s solvency ratio stood at 12.3 percent, more than
the 10 percent requested by the Romanian Central Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
