The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose for a second day, gaining 0.4 percent to 938.7 at the close
of trading in Prague, paring the monthly decline to 3.5 percent.
The benchmark has advanced 3 percent so far this year.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names. The
Prague bourse is closed tomorrow for a public holiday.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility, rose
0.2 percent to 759.8 koruna, trimming its monthly decline to 4.9
percent, the steepest since September. Electricity for next-year
delivery in  Germany , where CEZ exports part of its output, slid
0.2 percent to 50.50 euros per megawatt-hour, 0.35 euro shy of
the contract’s record-low 50.15 euros reached on Jan. 16.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   jumped as much as 1.9 percent
after the Austrian lender published a first-quarter profit that
rose more than analysts expected. The stock pared the rally to
0.5 percent at 428 koruna as the bank lowered its forecast for
operating earnings, citing loan losses in Hungary and Romania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
