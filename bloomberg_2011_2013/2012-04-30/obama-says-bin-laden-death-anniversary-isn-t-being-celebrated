President  Barack Obama  denied his
administration is celebrating the anniversary of the killing of
al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, saying Americans “rightly
remember” what the nation accomplished with his death.  “I hardly think that you’ve seen any excessive celebration
taking place,” Obama said in response to a question at a White
House news conference today.  The one-year anniversary of bin Laden’s death at the hands
of U.S. special operations forces in Pakistan should be a time
for “some reflection,” he said.  Republicans, including presidential candidate  Mitt Romney ,
have accused Obama of using the anniversary for political
purposes in the election campaign. Vice President  Joe Biden  last
week said the slogan for Obama’s first term could be “ Osama bin
Laden  is dead, and General Motors is alive.” The campaign also
has created an advertisement questioning whether Romney would
have given the order to kill bin Laden.  Romney today said he “of course” would have given the go-
ahead for the raid on bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
