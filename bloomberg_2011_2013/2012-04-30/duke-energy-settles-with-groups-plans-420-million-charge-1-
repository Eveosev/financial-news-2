Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , the owner of
electric utilities in five states, said it settled with groups
over costs to Indiana consumers for a coal plant it’s building
in the state. The cost will reduce first-quarter results by 20
cents.  The settlement limits to $2.6 billion the amount customers
will pay for the $3.3 billion plant, Duke said today in a
statement. Parties to the settlement include Indiana’s Office of
Utility Consumer Counselor and others who accused Duke of fraud,
concealment and mismanagement of the project, Angeline
Protogere, a Duke spokeswoman, said today in an interview.  Settlement costs of $420 million will reduce first-quarter
profit by 20 cents a share, Protogere said. The agreement is
subject to approval by  Indiana ’s utility regulators.  The 620-megawatt plant near Edwardsport, Indiana, will
convert coal into a gas before burning it, a technology Duke and
Indiana officials have said may reduce the cost of capturing
carbon dioxide, blamed for global warming. Duke had estimated
the plant would cost $1.99 billion in 2006, according to the
Consumer Counselor’s website.  Operations will begin in the second half of 2012, Duke said
today.  The announcement was made after regular trading ended in
New York. Duke, based in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , was
unchanged at $21.43 today in New York. The company is scheduled
to report first-quarter financial results May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
