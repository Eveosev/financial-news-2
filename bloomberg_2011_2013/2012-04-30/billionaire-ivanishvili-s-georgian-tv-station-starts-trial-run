A Georgian satellite television
channel owned by the wife of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili
begins broadcasting today, General Director Kakha Beqauri said.  The Tbilisi-based station, Channel 9, owned by Ekaterine
Khvedelidze, will go on air at 9 p.m. local time for a “trial
run,” Beqauri said by telephone. He said it’s “hard to say”
how much Ivanishvili has invested in the project as equipment is
still arriving.  Ivanishvili, a critic of President Mikheil Saakashvili,
said on April 5 that he wants to become  Georgia ’s next prime
minister. He created an opposition political party on April 21
called Georgian Dream - Democratic Georgia to contest a
parliamentary election scheduled for October.  Ivanishvili, a Rossiiskiy Kredit Bank board member whose
wealth Forbes magazine  estimates  at $6.4 billion, was stripped
of Georgian citizenship last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
