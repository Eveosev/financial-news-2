Harman International Industries
Inc. (HAR)  rose the most in four months after the maker of car audio
systems reported third-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’
estimates and announced a record $2 billion contract.  The  shares  gained 4.9 percent to $49.58 at the close in
 New York  for their biggest daily increase since Dec. 20. They
have advanced 30 percent this year after falling 18 percent
during all of 2011.  Harman posted quarterly profit of 74 cents a share
excluding a tax-related gain and costs for restructuring,
beating the 67-cent average of three estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The contract is from a “luxury European automaker”
for systems that provide in-car information and entertainment,
Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal said in an interview,
without identifying that company.  The value to  Stamford , Connecticut-based Harman may exceed
$3 billion as more consumers add in-dash navigation systems and
equipment to link smartphones with vehicles, Paliwal said.  Net income in the quarter that ended March 31 more
than quadrupled to $172.7 million, or $2.38 a share, from
$36.6 million, or 51 cents, a year earlier, Harman said. Revenue
rose 16 percent to $1.1 billion, helped by a 15 percent gain in
sales of so-called infotainment systems, which connect vehicles
to the Internet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
