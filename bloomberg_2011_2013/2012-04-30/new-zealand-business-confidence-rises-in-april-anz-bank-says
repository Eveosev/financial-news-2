New Zealand business confidence
rose to an eight-month high in April, while a second gauge of
sales and profits declined, according to a survey by ANZ
National Bank Ltd.  A net 35.8 percent of companies expect the economy will
improve over the next 12 months, up from 33.8 percent in March
and the highest since July, according to the survey released in
Wellington today.  A measure of expectations for companiesâ€™ own sales and
earnings declined to 36.1 percent from 38.8 percent in
March. The net figure subtracts the number of pessimists from
the number of optimists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
