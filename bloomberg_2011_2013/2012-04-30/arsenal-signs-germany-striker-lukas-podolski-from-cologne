Arsenal signed German national team
striker  Lukas Podolski  for an undisclosed fee from Cologne.  The German club announced the sale today on its website,
without giving financial details.  The 26-year-old’s contract with Cologne expired after next
season. He’s scored a career-high 18 goals this season for the
club, which he joined as a 10-year-old. He left to join Bayern
Munich for three years, and returned in 2009.  Podolski has been linked with Arsenal since January, when
the  Daily Mirror  reported that Cologne was willing to sell him
for 12.5 million pounds ($20 million).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
