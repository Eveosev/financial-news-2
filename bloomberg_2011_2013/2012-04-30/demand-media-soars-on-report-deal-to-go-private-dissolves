Demand Media Inc. (DMD) , operator of
eHow.com and domain-name business eNom.com, rose to the highest
price in seven months after AllThingsD said the company had
discussed with  Thomas H. Lee Partners  a $1.2 billion deal to go
private that fell apart.  Demand Media soared 15 percent to $8.31 in New York, the
highest closing price since Sept. 27. The  Santa Monica ,
California-based company has gained 25 percent this year.  Demand Media would have been worth twice its April 27
market valuation of $608 million, according to the report. The
company may see large gains in its domain-name registration
business after an expansion of potential website addresses
announced by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names &
Numbers, said Douglas Arthur, an  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  analyst
in New York.  “Private-equity firms have been very active in that
business,” said Arthur, who lowered his  rating  to the
equivalent of hold from the equivalent of buy, based on Thomas
H. Lee Partners reported bid of around $11 a share. Arthur
pegged a target price of $9.  AllThingsD , which didn’t identify its sources, said the
deal dissolved over complications related to financing and
executive retention.  Demand Media went public in January 2011 by selling 8.9
million shares at $17 apiece.  Kristin Moore, a Demand Media spokeswoman, declined to
comment in an e-mail, citing a quiet period ahead of the
company’s first-quarter earnings report due May 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
