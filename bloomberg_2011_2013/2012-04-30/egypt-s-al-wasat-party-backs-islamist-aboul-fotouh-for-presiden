Egypt ’s Al Wasat Party, a group
founded by a former Muslim Brotherhood official, said it will
back Islamist candidate Abdel Moneim Aboul-Fotouh for president.  Aboul-Fotouh, himself a former Brotherhood official,
received 63 percent of the party’s vote, followed by another
Islamist candidate, Mohamed Selim El-Awwa, Al Wasat said in a
statement on its website. The Salafist Nour party, which has the
second-most seats in parliament after the Brotherhood’s Freedom
and Justice Party, also backed Aboul-Fotouh.  The Freedom and Justice Party has nominated its leader,
Mohamed Mursi, to run in next month’s election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
