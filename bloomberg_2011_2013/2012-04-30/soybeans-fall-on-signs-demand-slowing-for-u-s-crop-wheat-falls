Soybeans fell for the first time in
a week on signs that the highest prices since July 2008 may curb
demand. Wheat also fell, as timely Midwest rains boosted
prospects for U.S. crops.  A total of 752 soybean contracts covering a total of 3.76
million bushels were delivered on the first day allowed for the
expiring May contract on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, a sign that
traders preferred cash to holding soybeans. Before today, prices
jumped 24 percent this year. As of April 24,  hedge funds  had
boosted  bets  on higher prices to a record, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data show.  “The deliveries were a surprise for the market because
none were expected,” said Greg Grow, the director of
Agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
“There’s some fund liquidation today.”  Soybean futures for July delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$14.92 a bushel at 10:31 a.m. on the CBOT, after dropping as
much as 0.8 percent. On April 27, the price reached $15.0675,
the highest since July 2008, after hot, dry weather reduced
production in  South America  and boosted demand for U.S. supply.  Wheat prices fell as rain recharged soil moisture for
maturing winter crops in the southern Great Plains, Grow said.  Some fields received as much as 4 inches (10.2 centimeters)
of rain in the past three days, and about 85 percent of the
Midwest got some moisture, the  Commodity Weather Group LLC  said
in a report. Winter wheat in the Great Plains will benefit from
general coverage of 0.5 inch to 2 inches of rain and more
expected in the next five days, the Bethesda, Maryland-based
private forecaster said.  Wheat futures for July delivery declined 0.1 percent to
$6.495 a bushel in Chicago.  The U.S. soybean crop was valued at $35.8 billion last
year, the second-largest behind corn, government figures show.
Wheat is the fourth-biggest crop, behind hay, with a value of
$14.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
