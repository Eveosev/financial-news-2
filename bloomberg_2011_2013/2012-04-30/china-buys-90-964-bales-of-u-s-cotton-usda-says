China resumed buying U.S. upland
cotton during the week ended April 19, after canceling purchases
in the three previous weeks, Department of Agriculture data
show.  China  bought 90,964 running bales of upland cotton for
delivery before July 31, making up 63 percent of the 144,805
bales sold to all foreign buyers during the week, the USDA wrote
in a report on its website April 26. In the previous three
weeks, cancellations resulted in a net reduction in Chinese
purchases of 188,667 bales for delivery during the marketing
year. A running bale weighs 500 pounds (227 kilograms).  Upland 
is the most common type of cotton grown in the U.S.  The U.S. has exported 3.97 million bales of upland cotton
to China this marketing year, 18 percent more than at the same
time a year earlier, according to the USDA.  China  has bought
about 191,946 bales for delivery after July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
