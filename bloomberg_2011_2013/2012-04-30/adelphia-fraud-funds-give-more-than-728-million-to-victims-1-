More than $728 million forfeited in
connection with the criminal prosecutions of Adelphia
Communications Corp. founder  John Rigas , and his son Timothy, is
being paid to victims, prosecutors said.  It is the largest single distribution of forfeited assets
to victims in the Department of Justice’s history,  Manhattan 
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said today in a statement.  Adelphia, once the fifth-biggest U.S. cable company, and
the Rigases agreed in 2005 to pay $715 million to settle fraud
allegations. The forfeiture agreement with the Rigases and
Adelphia was intended to divest them of their fraud proceeds and
to compensate victims, the U.S. said. The payments took more
than five years to be made.  John Rigas and his son were first charged by the office in
2002 and later found guilty of conspiracy,  securities fraud  and
bank fraud. Both are in the Allenwood Federal Correctional
Institution, a low-security facility located in White Deer,
 Pennsylvania .  Adelphia, which filed bankruptcy in 2002, sold its assets
to Time Warner Inc. and Comcast Corp. for $17.6 billion in 2006.  In 2007, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office said that
$530 million in cash and Time Warner Cable Inc. stock had been
received, and the rest was expected to be paid.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Rigas, 02-CR-1236, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
