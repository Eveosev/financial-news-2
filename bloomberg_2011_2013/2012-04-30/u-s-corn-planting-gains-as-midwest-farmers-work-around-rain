(Corrects week ago planting estimate in eighth paragraph.
This story was first published April 30.)  U.S. farmers worked around Midwest
rain last week to increase corn planting, boosting expectations
that they will sow the most acres since 1937 and produce a
bigger harvest than last year’s drought-damaged crop.  About 53 percent of the corn crop was planted as of
yesterday, up from 28 percent a week earlier and 12 percent a
year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
 report . The average for the previous five years is 27 percent.
The percentage planted is second only to the record for the 17th
week of the year of 68 percent in 2010.  An estimated 15 percent of the plants had emerged from the
ground, compared with 4 percent a year earlier, the USDA said.
The average emergence for the prior five years was 6 percent.  “Overall, corn planting progress is very fast, and warmer
temperatures this week will aid emergence,” Bill Gentry, a
farmer and a broker at  Risk Management Commodities Inc.  in
Lafayette,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview before the
report. “There are a number of areas with dry subsoil that will
need regular rains throughout the growing season to reach full
yield potential.”  The report was issued after the close of trading on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade, where corn futures for July delivery
rose 1.4 percent to settle at $6.3425 a bushel. The most-active
contract dropped 1.5 percent this month on speculation that
rapid U.S. planting will boost yields.  Farmers are expected to increase corn sowing by 4.3 percent
to 95.864 million acres this year, the most in 75 years, the
USDA said on March 30, after surveying growers.  Soybean Planting Rises  About 12 percent of the soybean crop was planted, compared
with 6 percent a week ago and the previous five-year average of
5 percent, the USDA said.  About 74 percent of the spring-wheat  crop  was seeded as of
yesterday, up from 57 percent a week earlier, the department
said. The average for the date for the previous five years is 32
percent. Plant emergence rose to 30 percent from 18 percent a
week earlier and 8 percent on average the prior five years, the
agency said.  The winter-wheat crop was in better shape than a year
earlier, as above-normal rains in parts of the southern Great
Plains and Midwest boosted crop conditions, USDA said.  An estimated 64 percent of the crop was in good or
excellent  condition , compared with 63 percent a week earlier,
the USDA said. During the same week last year, 34 percent had
the top ratings.  Cotton planting  was 26 percent completed, compared with 18
percent a week earlier and 19 percent on average the prior five
years, the USDA said. Rice  planting  in the top six producing
states was 72 percent completed, up from 65 percent a week
earlier and 56 percent on average from 2007-2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
