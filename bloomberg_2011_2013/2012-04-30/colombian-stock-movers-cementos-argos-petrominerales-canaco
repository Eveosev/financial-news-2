The following companies had unusual

percent for the month. The  Colcap Index (COLCAP)  increased 0.9 percent to
1,785.66, extending its April gain to 2.4 percent. The IGBC

that operates in the Andean region, advanced 2.8 percent to
25,700 pesos, paring its drop in April to 23 percent, the worst
performance on the IGBC. The company’s Canadian-traded shares
were raised to market perform from underperform at Raymond James

overaggressive in correcting for exploration-related news,”
they wrote. “Investors may now be discounting a lower
probability of exploration success than we are.”  Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS)  , the country’s biggest
cement maker, fell 0.8 percent to 12,200 pesos.  Colombia ’s
financial regulator approved Cementos Argos’s spinoff of assets
that aren’t related to cement production, including portfolio
investments, real estate and port assets, to owner Inversiones

about the asset spinoff’s effect on the price of the shares is a
source of risk for investors,” Valores Bancolombia SA analyst
Diego Buitrago wrote in a research note today.  Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA)  , Colombia’s largest food
company, gained 0.1 percent to 21,620 pesos. Nutresa said first-
