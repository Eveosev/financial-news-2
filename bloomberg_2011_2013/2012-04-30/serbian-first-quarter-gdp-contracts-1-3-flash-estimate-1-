Serbia ’s economy contracted 1.3
percent in the first quarter of the year as bad weather in the
early months of the year hurt economic activity, according to a
flash estimate issued by the statistics office in Belgrade.  The decline in economic output in the first three months of
2012 compares with the central bank’s estimate of a 1.5 percent
GDP contraction. The  International Monetary Fund  sees Serbia’s
economy expanding by 0.5 percent in 2012, compared with full-
year growth of 1.6 percent last year.  The office also revised figures for the third and fourth
quarters of 2011 to 0.6 percent each, from 0.7 percent and 0.4
percent respectively.  Serbia is trying to avoid a second recession in three years
as the nation prepares to vote for a new president, parliament
and local governments on May 6.  Economic growth this year will largely be driven by
consumption, rather than net exports or investments, according
to central bank’s April  report . The central bank sees net
foreign investments declining to 400 million euros ($528.5
million) this year from 1.8 billion euros in 2011.  The central bank has urged policymakers to lower the  budget
deficit  and limit public debt to avoid further weakening of the
dinar and give the central bank room to reduce  interest rates 
and spur economic recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
