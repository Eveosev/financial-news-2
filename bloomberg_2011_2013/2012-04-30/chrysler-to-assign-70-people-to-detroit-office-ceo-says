Chrysler Group LLC, the automaker
controlled by  Fiat SpA (F) , is leasing offices in downtown Detroit
and will assign about 70 people there, Chief Executive Officer
 Sergio Marchionne  said.  Most of the employees involved have been stationed at the
company’s Auburn Hills, Michigan, headquarters, and will
relocate around mid-year. As part of the leasing agreement, the
city’s Dime Building will be renamed Chrysler House, the CEO
said. Chrysler is leasing about 33,000 square feet (3,066 square
meters) of space.  Chrysler’s first-quarter net income more than quadrupled as
car models such as the 200 and 300 sedans helped capture the
industry’s biggest U.S. market-share gain. Profit climbed to
$473 million from $116 million a year earlier, the Auburn Hills,
Michigan-based company said in an April 26 statement.  Sales increased 25 percent to $16.4 billion as the company
tapped into Detroit’s comeback with a Super Bowl television ad
featuring actor and director  Clint Eastwood . Chrysler has
forecast that net income will rise to about $1.5 billion this
year, buoying results for its Turin, Italy-based majority owner
as  Europe ’s debt crisis depresses sales in its home region.  Chrysler’s U.S. deliveries of passenger cars surged 89
percent this year through March from a year earlier, with the
200 and 300 sedans providing the biggest gains, according to
researcher Autodata Corp. in  Woodcliff Lake ,  New Jersey .  Chrysler said the most recent quarter was the most
profitable since 1998’s third quarter. The company didn’t report
results from late 1998 to 2007, when  Daimler AG (DAI)  owned Chrysler,
or when Cerberus Capital Management LP controlled it through
mid-2009.  Marchionne, 59, is chief executive officer of both Chrysler
and Fiat and plans to merge the two companies and boost sales to
more than 100 billion euros ($132 billion) by 2014. Fiat boosted
its ownership stake of Chrysler to 58.5 percent in January. He
reiterated last week that the company is unlikely to do an
initial public offering this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
