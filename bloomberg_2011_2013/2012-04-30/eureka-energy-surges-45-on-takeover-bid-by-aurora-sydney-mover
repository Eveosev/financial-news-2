Eureka Energy Ltd. (EKA) , an Australian
energy company with shale assets in  Texas , surged as much as 45
percent in Sydney to the highest in more than five years,
surpassing a takeover offer from  Aurora Oil & Gas Ltd. (AUT)   The stock climbed to 48 Australian cents -- its highest
since Dec. 21, 2006 -- and was up 41 percent at 46.50 cents at
11:21 a.m. local time. Aurora, an Australian rival focused on
exploration in Texas, fell 0.5 percent to A$4.10 while the
S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.6 percent.  Aurora offered 45 Australian cents a share in cash for the
shares of Eureka it doesn’t already own, 36 percent more than
its closing price of 33 cents on April 27, the Perth-based
company said today in a statement. Aurora currently holds 2.79
percent of Eureka.  The A$104 million ($109 million) acquisition would give
Aurora access to Eureka’s three assets with a combined 6,742
acres in the Eagle Ford shale region, including a 6.25 percent
stake in the Sugarloaf project, according to Eureka’s website.
Aurora, whose shares trade in Sydney and Toronto, has said it
expects to more than double the number of wells it drills in the
area this year.  Aurora’s shares have risen 21 percent this year, compared
with a gain of 8.2 percent for the S&P/ASX 200 Index. Eureka has
more than doubled this year.  Aurora expects to complete the offer by June 15, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
