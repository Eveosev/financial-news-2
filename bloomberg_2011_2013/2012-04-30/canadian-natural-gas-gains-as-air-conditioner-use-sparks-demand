Canadian natural gas rose, headed
for a monthly gain, amid hotter-than-normal weather across the
U.S. that has boosted air-conditioner use.  June gas in  Alberta  advanced 3.6 percent. Cooling demand
across the U.S. will average 80 percent above normal through May
7, according to Weather Derivatives. Demand for gas-fired power
increases with air-conditioner use and gas prices that touched
decade lows in the past month have prompted fuel switching, said
Stephen Smith, an energy analyst in Natchez,  Mississippi .  “There is ongoing evidence for large-scale shifts from
coal-fired generation to gas-fired generation,” said Smith,
president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates.  Alberta gas for June delivery rose 6 cents to C$1.735 a
gigajoule ($1.67 per million British thermal units) as of 3:05
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. May gas
gained 5.5 cents to C$1.69 per gigajoule.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is up 2.8 percent this month, paring its year-to-date
decline to 39 percent.  Natural gas for June delivery rose 9.9 cents, or 4.5
percent, to settle at $2.285 per million Btu on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
1.13 cents to $2.14 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 6.34 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $1.9296 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices advanced 9.52 cents, or 4.9 percent,
to $2.0329.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.9 billion cubic
feet, 109 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.09 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.13 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 1.15 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.5 billion cubic feet today, or 57 percent of
its capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.97
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
