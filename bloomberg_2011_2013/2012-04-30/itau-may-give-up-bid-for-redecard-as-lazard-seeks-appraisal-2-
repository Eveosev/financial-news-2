Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Latin
America’s biggest lender by market value, said it may give up
its plan to buy out  Redecard SA (RDCD3) ’s minority shareholders for 11.8
billion reais ($6.19 billion) after Lazard Asset Management LLC
asked for a new appraisal of Brazil’s second-biggest card
processor.  Itau reaffirmed its offer of 35 reais a share to acquire
the stake in the Barueri, Brazil-based company it doesn’t
already own, according to a regulatory filing today. The Sao
Paulo-based lender said it won’t increase its bid if a second
valuation of the company indicates a higher price than 35 reais.  Lazard, Redecard’s second-biggest investor with a 10
percent stake, requested a shareholder meeting to vote on
whether a new appraisal is justified, the card processor said
April 27. Rothschild & Sons Ltda. valued Redecard’s shares at
34.18 reais to 37.59 reais based on free-cash flow, the bank
said April 5. Using a different method based on the value of
Redecard’s competitor  Cielo SA (CIEL3) , Rothschild said the shares were
worth 36.13 reais to 37.11 reais each.  Redecard’s board scheduled a  shareholders’ meeting  for May
18 to vote on Lazard’s proposal, Itau said today. The Brazilian
bank is Redecard’s biggest shareholder with a 50 percent stake.  Redecard fell 0.8 percent to 32.10 reais in  Sao Paulo 
today, while Cielo rose 2.7 percent to 57.20 reais. Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index gained 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
