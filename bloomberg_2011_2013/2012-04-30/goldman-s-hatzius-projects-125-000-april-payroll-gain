Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. predicted that payrolls in the U.S. climbed by 125,000 in
April, compared with a 120,000 increase the previous month.  Led by Jan Hatzius in  New York , the group’s forecast
compares with a 162,000 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 79 economists ahead of the May 4 employment report
from the Labor Department. Hatzius cited unseasonably warm
winter as the main reason for the projection.  Gains in hiring and wages are needed to support household
purchasing, which increased 0.3 percent in March, Commerce
Department figures show. An  unemployment rate  exceeding 8
percent for more than three years helps explain why Federal
Reserve policy makers are sticking to a plan to boost growth and
employment by holding borrowing costs low through late 2014.  “We are forecasting a nonfarm payroll gain of just 125,000
in April because we expect a substantial payback for the warm
winter,” Hatzius wrote in an April 27 note to clients. “The
payroll acceleration in the winter was confined to the normally
cold states. Moreover, the fact that March payroll gains in the
cold states looked similar to the pre-winter norm suggests that
most of the payback has yet to occur.”  Unseasonably mild temperatures may have spurred more hiring
in some industries. The January to March period was the warmest
first quarter in records going back to 1895, according to the
 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  The weather effect “will lead to a payback of at least
50,000 in the April report,” Hatzius wrote. “The evidence for
slower U.S. growth is accumulating.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
