Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Samsung Electronics
Co. are scheduled to meet next month for settlement talks in
their patent dispute with a U.S. judge reiterating that chief
executive officers from both companies must attend.  The settlement conference is set for May 21 and 22 at 9:30
a.m. local time in a San Francisco courthouse, according to an
order from Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero. Nam Ki Yung, a Seoul-
based Samsung spokesman, confirmed the order, while  Steve Park ,
a Seoul-based spokesman for Apple, declined to comment.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in  San Jose  on April 17
ordered the CEOs of both companies to attend the conference.
Apple claims Samsung’s 4G smartphone and Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet
computer, among other products, infringe its patents. In
December, Koh ruled against Apple’s request to block Suwon,
South Korea-based Samsung from selling the phone and tablet in
the U.S. The order followed an Australian court ruling that
lifted an injunction barring sales in that country.  Spero ordered each side to prepare a settlement conference
statement, outlining the dispute, an evaluation of the parties’
likelihood of winning and their positions on a settlement.  “The more candid the parties are, the more productive the
conference will be,” Spero said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
