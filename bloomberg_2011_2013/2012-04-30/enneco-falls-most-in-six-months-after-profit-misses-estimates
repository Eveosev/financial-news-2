Tenneco Inc. (TEN) , the maker of diesel
exhaust filters and mufflers, fell the most in six months after
reporting profit that missed analystsâ€™ estimates.  Tenneco dropped 10 percent to $32.50 at 10:13 a.m. in  New
York  and earlier fell as much as 11 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Oct. 28. The shares had advanced 21
percent this year before today.  First-quarter net income fell 36 percent to $30 million, or
49 cents a share, from $47 million, or 75 cents, a year earlier,
the  Lake Forest , Illinois-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding items such as 18 cents a share in financing
costs, profit was 66 cents a share, compared with a 73-cent
average of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 8.6 percent to $1.91 billion, compared with
$1.89 billion, the average of eight analyst estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
