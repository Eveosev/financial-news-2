Tropical Bank Ltd. , the Libyan-
owned lender seized by Uganda’s central bank last year, said it
posted a loss in 2011 after customer deposits declined.  The loss totaled 624.2 million shillings ($249,256) in the
12 months through December, compared with a profit of 5.6
billion shillings a year earlier, the Kampala-based bank said in
a statement published today in the New Vision newspaper.
Customer deposits dropped 49 percent to 64.97 billion shillings,
it said.  Uganda took control of Tropical Bank on March 25, 2011, to
protect the lender from sanctions imposed on Libya by the United
Nations and returned it to its owners on March 6. The UN
measures were aimed at halting attacks by slain Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi ’s regime on protesters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
