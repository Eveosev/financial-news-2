Mexico ’s peso posted its first
monthly decline this year as rising borrowing costs in Europe
damped demand for higher-yielding assets in emerging markets.  The peso weakened 0.3 percent to 13.0127 per  U.S. dollar  at
4 p.m. in Mexico City, compared with 12.9678 on April 27. The
currency has fallen 1.6 percent in April, paring its rally in
2012 to 7.1 percent, still the best performance among the 16
most-traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Once again we saw higher volatility in the financial
markets associated with Spain and Europe in general,” Rafael Camarena, an economist at  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , said in a
telephone interview from Mexico City. “That’s what generated
this move.”  Spanish bond yields have climbed about 1 percentage point
since the beginning of March as the government struggles to
persuade investors it can narrow its  budget deficit , adding to
concern Europe’s debt turmoil is spreading.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark bonds due in 2024 was
little changed at 6.31 percent. The price fell 0.04 centavo to
132.00 centavos per peso, paring its increase to 1.47 centavos
per peso this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
