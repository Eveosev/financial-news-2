Copper advanced for a fifth day,
the longest rally since August, as falling inventories fueled
speculation that global supplies will dwindle later this year.  The metal for delivery in three months gained as much as 1
percent to $8,495 per metric ton, the highest level since April
4. The last time prices increased five straight days was August
31. Copper is 0.6 higher this month after a 0.6 percent drop in
March. The July-delivery contract today rose 0.9 percent to
$3.8585 a pound on the Comex in  New York . Markets in  China  are
closed for a holiday today.  “The declines in copper stockpiles, both in London and
 Shanghai , are the key reasons behind the price rally,” Lelia
Kim, a metals trader at Tong Yang Securities Inc., said today by
phone. “People now seem to be paying attention again to a tight
supply situation expected later this year.”  Stockpiles of copper monitored by the London Metal Exchange
have dropped to the lowest since November 2008 and those tracked
by Shanghai’s exchange are the smallest in more than two months,
data from the bourses showed last week.  Copper demand will increasingly exceed supply in the second
half of the year, Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report last
week. “We reiterate our view that both the refined copper and
copper concentrate markets will be in increasing deficit moving
into the second half,” it said.  Consumer Spending  The metal in  London  gained 2.7 percent last week, the
second straight weekly advance, buoyed by a report that showed
the biggest gain in U.S. consumer spending in more than a year.
Hiring in the U.S. probably picked up in April after the weakest
gain in five months, and the jobless rate stayed at 8.2 percent,
showing improvement in the labor market, economists said before
reports this week.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long position in New York copper futures by 1,065
contracts, or 85 percent, in the week ended April 24 from the
previous week, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  data .  On the LME, nickel for delivery in three months gained 1
percent to $18,279 a ton, zinc rose 0.5 percent to $2,051 a ton
and lead was 0.3 percent higher at $2,146.50 a ton. Aluminum
advanced 0.3 percent to $2,114 a ton and tin rose 0.9 percent to
$22,700 per ton, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
