The  increase in orders  to draw
lead from warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange may
be linked to traders moving the metal from one warehouse to
another owned by their own company, Helen Matthews, an analyst
at Brook Hunt, a Wood Mackenzie Ltd. company, said. The
following comments were made by e-mail today.  “This situation has occurred in both aluminum and zinc
previously, and it now looks as if it is happening in lead.  “It seems to be metal being moved between warehouses by
traders that probably already own the warrants but have the
metal stored in rival warehouses.  “They cancel the warrants and move the metal to their own
warehouse to reduce the rent they have to pay to other
warehouses and of course it is cheaper for them to hold their
own material in their own warehouses.  “Once in the warehouse, the metal can go back on warrant
and if the warrants are bought and the metal stays in the
warehouse then the trader gets the benefit of the rent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
