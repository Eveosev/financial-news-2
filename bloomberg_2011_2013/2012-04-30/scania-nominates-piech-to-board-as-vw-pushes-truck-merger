Scania AB (SCVB)  nominated  Volkswagen AG (VOW) 
Chairman Ferdinand Piech to the Swedish truckmaker’s board,
strengthening the German company’s influence as it forges ahead
with a merger of its truck businesses.  Piech, who turned 75 earlier this month, would replace
Gunnar Larsson, the Soedertaelje, Sweden-based company said in a
statement. Shareholders will vote on the proposal at their
annual meeting on May 4.  After raising its stake in  MAN SE (MAN)  to 73 percent on
April 13, VW is continuing to pursue a combination with the
Munich-based truckmaker, Scania and its own commercial-vehicle
operations. Among the options is a domination agreement of MAN,
if VW accumulates a holding of more than 75 percent, Chief
Financial Officer Hans Dieter Poetsch said this month.  “All options are open to us when it comes to the further
structuring of an integrated commercial-vehicles group,” VW
Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  told shareholders on
April 19. “What matters most is close, mutual collaboration
between the different brands, and this is something we have
significantly stepped up in recent weeks and months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
