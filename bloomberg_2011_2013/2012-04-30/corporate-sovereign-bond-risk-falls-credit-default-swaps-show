The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate and sovereign debt fell, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped
six basis points to 638 at 10:10 a.m. in London. The measure is
up from 613 basis points at the start of the month.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings declined 0.5 basis point to 137 basis
points. A decrease signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of
15 governments fell 0.5 basis point to 273.5. The guage has
risen 4.5 basis points this month.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell two basis points to 240.5 and the
subordinated index dropped four to 399.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
