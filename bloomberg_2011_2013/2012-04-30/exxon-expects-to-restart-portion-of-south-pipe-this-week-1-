Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  plans to start
its South Line oil pipeline, which runs from Raceland to
Anchorage, Louisiana, this week.  The 16-inch line, which is part of Exxonâ€™s Southwest
system, will be restarted after the completion of a hydrostatic
test, Rachael Moore, a company spokeswoman based in Fairfax,
Virginia, said in an e-mail.  A portion of the Southwest system from  South Bend  to
Sunset, Louisiana, was shut indefinitely Oct. 31, according to a
bulletin to shippers obtained at the time by Bloomberg.  Exxon shut the pipeline after a special permit application
on the segment was rejected by the federal Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Patricia Errico, an
Exxon spokeswoman, said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
