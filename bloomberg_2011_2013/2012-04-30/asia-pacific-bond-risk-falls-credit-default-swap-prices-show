The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index slid 6 basis points to
153 basis points as of 10:21 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG. The gauge is set for its lowest close since
April 6, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 4 basis points to 163 basis points
as of 8:22 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The index is headed for its lowest close since
April 17, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  Both indexes are set for a second straight monthly gain.
The Australian benchmark is poised to rise 5.4 basis points this
month, and the Asian gauge is headed for an increase of 3.4, CMA
prices show.  In  Japan , the measure increased 28.3 to 182.4 as of April
27, also a second monthly climb and the biggest jump since
November, according to CMA. The Japan market is closed today for
a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
