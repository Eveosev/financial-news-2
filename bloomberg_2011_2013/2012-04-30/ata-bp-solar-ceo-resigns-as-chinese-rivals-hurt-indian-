The chief executive officer of Tata
BP Solar Ltd. resigned, exiting  India ’s third-largest panel
maker as the industry struggles to cope with oversupply from
Chinese competitors that’s crushed prices.  K. Subramanya said in an e-mail that tomorrow will be his
last day at the head of the solar company and that he hasn’t
decided yet what he will do next. He didn’t provide a reason for
his resignation.  Indian panel makers such as Tata BP,  Indosolar Ltd. (ISLR)  and
 Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI)  are struggling along with counterparts in
the U.S. and Europe after lower-cost Chinese manufacturers
boosted supply. Germany and Italy, the two biggest markets for
the technology, have scaled back subsidies for renewable energy.  Indian manufacturers received almost no orders for the more
than 700 megawatts of sun-powered capacity under construction in
the nation last year and have idled their factories, Subramanya
said in an interview in December.  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) , the utility arm of the industrial group
that owns Jaguar Land Rover, agreed to buy out  BP Plc (BP/) ’s stake in
the Indian joint venture in December after the British oil
company said it was winding down its solar business worldwide.  Prices of silicon-based panels plunged 47 percent in the
past year, helping to tip at least seven U.S. and German
manufacturers into bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
