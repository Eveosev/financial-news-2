Colt Resources Inc. (GTP) , an explorer of
gold in Portugal, found gold mineralization in deposits across a
30-kilometer (19 mile) stretch of land in the country’s south.  The company, based in  Montreal , signed a three-year
exploration deal with the government in November to look for
gold in the Boa Fe zone near the town of Montemor.  “We continue to be impressed by the results from this well
mineralized shear zone,” Colt said today in a  statement on its
website.  “The company will continue its aggressive advanced
stage exploration campaign at Boa Fe.”  Colt plans to bring the Montemor mine into production early
2014, Chief Executive Officer Nikolas Perrault said on April 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
