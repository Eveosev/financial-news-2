The zloty weakened against the
euro, heading for a second monthly loss, after a report showed
 Spain ’s economy entered its second recession since 2009 amid
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  Poland’s currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 4.1731 per
euro as of 4:37 p.m. in Warsaw. The zloty lost 0.5 percent so
far in April, adding to a 0.7 percent drop in March. It has
appreciated 7 percent this year, making it the fourth-best
performer among more than 20 emerging market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  The government’s benchmark 10-year bonds dropped nine basis
points to 5.4 percent and two-year bonds climbed two basis
points to 4.64 percent.  Gross domestic product in Spain, the euro area’s fourth-
largest economy, fell 0.3 percent, the same as in the previous
three months, the Madrid-based National Statistics Institute
said today. From a year ago, GDP slid 0.4 percent. The euro
region is  Poland ’s main export market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
