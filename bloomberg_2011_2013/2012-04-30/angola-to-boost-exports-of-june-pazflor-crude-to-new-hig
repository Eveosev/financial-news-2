Angola ,  Africa â€™s second-largest oil
producer, plans to increase exports of Pazflor crude for June by
one cargo from May to seven shipments, the most since the field
started production in October, according to a final loading
program obtained by Bloomberg.  Exports of the grade will be 221,667 barrels a day, up from
183,871 barrels a day in May, the schedule showed. The capacity
of the field is about 220,000 barrels a day, according to  Total
SA (FP) , which operates the project.  Crude exports from the West African nation will total 52
cargoes, three fewer than May. Shipments will total 49.87
million barrels, or 1.66 million barrels a day, compared with
1.7 million barrels, the plan showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of the program are as follows. Cargo sizes are
listed in multiples of 1,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
