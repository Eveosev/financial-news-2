European stocks rose as  Spain 
reported its economy shrank less than previously forecast in the
first quarter.  The benchmark Stoxx 600 advanced 0.4 percent to 260.06 at
8:02 a.m. in London.  Spanish gross domestic product fell 0.3 percent, the same
as in the previous three months, the Madrid-based National
Statistics Institute said in an e-mailed statement today. That
compares with the Bank of Spainâ€™s estimate on April 23 of a 0.4
percent decline. From a year ago, GDP fell 0.4 percent, INE
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
