Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-biggest producer after the U.S., will harvest
less of the oilseed than previously forecast after dry weather
cut yields in the country’s south, AgRural Commodities Agricolas
said.  The outlook for the crop year that started Sept. 1 was cut
to 66.2 million metric tons, from 66.7 million tons estimated on
March 26, the Curitiba, Brazil-based crop researcher said in an
e-mailed statement. Output will fall from a record 75.3 million
tons in the previous crop year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
