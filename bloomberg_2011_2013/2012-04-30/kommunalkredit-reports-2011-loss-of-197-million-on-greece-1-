Kommunalkredit  Austria  AG, the
nationalized municipal lender Austria plans to sell, reported a
full-year loss because of Greek writedowns.  The bank’s net loss after minorities was 148.8 million
euros ($197 million), compared to a profit of 24.6 million euros
a year earlier, the Vienna-based company said today in its
 annual report . Kommunalkredit had a writedown of 176.3 million
euros on Greek government bonds, according to the report. The
bank on March 9 had warned of a 140 million-euro net loss on
 Greece .  Austria, which has owned Kommunalkredit since 2008, when
the bank was nationalized to avoid a collapse when liquidity
dried up, in November decided to sell the lender again. Since
its nationalization, the bank was split into the municipal
lending unit and KA Finanz AG, a “bad bank” that took on
securities, loans and credit default swaps that are not part of
that main business business and is winding down those assets.  “After 2011 results that were substantially impacted by
the restructuring of Greek  government bonds , an item which
couldn’t be compensated by better-than-planned operating
results, Kommunalkredit expects positive results for 2012,” the
company said in the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
