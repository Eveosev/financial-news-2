Indian stocks rose, paring a
monthly loss, as software exporters gained after the benchmark
gauge for U.S. equities capped the best week in a month.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) ,  India ’s largest software
maker, advanced to a two-month high.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the second
biggest, rose to a two-week high. The two companies earn more
than half their revenues from  North America , data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The Standard and Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.8
percent last week, the most since March 16, as company earnings
exceeded forecasts.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.7 percent
to 17,311.88, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge is still poised for a second straight
monthly loss. Tata Consultancy Services trades at 19.1 times
future earnings, while Infosys is valued 15 times, compared with
a multiple of 15.9 times on the BSE IT Index of 10 software
makers, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex has risen 12 percent this year as foreign funds
 pumped  $8.72 billion into local stocks on optimism the central
bank would ease monetary policy after a record tightening in
funding costs slowed economic growth, eroded company profits and
as rifts within Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s coalition led to
a policy deadlock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
