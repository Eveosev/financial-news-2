Pakistan International Airlines
Corp. (PIAA) , the nation’s largest carrier, posted a first-quarter
loss, weighed down by rising fuel and labor costs.  The net loss widened to 7.9 billion rupees ($87 million) in
the three months ended March 31 from 4.2 billion rupees, the
airline said in a statement to the Karachi Stock Exchange today.
Revenue was 28 billion rupees.  PIA, based in Karachi, also reported a loss for 2011 as it
struggled with a workforce of more than 21,500 people to run a
fleet of 40 planes. In comparison,  Singapore  Airlines Ltd.
employed 21,997 people, as of March 2011, for a fleet of 100
planes. PIA paid more for fuel in the first quarter because
prices averaged about 11 percent higher than a year earlier in
Singapore.  Overstaffing is a “major problem,” said Umar Hafiz, an
analyst at Arif Habib Ltd., a brokerage in Karachi. The carrier
“will have to embark on an aggressive strategy to increase its
competitiveness.”  Net loss for 2011 was 25.9 billion rupees, compared with a
20 billion-rupee loss in the previous year. Revenue rose 8
percent to 127.5 billion rupees.  The carrier fell 0.9 percent to 2.29 rupees at close in
Karachi. It has risen 16 percent this year, compared with a 25
percent gain for the benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  PIA in February announced an order for five  Boeing Co. (BA) 
777-300ER planes, worth about $1.5 billion at list prices.
Airlines usually get discounts on large orders. The carrier also
took five options.  To contact the reporter on this story:
