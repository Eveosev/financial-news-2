America Movil (AMXL)  SAB, the wireless
carrier controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , offered to cut
fees to rivals and provide customers calls to other networks for
no additional charge to convince  Mexico ’s antitrust commission
to overturn a $1 billion fine.  Mexico’s largest phone carrier said today in a filing that
it proposed the concessions in March during the antitrust
agency’s review of the fine. The penalty was assessed a year ago
for monopolistic practices in the market for fees charged to
rivals.  The antitrust agency is scheduled to vote today on whether
to uphold, overturn or reduce the fine. If it maintains the
penalty, America Movil will seek an injunction, it said in the
filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It’s
“not probable” that the company will end up having to pay the
fine, it said.  Under Mexican law, the antitrust agency must notify the
parties involved in the case before it can announce the result
of today’s vote.  America Movil ’s proposal included reducing the
interconnection fees it charges to rivals to 31 centavos (2.4
cents) a minute in 2014 from 39 centavos last year. It committed
to providing plans with some minutes to call any mobile network
at the same rate, and pledged to allow the antitrust agency to
access information to verify it was complying with the
concessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
