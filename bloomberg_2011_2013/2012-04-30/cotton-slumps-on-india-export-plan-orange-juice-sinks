Cotton futures fell the most in
three weeks on signs that supplies will increase as  India , the
world’s second-biggest producer, resumes exports of the fiber.
 Orange juice  also sank.  India will suspend a ban on shipments after protests from
traders and on a forecast that the harvest may top estimates,
Commerce Minister  Anand Sharma  said. On March 5, the country
barred exports to secure domestic supplies after sales abroad
surged above a government surplus estimate. Through April 19,
the U.S. exported 3.97 million bales of upland cotton to  China 
in the season that began Aug. 1, 18 percent more than a year
earlier, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  “This announcement by India will help to ease fears of a
nearby supply squeeze brought about by Chinese hoarding,” Peter Egli, a Chicago-based director of risk management at Plexus
Cotton Ltd., said in an e-mail.  Cotton for July delivery slid 2 percent to settle at 89.4
cents a pound at 2:33 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , the
biggest decline for a most-active contract since April 4.
Earlier, the commodity reached 87.87 cents, the lowest since
April 17. This month, the price retreated 4.4 percent, the most
since November.  Stockpiles of certified cotton at warehouses monitored by
ICE climbed 44 percent to 135,811 running bales as of April 27
from the end of March, exchange data show.  India’s decision “will probably put some pressure” on the
July contract, especially with bigger inventories, Egli said.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest shipper and  China  is the
largest user and grower of cotton. A running bale weighs 500
pounds, or 227 kilograms.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery declined 4.2 percent
to $1.4185 a pound on ICE. The beverage plunged 14 percent in
April, the third monthly loss and the longest slide since the
end of 2008.  U.S. retail sales of the beverage fell 11 percent to 39.05
million gallons in the four weeks ended April 14 from a year
earlier, the Florida Department of Citrus said today in a
report, citing Nielsen Co. data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
