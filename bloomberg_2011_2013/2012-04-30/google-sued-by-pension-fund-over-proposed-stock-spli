Google Inc. (GOOG) , the world’s largest
Web-search provider, was sued by a Massachusetts city’s pension
fund claiming the company’s planned stock split would unfairly
create nonvoting shares.  The Brockton Retirement Board contends that officials of
 Mountain View , California-based Google failed to act in the best
interests of shareholders in creating a new class of stock.  “The reclassification effort is a thinly veiled attempt to
entrench” co-founders  Larry Page  and  Sergey Brin  “as dominant
shareholders of Google by creating a non-voting class of Google
stock in order to preserve their voting power into perpetuity,”
the Brockton fund said in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint
made public today in Wilmington.  Google now has Class A common shares, which have one vote
each, and Class B shares, mostly held by the founders. Under the
reclassification, all shareholders will receive a dividend of
new, non-voting Class C stock in what amounts to a 2-for-1 stock
split, according to the complaint.  Google officials didn’t immediately return voice and e-mail
messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The Brockton fund asked a judge to block the new stock plan
and award unspecified compensatory damages.  The case is Brockton Retirement Board v. Page, CA7469,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
