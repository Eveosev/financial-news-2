Bahrain’s  Accounting & Auditing
Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions  issued seven
Islamic standards for the industry, the regulator’s Secretary
General Khaled Al Faqih said today.  The guidelines will govern financial rights or the disposal
of rights, bankruptcy and liquidity management, Al Faqih said at
a news conference in the capital Manama. The agency also listed
rules for capital and investments protection, investment agency
contracts, profit calculations from investment instruments, and
the right to terminate legal contracts due to fraud, he said.  AAOIFI, which has 200 members, sets accounting and auditing
standards that are used in Bahrain, the Dubai International
Financial Centre, Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Sudan and Syria,
according to its website. It has issued 48 Shariah guidelines
and regulators in countries including Malaysia,  Saudi Arabia ,
 Australia  and South Africa base some of their rules on AAOIFI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
