Melbourne Rebels fly-half Danny Cipriani will leave the Super Rugby team before the end of the
season to return to  England  earlier than scheduled.  Cipriani, the first England international to play for an
Australian team in the southern hemisphere’s elite provincial
competition, had been set to leave the Rebels in August after
signing with English club Sale Sharks.  “Going to be sad to leave all my teammates,” Cipriani,
24, said on his Twitter account today. “Made some friends for
life over here. I said goodbye to the boys: got 5/6 words out
couldn’t hold my tears back.”  Cipriani, who’s played seven Tests for England, was a
marquee signing for the Rebels’ inaugural season in 2011 though
was dropped from the team for a month because of off-field
disciplinary issues. He scored 119 points in 19 games for the
Rebels, including a last-minute penalty against the ACT Brumbies
last year that gave the club its first Super Rugby victory.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
