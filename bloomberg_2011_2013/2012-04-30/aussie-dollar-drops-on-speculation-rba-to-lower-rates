The Australian dollar weakened against
most of its major counterparts before a central bank meeting
where policy makers are forecast to reduce  interest rates  for
the first time this year.  The Aussie and New Zealand’s dollar fell versus their U.S.
counterpart and the yen after Spain entered recession for the
second time since 2009, fueling concern Europe’s debt crisis is
worsening, and U.S. economic data were weaker than forecast. The
 Reserve Bank  of Australia will cut its  benchmark rate  to 4
percent, from 4.25 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “It sounds like we could see a 25 basis-point rate cut,”
said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in  Washington  at Western
Union Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co. “If the
tone of the statement comes across more dovish, that would keep
on the table the chance of more easing down the road, so that
would pressure the Aussie dollar.”  Australia ’s dollar lost 0.4 percent to $1.0429 yesterday in
 New York  in its first drop in four days. It weakened 1 percent
to 83.25 yen. New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, fell
0.5 percent to 81.85 U.S. cents in its first decline in four
days and dropped 1 percent to 65.32 yen.  The Aussie rose 0.8 percent versus the dollar this month,
while its New Zealand counterpart was little changed.  Spain’s  gross domestic product  fell 0.3 percent in the
first quarter, the same as in the previous three months, the
Madrid-based National Statistics Institute said. From a year
ago, GDP slid 0.4 percent, the institute said.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its
 business barometer  decreased to 56.2 in April from 62.2 a month
earlier. It was the least since November 2009. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey forecast a decline to 60. Readings greater than
50 signal growth.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of equities fell 0.4 percent yesterday
as investor appetite for riskier assets ebbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
