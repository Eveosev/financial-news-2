Following is a table of shutdowns
at nuclear power plants in  Spain  for 2012, according to data
from Madrid-based utilities lobby Unesa.  All eight of the nation’s reactors were operating today,
according to the website of  Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear , the
country’s nuclear regulator. Spain produces about 20 percent of
its electricity from atomic energy.  The table lists halts for plants owned by  Endesa SA (ELE) ,
 Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  and Nucleanor SA. There are no
planned halts for the 1,092-megawatt Cofrentes, 1,027-megawatt
Asco-2 or 466-megawatt Santa Maria de Garona reactors this year,
Unesa said.
