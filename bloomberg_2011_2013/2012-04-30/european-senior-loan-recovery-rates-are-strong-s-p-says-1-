Recovery rates in the European
senior loan market have been strong and in line with those of
the more mature U.S. market, according to  Standard & Poorâ€™s .  A study found the European first-lien debt had a 76 percent
average recovery rate when 101 defaults between 2003 and 2010
were evaluated, S&P analysts led by David Gillmor wrote in a
report. That compares with a mean recovery rate of 84 percent
for U.S. loan facilities between 1987 and 2011, according to the
report.  Junk bonds  and other European senior unsecured debt
recovered 48 percent over the survey period, compared with a 52
percent rate for speculative-grade notes in the U.S., S&P said.
Second-lien debt, which ranks below senior debt in capital
structures, recovered an average of 31 percent and the most-
subordinated mezzanine loans recovered 30 percent.  Publically rated companies had a lower average first-lien
recovery rate than those with private credit estimates,
recovering a mean of 62 percent and 79 percent respectively, S&P
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
