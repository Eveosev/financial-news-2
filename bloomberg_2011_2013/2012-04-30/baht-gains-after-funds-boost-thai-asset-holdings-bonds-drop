Thailand ’s baht reached a two-week
high after international investors raised holdings of the
nation’s assets on optimism improving regional economies will
boost export growth.  Government bonds  fell.  Global funds  bought  $30 million more Thai equities than
they sold on April 27 and $271 million more local debt, data
from the stock exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association
show.  Asia  will expand 6 percent this year and 6.5 percent in
2013, compared with 5.9 percent in 2011, the  International
Monetary Fund  said last week. The baht was set for a monthly
gain after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he may
add more stimulus if needed to spur the  U.S. economy .  “The market seems to be expecting another round of easing,
and that is why the higher-yielding currencies are rising,”
said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok
Bank Pcl. “Investors are also waiting for more U.S. data this
week.”  The baht advanced 0.1 percent today and 0.4 percent this
month to 30.73 per dollar as of 8:37 a.m. in Bangkok, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 30.72 today,
the strongest level since April 13.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange
rate swings used to price options, was unchanged today and from
the end of last month at 4.52 percent.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
was at 53 in April, compared with 53.4 the previous month,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey before data due tomorrow. The government will report on
May 4 that companies in the world’s largest economy added
165,000 jobs this month, compared with 120,000 in March,
according to a separate poll.  The yield on Thailand’s 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017
rose two basis points today to 3.59 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It dropped eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
