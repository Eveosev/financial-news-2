The pound reached a 22-month high
against the euro after an industry report showed British  house
prices  rose in April, boosting demand for U.K. assets.  Sterling touched an eight-month high versus the dollar
after the  Swiss National Bank  said it almost doubled its
holdings of pounds in the first quarter. The U.K. currency later
erased gains versus the greenback as a technical gauge signaled
its 10-day advance was overdone. Ten-year gilts rose.  “The housing data wasn’t too bad,” said  Neil Jones , the
head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.
in London. “It doesn’t take a lot of positive data to boost the
pound at the moment as there is so much expectation of gloom.
Any glimmer of hope can help the currency appreciate.”  The pound was little changed at 81.47 pence per euro at
4:06 p.m.  London  time after rising to 81.23 pence, the strongest
since June 2010. Sterling fell 0.2 percent to $1.6236 after
climbing to $1.6302, the highest level since Aug. 31. It gained
2.6 percent over the previous two weeks.  U.K. home values rose 0.1 percent from March, when they
increased 0.2 percent, the London-based property research
company said in an e-mailed report.  House prices  gained in four
of 10 regions monitored by Hometrack in April, led by a 0.3
percent gain in London.  The SNB boosted holdings of the U.K. currency by 93 percent
last quarter to 14.5 billion pounds from 7.5 billion pounds in
the previous three months, the Zurich-based central bank’s
foreign-currency holdings report showed today.  Net Longs  Futures traders reversed bets the pound would weaken
against the dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission showed.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the U.K. currency
compared with those on a decline -- so-called net longs -- was
7,536 on April 24, compared with net shorts of 13,051 the
previous week.  The pound erased its advance against the dollar as a gauge
of momentum watched by some traders showed its recent gains were
excessive. The relative strength index for the U.K. currency
increased to 71.3 on April 27. Readings above 70 suggest a
currency is overbought.  The pound rose for the previous 10 days against the dollar,
the longest winning streak since June 1992.  Sterling has appreciated 1.5 percent in the past month, the
second-best performer after the yen of 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar dropped 0.1 percent, and the euro fell 1.1 percent.  The yield on the  10-year gilt  dropped one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 2.11 percent. The 4 percent bond due
March 2022 gained 0.11, or 1.10 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 116.70.  Debt Sales  The Debt Management Office plans to auction as much as 3.75
billion pounds of seven-year notes tomorrow, and 1.2 billion
pounds of inflation-linked securities due March 2034 on May 3.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Treasuries
rose 0.1 percent, and German bunds gained 1.2 percent.  The euro may extend this year’s decline against the pound
after failing to break above a key level of so-called resistance
last week, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  “Near-term rebounds have remained capped by the previous
82.21 pence January low,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income,
commodity and currency technical analysis in London, wrote in a
note to clients.  The euro is poised to fall to the 2010 low of 80.67 pence
over the next one to three months, Jones said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
