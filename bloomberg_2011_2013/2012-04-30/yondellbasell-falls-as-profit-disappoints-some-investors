LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) , the
world’s biggest maker of polypropylene resins, fell the most in
eight weeks after first-quarter earnings disappointed some
investors and amid speculation of higher raw-materials costs.  LyondellBasell slid 5.9 percent to $43.04 at 1:09 p.m. in
 New York . The shares earlier dropped as much as 6.8 percent, the
biggest intraday decline since March 6. Before today, the stock
was up 42 percent for the year.  Profit excluding asset-impairment costs and other items was
$1.07, topping the $1.04 average estimate of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Investors wanted a blockbuster first quarter,”  Hassan Ahmed , a New York-based analyst at Alembic Global Advisors who
recommends buying the shares, said today in a telephone
interview. “It’s clearly the buy side that is disappointed.”  Net income fell to $1.04 a share from $1.15 a year earlier
after prices rose for oil, which is used to make chemicals in
 Europe , Rotterdam-based LyondellBasell said in a statement.  Some investors are concerned that ethane, a raw material
used to make ethylene in the U.S., will cost more in the second
half as demand increases following the completion of first-half
maintenance projects, Ahmed said. LyondellBasell is starting the
second of two ethylene units in Channelview,  Texas , after
completing maintenance, Chief Executive Officer James Gallogly
said today on a conference call.  Ethane may rise in the third quarter followed by lower
prices in the fourth quarter extending through 2013 and 2014,
Gallogly said.  First-quarter net income fell 9.5 percent to $600 million
from $663 million. Sales declined 3 percent to $11.9 billion,
matching the average estimate of 11 estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
