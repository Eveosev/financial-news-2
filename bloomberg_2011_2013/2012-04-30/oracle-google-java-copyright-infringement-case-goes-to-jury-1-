Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s case against  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  alleging copyright infringement over the use of the Java
programming language for Android software went to the jury for
deliberations.  The 12-person panel will decide whether Google, the largest
Web-search operator, infringed parts of Java in developing
Android. Java is a free programming language invented by Sun
Microsystems Inc. and Android runs on more than 300 million
smartphones. Oracle, the largest maker of database software,
acquired Java when it bought Sun in 2010.  If jurors find that Google infringed Java, they need to
also decide whether it constituted “fair use,” according to
the verdict form in the case. Anyone can use copyrighted work
without consent of the owner if it advances the public interest,
by adding something new or functional, U.S. District Judge
William Alsup, who presides over the trial, told the jury today.  The panel is also deciding whether the elements of Java
that Google conceded it used were too small to be considered
infringement.  Oracle is seeking $1 billion in damages. The jury won’t
decide damages in this phase of the trial.  The case is Oracle v. Google, 10-3561, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
