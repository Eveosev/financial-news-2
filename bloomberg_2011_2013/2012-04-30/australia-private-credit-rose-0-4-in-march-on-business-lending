Loans provided by Australian banks
and finance companies gained 0.4 percent in March from the
previous month, the nation’s  Reserve Bank  said today.  The median estimate of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News was for a 0.3 percent monthly advance. Total lending
increased 3.4 percent from a year earlier, the central bank
said, more than the median forecast for a 3.2 percent annual
increase.  Loans to consumers to buy houses rose 0.4 percent from
February and 5.3 percent from a year earlier, according to
today’s statement. Credit provided to consumers for purchases
other than housing increased 0.1 percent last month for an
annual decline of 1.5 percent.  Lending to companies advanced 0.6 percent from February and
increased 1.3 percent from a year earlier, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
