Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.,  China ’s
biggest electronic commerce company, received about $2.5 billion
in bank commitments in the senior syndication stage of a $3
billion loan, according to two people familiar with the matter.  As many as 15 banks have committed to the facility, said
the people, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. The loan is fully underwritten, people familiar with
the matter said previously.  Alibaba Group, controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, is
seeking the financing to take Alibaba.com Ltd. private. It has
offered as much as HK$19.6 billion ($2.5 billion) to buy the 27
percent stake in the unit that it doesn’t already own.  Alibaba.com had the smallest quarterly profit in two years
after selling fewer website subscriptions to exporters. Net
income fell to 339.2 million yuan ($54 million) in the three
months ended March 31, from 452.5 million yuan in the same
period a year earlier, the company said in a statement on April
23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
