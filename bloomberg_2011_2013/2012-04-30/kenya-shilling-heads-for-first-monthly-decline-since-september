Kenya ’s shilling headed for its
first monthly decline since September, as the central bank
purchased dollars to bolster its reserves.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy was little
changed at 83.05 per dollar by 5:14 p.m. in Nairobi. A close at
this level would give it a 0.2 percent drop this month, the
first monthly depreciation since September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Foreign-currency reserves rose to $4.64 billion in the week
to April 26, from $4.45 billion a week earlier, the Central Bank
of Kenya said on April 27. The bank accepted all 6.55 billion
shillings ($78.6 million) of bids today for seven-day  repurchase
agreements , after offering 10 billion shillings of the
securities, at a weighted average rate of 14.916 percent, a
 central bank  official, who declined to be named in line with the
bank policy, said on phone from Nairobi.  “The shilling weakness is due to increased money supply as
a result of the central bank decision last week to increase its
reserves by purchasing dollars from the market,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa
Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Uganda ’s shilling climbed 0.5 percent to 2,502 per dollar,
heading for its biggest gain in two weeks, while Tanzania’s was
little changed at 1585 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
