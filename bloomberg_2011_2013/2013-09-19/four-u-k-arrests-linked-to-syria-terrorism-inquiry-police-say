Two British men arrested Sept. 16
for suspected terrorism overseas have been linked to activity in
 Syria , police said.  The men, 22 and 29, were arrested and ammunition seized in
the coastal town of Dover,  England , as they returned from the
French port of Calais. The arrests are Syria-related, The
Metropolitan Police said in a statement today.  Another man, 37, and a 36-year-old-woman were arrested
yesterday in Essex, in connection with the inquiry, police said.  All four remain in custody in London. Search warrants have
been issued for addresses in east London and Lancashire, in
northwest England, as part of the investigation that is being
led by the Metâ€™s Counter Terrorism Command.  Syria remains embroiled in a civil war that has killed more
than 100,000 people and uprooted about 6 million. The country
has faced intense scrutiny from world powers, including the
U.K., in recent weeks over the use of chemical arms against
civilians.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
