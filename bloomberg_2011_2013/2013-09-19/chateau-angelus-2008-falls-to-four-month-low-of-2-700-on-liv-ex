A case of 2008 red wine from
Chateau Angelus, a Saint-Emilion wine estate promoted to the
region’s top status of Premier Grand Cru Classe A last year,
sold for 1,700 pounds ($2,700) on Liv-ex this week, slipping to
a four-month low.  While the price was 8 percent down from the peak of 1,840
pounds a case touched on London-based Liv-ex in June, it was
above the 1,600 pounds at which it traded May 7 and still left
the vintage 52 percent above its level at the end of August last
year, just prior to the estate’s promotion, Liv-ex data showed.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, has slipped 1 percent since the end of June, extending a
2 percent second-quarter drop amid a muted investor response to
Bordeaux 2012 sales. There are signs of a revival in demand,
with collectors showing appetite for wines from the right back
of the Dordogne such as Pomerol and Saint-Emilion, which are
made in smaller quantities than left-bank clarets and are often
Merlot-dominated.  “Far outperforming the other indices is the Right Bank
100, which has risen 16.9 percent year-on-year,” Liv-ex said in
a market commentary blog this month.  The Right Bank 100 Index includes Angelus, which was
promoted along with Chateau Pavie last year, joining Chateau
Ausone and Chateau Cheval Blanc in Saint-Emilion’s top tier of
wine producers. The new rankings replaced a classification in
force since 1996.  Eight Generations  Angelus 2008 is cheaper than the estate’s two subsequent
vintages in merchant listings, although more expensive than its
2011 wines, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The 2008 Angelus has a 93 rating on the 100-point scale
used by U.S. critic  Robert Parker , lower than the score assigned
to at least six other vintages in the past 10 years.  The estate is owned by Hubert de Bouard de Laforest, whose
family traces its connection with the vineyard back through
eight generations, according to its website. The current
property took shape during the 20th century, when the family’s
Chateau Mazerat estate absorbed a neighboring plot of vines
known as L’Angelus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
