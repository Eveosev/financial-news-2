CHC Group Ltd., the world’s largest
commercial operator of helicopters, filed to raise $400 million
in a U.S. initial public offering.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , UBS AG and Barclays Plc are managing
the sale, according to a regulatory  filing  today. The $400
million is a placeholder amount used to calculate fees, and may
change. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company didn’t
specify how many shares it will sell or at what price.  CHC’s owner, First Reserve Corp., will continue to hold the
bulk of the voting power following the IPO, the filing shows.
The company has applied to list on the New York Stock Exchange.  First Reserve acquired CHC in September 2008. The company’s
services include helping  oil companies  make staff changes aboard
drilling rigs and providing search and rescue assistance to
governments. CHC generated $1.74 billion in revenue for the year
ended April 30, the filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
