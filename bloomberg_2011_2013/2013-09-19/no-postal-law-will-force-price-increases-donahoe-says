The U.S.  Postal Service ,
approaching next month with only five days cash on hand, may
need to raise prices by more than the inflation rate if Congress
change the service’s business model, Postmaster General Patrick
Donahoe said.  “Unless the Postal Service is given the legal authority to
close the budget gap, an exigent price adjustment may be
necessary in order to ensure that the Postal Service will be
able to maintain and continue the development of postal services
of the type and quality the country needs,” Donahoe said in
testimony prepared for a hearing today on the Senate’s postal
bill.  The service’s board is scheduled next week. It can’t
implement price increases beyond the rate of inflation without
regulatory approval.  The service has said it expects to lose $6 billion this
year and miss a third year of required payments to cover costs
of future retirees’ health care.  To contact the reporter on this story:
