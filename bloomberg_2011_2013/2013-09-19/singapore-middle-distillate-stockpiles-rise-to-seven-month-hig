Middle distillate  inventories rose
to the highest level in more than seven months in  Singapore ,
 Asia â€™s largest oil-trading and storage center, according to a
unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Onshore stockpiles of middle distillates, a category that
includes gasoil and kerosene, increased 1.2 percent to 10.9
million barrels in the seven days to yesterday,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement today.
Supplies are at the highest level since Jan. 30.  Residual fuel  inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen fell 4.4 percent to 22.6
million barrels, the lowest in three weeks.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha,
reformate and gasoline rose 3.1 percent to 11.1 million barrels,
the data showed.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
