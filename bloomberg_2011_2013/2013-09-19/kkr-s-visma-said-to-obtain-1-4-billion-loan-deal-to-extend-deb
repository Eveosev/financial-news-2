Visma Group, a Norwegian maker of
 business software , agreed to a loan pact of 8.1 billion
Norwegian kroner ($1.4 billion) that extends debt backing its
2010 buyout by  KKR & Co. (KKR)   The facilities comprise 7.9 billion kroner of term loans
that mature in 4 1/2 and 5 years as well as a 200 million kroner
credit line, according to two people with knowledge of the deal,
who asked not to be identified because the financing is private.
The debt includes 2 billion kroner of new borrowing that funds a
dividend as well as investments by the company.  Ludo Bammens, a spokesman in London for KKR, didn’t reply
to an e-mail and a telephone call seeking comment on the
financing.  KKR bought a majority stake in Oslo-based Visma in
September 2010 in a deal valuing the company at 11 billion
kroner. The Norwegian company then raised 5.2 billion kroner of
loans arranged by DNB ASA and  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Visma obtained additional loans in 2011,
according to a company  report .  The debt was arranged by DNB, SEB AB and Danske Bank, the
people familiar with the transaction said.  Visma  posted second-quarter earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of 311 million kroner, 22 percent
higher than the same period last year, according to its website.
KKR funds have a 76.1 percent stake in the business while other
shareholders include private-equity firm HgCapital LLP which
owns 17.5 percent, according to a 2012 company  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
