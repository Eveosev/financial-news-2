A federal judge accepted a
 Halliburton Co. (HAL)  unit’s guilty plea to destroying tests conducted
on cement work connected to the BP Plc-owned well that exploded
in 2010, setting off the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  Officials of  Halliburton Energy Services Inc. , which worked
on BP’s Macondo well, announced in July the company would plead
guilty on the unit’s behalf to one count of destroying evidence
for failing to preserve computer models examining the final
cement job on the well after the April 2010 explosion that
killed 11 workers and sent millions of barrels of oil pouring
into the gulf.  The Halliburton unit agreed to plead guilty to one
misdemeanor violation over the deletion of records created after
the Macondo well incident, pay the statutory maximum fine of
$200,000 and accept a term of three years’ probation. U.S.
District Judge Jane Triche Milazzo accepted the plea at a
hearing in New Orleans federal court today.  “I believe the plea agreement is reasonable,” Milazzo
said. The penalty “adequately reflects the seriousness” of the
violation, she said.  The case is U.S. v. Halliburton Energy Services Inc., 13-cr-00165, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana
(New Orleans).  To contact the reporters on this story:
