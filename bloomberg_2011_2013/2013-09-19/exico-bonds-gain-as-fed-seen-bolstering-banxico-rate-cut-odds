Mexico’s benchmark bonds advanced,
sending yields to the lowest level since July, as speculation
mounts that policy makers will cut  interest rates  after the U.S.
Federal Reserve decided to maintain its stimulus program.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell 20 basis points, or
0.21 percentage point, to 5.77 percent at 9:08 a.m. in Mexico
City trading, the lowest level since July 23 on a closing basis,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 2.04
centavos to 134.90 centavos per peso. The peso weakened 0.2
percent to 12.6798 per  U.S. dollar .  Mexican bonds have rallied since the Fed held back
yesterday from reducing unprecedented stimulus, with yields on
the Latin American nation’s benchmark bonds plunging 38 basis
points over the past two days. The Fed decision eliminates an
obstacle to further cuts in  Mexico ’s key rate after policy
makers lowered the benchmark to a record-low 3.75 percent from 4
percent on Sept. 6, according to Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB.  “The relief rally is continuing this morning after the
decision yesterday by the Fed to not announce tapering,”
Alejandro Padilla, a strategist with Banorte, wrote in an e-mailed research note today. The Fed decision “increases the
probabilities that Banxico may reduce the  reference rate .”  Banorte projects the central bank will lower the rate by
another 25 basis points when it meets next on Oct. 25, and it
recommends buying peso bonds due in 2016. Yields on those
securities fell five basis points today.  Nomura Holdings Inc. strategist  Benito Berber  said in an e-mailed note today that the central bank “will likely lower the
policy rate at least” by 25 basis points at its next meeting on
Oct. 25, citing the delay in Fed tapering. He said a deeper cut,
or more than one reduction, are also possible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
