The Conference Boardâ€™s index of
leading economic indicators increased 0.7 percent in August, the
New York-based group said today.  The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists
called for a 0.6 percent advance. Estimates of 44 economists
ranged from increases of 0.2 percent to 0.8 percent.  Another report today showed  jobless claims  in the U.S. rose
less than forecast last week as two states began working through
a backlog of applications that were caused by computer-system
changeovers.  Applications for  unemployment benefits  climbed by 15,000 to
309,000 in the week ended Sept. 14 from a revised 294,000 in the
prior period, a Labor Department report showed in  Washington .
The median forecast of 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for an increase to 330,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
