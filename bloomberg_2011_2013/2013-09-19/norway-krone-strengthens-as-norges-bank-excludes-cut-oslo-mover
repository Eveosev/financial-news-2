Norway’s krone climbed to its
strongest level against the euro in more than a month after the
central bank today held the interest rate unchanged and
signalled it’s no longer considering a cut.  Norway’s krone appreciated as much as 1.1 percent against
the euro to 7.7847, the strongest level since Aug. 13, and
traded at 7.825 as of 12:21 p.m. in Oslo. It strengthened
against all major currencies except the South Korean won in a
17-member basket compiled by Bloomberg.  Norges Bank kept its key rate unchanged at 1.5 percent “as
widely expected and the rate path was lifted, excluding any
probability for a rate cut,” Erica Blomgren, an analyst at SEB
AB, said in an e-mailed note to clients. “The krone forecast
implies that the krone will, on average, strengthen by 1 percent
until year-end.”  Norges Bank has kept rates unchanged for more than a year
while signaling as recently as June that policy makers were
prepared to ease to prevent krone strength from undermining
their inflation targeting. Those efforts paid off last month as
underlying inflation surged to 2.5 percent, hitting the target
for the first time in four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
