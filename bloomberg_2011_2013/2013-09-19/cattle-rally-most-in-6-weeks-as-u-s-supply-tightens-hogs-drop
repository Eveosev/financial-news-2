Cattle futures rose, heading for
the biggest gain in six weeks, on signs of tightening U.S.
cattle supplies and improved beef exports. Hog prices fell.  Feedlots probably purchased or placed 8.3 percent fewer
cattle in August than they did in the same month last year,
according to the average estimates of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will release
inventory figures at 3 p.m. tomorrow. The number of animals
being added to the feedlot herd declined in May, June and July
from a year earlier, USDA data show.  “We’re getting evidence of a shortfall of available beef
from December through April,”  Rich Nelson , the chief strategist
at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois , said in a telephone
interview. “People have to be aware of winter shortages.”  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$1.298 a pound at 11:31 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
A close at that price would mark the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Aug. 8. The December contract has rallied
5.7 percent since touching a low of $1.22775 on May 20.  Feedlot operators typically buy year-old animals that weigh
500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The
cattle are fattened on corn for four to five months until they
weigh about 1,300 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Export sales of beef totaled 17,169 metric tons (37.85
million pounds) in the week ended Sept. 12, and sales in the
past four weeks are 26 percent above the year-earlier average,
according to USDA data.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement rose 0.5
percent to $1.5915 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.7 percent to
87.375 cents a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
