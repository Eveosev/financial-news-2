Airbus SAS (EAD)  is in discussions to
sell several hundred more A320neos in  China  after securing
commitments for the re-engined version of the single-aisle jet.  The planemaker is in an active sales campaign for A320neos
as the jet is popular among Chinese customers, Robin Tao, a
Beijing-based spokesman for Airbus, said by phone today. Airbus
secured order commitments for 100 neos from China, subject to
government approval, he said.  The planemaker won commitments for 20 planes from
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd .’s leasing arm, a deal
that was announced last year. Sixty are from  Air China Ltd. (601111) , out
of the 100 A320s it announced in May. The remaining 20 were from
a customer Tao didn’t identify because of a confidentiality
agreement.  China will need 5,580 new planes costing $780 billion
through 2032, Boeing Co. said earlier this month. Boeing will
boost plane deliveries to Chinese customers by 50 percent this
year to 120,  Randy Tinseth , vice president of marketing at the
Chicago-based planemaker, said Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
