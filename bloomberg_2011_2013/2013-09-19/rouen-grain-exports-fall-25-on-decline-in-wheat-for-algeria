Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen, Europe’s biggest wheat-shipping hub, fell 25 percent
in the most recent week as deliveries to  Algeria  declined and a
shipment to Cuba wasn’t repeated.  Total grain loaded for export fell to 135,680 metric tons
in the Sept. 12-18 period from 181,303 tons in the previous
week, the  Seine River port  wrote in an e-mailed report. Algeria
was the biggest destination, taking 53,000 tons of wheat,
compared with 102,350 tons of the cereal and 26,250 tons of
barley last week.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s soft-wheat
exports in 2012-13, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the North Sea, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
