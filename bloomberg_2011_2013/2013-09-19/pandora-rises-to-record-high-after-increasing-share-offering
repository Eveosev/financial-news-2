Pandora Media Inc. (P) , the biggest Web
radio service, rose to a record yesterday after pricing an
expanded stock offering that will finance plans to compete with
 radio stations  for advertisers.  Pandora advanced 6.7 percent to $27.35 at the close in  New
York , the highest price since the company first sold shares in
June 2011. The stock has almost tripled this year. Pandora,
based in Oakland,  California , said yesterday it will sell 13
million shares at $25 each, up from 10 million planned earlier.  With the sale, Pandora is raising an estimated $312.9
million, according to a regulatory filing, amid plans to open
sales offices and challenge radio stations for $15 billion in
local U.S. advertising. Last week Pandora named digital ad
veteran Brian McAndrews as chairman and chief executive officer.  The sum raised could increase to $378.8 million if
underwriters including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley
exercise a 30-day option to purchase 2.73 million more shares,
up from 2.1 million originally. The offering is expected to
close on Sept. 24, Pandora said.  Crosslink Capital Inc., the companyâ€™s biggest  shareholder ,
is selling 5.2 million shares in the offering, up from the 4
million initially proposed.  Some proceeds may be used for acquisitions and new
technology, according to the prospectus. Pandora said in a Sept.
16 prospectus that the stock sale would generate $231 million to
$280 million, depending on the over-allotment.  Songza and Raditaz, both closely held music applications,
are possible acquisition targets, Rich Tullo, an analyst at
Albert Fried & Co., wrote in a Sept. 16 report. Pandora could
also purchase businesses to build its ad-selling platform and
expand into films and books, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
