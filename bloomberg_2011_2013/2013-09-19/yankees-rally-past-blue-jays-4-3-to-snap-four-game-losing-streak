The  New York  Yankees overcame a
three-run deficit to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 4-3 and snap a
four-game losing streak.  Vernon Wells had a go-ahead two-run double at Rogers Centre
in Toronto last night to complete a four-run eighth inning, and
Mariano Rivera recorded his 44th save of the Major League
Baseball season as the Yankees improved to 80-72.  New York fell behind 3-0 in the fourth inning on a two-run
homer by Colby Rasmus and a solo shot by Ryan Goins. Robinson Cano had a run-scoring single and Alfonso Soriano’s double drove
in Curtis Granderson before Wells’s double in the eighth.  New York is tied with the  Kansas City Royals  for fifth
place in the American League wild-card standings. Each league
awards playoff spots to its two best teams that don’t win a
division title.  The Tampa Bay Rays (83-68) passed the  Texas Rangers  (82-69)
for the first wild-card spot with a 4-3 victory against Texas in
12 innings last night.  The  Cleveland Indians  (82-70) are third in the wild-card
standings after a 7-2 loss to the Royals. The Baltimore Orioles
(81-70), who beat the Boston Red Sox 5-3 in 12 innings, are a
half-game behind Cleveland, and the Yankees and Royals are an
additional 1 1/2 games back.  The  Atlanta Braves  moved within two games of sealing the
National League East title with a 5-2 win against the Washington
Nationals.  The Nationals are third in the NL wild-card standings with
an 81-71 record. The Pittsburgh Pirates (87-65), who lost 3-2 to
the San Diego Padres last night, hold the first wild-card spot,
with Cincinnati in second place with an 87-66 mark after a 6-5
win in 13 innings against the  Houston Astros  last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
