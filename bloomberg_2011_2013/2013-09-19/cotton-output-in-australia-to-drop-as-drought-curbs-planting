Cotton production in  Australia , the
world’s third-biggest exporter, may drop 9 percent this year as
drought curbs planting in Queensland state, the country’s
second-biggest grower, according to an industry group.  Farmers will pick about 4 million bales of 227 kilograms
(500 pounds) from an estimated 4.4 million bales in 2012-2013,
 Cotton Australia ’s Queensland policy manager  Michael Murray  said
by phone today. Sowing has started in central Queensland and is
moving south, he said.  The forecast compares with a prediction of 990,000 metric
tons (4.36 million bales) by the Australian Bureau Agricultural
and Resource Economics and Sciences. World production will drop
in 2013-2014 as the U.S., the biggest exporter, harvests its
smallest crop in four years, according to the Department of
Agriculture. Drought was declared in more than 60 percent of
Queensland, Australia’s second-biggest grower, after the state
suffered its fifth-driest August on record.  “Dryland will definitely be down if there is no good rain
between now and the close of the planting window” in mid to
late November, Murray said from Sydney today. “In the main
irrigation areas, we’re expecting a small reduction on last year,
but that could be rectified quite quickly if there’s some
reasonable rains.”  Dryland cotton refers to crops that are grown without
irrigated water and rely on rainfall.  Queensland has an equal chance of a  wetter  or drier-than-normal September to November, the Bureau of Meteorology says.
New South  Wales  is Australia’s biggest cotton producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
