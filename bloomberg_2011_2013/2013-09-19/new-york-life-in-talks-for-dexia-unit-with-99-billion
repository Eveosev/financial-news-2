New York  Life Insurance Co., the
largest policyholder-owned U.S. life insurer, is in talks to buy
a Dexia SA unit as part of an expansion in asset management.  The firms entered exclusive negotiations today after an
auction process, Dexia said in a statement that didn’t disclose
a purchase price. The unit has more than 73 billion euros ($99
billion) under management and operates in 25 countries including
Belgium, France and  Australia , according to its  website .  New York Life Chief Executive Officer Ted Mathas is among
insurance executives expanding in asset management to increase
fee income. His company struck a deal last year to take a stake
in Cornerstone Capital Management Inc.  “New York Life Investments constitutes a solid partner,”
the Paris- and Brussels-based company said in the statement.
“ Dexia (DEXB)  is confident in its execution capacities, should an
agreement be signed.”  Dexia is being wound down at the expense of French and
Belgian taxpayers. New York Life is rated AAA by Moody’s
Investors Service, the highest grade.  New York Life Investments had $388 billion in assets under
management as of July 31, according to the statement. The
business offers stocks, bonds and alternative investments to
institutional and retail clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
