Slovakia’s economy will  advance 
faster than projected this year, the  Finance Ministry  said,
citing improvement in the euro region and a pick-up in household
spending.  The ministry raised its 2013 growth forecast to 0.8
percent, from 0.5 percent projected in June, it said in an e-mailed statement from Bratislava. It kept the projection for
2014 unchanged at 2.2 percent and saw growth quickening to 2.9
percent in 2015.  The country is benefiting from the euro-area’s return to
growth after six quarters of declines. The rebound has fueled
demand for exports such as cars assembled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s
Slovak unit. A revival in household spending, driven by slowing
inflation and rising  consumer confidence , will also fuel the
faster expansion, the ministry said.  More rapid growth will make it easier for the country to
meet its target of reducing the fiscal shortfall below the EU’s
limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product as early as this
year. Prime Minister  Robert Fico  has said meeting the bloc’s
fiscal rules is a priority of his administration because he
wants to distance Slovakia from ailing euro-sharing nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
