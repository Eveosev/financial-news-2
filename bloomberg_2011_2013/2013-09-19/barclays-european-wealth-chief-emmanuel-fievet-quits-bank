Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-biggest bank by assets, said Emmanuel Fievet, head of  wealth
management  for the U.K. and Europe, has left the company and
will be replaced by Henry Fischel-Bock.  Fievet decided to leave after five years in senior
management roles, according to an internal company memo seen by
 Bloomberg News  and confirmed by the company. Fischel-Bock has
spent 30 years in the wealth management industry and joined
Barclays in 2010 from International Planning Group, a client-advisory firm in Miami.  David Semaya will retire after leading the private-banking
business in the U.K. and Ireland, according to the memo.  Fievet’s exit follows Stefanie Drews’s departure from the
helm of Barclays’s ultra-wealthy clients and family offices unit
in London, which the lender reported yesterday.  Patrick Ramsey ,
head of the bank’s Swiss unit, quit in July. Barclays, with
$201.4 billion of client assets, ranked 15th globally in a
benchmark of wealth managers published in July by Scorpio
Partnership, a London-based research company.  Barclays Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins , who took
over in August 2012, pledged in February to reduce expenses and
eliminate 3,700 jobs across the bank’s different businesses.  The cost-to-income ratio at Barclays’s wealth and
investment-management unit was 91 percent in the first half,
compared with 87 percent a year earlier, according to a July
investor  presentation .  An ultra-wealthy client is defined as a customer with at
least 50 million pounds ($80 million) to invest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
