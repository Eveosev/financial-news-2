Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures jumped
after the U.S. Federal Reserve refrained from paring its
economic stimulus program, prompting a surge in global equities.
Rupee forwards strengthened the most in a year.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for September delivery rose 2.9
percent to 6,109 at 9:22 a.m. in Singapore, heading for a four-month high. The underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index added 0.8 percent to
5,899.45 yesterday. The S&P BSE Sensex also rose 0.8 percent.
The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded
shares surged 4.1 percent, the most since Jan. 11. One-month
rupee forwards advanced 2.6 percent, the biggest increase since
Sept. 14, 2012.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index climbed to a four-month high
today after the Fed said yesterday that it wants to see more
evidence that improvement in the  U.S. economy  will be sustained
before adjusting the pace of its $85 billion in monthly
purchases of Treasury and mortgage debt. Concerns the Fed would
trim stimulus helped prompt a three-month, $3.7-billion  selloff 
from Indian stocks by international investors through August,
pushing the Sensex to an 11-month low.  Overseas investors  bought a net $55 million of domestic
shares on Sept. 17, data from the regulator showed yesterday,
extending September’s purchases to $1.09 billion, poised for
first month of net inflows since May.  The Sensex has increased 2.8 percent this year in local
currency terms and is  valued  at 13.9 times projected 12-month
earnings, compared with the five-year average of 14.1 times,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. It has lost 11 percent this
year in dollar terms. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index trades at
10.7 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
