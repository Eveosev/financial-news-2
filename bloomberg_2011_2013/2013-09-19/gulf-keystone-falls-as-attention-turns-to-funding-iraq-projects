Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)  fell
the most since July in  London  trading as attention turned from a
court victory last week to the scale of spending needed to
develop fields in  Iraq ’s Kurdistan region.  Shares dropped 8.2 percent to 200 pence, valuing the
Bermuda-based oil explorer at 1.8 billion pounds ($2.9 billion).  The explorer won a court case this month against a former
associate who claimed a stake in Gulf Keystone’s Shaikan
discovery, which sent the shares up 17 percent on Sept. 10.  Gulf Keystone plans to increase output at Shaikan to 40,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day by the end of the year and sees
output at as much as 150,000 barrels a day within three years,
an increase it says it can finance from its own  cash flow .  “This marks the end of the exuberance around the stock
after its court victory and the beginning of the next phase,”
said Charlie Sharp, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Securities
Ltd. in London. “The question is how they get from where they
will be in early 2014, at about 40,000 barrels a day, to their
next big target.”  The company plans to move up to London’s main stock listing
by the end of 2013. Its first half loss narrowed to $26.4
million from $31.4 million a year earlier.  “We think it’s unlikely the  40,000 barrels a day by year-end will be reached in time,” Jamal Orazbayeva, an analyst at
Westhouse Securities, said in a note. “We are mainly concerned
with general and administrative cash costs, interest payments
and the net debt position.”  The company said today that at least eight wells will need
to be drilled at Shaikan to get to 150,000 barrels. It will need
to build two additional oil-processing facilities that will cost
as much as $250 million each over 18 months.  “We’re turning the corner with production,” Chief
Executive Officer Todd Kozel said in a telephone interview.
“Gulf Keystone is in the strongest position it’s ever been
in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
