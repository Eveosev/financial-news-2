African cashew-nut producers could
triple revenue from exports in the next seven years by
increasing processing capacity and adding value to the crop,
according to the  African Cashew Alliance , an industry group.  The target is to process half of the continent’s cashew
crop locally by 2020 from about 10 percent of output currently,
Georgette Taraf, the alliance’s president, said on Sept. 17 in
an interview in Ghana’s capital, Accra.  Economies in  Africa  are seeking to remove bottlenecks
hindering growth in the manufacturing industry and help ramp up
the processing of raw goods before export. Value addition, as
it’s known, helps producers maximize returns and lessen the risk
of price fluctuations in commodity markets.  Ivory Coast, the top cashew-nut exporter in sub-Saharan
Africa, produces about 450,000 tons of the crop a year, followed
by Guinea Bissau at 150,000 tons and Tanzania at 140,000 tons,
Xenia Defontaine, public relations manager for the alliance,
said in an interview in Accra yesterday.  Other producers on the continent are  Benin , Nigeria,
Mozambique and Ghana, Kenya, Guinea,  Madagascar , Senegal and
Burkina Faso, according the Food and Agriculture Organization.  “In Ivory Coast, we target to process about half of our
entire cashew crop within three years,” Jean Claude Brou, the
country’s minister of industry and mines, said in an interview
on Sept. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
