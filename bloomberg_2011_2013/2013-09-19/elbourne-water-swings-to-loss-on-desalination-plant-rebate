Melbourne  Water Corp., the state
government-owned supplier to water retailers, swung to a loss as
it repaid A$310.8 million ($295 million) to customers it
overcharged amid delays to the construction of  Australia ’s
largest desalination plant.  The supplier had a net loss after tax of A$30.1 million in
the 12 months to June 30, from after tax profit of A$270 million
the previous year, when it collected payments to cover some
costs related to commissioning of the A$3.5 billion Wonthaggi
plant, it said today in its  annual report .  The “operating environment continues to provide
significant challenges to the business,” the report said.
“These include responding to the financial impacts of the
Victorian desalination plant.”  Melbourne Water scrapped plans to return payments to
customers over a five-year period on “strong community
feedback,” amid delays in construction of the reverse-osmosis
project in Wonthaggi, near Melbourne, which will eventually be
able to supply as much as 150 billion liters (40 billion
gallons) a year, it said in the statement.  The company held its prices at fiscal 2012 levels in the 12
months to June 30 and also offered a rebate. It said it’s now
considering how to pass on costs from the plant’s construction
from 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
