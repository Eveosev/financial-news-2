CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL) , Southeast Asia’s
biggest developer, said it will buy back some of its existing
convertible bonds with proceeds from a new note.  The company will be issuing S$600 million of new
convertible securities, while redeeming its convertible bonds
due in 2016 and 2018, according to a statement to the Singapore
stock exchange today.  CapitaLand is making the offer “to reduce the principal
amount of the outstanding indebtedness and ongoing debt service
obligations,” it said in the statement.  The company issued S$650 million of 1.85 percent
convertible notes in May.  Convertible bonds contain a provision that permits
conversion to the issuer’s common stock at some fixed exchange
ratio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
