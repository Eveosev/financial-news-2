Royal Bank of Scotland Plc  branches
and other office buildings were offered for sale by Telereal
Trillium, the unit of William Pears Group of Cos. that owns the
assets. The asking price is 550 million pounds ($882 million).  The Hyperion portfolio consists of 55 assets, most of which
are leased to RBS, Telereal Trillium said in a statement today.
The company hired  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)  to sell the buildings, which
also include Coutts & Co.’s London office.  “With conditions in the financial and property markets
improving, the appetite for this type of high-quality property
investment has grown significantly,” Graeme Hunter, Telereal
Trillium’s group property director, said in the statement.  Investors are selling real estate as values recover in the
wake of the financial crisis. Monthly commercial property total
returns rose to 0.9 percent in August, the highest since March
2011, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
