Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
 Topix (TPX)  index advancing to an eight-week high, after the Federal
Reserve unexpectedly refrained from cutting stimulus.  The Topix gained 1 percent to 1,205.36 as of 9:02 a.m. in
 Tokyo , headed for its highest close since July 24. All 33 of the
gauge’s industry groups climbed.The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
increased 1.2 percent to 14,673.46. Shares rallied even after
the yen touched a three-week high to the dollar.  “The market has been generally surprised and if you take
everything in its entirety, this is probably as dovish as we can
get” from the Fed, said Chris Weston, chief market strategist
at IG Markets Ltd. in  Melbourne . “This is another reason to be
long on equities right now. You’re just given a green light by
the Fed to continue to buy.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The measure surged to a record yesterday, after Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his policy-making colleagues
maintained the $85 billion pace of monthly bond buying. The Fed
said it needs more evidence of lasting improvement in the
economy and warned that an increase in interest rates threatened
to curb the expansion. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had
predicted a $5 billion cut to Treasury purchases.  The central bank said its target interest rate will remain
near zero “at least as long as” unemployment exceeds 6.5
percent, provided the outlook for inflation is no higher than
2.5 percent. The jobless rate was at 7.3 percent in  August. (USURTOT)   The Topix rose 39 percent this year through yesterday,
making Japanese equities the best performers among developed
markets. The gauge  traded  at 1.25 times book value yesterday,
compared with 2.54 for the S&P 500 and 1.76 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. The Japanese measure’s 30-day historic  volatility  was
