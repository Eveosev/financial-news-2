German stocks advanced, sending the
benchmark DAX Index to a record, after the Federal Reserve
refrained from paring its bond purchases.  The DAX Index gained 1.2 percent to 8,736 at 9:11 a.m. in
Frankfurt, its highest level since inception. The broader HDAX
Index rose 1.1 percent.  The DAX is heading for its third weekly rally, its longest
streak since May, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first hinted
that the central bank may consider paring stimulus if the
economy improves considerably.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
