Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta
rejected Silvio Berlusconi’s assertion that the judiciary was
being manipulated by his political opponents and that the rule
of law was no longer assured.  “The rule of law exists in  Italy ,” Letta said today in a
press conference in  Rome  when asked about Berlusconi’s critique
yesterday of the judiciary. “There aren’t any persecutions in
Italy. And above all, in Italy we respect the autonomy of the
judiciary and the work of judges.”  Letta, 47, has sidestepped confrontation as Berlusconi’s
guilty verdicts accumulated and his protest against the
judiciary intensified. Yesterday, the 76-year-old Berlusconi, a
billionaire and three-time premier, said the judiciary “leaves
its mark on the live flesh of millions of Italians every day.”  The ruling parliamentary coalition is in turmoil as
Berlusconi’s conviction for  tax fraud  places the ex-premier at
risk of expulsion from the Senate. As Letta declines to get
involved, lawmakers in the premier’s  Democratic Party  are
pushing for Berlusconi’s ouster. Letta said today that his
government will push forward with its agenda, and when the time
comes he will know how to handle disputes within his alliance.  “I want to tell everyone that I don’t have naïf written on
my forehead,” Letta said, comparing himself to “ Jo Condor ,”
the protagonist of a 1970s animated television commercial for
Nutella hazelnut spread. “I learned as much as a child, and at
the right time I’ll demonstrate it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
