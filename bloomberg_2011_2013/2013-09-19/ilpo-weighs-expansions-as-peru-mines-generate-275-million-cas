Cia. Minera Milpo SA, the Peruvian
zinc, lead and copper producer, has more than $275 million in
cash ready to invest in mine projects and possible acquisitions,
Chief Executive Officer Victor Gobitz said.  The company based in Lima is looking into an expansion of
Cerro Lindo, the largest of its three mines in the country, and
is evaluating investing in five other projects including one in
 Chile , Gobitz said in an interview in Arequipa today.  “The three operations are generating positive  cash flow ,”
Gobitz said. “This money will be used when we define which
projects in our portfolio we develop or possibly if an
acquisition opportunity arises.”  Peru’s third largest zinc producer is preparing to expand
as its existing mines operate at full capacity, producing 25,000
metric tons a day. Output probably will remain at that level
through next year, he said. The unit of Sao Paulo-based
Votorantim Metais plans “marginal investments” in the next two
years to boost output and lower costs at existing mines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
