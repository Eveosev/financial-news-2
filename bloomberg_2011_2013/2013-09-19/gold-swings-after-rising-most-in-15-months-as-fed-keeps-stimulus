Gold rose to a one-week high in
London after the  Federal Reserve  maintained the pace of U.S.
bond purchases, boosting demand for the metal as a store of
value. Silver and palladium advanced.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said it will “await more
evidence” for sustained economic recovery before reducing its
$85 billion in monthly stimulus. Gold has dropped 18 percent
this year on speculation that the Fed would taper debt purchases
that helped the metal cap a 12-year bull run in 2012.  “This came as a complete surprise to many market
participants and we are seeing prices move higher,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The trend is
bullish.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.2 percent to settle at
$1,366.36 an ounce at 4:59 p.m. in  New York . Earlier, the price
reached $1,375.81, the highest since Sept. 10. Yesterday, the
metal surged 4.1 percent, the most in 15 months.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for December
delivery rose 4.7 percent to close at $1,369.30, the biggest
gain since March 19, 2009. Yesterday, the price settled 0.1
percent lower before the Fed announcement.  Goldman Outlook  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the Fed’s decision “leaves
risks to  gold prices  as skewed to the upside in the near term.”
The bank affirmed its forecast that prices will resume a drop
into 2014 on U.S. economic growth and less accommodative
monetary policy, analysts Damien Courvalin and  Jeffrey Currie 
said in a note dated yesterday.  Analysts were divided on the amount by which policy makers
would scale back monthly asset purchases. Among 64 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before the announcement, 33 predicted
the Fed would reduce buying of Treasuries by $5 billion or less,
while 31 forecast a cut of $10 billion or more.  Spot gold, which reached a record $1,921.15 on Sept. 6,
2011, surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to June
2011 as the Fed pumped more than $2 trillion into the financial
system by purchasing debt. The price fell 14 percent in two days
through April 15, the biggest drop since 1983, as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value. The rout spurred
coin and jewelry demand from the U.S. to  China .  Silver for immediate delivery rose 0.5 percent to $23.072
an ounce. Yesterday, the price soared 5.6 percent.  Spot palladium jumped 2.2 percent to $734.45 an ounce. The
price climbed for the fifth straight session, the longest rally
in two months.  Platinum fell 0.1 percent to $1,463.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
