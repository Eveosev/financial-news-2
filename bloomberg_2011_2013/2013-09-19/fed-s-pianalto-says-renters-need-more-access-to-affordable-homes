Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
President  Sandra Pianalto  said access to affordable rental
housing programs should be expanded and simplified.  “For too many families, finding affordable rental
properties in desirable neighborhoods remains difficult,”
Pianalto, who has a vote on policy next year, said today in the
text of remarks prepared for delivery at a conference on housing
and inequality at the Cleveland Fed. The reserve bank said in an
e-mailed statement last month that Pianalto will retire early in
2014, without specifying the date.  Pianalto, 59, is the longest serving of the Fed’s 12
regional presidents, having become leader of the Cleveland Fed
in 2003. She joined the Cleveland Fed in 1983 as an economist in
the research department after working as an economist at the
Fed’s Board of Governors in  Washington .  To contact the reporters on this story:
