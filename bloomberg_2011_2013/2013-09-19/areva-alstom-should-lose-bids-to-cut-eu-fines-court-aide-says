Areva SA (AREVA)  and  Alstom SA (SU)  should lose
bids to get further reductions to EU antitrust fines levied for
colluding on electrical-equipment pricing, an adviser to the
EU’s top court said today.  Advocate General Paolo Mengozzi of the EU Court of Justice
today said in a non-binding opinion Areva and Alstom should lose
their appeals to further cut fines. In 2011, the companies won a
cut to a joint fine to 48.2 million euros ($65.4 million) from
53.5 million euros. A separate fine for Alstom was cut from 11.5
million euros to 10.3 million euros.  The European Commission, the EU’s antitrust regulator,
fined 10 companies, including  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , a total of 750.7
million euros in January 2007 for fixing prices and carving up
the market for gas-insulated switchgear, used to control
electricity flow. Munich, Germany-based Siemens received the
largest fine of 396.6 million euros for the cartel. The
company’s appeal of that fine is pending at the EU top court.  Alstom and Areva representatives didn’t immediately return
calls seeking comment.  In a separate appeal, the EU court adviser today sided with
a  Siemens AG (SIE)  unit, Siemens Transmission & Distribution SA,
saying it shouldn’t be liable for paying part of a 4.5 million
euro-fine.  The cases are: C-231/11 P, C-232/11 P, C-233/11 P, C-247/11
P, C-253/11 P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
