West Texas Intermediate climbed to
the highest level in a week after the  Federal Reserve  said it
will maintain monthly bond purchases to stimulate economic
growth in the U.S., the world’s biggest oil consumer.  Futures advanced as much as 0.9 percent after rising the
most in more than three weeks yesterday. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  said it will continue buying $85 billion in securities
each month. U.S. crude stockpiles fell to the lowest level since
March 2012, and inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for WTI contracts, dropped for an 11th week, according to
a government report yesterday.  “Completely reversing the tapering policy was a major
surprise,” said Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at
Marex Spectron Group in London. “In the short-term this is more
positive than negative as tapering was a de facto monetary
tightening. Longer term, the picture is less positive.”  WTI for October delivery, which expires tomorrow, gained as
much as 92 cents to $108.99 a barrel in electronic trading on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest since Sept. 12,
and was at $108.74 as of 12:27 p.m. London time. It surged 2.5
percent yesterday, the biggest increase since Aug. 27. The
volume of all futures traded was about 18 percent less than the
100-day average. The more active November contract was up 61
cents at $107.89.  Brent for November settlement rose as much as 66 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $111.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark crude was at a premium
of $2.98 to WTI for the same month. The spread shrank for a
third day yesterday to $3.32, the narrowest since Aug. 19.  Borrowing Costs  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his colleagues refrained
from paring stimulus as rising borrowing costs show signs of
slowing the four-year expansion. Treasury yields have jumped
since May, when Bernanke first outlined a possible timetable for
a reduction in the asset purchases that have swelled the Fed’s
balance sheet to $3.66 trillion.  There’s “no fixed calendar schedule” for tapering, he
said yesterday in  Washington  after the two-day FOMC meeting,
signaling the central bank may act later this year.  “News of the Fed refraining from tapering comes at the
same time as relatively low spare capacity and relatively low
crude and product stocks,” Miswin Mahesh, a commodities analyst
at Barclays Plc in London, said in an e-mailed report today.
“U.S. oil-demand growth has exceeded consensus expectations
this year.”  Crude Stockpiles  U.S.  crude inventories  slid by 4.37 million barrels to
355.6 million in the week ended Sept. 13, the Energy Information
Administration reported yesterday. Supplies were projected to
decrease by 1.2 million, according to the median estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Stockpiles at Cushing, the largest U.S. oil-storage hub,
declined by 861,000 barrels to 33.3 million, said the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm. That’s the lowest level
since February 2012.  Distillate supplies, a category that includes heating oil
and diesel, dropped by 1.08 million, compared with a predicted
500,000 barrel gain.  Gasoline inventories  fell by 1.63 million
barrels last week, the data show. They were forecast to climb by
500,000 barrels, according to the survey.  Refineries operated at 92.5 percent of capacity, unchanged
from the prior week. Plants are often idled in September and
October for maintenance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
