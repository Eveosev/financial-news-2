Gasoline fell on concern that the
 Federal Reserve ’s decision to leave intact its level of bond
buying indicates the  U.S. economy  will continue to struggle,
reducing fuel consumption.  Futures sank as much as 0.8 percent. The Fed said it wanted
to see evidence that economic gains could be sustained before
reducing the pace of asset purchases. Prices also fell on
speculation that a jump in wholesale gasoline deliveries last
week were caused by exports that were higher than estimated by
the Energy Information Administration and aren’t an indication
of stronger demand.  “If things look really bad, how does that show better
demand for energy?” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker
at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . ‘People are
writing off the demand increase as either a one-week anomaly or
basic export demand and not domestic demand.’’  Gasoline for October delivery fell 1.94 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.7227 a gallon at 10:15 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 19 percent above the
100-day average.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday he was
“somewhat concerned” by the impact of rising bond yields on
the economy and wanted to “wait a bit longer and to try to get
confirming evidence” that the economy is showing signs of
lasting improvement.  Weaker Economy  “If the economy is weaker than we think, that’s going to
hurt demand,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “Yesterday’s announcement was a
double-edged sword. It said the economy is not strong enough and
that the Fed has got your back.”  The Energy Information Administration reported that
gasoline  consumption  jumped 4.9 percent to 9.02 million barrels
a day, after sliding 5.4 percent the prior week. Demand over
four weeks was 0.5 percent above a year earlier. Gasoline
 inventories  dropped for the fifth time in six weeks in the week
ended Sept. 13.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 56 cents to $6.54 a barrel. The
fuel’s  premium  over Brent gained 10 cents to $4.03.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 1.2 cents to $3.494
a gallon, 36 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA
said today on its website. Prices have fallen 17 consecutive
days to the lowest level since July 8.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery fell 0.91
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $3.0314 a gallon on trading volume that
was 0.3 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI slipped 8 cents to $19.55 a
barrel. The  premium  over Brent rose 63 cents to $17.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
