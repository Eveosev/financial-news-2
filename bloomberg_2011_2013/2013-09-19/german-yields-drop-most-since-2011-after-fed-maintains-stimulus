German bonds led European
 government securities  higher after the U.S. Federal Reserve
unexpectedly refrained from reducing the pace of its asset
purchases, boosting demand for fixed-income securities.  Ten-year bund yields slid to a the lowest since August as
stocks jumped after Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed must
determine its policies based on the economy even if it surprises
markets. French 10-year yields dropped to five-week low. Spanish
bonds rallied for a fourth day as the nation’s borrowing costs
fell at a 3.08 billion euros ($4.17 billion) debt sale.
 Portugal ’s bonds underperformed all the region’s debt markets as
 Standard & Poor’s  said it may cut the nation’s credit rating.  “The Fed was dovish,” said  Christoph Rieger , head of
fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “Bunds will
lead the rally initially, but with the Fed risk out of the way
the outlook for spreads is improving.”  German 10-year yields declined seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.93 percent at 4:30 p.m.  London  time after
reaching 1.85 percent, the  lowest  since Aug. 30. The 2 percent
bund maturing in August 2023 rose 0.655, or 6.55 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 100.65.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks climbed 1
percent, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index rallied 0.5 percent.  The Fed yesterday maintained its monthly purchases of $85
billion of bonds and mortgage-backed debt, saying it needs more
evidence of an improvement in the  U.S. economy . Analysts had
forecast policy makers would cut Treasury purchases by $5
billion to $40 billion.  Yields Slide  The rate on  French (GFRN10)  10-year bonds dropped nine basis points
to 2.42 percent, after reaching 2.34 percent, the lowest since
Aug. 15. The yield on similar-maturity Dutch securities slid
seven basis points to 2.29 percent. Belgian 10-year yields
declined eight basis points to 2.71 percent.  “We expect a lot of volatility in the coming months until
the Fed clearly communicates how it will reduce the bond
buying,” said Christian Reicherter, an analyst at DZ Bank AG in
Frankfurt. “We don’t think it will be a sustained move down in
yields. In a few days the discussion will be begin about if the
Fed will start tapering in December.”  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Belgium and  Finland ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  France  sold 3.05 billion euros of five-year notes at an
average yield of 1.23 percent, compared with 1.09 percent at a
previous auction on July 18. It also sold 2.53 billion euros of
two-year securities at 0.39 percent and 1.92 billion euros of
2016 debt to yield 0.43 percent.  Spanish Auctions  Spain ’s borrowing costs dropped as it allotted 2.06 billion
euros of three-year notes at an average yield of 2.225 percent,
compared with 2.636 percent at a previous sale on Aug. 1. The
Madrid-based Treasury also sold 1.02 billion euros of 15-year
bonds at 4.809 percent.  The Spanish auctions resulted in a “positive set of
results as exemplified by the notable decline yield relative to
previous sales,”  Richard McGuire , senior fixed-income
strategist at Rabobank International in London, wrote in a note
to clients. “Given the shot in the arm for risk appetite in the
form of the Fed’s surprising decision to stand pat yesterday,
these positive results were perhaps to be expected.”  Spanish 10-year yields fell eight basis points to 4.32
percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Italian bonds
declined 11 basis points to 4.29 percent.  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold
Spain’s 10-year bonds instead of German bunds widened five basis
points to 245 basis points after dropping to 235, the narrowest
since July 1, 2011.  Portugal’s BB long-term credit rating may be cut if the
government fails to meet its budget deficit goals and implement
reforms, S&P said yesterday. It raised the risk of a downgrade
on the country by putting it on “creditwatch” with a negative
outlook. The nation’s 10-year bond yield fell two basis points
to 7.16 percent.  German securities lost 2.7 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy’s
returned 3.8 percent and Spain’s earned 8.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
