Rite Aid Corp. (RAD) , the third-largest
U.S. drugstore chain, climbed to the highest in almost six years
after raising its profit forecast because of increasing sales at
remodeled stores.  The shares rose 23 percent to $4.58 in New York, the
highest closing price since Sept. 28, 2007. Rite Aid has more
than tripled this year, compared with a 21 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Net income in the year through February will be as much as
27 cents a share, up from a previous estimate of a maximum of 16
cents, the  Camp Hill , Pennsylvania-based company said today in a
statement. The average of three analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was 13 cents.  Chief Executive Officer John Standley has remodeled 1,019
of Rite Aid’s more than 4,600 stores into so-called wellness
centers with expanded pharmacy services and health-focused
products. Same-store non-pharmacy sales at wellness centers
increased, compared with a drop at the old-format stores, and
prescription sales at the revamped locations grew faster as
well.  Net income in the quarter ended Aug. 31 was $32.8 million,
or 3 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $38.8 million,
or 5 cents, a year earlier, the company said. The average
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a loss
of 4 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
