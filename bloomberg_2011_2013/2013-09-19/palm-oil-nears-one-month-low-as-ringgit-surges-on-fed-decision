Palm oil traded near a one-month
low after the U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly refrained from
cutting stimulus, spurring a rally in the Malaysian currency
that lowered the appeal of ringgit-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in December declined as much as
1.1 percent to 2,296 ringgit ($727) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, and was at 2,305 ringgit at 11:44 a.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures touched 2,294 ringgit on Sept. 17, the
lowest price for the most-active contract since Aug. 20. Palm
oil for physical delivery in October was at 2,350 ringgit
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee said it wants to
see more evidence of a recovery in the world’s largest economy
before adjusting the pace of its $85 billion in monthly
purchases of Treasury and mortgage debt. The Malaysian ringgit
surged the most in three years after the decision.  “There is uncertainty in demand” with the volatility in
currencies, said Donny Khor, deputy director of futures and
commodities at RHB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“Exports will be more expensive. In the coming month,
production will be huge, and that has been more or less factored
into the market.”  Output climbed to 1.74 million tons in August, the highest
level since December, according to data from the Malaysian Palm
Oil Board. Production is typically highest between July and
October each year.  Exports from  Indonesia , the largest producer, fell to 1.48
million tons in August from 1.59 million tons a month earlier,
the country’s palm oil association said today. Estimates were
for 1.58 million tons, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Soybeans for November gained 0.5 percent to $13.54 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for December delivery
climbed 0.5 percent to 42.94 cents a pound. Financial markets in
 China  are closed for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
