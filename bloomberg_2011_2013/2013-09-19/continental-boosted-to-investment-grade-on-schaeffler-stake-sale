Continental AG (CON) ,  Europe ’s second-largest auto-parts maker, was upgraded to investment grade
status by Moody’s Investors Service following the reduction of
Schaeffler AG’s stake in the company.  Moody’s lifted Hanover, Germany-based Continental’s credit
rating one level to Baa3, the lowest investment-grade ranking,
the ratings firm said in a report today. Bearings manufacturer
Schaeffler and its holding company Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH
raised about 950 million euros ($1.3 billion) this week by
selling a combined 4 percent holding in Continental, reducing
its stake to 46 percent.  “Throughout this year, Continental has exhibited strong
credit metrics that are commensurate with investment-grade
rating levels on a standalone basis,” Falk Frey, a Moody’s
analyst in  Frankfurt , wrote in the report. “The upgrade to Baa3
was prompted by a further slight weakening in the link with 
Schaeffler.”  Continental’s  rating  was dragged down to junk by debt-laden
Schaeffler’s stake that was bought as part of a failed takeover
attempt during the credit crisis. The tiremaker raised 2.3
billion euros from bond sales this year as it refinances
existing notes that pay higher interest. The company last issued
securities on Sept. 12 that were priced to yield 2.625 percent,
