Takahide Kiuchi, the Bank of  Japan 
board member most openly critical of its monetary policy, said
the central bank may come under pressure to expand unprecedented
easing, doing more harm than good to the economy.  “At this point, under the current commitment, I can’t deny
the possibility that the Bank of Japan will be influenced by
external factors such as market expectations and will be forced
to respond in such a way,” Kiuchi said today in a  speech  in
Hokkaido, northern Japan.  Kiuchi, 49, has consistently proposed since Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda’s first meeting in April that the BOJ shouldn’t
aim to achieve its 2 percent inflation target in two years. He
warned today of the potential adverse impact on the nation’s
economy of an expansion of monetary stimulus.  “If the current large-scale easing is prolonged or
strengthened, I fear the chances will rise that the side effects
will exceed the positive effects,” said the former chief Japan
economist at Nomura Holdings Inc.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said today
there is no need to rush in seeking fresh monetary easing to
counter the effects of a planned sales-tax increase in April.  Kuroda said earlier this month that the central bank could
take measures should the chances of achieving the 2 percent
inflation target recede.  To contact the reporters on this story:
