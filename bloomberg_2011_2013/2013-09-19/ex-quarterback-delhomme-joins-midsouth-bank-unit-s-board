Jake Delhomme, the former National
Football League quarterback who led the Carolina Panthers to the
Super Bowl, joined the board of directors at  MidSouth Bancorp (MSL) ’s
banking subsidiary.  Delhomme, 38, who also played for the New Orleans Saints,
Cleveland Browns and Houston Texans, has been an advisory board
member at MidSouth Bank since May 2012, the Lafayette,
Louisiana-based company said today in a statement. He now raises
thoroughbred race horses and serves on the director’s loan
committee, which provides insight “as an owner” in managing
credit, interest rates, liquidity, compliance and reputational
risk, the lender said.  The Saints signed Delhomme as a free agent in 1997 at the
start of his 14-year NFL career, according the statement. He
moved to the Panthers in 2003 and was starting quarterback until
2009,MidSouth said. Delhomme played for the  Cleveland Browns 
starting in 2010 and was a back-up quarterback for the Houston
Texans in 2011, according to the statement.  “He has mentored young bankers, instilling a strong work
ethic in them, and in turn has been mentored by our veteran
board members, which is among the many reasons the bank wanted
to formalize his association with the board,” MidSouth Bank
Chairman Will Charbonnet said in the statement.  The Panthers lost 32-29 to the New England Patriots in the
final seconds of the Super Bowl, in a game played after the 2003
season.  MidSouth Bancorp held $1.9 billion in assets as of June 30,
with about 60 outlets in Louisiana and  Texas , according to the
lender’s  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
