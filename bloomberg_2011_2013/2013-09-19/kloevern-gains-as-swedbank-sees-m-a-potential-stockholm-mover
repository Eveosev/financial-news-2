Kloevern AB (KLOV)  gained the most in
almost five months in Stockholm trading after Swedbank AB
upgraded the real estate company to strong buy from buy, citing
the potential for mergers and acquisitions in the industry.  The shares advanced as much as 4.6 percent to 27.3 kronor,
their steepest intraday gain since April 25. Kloevern rose 4.2
percent to 27.2 kronor as of 1:32 p.m. local time while the OMX
All-Share Index added 1 percent. The volume traded was more than
four times the daily average in the past three months.  Consolidation in the Swedish real estate industry should
support income from property management and profit from property
development, Niclas Hoglund, an analyst at Swedbank in
 Stockholm , wrote in a note to clients today.  “Strong cash flow bodes well for acquisitions in
general,” Hoglund wrote. He kept his share price estimate for
Kloevern’s shares at 32 kronor per share.  Of the 10 analysts who cover Stockholm-based  Kloevern  and
share their ratings with Bloomberg, four advise clients to buy
the shares while two have hold ratings and four have sell
recommendations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
