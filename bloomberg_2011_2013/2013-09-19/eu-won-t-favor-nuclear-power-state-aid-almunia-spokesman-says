The European Union denied reports
it has plans to encourage nuclear-power aid as it weighs whether
to include specific provisions to assess this type of energy
support in future guidelines.  “Contrary to media reports, the European Commission has no
plans to encourage state aid for nuclear power or to make it
easier for member states to grant such aid,” Antoine Colombani,
EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia’s spokesman, said
today in a  blog post . “Each member state is free to define the
role it intends to give (or not to give) to nuclear power in its
energy mix.”  Germany  has embarked on a plan to phase out nuclear power
by 2022 while the U.K. is in talks with  Electricite de France SA 
over moves to build two new nuclear reactors.  The commission will seek views later this year before
adopting energy-aid guidelines in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
