The United Nations Security Council
“must be prepared to act next week” to pass a resolution
requiring President Bashar al-Assad’s regime to abide by terms
of the U.S.-Russian agreement on the elimination of  Syria ’s
chemical weapons, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said.  Kerry told reporters in Washington today that it is “vital
for the international community to stand up and speak out about
the importance of enforceable action to rid the world” of
Syria’s chemical arsenal. He called on the Security Council to
act on a resolution next week, when the UN General Assembly will
be meeting.  He called for “a binding resolution that codifies the
strongest possible mechanism to achieve the goal and to achieve
it rapidly.”  “It is important that we accomplish the goal in New York
and that we accomplish it as quickly as possible,” said Kerry.  He also said there’s “clear and compelling evidence” that
Assad’s regime was responsible for a chemical-weapons attack
near Damascus on Aug. 21. Assad’s regime and Russian officials
have blamed the Syrian opposition for the attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
