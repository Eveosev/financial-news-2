Hungary’s bond yields plunged to
the lowest level in two months after the U.S. Federal Reserve
unexpectedly refrained from reducing the monetary stimulus that
supported demand for riskier assets.  Yields on the government’s 10-year forint bonds slid 17
basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 5.75 percent, the
lowest since July 19, at 4:57 p.m. in Budapest. The forint
traded at 296.81 per euro, after advancing to as high as 294.52,
0.8 percent stronger than three days ago, and paring the drop
this quarter to 0.6 percent.  The Fed said it wants more evidence of an economic recovery
before paring its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program,
surprising analysts who predicted a $5 billion cut to Treasury
purchases. Hungarian local-currency bonds returned 60 percent
since the Fed cut its main interest rate to as low as zero and
shifted its focus to debt purchases on Dec. 16, 2008, the most
among 26 sovereign indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  “We are expecting renewed hunt for yield, which will
increase demand for longer-dated forint bonds,”  Akos Kuti ,
Budapest-based head of research at broker Equilor Befektetesi
Zrt., wrote in a research report today. “We are also expecting
the forint to gain.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
