Palm oil shipments from  Indonesia ,
the world’s largest producer, dropped for a third straight month
in August to the lowest level since October 2012 as higher
supplies of substitute cooking oils reduced demand.  Sales fell 7 percent to 1.48 million metric tons from 1.59
million tons in July, said the Indonesian Palm Oil Association.
That’s the least since 1.42 million tons shipped in October and
compares with 1.41 million in August 2012, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The median of estimates in a survey published
Sept. 17 was for a 0.6 percent drop to 1.58 million tons.  Prices are heading for a third year of decline as slowing
growth in  China  and the European Union hurt demand for the
vegetable oil, used in everything from candy to biofuel.
Stockpiles are set to expand as domestic production accelerates
in the second half because of growing cycles. While global
output will increase from a year earlier, growth in consumption
may slow because of rising competition from sunflower and
soybean oil, according to Hamburg-based researcher Oil World.  “Harvests of rapeseed and sunflower seeds in the U.S. have
drastically cut demand for palm oil,” the association known as
Gapki said in an e-mail. Consumption declined in the Europe
Union and some Asian countries as well, said the group.  World supplies of rapeseed may climb to a record as
production increases from  Canada  to the European Union, Oil
World said Sept. 17. Palm oil production may be 58.85 million
tons in the season that begins Oct. 1, compared with 56.06
million tons a year earlier, Oil World said. Demand is expected
to rise to 58.18 million tons from 55.55 million tons, it said.  Shipments slumped 69 percent to 18,410 tons to the U.S.
from July and fell 3 percent to 359,230 tons to EU countries,
Gapki data showed. Imports by  Bangladesh  declined 58 percent and
by  Pakistan  were 41.5 percent lower.  India , the world’s largest
importer, bought 349,690 tons last month, up 1 percent, while
China’s purchases rose 8 percent to 170,300 tons.  Palm oil for delivery in December traded at 2,319 ringgit
($736) per ton on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives by 5 p.m. in Kuala
Lumpur today. That’s a 42 percent plunge for futures from an
almost three-year high of 3,967 ringgit in February 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
