The following is the text of the
Philadelphia area manufacturing activity from the  Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia .  Manufacturing activity picked up in September, according to firms responding to
this month’s Business Outlook Survey.   The survey’s broadest indicators for
general activity, new orders, shipments, and employment were all positive and
higher than in August.  The survey’s indicators of future activity were
significantly higher, suggesting improved optimism about growth over the next
six months.  Indicators Suggest Expansion  The survey’s broadest measure of manufacturing conditions, the diffusion index
of current activity, increased from 9.3 in August to 22.3 this month (see
Chart).  The index has now been positive for four consecutive months and is at
its highest reading since March 2011. The percentage of firms reporting
increased activity this month (36 percent) was greater than the percentage
reporting decreased activity (14 percent).  The demand for manufactured goods, as measured by the current new orders index,
increased 16 points, to 21.2.  Shipments rebounded from last month: The current
shipments index increased 22 points.  The diffusion indexes also suggest that,
on balance, inventories and deliveries were near steady this month, while
unfilled orders increased slightly.  Labor market indicators showed improvement this month. The current employment
index increased 7 points, to 10.3, its highest reading since April of last year.
The percentage of firms reporting increases in employment (21 percent) exceeded
the percentage reporting decreases (10 percent). Firms also reported a longer
average workweek compared with last month, and the index increased 15 points, to
12.2.     Price Indexes Suggest Moderate Pressures  The indexes for prices paid for purchased inputs and for prices received for
respondents’ own manufactured goods moved higher this month. The prices received
index increased 3 points, to 12.7, but the increase was attributable to fewer
firms reporting lower prices rather than more firms reporting price increases.
With respect to their purchased inputs, the percentage of firms reporting higher
prices increased from 24 percent last month to 32 percent this month.  The
prices paid index increased 8 points, to 25.3, its highest reading in 10 months.  Six-Month Indicators Improve  The survey’s future indicators suggest markedly improved optimism among the
reporting manufacturers. The future general activity index increased from 38.9
to 58.2, exceeding its previous highs since the end of the recession in 2009
(see Chart).  Slightly over 58 percent of firms expect increases in activity
over the next six months; no firms indicated that they expect decreases over the
next six months. The indexes for future new orders and shipments also improved,
rising 23 and 18 points, respectively.  The future employment index also
increased 9 points.  Over 37 percent of the firms expect to increase employment
over the next six months.  In supplemental questions, firms were asked to estimate their total production
growth for the third quarter ending this month and expected growth for the
fourth quarter (see Special Questions). Firms forecasting increases in third
quarter production (56 percent) exceeded those forecasting decreases (29
percent). The calculated average production growth rate for the reporting group
was an expected increase of nearly 1.6 percent. With regard to the fourth
quarter, the percentage of firms expecting acceleration in the rate of their
production growth (44 percent) was greater than the percentage expecting
deceleration in growth (30 percent).  Summary   According to respondents to the September Business Outlook Survey, the region’s
manufacturing sector continued to grow this month. All the broad indicators were
positive, with firms reporting a pickup in general activity, new orders,
shipments, and hiring. Price pressures were slightly more widespread this month,
with more firms reporting higher prices for their purchased inputs.  Firms’
outlook showed notable improvement this month, with a majority of firms now
expecting to expand manufacturing activity over the next six months and
one-third that expect to add workers.  Special Questions (September 2013)  1.  How will your firm’s total production for the third quarter compare with
