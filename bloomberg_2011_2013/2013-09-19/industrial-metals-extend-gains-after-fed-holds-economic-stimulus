Copper advanced for a second day as
industrial metals rose after stockpiles declined and the  Federal
Reserve  unexpectedly refrained from cutting economic stimulus.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange climbed as much as 1.7 percent to $7,305 a metric ton,
the highest level since Aug. 28, and was at $7,299.50 at 9:28
a.m. in Tokyo. Futures for delivery in December rose 1.5 percent
to $3.3265 a pound on the Comex in New York.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said that it wants to see
more evidence that improvement in the  U.S. economy  will be
sustained before adjusting the pace of its $85 billion in
monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage debt. Analysts had
predicted a $5 billion reduction, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The FOMC’s decision was a surprise to all markets,” said
 Tetsu Emori , the chief  fund manager  at Astmax Asset Management
Inc. in Tokyo. Copper was also supported by declining
stockpiles, he said.  Copper  stockpiles  monitored by the LME fell for the 10th
straight session. They have dropped 5.3 percent since Sept. 4.
Inventories monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell
5,816 tons to 151,978 tons this week, according to weekly data
posted yesterday on the bourse’s website.  Markets in China will be closed today and tomorrow for the
Mid-Autumn Festival holidays.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc, nickel, tin and lead also
climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
