Imperial Air Cargo, the logistics
joint venture between  Imperial Holdings Ltd. (IPL)  and  Comair Ltd. (COM) ,
asked South Africa’s Competition Commission to investigate the
overnight air freight industry, saying state-funded South
African Airways Ltd. has an unfair advantage on pricing.  “SAA Cargo has frozen its prices since April 2012, despite
the impact of increased costs and deteriorating exchange
rates,” Imperial Logistics Chief Integration Officer Cobus
Rossouw said today in an e-mailed statement. “It is our view
that SAA Cargo’s conduct can only be seen as an exclusionary
strategy to eliminate the only remaining competitor, IAC, from
the domestic overnight express airfreight market.”  While Imperial Air Cargo has increased its freight tariffs
by 10 percent in a year to reflect higher costs, SAA Cargo
pricing is unchanged, Rossouw said today on a conference call.  A spokesman for the Pretoria-based Competition Commission
declined to comment when asked by e-mail about IAC’s request. He
said the Commission will release a statement tomorrow.  A spokesman for SAA didn’t return e-mailed queries and
telephone calls.  Imperial Air Cargo flies three Boeing 737-200s between
Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth, with road
feeder services to East London, George and Bloemfontein, Roussow
said. The aircraft fly overnight, five days a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
