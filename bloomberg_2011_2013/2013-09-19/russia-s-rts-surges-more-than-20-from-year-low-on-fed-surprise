Russian stocks jumped, with the RTS
Index rising more than 20 percent from its low this year, after
the Federal Reserve refrained from reducing monetary stimulus,
easing concern inflows to emerging markets will be cut.  The dollar-denominated RTS added 4.1 percent to 1,487.97 by
11:37 a.m. in Moscow, the third-biggest rally among 94 global
indexes tracked by Bloomberg and a 21 percent increase from a
2013 low in June. The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  climbed 1.8 percent to
1,491.91, set for the strongest close since March 15. OAO
Sberbank, the nation’s largest lender, rose 3 percent to 102.64
rubles, the highest level on an intraday basis since May 29.  The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee said yesterday after
a two-day meeting that it wants to see more more evidence that
economic progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of
its $85 billion in monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage
debt. The Micex advanced an average 77 percent during the Fed’s
first two rounds of bond buying, and fell 0.6 percent in periods
of no stimulus, the biggest difference among 46 emerging and
developed markets tracked by Bloomberg.  “The Fed’s decision came as a big surprise,” Vadim Bit-Avragim, who helps manage about $4.4 billion at Kapital Asset
Management in Moscow, said by phone. “ Emerging markets  could’ve
suffered significantly from a cut to liquidity.”  Downside Risks  While downside risks to the outlook have diminished,
“tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months,
if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement,” the central
bank said in  Washington . Economists had forecast the FOMC would
dial down monthly Treasury purchases by $5 billion, to $40
billion, while maintaining its buying of mortgage-backed
securities at $40 billion, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “This is a very positive signal for Russian bank shares,”
Kapital’s Bit-Avragim said. “Banks are the main beneficiaries
of this decision now that we’re seeing the ruble rally.”  The ruble increased 0.7 percent to 31.6025 against the
dollar in the 10th day of gains, poised for the longest winning
streak on record. VTB Group, the nation’s second-biggest lender,
added 1.2 percent to 4.431 kopeks in Moscow and 3.3 percent to
$2.8 in  London . Sberbank, which accounted for about 45 percent
of retail deposits in  Russia  as of April 1, soared 5.9 percent
to $13.01 in London.  Overbought Stocks  The Micex’s 14-day Relative Strength Index rose to 73.17
today, above the level of 70, which suggests to some analysts
that a security has been overbought and is poised for a decline.
It closed at 67.36 yesterday. The RSI measures how rapidly
prices have advanced or dropped during a specified time period.  Crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, added 0.5 percent
to $108.63 in New York, gaining for the second day. The country
receives about 50 percent of budget revenue from oil and natural
gas sales. Standard & Poor’s  GSCI Commodities Index (SPGSCI)  advanced 0.8
percent.  Most metals rose in London. OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest
coking coal producer, jumped 3.7 percent to 115 rubles. OAO
Gazprom, the nation’s biggest natural gas producer, surged 3.3
percent to 149.05 rubles in the nation’s capital and rallied 5.3
percent to $9.42 in London.  The Micex sank 0.7 percent on Sept. 13 as Russia’s central
bank kept the  refinancing rate  unchanged at 8.25 percent,
matching the forecast of 14 out of 22 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Russia’s economy expanded 1.2 percent in the second
quarter, the Federal Statistics Service reported on Aug. 9,
missing the median estimate for 2 percent.  Russian equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21
emerging economies tracked by Bloomberg, with shares trading at
4.3 times 12-month estimated earnings, compared with a multiple
of 10.8 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Trading volume on
the Micex surged today, with the average volume at about 247
percent above the 30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Ten-day price swings jumped to 18.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian stocks in New York gained 2.9 percent yesterday, while

exchange-traded fund, advanced 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
