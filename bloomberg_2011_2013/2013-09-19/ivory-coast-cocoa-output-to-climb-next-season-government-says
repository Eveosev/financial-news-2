Cocoa output in Ivory Coast, the
world’s biggest producer, will rise in the season starting in
October after farmers planted “high-quality seeds” in the past
few years, Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan said.  The crop will also increase because of distribution this
year of fertilizers and pesticides, Duncan told reporters today
in Abidjan. He gave no estimate for production.  The national industry regulator, Le Conseil du Cafe-Cacao,
is working to enable the season to start early next month as
scheduled, Duncan said. Ivory Coast harvests its main cocoa crop
from October through March and the smaller mid-crop from April
through September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
