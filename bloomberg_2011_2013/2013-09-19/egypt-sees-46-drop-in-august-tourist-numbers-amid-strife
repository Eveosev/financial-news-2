The number of tourists arriving in
 Egypt  tumbled by almost 46 percent in August compared with the
same month last year, the Tourism Ministry said in e-mailed
statement today.  A total of 564,517 tourists visited Egypt in August this
year compared with 1,037,785 in the same month last year,
according to the figures. On July 3, Egypt’s military ousted the
country’s Islamist President Mohamed Mursi, following mass
protests, after which some tourism companies suspended flights.  Tourism is one of the government’s main sources of foreign
currency and its decline has added to pressure on currency
reserves. Egypt ranked last in terms of security and safety on
the  World Economic Forum ’s 2013 Travel and Tourism
Competitiveness Index.  A ballooning accident in February, in which at least 19
foreign tourists died, added to difficulties in reviving
tourism.  Meanwhile, a senior Egyptian police officer was shot dead
by gunmen as security forces stormed an Islamist stronghold near
Cairo today in the latest outbreak of violence.  Egypt has seen mounting political and security tension
since the army’s ouster of Mursi and the violent dispersal of
two pro-democracy sit-ins on August 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
