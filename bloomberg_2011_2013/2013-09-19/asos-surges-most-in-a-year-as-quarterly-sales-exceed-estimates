Asos Plc (ASC) , the U.K.’s largest
Internet-only clothing retailer, said it may reach 1 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion) in annual sales earlier than its 2015 goal
amid booming demand for online fashions.  “It looks like that could be coming a year earlier,” co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Nick Robertson said by phone
today after the company reported accelerating revenue growth and
said earnings for the year just ended beat analyst estimates.  Asos set the five-year sales target in 2010, when it had
annual revenue of 223 million pounds. Analysts expect the
London-based company to post sales of 987 million pounds in the
12 months ending August 2014, rising to 1.2 billion pounds the
year after, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The online retailer is benefiting from buoyant demand both
at home and abroad and today reported 47 percent growth in
fourth-quarter retail sales to 207.9 million pounds as the
number of active customers rose 42 percent from a year earlier
to 7.1 million. The median  estimate  of 13 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg was for a 43 percent increase in sales.  “Asos is set for a number of years of rapid growth as a
world leading online retailer,” Richard Edwards, an analyst at
Citigroup Inc., said in a note today.  Asos rose as much as 522 pence, or 11 percent, to 5,355
pence in London trading and was up 9.5 percent at 5,293 pence as
of 10:35 a.m. The gain almost erased a decline in the stock over
the previous two days after Morgan Stanley lowered its
 recommendation  on Asos to underweight.  The shares have almost doubled in 2013 after rising more
than 10-fold in the previous four years.  Lower Prices  The company had a “cracking” U.K. performance in the
fourth quarter after lowering prices last year and increasing
spending on digital marketing, Robertson said.  Pretax profit for the year ended Aug. 31 will be
“marginally” above estimates, according to Asos, which is due
to report the earnings Oct. 23. Analysts expect full-year pretax
profit of 52.8 million pounds, based on the average of 17
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company made 44.5 million
before tax and one-time items in the previous 12 months.  International sales accounted for 64 percent of group
revenue in the quarter, down from 65 percent a year earlier as
the online retailer’s U.K. retail sales rose 49 percent. In
 Australia , the company has seen a slowdown in the past three
months as the  exchange rate  has made its products there about 20
percent more expensive, Robertson said.  Asos, which sells more than 60,000 branded and own-label
products to 241 countries and territories, added a local
language website in  Russia  in May and plans to start a Chinese
version later this year.  “The lion’s share of our sales is still going to come from
more developed markets in the short to medium-term,” Robertson
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
