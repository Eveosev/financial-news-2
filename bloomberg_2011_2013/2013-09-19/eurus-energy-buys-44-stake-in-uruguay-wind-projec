Eurus Energy Holdings Corp., a
renewable-energy company jointly owned by Tokyo Electric Power
Co. and  Toyota Tsusho Corp. (8015) , bought 44 percent of a wind farm
being built in southeastern Uruguay by Akuo Energy SAS.  The 42-megawatt Minas wind farm will include 14 turbines
from Denmark’s  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  and sell energy to state
power utility Administracion Nacional de Usinas & Trasmisiones
Electricas under a 20-year contract, the companies said in a
joint statement today. The purchase price wasn’t disclosed.  Construction on the project, located in Lavalleja, began in
March and is expected to be done in early 2014.  “Eurus Energy America is pleased to partner with Akuo on
the Minas project and to expand our renewable footprint into
 South America ,” Mark Anderson, chief executive officer of Eurus
Energy, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
