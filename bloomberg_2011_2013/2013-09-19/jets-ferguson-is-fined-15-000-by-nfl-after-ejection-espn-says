New York  Jets left tackle
D’Brickashaw Ferguson was fined $15,000 by the National Football
League for his role in a scuffle at the end of last week’s loss
to the New England Patriots,  ESPN New York said .  Jets center Nick Mangold and guard Willie Colon might also
face fines for their involvement in the Sept. 12 incident, which
occurred after Mangold’s late hit on Aqib Talib as the Patriots’
cornerback was returning an interception in the final minute.
The NFL doesn’t confirm fines until Fridays.  Ferguson was ejected from the game after appearing to throw
a punch as players from both teams came together near the
sideline and were pushing and shoving each other. Colon was also
ejected after making contact with an official, while Mangold was
penalized for a late hit after diving and hitting Talib below
the knees after he stepped out of bounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
