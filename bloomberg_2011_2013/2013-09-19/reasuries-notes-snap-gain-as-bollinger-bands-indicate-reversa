Treasury 10-year notes snapped a
six-day rally, capped by yesterdayâ€™s biggest advance in almost
two years, as a technical indicator showed the gain is due to
reverse.  Ten-year yields fell as far as 2.67 percent yesterday,
sliding below a lower  Bollinger band level  that suggests the
drop in rates is about to end. Analysts use the bands to
determine a probable range for a rate or security.  U.S. government securities surged yesterday after the
 Federal Reserve  decided to maintain its pace of Treasury and
mortgage purchases at $85 billion a month.  Benchmark 10-year  yields  rose one basis point from late
yesterday in  New York  to 2.70 percent as of 9:11 a.m. in  Tokyo ,
based on Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.5
percent note due in August 2023 fell 2/32, or 63 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 98 9/32.  Thirty-year yields increased three basis points to 3.77
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
