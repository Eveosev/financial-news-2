Canadian Industry Minister  James
Moore  said he wants  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  to emerge from its struggles
as a healthy competitor to larger mobile platforms led by Google
Inc.’s Android and Apple Inc.’s iOS.  “I want BlackBerry to grow and to continue to employ
Canadians and to continue to innovate and be a challenger to the
Android and iOS platforms and Windows platforms,” Moore told
reporters in Oakville, Ontario today. Moore said he’s hopeful
BlackBerry can “make it on its own.”  While the Waterloo, Ontario-based company tries to revive
sales and profitability with a new lineup of phones, it said
last month it will weigh potential takeover offers.  BlackBerry climbed after Moore’s remarks, and were trading
2.2 percent higher at $10.63 at 12:45 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
