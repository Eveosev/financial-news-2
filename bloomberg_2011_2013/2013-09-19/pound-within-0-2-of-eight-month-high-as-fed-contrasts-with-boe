The pound dropped by the most in
seven weeks against the dollar after a government report showed
U.K.  retail sales  unexpectedly declined in August.  Britain’s currency weakened versus 11 of its 16 major
counterparts as the data damped optimism the economy is gaining
momentum. U.K. government bonds rallied, with 10-year yields
falling the most in three weeks, after Federal Reserve policy
makers yesterday unexpectedly refrained from slowing debt
purchases. The Debt Management Office sold 4.75 billion pounds
($7.63 billion) of five-year gilts.  “Retail sales has proved a bit of a reality check for
sterling,” said Simon Smith, chief economist at FxPro Group
Ltd. in London. “There had a decent run of better-than-expected
data in the U.K. which had been pushing the pound higher and the
Fed just gave it last push above $1.60. It had the wind taken
out of its sails a bit.”  The pound weakened 0.6 percent to $1.6049 at 4:40 p.m.
 London  time, the biggest decline since July 30. It jumped as
much as 1.6 percent to $1.6163 yesterday. Sterling depreciated
0.7 percent to 84.29 pence per euro.  Retail sales including fuel fell 0.9 percent from July, the
Office for National Statistics said. The median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 0.4
percent. Reports earlier this month showed manufacturing surged,
the jobless rate dropped and house prices increased.  Best Performer  The pound has risen 5.6 percent in the past six months, the
best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 4.2
percent, while the dollar fell 1.3 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield dropped 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 2.91 percent, the biggest decline since
Aug. 27. The 2.25 percent bond due September 2023 rose 0.81, or
8.10 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.365.  U.S. policy makers said they want more evidence of a
recovery before paring their $85 billion-a-month quantitative-easing program. Chairman Ben. S. Bernanke said the central bank
must determine its policies based on “what’s needed for the
economy,” even if it surprises markets.  U.K. 10-year yields climbed to 3.05 percent on Sept. 11,
the highest level since July 2011. They have risen more than one
percentage point this year.  Gilt Sale  The Debt Management Office auctioned five-year gilts at an
average yield of 1.652 percent, compared with a rate of 1.405
percent at a previous sale on Aug. 6.  U.K. government bonds lost 4.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
bunds fell 2.7 percent and Treasuries dropped 2.9 percent.  Bank of England minutes published yesterday showed the
nine-member Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to keep
its  bond-purchase stimulus program  at 375 billion pounds and the
 benchmark interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent.  “The general consensus is that clearly this is a more
dovish Fed than they thought and clearly it throws some doubt
around the timing of the removal of their QE policies,” said
Greg Gibbs, a senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in  Singapore . “The Bank of England had a
more hawkish bent in its minutes yesterday so we’ve seen
significant improvement in the pound,” he said, referring to
the currency’s gain yesterday.  Sterling will probably see some resistance around current
levels though may still strengthen to around $1.63, Gibbs said.
Resistance refers to an area where sell orders may be clustered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
