John Coughlin, the brother of New
York Giants coach  Tom Coughlin , died three days ago at the age
of 63, the team said.  John Coughlin was taken off life support at Hackensack
Medical Center on Sept. 16, a day after he struck his head on
the ground when he tripped while getting out of a cab, according
to the Star-Ledger of Newark,  New Jersey .  “John was a friend to all,” Tom Coughlin, 67, said in a
statement. “He loved life, and he will be greatly missed. He
left us way too soon.”  The younger Coughlin was on the sidelines when the Giants
lost the second game of the season, 41-23 to the  Denver Broncos 
on Sept. 15. He was a horse trainer who operated Coughlin’s
Stables in East Rutherford, next to the Giants’ Metlife Stadium.  Besides his brother, John Coughlin is survived by five
sisters. Funeral services are Sept. 24 at St. Mary’s Church in
Waterloo, New York.  Tom Coughlin told his players he would travel with them on
Sept. 22 to the  Carolina Panthers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
