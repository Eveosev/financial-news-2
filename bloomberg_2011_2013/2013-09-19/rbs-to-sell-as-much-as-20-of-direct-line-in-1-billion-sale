Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
raised about 630 million pounds ($1 billion) from its third sale
of a stake in  Direct Line Insurance Group Plc (DLG) , the U.K.’s
biggest home and car insurer.  RBS (RBS)  sold about 300 million shares at 210 pence apiece to
institutional investors, or 20 percent of Direct Line, the
Edinburgh-based lender said in a statement today. Direct Line
fell 2.2 percent to 213.2 pence by 8:17 a.m. in  London . RBS now
owns about  28.5 percent  of the insurer.  RBS, Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, has to
divest the insurer to comply with European Union rules after
receiving a 45.5 billion-pound bailout in 2008 and 2009. Direct
Line, which sold shares to the public in October, is cutting
costs and seeking to sell more profitable policies amid falling
premiums in the U.K. and lower returns on investments amid
record-low interest rates.  “This successful sale keeps RBS fully on track to meet its
obligation to divest its stake in Direct Line by end-2014,” RBS
Finance Director Bruce Van Saun said in the statement.  The calculation of the proceeds assumes an over allotment
option to sell 27.3 million shares is exercised in full.  Issuers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa have raised
about $74 billion in additional share sales this year, compared
with about $37 billion in the same period in 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.K. government sold 4.28 billion shares for 3.2
billion pounds in  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  this week in the
largest accelerated sale of secondary shares since 2009.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of
 Canada  and UBS AG are managing the Direct Line sale, which
started after the end of trading in London yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
