United Wind Inc. , a developer of
small-scale wind energy systems for homes and businesses,
arranged as much as $25 million in funding from GSG Energy
Finance for turbines it plans to lease to users in rural areas.  The tax equity financing will let farms, wineries and bed
and breakfasts install about 150  wind turbines  by the end of
next year with little to no upfront costs, United Wind Chief
Executive Officer Russell Tencer said today in a phone
interview.  Most of the wind turbines will be installed in rural parts
of New York, Oregon, Massachusetts and Maryland, where power is
relatively expensive and permitting easy, Tencer said.  United Wind is based in  San Diego  and GSG Energy Finance is
based in Brooklyn, New York.  U.S. consumers and businesses installed 175 megawatts of
wind turbines last year to generate their own electricity and
reduce their dependence on utilities, according to the U.S.
Energy Department. Most of the turbines installed at customer
sites were 100 kilowatts or less.  To contact the reporter on this story:
