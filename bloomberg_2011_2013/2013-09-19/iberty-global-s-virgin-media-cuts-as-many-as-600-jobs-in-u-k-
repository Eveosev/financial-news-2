Virgin Media , the U.K. pay-TV
operator bought by Liberty Global Plc this year, is cutting as
many as 600 mid-to-senior-level jobs to eliminate duplicate
roles across the parent company’s European business.  Employees were informed of the cuts today, at the start of
a 90-day consultation to trim costs, Gareth Mead, a Virgin Media
spokesman, said by phone. While engineers and call-center staff
won’t be affected, the job eliminations could account for 4
percent of Virgin Media’s U.K. workforce of 15,000, he said.  “Like organizations across the public and private sector,
Virgin Media is making sure it has the structure it needs to
meet the needs of its customers,” Virgin Media Chief Executive
Officer Tom Mockridge said in an e-mailed statement. “These
proposals are designed to take advantage of the opportunities
that come with being part of the world’s largest cable operator
and create an organization that’s fit for growth.“  Liberty Global, controlled by U.S. billionaire John Malone,
paid $16 billion for Virgin Media to expand in Europe’s biggest
cable-TV market. Virgin Media competes against  British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) , the U.K.’s biggest pay-TV company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
