The  Indianapolis Colts  acquired
running back Trent Richardson from the winless  Cleveland Browns 
in exchange for a first-round pick in the 2014 National Football
League draft.  The Colts’ offense has lost running back Vick Ballard,
tight end Dwayne Allen and guard Donald Thomas to season-ending
injuries in the past seven days, with all three facing surgery.  “We need running backs,” Colts General Manager Ryan Grigson said. “We need people who can get us yards, can keep
defenses honest. We’re going to run the football. Trent has
proven he can run it. It’s nice to add him because he makes us
better, period.”  Richardson, 23, led  Cleveland  with 950 yards rushing and 11
touchdowns on 267 attempts last season, with three 100-yard
rushing games. This season, he has 31 carries for 105 yards.  After starting all 17 games since the Browns selected him
third overall in the 2012 draft, he has 298 carries for 1,055
yards and 11 touchdowns as well as 58 receptions for 418 yards
and one touchdown during his career.  Browns Chief Executive Officer Joe Banner acknowledged that
the Colts, who had the 24th pick in last year’s draft after
going 11-5, probably won’t repeat their 2011 season -- when they
went 2-14 to earn the No. 1 overall pick and took quarterback
 Andrew Luck  in the 2012 draft.  Good Value  “They’re 1-1 and there’s 14 games to go,” Banner said
last night in a news conference. “It’s reasonable to expect
that they’re a good team but we’ll see how the year goes.”  In 1983, the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  gave up a first-round
draft pick to the  Cincinnati Bengals  to acquire quarterback Jack
Thompson. When the Buccaneers went a league-worst 2-14, the
Bengals got the No. 1 pick in the 1984 draft.  Banner said the Browns (0-2) profited by trading Richardson.  “As we looked forward to what we need to get accomplished,
we felt this was good value and gave us an opportunity to
accomplish what we want to do as we go forward,” Banner told
reporters.  Trade talks between the Colts and Browns started two days
ago, Banner said.  “This was more about the moment that presented itself
based on the situation the Colts found themselves in,” Banner
said. “It wasn’t something where we could say, ‘Can you wait
three weeks and let us think about this or learn more?”’  Richardson’s addition to the Colts’ roster had little
impact on Indianapolis’ odds of winning the  Super Bowl , said R.J.
Bell, founder of Pregame.com in  Las Vegas .  Little Difference  “Sportsbooks with a larger client base of casual bettors
have improved Indy’s odds from around 75-1 to 50-1 to win the
Super Bowl,” Bell said in an e-mail. “Sportsbooks with a
larger client base of sophisticated bettors have not improved
Indy’s odds. These sharper bettors acknowledge that Richardson
is a big name, but do not expect him to make much of a
difference.”  Richardson, in three seasons at the  University of Alabama ,
helped the Crimson Tide capture national championships in 2009
and 2011. He had 3,130 career yards rushing and 35 touchdowns on
540 attempts while adding 69 receptions for 730 yards and seven
touchdowns. He also returned 28 kickoffs for 720 yards with one
touchdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
