Prudential Financial Inc., the No.
2 U.S. life insurer, lost a bid to overturn a risk designation
from federal regulators that carries increased oversight.  “The company is entitled to bring an action in  U.S.
federal court  for an order requiring that the final
determination be rescinded,” Newark, New Jersey-based
Prudential said today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
