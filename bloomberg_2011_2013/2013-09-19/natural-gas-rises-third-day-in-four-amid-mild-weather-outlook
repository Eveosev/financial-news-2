Natural gas was higher in New York
after falling yesterday on speculation that milder weather in
the U.S. will cut demand for the power-station fuel.  Futures for October delivery were at $3.721 per million
British thermal units in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up 0.2 percent, at 11:16 a.m. Singapore
time. The contract fell 0.9 percent yesterday, the biggest drop
since Sept. 6.  Forecasts showed seasonally mild weather on the East Coast
of the U.S. and cooler readings in the West from Sept. 23
through Sept. 27, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda, Maryland. The high temperature in  New York City  on
Sept. 24 may be 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 Celsius) and
Washington may be 76 degrees, both in line with historical
norms, said AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  U.S.  gas inventories  probably rose by 55 billion cubic feet
in the week ended Sept. 13, according to the median estimate of
21 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before a report today
from the Energy Information Administration.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
