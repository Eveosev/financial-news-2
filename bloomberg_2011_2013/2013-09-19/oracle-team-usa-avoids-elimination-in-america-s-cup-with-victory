Oracle Team USA held off
elimination in the America’s Cup by defeating Emirates Team New
Zealand in today’s first race on San Francisco Bay.  The victory still left the defending champions behind 8-2
in the best-of-17 series, with another race scheduled for later
this afternoon.  The Kiwis need one more win to clinch the latest version of
the 162-year-old sailing competition. The USA team, backrolled
by Oracle Corp. chief executive  Larry Ellison , has to win the
next seven races to retain the Auld Mug.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
