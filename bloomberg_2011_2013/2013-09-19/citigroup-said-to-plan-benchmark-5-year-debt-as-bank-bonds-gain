Citigroup Inc. (C)  issued $1.75 billion
in five-year notes in the U.S. as the extra yield investors
demand to own financial-company bonds declined.  The third-biggest U.S. bank by assets sold the 2.5 percent
senior unsecured securities to yield 112 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The bonds are expected to be rated Baa2 by Moody’s
Investors Service, the second-lowest level of investment grade,
according to a person familiar with the offering, who asked not
to be identified, citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly. The New-York based lender managed the deal.  Companies in the U.S. sold or plan to sell $14.9 billion of
debt today, bringing offerings for the week to $32.2 billion,
Bloomberg data show. Sales are down from last week’s $90.6
billion, the busiest week ever for dollar offerings, after
Verizon Communication Inc.’s record $49 billion deal. The
offerings compare with a weekly average of $29.7 billion.  Today’s sales followed the biggest one-day drop in yields
in more than two months, sparked by the  Federal Reserve ’s
unexpected decision yesterday to maintain its $85 billion pace
of monthly bond buying. Yields on debt from the most
creditworthy to the riskiest U.S. companies declined to 4.12
percent yesterday from 4.21 percent on Sept. 17, the biggest
decrease since a 10 basis-point drop on July 11, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show.  Relative yields on senior bonds of financial companies fell
6.4 basis points today to 107.8 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. are the two
largest U.S. banks by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
