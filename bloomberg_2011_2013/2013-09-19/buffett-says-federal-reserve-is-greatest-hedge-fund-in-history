Billionaire investor  Warren Buffett 
compared the U.S. Federal Reserve to a hedge fund because of the
central bank’s ability to profit from bond purchases as it
accumulated a balance sheet of more than $3 trillion.  “The Fed is the greatest hedge fund in history,” Buffett
told students today at Georgetown University in Washington.  To contact the reporters on this story:
