Two factions of Nigeria’s ruling
People’s  Democratic Party  are locked in a court battle over who
has the right to represent the political force that has governed
 Africa ’s top oil producer for the past 14 years.  A  High Court  in the commercial capital, Lagos, is hearing
the case brought by party dissidents to demand that PDP Chairman
Bamanga Tukur and other party leaders be ordered to stop
“parading or holding themselves out as officers” of the PDP,
according to court documents. The case was adjourned yesterday
until Sept. 25, Robert Emukpoeruo, a lawyer representating the
defectors, said in an e-mailed statement.  Dozens of lawmakers have lent support to the dissidents,
sparking televised arguments and fights in both houses of
parliament on Sept. 17. The party rebels, led by former Vice
President Abubakar Atiku, walked out of an Aug. 31 PDP
convention to form the New PDP.  The split comes as political maneuvering begins before
general elections in 2015. The defectors are demanding that
President  Goodluck Jonathan , a southern Christian, announce that
he won’t run in the 2015 vote, respecting an unwritten rule in
the party to rotate the presidency between the mainly Muslim
north and predominantly Christian south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
