A 12-bottle consignment of 2006
Chateau d’Yquem, Bordeaux’s top-ranked Sauternes dessert wine,
sold for a record low 2,100 pounds ($3,350) on the Liv-ex market
this week as demand remained muted for the region’s top growers.  The wine sold for 14 percent less than the 2,430 pounds at
which it traded in January and 34 percent down from its November
2011 peak of 3,200 pounds, according to data on London-based
Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  While much of the vintage’s decline mirrored a broader drop
in the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index during the first half of last
year, it has continued to retreat even as the index has regained
3.5 percent this year. Investor attention has been switching to
wines from other regions, and Sauternes dessert wines typically
command lower prices than comparable Bordeaux reds.  The Sauternes 50 Liv-ex sub-index for Bordeaux dessert
wines is a “perennial underperformer,” which declined further
last month, according to a recent Liv-ex market blog commentary.  Yquem 2006 has sold at lower prices at auction this year,
with two cases fetching 1,755 pounds each at a  Christie’s
International Plc  sale in  London  in June, according to results
on its website.  Yquem’s 2006 vintage is only its sixth-most expensive of
the 10 most recent traded years, and sells for less than half
the price of the 2009 and 2010 wines, according to merchant
prices tracked by Liv-ex.  The 2006 Yquem was awarded a range of 96-98+ points out of
100 by U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker  in an online tasting note
in February 2009, according to the  eRobertParker  website.  Chateau d’Yquem is owned by Paris-based  LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the world’s largest luxury goods maker, which
is led by billionaire  Bernard Arnault . The wine estate is
managed by Pierre Lurton, who also has responsibility for
Chateau Cheval Blanc in Saint-Emilion.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Guy Collins in London at
