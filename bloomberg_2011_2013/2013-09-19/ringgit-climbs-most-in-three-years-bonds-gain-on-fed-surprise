Malaysia ’s ringgit rallied the most
in three years and 10-year bond yields sank to a two-month low
after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly refrained from cutting
stimulus that’s spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency led gains in Asia, climbing 2.1 percent to
3.1662 per dollar as of 10:25 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, the biggest
advance since May 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It
reached 3.1584, the strongest since July 11. One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 2.2 percent to 3.1671.  The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee said it wants to
see more evidence of a recovery in the world’s largest economy
before starting to taper $85 billion a month of bond purchases,
spurring a 1 percent gain in the FTSE Bursa Malaysia  KLCI Index (FBMKLCI) 
of shares. The U.S. is Malaysia’s fourth-largest overseas market,
with  shipments  rising in July after a five-month contraction.  “Asian currencies are reacting to the Fed’s non-tapering,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange
research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in  Singapore . “The ringgit is
stronger than most of the currencies in the region because it’s
more elastic to shocks.”  One-month implied volatility in the ringgit, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped 31 basis points, or 0.31 percentage point, to 10.44
percent, the biggest decline this month.  Ten-year government bonds advanced for a 10th day, the
longest winning streak since the 3.48 percent notes were sold in
March. The yield fell three basis points to 3.73 percent, the
lowest since July 15, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The cost to protect the nation’s sovereign debt from
default for five years plunged nine percentage points yesterday
to 111.5, the least in two months, CMA default swaps prices show.  Official data showed yesterday that  consumer prices  climbed
1.9 percent in August from a year earlier, less than the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a 2 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
