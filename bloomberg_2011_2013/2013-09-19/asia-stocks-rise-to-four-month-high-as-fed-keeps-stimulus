benchmark regional index gaining the most in a year, after the
Federal Reserve unexpectedly refrained from cutting U.S.
economic stimulus.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 2.2 percent to 141.73

begin later this year should the data confirm the Fed’s “basic
outlook,” Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said.  “It’s taper off, risk on,” Keith Poore, head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Wellington,
which manages about $130 billion, said by telephone.
“Ultimately it will be supportive for markets. You want to hold
on to your risk positions if you have them at the moment. We
take it as a positive, as it’s definitely dovish.”  Japan’s  Topix (TPX)  index rose 1.9 percent to its highest close

unprecedented monetary easing. About 13 trillion yen ($131
billion) was added to the market capitalization of the Topix
last week after the city’s winning bid for the 2020 Olympic
Games was announced, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  North Asian stocks will rise faster this year than the rest
of the region as a strengthening global economy boosts exports,
according to Haren Shah, Singapore-based chief strategist for

which oversees $210 billion. The firm is recommending investors
buy technology and industrial companies from China, South Korea
