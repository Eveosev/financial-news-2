The government’s auction of $13
billion of 10-year inflation-indexed notes may draw yield of
0.488 percent, according to the average forecast of six of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which mature
in July 2023, yielded 0.475 percent in trading before the
auction. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York time.  The securities yielded 0.384 percent on July 18 at the last
sale, the first positive yielding auction since November 2011.
The securities yielded a record low of negative 0.75 percent in
September 2012.  The July sale’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.44,
versus an average of 2.66 at the previous 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders , a category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 57.7 percent of the securities at
the July sale, compared to an average of 48.3 percent at the
past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 6.9 percent of
the securities at the July sale, versus a 12 percent average at
the past 10 auctions.  Inflation-indexed notes pay interest at lower rates than
nominal Treasuries on a principal amount that’s linked to the
Labor Department’s consumer price index.  TIPS have lost 7.9 percent this year after returning 7.3
percent in 2012, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
U.S. Inflation-Linked Treasury Index. The broader Treasury
market has fallen 2.9 percent this year, compared with a 2.2
percent gain in 2012, the indexes show.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade Treasuries with the central
bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
