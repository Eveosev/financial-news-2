Bill Gross , manager of the world’s
biggest bond mutual fund, said the U.S. Federal Reserve will
emphasize meeting inflation targets if  Janet Yellen  becomes
chairman.  “The Federal Reserve, certainly, if Yellen is appointed as
the chairperson will become increasingly focused on inflation,”
Gross, co-founder of Newport Beach, California-based Pacific
Investment Management Co., said today during a Bloomberg
Television interview with Trish Regan and Adam Johnson. The
focus on getting the inflation rate higher would support low
yields for shorter-term Treasuries, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
