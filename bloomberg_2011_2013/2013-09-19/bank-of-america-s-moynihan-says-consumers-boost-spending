Bank of America Corp.  Chief
Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said consumers are spending
5 percent to 6 percent more in September than a year earlier
amid slow, constructive growth in the economy.  While there’s a lot of work to be done to reach a 3 percent
economic growth rate, Moynihan doesn’t see a lot of downside
risk, he said today during an interview on CNBC. Moynihan, 53,
made the remarks during a joint appearance with billionaire
 Warren Buffett , chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., who said
the economy is creeping along.  Bank of America is the second-largest U.S. bank by assets.
Under Buffett, 83, Berkshire invested $5 billion in Moynihan’s
company in 2011 after the lender’s stock fell more than 45
percent amid mounting losses from home mortgages.  Berkshire owns an  array  of financial, industrial and
consumer companies with brands ranging from Geico insurance to
Dairy Queen ice cream. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company also
owns stakes in Wells Fargo & Co., U.S. Bancorp and M&T Bank
Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
