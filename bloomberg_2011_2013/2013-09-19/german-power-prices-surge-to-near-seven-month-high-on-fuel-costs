German power for delivery next
month jumped to the  highest since January  as rising fuel prices
boosted costs for generators.  The contract yesterday gained 14 percent since Aug. 26 as
the equivalent  coal contract  rose 6.7 percent in the period and
European emissions permits climbed 25 percent, according to
broker and exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.  Germany  boosted its share of power supply from renewable
energy sources such as wind and solar to 23 percent last year
from 17 percent in 2010, increasing its reliance on less
predictable forms of generation. Renewable energy gets priority
access to Germany’s grid and solar output is highest in summer
months, when sunshine hours are greater and electricity demand
for heating is lower.  “If there is a lack of wind in October then prices could
really rise, especially if it is cold,” Daniel Juul Jensen, a
senior trader at Danske Commodities A/S, said yesterday by phone
from Aarhus,  Denmark . “People are a bit afraid of no wind and
no solar next month.”  German  next-month power  rose 1 percent to 42.10 euros ($57)
a megawatt-hour yesterday, the highest closing price since Jan.
29, and was at 41.60 euros at 9:35 a.m. Berlin time today,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Month-ahead coal 
increased 2 percent yesterday to $81.60 a metric ton, the
highest close since May 16, while carbon fell 2.6 percent to
5.53 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London.  Clean Darks  The clean-dark spread, a measure of the profitability of
coal-fired plants next month that takes into account power
prices and fuel costs, widened 30 percent since Aug. 26 to close
at 12.77 euros a megawatt-hour yesterday, the highest since Jan.
30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Available generating capacity is forecast to rise to 63,345
megawatts on Oct. 18 compared with 55,571 megawatts today,
according to  data  from European Energy Exchange AG. Nuclear,
coal and gas-fed power plants typically undergo maintenance in
the spring and summer, when warmer weather cuts power
consumption.  “Plant availability should be better but we know for sure
that solar won’t have that much impact compared to this month or
August,” Juul Jensen said. “If there are only a few nuclear or
lignite outages, then the price could rise even higher.”  Solar power  in Germany reached a record 24,019 megawatts on
July 21, according to EEX data. That compares with a peak of
13,770 megawatts forecast today, according to Bloomberg’s solar
model.  Wind output  climbed to a record 23,331 megawatts on Jan.
31, the EEX data show.  The average temperature in Germany next week will be 11.4
degrees Celsius, according to the GFS model supplied by
MetraWeather at 6:39 a.m. That compares with a seasonal norm of
13 degrees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
