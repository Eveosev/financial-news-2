Sugar, cocoa and coffee advanced in
New York trading after the  Federal Reserve  said it will keep
bond purchases to stimulate economic growth in the U.S., sending
raw materials into a rally.  Policy makers want to see more evidence that improvement in
the  U.S. economy  will be sustained before adjusting the Fed’s
$85 billion in monthly debt purchases, the central bank said
yesterday. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted a $5
billion reduction of quantitative easing, as the stimulus is
known. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of 24 raw materials
advanced 0.9 percent after rallying 1.5 percent yesterday.  “The Fed’s action took most by surprise,” Jonathan Bouchet, a trader at Boman Capital SA in Geneva, said by e-mail
today. “Consumption of raw materials could slowly increase
seeing central banks all over the world acting as such. You
could definitely see a rebound in the whole commodity space.”  Cocoa for December delivery gained 0.3 percent to $2,630 a
metric ton by 5:48 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . The
price reached $2,657 earlier, the highest since Sept. 14, 2012.  Raw sugar for delivery in March rose 0.9 percent to 17.64
cents a pound, after touching 17.66 cents a pound, the highest
in almost a week, and arabica coffee for December delivery
advanced 1.2 percent to $1.1625 a pound.  While sugar and coffee futures in New York declined 9.6
percent and 19 percent respectively this year as supplies
outpace demand, shortages of cocoa sent prices up 18 percent.
Cocoa supplies will trail demand by 173,000 tons in the 12
months starting Oct. 1, estimates Macquarie Group Ltd.,
 Australia ’s biggest investment bank. The beans used to make
chocolate are the second-best performer in the GSCI gauge, after
crude.  Brazilian Real  The “Fed held off, so the initial reaction was a bounce in
stocks, bonds and commodities,”  Michael McDougall , head of the
Brazil desk at brokerage Newedge Group in New York and who deals
mostly in sugar, said by e-mail yesterday. “How long before the
markets begin to worry why there was no taper?”  The Brazilian real, down 6.2 percent this year, rallied as
much as 3.3 percent yesterday, reducing the incentive for
producers in the world’s biggest sugar and coffee exporter to
sell their commodities priced in U.S. dollars.  “The real picked up hard on the Fed news as well as other
currencies against the dollar,” Boman’s Bouchet said. “That
could also be helping sugar and coffee.”  In London, robusta coffee for delivery in November advanced
1.1 percent to $1,699 a ton on NYSE Liffe, while white sugar for
December delivery rose 0.7 percent to $484.40 a ton. Cocoa for
delivery in the same month fell 0.2 percent to 1,709 pounds
($2,745) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
