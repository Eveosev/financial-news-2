Americas Petrogas Inc. (BOE) , the holder
of more than 2 million acres in Argentine shale formations, is
considering joint ventures, asset divestitures or a sale of the
company.  The board has authorized management to review strategic
alternatives following success in the Vaca Muerta shale and
“recent industry inquiries concerning potential business
opportunities,” the Calgary-based company said in a statement
today. Jefferies Group LLC has been appointed its financial
adviser.  Americas Petrogas operates 14 blocks in the Neuquen basin,
which includes the Vaca Muerta, and announced in April it found
natural gas and liquids in a well it owns there with Exxon Mobil
Corp. Last month,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  said it would spend $1.24
billion to help develop  Argentina ’s shale, which holds the
world’s third-largest technically recoverable gas resource,
according to U.S.  estimates .  Americas Petrogas gained 7.3 percent to C$1.03 at 10:29
a.m. in New York. The shares have dropped 66 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
