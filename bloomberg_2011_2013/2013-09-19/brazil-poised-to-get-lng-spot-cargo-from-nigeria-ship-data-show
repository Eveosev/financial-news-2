Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a spot
cargo from  Nigeria , according to ship-tracking data.  The LNG Bonny, with a capacity of about 133,000 cubic
meters, is en route to Brazil, according to transmissions
captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. The ship information
shows it was scheduled to arrive Sept. 16. It doesn’t indicate
where the vessel will dock in Brazil.  The tanker loaded the supercooled natural gas at Nigeria
LNG Ltd.’s Bonny Island terminal and departed Sept. 8, the data
show.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Petrobras, as the
Brazilian state-owned company is known, has two floating
regasification terminals located at Guanabara Bay and Pecem.  Petrobras will import as many as 60 cargoes this year, up
from 56 in 2012, the company said June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
