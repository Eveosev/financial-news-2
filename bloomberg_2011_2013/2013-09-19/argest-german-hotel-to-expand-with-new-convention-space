The  Estrel Berlin ,  Germany ’s
largest hotel, is about to get bigger. The owner of the 19-year-old building plans to expand its conference hall to accommodate
4,200 more visitors.  The hotel in Berlin’s Neukoelln district will add 7,700
square meters (83,000 square feet) to its existing 15,000
square-meter convention space, Estrel Hotel-Betriebs-GmbH said
in a statement yesterday. The construction work, which is due to
be completed in 2015, will cost the company about 20 million
euros ($27 million).  Berlin hotel construction is booming as developers take
advantage of increasing tourism. Berlin had 126,000 hotel beds
last year, 18 percent more than in 2009, according to data
compiled by the German Hotel Association. The number of  visitors
to Berlin  rose by 30 percent to 10.8 million in that period,
according to Berlin’s tourism and conventions office.  The Estrel has 1,125 rooms, more than any other German
hotel, spokeswoman Miranda Meier said by phone. The Park Inn
Alexanderplatz, also in Berlin, is the country’s second-largest
hotel with 1,012 rooms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
