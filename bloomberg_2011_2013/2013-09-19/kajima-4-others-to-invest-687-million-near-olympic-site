Kajima Corp. (1812) ,  Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801) ,
Mitsubishi Estate Co., and two other Japanese companies will
spend about 67.5 billion yen ($687 million) to develop a site
near the 2020  Olympic Games  venues.  The estimated investment includes costs to build a 53-story
apartment tower and two other buildings in Kachidoki, according
to Yasuhiko Haga, a spokesman at Kajima. The 1,420-unit
apartment building located less than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles)
away form Ginza’s shopping district will be Japan’s biggest,
according to a joint statement released today.  Tokyo’s winning bid to host the Olympic Games is helping
accelerate the country’s property market that has already shown
showing signs of a rebound. The number of condominiums for sale
in Tokyo and surrounding areas rose 53 percent from a year
earlier to 4,145 units in August, the biggest same-month
increase since 1996, according to the Real Estate Economic
Research Institute.  Apartment prices in the Tokyo Bay area near the competition
venues may increase as much as 20 percent, according to an
estimate by Sanyu Appraisal Corp., a property appraisal company.  Across the site of the Kachidoki development is an area
called Harumi where Tokyo is planning for its biggest housing
complex in 42 years to lodge athletes.  Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802)  and  Nomura Real Estate Holdings Inc. (3231) 
are the other two developers to jointly develop the project,
according to the statement. The prices for the apartment tower,
which will be completed in December 2016, have not been decided,
it said. The other two buildings will have shops and office
space, Kajima’s Haga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
