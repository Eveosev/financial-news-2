Blumont Group Ltd. (BLUM) , the best
 performer  in  Singapore  this year, agreed to invest A$116 million
($110.4 million) in  Discovery Metals Ltd. (DML)  in a deal that could
give it control of the copper producer.  Blumont will buy 73.1 million new shares at A$0.12 each in
Brisbane, Australia-based Discovery, it said in a statement. It
will also pay $100 million for 5-year convertible bonds that
would give Blumont as much as 60 percent of Discovery if fully
converted.  Discovery, which has a copper mine in Botswana, has slumped
93 percent in Sydney trading this year after a downgrade in
reserves and a takeover bid by Chinese billionaire Yu Yong’s
Cathay Fortune Corp. was abandoned. Investing in the copper
producer would be Blumont’s largest deal to date as it seeks to
acquire minerals and energy assets.  “We see good potential in the copper segment with rising
incomes and higher demand for consumer products and services
requiring copper,” Ines  Scotland , Chief Executive Officer of
Blumont Copper, a unit of Blumont, said in the statement. “We
continue to look for strategic partnerships that will give us a
global footprint into the copper resource space.”  Discovery will use the funds from the transaction to reduce
its debt and for development, exploration and working capital
expenses, Blumont said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
