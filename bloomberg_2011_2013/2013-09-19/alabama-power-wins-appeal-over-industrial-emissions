Alabama Power Co. (SO)  must face a U.S.
lawsuit claiming it violated the  Clean Air Act  by modifying
three coal plants without proper permits, a federal appeals
court ruled, reinstating a case dismissed by a trial judge.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Atlanta today said the lower
court abused its discretion by refusing to let two government
experts testify that the company should have expected the plant
modifications to “significantly increase” emissions and
therefore should have known it needed federal permits to make
them.  The government said it couldn’t continue the lawsuit
without the expert testimony and the district court dismissed
the case in 2011. The government and the Alabama Environmental
Council appealed.  “We disagree with the district court’s legal rationale and
analysis,” the appeals court said, sending the case back to
the district court for further proceedings.  Alabama Power may ask the appeals court for a rehearing,
Michael Sznajderman, a company spokesman, said. “We have always
complied with the law and have been falsely accused.”  The case is U.S. v. Alabama Power Company, 2:01-cv-00152-VEH, Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Atlanta).  To contact the reporter on this story:
