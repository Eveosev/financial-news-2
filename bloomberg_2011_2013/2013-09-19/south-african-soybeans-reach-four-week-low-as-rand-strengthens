Soybean futures traded in South
Africa reached a four-week low as a strengthening rand made
imports of the oilseed cheaper.  Soybeans for delivery in December, the most active
contract, fell for a fourth day to 5,515 rand ($573) a metric
ton by the close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. That was the contract’s lowest price since Aug.
21, and the streak of declines is the longest since June 19.  The rand gained for a fifth session to the highest level
since May against the dollar before erasing the advance. It’s
still down 12 percent against the greenback this year, the
second-worst performance in a basket of emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Only Argentina’s peso slumped
further, the data show.  “The rand was stronger earlier today,” Kobus Theron, a
trader at Suidwes Landbou (Pty) Ltd. in North West province,
said by phone. “The exchange rate was the main reason for the
drop.”  Corn futures also declined in Johannesburg trading. South
Africa is the continent’s largest producer of the grain. A meal
made from white corn is one of the nation’s staple foods and the
yellow variety is mainly used as animal feed.  Yellow corn for delivery in December dropped 0.6 percent to
2,118 rand a ton, the contract’s lowest settlement price since
Feb. 26. The white variety for the same delivery month fell 0.2
percent to 2,293.20 rand a ton, the lowest since July 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
