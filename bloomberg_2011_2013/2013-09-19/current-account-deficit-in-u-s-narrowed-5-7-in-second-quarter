The current-account deficit in the
U.S. narrowed in the second quarter to the lowest in almost four
years, helped by a pickup in exports and a bigger income
surplus.  The  gap , the broadest measure of international trade
because it includes income payments and government transfers,
shrank 5.7 percent to $98.9 billion, the smallest since the
third quarter of 2009, from a revised $104.9 billion shortfall
in the prior period, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
survey called for the deficit to shrink to $97 billion.  Improvement in overseas markets would bolster demand for
American-made goods and help restrain growth in the  trade gap ,
which is the biggest part of the current account shortfall. At
the same time,  U.S. economy  is outpacing  Europe  and parts of
 Asia , indicating further narrowing of the deficit will be
limited, underscoring the importance of foreign investment in
financing domestic demand.  Estimates (USCABAL)  of 41 economists in the Bloomberg survey ranged
from current account deficits of $103.8 billion to $90.6
billion. The first-quarter shortfall was revised from an
initially reported $106.1 billion.  The gap represented 2.4 percent of gross domestic product
last quarter, compared with 2.5 percent in the prior three
months. The deficit reached a record high of 6.2 percent of GDP
in the fourth quarter of 2005.  The trade deficit in  goods and services , which accounts for
most of the current-account gap, narrowed to $117.8 billion in
the April through June period from $122.6 billion in the first
quarter, today’s report showed.  The trade deficit in the U.S. widened in July from an
almost four-year low as imports rebounded and exports cooled.
The gap increased 13.3 percent to $39.1 billion from $34.5
billion in June that was the smallest since October 2009,
Commerce Department figures showed Sept. 4.  Overseas Income  Today’s report also showed U.S. income on overseas assets
increased to $192.5 billion in the second quarter from $191.6
billion in the prior three months. Foreign earnings on U.S.
assets, including wages and compensation, fell by $1.3 billion
to $139.4 billion.  The  surplus  on income payments rose to $53.1 billion from
$50.9 billion in the first quarter. U.S. investments overseas
generally yield more than the  Treasury securities  that foreign
investors prefer to buy, helping maintain the income surplus.  Payments by the U.S. government to foreigners and other
private transfers abroad  outpaced  official inflows from overseas
by $34.2 billion last quarter, compared with $33.1 billion in
the previous period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
