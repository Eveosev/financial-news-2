Warren Buffett , the billionaire
chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
said he’s struggling to find opportunities in equity markets
after stocks rallied.  “They were very cheap five years ago, ridiculously
cheap,” Buffett said today on CNBC. “That’s been corrected,”
he said. “We’re having a hard time finding things to buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
