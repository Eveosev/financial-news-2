OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest
lender, rose for a sixth day as the ruble surged after the U.S.
Federal Reserve unexpectedly refrained from cutting stimulus.  Sberbank jumped 3 percent to 102.58 rubles by 3:34 p.m. in
Moscow, the  strongest  intraday level since May 29 and bringing
the six-day rally to 7.4 percent. That’s the longest stretch of
gains since June 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
volume of shares traded was equivalent to more than 1.6 times
the three-month average. The bank, which accounted for about 45
percent of retail deposits in Russia as of April 1, added 5.2
percent to $12.93 in  London. (SBER)   The Fed yesterday said it wants more evidence of an
economic recovery before paring its $85 billion-a-month bond
buying program, spurring a rally in emerging-market assets. The
ruble advanced for a 10th day, appreciating 0.7 percent against
the dollar to 31.6135, poised for a record streak. That’s the
strongest level on a closing basis since May, when Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  stoked speculation the bond buying program would
be reduced, triggering a rout in developing-nation stocks.  “Banks should be outperforming the market today since the
ruble is strengthening,” Natalia Berezina, an analyst at
UralSib Capital in Moscow, said by phone. “The Fed’s decision
is positive since the easing will continue untouched for now.”  Sberbank’s second-quarter profit rose 4 percent to 86.5
billion rubles ($2.6 billion), missing estimates, as slowing
economic growth in Russia curbed demand for credit. The central
bank kept the  refinancing rate  unchanged last week, matching the
forecast of 14 out of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Today’s gain in Sberbank shares extended this quarter’s
rally to 9.7 percent, taking an advance this year to 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
