Jebel Ali Free Zone FZE, a business
park operator in Dubai, cut the price on a 4.4 billion dirham
($1.2 billion) Islamic loan by 1.25 percentage points,  reducing
rates after the emirate’s default risk fell.  Jebel Ali Free Zone and Dubai Duty Free, the world’s
biggest’ airport retailer, are among companies in the emirate
that have lowered rates on their loans. Dubai’s five-year credit
default swaps, contract insuring the sheikhdom’s debt against
default, plunged 212 basis points to 188, since the beginning of
June 2012 as three state-controlled companies repaid or rolled
over about $3.75 billion of debt, according to data from CMA.  Jebel Ali’s interest rate on the loan raised last year will
fall to 3 percent above the  Emirates interbank offered rate 
starting this month from 4.25 percent, Chairman Hisham Abdullah
Al Shirawi said in the result’s  statement  to Nasdaq Dubai today.
Dubai Duty Free cut the price on the dollar portion of a $1.75
billion loan by 0.75 percentage point and on the dirham portion
by 1 percentage point, a banker familiar with the deal, said in
July. Both paid a margin of 3.25 percent.  Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC (ADIB) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Dubai Islamic
Bank PJSC (DIB) ,  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) ,  Mashreqbank PSC (MASQ) ,  Samba Financial
Group (SAMBA) ,  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and  National Bank of Abu Dhabi
PJSC (NBAD)  provided Jebel Ali’s eight-year amortizing loan, according
to the company’s bond prospectus issued last year.  Jebel Ali’s first-half profit rose 47 percent to 311.3
million dirhams as revenue increased.  To contact the reporters on this story:
