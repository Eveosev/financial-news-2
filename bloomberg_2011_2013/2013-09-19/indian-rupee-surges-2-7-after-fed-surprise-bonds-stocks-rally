India ’s rupee jumped 2.7 percent to
a one-month high after the U.S. unexpectedly refrained from
cutting stimulus that’s buoyed emerging-market assets. Bonds and
stocks rallied.  The Federal Open Market Committee said yesterday it wants
to see more evidence of a recovery in the world’s largest
economy before starting to taper its $85 billion a month of bond
purchases. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a
reduction of $5 billion. The committee is concerned that the
rapid tightening of financial conditions in recent months could
damp growth, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said at a press
conference yesterday in  Washington .  “The surprising Fed decision is naturally supportive of
risk appetite in  emerging markets ” and “the effect on the
current account-deficit countries could be larger,” Koon Chow,
head of emerging-market strategy at Barclays Plc in  London ,
wrote in an e-mailed note. “As their currencies rally, some of
the priced-in expectations of aggressive monetary tightening may
be unwound as well, with local bonds enjoying a lift.”  The rupee appreciated 2.7 percent to 61.71 per dollar as of
9:36 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 61.6525 earlier, the strongest
level since Aug. 16.  The yield on the 7.16 percent Indian sovereign notes due
May 2023 slumped 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to
8.18 percent, according to the central bank’s trading system.
That’s the lowest level since Aug. 8. The 30-stock  S&P BSE
Sensex (SENSEX)  of local shares climbed 2.7 percent to 20,501.54, poised
for its highest close since January 2011.  Fed Outlook  The Fed left unchanged its outlook that its target interest
rate will remain near zero “at least as long as” unemployment
exceeds 6.5 percent, so long as the outlook for inflation is no
higher than 2.5 percent, according to a statement. The U.S. will
release jobless claims and existing home sales reports later
today.  The Reserve Bank of India will review policy tomorrow after
government data this week showed  wholesale-price  inflation
unexpectedly rose to a six-month high of 6.1 percent in August.
Governor Raghuram Rajan will leave the benchmark repurchase rate
unchanged at 7.25 percent, according to all 36 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Overseas funds sold a net $84.9 million of Indian bonds on
Sept. 17, after pulling out $213.5 million on Sept. 16, which
was the most in three weeks, exchange data show. They have
reduced  holdings  of Indian notes by more than $10 billion since
May 22, when Bernanke first flagged a potential paring of asset
purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
