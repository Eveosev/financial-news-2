Wimbledon champion  Andy Murray  will
undergo minor surgery on his back, and may miss the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals tennis tournament in  London .  Murray, the third-ranked man in the ATP tour, is trying to
“clear up a long-standing back problem,” according to a e-mailed statement from 77 Group, his management company.  The 26-year-old won four titles this year, including the
grass-court major at the All England Club in July. He could miss
several tournaments, including Masters events in Shanghai and
Paris and the ATP finals, where the top-ranked 8 men play for
the title in November. Murray lost to Stanislas Wawrinka of
 Switzerland  last month in the quarterfinals of the  U.S. Open ,
where the British player was defending the title.  “The issue flared up again during the Rome Masters this
year when Andy was forced to retire and he sought advice from a
range of specialists in May,” the statement said. “After a
successful return on the more forgiving grass courts, Andy
enjoyed success at Queen’s and Wimbledon, but after recently
playing on hard-courts and clay, Andy once again sought medical
advice about solving the issue once and for all. The aim is to
be fully fit for the new season.”  Murray quit the Rome Masters during his match with Spain’s
Marcel Granollers in May.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
