With Emirates Team  New Zealand 
still one win away from capturing the America’s Cup, the second
of today’s two races on San Francisco Bay was postponed until
tomorrow because of strong wind.  Oracle Team USA won today’s earlier race by 31 seconds to
pull within 8-2 in the best-of-17 series. New Zealand needs one
more race win to clinch the 162-year-old sailing trophy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
