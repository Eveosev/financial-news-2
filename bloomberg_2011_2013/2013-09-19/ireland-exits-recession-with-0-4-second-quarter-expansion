Ireland’s economy expanded in the
second quarter, exiting its second recession since 2008 when a
decade-long real-estate boom imploded.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.4 percent from the previous
three months, when it fell 0.6 percent, the  Central Statistics
Office  said in a report published in Dublin today. Economists
had estimated a 1 percent expansion, according to the median of
nine estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. GDP fell 1.2 percent
from a year earlier.  Ireland is seeking this year to become the first nation to
exit a bailout since the euro-region crisis began. The  finance
ministry  said on Sept. 10 there may be “some downside
potential” to its forecast for 1.3 percent economic growth for
the full year.  Improving indicators, including payrolls, production,
retail sales and house prices “point to a stronger second-half
outturn for the Irish economy,” Philip O’Sullivan, an economist
at Investec Plc in Dublin, said in a note on Sept. 17.  Growth in the second quarter was helped by a 4.3 percent
increase in exports and a 0.7 percent gain in  consumer spending .
Imports rose 0.7 percent, while  government spending  fell 1.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
