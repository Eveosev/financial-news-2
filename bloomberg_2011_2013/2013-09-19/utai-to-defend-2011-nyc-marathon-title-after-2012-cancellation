Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya will defend
his 2011 title at this year’s  New York City Marathon , which was
canceled for the first time a year ago in the aftermath of
 Hurricane Sandy .  Mutai’s challengers will include reigning Olympic and World
Championships winner Stephen Kiprotich and 2012  Boston  Marathon
champion Wesley Korir, both from  Uganda .  Defending women’s NYC Marathon winner Firehiwot Dado of
 Ethiopia  will also be back for the Nov. 3 race, organizers said
in a statement announcing the event’s international professional
runners. Dado’s top competition will include two-time world
champion Edna Kiplagat of Kenya, who won the New York City race
in 2010.  Last year’s NYC Marathon was canceled two days before the
race amid criticism that staging the event so soon after
Hurricane Sandy devastated parts of the city on Oct. 29 would
drain resources. About 47,000 participants had registered for
the race, including about 20,000 from overseas, according to the
 New York  City Road Runners, which organizes the event.  Mutai, 31, won the 26.2-mile (42.2 kilometer) NYC Marathon
two years ago in 2 hours, 5 minutes, 6 seconds, eclipsing the
course record by 2 minutes, 37 seconds. That came seven months
after he ran the fastest marathon in history in Boston, at
2:03:02.  “I am confident and looking forward to challenging myself
with my own course record set in 2011,” said Mutai, the 2011-12
World Marathon Majors series champion. “I look forward to
coming back to the city where I am welcomed by many people who
make me feel at home.”  Other top men’s runners in the field include 2012 Paris
Marathon winner Stanley Biwott and 2012 NYC Half-Marathon winner
Peter Kirui, both of  Kenya ; two-time Olympian Jose Manuel
Martinez of Spain; and NYC Half-Marathon runner-up Masato Imai
of Japan. The women’s field includes 2012 Olympic Marathon
silver medalist Priscah Jeptoo of Kenya, 2005 and 2006 NYC
Marathon champion Jelena Prokopcuka of  Latvia  and 2011 NYC
Marathon runner-up Buzunesh Deba of Ethiopia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
