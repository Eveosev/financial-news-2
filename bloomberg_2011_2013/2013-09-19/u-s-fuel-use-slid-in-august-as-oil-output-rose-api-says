U.S. fuel consumption slipped in
August as crude-oil production surged to the highest level for
the month in 25 years, the  American Petroleum Institute  said.  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, slipped 0.7 percent from a year earlier to 19.1 million
barrels a day, the industry-funded group said today. It was the
lowest level for August since 2009. Year-to-date consumption has
averaged 18.7 million barrels a day, up 0.4 percent from 2012.  Demand for gasoline dipped 0.9 percent to 9.05 million
barrels a day last month, the report showed. Consumption of jet
fuel slipped 0.3 percent from a year earlier to 1.46 million
barrels a day in August. Demand for residual oil, used for
commercial and industrial heating, electricity generation and
ship propulsion, dropped 3.8 percent to 340,000 barrels a day.  “August saw a continuation of trends that have been
building for quite some time,”  John Felmy , chief economist with
the Washington-based API, said in the report. “The incredible
rise in American energy production, helped in part by softening
demand, has allowed the  United States  to dramatically increase
energy exports and reduce its energy imports.”  Consumption of distillate fuel, the category that includes
diesel and heating oil, gained last month. Diesel demand rose 3
percent to 3.66 million barrels a day in August while ultra-low-sulfur diesel use climbed 2.2 percent to 3.63 million. Heating
oil use declined 11 percent to 164,000 barrels a day.  U.S. Production  U.S. crude-oil production increased 20 percent to 7.59
million barrels a day. A combination of horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies in
shale formations in  North Dakota ,  Texas  and other states.  Production of natural gas liquids, which are a byproduct of
gas drilling, surged 6 percent to 2.51 million barrels a day
last month, a record for August and the third-highest monthly
level ever, according to the report.  Total oil and fuel imports dropped 10 percent in August to
9.81 million barrels a day, an 18-year low for the month, the
API said. Fuel exports climbed 16 percent to 3.5 million barrels
a day, the highest August level ever and 42,000 barrels short of
June’s record, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
