Mediobanca SpA (MB)  sold 95.3 million
euros ($129 million) of securities tied to the Euro Stoxx 50
Index, its largest structured note offering linked to equities
in four and a half years.  Italy’s biggest publicly traded investment bank issued six-year notes on Sept. 16 that yield 3.5 percent for two years,
then switch to a payment tied to the index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Investors receive 6 percent if the  Euro
Stoxx 50 (SX5E)  is more than 3199.8 compared with 2941.8 today, or else
there’s no coupon.  Stefano Tassone, a spokesman for the bank in Milan,
declined to comment on the notes.  Mediobanca sold $509.5 million of structured notes in six
offerings this year, up from $103.4 million in the same period
of 2012 and its highest total in three years, Bloomberg data
show. Sales from the Milan-based bank are climbing as other
Italian such as  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  and UniCredit SpA, which
were among the 10 largest issuers in Europe and Asia in 2009,
decrease issuance.  Mediobanca’s issue is its largest tied to equities since a
100 million euro note in February 2009 linked to the shares of
Enel SpA, Eni SpA and Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Bloomberg data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
