African currencies from Nigeria’s
naira to  Kenya ’s shilling strengthened and yields on the
continent’s dollar bonds fell after the  Federal Reserve 
refrained from reducing stimulus that has triggered a rally
across  emerging markets .  Fed policy makers led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
yesterday they want more evidence of lasting improvement in the
 U.S. economy  before paring the central bank’s $85 billion
monthly bond-buying program. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists was for a $5 billion reduction. Ten out of
24 African currencies tracked by Bloomberg gained against the
dollar, six were unchanged and eight weakened.  “The Fed produced a huge surprise,” Societe Generale SA
strategists, led by London-based Benoit Anne, wrote in an e-mailed note. “Emerging-market investors will move on and go on
a buying spree.”  Nigeria’s naira advanced as much as 1.2 percent to 160.13
per dollar and was trading 0.7 percent stronger at 160.95 as of
12:58 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, set for its highest
closing level since Aug. 14. Zambia’s kwacha jumped 0.9 percent
to 5.245 per dollar, set for its best close since May, while
Kenya’s shilling climbed 0.3 percent to 87.20 per dollar,
heading for its best close since July 19.  Kenya, East Africa’s largest economy plans to raise at
least $1.5 billion this year in its first sale of dollar bonds,
following other sub-Saharan African nations including Zambia and
Rwanda selling dollar-denominated debt, which will help plug a
 budget deficit  and finance construction of ports, railways and
power-generation projects.  Kenya Cheer  The Fed holding off on paring bond purchases is also “good
news” for Kenya’s expected Eurobond sale,  Charles Robertson ,
the London-based chief global economist at  Renaissance Capital ,
wrote in an e-mailed note today. “It might reduce the yield by
50 basis points, so Bernanke may have saved Kenya $75 million
over the 10-year lifetime of a $1.5 billion Eurobond.”  Yields on Zambia’s $750 million of international debt
maturing September 2022 fell 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage
point, to 7.24 percent, while borrowing costs on Ghana’s $1
billion Eurobonds due October 2023 declined eight basis points
to 8 percent. The rate on 10-year Nigerian dollar-denominated
notes slid 12 basis points to 6.13 percent, the lowest since
Aug. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
