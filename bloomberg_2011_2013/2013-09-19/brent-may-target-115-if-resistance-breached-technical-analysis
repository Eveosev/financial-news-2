Brent crude  may rise to as high as
$115 a barrel by the end of the month if it breaks through
technical resistance at last week’s peaks of about $112,
according to Barclays Plc.  A gain above $111.93 a barrel is required to “re-open the
bullish potential” toward $114 and $115, the bank said in an e-mailed report dated yesterday. Brent settled at a six-month high
of $116.61 last month as  Libya ’s crude production slumped and
concern mounted that violence in  Syria  may spread and disrupt
Middle East oil exports.  “Prices are expected to remain at current levels with an
upward bias in September” and the fourth quarter, Miswin Mahesh, a commodities analyst at Barclays Plc in  London , said in
a separate report today. A supply shortfall and moderate demand
from countries outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development will support a tighter market balance, he said.  Brent for November settlement rose as much as 50 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $111.10 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange today and was at $110.90 at 2:53 p.m. Sydney
time. The contract advanced $2.41, or 2.2 percent, to $110.60
yesterday as the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained its economic
stimulus. Prices climbed 5.9 percent in August to cap a third
monthly gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
