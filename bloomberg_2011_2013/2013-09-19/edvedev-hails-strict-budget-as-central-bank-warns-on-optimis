The Russian government adopted a
three-year budget marked by spending cuts and a tariff freeze at
state monopolies even as the central bank said the underlying
economic-growth forecasts were too optimistic.  The main risk for the budget, based on a forecast of 3
percent gross domestic product growth next year, is banks not
lending enough to companies and state monopolies reducing
investments after a 2014 freeze in state-regulated tariffs,
Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev said at the Cabinet meeting
today.  The world’s largest energy exporter’s economy is growing at
the slowest pace since a 2009 recession as weak global demand
depresses exports and investment. The government is freezing the
pay of public workers next year and plans to increase dividends
from state-owned companies starting in 2015.  “The budget turned out to be strict,” Prime Minister
Dmitry Medvedev said at the meeting in Moscow. “A lot has to be
done to turn this forecast into reality.”  The budget shortfall will be 0.5 percent of GDP in 2014 and
1 percent in 2015, exceeding earlier estimates as slower growth
curbs revenue from taxes and state asset sales, the Finance
Ministry said yesterday. The non-oil deficit will shrink to 8.4
percent of GDP in 2016 from 9.4 percent next year, it said.  GDP growth will accelerate to 3.1 percent in 2015 and 3.3
percent in 2016, according to Finance Ministry forecasts. The
ministry cut its estimate for this year’s expansion to 1.8
percent from the previous 3.7 percent.  Nabiullina’s Warning  Bank Rossii Chairman  Elvira Nabiullina  said an increase in
household tariffs next year agreed by the Cabinet will add 0.5
percentage point to the inflation rate, while she called Economy
Ministry projections for investment and inflation
“optimistic.” The central bank, which is targeting inflation
of 4.5 percent, would need to tighten monetary policy if
households are excluded from the tariff freeze, she said in
Moscow today.  Companies such as OAO Russian Railways object to the tariff
plan, with the rail monopoly saying a 2014 freeze on its freight
charges would prompt it to cut its investment program by 75
percent.  The budget is based on oil-price forecast of $93 a barrel
next year and $95 in 2015-2016, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov
said today, according to state news service Interfax. Inflation
is forecast at 5 percent next year and 4.5 percent in 2015-2016,
he said, according to Interfax.  To contact the reporters on this story:
