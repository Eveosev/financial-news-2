Regulators in the European Union
and U.S. must work together to harmonize rules requiring
derivatives to be centrally cleared, or risk creating a
“mess,” the U.K.’s top markets regulator said.  “The clear risk is that a patchwork quilt of national and
regional rules runs the risk of becoming unworkable,” Martin Wheatley, the chief executive officer of the Financial Conduct
Authority, said at a conference in  London  today.  “There’s also the linked danger that if every national
regulator follows suit, you soon create a tit-for-tat
environment where any one transaction, or participant, could
easily be subject to three, four or five different regulatory
regimes,” said Wheatley.  The U.S. and European Union brokered a deal deal in July to
resolve clashes in their regulation of the  $633 trillion  swaps
market. The accord broke a deadlock over whether the U.S. could
impose its rules on trades booked in  Europe . Banks and other
swaps traders said the deal reduces the chance they will be
forced to comply with conflicting regulatory regimes.  The accord only partly settled how swaps rules will apply
across borders and averted a regulatory crisis. Both sides have
said further negotiations would be needed on a range of issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
