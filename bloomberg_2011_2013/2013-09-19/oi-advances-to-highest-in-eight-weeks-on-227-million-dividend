Oi SA, the worst-performing
telecommunications service provider in  Latin America  this year,
rose to an eight-week high after the company’s board approved a
500 million-real ($227 million) dividend payout.  The company’s non-voting shares gained 3.9 percent to 4.78
reais at 1:06 p.m. in  Sao Paulo . A close at that level would be
the highest since July 26. It was the biggest gain on the
 Ibovespa (IBOV)  stock benchmark, which rose 0.2 percent.  Oi, which has tumbled 42 percent this year amid concern it
will reduce dividend payments that are the highest in the phone
industry, will pay out 30 centavos per share on Oct. 11 to
stockholders of record as of Sept. 27, according to a regulatory
filing after the market closed yesterday. Based on analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, the company’s projected
dividend yield is more than 13, compared with an average of 5.4
for the world’s 100 biggest telecommunications carriers.  “This company has been in so much trouble lately,
investors even thought it could simply cancel dividend
payments,”  Pedro Galdi , the chief analyst at brokerage firm
SLW, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “This amount
means a return of almost 9 percent considering yesterday’s
price, so it’s positive given the huge decline the shares
suffered this year.”  Oi’s drop in 2013 compares with a 9 percent decline in the
Ibovespa. The company posted a surprise  adjusted net loss  of 124
million reais in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
