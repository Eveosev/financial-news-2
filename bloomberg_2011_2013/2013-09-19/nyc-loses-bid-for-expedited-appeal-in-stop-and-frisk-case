New York City  lost a bid for an
expedited appeal of court-ordered changes to the police
department’s stop-and-frisk search policy.  The federal appeals court in Manhattan today said it
wouldn’t grant a quick hearing in two related cases that
challenge the department’s tactics. The appeals court did grant
the city’s request to hear the cases in tandem.  U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan ruled
Aug. 12 that the police department unlawfully targeted people on
the basis of their race and violated their constitutional
rights. On Sept. 17, she rejected the city’s request to delay
enforcement of her order while it appeals the decision.  Scheindlin’s rulings included appointing a monitor to
oversee the  New York City Police Department ’s stop-and-frisk
policies and ordering changes to the way the city trains,
monitors and disciplines police.  Michael Cardozo,  New York ’s corporation counsel, said in an
e-mailed statement that today’s ruling “has no bearing on the
merits or importance of the case.”  “We’ll be moving ahead with filing our brief as quickly as
possible,” he said.  New York Mayor  Michael R. Bloomberg  said after the rulings
Aug. 12 that the city benefited from the policy and that the
judge “ignored the real-world realities of crime.”  The mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News .  The cases are Floyd v. City of New York, 08-cv-01034; Ligon
v. City of New York 12-cv-02274, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
