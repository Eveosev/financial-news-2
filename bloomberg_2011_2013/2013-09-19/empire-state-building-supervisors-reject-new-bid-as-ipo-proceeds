Malkin Holdings LLC, the supervisor
of  New York ’s Empire State Building, rejected a $1.4 billion
offer for the title and lease to the tower and said it won’t
entertain any more alternatives to an initial public offering.  The Malkins, who earlier this month rejected bids for
interests in the skyscraper, said in a regulatory filing today
that the $1.4 billion offer’s potential value would be
materially less to investors. The company is “fully committed”
to proceeding with an IPO of Empire State Realty Trust Inc.,
which would hold the tower and 20 other New York-area
properties.  Thor Equities LLC, run by Joseph Sitt, last week offered
$1.4 billion for the title to the 102-story tower, according to
a letter from Stephen Meister, an attorney representing
investors opposed to the IPO.  Lazard Ltd. acted as the Malkins’s independent adviser in
evaluating the bids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
