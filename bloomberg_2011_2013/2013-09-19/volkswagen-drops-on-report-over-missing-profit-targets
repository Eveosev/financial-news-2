Volkswagen AG (VOW)  dropped as much as
3.3 percent after Manager Magazin said Europe’s largest
automaker may miss profit goals as costs climb and sales growth
slows. The German vehicle manufacturer denied the report.  VW, the  biggest decliner  today in the 14-member Eurostoxx
autos and parts index, fell as much as 6.05 euros to 175 euros
and was down 2 percent at 4:58 p.m. in  Frankfurt . Trading volume
was more than triple the three-month daily average.  Chief Financial Officer Hans Dieter Poetsch is concerned
that the automaker won’t meet 2015 targets and is looking to cut
costs by about 1,000 euros ($1,355) per vehicle, the German
monthly magazine reported today, without citing the source of
the information.  “The suggestion that Volkswagen isn’t committed to its
targets is false,” the Wolfsburg-based carmaker said in an e-mailed statement. “Volkswagen completely stands behind its
statements about the future development of the company.”  Volkswagen has budgeted investments of 50.2 billion euros
in the automotive division through 2015 to help it surpass
 General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  as the world’s biggest
automaker by 2018. The company has a target of generating pretax
profit equivalent to at least 8 percent of sales by 2018 as
well.  ‘Difficult Phase’  “The trends show VW heading for a difficult phase for the
first time in years,” and the Manager Magazin report reinforces
that, said  Juergen Pieper , an analyst with Bankhaus Metzler in
Frankfurt. The sales momentum in the past two months has become
“clearly weaker.”  The VW car brand, the manufacturer’s biggest unit by
vehicle sales, is forecast to lift its operating margin to more
than 6 percent of revenue from 3.5 percent last year, according
to a Sept. 9 presentation by Poetsch. The Seat division, which
posted an operating loss of 156 million euros last year, has a
target margin of more than 5 percent. The Skoda nameplate will
have a margin of 6 percent to 8 percent, after posting 6.8
percent in 2012. The presentation didn’t give a time frame for
reaching the goals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
