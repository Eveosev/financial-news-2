The University of Pennsylvania
reported a 14.4 percent return on its investments in the year
ended in June, up from a 1.6 percent gain a year earlier.  The endowment’s value grew to $7.7 billion from $6.8
billion the previous year, the Philadelphia-based Ivy League
school said today in a statement. The investment gains were
driven by the performance of equity markets and the university’s
absolute-return portfolio, it said.  Foundations and endowments had a one-year median return of
11.28 percent in the year ended June 30, led by domestic
equities and bonds, Wilshire Associates said in an Aug. 6
report. That’s up from an annual increase of 0.38 percent
through June 30, 2012.  The  Massachusetts  Institute of Technology in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, said this week its endowment grew to a record
$10.9 billion after an 11.1 percent increase on investments
through June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
