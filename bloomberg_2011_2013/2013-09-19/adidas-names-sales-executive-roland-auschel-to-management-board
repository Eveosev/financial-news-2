Adidas AG (ADS)  appointed Roland Auschel
to its management board with responsibility for global sales for
the world’s second-biggest maker of sporting goods.  German-born Auschel, 50, joined Adidas in 1989 as a
strategic planner before becoming managing director for Germany,
Austria and Switzerland and head of Europe, the Herzogenaurach,
Germany-based company said today in a statement. His most recent
position was head of sales for multichannel markets.  Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Hainer  will retain
responsibility for  North America , the company’s  largest market ,
Adidas said. Auschel’s appointment takes effect on Oct. 1  and
increases the size of the executive board to five members from
four.  “With this appointment, Adidas underlines its mission to
be the leading sales organization in the sporting goods industry
across all sales channels,” the company said.  Adidas cut its 2013 revenue  forecast  last month because of
what the company described as “lackluster” sales of sporting
goods in Europe and unfavorable movements in currencies after
reporting second-quarter profit that trailed analysts’
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
