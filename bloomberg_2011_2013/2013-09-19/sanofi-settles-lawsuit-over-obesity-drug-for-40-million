Sanofi (SAN)  agreed to pay $40 million to
settle a lawsuit by investors who alleged they were misled about
the likelihood that the company’s Zimulti weight-loss drug would
win regulatory approval.  The money will go to investors who bought the French
drugmaker’s American depositary receipts from Feb. 24, 2006, to
June 13, 2007, according to the settlement agreement filed today
in federal court in  Manhattan . Sanofi didn’t admit any
wrongdoing as part of the settlement.  Sanofi, based in Paris, was accused in the November 2007
complaint of violating U.S. securities laws by failing to
disclose data about Zimulti’s link to suicidal behavior. A Food
and Drug Administration panel in June 2007 rejected the pill,
sending company shares to their biggest drop in three years.  France ’s largest drugmaker, which once expected the
medicine to generate about $3 billion in annual revenue, pulled
its application for U.S. approval after a committee of FDA
advisers found that Sanofi’s safety data were insufficient and
that the weight lost in clinical trials didn’t justify the
danger of psychiatric or neurological side effects.  The case is In re Sanofi-Aventis Securities Litigation,
1:07-cv-10279, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New
York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
