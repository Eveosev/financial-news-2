The International Monetary Fund
sees continued sluggish global growth as it reviews its
forecasts, Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.  “The IMF will release its updated forecasts in a few
weeks,” Lagarde said in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, according to her prepared remarks. “For now, let me
say that while we are seeing some signs of recovery, global
growth remains subdued.”  The fund will release its new predictions Oct. 8, three
months after cutting its global forecasts to 3.1 percent this
year and 3.8 percent in 2014. Since then, developed economies
such as the U.S. have become growth engines while some of their
emerging-market counterparts decelerate, the fund staff said in
a  note  to Group of 20 nations this month.  Lagarde also said the U.S. economy’s growth rate would be
below 2 percent this year, and about one percentage point more
next year. The country must fix its public finances, amid
political uncertainty about the budget and the debt ceiling, she
said.  On monetary policy, “our advice is that exit from
unconventional monetary policies should be gradual, linked to
progress in the recovery and employment, and that it should be
clearly communicated and in a dialogue,” Lagarde said a day
after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly refrained from cutting
monetary stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
