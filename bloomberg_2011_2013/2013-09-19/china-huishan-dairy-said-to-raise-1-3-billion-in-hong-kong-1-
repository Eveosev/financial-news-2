China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co. ,
the milk producer backed by billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , and
shareholders raised $1.3 billion in an initial public offering
in Hong Kong, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  Huishan Dairy and investors sold 3.8 billion shares at
HK$2.67 apiece, the top end of a marketed range, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private. The shares were originally offered at HK$2.28 to
HK$2.67 each, according to an IPO  prospectus .  Huishan Dairy, based in Shenyang city in northeast China,
was the first Hong Kong IPO of at least $1 billion to raise the
maximum sought since July 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  jumped as much as 1.8 percent
today to a seven-month high after the  Federal Reserve  refrained
from cutting stimulus.  The company completed the biggest  Hong Kong  IPO since May,
when Sinopec Engineering Group Co. raised $1.8 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The share sale values
Huishan Dairy at 17 times estimated 2014 earnings, the people
said. The company will start trading on Sept. 27, the prospectus
shows.  China Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd. (1117) , the countryâ€™s biggest
raw-milk producer, trades at 17.4 times estimated 2014 profit,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The company, which raised $447
million through a Hong Kong IPO in November 2010, has fallen 5.5
percent from its offer price, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
