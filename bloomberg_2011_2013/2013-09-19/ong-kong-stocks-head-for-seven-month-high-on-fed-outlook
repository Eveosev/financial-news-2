 Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index headed for its highest in more than seven
months, after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly refrained from
cutting record stimulus.  The Hang Seng Index gained 1.8 percent to 23,533.12 as of
9:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, poised for its highest close since Feb.
4. All but two shares rose on the 50-member gauge. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known as the H-share index,
advanced 2.1 percent to 10,811.88. The city’s markets are shut
tomorrow for a holiday.  Futures on the S&P 500 climbed 0.1 percent today. The U.S.
equity gauge surged to a record yesterday in New York after Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his colleagues maintained an $85
billion monthly pace of bond buying. The central bank said  it
wants to see more more evidence that improvement in the U.S.
economy and warned that an increase in interest rates threatened
the recovery. Analysts had predicted a $5 billion reduction,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The Fed said its target interest rate will remain near zero
as long as unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent, provided the
outlook for inflation is no higher than 2.5 percent. The  jobless
rate  was at 7.3 percent in August.  The H-share index entered a bull market last week after
rebounding more than 20 percent from a June low, while the  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  erased its 2013 loss. Shares climbed as  China ’s
economic data including exports and factory activity added to
signs that growth in the world’s second-biggest economy is
stabilizing. Hong Kong’s equity benchmark traded at 11.1 times
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 15.6 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  A preliminary gauge of China’s manufacturing due to be
released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics on Sept. 23
is expected to climb to 50.8 in September from 50.1 the previous
month, according to the median estimate of 13 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. A reading above 50 signal expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
