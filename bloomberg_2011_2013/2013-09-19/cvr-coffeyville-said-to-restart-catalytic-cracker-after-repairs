CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) ’s Coffeyville
refinery in  Kansas  restarted a fluid catalytic cracker shut more
than six weeks ago for repairs, a person familiar with
operations at the plant said.  The unit was halted in late July after a failure on the
flue gas coolers, Jack Lipinski, chief executive officer of the
the Sugar Land, Texas, company, said on an Aug. 1 conference
call with analysts. The equipment was supposed to be started in
the third week of August.  While the cracker was down, workers discovered that several
tubes in one of its heaters needed to be replaced, according to
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public. Those repairs were finished Sept. 13.  Angie Dasbach, a spokeswoman for CVR, said the company
doesn’t comment on daily operations.  Lipinski said on the call that CVR was taking advantage of
the catalytic cracker’s downtime to shut a crude unit for
repairs and cleaning. That unit has also been restarted, the
person said.  The Coffeyville  refinery  can process 115,000 barrels of
crude a day, according to the company’s website. It’s about 100
miles from Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for crude
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
