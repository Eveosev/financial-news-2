Wheat futures rose the most in
three weeks on signs of increasing demand for exports from the
U.S., the world’s biggest shipper. Corn prices climbed, and
soybeans fell.  In the week ended Sept. 12, export sales of wheat jumped 30
percent to 704,435 metric tons from a week earlier, topping
forecasts by traders, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed
today. Sales since June 1 rose to 17.1 million tons, up 38
percent from the same period last year, as futures fell 16
percent this year.  “Export business continues to improve,” Greg Grow, the
director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Demand needs to
continue to expand for additional gains.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 1.6 percent to
close at $6.57 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Aug.
26.  The price climbed after the Federal Reserve yesterday
unexpectedly refrained from reducing the pace of monthly bond
purchases, maintaining low borrowing and storage costs, Grow
said. The outlook for low  interest rates  may boost export demand
to build reserves, he said.  Yesterday, the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw
materials  rose 1.5 percent, the most in three weeks, and the
Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index  touched a seven-month low following
the statement by the U.S. central bank.  “The Fed decision may provide a lift to the commodity
cycle,” Grow said.  Corn futures for December delivery climbed 0.7 percent to
$4.595 a bushel in Chicago, the biggest gain since Sept. 10.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$13.395 a bushel on the CBOT.  Corn is down 34 percent this year, while soybeans dropped 5
percent, on signs of bigger U.S. harvests this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
