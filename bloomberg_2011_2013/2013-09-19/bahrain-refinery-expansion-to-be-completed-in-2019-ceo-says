Bahrain Petroleum Co. expects to
complete in 2019 an upgrade of its only refinery that will
increase its processing capacity by 35 percent, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Adel al-Moayyed said.  Bapco, as the company is known, plans to start work on
upgrading the Sitra refinery in 2015 to boost its capacity to
360,000 barrels a day from 267,000 barrels currently, he said by
phone yesterday.  Bapco, and Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or  Saudi Aramco , are in
final stages of approving work on enlarging a pipeline that
carries Saudi light crude to Sitra refinery by 120,000 barrels a
day to 350,000 barrels to feed the expansion, he said. The two
companies are expected to sign the contract for the pipeline
work by the end of this year, and complete that project in 2017,
he said.  Bahrain, the smallest and oldest Arab crude producer in the
Gulf, generates most of its income from selling refined products
abroad. The Kingdom, which began pumping crude in the early
1930s, also depends on  Saudi Arabia  for supplies of 150,000
barrels of Arab-medium grade crude from a shared field called
Abu Sa’afa. It sells this crude directly to the international
market.  The island nation was planning to spend as much as $350
million to increase the capacity of the pipeline link to 450,000
barrels a day and invest between $6 to $8 billion to support the
expansion of its Sitra refinery, Mohamed bin Khalifa Al-Khalifa,
chief executive officer of Oil & Gas Holding Co., said in April.  “The diminution in the project’s scale may well reflect
the company’s failure to bring a partner on board to share the
costs of the project,” the London-based Economist Intelligence
Unit said in a note dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
