Abengoa SA (ABG) , the Spanish developer
of solar-thermal power plants, will receive $33.6 million in
loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to buy Dow Chemical Co.
heat-transfer fluids for projects on two continents.  The liquids produced by Midland, Michigan-based Dow will be
used at two plants in Spain and one in South Africa, according
to an e-mailed statement today from the Washington-based bank.  Abengoa, based in Seville, Spain, operates two solar-thermal plants in Logrosan, Spain, and is building two in South
Africaâ€™s Northern Cape province, according to the statement. The
plants use mirrors to focus sunlight onto tubes containing a
heat-absorbing transfer fluid, which drives a steam turbine to
produce electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
