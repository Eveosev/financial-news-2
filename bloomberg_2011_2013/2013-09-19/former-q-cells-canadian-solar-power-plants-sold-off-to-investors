Global PVQ SE (QCE) , the company created
to take over the assets of Q-Cells SE after the German business
went bankrupt, sold seven solar-power facilities in  Canada .  The Rainy River First Nations, an indigenous group, bought
three plants with total capacity of 25 megawatts and Fiera Axium
Infrastructure Canada II bought four with 42 megawatts, Henning
Schorisch, administrator for Global PVQ, said in a statement.  The sale will bring “double-digit” million-euro income to
the company’s creditors by 2014, according to today’s statement.  Rainy River is based in Ontario, Canada’s largest province,
which is phasing out coal power plants with the help of a feed-in tariff for renewable sources including solar technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
