Namco Bandai Holdings Inc. (7832) , creator
of “ Tekken ,” expects earnings to rise to a record next
financial year on sales of toys and games including “Pac-Man.”  The company is targeting operating profit of more than 49
billion yen ($494 million) in the 12 months ending March 2015,
President Shukuo Ishikawa said in an interview at the Tokyo Game
Show yesterday, without providing detail. The company expects
profit of 40 billion yen this financial year.  Namco, which produces video games and trading cards, is
increasing the proportion of revenue from outside  Japan  to 30
percent from about  18 percent  as it drives products under brands
it owns and expands games for mobile devices. The Tokyo-based
company is in talks to buy popular intellectual properties in
 Europe  and the U.S., Ishikawa said, without identifying targets.  “Namco Bandai will be a strong presence in the mobile game
field moving forward,” analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led
by Masaru Sugiyama said in an Aug. 12 report. “Namco Bandai’s
contents have tremendous popularity in Japanese TV, film, toy,
and game genres and some, like Pac-Man, are popular overseas.”  New game consoles from Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. will
be “positive” for software makers such as Namco, Ishikawa
said.  Shares of Namco rose 3.3 percent to 1,798 yen in Tokyo
yesterday. The stock has surged 61 percent this year, compared
with a 41 percent rise in the benchmark Topix index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
