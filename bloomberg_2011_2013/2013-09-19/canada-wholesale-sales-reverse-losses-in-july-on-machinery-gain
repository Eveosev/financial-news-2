Canadian  wholesalers  boosted sales
in July, partly recovering from the biggest decline in receipts
in more than four years a month earlier.  Wholesale sales rose 1.5 percent to C$49.5 billion ($48.5
billion), after a revised 3.1 percent decline in June that was
the fastest since January 2009, Statistics  Canada  said today in
Ottawa. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News  survey  of 15
economists was for a 1.2 percent gain.  Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said in a speech in
 Vancouver  yesterday that growing confidence about global demand
is bringing about a “tipping point” where business investment
takes over from “tired” consumers in driving output growth.
The investment should boost Canada’s potential growth rate,
allowing the world’s 11th largest economy to expand more without
sparking inflation.  July’s advance was led by sellers of machinery and
equipment, who recorded a 3.2 percent gain, and a 4.3 percent
increase by building material wholesalers. Four of the seven
sub-groups, representing almost 70 percent of total sales,
recorded gains, the statistics agency said.  The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the impact of
price changes, rose 1.4 percent.  Inventories increased 0.1 percent to C$62.3 billion in
July, lowering the  ratio  of inventories to sales to 1.26 from a
four-year high of 1.28 in June.  Wholesale sales were 0.6 percent higher in July than the
same month  a year earlier .  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said the number of
Canadians receiving jobless benefits fell 2.1 percent in July.  The number of regular beneficiaries dropped by 10,900 to
503,920. From the year-ago month, the total number of
beneficiaries was down 5.7 percent.  To contact the reporter of this story:
