United Utilities Group Plc (UU/) , the
largest publicly traded water company in the U.K., rose today in
London trading after forecasting higher revenue and profit.  The Warrington-based water provider climbed as much as 2.8
percent to 710.50 pence at 2:01 p.m. local time after saying
first-half sales and earnings will be higher than a year earlier
despite a “tough economic climate.” Businesses demand less
water when not operating at full capacity.  The utility, whose prices for its water and sewer services
are reviewed by industry regulator Ofwat every five years, also
said in the trading statement that the company still plans to
invest about 800 million pounds ($1.29 billion) in
infrastructure and upgrades in 2013-2014.  United Utilities, which serves about 7 million people and
200,000 businesses in northwest  England , will report half-year
results on Nov. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
