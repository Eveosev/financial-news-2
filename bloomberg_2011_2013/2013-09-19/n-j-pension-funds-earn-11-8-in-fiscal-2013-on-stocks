New Jersey ’s public pensions
returned 11.8 percent for the 12 months ended June 30, led by a
surge in global stock prices.  The system, with 770,000 active contributors and retirees
in seven pension funds, had $73.3 billion in assets as of Aug.
31, according to a state Investment Division report. The figures
exclude returns from a fund for police and firefighter
mortgages.  The 11.8 percent gain follows an increase of 2.5 percent in
fiscal 2012. New Jersey’s fund performance, based on six-year
annualized returns, was 3.94 percent. That makes it the best-performing U.S. public pension fund among similar plans,
according to an analysis by the investment division.  ``We were way more defensively postured" in comparison to 
other funds' holdings, said Bob Grady, chairman of the State 
Investment Council, at its meeting in Trenton today ``This just
shows the division's done a very good job. It's a great chart."  New Jersey’s system outperformed teachers’ funds in Texas
and  Ohio , with returns of 3.41 percent and 3.08 percent,
respectfully, and the teachers and public-pension plans in
 California , with returns of 2.44 percent and 1.86 percent,
according to the six-year analysis.  For the most recent fiscal year, New Jersey’s pensions
earned 17.2 percent on domestic and international equity
holdings. The  Federal Reserve ’s third round of stimulus, coupled
with economic data showing improvements and housing gains, drove
the Standard Poor’s 500 Index up 18 percent in the same 12-month
period.  New Jersey’s pension funds lost 1.22 percent in August,
after a 2.37 percent gain in July. Estimated performance for the
year started July 1 was 1.13 percent, and for the calendar year
to date, 5.95 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
