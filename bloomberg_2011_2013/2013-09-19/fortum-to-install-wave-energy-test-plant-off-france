Fortum Oyj (FUM1V) , Finland’s biggest
utility, agreed to work with Paris-based engineer DCNS SA to
install an ocean-power project off Brittany in  France .  The two will build the 1.5-megawatt demonstration plant
with WaveRoller technology from Finland’s AW-Energy Oy, they
said today in a  statement . Fortum will own the facility and run
project development, while DCNS will manage construction.  “We can now bring together Fortum’s expertise in carbon
dioxide-free power production, DCNS industrial expertise in
marine energy, AW-Energy’s technology solution and the
commitment of La Region Bretagne,” Matti Ruotsala, Fortum’s
executive vice president for power, said in the statement.  Marine-energy developers are mostly still testing small
devices to gather data for larger machines and multi-turbine
projects yet to come to market. While no commercial-scale plants
operate, industrial companies including Alstom SA and  Siemens AG (SIE) 
are starting to invest in the industry.  Today’s deal means DCNS now works across three different
types of marine energy. The company agreed in June to
collaborate with Ocean Thermal Energy Plc on generating power
using differences in sea temperature. It also spent as much as
130 million euros ($176 million) buying a majority stake in
Irish tidal-turbine maker OpenHydro.  Fortum is also working with  Sweden ’s Seabased AB to build a
10-megawatt wave-power park off the country’s west coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
