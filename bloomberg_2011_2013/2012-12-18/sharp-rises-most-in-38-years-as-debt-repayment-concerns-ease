Sharp Corp. (6753) , Japan’s worst-
performing major stock, rose the most in at least 38 years in
 Tokyo  trading as concerns the company can’t pay its  debts  eased.  Sharp surged as much as 24 percent, the biggest gain since
at least 1974, and traded at 325 yen at the 11:30 a.m. break,
heading for the highest close since July 13. Sharp has declined
52 percent this year, the biggest drop on Japan’s benchmark
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) , which has gained 18 percent.  The TV maker, which said last month there was “material
doubt” about its ability to survive, reached an agreement this
month to sell as much as 9.9 billion yen ($118 million) of
shares to San Diego-based  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  Sharp turned to the
biggest maker of mobile-phone chips after failing to get a
planned 67 billion-yen investment from  Taiwan ’s Foxconn
Technology Group and hemorrhaging 103 billion yen in cash from
operations in the fiscal first half.  “There was an investment from Qualcomm and a report on
getting more banks for its lending plan,” Hideki Yasuda, an
analyst at Ace Securities Co. in Tokyo, said today. “That’s
clearing some of the concerns over Sharp’s ability to repay
debt. It seems more attention is focused on possible earnings
improvements than on bankruptcy risks.”  Sharp warned Nov. 1 about its ability to survive after
forecasting a record 450 billion-yen, full-year loss because of
sluggish demand for its panels. The company posted a record 376
billion-yen loss in the fiscal year ended March 31.  Cutting Jobs  Japan ’s largest liquid-crystal-display maker has 395
billion yen of notes outstanding, including 200 billion yen of
convertible bonds due September, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bonds were quoted at 77.15 yen per 100 yen face
value as of 11:16 a.m. in Tokyo today, the highest level since
Aug. 30, according to Tokyo Stock Exchange prices.  Resona Holdings Inc. (8308)  will join Japanese lenders offering
360 billion yen of emergency loans to Sharp, three bank
officials with knowledge of the matter said Dec. 11.  Sharp, which is cutting more than  10,000 jobs , secured 180
billion yen in collateralized loans through its main lenders
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
Ltd., it said Sept. 28. Osaka-based Sharp also got a 180
billion-yen credit facility that expires at the end of June.  Fitch Ratings  cut Sharp’s credit rating to junk last month,
saying it doesn’t foresee “any meaningful operational
turnaround in the company’s core business over the short- to
medium term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
