Russian equities gained for a third
day after crude oil rose and consumer stocks increased as
investors speculated retailers may be allowed to boost their
market share in the regions.  The 50-stock Micex Index added 0.8 percent to 1,481.84 by
the close in Moscow, the highest level since Oct. 2. Consumer
shares added 2.8 percent on average, the second-biggest advancer
among industry groups. OAO Dixy Group, a supermarket chain,
climbed as much as 6.4 percent on bets retailers may be allowed
to boost regional market share. OAO Pharmstandard added 4.7
percent, while OAO Magnit,  Russia ’s biggest food retailer,
increased 3 percent.  Oil, Russia’s chief export, gained 0.4 percent to $87.52 a
barrel. U.S. President  Barack Obama  proposed a budget plan that
would cut about $1.2 trillion in federal spending and raise a
similar amount in taxes, a person familiar with the talks said.  “Oil is strong,” Peter Szopo, head of research at  Alfa
Bank  in Moscow, said by phone. “Investors are hoping U.S.
lawmakers will be able to reach an agreement and that risk
appetite will increase.”  The Moscow Exchange added 20 new stocks to the ruble-
denominated Micex Index effective today, making its composition
identical to the 50-stock  RTS Index (RTSI$) , which will remain priced in
dollars. The amount of shares traded on the Micex was 20 percent
below the 100-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Financial Hub  The changes in the Micex’s composition, announced by the
stock exchange Nov. 22, are aimed at unifying the Micex and RTS
gauges as President  Vladimir Putin  pursues his goal of turning
Moscow into a global financial hub. The Moscow Exchange, created
in 2011 when the Micex Stock Exchange merged with the RTS
Exchange, offers stock, bond, currency and futures trading.  OAO Phosagro,  Europe ’s largest phosphate-fertilizer
producer, tumbled 2 percent to 1,249.90 rubles. Preferred shares
of OAO Bashneft oil producer rose 1.9 percent to 1,362.40
rubles. OAO Alrosa, a diamond producer, gained 1.1 percent to
27.466 rubles.  “Although investors are adding the 20 new stocks to their
portfolios, their weighting in the index is too small to be the
main driver,” Alfa’s Szopo said.  OAO Transneft, Russia’s oil pipeline operator, retreated
2.5 percent to 67,142 rubles, the biggest decliner.  OAO Rostelecom’s preferred shares climbed as much as 3.9
percent on a report the telecom operator may need to buy the
stock to keep state control. The shares closed up 1.4 percent at
90.98 rubles.  Rostelecom’s units may need to buy as much as 6.7 billion
rubles ($217 million) of preferred shares and convert them into
ordinary stock to keep the government’s stake above 50 percent,
Kommersant reported, citing proposals by  Renaissance Capital .  Norilsk, RusHydro  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of commodities increased 0.2
percent to 638.12. The RTS Index gained 1.4 percent to 1,511.43.
The Russian Depositary Index rose 0.6 percent to 1,705.88.  OAO RusHydro climbed 1.8 percent to 75.09 kopeks. The
hydropower company may pay more than 25 percent of net income in
dividends in five years, George Rizhinashvili, RusHydro’s deputy
chairman, said in a phone interview from Moscow today. The
company starts selling 10 billion shares at 1 ruble each
tomorrow.  OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel  added as much as 2.2 percent before
closing up 0.8 percent at 5,615 rubles, a March 19 high. New
Chief Executive Officer  Vladimir Potanin  told reporters
yesterday the miner will target dividends equivalent to at least
50 percent of its annual earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization with distributions made twice a
year starting in 2014. Norilsk posted Ebitda of $7.2 billion in
2011.  ‘User-Friendly’  American depositary receipts of the world’s largest nickel
and palladium producer jumped 3.8 percent yesterday in  New York 
to trade at 10.1 times estimated earnings, the highest valuation
since May 18, 2010. The ADRs have surged 16 percent in December,
the steepest gain on the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the
most-traded Russian companies in the U.S.  “Increasing the breadth of stocks will make the Micex a
more credible and user-friendly exchange,”  Roland Nash , chief
investment strategist at Verno Capital, which manages about $200
million in Russian equities, said by phone from Moscow on Dec.
5. “If they successfully implement the listings and it becomes
the central exchange for Russian stocks, then liquidity will
pick up.”  Dixy group jumped 5.1 percent to 394.12 rubles. Magnit
rallied 3 percent to 4,878.40 rubles.  Retailers, Regions  Russia’s antimonopoly watchdog may allow retailers to
exceed the 25 percent market-share limit if they build new
shopping areas, Interfax reported yesterday, citing  Igor Artemyev , head of the anti-monopoly service. At present
retailers can’t add outlets in a region if they have more than a
quarter of the area’s total trade volume.  The Micex trades at about 5.6 times  estimated earnings 
after adding 5.7 percent this year. That compares with a
multiple of 10.6 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index,
which has gained 14 percent.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg. Russia receives about half of its budget revenue from
oil and natural gas industry sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
