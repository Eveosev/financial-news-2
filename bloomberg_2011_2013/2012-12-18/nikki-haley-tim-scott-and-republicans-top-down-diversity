South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is single-handedly diversifying the
Republican Party. Haley, an Indian-American, just  appointed  Representative  Tim
Scott  to replace the state's departing senator,  Jim DeMint . Scott will be the
only black in the Senate. And South Carolina will have an Indian woman in the
governor's office and a black senator. That's remarkable. The Democratic Party incorporated black voters into the fold after
championing civil rights legislation in the 1960s, then gradually made room for
black elected officials. It diversified from the ground up. Republicans are
working in the opposite direction. The party rank and file is overwhelmingly
white. But Republican elected officials are increasingly diverse. Scott will
join Cuban-American Republicans Marco Rubio and  Ted Cruz  in the Senate. And in
addition to Haley, Republicans can point to Louisiana Governor  Bobby Jindal , and
Governors Brian Sandoval of Nevada and Susana Martinez of New Mexico. Blogger Glenn Reynolds  wrote : "So with Tim Scott's appointment, the GOP has
the nation's only black senator and both of its two Latino governors. Kinda
busts the racial narrative, doesn't it?" No, it kinda doesn't. Republicans have a long, long way to go to break out of
their self-created Caucasian ghetto. But Haley and company are putting the party
on a very promising path. (Francis Wilkinson is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.  Follow
