Green Mountain  Coffee Roasters Inc.,
the maker of Keurig single-cup pods and brewers, named former
Fortune Brands Inc. Chief Executive Officer Norman Wesley
chairman and added A.D. Mackay as a company director.  Mackay, 57, became a director on Dec. 12 and is the former
chief executive officer of  Kellogg Co. (K) , Waterbury, Vermont-based
Green Mountain said today in a statement. Wesley had been a
Green Mountain director and also served as Fortune Brands’
chairman.  In November, the coffee company named Brian Kelley as CEO
to succeed Lawrence J. Blanford, who retired. Green Mountain has
been facing increasing competition from private-label capsules
made by Kroger Co. and  Safeway Inc. (SWY)  that fit into Keurig
brewers.  The shares  gained  5.3 percent to $40.99 at the close in  New
York . Green Mountain has lost 8.6 percent this year.  Michael Mardy, who had served as interim chairman for Green
Mountain after founder Robert Stiller was removed earlier this
year, will continue as a director. Howard Malovany, Green
Mountain’s chief legal officer and general counsel, will step
down in March, the company said in a filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
