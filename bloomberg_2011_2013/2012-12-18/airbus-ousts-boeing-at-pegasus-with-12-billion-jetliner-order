Airbus SAS (EAD)  said Turkish low-cost
carrier  Pegasus Airlines  agreed to buy 75 A320neo series single-
aisle jetliners, with options for 25 more. The airline currently
operates a fleet built around  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s competing 737 model.  Pegasus’s order is valued at $12 billion including the
options, Airbus said today, with the Istanbul-based carrier
firmly committed to buying 58 A320neos and 17 larger A321neos.  The deal is the first for the reengined neo in the fast-
growing Turkish market and takes the backlog to 1,654 jets since
sales began two years ago. Deliveries will begin in three years
and run through 2022, with all Boeing planes slated to exit the
fleet by the following year, Pegasus Chairman Ali Sabanci said
in an interview in Istanbul, where the carrier is based.  “We’re delighted that Pegasus will be the first airline in
the world to switch from the Boeing 737-800 to Airbus,” Chris
Buckley, the manufacturer’s executive vice president for Europe,
Asia and the Pacific, said in an interview, adding that Airbus
has been working with the Turkish company for a decade, with
today’s deal stemming from a third attempt to sell it planes.  Turkish Expansion  Pegasus, Turkey’s largest carrier after state-owned  Turk
Hava Yollari AO (THYAO) , or  Turkish Airlines , operates a fleet of 42
Boeing aircraft, comprising 40 737-800s -- the single-aisle
mainstay of operations at discount carriers including  Ryanair
Holdings Plc (RYA) , Air Berlin Plc and  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NAS)  --
and two older 737-400s, according to the company’s website.  Turkish carriers have been adding overseas routes and
raising capacity on domestic flights as demand for travel grows.
That’s led to higher earnings even as airlines elsewhere suffer
a slump in business during the global economic slowdown.  Pegasus’s A320neos will be configured in all-economy layout
featuring 180 seats, with 220 on the A321s, and used on routes
in Europe and the  Middle East , according to the carrier.  A decision on engines will be made by the end of February
and may determine the date of the first delivery, Pegasus Chief
Executive Officer Sertac Haybat said in an interview. The neo
comes with turbines from  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt &
Whitney unit, available beginning in 2015, or  CFM International ,
a venture of  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA. (SAF) , due in 2016.  The Airbus purchase will be financed with export credit
from Britain, Germany and France, for which negotiations have
begun and are likely to conclude a year before the first
delivery, Sabanci said in the interview. There are no plans to
add wide-body planes to the fleet, the chairman added.  Pegasus, based at Sabiha Gokcen airport on the Asian side
of Istanbul, transformed into a discount carrier from a charter
operator in 2005 after its purchase by Esas Holding AS, which
also has health-care, retail, food and real estate investments.  The carrier, known as Pegasus Havayollari AS in Turkish,
currently serves 24 domestic and 38 foreign routes and carried
11.3 million passengers in 2011. It’s considering an initial
public offering for 2013 or 2014, Sabanci said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
