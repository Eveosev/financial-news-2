The rand  weakened for the first
time in three days as the market waited for results from  South
Africa ’s ruling  African National Congress ’s leadership election.  The currency declined as much as 0.3 percent and was
trading 0.2 percent weaker at 8.5591 per dollar by 9:35 a.m. in
Johannesburg. The rand strengthened 1.4 percent in the preceding
two days. South African markets were closed yesterday for a
public holiday. Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due
December 2026 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.34 percent.  The ANC ended voting for its top leaders with results
expected later today. President  Jacob Zuma  is the favorite to
win a second five-year term as head of the ruling party,
fighting off a challenge from his deputy,  Kgalema Motlanthe , who
yesterday dropped out of the race for the deputy post.  “There will be inherent discomfort” before the results
are announced, William van Rijn, a currency trader at Nedbank
Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said by phone. “Unsurprisingly,
given the long weekend locally and the resilience of the rand,
local importers have also taken advantage of current levels to
take some cover.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
