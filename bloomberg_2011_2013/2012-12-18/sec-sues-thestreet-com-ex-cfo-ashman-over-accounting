TheStreet Inc. (TST) , which operates the
financial website  TheStreet.com , and three former executives
were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over
claims of accounting fraud at the company.  The SEC filed three separate complaints in federal court in
Manhattan today against TheStreet, former Chief Financial
Officer Eric Ashman and two former co-presidents of a unit of
the company, Gregg Alwine and David Barnett.  TheStreet, co-founded in 1996 by CNBC host Jim Cramer,
reported in 2010 that the SEC was investigating the accounting
at its former Promotions.com unit. TheStreet acquired the online
promotional agency for $20.7 million in August 2007 and sold it
to a company owned by Promotions.com managers for $3.1 million
in December 2009, according to a company filing.  TheStreet fell 5 cents, or 3 percent, to $1.60 at 1:14 p.m.
