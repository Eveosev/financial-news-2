Thailand ’s baht touched a 10-week
high as optimism the U.S. is moving closer to resolving a budget
deadlock bolstered demand for emerging-market assets.  President  Barack Obama  is considering concessions after
House Speaker John Boehner dropped opposition to raising tax
rates for top earners, two people familiar with the talks said
after the officials met yesterday. Overseas investors  bought 
$285 million more Thai government bonds than they sold this
month through yesterday and pumped a net $426 million into local
equities, according to data from the Thai Bond Market
Association and the stock exchange.  “Most Asian currencies are responding modestly to
developments in the U.S.,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-
based economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “There’s nothing
compelling enough for the Thai baht to break 30.55 per dollar.”  The baht traded at 30.58 against the greenback as of 8:56
a.m. in Bangkok, compared with 30.59 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 30.55, matching
yesterday’s high that was the strongest level since Oct. 8, and
has gained 3.2 percent this year.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, dropped 80 basis points,
or 0.8 percentage point, to a 17-month low of 3.5 percent.  Government bonds were steady. The yield on the 3.125
percent securities due December 2015 was 2.97 percent, the
highest since Oct. 18, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
yield has advanced six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
