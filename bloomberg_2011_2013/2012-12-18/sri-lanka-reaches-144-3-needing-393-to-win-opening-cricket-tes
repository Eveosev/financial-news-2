Australia was frustrated by
resistance from Sri Lanka’s batsmen and rain delays in its bid
to win their series-opening cricket Test on the final day.  Australia took one wicket in each of the first two sessions
on day five in Hobart as Sri Lanka reached 186-4 at the tea
break needing a team-record 393 to force an unlikely victory.
Showers twice interrupted play after lunch.  Kumar Sangakkara  scored 63 off 226 balls to thwart the home
team’s attempts to take a 1-0 lead in the best-of-three contest
after the tourists resumed at 65-2. Thilan Samaraweera was 38
not out from 112 balls at the final interval, with Angelo Mathews taking 53 deliveries to reach 11.  Australian wicket-keeper  Matthew Wade  bowled the last over
before the break in an effort to end the partnership as batsman
Phil Hughes took his place behind the stumps. With a minimum of
36 overs remaining, the draw is the most likely result according
to Australian bookmaker  Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. (TAH)   Mahela Jayawardene was the only wicket to fall during the
morning session when Michael Clarke, who injured his right
hamstring yesterday, took a low catch at slip off  Peter Siddle ’s
bowling to dismiss his rival captain for 19. Siddle also trapped
Sangakkara leg-before-wicket.  Sri Lanka’s previous biggest fourth-innings total to win a
Test was 352-9 against South Africa in Colombo six years ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
