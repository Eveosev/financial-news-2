World production of oil from seeds
is forecast to decline for the first time in 20 years on lower
crushing of cottonseed, sunflower seed and rapeseed, industry
researcher Oil World said.  The output drop will boost demand for  palm oil , reducing
stocks of the oil extracted from palm-fruit pulp by September
next year even as its production rises 5.9 percent, the Hamburg,
Germany-based company wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Soybean oil futures have slipped 4.8 percent in  Chicago 
this year, while palm oil traded in  Malaysia  had slumped 26
percent in the same period on record Malay stockpiles. Crude
palm oil prices in Rotterdam are now $50 to $60 a metric ton
cheaper than  Brent crude , according to Oil World.  “Oils and fats markets will enter their transition phase
to relatively higher prices in coming weeks and months, as
stocks are likely to decline from the current record level,”
Oil World wrote. “Consumers worldwide are expected to become
more dependent on palm oil.”  Production of oil from 10 seeds will slip 0.3 percent in
2012-13 to 101.2 million tons, Oil World predicted. Output of
palm oil is seen climbing to 54.8 million tons from 51.7 million
tons.  World output of 17 oils and fats is forecast to increase
1.1 percent to 186.8 million tons, the researcher said. Usage is
forecast to rise to 187.9 million tons from 182.6 million tons
in 2011-12, lowering stockpiles to 21.4 million tons at the end
of September from 22.5 million tons a year earlier.  Consumption of palm oil is expected to jump 8 percent to
54.7 million tons in 2012-13 from 50.6 million tons the previous
year, driven by insufficient supplies of seed oils.  Oilseed Crushings  “Year-on-year reductions in crushings of rapeseed,
sunflower seed and other oilseeds, and reduced export supplies
of competing vegetable oils will raise the demand for palm
oil,” the researcher wrote.  The price decline of palm oil means the commodity has
become more attractive as a feedstock for energy production, Oil
World said. That could contribute to an accelerated drop of
stocks in the next three to four months.  “Increasing quantities of palm oil are likely to be burned
in  power plants  for electricity generation and heat,” Oil World
wrote. “In addition, palm oil has improved its attractiveness
as a feedstock for biodiesel production.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
