Colin Montgomerie , who won the
European PGA Tour’s money title a record eight times without
securing a major tournament victory, will enter the World Golf
Hall of Fame in May.  Montgomerie, 49, was elected on the International ballot
and will join  Fred Couples  and Ken Venturi among five inductees
to the  St. Augustine , Florida, hall next year.  Ken Schofield, who became the European Tour’s first
executive director in 1975 when the circuit had just 17 events,
was also selected today for induction in the Lifetime
Achievement Category.  Montgomerie, from Scotland, finished as the European tour’s
leading money winner seven straight times, starting in 1993, and
added his final money title in 2005.  A four-time European Player of the Year, Montgomerie won 31
European titles, the fourth-most in tour history, including
three straight European PGA Championships at Wentworth, England.
While he has 40 victories worldwide, he hasn’t been able to win
the Masters Tournament, U.S. or  British Open  or  PGA
Championship , golf’s four Grand Slam events.  Montgomerie was unbeaten in eight successive Ryder Cup
appearances from 1991, with a 6-0-2 mark in singles matches
during the team event between U.S. and European players. In
total, he had 20 wins, 9 losses and 7 ties in Ryder Cup matches.
He then captained the 2010 European team to victory at Celtic
Manor Resort in Wales, giving Europe a 6-3 record when he
participated in the biennial matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
