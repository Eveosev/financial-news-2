Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the Finnish mobile-phone
maker struggling to revive sales, rose to an eight-month high
after its chief executive officer was reported to signal that
Verizon Wireless may carry more of the company’s devices.  Nokia, whose flagship Lumia 920 smartphone is sold by  AT&T
Inc. (T)  in the U.S., may broaden its offensive in the country by
selling a high-end device through another operator, CEO Stephen Elop said in an interview, CNET  reported today . Nokia is
planning “a lot of exciting things with Verizon,” Elop said
according to CNET.  The Espoo, Finland-based mobile-phone maker is trying to
win back customers from  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and devices using
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android system to reverse a sales decline and
return to profit.  Verizon Wireless  is the largest U.S. wireless-
service provider.  The shares  gained  7.9 percent to close at 3.20 euros in
Helsinki trading, the highest level since April 11. Trading
volume was double the three-month daily average. Even with the
recent gains, the shares have declined 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
