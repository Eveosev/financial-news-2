California Treasurer Bill Lockyer
said he’ll propose that the state’s public pension funds, the
two largest in the U.S., sell off investments in firearm
manufacturers that make guns prohibited under state law.  The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, known as
Calstrs, with $155 billion of assets, has a stake in Cerberus
Capital Management LP, a private equity firm that owns Freedom
Group, the maker of the Bushmaster .223-caliber semiautomatic
rifle that police said was the primary weapon in the Dec. 14
shootings that killed 20 elementary school children in Newtown,
 Connecticut .  “Our investment branch is examining the Cerberus
investment to determine how best to move forward given the
tragic events,” a spokesman for the fund,  Ricardo Duran , said
in a statement.  The school shooting, the second deadliest in U.S. history,
has ignited a national debate over  gun control  and stricter bans
on assault rifles. California prohibits semiautomatic assault
weapons, specifically including the Bushmaster, and magazines
that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, according to
the Attorney General’s  website.   Lockyer, a board member of both Calstrs and the  California
Public Employees’ Retirement System , the biggest U.S. pension,
asked yesterday that both funds review their holdings to
determine how much they’ve invested in gunmakers. He said he
would then propose to divest those stakes.  A Calpers spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request
for comment on its holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
