Amgen Inc., the world’s largest
biotechnology company, is expected to plead guilty tomorrow to
federal charges, U.S. prosecutors said.  The company, based in  Thousand Oaks , California, is
scheduled to enter the plea in Brooklyn,  New York , according to
a notice today from prosecutors. The charges against the company
weren’t specified in the statement.  Robert Nardoza , a spokesman for Brooklyn U.S. Attorney
Loretta Lynch, declined to provide further details. Ashleigh Koss, a spokeswoman for Amgen, didn’t immediately return a call
seeking comment on the case.  Last month, the company disclosed in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that it expected to pay
$806 million to settle federal civil and criminal investigations
related to its sales and marketing practices that are pending in
the states of Washington and New York.  The company announced in October 2011 that it took a
$780 million charge to cover the costs of settling civil and
criminal probes into whether it engaged in improper sales of
drugs, including its Aranesp anemia medication. At least 15
states have sued the company and alleged that it encouraged
doctors to overbill third-party payers, including Medicaid, for
Aranesp prescriptions.  The case is U.S. v.  Amgen Inc. (AMGN) , 1:12-cr-00760, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
