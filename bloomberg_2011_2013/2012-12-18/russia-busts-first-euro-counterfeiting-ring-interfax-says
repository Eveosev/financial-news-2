Russian investigators broke up the
countryâ€™s first counterfeiting ring that produced fake euros,
Interfax reported, citing unidentified Interior Ministry
officials.  The group was producing the equivalent of about 40 million
rubles ($1.3 million) of euros, dollars and other currencies a
month, the Russian news service reported. The fake money was
used to fund extremists in the North Caucasus, Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
