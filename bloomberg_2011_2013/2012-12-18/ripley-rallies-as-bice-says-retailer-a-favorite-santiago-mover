Ripley Corp SA (RIPLEY)  rose the most in
almost eight weeks after local brokerage Bice Inversiones named
it one of its favorite stocks on the prospect of higher earnings
in 2013.  Shares of  Chile ’s third-largest department-store operator
advanced 2 percent to 465.29 pesos at the close in Santiago, its
biggest gain since Oct. 25. The Ipsa benchmark index increased
0.2 percent.  Bice added Ripley to its list of five favorite Chilean
stocks and reiterated a buy recommendation on the brokerage’s
view that margins in 2013 will improve after inventory problems,
a store fire and opening delays sapped profits.  “Despite the accumulation of ’one-time effects’ that are
affecting 2012 results, we conclude that Ripley’s shares are
undervalued,” analysts Aldo Morales and Rodrigo Jacob said in
an e-mailed note.  An improvement in Ripley’s Peru operations and the opening
of a mall entirely owned by the company will compensate for the
costs of new operations in Colombia, the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
