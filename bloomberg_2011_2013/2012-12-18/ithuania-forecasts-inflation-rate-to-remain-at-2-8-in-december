Lithuanian inflation under European
Union methodology will probably remain at 2.8 percent in
December from a year earlier, the statistics office said.  Consumer prices may decrease 0.2 percent from November as
clothing costs fell due to year-end sales, the office, based in
the capital, Vilnius, said today on its website.  Lithuania’s average annual inflation for 2012, as measured
by the EU’s harmonized consumer price index, will probably be
3.2 percent, the office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
