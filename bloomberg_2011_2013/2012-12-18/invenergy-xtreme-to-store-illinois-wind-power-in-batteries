Invenergy LLC, a closely held
renewable-energy developer, is installing Xtreme Power Inc.’s
storage systems at an Illinois wind farm to provide electricity
when the wind isn’t blowing.  The Grand Ridge wind farm in La Salle County, southwest of
 Chicago , will use lithium-titanate batteries capable of storing
1.5 megawatts of power, Invenergy said today in a statement.  The storage system will let Chicago-based Invenergy
“balance supply and demand” on the grid operated by PJM
Interconnection LLC, according to the statement. Terms weren’t
disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
