day after  China ’s central bank set a stronger reference rate and
amid speculation capital inflows will increase after the
government eased investment limits.  The People’s Bank of China raised the yuan reference rate
for a second day to near a two-week high and a government report
today showed new  home prices  increased in 53 of 70 major cities
in November. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. boosted its economic
growth forecasts for the current quarter and 2013, citing a
recovery in manufacturing. China announced on Dec. 14 measures
granting foreign sovereign wealth funds and central banks wider
access to local  capital markets .  “We are still positive on the yuan in view of the recent
economic rebound and potential for more capital inflows,” said
Irene Cheung, a currency strategist in Singapore at Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “The stock market has been doing
well too.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.04 percent
