Gold dropped to the lowest in more
than three months as signs that U.S. lawmakers may be closer to
a budget deal boosted equities and reduced demand for the metal
as an alternative asset.  House Speaker John Boehner and President  Barack Obama  are
negotiating to avert the more than $600 billion in tax increases
and spending cuts set to start in January. Obama proposed a plan
that would cut $1.2 trillion in federal spending and raise a
similar amount in taxes in the next decade, and House
Republicans will meet privately later today to hear details of a
backup plan being pushed by Boehner. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index of equities reached a two-month high.  “If we’re seeing something substantial come out of the
budget talks in terms of finally getting spending under control,
then that’s bearish for gold,”  Edward Meir , an analyst at INTL
FCStone Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview. “Gold
has its hay day when spending is out of control.”  Gold futures for February delivery lost 1.6 percent to
settle at $1,670.70 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal touched $1,662 earlier, the lowest for a most-
active contract since Aug. 31.  Trading volume today was 60 percent higher than the 10-day
average on the Comex.  The S&P 500 advanced as much as 1.2 percent to 1,447.32,
the highest since Oct. 19.  The prospect of a sweeping budget deal “takes some of the
crisis demand out of gold,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview.  Silver futures for March delivery dropped 1.9 percent to
$31.669 an ounce on the Comex, after touching $31.40, the lowest
since Nov. 7.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery lost 0.9 percent to $1,593.70 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery decreased 1.1 percent
to $690.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
