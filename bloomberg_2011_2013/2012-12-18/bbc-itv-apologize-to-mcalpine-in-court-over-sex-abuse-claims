British Broadcasting Corp. and  ITV
Plc (ITV)  apologized in open court to retired U.K. politician Alistair McAlpine, who was wrongly linked to pedophilia allegations.  “The disgraceful allegations should never have been
aired,” BBC lawyer David Attfield said at a hearing in London
today. “It accepts it cannot put back the clock and wishes to
express its genuine remorse for the harm it has caused him.”  BBC, the world’s largest public broadcaster, agreed to pay
McAlpine 185,000 pounds ($300,000) last month for an erroneous
report on current-affairs program “Newsnight” linking the
former Conservative party treasurer to abuse claims at child-
care homes in  Wales  in the 1970s and 1980s.  ITV also apologized to McAlpine at today’s hearing. The
U.K.’s largest commercial broadcaster and its morning-show host
Phillip Schofield paid him 125,000 pounds after a list of
accused pedophiles that wrongly included his name was passed,
live on air, to Prime Minister David Cameron.  “Neither ITV or Mr. Schofield intended to make the
allegations against Lord McAlpine,” Ian Felstead, a lawyer for
ITV, said. “They do accept full responsibility for the
broadcast and the harm and distress caused.”  McAlpine earlier this month also sued Sally Bercow, wife of
House of Commons Speaker John Bercow, over a post about him on
Twitter Inc.’s social-media service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
