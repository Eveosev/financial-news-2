Wheat rose for the second time in
three sessions on signs of progress in resolving a U.S. budget
dispute that threatened to slow the economy and erode demand for
commodities.  House Speaker  John Boehner  said today that he will push a
budget “plan B” measure that will include tax increases for
those making more than $1 million a year and that he hopes to
reach a broader deal with President  Barack Obama . A solution
will prevent $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax
increases and reduce concern that demand for raw materials will
decline. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw
materials climbed for the second time in three sessions.  “There’s more optimism than I’ve seen in a month as far as
a deal getting done,” Mike Zuzolo, the president at Global
Commodity Analytics in Lafayette,  Indiana , said by telephone.
“The funds had done a good job liquidating so the short traders
are buying back.”  Wheat futures for March delivery advanced 0.4 percent to
settle at $8.1125 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has risen 24 percent this year.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
