Mets said in a news release.  A left-handed thrower and right-handed hitter, Cowgill
batted .269 with one home run, two doubles and nine runs batted
in over 38 games for the Athletics in 2012. He hit .254 with
four homers, 37 RBI and 33 runs in 61 games in Sacramento.  Cowgill joins Mike Baxter,  Lucas Duda , Juan Lagares, Kirk Nieuwenhuis, Cesar Puello and Jordany Valdespin as outfielders
on the Metsâ€™ 40-man roster.  Marte, 21, batted .251 with nine homers, 20 doubles, three
triples, 61 runs scored and 58 RBI in 129 games for double-A
Binghamton last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
