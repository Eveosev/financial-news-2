European Union regulators are
probing a unit of Caixa Geral de Depositos SA over dividend
payments which they said may be a misuse of rescue aid.  Caixa Geral Finance Ltd. paid 405,415 euros ($534,600) in
dividends on perpetual preference shares to institutional
investors without the consent of the European Commission, the
Brussels-based authority said in an e-mailed statement today.  Regulators in June approved Caixa Geral de Depositos to
receive 1.65 billion euro in Portuguese bailout funds on
condition that it abstain from any payments to holders of
capital instruments, the EU said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
