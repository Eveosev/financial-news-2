The  World Bank  said it is planning
to lend $900 million to Iraq over the next four years under a
plan designed to help the country create jobs and build stronger
institutions.  The loans are part of an economic strategy for the oil-
producing country that was discussed today by the lender’s board
of directors, the bank said in an e-mailed statement.  “As a conflict-affected state, Iraq remains fragile, and
its economy is dominated by a large public sector due to a
legacy of centralization,” the Washington-based bank said.
“Proper management of Iraq’s vast oil wealth and human
resources, coupled with a conducive and efficient investment
climate, will be key to inclusive growth and job creation.”  Iraq is reviving its  energy industry  nine years after the
U.S.-led invasion that toppled  Saddam Hussein , with oil
production increasing the most this year since 1998. The plan
adopted today, which was conceived with the Iraqi government,
will help the country manage its resources more efficiently and
diversify its economy, according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
