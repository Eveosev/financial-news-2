Sweden’s power grid operator isn’t
making enough provision for the growth in electricity from  wind
turbines , putting the nation’s renewable energy goals at risk,
the Swedish Wind Energy Association said.  The capacity outlined in October by system operator Svenska
Kraftnaet AB’s in a plan through 2025 is too low, the lobby
group said today in a statement.  Svenska Kraftnaet will be able to handle 17 to 20 terawatt-
hours of wind power annually, according to the plan. That’s
short of the government target of accommodating 30 terawatt-
hours as early as 2020.  “We share the association’s view that long lead times for
boosting transmission grids is a problem, something which is
unfortunately out of our hands,” Viktor Wallstroem, spokesman
for the grid company, said today by phone from  Stockholm .  Sweden is required by the European Union to raise the
proportion of renewable energy production in gross final energy
consumption to 49 percent by 2020 from 39.8 percent in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
