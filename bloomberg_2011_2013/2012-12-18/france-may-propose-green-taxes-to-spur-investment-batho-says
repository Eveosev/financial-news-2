France  will study new environmental
taxes to try to change habits and fund green energy investment,
Environment and Energy Minister Delphine Batho said.  A first series of measures may be proposed before June, she
said in a speech in Paris today as a commission set up to
examine potential policies met for the first time.  The Socialist government wants to cut reliance on nuclear
power and promote energy efficiency. Former President Nicolas
Sarkozy was forced to scrap a tax on carbon emissions in 2010.  “We must learn lessons from past failures,” Batho said.  France collected 40 billion euros ($53 billion) in 2011
from environmental taxes, three-quarters of which were on energy
used, mostly from fossil fuels, according to a ministry document
released today. The taxes may be a way to pay for a planned
shift in energy sources, as well as helping to cut pollution and
conserve resources, Batho told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
