Saudi Arabian Mining Co., (MAADEN)  the Saudi
Arabian company that’s building an alumina refinery in a joint
venture with  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , obtained $2.4 billion in loans to
finance projects, raising more money than initially sought.  The company, known as Maaden, raised 9 billion riyals from
five-year Islamic loan after seeking 7 billion riyals, the
Riyadh-based miner said in a  statement  on the Saudi stock
exchange today. The deal was oversubscribed 2.5 times, it said.  The miner of gold, phosphate and other materials is raising
cash to expand in Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil
exporter. Earlier this month, Maaden awarded contracts valued at
977 million riyals to  Fluor Corp. (FLR)  and Bechtel Corp. to develop
phosphate industries in the kingdom.  Maaden raised the loan from National Commercial Bank,  Samba
Financial Group (SAMBA) ,  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR) ,  Riyad Bank (RIBL) ,  Saudi British
Bank (SABB) ,  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) ,  Bank Al Jazira (BJAZ) ,  Arab National Bank (ARNB) ,  Bank
Albilad (ALBI) ,  Saudi Investment Bank (SIBC)  and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Maaden shares  have gained 30 percent this year compared
with a 7.1 percent increase for the benchmark Tadawul All Share
Index. Three analysts have a buy recommendation on the stock,
two rate it hold and three say sell, according to  data compiled 
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
