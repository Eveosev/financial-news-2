Malaysian Airline System Bhd. (MAS) , the
nation’s largest long-haul carrier, agreed to buy 36 turboprop
planes worth 3 billion ringgit ($982 million) from Avions De
Transport Regional to tap rising travel demand in the region.  Malaysian Air is purchasing the ATR 72-600 planes for its
Firefly and MASwings units that operate short-haul flights, the
Subang Jaya, Malaysia-based carrier said in a stock exchange
filing today. Deliveries of the aircraft are expected to start
from the second quarter of next year, the company said.  Firefly, which began operations in 2007, will add 20 of the
new planes while the rest will be used by MASwings, according to
the statement. Malaysian Air is adding new planes and paring
unprofitable routes as it seeks to cut costs and lure more
travelers amid competition from budget carrier  AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA)   Malaysian Air last month said it plans to raise as much as
3.1 billion ringgit from a rights issue after posting its first
profit in seven quarters. Part of the funds will be used to make
pre-delivery payments to  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS.  Firefly is expected to “rapidly grow” in the next five
years, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, Malaysian Air’s group chief
executive officer, said in the statement. The unit currently
operates a fleet of 12 ATR 72-500 planes out of Penang and
Subang to destinations including Indonesia and  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
