(Corrects Hirscher’s nationality in headline. The original
story was published yesterday.)  Marcel Hirscher  won the night slalom
at Madonna di Campiglio in  Italy , where a course official died
of an apparent heart attack.  The Austrian skier moved into second place in the overall
World Cup ski standings, in which he is the defending champion.  An official assigned to make sure racers go around each
gate correctly died of apparent cardiac arrest during the first
run, the  Associated Press  reported, citing race organizers.  Hirscher completed the two runs on the Canalone Miramonti
course in a combined 1 minute, 42.5 seconds, beating runner-up
Felix Neureuther of  Germany  by 1.67 seconds.  Japan ’s Naoki Yuasa
was third at 1:44.78, followed by  Sweden ’s Andre Myhrer at
1:44.84.  American Ted Ligety, who has four giant slalom wins this
year, was ninth at 1:45.54. He’s now 10th in the slalom
standings and third overall with 537 points, trailing  Norway ’s
Aksel Lund Svindal (614 points) and Hirscher (560).  The 23-year-old Hirscher moved to the top of the slalom
standings with 240 points, 40 points ahead of Myhrer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
