Enbridge Inc. has delayed a shutdown
of its oil pipeline 6B to March from February to allow the
company to tie in new sections of pipe.  The line, which runs from Griffith,  Indiana , to Sarnia,
Ontario, will be shut for 72 hours, according to  Graham White , a
Calgary-based company spokesman. The closing was delayed “to
ensure that all the sections are ready for service,” White said
in an e-mail.  Line 6B has a capacity of 283,000 barrels a day. A January
notice on the company’s website said it was operating under a
pressure restriction limiting capacity to 231,400 barrels daily.
White didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail asking if the
pressure restrictions remain in place.  Nominations to ship oil on Line 6B were apportioned 14
percent for December deliveries, Enbridge said in an e-mailed
statement Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
