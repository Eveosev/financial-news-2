Steel reinforcement-bar gained for a
third day, rising to the highest level in five months, amid
signs lending in China will increase next year, stimulating
economic growth.  Rebar for delivery in May rose as much as 0.8 percent to
3,841  yuan  ($616) per metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange, the highest price for the most-active contract since
July 19. Futures ended the morning session at 3,824 a ton,
trimming this year’s decline to 9.2 percent.  China’s new loans may be about 9 trillion yuan next year, a
gain of as much as 800 billion yuan from this year, the Shanghai
Securities News reported. Chinese  stocks  climbed to the highest
level in five months after Shen Danyang, Commerce Ministry
spokesman, said in Beijing the economy may rebound in 2013.  “The rally in rebar will likely continue” as the
government will continue to spend money on infrastructure, Zhang
Xin, an analyst at Yongan Futures (Shenyang) Co., said by phone.  China  will seek higher-quality growth next year, with
urbanization a driver, the Xinhua News Agency reported Dec. 16,
citing the central economic work conference in Beijing. The
country will boost spending on so-called non-redundant
infrastructure projects that provide long-term benefits, it said.  The  average spot price  of rebar rose 0.6 percent to 3,604
yuan a ton yesterday, the highest since Nov. 28, according to
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Spot iron ore  gained
2.2 percent to $132.20 a dry ton at Tianjin port yesterday,
according to a gauge compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
