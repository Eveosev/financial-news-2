SkyCity Entertainment Group Ltd. (SKC) ,
 New Zealand ’s largest casino operator, rose the most in nine
months after agreeing regulatory concessions at its South
Australia site that will lead to a major redevelopment.  The state government will extend Adelaide Casino’s
exclusivity for table games and premium gaming for 20 years to
2035, Auckland-based SkyCity said in a statement. The deal,
subject to regulatory approval, allows the company to spend more
than $A300 million ($316 million) at the site, it said. The
shares rose 3.6 percent, heading for the biggest move since
March 15.  SkyCity wants to boost revenues in Adelaide after saying in
August that second-half profits were curbed by falling revenues
from its South Australian unit amid soft demand and exchange-
rate effects. The company plans to build a 6-star hotel,
restaurants and new carpark facilities, it said.  The new agreement “levels the playing field with our
regional competitors,” Chief Executive Officer Nigel Morrison
said in the statement.  Under the agreement, SkyCity will add more gaming machines
and tables, and will also pay more tax on gaming earnings. The
 tax rate  on machines will rise to as much as 41 percent from
34.4 percent, it said.  SkyCity shares rose 13 cents to NZ$3.75 at 12:50 p.m. in
Wellington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
