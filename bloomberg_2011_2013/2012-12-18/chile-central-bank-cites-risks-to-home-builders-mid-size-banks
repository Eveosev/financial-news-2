Chile ’s central bank cautioned today
that the rapid growth of home builders and medium-size banks
expose the two industries to “vulnerabilities.”  Home builders have taken on more debt, while mortgage
lending for their clients has become less restrictive, the
central bank said in its bi-annual financial stability report
today. Those two factors create financial vulnerabilities for
real-estate and construction companies as well as households.  Medium-size banks are growing faster than their larger
counterparts and may become increasingly exposed to the threat
of cyclical factors, especially as lenders run the risk of
underestimating the threats posed by credit card debt, the
central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
