The upward revision of the outlook
on the U.K.’s largest publicly traded water company reflects
credit metrics that show “an increasing degree of headroom
supported by financial outperformance in the 2010-2015
regulatory period to date,” Standard & Poor’s said.  The London-based ratings service that revised  United
Utilities Group Plc (UU/) ’s outlook to positive from stable said
regulatory measures of operational performance are steadily
improving with the company remaining “committed to its almost
exclusive focus on the low-risk, regulated water sector.”  Revising the outlook on Warrington, England-based United
Utilities and the water and waste service provider’s operating
company to positive “reflects the possibility that we could
upgrade the companies in the current regulatory period if the
current trends continue,” it said in a statement.  United Utilities shares have risen 16 percent this year
compared with a 5.3 percent gain by the five-member Bloomberg
Europe Water Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
