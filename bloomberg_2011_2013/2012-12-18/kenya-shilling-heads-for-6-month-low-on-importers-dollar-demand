Kenya ’s shilling swung between gains
and losses as the central bank stepped up efforts to support the
currency amid increased demand for dollars from retailers to buy
imports for the festive season.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy traded less
than 0.1 percent weaker at 86.11 per dollar by 2:13 p.m., in
Nairobi, the capital, poised for the lowest since May 31. The
shilling earlier appreciated as much as 0.4 percent.  The Central Bank of Kenya offered 8 billion shillings ($93
million) in today’s sale of seven-day  repurchase agreements 
compared with 2.7 billion shillings accepted yesterday, a bank
official who asked not to be identified in line with policy,
said by phone. Imports in Kenya rise during the Christmas and
year-end period as companies anticipate higher sales. Christians
account for 87 percent of Kenya’s 38 million population,
according to the CIA World Factbook.  “The Kenyan shilling slipped as importers stocked up on
dollars before the holidays,” Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd. said
in an e-mailed note to clients. “We expect the shilling to be
lifted in coming days by dollar inflows from Kenyans working
abroad and holidaymakers flocking to the country’s game reserves
in December. The shilling has been supported by the central
bank’s efforts to support it by mopping up extra supply.”  The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.1 percent to 2,657.49 a
dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling gained 0.1 percent to 1,598 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
