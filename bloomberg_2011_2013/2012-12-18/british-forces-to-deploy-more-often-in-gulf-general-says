British joint-forces units will
spend longer periods of time deployed in the Gulf, said General
Sir David Richards, chief of the U.K. defense staff.  “We would expect, with other initiatives, for Joint
Expeditionary Force elements to spend more time reassuring and
deterring” to assist Britain’s friends in the Middle East and
Gulf, the general said in a speech to the Royal United Services
Institute in  London  yesterday, which was posted on the
organization’s  website .  The U.K. has some units already based in the Gulf,
including naval vessels and a command unit in Bahrain, as well
as aircraft in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.  The British army will create two or more brigades to form
close relationships with the Gulf states and  Jordan  to ensure
better military cooperation, the general said. “Should the need
arise for another Libya-style operation, we will be prepared.”  The general also referred to “traditional but potentially
enhanced roles” for U.K. forces in Oman, Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia as he set out the role of British forces after the end of
combat operations in  Afghanistan  in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
