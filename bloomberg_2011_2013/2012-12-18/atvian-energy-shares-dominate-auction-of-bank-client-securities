Shares of two Latvian energy
companies raised the most money in an auction of securities from
client accounts at the bankrupt Latvijas Krajbanka AS on the
Nasdaq OMX Riga stock exchange.  Investors bought shares, bonds and fund holdings for
553,814 lats ($1.05 million) in the auction today, according to
 results  on the exchange’s website. Almost half the amount was
for shares of natural-gas utility  Latvijas Gaze (GZE1R)  and oil terminal
operator  AS Ventspils Nafta (VNF1R) , sold at or near today’s closing
prices on the bourse in Riga.  Shares of distillery  AS Latvijas Balzams (BAL1R)  sold at an average
price per share of 1.28 lats, 32 percent less than today’s
closing price on the exchange. A single investor paid 12 percent
more than today’s close for the 33,570 shares of steelmaker  AS
Liepajas Metalurgs (LME1R)  on offer.  Proceeds from the sale of 35 different securities will be
held by notaries for the account owners, who failed to claim
them from the defunct lender before a Nov. 30 deadline,
according to the exchange.  Latvia took over Krajbanka in November 2011 after
Lithuanian regulators seized its parent, Bankas Snoras AB, on
claims assets had disappeared. KPMG Baltics, Krajbanka’s
bankruptcy administrator, is also seeking to sell real estate
belonging to the bank in 14 auctions  detailed  on the lender’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
