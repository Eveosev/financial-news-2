World soybean production will be
smaller than expected this season as rain delays sowing in
 Argentina , while  Europe ’s rapeseed crop is expected to rise in
2013 as planting climbs in  Germany , researcher Oil World said.  Farmers will harvest 269.1 million metric tons of soybeans
in 2012-13, up from 239.9 million tons in the previous year, the
Hamburg-based researcher wrote in an e-mailed report. The
outlook was cut from 269.5 million tons a month ago.  Rapeseed futures in Paris gained 5.8 percent this year,
while soybeans jumped 22 percent after the worst U.S. drought in
more than 50 years curbed yields and as excessive rain in
Argentina creates concerns about the crop there.  “Argentina weather disturbances and planting delays
continue to be major uncertainties for the soybean market,” Oil
World wrote. “Later plantings will result in lower yields. The
next two to four weeks will be crucial.”  The outlook for Argentina’s harvest was cut by 1 million
tons from a month ago to 53 million tons, still up from 40.1
million tons in 2012, while “it cannot be excluded” that the
crop will turn out about 50 million tons, Oil World said.  Canada’s soybean crop may rise to 4.93 million tons in
2013, compared with a November forecast for 4.28 million tons,
and from estimated production of 4.3 million tons this year.  The European Union’s rapeseed area is expected to climb to
6.51 million hectares (16.1 million acres) from 6.15 million
hectares in 2012, the company wrote. That might increase the
bloc’s harvest of the oilseed to 20.5 million tons from 19.1
million tons this year, Oil World said.  German farmers are expected to harvest 1.44 million
hectares of rapeseed, from 1.31 million hectares this year,
while  France ’s area may slip to 1.52 million hectares from 1.61
million hectares, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
