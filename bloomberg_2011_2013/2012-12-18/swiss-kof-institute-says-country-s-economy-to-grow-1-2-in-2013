Switzerland ’s  economic growth  will
grow 1.2 percent next year as both domestic demand and exports
advance, the KOF Economic Institute said.  Swiss gross domestic product will probably rise 1 percent
this year before advancing 1.2 percent in 2013 and 2 percent in
2014, the Zurich-based institute said in an e-mailed statement
today, citing a survey of economists. In September, KOF had
forecast the economy to expand 0.9 percent this year and 1.3
percent next year.  Switzerland’s economy returned to growth in the third
quarter, even as the euro area, its biggest export market, fell
into its second recession in four years. The  Swiss National Bank 
last week renewed its commitment to a ceiling of 1.20 francs per
euro, saying the strong franc continues to weigh on the economy.
The SNB sees Swiss GDP advancing between 1 percent and 1.5
percent next year, while the government on Dec. 13 trimmed its
growth forecast to 1.3 percent from a previous prediction of 1.4
percent.  “Despite the introduction of the minimum  exchange rate ,
many observers assumed that the effects of the still overvalued
franc would manifest in falling exports and rising
unemployment,” KOF said in its statement. “This trend has
generally failed to materialize.”  KOF raised its forecast for 2012 Swiss export growth to 0.4
percent from 0.1 percent previously and lowered its 2013
estimate to 2.3 percent from 2.7 percent. In 2014, foreign sales
will expand 4.9 percent, KOF said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
