Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Statoil
ASA didn’t find a seller for North Sea Forties crude for a
second day. Trafigura Beheer BV failed to offload a cargo of
Ekofisk blend.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, is scheduled to
export 65 crude shipments in February, according to a partial
loading program that excluded one grade. This is almost equal to
the full January export plan.  North Sea  Shell bid at a premium of 80 cents to Dated Brent for a
Jan. 8 to Jan. 10 loading consignment, the same level as
yesterday, according to a survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. Statoil sought to buy at
the same price for Jan. 8 to Jan. 11 cargo, 15 cents more than
its bid yesterday, the survey showed.  Trafigura offered Ekofisk consignment C11324 for loading on
Jan. 4 to Jan. 6 at a $1.95 premium to Dated Brent, according to
the survey. The cargo has been advanced by two days, two people
with knowledge of the matter said.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days rose 1 cent to 74 cents more
than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for February settlement traded at $108.75 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $108.07 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $107.87, a discount of 88 cents to February.  Two January Ekofisk cargoes were deferred to load in
February, the people said, declining to be identified because
the information is confidential. Consignment C11327 will now
load on Feb. 1 and lot C11330 on Feb. 4, they said.  Exports of Troll crude in January will increase to 14
cargoes, one more than this month, a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News showed.  The plan comprises 10 lots of 600,000 barrels, three of
300,000 barrels and one of 1 million barrels. This compares with
12 consignments of 600,000 barrels each and one shipment of 1
million barrels in December.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Urals crude, according to
the Platts survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened 2 cents to minus 28 cents, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In northwest  Europe , the  discount  to Dated Brent was
unchanged at $1, the data showed.  West Africa  Daily exports from Nigeria in February are scheduled to be
2.12 million barrels, according to the plan. Total shipments for
next month are planned at 2.16 million, the full program for
January showed.  The country plans to ship 12 consignments of its benchmark
Qua Iboe grade in February, one more than a revised schedule for
next month, the program showed. Exports of Bonny Light blend
will also increase by one lot to seven cargoes.  The African nation will export eight cargoes of Forcados,
six of Agbami, five each of Bonga and Brass River, four lots of
Usan, three each of Akpo, Erha and Escravos, two each of Antan,
Okono and Yoho and one consignment each of Abo, EA Blend and
Okwori, the plans showed. No shipment of Pennington was planned
for February.  Equatorial Guinea is set to increase exports of Zafiro
crude in February while Gabon is scheduled to ship two lots of
its Rabi Light grade, according to two loading programs.  Three 950,000 barrel consignments of Zafiro are to be
shipped in February, two more than next month, the plan showed.
Exports of Gabon’s Rabi Light are set to be two lots of 650,000
barrels, unchanged from January, a second schedule showed.  Ghana will ship three cargoes of 950,000 barrels each of
Jubilee crude in February, unchanged from January, according to
a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  CPC Corp., a Taiwan state-run oil company, issued a tender
to buy low-sulfur crude for delivery in March, according to a
document obtained by Bloomberg News.  The tender closes tomorrow at 10 a.m. local time, with
offers valid until 7 p.m. on Dec. 21, the document showed.  Qua Iboe blend gained 4 cents to at $2.67 a barrel more
