Regent Pacific Group Ltd. (575) , the
 investment company  that made an unsuccessful bid for BC Iron
Ltd. last year, said it may sell its 20 percent  stake  in the
Australian iron ore producer to buy stakes in other miners.  Regent Pacific sought shareholder approval for a potential
stake sale worth A$82 million ($86 million) at yesterday’s
close, according to a statement late yesterday from the Hong
Kong-based company. Jamie Gibson, Regent Pacific’s chief
executive officer, resigned as a non-executive director of  BC
Iron Ltd. (BCI) , the Perth-based company said today in a statement.  “I would like to acknowledge the considerable support
Regent Pacific has provided to BC Iron over the years having
taking its initial holding in the company some years ago,”
Chairman Tony Kiernan said in the statement.  Regent Pacific, which has a market value HK$694 million
($90 million), in January 2011  offered  A$267 million, A$3.30 a
share, for the stock in BC Iron it didn’t own. The bid failed
after biggest shareholder Consolidated Minerals Ltd., led by
Ukrainian billionaire Gennadiy Bogolyubov, opposed the proposal.  Separately, BC Iron said today it will sell new shares at
A$3.04 apiece to help fund the purchase of an additional stake
in the Nullagine Iron Ore Joint Venture from  Fortescue Metals
Group Ltd. (FMG)  that was announced earlier this month.  BC Iron slipped 1.5 percent to A$3.37 at 10:20 a.m. in
Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
