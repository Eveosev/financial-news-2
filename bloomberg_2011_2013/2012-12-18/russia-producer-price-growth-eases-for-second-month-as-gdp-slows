Russian producer-price growth
decelerated for a second month in November as oil-products costs
eased and an economic slowdown continued.  Producer prices  rose 6.7 percent from a year earlier, the
Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in an e-mailed
statement. That’s less than the 7.5 percent median estimate of
eight economists in a Bloomberg survey. Prices fell 1.2 percent
from the previous month.  Analysts are downgrading their growth projections for the
world’s biggest energy exporter as economic expansion slows to
the weakest since a recovery began at the start of 2010.
 Europe ’s debt crisis is weakening demand for Russian commodities
and the Economy Ministry has cut this year’s forecast for
 industrial-output  growth to 3.2 percent from 3.6 percent.  “Economic growth has slowed and many producers are already
having to cut prices to maintain demand,” Olga Sterina, an
analyst at Moscow-based Uralsib Capital, said today by phone.
The producer-price dynamics “reflect current economic trends.”  Prices in mining advanced 13.8 percent from a year earlier
in November, while they rose 7.4 percent in utilities and 3.9
percent in manufacturing, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
