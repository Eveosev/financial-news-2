The U.S. increased import duties on
wind towers produced by Chengxi Shipyard Co. and CS Wind Corp.
from preliminary levies imposed earlier this year in an attempt
to prevent the goods made in China and  Vietnam  from undercutting
the domestic industry.  The final rate for CS Wind, to offset government subsidies,
is 21.86 percent. Rates to prevent the goods from being sold in
the U.S. below cost are 47.59 percent for Chengxi and 44.99
percent for Titan Wind Energy Suzhou Co., the Commerce
Department said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
