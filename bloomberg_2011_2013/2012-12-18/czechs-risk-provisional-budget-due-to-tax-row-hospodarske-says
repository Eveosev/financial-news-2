The Czech government may be forced
to start the year with a provisional budget if President Vaclav
Klaus rejects a bill that includes tax increases,  Hospodarske
Noviny  reported, citing a government lawmaker.  If Klaus returns the legislation to lawmakers later than
Dec. 21, the chamber wonâ€™t be able to reconvene and overturn his
veto, Hospodarske said, citing Pavel Suchanek, the head of the
parliamentary budget committee. The lower house of parliament is
expected to vote tomorrow on the bill, needed to cut the  budget
deficit  next year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
