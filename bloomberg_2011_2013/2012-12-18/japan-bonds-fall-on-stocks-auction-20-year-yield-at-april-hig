Japan ’s bonds declined, sending 20-
year yields to an eight-month high, as demand ebbed at a sale of
the securities and domestic shares climbed.  The sale of 1.2 trillion yen ($14.3 billion) of 20-year
bonds had the lowest demand in four months. Yields on the
benchmark 10-year note rose to a one-month high as Japan’s
Nikkei 225 Stock Average reached the most since April amid signs
U.S. budget talks are progressing.  “Investors are cautious in the midst of the rising
yields,” said Naomi Muguruma, a Tokyo-based senior fixed-income
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., one
of the 25 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt
sales. “The auction results prompted selling, weighing on the
market.”  The 20-year rate climbed as much as three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.74 percent, the most since April 9,
according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker. The yield was at 1.725 percent as of
3:45 p.m. in  Tokyo . The 30-year rate reached 1.99 percent, the
most since April 4, before trading at 1.98 percent.  The benchmark 10-year rate climbed as much as 2 1/2 basis
points to 0.76 percent, the highest level since Nov. 15, before
paring to 0.755 percent.  The 20-year bonds sold today attracted bids valued at 3.11
times the amount on offer compared with a so-called bid-to-cover
ratio of 3.67 in November. It was the least since the 2.38 level
seen at the auction in August.  Demand for the safety of  government bonds  was damped after
U.S. President  Barack Obama  was said to make concessions in
negotiations to break the budget impasse.  Obama made a new budget offer that would raise taxes by
$1.2 trillion and lift tax rates for households earning more
than $400,000 a year, up from a previous threshold of $250,000,
said a person familiar with the talks. The president and House
Speaker  John Boehner  are negotiating to avert more than $600
billion in tax increases and spending cuts set to start in
January, known as the fiscal cliff.  To contact the reporters on this story:
