Iberdrola SA (IBE) , the world’s largest
wind-farm operator, is seeking U.K. permission to build a 1,200-
megawatt project off eastern  England  with Vattenfall AB.  The  East Anglia One  project would be the first phase in a
wind complex that could generate as much as 7,200 megawatts,
Iberdrola said today in an e-mailed statement. The 325 turbines
of the initial wind park would supply power to about 770,000
homes, the company said.  The U.K. has installed more offshore wind-power capacity
than any other country, and more than half of the European
total. The government, seeking to boost clean-energy output as
aging power plants are retired, pays subsidies for  wind energy 
at sea as it targets a sixfold increase in capacity to 18,000
megawatts of turbines by 2020.  The East Anglia One farm would create 2,700 jobs during
construction, according to Bilbao, Spain-based Iberdrola. If
approved, the project will be the company’s “most ambitious”
venture, with building work starting in 2016 and first power
generation due in 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
