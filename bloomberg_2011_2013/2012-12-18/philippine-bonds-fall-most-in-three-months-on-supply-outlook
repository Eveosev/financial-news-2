Philippine 19-year sovereign bonds
fell by the most in three months after the government said it
may increase the size of debt auctions in the first quarter. The
peso weakened.  There’s a plan to boost sales to take advantage of surplus
cash in the banking system, Treasurer Rosalie de Leon told
reporters in  Manila  yesterday after data showed money sent home
by Filipinos working overseas climbed to a record. The nation’s
local-currency notes returned 9 percent this year, the third-
best performance among 10 Asian fixed-income indexes compiled by
HSBC Holdings Plc.  “There’s uncertainty with regards to the supply of bonds
next quarter,” said Jan Briace Santos, a debt trader who helps
manage the equivalent of $17 billion at BPI Asset Management Inc.
in Manila. “This is a short-term correction. Fundamentally,
we’re still sound.”  The yield on the government’s 8 percent notes due July 2031
rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.6 percent
as of 4:14 p.m. in Manila, according to prices from Tradition
Financial Services. That was the biggest increase since Sept. 17
and the highest level in three weeks. The yield has dropped 57
basis points this year.  Remittances increased 8.5 percent to $1.93 billion in
October from a year earlier, beating the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey for a rise to $1.89 billion.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 41.075 per dollar, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached 40.840 on Nov. 29,
the strongest level since March 2008. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, fell 20 basis points to 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
