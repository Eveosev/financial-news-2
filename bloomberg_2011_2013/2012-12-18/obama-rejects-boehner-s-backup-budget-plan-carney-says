President  Barack Obama  is rejecting
an alternative budget plan proposed by House Speaker John Boehner, White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.  Boehner’s plan “can’t pass the Senate and therefore will
not protect middle class families, and does little to address
our fiscal challenges with zero spending cuts.”  The “parameters of a deal are clear,” Carney said, and
Obama is willing to continue working with Boehner to avoid the
automatic tax increases and spending cuts due to start next
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
