China’s rare-earth stocks surged in
 Shanghai  trading after Hunan Corun New Energy Co.’s plan to
acquire Yiyang Hongyuan Rare  Earth Co. (8922)  fueled expectations of
industry consolidation and improved profits.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111) , China’s
biggest producer, surged as much as 7.5 percent to 37  yuan , the
highest intraday level since Aug. 24.  Rising Nonferrous Metals
Share Co. (600259)  surged 10 percent, the daily limit, to 47.55 yuan.  Hunan Corun New Energy, a maker of batteries for hybrid
cars, plans to buy Yiyang Hongyuan Rare Earth Co., with an
estimated value of 1.22 billion yuan ($196 million), from
controller Cao Youmin through share placements, according to an
 exchange filing  today. China, supplier of 90 percent of the
world’s rare earths, is encouraging value-added production
rather than the exports of the minerals to help conserve
resources and protect the environment.  “The planned purchase revives expectations of
consolidation through the industry chain,” said Zhang Fang, a
Beijing-based analyst with China Securities Co. “The market is
bullish on rare earth stocks.”  Rare earths are a group of 17 chemically similar elements
used in helicopter blades, wind turbines and hybrid cars.  Japan Supply  Hunan Corun (600478)  will supply a nickel-hydride battery plant in
Kanagawa Prefecture, south of  Tokyo , with rare earths mined by
Yiyang Hongyuan, the statement said. Hunan Corun bought the
plant in 2011 from Panasonic Corp., it said.  “Our  Japan  factory has been weaker than our competitors’
in terms of production costs,” Hunan Corun said. “Rare earths
are an important material for nickel-hydride batteries. There’s
been a supply shortage in Japan in recent years.”  China’s export controls on rare earths have soured ties
with the world’s major users, including the U.S. and Japan. The
World Trade Organization agreed in July to probe China’s export
limits and tariffs on the metals amid complaints that the curbs
break global commerce rules.  Hunan Corun plans to issue about 48 million shares to Cao
for his 80 percent interest in Yiyang Hongyuan, according to the
statement. It would also sell shares to as many as 10 investors
to raise no more than 325 million yuan. Of that, 244 million
yuan would be used to buy the remaining 20 percent of the target
company from Cao, it said.  Hunan Corun surged by 10 percent, the daily limit, to 20.5
yuan in Shanghai, taking its gain to 29 percent in the past 12
months. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.7 percent.
 Xiamen Tungsten Co. (600549) , which also has rare-earth assets, advanced
2.7 percent to 36.81 yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
