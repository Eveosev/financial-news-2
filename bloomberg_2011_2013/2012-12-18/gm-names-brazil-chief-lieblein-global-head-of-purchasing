General Motors Co. (GM)  named Grace
Lieblein, head of the automaker’s Brazil operations, as its new
global purchasing and supply chain vice president.  Lieblein, 52, succeeds Bob Socia, who became the head of
GM’s China operations on Oct. 1, replacing  Kevin Wale , who
retired in September, GM said today in a statement.  Her appointment, which is effective immediately, comes as
Chief Executive Dan Akerson is working to prepare a
reorganization of the company around global functions and
brands, two people familiar with the thinking have said.  Lieblein joined GM in 1978 and has held several leadership
positions in engineering, product development and manufacturing,
the company said. She became president of GM’s Brazil operations
in April 2011 and was previously head of the automaker’s Mexico
business. In her new role, she reports to Stephen Girsky, vice
chairman.  Jaime Ardila, president of GM South America, will
temporarily take on the duties of running  Brazil , GM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
