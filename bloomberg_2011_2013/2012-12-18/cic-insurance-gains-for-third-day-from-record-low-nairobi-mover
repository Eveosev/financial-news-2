CIC Insurance Group Ltd. (CIC) , Kenya’s
second-biggest insurer by premiums, rose for a third day, the
longest set of gains in seven weeks, as the stock recovered from
a record low.  The shares advanced 1.5 percent to close at 3.35 shillings
in Nairobi, the capital. The stock traded at 3.10 shillings on
Dec. 5, its lowest level since July 18 when it was listed on the
Nairobi Securities Exchange at a price of 3.5 shillings.  “There was a decline and now the stock is going through a
correction to get back some of the value it lost,” Eric Munywoki, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Old Mutual
Securities Ltd., said by phone today. “Looking at the price to
earnings ratio, the stock is overpriced compared to its peers,
therefore the gains will be temporary.”  Jubilee Holdings Ltd. (JBIC) , Kenya’s biggest insurer, has a
price to earnings ratio of 5.67, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Pan Africa Insurance Holdings Ltd. (PAIL)  has a ratio of
8.71, while  CFC Insurance Holdings Ltd. (CFCI) ’s is 3.67, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  CIC has a ratio of 12.8, based on earnings in the 12 months
to December 2011, Munywoki said.  The company’s first-half profit fell 12 percent to 415.1
million shillings ($4.82 million) after costs and claims
increased, it said in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
