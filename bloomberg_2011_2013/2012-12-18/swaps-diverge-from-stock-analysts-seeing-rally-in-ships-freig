At a time when equity analysts are
predicting the biggest rebound in earnings for Capesize iron-ore
carriers in six years, swaps traders are betting that rates in
2013 will be the second-lowest on record.  Capesize earnings will rise 58 percent to $12,250 a day
next year, the median of nine analyst predictions compiled by
Bloomberg shows. Shares of  STX Pan Ocean (028670)  Co., with the highest
proportion of Capesizes among the five largest owners, will gain
18 percent in a year, based on the average of 15 estimates.
Forward freight agreements, used to bet on future rates,
anticipate $8,914, or 15 percent above this year’s record-low
average of $7,739, according to shipbroker Clarkson Plc.  Rates plunged 74 percent in 2012 as ship owners contended
with a glut caused by the biggest fleet expansion in history.
Equity analysts are more bullish for 2013 amid London-based
Clarkson’s prediction that capacity gains will exceed demand
growth by the least in a decade. Swaps slumped 13 percent in the
past month as traders reacted to a spot-rate index that fell
because of concern that China, the biggest iron-ore buyer, is
slowing and as Europe and  Japan  tumbled back into recessions.  “You’ve got the immediate pressure of an index that’s
losing a thousand dollars a day every day, and that has an
impact on the overall thinking” for 2013, said Philippe Van Den Abeele, the London-based managing director of Castalia Fund
Management (U.K.) Ltd., an adviser to a hedge fund trading
swaps. “The lowest year will be 2012. The extent to which it
has capability of rising, that’s the question.”  Break Even  Earnings for single-voyage charters fell in 18 of the past
19 sessions, plunging 63 percent to $6,239 by Dec. 14, according
to the Baltic Exchange, the London-based publisher of freight
costs on 61 routes. The rates anticipated by both equity
analysts and swaps traders would still be below the at least
$15,500 that Pareto Securities AS, an Oslo-based investment
bank, says Capesize owners need to break even.  Fleet capacity will expand 4.8 percent next year while
demand advances 4.1 percent, the smallest difference since 2003,
Clarkson data show.  China , which buys 65 percent of all seaborne
iron-ore cargoes, will import a record 778.2 million metric tons
next year, from 728.3 million tons in 2012, according to the
median of 10 analyst estimates. The extra volume is equal to 312
voyages for the Capesize fleet of 1,482 ships.  Steel Association  Iron-ore prices at the Chinese port of Tianjin advanced 52
percent to $132.20 a ton since Sept. 5 as economic growth
accelerated after slowing for seven quarters. The country
imported 65.78 million tons last month, the most since a record
amount was bought in January 2011, customs data show. Its steel
output reached 59.1 million tons in October, the most in three
months, the Brussels-based World Steel Association estimates.  While economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect China to
accelerate in the next two quarters, economies are contracting
in the 17-nation euro area and Japan, which account for 16
percent of global steel output. The  Congressional Budget Office 
says the U.S., the third-largest steelmaker, risks going into
recession should policy makers fail to avert automatic spending
cuts and tax rises scheduled to start next month.  Vale SA (VALE) , the largest iron-ore supplier, will cut production
by 1.9 percent to 306 million tons in 2013, amid signs that
demand growth is slowing, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said
in a statement Dec. 3. Shipments from  Brazil  to China generate
the most demand for Capesizes, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
A voyage from  Australia , the biggest exporter, to China takes
about 13 days, compared with 38 days from Brazil.  Biggest Exporter  The glut in Capesizes extends to most of the rest of the
merchant fleet. The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a measure of oil
transportation costs, averaged the lowest on record this year,
according to the  Baltic Exchange . A gauge reflecting charges for
six types of containers slid 12 percent since the start of
January, data from the Hamburg Shipbrokers’ Association show.  Owners may diminish the glut of ore carriers by slowing
down or demolishing ships. A record amount of Capesize capacity
will be scrapped this year, Clarkson estimates. Speeds averaged
9.4 knots last month, compared with 10.3 two years ago, ship-
tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. That also boosts
profit by cutting fuel costs, owners’ single biggest expense.  Shares of Seoul-based STX Pan Ocean fell 33 percent to
4,075 won this year and will reach 4,820.12 won in 12 months,
the estimates show. Just five out of the 25 analysts covering
the company recommend selling the stock.  Nippon Yusen (9101)  K.K., the
largest Capesize owner, will report net income of $52.7 million
in its fiscal year ending March 31, from a loss of $922.9
million a year earlier, according to the average of 16 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Selling Stock  Traders handled $8.6 billion of swaps in dry-bulk freight
in the year to Nov. 1, Baltic Exchange data show. The contracts
correctly predicted the direction of rates about 60 percent of
the time in the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ore inventories at Chinese ports fell 22 percent to 73.7
million tons since Sept. 1, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. That signals steelmakers may need to
restock. Domestic steel consumption will rise 4.1 percent to 666
million tons next year, the China Metallurgical Industry
Planning and Research Institute estimates.  Expanding demand for ore comes as the flood of additional
shipping capacity eases. While outstanding orders at shipyards
are still equal to 18 percent of the existing fleet, that
compares with 100 percent in December 2008, according to data
from IHS Inc., an Englewood, Colorado-based research company.
Owners made the orders as rates rose as high as $233,988.  “It really isn’t about supply anymore, it’s about how long
before demand catches up,” said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an Oslo-
based analyst at Arctic Securities ASA whose recommendations on
the shares of shipping companies returned 17 percent in the past
year. Forward freight agreements “for Capes are too low,
compared to the analyst views. Swap traders may be playing more
the short-term view.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
