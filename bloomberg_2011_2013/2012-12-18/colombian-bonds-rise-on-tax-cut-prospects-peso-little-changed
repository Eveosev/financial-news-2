Colombia’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields down the most in a week, as the Lower House approved a
proposal to cut taxes on foreigners’ bond profits to 14 percent.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
securities due in July 2024 fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.89 percent, the biggest drop since Dec.
6, according to the central bank. The price increased 0.465
centavo to 133.758 centavos per peso.  The Senate hasn’t yet voted on the proposal that the Lower
House approved yesterday to cut the tax on foreigners’ bond
profits from the current 33 percent. Investors from countries
considered tax havens would be taxed at 25 percent, which
Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas favors for all foreigners.  “There is much more gains in betting on the 14 percent
than the 25 percent, and so investors prefer to go long on the
bonds until we get the final decision,” said Felipe Campos, the
head analyst at Alianza Valores brokerage in Bogota. Yields on
peso bonds will probably rise if the 14 percent rate is
rejected, he said. A long is a bet an asset will gain value.  The central bank will leave the overnight lending rate at
4.50 percent at this year’s last monetary policy meeting on Dec.
21, according to 29 of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Two
analysts expect a 25 basis point cut to 4.25 percent.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 1,793.75 per U.S. dollar at
the close in Bogota and has rallied 8.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
