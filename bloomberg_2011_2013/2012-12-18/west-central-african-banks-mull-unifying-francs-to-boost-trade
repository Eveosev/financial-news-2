The central banks of West and
Central Africa are considering combining their currencies,
according to Lucas Abaga Nchama, governor of the Bank of Central
African States.  The West African and Central African CFA francs are
currently separate currencies that are both pegged to the euro.
Merging them would boost trade and help fight  money laundering ,
Nchama said in comments broadcast on Radio Malabo, the state
broadcaster for Equatorial Guinea.  The franc zone covers 14 African countries, Benin,  Burkina
Faso , Cameroon,  Central African Republic , Chad, Congo Republic,
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali,
Niger, Senegal and Togo.  Six other West African nations -- Nigeria, Ghana,  Sierra
Leone , Gambia, Guinea and Liberia -- plan to enact a common
currency, known as the Eco, by January 2015, 12 years behind an
initial target, Temitope Oshikoya, chief executive officer of
the West African Monetary Institute, said in an interview in
November last year.  The Eco target was pushed back as countries continued to
fail to meet standards including single-digit inflation, a
budget deficit of not more than 4 percent of gross domestic
product excluding grants, and central bank reserves of not less
than three months of import cover, according to Oshikoya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
