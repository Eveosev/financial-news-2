The Philippine government estimates
the economic impact of storm Bopha at 32 billion pesos ($780
million) or about 0.3 percent of the nation’s gross domestic
product, Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said.  The amount includes production losses, foregone revenues
and damage to infrastructure and crops, Balisacan said in a
briefing in  Manila  today. The storm’s impact will be minimal in
the fourth quarter, with its effect felt in 2013, he said.  Storm Bopha struck the  Philippines  earlier this month,
killing more than 1,000 people after rains caused landslides and
floods. The government may spend 10 billion pesos on
reconstruction in the affected areas, Budget Secretary Butch
Abad said yesterday.  The  economy  may expand 6.5 percent this year, with third-
quarter growth of 7.1 percent probably sustained in the October-
December period, Balisacan said. Construction will grow robustly
next year, he said, even as an elevated peso threatens
competitiveness.  The peso has gained almost 7 percent this year, the best
performer after the South Korean won among  Asia ’s 11 most-widely
traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
