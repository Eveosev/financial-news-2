European stocks rose for the first
time in four days as U.S. President  Barack Obama  changed his
position on tax increases, leading to optimism that Democrats
and Republicans will agree on a compromise budget.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  climbed 1.2 percent as mining companies
gained after  China ’s policy makers set their economic-growth
target at 7.5 percent for next year.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  UBS
AG (UBSN)  gained 2.2 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, as the
shares of lenders rose.  Ratos AB (RATOA)  tumbled 5.1 percent after
saying it will pay a smaller dividend this year.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.5 percent to 280.46 at
the close of trading. The equity benchmark has rallied 15
percent this year, its first annual gain since 2010, as the
 European Central Bank  announced an unlimited bond-buying plan
and the  Federal Reserve  began a third round of asset purchases.  “It looks like the U.S. budget talks are getting better
and better,” said Pierre Mouton, who helps oversee $6 billion
as portfolio manager at Notz Stucki & Cie. in Geneva. “We’re
not quite there yet, but both camps seem to be trying to get to
an agreement. It’s quite positive and the market’s reaction is
linked to that.”  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600
companies was 37 percent greater than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On Spain’s IBEX
35 Index, the volume was more than double the average.  U.S. Budget  In the U.S., Obama, who met Republican House Speaker  John
Boehner  at the White House yesterday, softened his stance on the
budget. Obama was said to have lowered his target for new  tax
revenue  by $200 billion, offering to increase taxes for incomes
starting from $400,000 rather than $250,000.  Obama’s revised plan would raise $1.20 trillion in taxes
over the next decade and cut $1.22 trillion in spending,
according to a person familiar with the talks.  Lawmakers have until the end of the year to agree on
measures to prevent the so-called fiscal cliff of more than $600
billion of automatic tax increases and spending cuts from coming
into force in January.  In China, policy makers set their initial target for
 economic growth  at 7.5 percent for a second year, two bank
executives and a regulatory official briefed on the matter said.
The government of the world’s second-largest economy also plans
to keep  inflation  at about 3.5 percent, the people said. Chinese
officials made the forecasts during their annual central
economic work conference, which ended on Dec. 16.  National benchmark indexes gained in every western- European (SXXP) 
market except Denmark and  Greece . The U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.4
percent and  Germany ’s DAX added 0.6 percent.  France ’s CAC 40
rose 0.3 percent.  Mining Shares  A gauge of commodity producers posted the biggest gain of
the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600.  BHP Billiton , the
world’s largest mining company, climbed 1.2 percent to 2,150.5
pence. Rio Tinto Group, the second biggest, advanced 2.8 percent
to 3,568 pence.  Santander, Spain’s largest lender, added 2.2 percent to
5.96 euros and UBS, Switzerland’s biggest, increased 1.9 percent
to 15.25 Swiss francs.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS) 
rallied 3 percent to 22.3 euro cents. A gauge of banking shares
contributed the most to the Stoxx 600’s advance.  Imagination Technologies Group Plc (IMG)  jumped 7.1 percent to
410.9 pence. The U.K. maker of chip technology for tablets and
smart phones will probably succeed in buying MIPS Technologies
Inc.’s operating businesses, as Ceva Inc. hasn’t made a counter
offer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst  Sandeep Deshpande  wrote in a
note. Imagination agreed to buy MIPS for $100 million yesterday.  Actelion, Ratos  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  gained 1.1 percent to 45.52 francs. Patients
with moderate to severe psoriasis showed improvement after
taking the Ponesimod drug during a mid-stage trial, according to
a statement. The Allschwil, Switzerland-based company will now
proceed to the third phase of clinical development.  Ratos plunged 5.1 percent to 64.95 kronor, the biggest drop
on the Stoxx 600, after the Swedish private-equity firm said in
a statement it will cut its 2012 dividend to 3 kronor a share
from 5.50 kronor last year.  Petroleum Geo-Services ASA (PGS)  declined 1.8 percent to 95.40
kroner after the world’s third-largest seismic surveyor forecast
2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of $940 million to $980 million. The  average
analyst estimate  had called for Ebitda of $1 billion, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
