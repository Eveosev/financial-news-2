The U.K. government is reducing by
half to 45 days the minimum period large employers have to
consult staff before cutting more than 100 jobs.  The move is part of an attempt to lower the burden of
regulation on businesses, with the aim of encouraging them to
invest and take on employees.  “The 45 days will be a minimum consultation period,”
Business Minister Jo Swinson said in a  written statement to
Parliament  in  London  today. “We received plenty of evidence to
show that consultations can and do last longer than the minimum
period and we expect that to continue where circumstances make
this desirable.”  Chuka Umunna, the business spokesman for the opposition
 Labour Party , attacked the move on his Twitter Inc. feed.
“Ministers think watering down people’s rights at work is the
big bazooka to get growth going, and yet there is no evidence to
support this,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
