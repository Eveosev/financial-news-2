STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , Europe’s
biggest semiconductor manufacturer, said it will need to
increase quarterly revenue by as much as 25 percent to reach a
goal of operating profit at 10 percent of sales.  The manufacturer must generate revenue each quarter of
$2.25 billion to $2.5 billion to achieve its target, Chief
Executive Officer  Carlo Bozotti  said today at a press conference
in Paris. STMicroelectronics plans to report sales exceeding $10
billion a year by 2017, he said.  STMicroelectronics is pulling out of its unprofitable
wireless-chip joint venture with  Ericsson AB (ERICB)  as mobile-phone
manufacturing customers  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and BlackBerry maker  Research
In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  struggle with a sales slump. Bozotti, pushing to
put his Geneva-based company’s chips into cars, video-game
consoles and fitness machines, has a target of reducing net
operating expenses by as much as 33 percent by early 2014.  The third-quarter operating margin, excluding impairment
and reorganization charges and one-time items, was 0.3 percent
of revenue as earnings were held back by the venture,
STMicroelectronics said in its nine-month earnings  report . The
company said in a  statement  today that it’s sticking to a
forecast a week ago that the margin will grow “rapidly” toward
the 10 percent goal, and said it’s targeting “a significantly
higher level of profitability by 2017.”  Cost Targets  The program to reduce quarterly costs to $600 million to
$650 million by the beginning of 2014, from an average $900
million this year, will help the manufacturer achieve its margin
target, Bozotti said today.  STMicroelectronics  fell  as much as 2.1 percent to 5.18
euros and was trading down 1 percent at 2:46 p.m. in Paris,
where the company has its main listing. The stock, which was at
an eight-month high yesterday, has risen 14 percent this year,
valuing the company at 4.77 billion euros ($6.29 billion).  The quarterly revenue goal compares with analysts’
 estimates  that STMicroelectronics’ sales in the first three
months of 2013 will about match the $2 billion posted a year
earlier.  The ST-Ericsson venture was formed in 2009. It announced
plans in April to eliminate 1,700 jobs and transfer some product
development to STMicroelectronics.  The partners are discussing options for STMicroelectronics’
withdrawal, while Stockholm-based Ericsson, the world’s biggest
maker of mobile-phone networking equipment, believes technology
it contributed to the venture has “strategic value” for the
wireless industry, the companies said on Dec. 10. Bozotti
declined today to comment on the talks or on any plans regarding
the workforce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
