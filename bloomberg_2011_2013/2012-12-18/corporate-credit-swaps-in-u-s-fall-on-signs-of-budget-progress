A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell for the second day on signs that progress was being
made in talks to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 0.9
basis point to 91 basis points at 8:03 a.m. in New York. Thatâ€™s
the lowest intraday level since it reached 90.9 on Oct. 19.  A resolution to the budget negotiations may allay investor
concern that that the more than $600 billion in spending cuts
and tax increases that will take effect next month without
action by Congress will cause an economic contraction. President
 Barack Obama  lowered his tax revenue demand by $200 billion and
offered to start tax rate increases at $400,000 in income
instead of $250,000, moving closer to a budget deal.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
