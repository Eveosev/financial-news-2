Poolia AB (POOLB) , a Swedish recruiting
firm, fell the most in almost two months as it said further cost
cuts were needed and forecast an operating loss in the fourth
quarter.  Poolia stock  fell  as much as 11.5 percent to 10 kronor, its
biggest intraday decline since Oct. 26 and traded 7.5 percent
down at 10.45 kronor as of at 3:45 p.m. in Stockholm, valuing
the company at 179 million kronor ($27 million). Trading volume
was almost three times the daily three-month average.  Poolia expects a fourth-quarter operating loss, including
restructuring charges, of between 25 million kronor and 30
million kronor, due to depressed economic conditions, it said in
a statement today. That compares with a loss of 1.8 million
kronor a year earlier for the Stockholm-based company.  Poolia said it will need to reduce costs further and cut
more jobs, after implementing a program in the second quarter
aimed at saving an annual 20 million kronor.  “Due to the current downturn in the economy and weak
demand for our services, revenue has been less than expected,”
the company in the statement. “We now need to make further
savings including reducing staff.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
