India’s rupee forwards dropped a
fourth day after the central bank refrained from easing monetary
policy to support a slowing economy.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao kept the
 repurchase rate  at 8 percent, according to a statement in Mumbai
today. The decision was predicted by 25 of 27 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey, while two expected a reduction. The
monetary authority unexpectedly held the cash-reserve ratio for
lenders at 4.25 percent after a cut in October and said policy
focus needs to shift to growth “from this point onwards.”  “A cut in  interest rates  would be a positive for the
rupee,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a strategist at  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  in Singapore. Local importers’ demand for dollars also
pressured the currency lower, according to Westpac.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards declined 0.3 percent to
55.85 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Offshore non-deliverable contracts dropped 0.3 percent to 55.78.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  In the  spot market , the rupee was little changed from
yesterday at 54.8525 per dollar in Mumbai, after climbing as
much as 0.3 percent earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has fallen 3.6 percent this year after
plunging 16 percent in 2011.  Policy Decisions  India’s finance ministry yesterday said gross domestic
product will increase 5.7 percent to 5.9 percent this fiscal
year through March, less than an earlier estimate of as much as
7.85 percent. That would be the slowest pace in a decade and in
line with the central bank’s October forecast of 5.8 percent.  The rupee gained earlier after U.S. President  Barack Obama 
yesterday made a new budget offer as he and House Speaker  John
Boehner  negotiate to avert $607 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts set to take effect from January. Obama’s plan
would raise taxes by $1.2 trillion and increase rates for
households earning more than $400,000 a year, up from $250,000,
according to a person familiar with the talks.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, rose 15 basis points, or
0.15 percentage point, to 10.20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
