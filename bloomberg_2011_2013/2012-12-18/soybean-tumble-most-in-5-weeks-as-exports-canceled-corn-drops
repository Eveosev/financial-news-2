Soybean futures tumbled the most in
five weeks after  China , the world’s largest consumer, canceled
purchases from the U.S. Corn also declined.  Exporters said 420,000 metric tons of soybeans registered
for delivery before Sept. 1 were canceled, including 300,000
tons to China, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  reported today
in a  statement . The U.S. was the world’s largest grower and
shipper last year.  “The Chinese cancellations are driving people out of the
market and raising fears of a slowdown in U.S. exports,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services
Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Soybean futures for March delivery slid 1.9 percent to
close at $14.605 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest drop since Nov. 12. Yesterday, the price
touched $15.0125, the highest since Nov. 8. Still, the most-
active futures have gained 21 percent this year after a drought
in the U.S. reduced output and prompted concern that global
supplies will fall short of growing demand from China.  Prices also slipped on signs that wet weather will aid
crops in  South America . As much as 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of
rain will improve soil moisture for plant growth in  Paraguay  and
most of Brazil during the next two weeks, while delaying
planting in Argentina, the Commodity Weather Group LLC said in a
report.  Corn futures for March delivery declined 0.6 percent to
$7.20 a bushel in Chicago. The price has gained 11 percent in
2012 after drought cut U.S. production to a six-year low. The
grain reached a record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
