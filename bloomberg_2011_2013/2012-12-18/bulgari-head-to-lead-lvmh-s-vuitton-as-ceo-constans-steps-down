LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) 
said the head of its Bulgari unit will take charge of the Louis
Vuitton fashion and accessories brand, replacing Jordi Constans
who is leaving a month after taking the post because of illness.  Michael Burke, who only moved to Bulgari from LVMH’s Fendi
label in February, rejoins Vuitton, whose North American
business he ran from 1993 to 1997, the Paris-based company said
today in a statement. The executive, who has also worked at
Christian Dior Couture, joins LVMH’s executive committee, the
world’s largest luxury-goods maker said.  “I am convinced that he is the right leader for Louis
Vuitton’s future,” LVMH Chairman and CEO  Bernard Arnault  said
in the statement. “He will build on the initiatives launched by
Jordi Constans, bringing the vision and drive to continue
advancing Louis Vuitton’s leadership position in luxury.”  Constans is stepping down “due to the discovery of a
significant health issue,” LVMH said in a separate statement.
The 48-year-old executive became Vuitton CEO last month after
leaving yogurt maker Danone SA in 2011 to join LVMH.  Burke “is a very safe pair of hands,” said  Luca Solca ,
head of luxury-goods research at Exane BNP Paribas. “He has a
long history with the group. He has done very well with Fendi.
This is a choice for the known, rather than for the unknown.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
