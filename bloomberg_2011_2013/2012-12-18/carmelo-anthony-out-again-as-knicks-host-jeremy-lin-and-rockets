The  New York Knicks  will be missing
leading scorer Carmelo Anthony for the second straight game with
a sprained left ankle when they host Jeremy Lin and the Houston
Rockets tonight at Madison Square Garden.  Anthony, who was injured in the Knicks’ win last week
against the Los Angeles Lakers, will be replaced in the starting
lineup by rookie Chris Copeland.  “If he could play, I’m sure he would have been in uniform
tonight,” Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  told reporters. “But he
couldn’t go, and we’ve just got to move on and Cope’s got to
come in and play.”  The Knicks, who at 18-5 have the best record in the
National Basketball Association’s Eastern Conference, are 2-1
this season with Anthony on the bench due to injuries.  Anthony, 28, is averaging 27.9 points per game this season,  second in the NBA to the Lakers’  Kobe Bryant .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
