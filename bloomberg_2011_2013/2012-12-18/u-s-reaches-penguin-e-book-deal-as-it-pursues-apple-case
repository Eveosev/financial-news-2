The U.S.  Justice Department ’s
antitrust division said it will continue to litigate against
Apple Inc. and another publisher for conspiring to raise prices
of e-books after reaching a deal with  Pearson Plc (PSON) ’s Penguin
unit.  Penguin agreed to terminate agreements with Apple and other
e-book retailers and will be prohibited from entering new
agreements that limit retailers’ ability to offer discounts, the
Justice Department said in an e-mailed statement.  The department is reviewing the proposed joint venture
announced by Penguin and Random House Inc., the largest U.S.
book publisher. The terms of Penguin’s settlement will also
apply to that venture if it proceeds, the department said.  A trial against Apple and Verlagsgruppe Georg von
Holtzbrinck GmbH’s Macmillan unit is scheduled to begin in June.  A proposed final judgment was filed in federal court in
 Manhattan . Penguin has “now agreed to settle on substantially
the same terms as those contained in the original judgment, the
U.S. said in a competitive impact statement filed in court.  The case is U.S. v.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , 12-cv-02826, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
