Japan’s sale of 1.2 trillion yen
($14.3 billion) in 20-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted
price of 99.40, according to the median forecast of 13 traders
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 1.7 percent
bonds ranged from 99.30 to 99.50, according to the survey. Five
traders said 99.45 and three each said 99.40 and 99.35. One
trader reported 99.50 and one said 99.30.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
