Romania ’s negotiations with  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  on the exploration and production of shale gas will be an
“area of interest” for the country’s future government,
Designated Prime Minister Victor Ponta said.  Ponta wants Romanian companies to be competitive when
facing Polish companies, a country which has already started
exploitation of shale gas to lower energy costs, he said in an
interview with  Realitatea TV , a Bucharest-based private
television station, late yesterday.  Gazprom OAO (GAZP)  will be disadvantaged should Romania start
using shale gas to reduce its reliance on Russian gas, Ponta
said, according to Realitatea TV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
