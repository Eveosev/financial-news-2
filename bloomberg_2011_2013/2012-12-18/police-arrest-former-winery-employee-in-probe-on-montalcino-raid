Italian police arrested a former
employee of a Tuscan winery who allegedly destroyed 62,600
liters (16,537 gallons) of  Brunello di Montalcino  after he was
fired from his job.  The 39-year-old man from  Rome  “is accused of vandalism”
and “had been working for the winery for about five years
before being fired last month after disagreements about his
performance,” Colonel Marco Grandini of the carabinieri
military police in Siena said in a telephone interview. A number
of controls proved that his mobile phone was on the scene of the
crime when it happened, Grandini said.  In a Dec. 2 raid on the winery in Montalcino, 70 miles (113
kilometers) southwest of Florence, the man allegedly opened the
valves of 10 barrels containing six vintages of Brunello, some
of which had been aging since 2007, the police said. Just the
2007 vintage, which was ready to be bottled as Brunello, was
worth at least 2.5 million euros ($3.3 million), the police
said.  Brunello, one of  Italy ’s best known and most expensive red
wines, is made exclusively from Sangiovese grapes according to
standards set in 1888. The wine is aged in oak casks for five
years before it can be bottled.  The loss of the wine resulted in “considerable economic
damage,” Gianfranco Soldera, the winery’s owner, said in a
 statement  posted on the  company ’s website on Dec. 4. Soldera
said that his most recent vintage from 2006 had a wholesale
price of 110 euros a bottle.  To contact the reporters on this story:
