Syracuse University’s  Jim Boeheim 
became the third men’s coach in Division I college basketball
history with 900 wins as the third-ranked Orange held on for a
72-68 home victory against the University of Detroit.  Boeheim’s milestone win came with a struggle, as his team
had a 22-point lead cut to three in the closing minutes last
night at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. James
Southerland hit five 3-pointers and finished with 22 points for
the Orange, who improved to 10-0 on the season.  The 68-year-old Boeheim, in his 34th year at his alma
mater, joins  Mike Krzyzewski  and  Bob Knight  as the only men’s
coaches at college basketball’s top level with 900 career wins.
 Duke University ’s Krzyzewski is the career leader with 935 wins,
followed by Knight’s 902 victories.  Juwan Howard Jr., whose father starred at the University of
Michigan before playing in the National Basketball Association,
scored 16 of his 18 points during the second half to help
Detroit fight back from a 40-21 halftime deficit. The Titans had
a four-game winning streak end in falling to 6-5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
