South Korea’s bonds fell, pushing
the five-year yield to a four-month high, on signs U.S.
lawmakers are closer to resolving a budget impasse. The won
retreated from a 15-month high on suspected intervention.  U.S. stocks rallied yesterday as two people familiar with
the talks said President  Barack Obama  is considering budget
concessions after House Speaker  John Boehner  dropped opposition
to raising tax rates for top earners. Without an agreement, more
than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases will take
effect in January. South Korea’s National Pension Service plans
to boost investment in local equities by 22.5 percent from
September 2012 to December 2013, compared with a 1.8 percent
increase in local debt, it said in a statement yesterday.  “Investors had overreacted to the U.S. budget issue and
bonds are weakening as a resolution looks likely,” said Kong Dong Rak, a Seoul-based bond analyst at Hanwha Investment &
Securities Co. “‘With the NPS increasing bond investment by
only a small amount next year, there are concerns that bonds may
face a further correction.”  The yield on  South Korea ’s 2.75 percent notes due September
2017 increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
3.05 percent at the close in  Seoul , Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. That’s the highest  rate  for a benchmark five-year security
since Aug. 20. The yield has dropped 41 basis points this year.
The one-year interest-rate swap was steady at 2.82 percent.  Election Tomorrow  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,073.23 per dollar at the
close, after gaining as much as 0.2 percent earlier, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,070.73,
the strongest level since Sept. 8, 2011.  “It seems the government tried to prevent the won from
strengthening beyond the 1,070 per dollar level,” said Jude Noh,
chief currency trader at Suhyup bank in Seoul.  South Koreans vote tomorrow to replace President  Lee Myung
Bak , whose five-year term ends in February. Support for Park
Geun Hye from the ruling party stood at 48 percent, 0.5
percentage point ahead of opposition candidate Moon Jae In,
according to a Dec. 12 poll by the Seoul-based Realmeter and
JTBC, a cable television affiliate of the JoongAng Ilbo
newspaper. Local financial markets are closed tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
