Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, is scheduled to export 59 crude cargoes in February, a
partial loading program obtained by Bloomberg showed.  Daily exports in February are scheduled to be 1.74 million
barrels a day, according to the plan, which excludes four
grades. Total shipments for next month are planned at 2.12
million barrels a day, the full program for January showed.  The country plans to ship 12 consignments of its benchmark
Qua Iboe grade in February, one more than a revised schedule for
next month, the program showed. Exports of Bonny Light blend
will also increase by one lot to seven cargoes.  Nigeria will export eight cargoes of Forcados, six of
Agbami, five each of Bonga and Brass River, four lots of Usan,
three each of Akpo and Escravos, two each of Okono and Yoho and
one consignment each of Abo and EA Blend, the plans showed. No
shipment of Pennington was planned for February.  The schedules for Amenam, Antan, Erha, and Okwori grades,
which totaled 11 cargoes in January, were not yet available.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
