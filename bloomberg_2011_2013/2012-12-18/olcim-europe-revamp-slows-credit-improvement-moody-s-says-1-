Holcim Ltd.’s (HOLN)  accelerated
restructuring program to counter weaker demand for building
materials in Europe will slow the recovery of the firm’s credit
metrics this year, Moody’s Investors Service said.  Revamp costs of at least 100 million francs ($109 million)
in the fourth quarter will give the cement-maker a worse-than-
expected cash position at year-end, Moody’s analysts said in a
note published today. The ratings firms expects the cuts to
boost Zurich-based Holcim’s credit metrics “from a strategic
medium- to long-term perspective.”  Holcim, the only one of its peers to have kept an
investment grade rating, has had to double this year’s
restructuring costs and is writing off 410 million francs of
property plant and equipment. Chief Executive Officer Bernard Fontana is deepening a European savings effort which has already
included plant closures from  Hungary  to  Spain .  France’s  Lafarge SA (LG) , the second largest-cement maker behind
Holcim will follow Holcim in announcing restructuring measures
in Europe over the next one to two years, Moody’s analyst
Stanislas Duquesnoy said in a phone interview.  Holcim’s retained cash flow as a percentage of net debt, a
metric Moody’s uses to assign ratings, has improved materially
since the Swiss firm was assigned a negative outlook on its Baa2
rating in September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
