Components of Patriot missiles began
arriving in  Turkey  today, part of a NATO effort to defend the
country against hostile action by the regime in neighboring
 Syria , according to Turkish Ambassador to the U.S. Namik Tan.  “Some parts have started coming as of this morning,” Tan
said today at a breakfast with reporters in Washington. He said
it isn’t yet clear when the batteries will become operational.
Turkey is consulting with visiting delegations from other
countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as to where
the missiles will be placed, Tan said.  Asked if the missiles could be used to establish a no-fly
zone to provide rebels with air cover for operations, or whether
they could be used offensively, Tan said “These Patriots are
defensive, there is no offensive target.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
