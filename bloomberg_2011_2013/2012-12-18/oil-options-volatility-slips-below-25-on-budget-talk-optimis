Crude options volatility slipped
below 25 percent as futures rose on optimism that the White
House and Congressional Republican leaders will reach a budget
agreement in time to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 24.95 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 3:55 p.m., down from 25.84 percent
yesterday.  February-delivery crude oil advanced 73 cents to settle at
$88.40 a barrel on the Nymex, the third consecutive increase.  “We’re getting near the end of the year and people are
covering positions and crude has been in such a tight trading
range for the entire month, so people lost interest,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Futures rose as President  Barack Obama  and House Speaker
 John Boehner  negotiated to avert more than $600 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts set for January.
Boehner said today he expects to bring legislation before the
House by the end of the week.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
February $115 calls, which were unchanged at 4 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,221 at 3:54 p.m. March $75 puts were the second-most
active, with 1,114 lots exchanged as they declined 8 cents to 57
cents a barrel.  Calls Predominate  Bets that prices would rise, or calls, accounted for 53
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 59
percent of the 90,761 contracts traded.  February $75 puts were the most active options yesterday
with 7,497 contracts changing hands. They declined 2 cents to 23
