Argentines see consumer prices
rising 30 percent over the next 12 months, the same as last
month’s survey, according to the Buenos Aires-based  Torcuato Di
Tella University .  The estimate is almost three times the 10.6 percent
 inflation  rate reported by the national statistics institute for
November. Argentina’s official statistics have been questioned
by the  International Monetary Fund  and private economists since
early 2007, when then-President  Nestor Kirchner  made personnel
changes at the agency.  Argentina is on track to be the first country to be
censured by the Washington-based fund for not preparing accurate
data about inflation and economic growth. The  procedure could
end in expulsion from the organization.  The IMF’s board in September called on the government to
implement remedial measures “without delay.”  Yesterday, IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde 
presented a report on Argentina’s progress to the executive
board, leaving it to decide next month whether to censure the
South American country.  The poll released by Di Tella University was based on
responses by 1,201 people consulted by Poliarquia Consultores
pollster from Dec. 1 to Dec. 14 and has a margin of error of 3.5
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
