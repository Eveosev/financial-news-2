Uranium One Inc. (UUU) , which mines the
raw material used in reactor fuel, advanced the most in 16
months in Johannesburg trading after the pro-nuclear  Liberal
Democratic Party  won a landslide election victory in  Japan .  Shares in the Vancouver-based company jumped 13 percent,
the most since August 2011, to 18.29 rand by the close in
Johannesburg. More than 50,000 shares traded, almost three times
the daily average over the past three months.  The LDP captured a two-thirds majority in Japan’s lower
house of parliament in a Dec. 16 poll. The party campaigned on
Japan’s need to restart atomic reactors, shut down after last
year’s tsunami and earthquake triggered a meltdown at  Tokyo
Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, to
cut the cost of importing natural gas and coal to fire
conventional power stations.  “The Japanese election has given it a bit of a boost going
into the end of the year,” Brandon Sacks, a Johannesburg-based
trader at Avior Research Pty Ltd., said by phone. “It is one of
those stocks that guys will start liking now.”  The uranium producer’s  30-day historical volatility , a
measure of stock swings, increased to 53.53 from 40.91 on Dec.
14. The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s 30-day volatility
measure was at 8.61 from 8.51 previously. A higher reading means
an asset’s price can have bigger moves.  South Africa ’s markets
were closed for a public holiday yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
