OAO Dixy Group, a Russian
supermarket chain, climbed to the highest level in 10 months
after it was added to the benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  and as investors
speculated retailers may be allowed to boost their market share
in the regions.  Dixy surged as much as 6.4 percent before closing up 5.1
percent at 394.12 rubles in Moscow, the highest level since Feb.
24. The amount of shares traded was 177,330, over 10 times the
3-month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Moscow Exchange added 20 new stocks to the ruble-
denominated Micex gauge today, making its composition identical
to the 50-stock RTS Index.  Russia ’s antitrust watchdog may allow
retailers to exceed the 25 percent market-share limit if they
build new shopping areas, Interfax reported yesterday, citing
 Igor Artemyev , head of the anti-monopoly service. At present
retailers can’t add outlets in a region if they have more than a
quarter of the area’s total trade volume.  “Softer anti-monopoly rules would be welcome news for
Russia’s listed retailers,” Mikhail Terentiev, an analyst at
Otkritie Capital, said in an e-mailed report today. If the
proposal is adopted, “large retailers will be able to grow by
increasing their presence in their existing geographies, which
is typically less expensive and faster than conquering new
regions,” he said.  Consumer services shares gained 2.8 percent on average on
the Micex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
