Rubber advanced to a seven-month
high after President  Barack Obama  made a new budget offer,
raising optimism an agreement may be reached to avert automatic
spending cuts and tax increases in the world’s biggest economy.  Rubber for delivery in May rose as much as 0.6 percent to
285.9 yen a kilogram ($3,407 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange, the highest level for the most-active
contract since May 14. Futures traded at 284.5 yen at 11:44 a.m.
local time, extending this year’s gain to 8 percent.  Obama yesterday made the offer that would raise taxes by
$1.2 trillion and cut $1.22 trillion in spending, according to a
person familiar with the talks. Obama and House Speaker  John
Boehner  are negotiating to avert more than $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts set to start in January, known as
the fiscal cliff.   Asian stocks  jumped to a nine-month high and
crude oil advanced on signs of progress in the talks.  “Optimism about the U.S. budget deal is supporting the
market,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC
Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Futures also gained amid speculation that the  Bank of Japan 
may ease its monetary policy further after Shinzo Abe’s  Liberal
Democratic Party  swept to power, Shigemoto said. The Japanese
yen traded near its weakest level since April 2011 versus the
dollar, raising the appeal of yen-denominated contracts, before
the BOJ begins a two-day meeting tomorrow.  Rubber for delivery in May was little changed at 25,360
 yuan  ($4,067) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 1.6 percent to 95.60 baht ($3.13) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
