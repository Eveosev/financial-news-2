China ’s two-year  interest-rate swaps 
rose, approaching a 13-month high, as data released today showed
property prices increased in most cities.  The cost of a new home climbed in 53 of 70 cities surveyed
in November from the month before, compared with 35 cities in
October, according to a statistics bureau statement. The
People’s Bank of China’s  withdrew  125 billion yuan ($20 billion)
from the financial system last week in money-market operations.  “The housing market is turning around and should add to
gross domestic product growth in 2013,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong, wrote in a
report today. “This means property curbs will remain in place
for longer. To this end, the PBOC will tighten liquidity to
increase money-market rates and slow demand for housing.”  The two-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost to receive
the seven-day repurchase rate, rose two basis points to 3.43
percent in  Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate advanced 76 basis points, or 0.76 percentage point,
this year and touched 3.49 percent yesterday, the highest level
since Nov. 1, 2011.  China’s new leaders vowed to target “sustained and healthy
development” as they maintain a “prudent” monetary policy and
a “proactive” fiscal stance, according to a report on Dec. 16
by the state-run Xinhua News Agency after the annual central
economic work conference in Beijing.  The People’s Bank of China sold 55 billion  yuan  of 28-day
reverse-repurchase agreements at a yield of 3.6 percent today,
and 20 billion yuan of seven-day contracts at 3.35 percent,
according to a statement on its website.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, decreased three basis points to 3.01 percent in
Shanghai, according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. The rate fell 2.59 percentage
points this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
