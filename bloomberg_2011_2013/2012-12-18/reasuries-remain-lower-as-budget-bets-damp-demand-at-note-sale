Treasuries slid for a second day as
investors bet U.S. leaders will resolve a budget showdown and
the U.S. sold $35 billion of five-year debt to the lowest demand
in five months.  Thirty-year  bond yields  climbed to a three-month high as
President  Barack Obama  and House Speaker John Boehner negotiated
to end a stalemate that could push the economy into recession
next year. Yields on five-year securities climbed to the highest
level in seven weeks as the sale, the second of four note
offerings this week totaling $113 billion, drew bids for 2.72
 times  the amount offered, the least since July.  “The market’s definitely feeling like there’s more
potential for an agreement than that we reach Dec. 31 and
fail,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at
Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that
are required to bid at government-debt auctions.  Thirty-year yields climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 3 percent at 5 p.m. in New York, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. They reached 3.03 percent, the
highest since Sept. 17. The price of the 2.75 percent security
due in November 2042 dropped 1, or $10 per $1,000 face amount,
to 95 1/8.  The  yield  on the current five-year note increased three
basis points to 0.76 percent and reached 0.78 percent, the most
since Oct. 31. Benchmark 10-year  yields  touched 1.85 percent,
the highest level since Oct. 25, before trading at 1.82 percent.  Technical Support  The  10-year note  yield has technical support at 1.83
percent, which it failed to keep above on Oct. 25-26, the last
time it reached the level, Lederer said. There’s additional
demand at 1.88 percent, the top of the security’s range since
September, he said.  The yield breached 1.75 percent yesterday, its 200-day
moving average. It touched 1.56 percent on Dec. 6, the lowest
this month.  “I expect the range to hold right now,” said  Michael Cloherty , head U.S. interest-rate strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in New York, a primary dealer.
“The danger around here is the range has held for so long, if
you break it the next stop is a ways away.”  Treasuries fell even after Obama rejected an alternative
budget plan proposed by Boehner in talks to resolve the fiscal
showdown.  The president lowered his tax revenue demand yesterday by
$200 billion and offered to start tax-rate increases at $400,000
in income instead of $250,000. The House speaker told reporters
today Obama is “not there yet” on a balanced approach. Boehner
said he’ll push a budget “plan B” measure that will include
tax increases on income of more than $1 million a year. White
house spokesman Jay Carney said it isn’t credible.  Still Optimistic  “Even with some of the public political banter, markets
still feel optimistic there will be an agreement,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist in New York at Credit Suisse
Group AG, a primary dealer. “There has been a lot of movement
over the last few days. People are still continuing to be
optimistic and the base-case scenario is that there will be a
resolution.”  More than $600 billion in tax boosts and spending cuts will
automatically start taking effect in January unless an accord is
reached. Failing to avert the fiscal cliff may push the economy
in recession, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Auction Yield  The five-year notes sold today  yielded  0.769 percent,
compared with a forecast of 0.772 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven primary dealers. The record five-year auction
low was 0.584 percent at the July offering. It reached a 2012
high of 1.040 percent at the March sale.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 30.4 percent of
the notes, the most since September 2004.  Primary dealers  bought 37.2 percent of the notes, the least
since April 2010.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 32.4 percent, versus an average of 42.1
percent at the past 10 sales.  Five-year notes have returned 2.1 percent this year
compared with a 2 percent gain by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year
securities rose 9.2 percent in 2011, while Treasuries overall
advanced 9.8 percent.  The government auctioned $35 billion of two-year notes
yesterday at a yield of 0.245 percent. It will sell $29 billion
in seven-year securities tomorrow and $14 billion of five-year
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities on Dec 20.  The Federal Reserve bought $1.7 billion of Treasuries today
maturing from February 2036 to November 2042. It sold $7.6
billion of U.S. debt due in 2015. The transactions were part of
Operation Twist, under which the central bank replaces shorter-
maturity notes in its holdings with longer-term debt.  The program will expire this month, and the Fed will start
buying Treasuries next year in an expansion of a quantitative-
easing round.  To contact the reporters on this story:
