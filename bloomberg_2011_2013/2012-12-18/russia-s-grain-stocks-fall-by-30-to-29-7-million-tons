Russia, the third-biggest  wheat
exporter  last season, had 29.7 million metric tons of grain
stockpiles as of Dec. 1, down 30 percent from 42.3 million tons
a year earlier, the Federal State Statistics Service said.  The figure includes big agricultural producers that held
16.8 million tons, down from 25.3 million tons a year earlier,
and procurement and milling companies with 12.9 million tons,
down from 17 million tons, the service, known as Rosstat, said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Procurement firms and millers had about 8.6 million tons of
wheat stocks, of which 7 million tons was of milling quality,
Rosstat said. That’s down from about 12.5 million tons of the
grain, including 9.8 million tons of milling wheat, a year
earlier.  Most of the stocks, about 7.9 million tons, were in the
Central federal district, which was 6.3 percent less than a year
earlier, according to the statistics service. About 7 million
tons were in Volga, or almost 35 percent less than a year
earlier. Inventories in the Southern federal district fell about
38 percent to 4.7 million tons. The North-Caucasus federal
district had about 1.7 million tons, a decline of about 53
percent. The Southern and North-Caucasus districts are the
closest to  Russia ’s main export routes.  Rosstat’s figures don’t include small, private farms or
household reserves.  Wheat for March delivery was down 0.4 percent today at
$8.045 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The grain
advanced 23 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
