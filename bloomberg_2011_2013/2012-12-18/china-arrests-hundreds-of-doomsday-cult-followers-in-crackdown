Chinese authorities arrested more
than 450 people accused of belonging to a doomsday cult after
they held secret gatherings and spread leaflets,  China Central
Television  reported today on its website.  The group, called Almighty God, held eight illegal
gatherings in  Qinghai province  Dec. 5 and 6, and switched to
handing out leaflets and hanging up banners after an initial
police crackdown, CCTV reported.  The group is a Christianity-inspired “evil cult” that
believes the world will end Dec. 21 and is urging members to
wage war against the ruling Communist Party, which it called
“the big red dragon,” Chinese Business View, a newspaper based
in northwestern province of Shaanxi, reported last week.  The official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday that
 China  arrested 101 members of the cult across the country,
including 37 in Qinghai.  The people were detained for spreading rumors and
disturbing social order in the name of religion, Xinhua said.
China carried out a nationwide crackdown on the Falun Gong
spiritual movement in 1999, putting thousands of members behind
bars.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
