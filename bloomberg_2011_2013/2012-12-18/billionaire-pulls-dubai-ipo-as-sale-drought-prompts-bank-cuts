Al Habtoor Group LLC,  controlled by
billionaire Khalaf Al Habtoor, delayed an initial share sale in
Dubai as trading volumes fail to rebound in the Persian Gulf
business hub.  “After a thorough evaluation I have decided to postpone
the IPO,” Al Habtoor said in an e-mailed statement. “It is a
moral issue not taking the group public at this time.”  Grant
Thornton  valued the company at 22 billion dirhams ($6 billion).  Trading volumes in Dubai remain near a six-year low even as
the benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  climbed 17 percent this year,
making it the best-performing equity gauge in the Persian Gulf.
Global banks are trimming staff amid the slump, with  Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604)  and Credit Suisse AG among those cutting their
investment banking divisions. Shuaa Capital PJSC, controlled by
Dubai ruler’s company, is closing its retail brokerage as
business dries up.  Arab uprisings that ousted leaders in Tunisia, Libya and
Egypt and the debt crisis in  Europe  have slowed regional share
sales in the past two years. Money raised from IPOs in the
 Middle East  and Africa fell to $5 billion this year and $4.8
billion in 2011 from $22 billion in 2008, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Axiom Ltd., a Dubai-based phone retailer, in 2010 canceled
plans to raise about $100 million because of “widespread
concerns about market conditions and liquidity.” Topaz Energy &
Marine Plc, a Dubai-based oil and gas services company, in March
last year pulled an IPO in  London , citing “uncertain investment
climate for new issues.”  Waldorf Astoria  Al Habtoor, which is developing the Waldorf Astoria on
artificial islands off Dubai’s coast, has investments in the
hotel, automotive and real-estate industries and has a joint
venture in the Middle East with  Leighton Holdings Ltd., (LEI) 
 Australia ’s biggest builder. Earnings are forecast to climb 16
percent this year to more than 700 million dirhams after
investments of 5.9 billion dirhams in the hospitality industry,
according to the company statement today.  Grant Thornton’s valuation excluded two hotels, a shopping
mall and a theme park in Lebanon as well as Le Meridien Budapest
in Hungary, Al Habtoor said. It also excluded the value of
shareholding in Habtoor Leighton Group and several other
investments in public shareholding companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
