Fund manager Wolfgang Floettl and
five others who helped run up as much as 1.7 billion euros ($2.3
billion) of losses at Bawag PSK Bank AG were acquitted of
misusing funds after a retrial in  Austria ’s biggest ever white-
collar crime case.  Floettl, 57, the four Bawag managers accused along with him
and one of the lender’s auditors, were found not guilty by Judge
Christian Boehm, Vienna criminal court spokeswoman Christina
Salzborn said in an e-mailed statement. The court overturned an
earlier verdict after Austria’s highest court ordered the
retrial in 2010.  “The court’s main reason for the acquittal was the lack of
evidence for intent and purpose” of the accused, Salzborn said.
Floettl, who is married to a granddaughter of former U.S.
President Dwight Eisenhower, had been found guilty of misuse of
funds in the first trial against the group in 2008.  Floettl had run up the losses for Bawag, which was then
owned by Austria’s trade union federation, from the late 1990s
mostly with wrong-way bets on the Japanese yen. The losses
weren’t discovered until U.S. futures broker Refco Inc.
collapsed into bankruptcy in 2006. Their discovery eventually
forced the union to sell Bawag to private-equity firm Cerberus
Capital Management LP in 2007.  Former Bawag Chief Executive Officer Helmut Elsner, 77, was
already sentenced to 10 years in jail, the toughest possible
punishment for misuse of funds and other crimes for which he was
convicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
