Abengoa SA (ABG)  said it temporarily
suspended ethanol production at its plant in Rotterdam while it
completes occupational and environmental improvement projects.  The facility is Europeâ€™s largest ethanol plant, able to
produce 480 million liters of the biofuel annually and 360,000
metric tons of  animal feed , according to an e-mailed statement
dated Dec. 14. The plant, which started operations in 2010, is
on a 23-hectare (57-acre) site with storage capacity for more
than 55,000 tons of grain. The plant also has a delivery system
that enables ships to unload at a designated grain dock.  The plant may be closed for as much as three months while
maintenance is completed, the company said. The plant uses 1.2
million tons of grain annually. Abengoa is based in Seville,
 Spain .  To contact the reporter on this story:
