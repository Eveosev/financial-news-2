Palm oil retreated on concern that
stockpiles in  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest producer, may
remain near record levels as exports decline.  The contract for March delivery, the most-active by volume,
fell as much as 0.6 percent to 2,336 ringgit ($767) a metric ton
on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange and ended the morning
session at 2,341 ringgit. Futures are heading for a 26 percent
drop this year, the worst annual loss since the financial crisis
in 2008.  Stockpiles in Malaysia climbed to an all-time high of 2.56
million tons in November, the nation’s palm oil board said Dec.
10. The country will allow duty-free exports of crude palm oil
in January after fixing the average price for calculating the
tax at 2,147.81 ringgit a ton, below the minimum threshold of
2,250 ringgit. Shipments fell 3.3 percent to 734,571 tons in the
first 15 days of December from a month earlier, Societe General
de Surveillance said yesterday.  “The market has been range-bound, pressured by high
stockpiles,” Vijay Mehta, a director at Commodity Links Pte.,
said by phone from  Singapore . “All destinations are not buying
at the moment. December and January are lean demand periods, but
the palm-soybean oil differential will ensure some demand.”  Inventories in  China , biggest buyer after  India , totaled
890,000 tons last weekend and may reach a record of 1 million
tons, Grain.gov.in said today. Large domestic stockpiles may be
difficult to digest with no improvement in demand, it said.  Soybean oil for delivery in March gained 0.3 percent to
50.37 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, making it
$344.66 a ton more  expensive  than palm oil. Palm and soybean
oils are both used in food and fuel.  Palm oil for May delivery rose 0.2 percent to 6,842  yuan 
($1,098) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange. Soybean oil for
May gained 0.2 percent to 8,806 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
