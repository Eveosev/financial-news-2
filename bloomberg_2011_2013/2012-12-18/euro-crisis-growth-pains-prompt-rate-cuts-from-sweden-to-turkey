Central banks in Sweden,  Hungary  and
 Turkey  cut interest rates today as the fallout from the euro
area’s sovereign-debt crisis dims growth prospects for some of
the biggest economies in its vicinity.  The Swedish repo rate was lowered by a quarter of a
percentage point to 1 percent, the Stockholm-based Riksbank
said, as it signaled it will probably keep the benchmark
unchanged until the end of 2013. Hungary’s central bank cut the
European Union’s highest benchmark rate for a fifth month and
its counterpart in Turkey lowered its benchmark interest rate
today for the first time in 16 months to a record low.  The decisions follow the European Central Bank’s revelation
that the euro region may need to wait until the second half of
next year for a recovery. While the ECB benchmark rate is
already at a record-low 0.75 percent, a majority of policy
makers were also open to easing borrowing costs on Dec. 6,
according to three officials speaking on condition of anonymity.  “It’s rather similar in these countries.” Lars Christensen, chief emerging-market analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) ,
said in a telephone interview from Copenhagen. “We see economic
weakness globally, that is triggering monetary easing by
basically all major central banks, or at least there are
expectations of that.”  Swedish Cut  Sweden ’s central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate
for a fourth time in a year. The country’s $540 billion economy,
which relies on exports for about half its output, is struggling
to expand as the debt crisis in Europe erodes demand for its
goods and services.  The Riksbank, which provides investors with predictions on
future borrowing costs, said it expects the rate to be at 1.1
percent in a year, versus an October forecast of 1.3 percent.
Officials also cut their outlook for economic growth next year,
predicting 1.2 percent expansion, compared with an October
forecast of 1.8 percent.  “They did the right thing,” said Knut Hallberg, an
analyst at  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  in  Stockholm . “There is a slight, slight
chance of another cut” next year as “it’s going to be a tough
winter.”  Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves predicted today that “both
growth and inflation will be slow” in 2013 because consumer
sentiment has weakened and exports will suffer from weaker
European demand. Ericsson AB, the world’s largest maker of
mobile phone networks, and truck maker  Volvo AB (VOLVB) , are among
Swedish companies cutting thousands of jobs in response to
shrinking markets.  The krona was up 0.3 percent to 8.7372 against the euro as
of 2:23 p.m. in Stockholm.  Eastern Europe  In Hungary, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank lowered the two-week
deposit rate to 5.75 percent from 6 percent, the fifth quarter-
point cut in as many months, matching the forecast of all 19
economists in a Bloomberg survey. That move chimes with the
policy of central banks across eastern  Europe .  The Hungarian forint fell to the lowest level in almost
five months today, trading 0.2 percent lower at 288.61 per euro
by 3:31 p.m. in Budapest.  Central bankers in  Poland , the only country in the 27-
nation European Union to raise rates this year, cut borrowing
costs on Dec. 5 and said they will ease policy further as the
EU’s biggest eastern economy faces the risk of its first
recession in two decades. It may cut the benchmark for a third
month in January from 4.25 percent, policy maker Jerzy Hausner
said Dec. 12.  ‘Strengthen Exports’  The Czech central bank reduced the main two-week repurchase
rate to a record-low 0.05 percent on Nov. 1, almost three-
quarters of a point less than the euro-area benchmark. Don Egginton, an economist at Daiwa Capital Markets in  London ,
predicts that Czech officials may next resort to other measures
to aid economic growth.  “They might stimulate their economy to use foreign
reserves to weaken the currency and strengthen exports,” said
Egginton, a former official at the Bank of England. “There are
some members of the Monetary Policy Committee against the idea,
but it’s just a matter of timing about when they initiate that
policy.”  Turkey’s central bank today cut its benchmark one-week
repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent in its first
such reduction since August 2011.  “Turkey has most of its remittances from  Germany , so if
German growth weakens, Turkey’s situation also weakens,” said
James Reeve, an economist at Riyadh-based  Samba Financial Group. (SAMBA)   Lira Gains  The Turkish lira strengthened 0.2 percent against the
dollar at 1.7807 at 3:07 p.m. in Istanbul, as the bank cut the
benchmark repurchase rate to spur economic growth and kept the
overnight borrowing interest rate unchanged. The move was “less
dovish than what the markets expected,” Luis Costa, an emerging
market strategist at Citigroup in London, said in an e-mailed
note.  Today’s actions follow in the wake of a reduction in
economic forecasts by the Frankfurt-based ECB. Officials
predicted the 17-nation region will contract 0.5 percent this
year and 0.3 percent in 2013.  ECB President Mario Draghi still said yesterday that ECB
policies and governance reforms in the euro area have revived
confidence that will help foster a gradual economic recovery in
the second half of next year.  ‘Gradual Improvement’  “The impression that one has of this year, at least of the
second part of this year, is of a gradual improvement in
financing conditions which is one of the reasons why we foresee
a beginning of a recovery in the second part of next year,”
Draghi said in testimony at the European Parliament’s Economic
and Monetary Affairs Committee in Brussels. Still, “the medium-
term outlook for economic activity remains challenging.”  Unlike the central banks taking decisions today, the ECB,
the U.S. Federal Reserve, the  Bank of Japan  and the Bank of
England have recently focused more on unconventional policies to
stimulate growth after already bringing down interest rates.  In the U.K., which sells about half of its exports to the
euro region, the Bank of England kept its quantitative-easing
target at 375 billion pounds ($608 billion) on Dec. 6 after
halting bond purchases the previous month. Governor Mervyn King
has left the door open to more stimulus if needed and the BOE is
also trying to spur a recovery with a credit boosting plan.  “The central and eastern European central banks are really
just following what’s happening in the U.S., Britain or  Japan ,”
said Danske Bank’s Christensen. “They probably also feel more
comfortable to act when everybody else is easing policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
