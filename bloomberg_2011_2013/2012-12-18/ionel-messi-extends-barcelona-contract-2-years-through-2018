Lionel Messi , who broke soccer’s
calendar-year scoring record earlier this month, agreed to
extend his contract with Barcelona by two years through June
2018.  Carles Puyol  and Xavi Hernandez will lengthen their deals
through June 2016, Barcelona said in a  statement  on its website.  “This news means that FC Barcelona has secured its ties
with three of its most important players,” the 21-time Spanish
league champion club said.  Messi, 25, scored twice against Real Betis on Dec. 9 to
overtake Gerd Muller’s record 85 goals in 1972. The Argentina
captain’s 2012 tally now stands at 90.  He’s also in the running to be named the world’s best
player for a fourth consecutive year. He’s short-listed for the
FIFA Ballon d’Or award with teammate  Andres Iniesta  and Real
Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo.  Barca currently leads the Spanish standings by nine points
from Atletico Madrid as it strives to regain the title. Holder
Real Madrid is four points further back.  “Over the course of the next few weeks, Carles
Puyol,  Xavi Hernandez  and Leo Messi will all be signing their
respective new contracts,” Barcelona said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
