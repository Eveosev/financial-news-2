(Corrects headline, first and second paragraphs to show
survey reflects commodity demand, not price.)  China  will drive demand for food and
farm products in the next decade, Rabobank International said,
citing a poll it performed of food and agribusiness executives.  Sixty-one percent of the 350 executives polled said China
will be the country or region to have the largest impact on
commodity demand in the next 10 years, followed by India and
 Africa , the bank said today in an e-mailed statement. Forty
percent said China will be the primary driver of world economic
growth in the next 50 years. Weather extremes were cited by 68
percent of respondents as the biggest factor affecting North
American food and agribusiness in 2013, ahead of consumer demand
and government regulations.  Two-thirds of those polled said U.S. corn yields may top
200 bushels an acre by 2025, Rabobank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
