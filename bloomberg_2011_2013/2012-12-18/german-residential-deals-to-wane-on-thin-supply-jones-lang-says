Private-equity firms, pension funds,
residential landlords and other large investors bought the most
German homes since 2007 this year and purchases will decline in
the next 12 months as less property comes up for sale, according
to a forecast by  Jones Lang  LaSalle Inc.  Large investors will probably buy 8 billion euros ($10.5
billion) of German homes in 2013, compared with 10.8 billion
euros in 2012, the Chicago-based broker said today.  “This year was characterized by a few large deals that
made up almost 5 billion euros of the total,” Helge
Scheunemann, Jones Lang’s head of German research, said at a
press conference in Berlin today. “We’re a bit more cautious on
our outlook for next year.”  Investment funds are buying groups of German homes because
they are looking for a safe investment as  interest rates  hover
near record lows amid  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis. Deals were
fueled by the sale of almost 100,000 apartments by companies
that needed to pay debts from last decade’s buyout boom.  Large deals this year include the auction of 21,000
apartments by Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in April and a
Barclays Plc unit’s sale of 23,500 apartments in July.  Sales next year will include Bayerische Landesbank 32,000
apartments held by its GBW unit, and 38,000 belonging to  Gagfah
SA (GFJ) , Scheunemann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
