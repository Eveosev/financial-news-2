Jeremy Lin had 22 points and eight
assists in his return to Madison Square Garden as the Houston
Rockets defeated the Knicks 109-96 tonight to hand New York its
first home loss of the season.  Lin, 24, who became a National Basketball Association
phenomenon last February for the Knicks, moved to Houston as a
free agent during the offseason after New York declined to match
the Rocketsâ€™ three-year, $25 million contract offer.  James Harden had 28 points and 10 rebounds for Houston
(12-12). Chris Copeland, starting in place of the injured
Carmelo Anthony, had 29 points to lead New York (18-6), which
had won its first 10 home games of the season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
