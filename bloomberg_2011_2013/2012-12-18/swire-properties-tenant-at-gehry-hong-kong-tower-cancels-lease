Swire Properties Ltd. (1972)  said a tenant
has withdrawn from the HK$850,000 ($109,676) a month lease for
an apartment in Opus Hong Kong, the building designed by  Frank
Gehry .  The developer has put the duplex back on the market for
lease, Hong Kong-based Swire Properties said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. The lease for the unit, which has its
own pool, was for three years, the company said earlier.  Hong Kong home prices have declined 1.4 percent from a
record in the four weeks to Dec. 9, after the government imposed
a 15 percent tax on non-local and corporate homebuyers as part
of measures to curb demand. The city is the world’s most
expensive place to buy an apartment, according to property
broker  Savills Plc. (SVS)   May Lam, a spokeswoman for the developer, declined to
identify the tenant canceling the lease.  An unidentified buyer in October bought a 6,683-square-foot
(621-square-meter) unit in Opus  Hong Kong , located in the city’s
Peak district, for HK$455 million, or a record HK$68,083 per
square foot. The company sold another one in the building in
August for HK$430 million.  Those two transactions have been completed, Swire
Properties said in yesterday’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
