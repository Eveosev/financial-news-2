Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index headed for the highest close since March, as
U.S. President  Barack Obama  made concessions in negotiations to
break the budget impasse, according to a person familiar with
the talks.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which depends on America for a
fifth of its revenue, rose 0.8 percent in  Seoul  after Apple
Inc.’s bid to ban its rival’s products in the U.S. was denied.
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)  rose 3.8 percent, pacing
gains among Japanese banks on prospects the nation’s central
bank may ease monetary policy further.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) 
surged 17 percent after jumping 33 percent yesterday on
speculation  Japan ’s new political leadership may allow nuclear
reactors to restart.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5 percent to 127.95 as
of 7:46 p.m. in  Tokyo , headed for its highest close since March
27. About six shares advanced for every four that fell on the
measure. Obama is negotiating with lawmakers to head off the so-
called fiscal cliff, more than $600 billion in automatic
spending cuts and tax increases due in January.  On U.S. budget talks, “we are now getting some signs at
least that negotiations are continuing, and that is a positive
development,” saidBelinda Allen, a senior investment analyst
at Colonial First State Global Asset Management in Sydney, which
oversees about $145 billion. “There’s a view that the  Bank of
Japan  will become a little more aggressive in terms of asset
purchases and really trying to depreciate the yen, so that could
certainly help the Japanese market particular.”  Relative Value  Asia’s benchmark equities index rose 12 percent this year
as central banks from the U.S., Europe, Japan and China took
action to spur economic growth. The gauge traded at 14.5 times
average estimated earnings, compared with 13.8 for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 times for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 1 percent,
extending an eight-month high, while the broader Topix Index
climbed 1.1 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index added 0.2
percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent as minutes of
the central bank’s Dec. 4 meeting showed it cut  interest rates 
as a softer labor market gave it room to implement measures to
bolster demand. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index increased 0.3
percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index added 0.5 percent.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.1 percent after
rising as much as 1.1 percent. The nation’s foreign trade will

bigger” than in 2011, the commerce ministry said. Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index lost 0.1 percent and Taiwan’s Taiex Index rose
0.2 percent.  Singapore’s Straits Times Index slipped 0.1 percent. A
gauge of  smaller companies  listed in the city-state increased
for a 23rd day, extending its longest-ever streak of gains.  Budget Offer  Futures on the  S&P 500  advanced 0.3 percent today. The
gauge surged 1.2 percent to a two-month high yesterday as there
appeared to be progress on U.S. budget negotiations.  Obama made a new offer that would raise taxes by $1.2
trillion and increase tax rates for households earning more than
$400,000 a year, up from $250,000, said a person familiar with
the talks. Obama and House Speaker  John Boehner  are negotiating
to avert the budget impasse.  Exporters to the U.S. gained, with Samsung adding 0.8
percent to 1.515 million won. The stock also rose after a U.S.
judge rejected Apple’s attempt to ban Samsung products after a
jury in August found infringement of the iPhone maker’s patents.

percent to 410 yen.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-

Kansai Electric Power Co. dropped 4.5 percent to 879 yen,
following an 18 percent rally yesterday.  Sharp Climbs  Sharp Corp. jumped 8.6 percent to 327 yen in Tokyo as

which said last month there was “material doubt” about its
ability to survive, reached an agreement this month to sell as
much as 9.9 billion yen ($118 million) of shares to San Diego-
based Qualcomm Inc. Sharp has added 60 percent since Dec. 10.  Among stocks that fell,  Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. (047810)
