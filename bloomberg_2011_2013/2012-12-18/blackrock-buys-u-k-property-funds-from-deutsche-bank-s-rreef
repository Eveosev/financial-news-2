BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
money manager, agreed to buy U.K. property funds run by  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) ’s RREEF real estate affiliate.  BlackRock’s  U.K. Property Fund (MRCPTYI)  will add 27 real estate
investments valued at more than 335 million pounds ($543
million) in the deal, bringing assets under management to more
than 2.4 billion pounds, the New York-based firm said in a
statement today. RREEF’s U.K. retail,  office  and industrial
property funds are included in the acquisition. The
transaction’s terms weren’t disclosed.  The deal “increases and further diversifies the fund’s
client base by an additional 64 investors, giving them access to
a longstanding U.K. real estate platform,” BlackRock said in
the statement.  BlackRock can improve the value of some of the assets
formerly managed by RREEF and this will be “accretive to the
future performance” of the fund, the firm said. BlackRock’s
U.K. fund has returned 8.8 percent a year for the last 20 years
and its investments include doctors’ offices, marinas and
warehouses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
