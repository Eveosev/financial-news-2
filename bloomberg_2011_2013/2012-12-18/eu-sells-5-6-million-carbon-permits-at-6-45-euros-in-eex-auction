The European Union sold 5.6 million
metric tons of prompt carbon permits for 2013 through 2020 at
6.45 euros ($8.50) a metric ton, according to the European
Energy Exchange AG in Leipzig,  Germany .  Demand exceeded supply in the sale by a factor of 2.41,
compared with 2.51 in a Dec. 13 sale of 5.5 million tons,  data
published  today on EEXâ€™s website show.  The EU sale, the last for this year, raised 36 million
euros from nine successful bidders, EEX said. Prompt Phase 3
allowances rose 1.4 percent to 6.56 euros a ton on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in  London  at 2:26 p.m. The phase runs
for the eight years starting next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
