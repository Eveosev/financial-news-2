Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  and  Intel Corp. (INTC) ,
investors in wireless broadband venture  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) , agreed
to sell their stakes to  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  for $2.97 a share
even if investors reject Sprint’s offer.  Clearwire said yesterday that its  board  agreed to an
increased offer of $2.2 billion from Sprint, which is seeking
full ownership of the company. Comcast and Intel, along with
Bright House Networks LLC, own about 13 percent of Clearwire’s
voting shares, the companies said.  The deal with the investors is conditional on the
completion of Softbank Corp.’s $20.1 billion bid for Overland
Park, Kansas-based Sprint, according to a regulatory filing
today. Even if that deal collapsed, the companies would sell
their stakes if Sprint completes an alternative transaction, the
filing shows.  Cable-television operator Comcast and Intel, the world’s
largest semiconductor maker, bought into Bellevue, Washington-
based Clearwire in 2008 alongside Sprint. The phone company is
garnering support from them even as minority shareholders such
as Mount Kellett Capital Management LP and Crest Financial Ltd.
are challenging the deal.  Crest increased its stake in Clearwire to 8.34 percent from
6.62 percent, according to a separate filing today. The company
said in a statement accompanying the filing that it “continues
to oppose the proposed merger of Clearwire with Sprint.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
