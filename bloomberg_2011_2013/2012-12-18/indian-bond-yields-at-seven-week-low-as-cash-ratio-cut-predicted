India’s 10-year bond yield held at a
seven-week low on optimism the central bank will cut  reserve
requirements  for lenders for a fifth time this year to release
more funds into markets and support the economy.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will reduce the cash-reserve
 ratio  by 25 basis points to 4 percent today, according to 20 of
24 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. One predicts a 50
basis point cut while the rest see no change. The  economy  will
expand by about 5.7 percent to 5.9 percent in the year through
March, the  finance ministry  said yesterday, less than an earlier
forecast of as much as 7.85 percent.  “The reserve requirement may be cut to keep liquidity
comfortable and to signal the RBI is committed to a softening
cycle,” said Killol Pandya, the Mumbai-based head of fixed-
income investments at the local unit of Daiwa Asset Management
Co. “At the macro level, nothing much has changed since the
last policy so  interest rates  are unlikely to be cut.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 was
little changed at 8.14 percent as of 9:35 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s the
lowest level since Oct. 29. The yield dropped 43 basis points
this year as the central bank cut the reserve ratio by 175 basis
points and the repurchase rate by 50 basis points.  The central bank will hold the repo rate at 8 percent,
according to 25 of 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  State Bank
of India (SBIN) , the nation’s largest lender, predicted a 50 basis
point decrease while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast a 25
basis point reduction.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point to 7.64 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
