Light Louisiana Sweet gained more
than other  Gulf of Mexico  crudes on the  spot market  as the
spread between West Texas Intermediate and Brent widened.  The discount for February West Texas Intermediate oil
versus Brent widened 47 cents to $20.44 a barrel, based on
futures settlement prices. When Brent gains versus WTI, it
typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium  to WTI widened $1.05 to
$21.75 at 4:02 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Premiums for other Gulf crudes were mixed. Mars Blend’s
premium was unchanged at a $16.25 premium, while Southern Green
gained 10 cents to $16.50 a barrel over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium narrowed 15 cents to $16.75 a barrel
over WTI. The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green, narrowed
by 40 cents to $18.25.  The discount for Western Canada Select for February
delivery versus West Texas Intermediate was unchanged at $35.50
a barrel at 2:49 p.m.  New York  time, according to  Net Energy
Inc. , a Calgary oil broker.  Syncrude’s premium for February was unchanged and at parity
to WTI, Net Energy said. Bakken was unchanged at a $4-a-barrel
discount to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
