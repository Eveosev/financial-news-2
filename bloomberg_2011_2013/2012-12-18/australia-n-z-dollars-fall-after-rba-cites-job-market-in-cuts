The Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell for a second day versus their U.S. peer after the
Reserve Bank of  Australia  cited a weaker labor market as a
reason for its decision this month to cut interest rates.  The Aussie declined after minutes of the RBA’s Dec. 4
meeting showed it said growth is stabilizing in  China . Policy
makers at the meeting lowered the bank’s overnight cash-rate
target to 3 percent, from 3.25 percent. New Zealand’s dollar
fell versus all of its most-traded counterparts except the yen
after the Treasury Department cut its budget-surplus forecast
for 2015.  “Policy makers suggested that their decision to ease was
driven by a softened outlook for investment as well as weakened
expectations for employment growth,” Eric Theoret, a currency
strategist in Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital
unit, wrote yesterday in a note to clients. “The range in
Aussie-dollar is likely to remain constrained, given the absence
of a catalyst.”  Australia’s currency depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.0535
yesterday in New York. It rose 0.2 percent to 88.71 yen.  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, sank 0.4
percent to 84.14 U.S. cents after declining as much as 0.6
percent, its biggest intraday drop since Nov. 14. The kiwi was
little changed at 70.86 yen.  The Aussie may rise to $1.10 should it break above $1.06, a
key resistance level, according to Takuya Kawabata, a researcher
in  Tokyo  at Gaitame.com. Resistance is an area on a chart where
sell orders may be clustered.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials increased
0.5 percent and crude-oil futures gained 0.8 percent to $87.89
per barrel in New York. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  rose 1.2 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 5.7 percent this
year, the biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation
currencies monitored by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes, and the Aussie has gained 0.1 percent. The U.S. dollar
has fallen 3.3 percent, and the yen has dropped 13 percent to
lead decliners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
