Taiwan ’s government bonds dropped,
pushing the 10-year yield to a two-month high, as optimism U.S.
lawmakers will agree on budget revisions tempered demand for
safer assets. The local dollar was steady.  President  Barack Obama  is considering a concession on cost-
of-living increases for  Social Security  and House Speaker  John
Boehner  dropped his opposition to raising tax rates for some top
earners, two people familiar with the talks said. Taiwan’s
central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan, who said on Dec. 12 that
the island’s economy is rebounding steadily, will keep the
benchmark  interest rate  at 1.875 percent at a review tomorrow,
according to all 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Looks like there’s progress made with the fiscal-cliff
situation, and that boosts risk-taking,” said Eric Hsing, a
fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.
“Traders aren’t expecting any change in monetary policies
tomorrow, but it looks like the central bank is quite optimistic
about the outlook.”  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 rose to 1.148 percent from 1.144 percent
yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market. It touched
1.151 percent earlier, the highest level since Oct. 18. The
yield has dropped 14 basis points this year.  Global funds bought $1.4 billion more Taiwanese stocks than
they sold this month, taking net purchases in 2012 to $4.6
billion, exchange data show.  Taiwan Dollar  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed at NT$29.1 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to data from Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency touched NT$28.959 on Nov. 12, the strongest level since
September 2011. It has appreciated 4.1 percent this year, poised
for a fourth annual gain.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, slipped 14 basis points to 2.95 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at
0.385 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
