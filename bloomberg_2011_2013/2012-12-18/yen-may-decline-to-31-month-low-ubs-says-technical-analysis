The yen may weaken to the lowest
level in more than 31 months against the dollar if the U.S.
currency ends the week above a key support level, according to 
 UBS AG (UBSN) , citing technical indicators.  If the Japanese currency breaches support at 84.20 per
dollar, it could decline to 94.13, the 38 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the yen’s appreciation from June 2007 to October
2011,  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy at
UBS in  London , wrote today in a note to clients. It last touched
that level in May 2010.  “A weekly close (of the dollar) above 84.20 would trigger a 
much more significant trend change from a longer-term perspective, 
at which point we’d be looking for a much more prolonged uptrend to
materialize,” Adcock said in a telephone interview.  Japan’s tender fell 0.4 percent to 84.21 per dollar at 2:18
p.m. in  New York  after touching 84.48 yesterday, its weakest
level since April 2011.  The yen has declined 13 percent this year, the worst
performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar fell 3.4
percent, while the  New Zealand dollar  led all gainers with a 5.7
percent increase.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
