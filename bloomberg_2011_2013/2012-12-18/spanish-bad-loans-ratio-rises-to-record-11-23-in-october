Bad loans  as a proportion of total
lending at Spanish banks climbed to a record 11.23 percent in
October as the country’s economic slump led more companies and
homeowners to miss credit payments.  The  proportion  rose from 10.71 percent in September as 7.4
billion euros ($9.8 billion) of loans soured in the month to
take the total of doubtful credit in the banking system to 189.6
billion euros, the Bank of  Spain  said on its website today. The
 mortgage  default rate jumped to 3.49 percent in the third
quarter from 3.16 percent in the second quarter, the Bank of
Spain said.  Spain’s economic slump, now in its fifth year, continues to
drive defaults to record highs as lenders report rising
impairments of corporate, home and consumer loans as well as
those linked to real estate. Doubts about the ability of Spain’s
weaker lenders to withstand mounting impairments of loans linked
to real estate helped push the country to seek a European
bailout for its banking system in June.  “It’s clear that these levels of bad loans are going to
keep rising,” said Juan Pablo Lopez, an  analyst  at Espirito
Santo Investment Bank. “The flows of entries into default are
still very high.”  The default rate on loans to companies jumped to 16.56
percent in the third quarter from 14.9 percent in the second
quarter, the Bank of Spain said. Defaults on loans for real
estate-linked activities surged to 30.33 percent from 27.39
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
