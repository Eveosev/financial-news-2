Chile ’s peso swung between gains and
losses as optimism U.S. politicians will reach a deal in budget
negotiations offset a decline in copper.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 474.44 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in Santiago. Futures on copper, Chile’s main
export, fell 0.2 percent to $3.6575 a pound.  Stocks rose in the U.S. as President  Barack Obama  proposed
a deal to reduce tax increases for the rich that may help
lawmakers avoid $607 billion of automatic tax increases and
spending cuts due to go into effect at the start of January. The
so-called fiscal cliff risks dragging the world’s biggest
economy into a second recession in four years.  “If there’s a deal on the fiscal cliff before the end of
the year, that could drive appreciation of the peso, or if
copper goes through $3.70,” said Francisco Schneider, the head
of foreign exchange at Celfin Capital SA. “But there’s an
important support level at 473.50 per dollar, and no one really
wants to take much risk this close to the end of the year,”
said Schneider, referring to a level where orders to buy the
U.S. currency are clustered.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
reduced their bets against the peso to $6.3 billion on Dec. 13,
the lowest since May 4, according to data published today by the
central bank. Local investors had the lowest bet on the peso in
more than two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
