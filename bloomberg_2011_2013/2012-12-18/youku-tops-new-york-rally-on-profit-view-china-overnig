Chinese stocks  in  New York  rallied
to the highest level in seven months, led by  Youku Tudou Inc. (YOKU) ,
on prospects a rebound in Asia’s largest economy will drive
profit growth next year.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. climbed 1 percent to 96.75
yesterday, the highest close since May 11. Youku, a video
website owner surged 14 percent and web travel agency  Ctrip.com

by Macquarie Group Ltd. on an outlook for improved
profitability.  Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD)  jumped the most in
more than six months after Bank of America Corp. raised its
recommendation on the shares.  Equities climbed as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
forecast for growth in  China’s economy  this quarter and in 2013,
citing expansion in manufacturing. With data from retail sales
to industrial production signaling the world’s second-largest
economy may be recovering from its seven-quarter slowdown, a
Bank of America monthly survey showed more money managers than
ever say that they have a bullish outlook on China.  “We’re talking about re-balancing away from investment
into consumption,” Edmund Harriss, who oversees $300 million as
 fund manager  at Guinness Atkinson Asset Management in London,
said by phone yesterday. Growth driven by urbanization and
income growth in China “would help support  consumer spending ,
and that is where corporate profitability lies,” he said.  ETF Gains  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 0.5 percent to a nine-
month high of $39.54, bringing its advance this year to 13
percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.1 percent to
the highest level in two months as U.S. President  Barack Obama

Republican House Speaker  John Boehner .  China has set its initial target for economic growth at 7.5
percent for a second year in 2013 and tightened its inflation
goal to about 3.5 percent, the lowest level since 2010, two bank
executives and a regulatory official briefed on the matter said,
asking not to be named as they aren’t authorized to disclose the
details. Goldman projected 2013 growth of 8.2 percent, up from a
previous 8.1 percent estimate.  Forty-nine companies on the China-US gauge that reported
earnings in the last quarter missed analysts’ earnings estimates
by an average 8 percent and sales projections by 1.5 percent,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. China’s economy
expanded 7.4 percent in the third quarter, the least since the
first three months of 2009.  Video Demand  Youku Tudou, formed out of a merger between  China ’s two
largest online video websites, jumped to $19.24 in New York, the
biggest rally in nine months. Macquarie raised its rating on the
Beijing-based company to outperform, the equivalent of buy, from
underperform, and set a new price target of $21.  Demand for online video advertising has been “strong,”
and many players in the online television market are planning to
raise rates by as much as 30 percent in 2013, Jiong Shao, a Hong
Kong-based analyst at Sydney-based Macquarie, wrote in an e-
mailed note yesterday. The company will be profitable by the
second quarter of 2013, Shao wrote.  Ctrip, China’s largest online travel agency, climbed 4.7
percent to $23.11, the highest close since March. Shares of the
Shanghai-based company posted the longest stretch of gains since
May 2008. Ctrip is down 1.2 percent this year.  ‘Growth Sector’  Macquarie also lifted its rating on Ctrip to outperform
from neutral, saying China’s online travel industry will remain
“a major secular growth sector for years to come,” according
to a separate research note.  Elong Inc. (LONG) , the second-biggest online travel company in
China, jumped 5.4 percent in its fifth day of gains to $15.92.

7.5 percent to $17.94, the steepest increase since May. The
company’s ADRs have rallied for six days, cutting its decline
this year to 14 percent.  Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock’s rating to
neutral from underperform yesterday.  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the nation’s largest mobile phone
company, climbed 1.4 percent to $58.11, the highest close in
four months. Its ADRs, each representing five underlying shares,
traded 0.1 percent above its Hong Kong stock, the first  premium 
in five days.  Top Pick  Barclays Plc named the Hong Kong-based company a top pick
among telecommunications stocks in the Asia Pacific region for
2013, according to a report yesterday.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., the fourth-largest solar-
