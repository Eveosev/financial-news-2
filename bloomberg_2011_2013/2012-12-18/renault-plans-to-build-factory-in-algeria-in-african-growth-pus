Renault SA (RNO) , Europe’s third-largest
carmaker, plans to build a factory in Oran, Algeria, as part of
its push for growth in Africa.  An agreement with the Algerian government will be signed
during French President  Francois Hollande ’s visit to the North
African country this week, spokeswoman Raluca Barb said today in
a telephone interview. The factory will eventually produce as
many as 75,000 vehicles. Details will be discussed at a press
conference in Algiers tomorrow.  Renault is looking to Africa for growth, pushing rugged,
no-frills models like the Dacia Logan as its sales decline in
Europe faster than any other major carmaker. As part of the
expansion, the French manufacturer and its partner  Nissan Motor
Co. (7201)  are ramping up production at a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion)
plant in the Moroccan port city of Tangier.  The new factory in Algeria will assemble models in the same
segment as Renault's Symbol, a sedan based on the Clio compact. 
Plans for the factory were earlier reported by Le Figaro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
