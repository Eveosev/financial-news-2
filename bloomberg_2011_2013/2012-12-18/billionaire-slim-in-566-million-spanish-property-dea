Billionaire  Carlos Slim  spent 428.2
million euros ($566 million) to acquire Spanish real estate
owned by business partner  CaixaBank. (CABK)   Slim’s holding company, Inmobiliaria Carso SA, bought 439
properties, which house CaixaBank’s branches, the Barcelona-
based financial-services company said today in a  statement . The
bank will lease the spaces from Slim, it said.  The world’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg
Billionaires Index, is continuing to invest in European assets
after a regional credit crisis drove down prices. Through his
America Movil SAB, Slim has also acquired stakes this year in
Dutch phone carrier Royal KPN NV and in  Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , bets
that have yet to pay off as their stock prices have plummeted.  In Spain, Slim acquired a 3.2 percent stake in newspaper
publisher  Promotora de Informaciones SA (PRS)  last year, also through
Inmobiliaria Carso. The holding company had 0.2 percent of
CaixaBank’s shares as of August 2011, when it made its most
recent disclosure.  CaixaBank continues to hold a 20 percent stake in Slim’s
Mexican financial-services company, Grupo Financiero Inbursa
SAB. The Spanish company made the investment in 2008.  CaixaBank expects to record a pretax gain of 200 million
euros from the real-estate transaction, it said. Its shares rose
1 percent to 2.65 euros at 5:11 p.m. in Madrid.  Arturo Elias , a spokesman for Slim, didn’t immediately
return a phone message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
