Hire rates for  oil tankers  heading
to Europe from the U.S. Gulf Coast climbed to the highest in
four weeks on a shortage of vessels, according to Poten &
Partners Inc., a New York-based shipbroker and consultant.  Charter  costs  for tankers hauling 38,000 metric tons of
 diesel fuel  on the Houston-to-Amsterdam route rose 3.1 percent
to 120 industry-standard Worldscale points, the highest since
Nov. 20, data from the London-based Baltic Exchange showed
today. Refined-oil cargoes, including naphtha and gasoline,
shipped to West Africa, Brazil, and Asia curbed ship supply,
according to Jeff McGee, head of marine research and consulting
at Poten.  “An unusual flow of product cargoes thinned the list of
available ships,” McGee said by e-mail today. “It was not
really typical diesel cargoes to northwest  Europe .”  The U.S.-to-Europe voyage is referred to in the industry as
a backhaul trade because tankers carry diesel on return trips
after delivering gasoline in the opposite direction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
