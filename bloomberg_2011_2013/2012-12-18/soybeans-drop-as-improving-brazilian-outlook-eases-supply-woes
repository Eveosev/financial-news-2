Soybeans declined for a second day
as rains improved the production outlook for  Brazil , poised to
be the largest shipper this year. Corn and wheat also fell.  Rains this week in central western, southeastern and
southern regions in Brazil will maintain good soil moisture
levels, boosting crop development, Somar Meteorologia said in a
report yesterday. Some growing areas have been affected by dry
weather this season, the forecaster said. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture  expects  Brazil to produce 81 million metric tons of
soybeans in the 2012-2013 season, surpassing the U.S. as the
world’s largest  grower  and exporter.  “The weather conditions in Brazil have been improving, and
that’s helping ease supply concerns,”  Tetsu Emori , a commodity
fund manager at Astmax Co., said by phone from  Tokyo  today.
Traders also may have sold contracts after futures climbed above
$15 a bushel yesterday, a five-week high, Emori said.  Soybeans for March delivery fell 1.2 percent to $14.7075 a
bushel by 7:11 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, paring the
annual advance to 22 percent. The oilseed reached a record
$17.89 a bushel in September as U.S. drought crimped yields.  Growing areas in Brazil may have 0.5 to 1.5 inches (1.3 to
3.8 centimeters) of rain in the next 5 days, with totals in some
locations reaching 5 inches, Commodity Weather Group said today
in an e-mailed report. Rain in the next two weeks may trend
toward southern areas, the forecaster said.  Soybean planting in Brazil is 97 percent complete, compared
with 98 percent a year earlier, researcher Celeres said in a
statement yesterday, maintaining its production forecast for the
country at 79 million tons. Bumper crops in Brazil and  Argentina 
may send soybean prices in Chicago to $13.50 a bushel next year,
Fernando Lobo Pimentel, the head of Brazil’s National
Agriculture Society, said yesterday.  Wheat for delivery in March fell 0.4 percent to $8.05 a
bushel in Chicago, after climbing as much as 0.7 percent. The
grain has advanced 23 percent this year. In Paris, milling wheat
for March delivery dropped 0.7 percent to 255 euros ($336) a
ton, paring this year’s gain to 31 percent.  Corn for March delivery dropped 0.7 percent to $7.1925 a
bushel in Chicago, trimming this year’s advance to 11 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
