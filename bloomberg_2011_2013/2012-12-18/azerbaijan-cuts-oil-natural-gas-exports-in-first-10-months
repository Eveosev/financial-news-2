Azerbaijan, the biggest oil producer
in the former  Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, reduced
exports in the first 10 months of the year as output from the BP
Plc-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field declined.  The Caspian Sea nation exported 30.8 million metric tons of
crude in January through October, a decline of 8.3 percent from
the year-earlier period, the State Statistics Committee based in
the capital, Baku, said by e-mail today.  BP lowered production from the field known as ACG by 12
percent in the first half of the year. Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev  said in October “grave mistakes” by BP led to the drop
in output at the field, which provided 78 percent of the
country’s total last year.  Azerbaijan also cut natural gas exports 5.2 percent to 5.23
billion cubic meters from January to October, the State
Statistic Committee said. The country exports the fuel to
Turkey,  Georgia  and Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
