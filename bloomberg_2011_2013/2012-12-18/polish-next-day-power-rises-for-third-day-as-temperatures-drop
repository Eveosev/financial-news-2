Polish day-ahead electricity  rose
for a third day amid colder weather.  Next-day power added 1 percent to 192.53 zloty ($62.08) a
megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Temperatures in Warsaw may decline to as low as minus 5
degrees Celsius (23 Fahrenheit) tomorrow, in line with the five-
year average, CustomWeather Inc. data show.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic , Slovakia and  Hungary  dropped 0.2 percent to 53.28
euros ($70.23) a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to
the countries’ market operators.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  delayed the start of the 498-megawatt unit 4 at its
Dukovany nuclear power station by six days to Dec. 25 “because
of a missing part on a pulley during refuelling,” the Czech
utility said today.  Link to Company News:{TPE PW <Equity>
