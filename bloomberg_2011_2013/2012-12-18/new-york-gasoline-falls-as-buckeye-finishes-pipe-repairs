Gasoline weakened for the first time
in three days in New York Harbor as  Buckeye Partners LP (BPL)  resumed
normal operations on its 620 pipeline following repairs.  Line 620, which carries about 140,000 barrels a day of
refined products from Linden,  New Jersey , to Macungie,
Pennsylvania, shut Dec. 11 after some 25 gallons of gasoline
leaked near Hillsborough, New Jersey. Buckeye said today it
installed a temporary repair sleeve along the affected section
of the line and plans to make permanent repairs later.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in New York Harbor weakened 0.75 cent to 1.75 cents a gallon
above futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
12:16 p.m.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region was unchanged
at a premium of 7.13 cents to heating oil futures.  Stockpiles of motor fuel in the U.S. are forecast to gain 2
million barrels for the week ended Dec. 14, according to the
median estimate of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly inventory
report tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
