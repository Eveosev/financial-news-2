Chateau d’Yquem, the luxury
winemaker owned by  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , canceled
its 2012 Sauternes sweet wine vintage after the grapes failed to
rot correctly following an abundance of rain.  The weather prevented the grapes from developing the
flavor, complexity and juice concentration needed to meet the
chateau’s standards, Jon Elsen, an LVMH spokesman who works for
Kekst & Co. in New York, said in an interview. Pierre Lurton,
the winemaker’s chief executive officer, declared that the
vintage would be canceled, Elsen said.  The Sauternes sweet white wine derives its flavor from
grapes picked after a fungus, referred to as noble rot, sets in
and boosts their sugar content, according to the winery’s
website.  “It’s a good sign for the consumer to know that somebody
is willing to forgo a year’s worth of revenues,”  John Kapon ,
New York-based chief executive officer of wine auction company
 Acker Merrall & Condit , said today in an interview. “Then
again, every producer is not owned by LVMH, so that probably
helps.”  The missing vintage, which was reported earlier by Agence
France-Presse, is unlikely to raise prices for the wine’s
existing and coming vintages, Kapon said.  The missed year will cost $33 million in lost sales that
would have come from about 100,000 bottles, AFP said. The winery
also skipped production in 1992, 1974, 1972, 1964 and 1952,
Elsen said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
