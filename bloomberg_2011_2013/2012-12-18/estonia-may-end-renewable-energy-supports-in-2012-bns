Estonia’s parliament may end
subsidies for renewable-energy producers from 2021 to simplify
the aid system, Kaja Kallas, the head of the parliament’s
economic affairs’ committee, told  Baltic News Service .  Setting an end-date “is clearer to everyone” than the
government-proposed option which would require the Cabinet to
annually establish a minimum amount of renewable energy eligible
for subsidies, Kallas told BNS late yesterday in an interview.
The parliament is due to continue the first of three readings of
the bill next month.  The government in October submitted to parliament a draft
bill reducing subsidies to green energy producers by 15 percent
to 20 percent to cushion the effect of higher electricity prices
on consumers.  The changes can be implemented after Estonia gets clearance
for state aid from the European Commission, Kallas said last
month. An initial plan had called for cutting the subsidies from
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
