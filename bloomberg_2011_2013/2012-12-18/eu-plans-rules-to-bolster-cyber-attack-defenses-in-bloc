European Union regulators plan
guidelines for how governments should bolster defenses from
Internet-based attacks, the European Commission said today.  The Brussels-based commission “will deliver a strategy and
proposed directive to establish a common minimum level of
preparedness at national level, including an online platform to
prevent and counter cross-border cyber incidents, and incident
reporting requirements,” the agency said in a statement on its
priorities for the digital industry in 2013 and 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
