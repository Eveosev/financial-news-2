Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , a U.K.-based oil and
gas engineer, forecast a 7.4 percent increase in its order
backlog this year as customers in the  Middle East  and former
Soviet Union seek to expand production.  The backlog will reach $11.6 billion by Dec. 31, up from
$10.8 billion a year earlier, Edinburgh-based Petrofac said
today in a statement. Net income will grow at least 15 percent
in the period, the company said.  Petrofac clients in the Mideast and former Soviet nations,
mainly national  oil companies , are extending the search for
crude to bolster state revenues as global growth wanes. That
benefits Petrofac at a time when demand is weakening in the
U.S., prompting competitor  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  to issue a profit
warning this month as the shale-gas boom slows.  “We are well-positioned to grow next year and beyond, and
we are confident of achieving our target of more than doubling
our recurring 2010 group earnings by 2015,” Petrofac Chief
Executive Officer Ayman Asfari said in the statement.  Petrofac declined 1.1 percent to 1,661 pence at the close
in London trading, valuing the company at 5.75 billion pounds
($9 billion).  “Looking at the geographies of where we operate in, in the
Middle East and the former Soviet Union, analysts expect
spending from our customers to grow by 10 to 15 percent” in
2013, Chief Financial Officer Tim Weller said today on a
conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
