optimism the central bank will ease policy after the election,
and on signs U.S. budget talks are progressing.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  soared 17 percent, capping its

high as concern about its debts eased.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s

President  Barack Obama  and House Speaker  John Boehner  appeared
to make progress during budget talks, according to a person
familiar with the matter. The broader  Topix Index (TPX)  advanced 1.1
percent to 816.85 today before the Bank of  Japan  starts a
meeting tomorrow with incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
pressing for more monetary easing.  “There’s a chance that they’ll come to a conclusion about
the U.S. fiscal cliff before Christmas,” said  Fumiyuki
Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities
Co. “Because of policy talks between the LDP and the Bank of
Japan as well as news of the inclusion of a large extra budget,
the market expectations for the new government are likely to
last more than a day.”  Nikkei Surge  The Nikkei 225 has surged 17 percent this year, poised to
reverse two years of losses, as the  Bank of Japan  joined central
banks around the world to spur economic growth and on signs of
recovery in the U.S. and  China .  The Topix, which has gained 12 percent this year, trades at
0.967 times book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than the value of their assets.  Futures on the  S&P 500  advanced 0.2 percent today. The
gauge surged 1.2 percent to a two-month high yesterday. Obama
offered a budget compromise that would increase tax rates for
households earning more than $400,000 a year, up from his
earlier proposal to raise taxes on those earning more than
$250,000, said a person familiar with the talks.  Budget Offer  In exchange, Obama asked for authority to increase the U.S.
debt limit for two years without congressional approval. The
president is negotiating with Republican lawmakers to avert the
so-called fiscal cliff, more than $600 billion in tax increases
and spending cuts set to start in January.  Tokyo Electric  soared 17 percent to 237 yen. The stock,
which lost more than 90 percent of its value after the meltdown
at its Fukushima plant in March 2011, has jumped 55 percent in

13, after rising as much as 24 percent. The TV maker that warned
in November about its survival reached an agreement this month

San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. after failing to secure investment
from Foxconn Technology Group.  Exporters advanced as the yen traded near its lowest
against the dollar since April 2011 on optimism the new
government will press for aggressive easing and a doubling of
the nation’s inflation goal. A weaker yen boosts overseas
earnings at Japanese companies.  Canon climbed 3.3 percent to 3,245 yen. Honda Motor Co.
rose 1.8 percent to 2,892 yen.  Softbank Financing  Softbank rose 4.8 percent to 3,130 yen. The mobile carrier
