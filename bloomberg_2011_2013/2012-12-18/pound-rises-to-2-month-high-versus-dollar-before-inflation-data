U.K. 10-year bonds fell for an
eighth day before a government report that economists said will
show consumer-price inflation remained at the fastest since May,
weakening the case for more central bank asset purchases.  Benchmark  yields  climbed to the highest level since October.
 Consumer prices  rose 2.7 percent last month from a year earlier,
matching the October reading, according to the median estimate
of 34 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank of England  policy
makers are due to release the minutes of their December meeting
tomorrow. The pound rose to an 11-week high versus the dollar.  The 10-year yield climbed two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.91 percent at 8:56 a.m. in  London  after
rising to 1.92 percent, the highest since Oct. 25. The 1.75
percent bond due in September 2022 dropped 0.18, or 1.80 pounds
per 1,000-pound ($1,621) face amount, to 98.58.  U.K. gilts handed investors a loss of 1.1 percent this
month through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German bonds gained 0.2 percent and Treasuries
declined 0.6 percent.  The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.6214 after rising to
$1.6218, the strongest level since Sept. 28. Sterling was little
changed at 81.21 pence per euro.  The pound has strengthened 1.6 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 1.4 percent and
the dollar fell 3.2 percent.  Bank of England officials kept the central bankâ€™s asset-
purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds and the key  interest rate 
at a record low of 0.5 percent at their Dec. 6 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
