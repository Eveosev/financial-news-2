Suntory Holdings Ltd., the closely
held Japanese whiskey and beer maker, is planning an initial
public offering of its non-alcoholic beverage unit in  Tokyo  and
will set up a division within the subsidiary to explore deals.  The company will list Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, it said in an e-mailed statement today,
without providing a time frame or size of the offering. The unit
will set up a department for mergers and acquisitions starting
Jan. 1, according to the statement.  Suntory, along with rivals  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503)  and  Asahi
Group Holdings Ltd. (2502) , has sought growth overseas as a declining
population damps domestic demand. The Osaka-based company has
focused overseas acquisitions on non-alcohol beverages in the
past five years, buying Orangina Schweppes Group of  France  and
 New Zealand ’s Frucor Beverages Group Ltd. in 2009.  The subsidiary aims to have sales of 2 trillion yen ($24
billion) by 2020, according to today’s statement. The unit had
970.6 billion yen in sales for the year ended December 2011,
while parent Suntory Holdings generated 1.8 trillion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
