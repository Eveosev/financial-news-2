Polish 2-year bond yields held near
record lows as a report showed the employment rate fell in
November, boosting the case for more interest-rate cuts.  The yield on notes maturing in July 2014 was unchanged at
3.30 percent as of 6:06 p.m. in Warsaw after falling to as low
as 3.20 percent last week. The zloty gained less than 0.1
percent to 4.0879 against the euro.  The country’s  employment  rate fell 0.3 percent from a year
earlier last month, the first decline since March 2010, the
statistics office said today. The report may be followed by
industrial production and core inflation data this week that may
point to a deepening economic slowdown, according to Citigroup
Inc. The central bank cut  interest rates  for a second month in
December and Governor  Marek Belka  said policy makers “can’t
afford” a pause in monetary easing.  “The labor market data is a negative surprise,”  Piotr
Kalisz , chief economist at Citigroup’s unit in Warsaw, wrote in
an e-mailed note to clients. “This practically means that the
central bank may continue to ease the monetary policy.”  Investors in interest rate derivatives predict the central
bank will reduce the main rate by another 1.13 percentage point
in the next 12 months, according to a gap between Warsaw
Interbank Offered Rate and forward rate agreements.  Returns on Polish domestic bonds this year was 24 percent
in euro terms, the fifth-biggest gain among 26 countries tracked
by Bloomberg and European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
