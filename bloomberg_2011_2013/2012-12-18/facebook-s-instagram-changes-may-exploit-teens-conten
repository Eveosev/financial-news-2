Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s Instagram policy
changes, announced yesterday, may let advertisers use teenagers’
photos for marketing, raising privacy and security concerns,
said  Jeffrey Chester ,  executive director  for the Center for
Digital Democracy.  The new policies, which now apply to users as young as 13,
enable Instagram, a photo-sharing service that Facebook bought
in August, to use members’ names, text, photos and other content
with marketing messages, the company said on its  site . The new
terms of use, set to take effect next month, could be
exploitative, Chester said.  Facebook, operator of the world’s largest social network
with more than 1 billion users, is changing policies for its
Instagram unit as it looks for ways to increase revenue across
its services. Instagram, popular with teens and young adults,
reached more than 100 million users, Facebook Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  said in September.  Facebook “sees teens as a digital goldmine,” said
Chester, whose group is focused on privacy issues. “We will be
pressing the Federal Trade Commission to issue policies to
protect teen privacy.”  If users are younger than 18, then they “represent” that
at least one parent or guardian has also agreed to content being
used in marketing, according to the updated usage terms. The
changes are aimed at protecting members while preventing abuse,
Instagram said in a  blog .  In the updated policy document, Instagram also said it may
not always identify paid services or sponsored content. The
company said it doesn’t claim ownership of any content on the
service, though some businesses may pay to display users’ names,
likeness or photos in connection with sponsored content.  “Our updated privacy policy helps Instagram function more
easily as part of Facebook by being able to share info between
the two groups,” the company said. “This means we can do
things like fight spam more effectively, detect system and
reliability problems more quickly, and build better features for
everyone by understanding how Instagram is used.”  Facebook rose 3.6 percent to $27.71 at the close in  New
York . The stock has lost 27 percent since an initial public
offering in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
