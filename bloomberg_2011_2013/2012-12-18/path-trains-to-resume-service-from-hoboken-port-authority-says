PATH trains between Hoboken and the
33rd Street station in Manhattan will resume tomorrow following
almost two months of repairs of water damage from  Hurricane
Sandy , the  Port Authority  of New York and New Jersey said.  Resumption of direct service between Hoboken and the World
Trade Center remains several weeks away because damaged signal
equipment needs to be replaced, the Port Authority said.  Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 29 decimated the PATH system,
flooding the tunnels with as much as 8 feet (2.4 meters) of
water and destroying critical signal and switching systems, the
Port Authority said.  Trains will initially run in both directions from 5 a.m.
until 10 p.m. seven days a week, the agency said. PATH expects
to provide limited 24-hour service from Hoboken to 33rd Street by
year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
