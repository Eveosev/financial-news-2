Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) 
failed to meet certain requirements with equipment it is using
to test repairs for  Edison International (EIX) ’s shuttered San Onofre
nuclear power plant, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said
in a report posted on its website.  NRC inspectors found that Mitsubishi, which built the steam
generators for San Onofre, failed to properly verify tubes in a
model being used to test potential fixes to damaged steam
generators, the NRC said.  San Onofre, located about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of
Los Angeles, has been shut since January after NRC inspectors
found unusual tube wear in steam generators made by Mitsubishi.
The NRC is reviewing Edison’s plans to restart its Unit 2
reactor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
