Natural gas futures advanced for a
second day in New York on forecasts for colder-than-normal
weather that would boost demand for the heating fuel.  Gas advanced as much as 2.3 percent after Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted below-average
temperatures in parts of the Midwest from Dec. 23 through Dec.
27, followed by cooler weather in most of the lower 48 states
the next week. Earlier outlooks showed mostly higher or higher-
than-normal temperatures through Dec. 27.  “The weather forecast has shifted quite a bit colder and
that’s what has given the market a boost,” said Bob Yawger,
director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
in New York. “It’s a pretty significant change in the
temperature outlook.”  Natural gas for January delivery rose 5.4 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $3.412 per million British thermal units at 9:28
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures are up 14
percent this year, heading for the first annual gain since 2007.  The low in  Chicago  on Dec. 31 may be 15 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 9 Celsius), 4 below than the usual reading, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,  Pennsylvania . The low in New
York may be 25 degrees, 3 lower than normal.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
Energy Department data show.  Inventory Outlook  A department report scheduled for release Dec. 20 will show
gas inventories fell by 57 billion cubic feet last week to 3.749
trillion, according to Donald Murry, an economist at C.H.
Guernsey & Co. in Oklahoma City.  The five-year average
withdrawal for the period is 144 billion.  Stockpiles rose 2 billion cubic feet in the week ended Dec.
7 to 3.806 trillion cubic feet, a government report showed Dec.
13. It was the latest seasonal supply gain since Dec. 30, 2005,
according to department data compiled by Bloomberg.  Supplies were 8 percent above the five-year average,
compared with 4.6 percent the previous week. The gas inventory
 surplus  to the average has declined from a six-year high of 61
percent in March, department data show.  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas output in 2012
by 0.6 percent in a report Dec. 11 and boosted its outlook for
prices.  Marketed gas production will average 69.22 billion cubic
feet a day this year, up from 68.84 billion estimated in
November, the Energy Department said in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook . Output may rise 0.5 percent in 2013 to 69.59
billion a day, department estimates show.  Hub Prices  Gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $2.78 per million British thermal units, compared
with the previous estimate of $2.77, according to the report
from the department’s Energy Information Administration.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first eight months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. slipped by
one to 416 last week, according to data from  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) 
in Houston. The rig count is down 49 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
