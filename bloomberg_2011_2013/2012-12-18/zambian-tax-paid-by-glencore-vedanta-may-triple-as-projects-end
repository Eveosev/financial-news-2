Mining companies such as  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  will pay three times
more tax in Zambia than they did in 2010 once they finish
expansion projects in  Africa ’s biggest copper producer, the
 Chamber of Mines  said.  “With a little bit of patience from the government and tax
collectors, in the next couple of years there is going to be a
very rapid ramping up of taxation,” Fredrick Bantubonse, the
general manager of the chamber, said in a Dec. 17 interview in
Lusaka, the capital. “I can see it quite easily reaching $1.5
billion.”  Zambia plans to introduce stricter laws that will apply to
companies including  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  and  First Quantum Ltd. (FM) ,
Deputy Finance Minister Miles Sampa said last month. The
country’s laws allow mining companies, which paid $500 million
in dues in 2010, to deduct  capital investment  from tax, curbing
the government’s revenue from the industry, Bantubonse said.  The country is losing as much as $2 billion annually
because of corporate  tax avoidance , Sampa said.  “Even if you put the taxation at 40 percent, it would
require a profit of $5 billion” to justify tax of $2 billion,
Bantubonse said. “You cannot make $5 billion profit on $6
billion of exports.” Sampa’s estimates are “unbelievable,” he
said.  Zambia produced about 700,000 metric tons of copper in
2010, generating roughly $6 billion in sales, Bantubonse said.
The metal declined for a fifth day, losing 1.3 percent to
$7,919.50 a ton on the London Metals Exchange by 3:01 p.m. in
 London .  Tax Payments  About $8.8 billion left Zambia in  illicit financial flows 
from 2001 and 2010, Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-
based research company, said Dec. 13, citing its own research.  Mopani Copper Mines has paid $425.1 million in taxes and
royalties to Zambia since Glencore bought 73.1 percent of the
operation in 2000, the world’s largest commodity trader said in
an April  submission  to a parliamentary committee in the U.K. In
2011, it paid $104 million, and Mopani will have an effective
tax rate of 52 percent in 2012, Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore
said.  First Quantum paid $224 million in Zambian taxes in June
last year and $80 million in 2010, according to its 2011 annual
report. Its effective  tax rate  at the flagship Kansanshi mine is
43 percent, the Vancouver-based company said.  “There is no real benefit if you are going to avoid tax,”
said Jeyakumar Janakaraj, chief executive officer of Konkola
Copper Mines, in which London-based Vedanta has a 79.4 percent
stake. “It’s not a long-term strategy for anybody,” he said in
a Nov. 30 interview in Livingstone, near the Victoria Falls in
the southwest of the country.  Audit Co-operation  If the Zambian government believes mining companies are not
paying the correct amount of tax, it should undertake an audit,
Bantubonse said. The industry in November 2011 volunteered to
co-operate in such an inquiry, he said.  “People become very sensational when it comes to copper,”
he said. “It is very emotional. When you sit down with a cool
mind and try to reason about it, then you find fault in those
figures.”  Zambia plans to cut the capital expenditure deduction rate
for mining companies to 25 percent from 100 percent, Finance
Minister Alexander Chikwanda in his Oct. 12 budget speech.
Companies would only be able to claim for deductions once the
asset is brought into production, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
