City Service AB (CTS1L) , the biggest Baltic
building maintenance company, rose to a three-month high after
completing the purchase of a Polish company to start expanding
into central  Europe .  The shares rose as much as 2.7 percent and traded up 2.2
percent at 1.89 euros at 12:33 p.m. in Vilnius, the highest
since Aug. 30, valuing the company at 59.7 million euros ($79
million). Volume of 12,801 shares was equivalent to 220 percent
of the three-month average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  City Service, which operates in Lithuania, Latvia, Russia
and Ukraine, paid 45 million zloty ($15 million) for state-owned
facility manager Zespol Zarzadcow Nieruchomosci WAM Sp. z o.o.,
the Vilnius-based company said in a regulatory statement today.
That gives it 3.4 percent of  Poland ’s residential facility
management market and creates opportunities for further
expansion, it said.  “The transaction value seems to be quite low and came
below our expectations,” Tadas Povilauskas, a Vilnius-based
analyst at investment bank Finasta, said in a note today. “We
positively treat such a purchase and believe it will be value
added to the share price of City Service.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
