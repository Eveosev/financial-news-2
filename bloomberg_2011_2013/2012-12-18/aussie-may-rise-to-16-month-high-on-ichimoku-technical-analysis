The Australian dollar may extend its
gain this year against the U.S. currency toward a 16-month high,
according to Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd., which cited
trading patterns.  The so-called Aussie may rise to $1.10 should it break
above $1.06, a key resistance area, according to Takuya Kawabata, a researcher in  Tokyo  at Gaitame.com. The higher level
was last reached in August 2011.  “The Australian dollar has been supported above the
convergence line on the daily Ichimoku chart since late November
and is looking to test higher,” said Gaitame’s Kawabata. The
Aussie last rose above $1.06 on Aug. 9, forming a long upper
shadow, he said, referring to a formation on the candle chart
which displays a currency’s high, low, open and close for each
day.  The Australian dollar was at $1.0539 as of 4:27 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0552 yesterday. It touched $1.0586 on Dec. 12,
the highest since Sept. 14. The Aussie has gained 3.2 percent
this year.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows.
Resistance refers to an area on the chart where analysts
anticipate orders to sell an asset may be clustered, whereas
support refers to an area where there may be a concentration of
buy orders.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
