U.K. natural gas for same-day
delivery rose for the first time in four days as the network
manager forecast demand for the heating fuel would be above
normal levels.  Within-day gas  gained as much as 1 percent, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Demand in the 24 hours to 6
a.m. tomorrow will be 304 million cubic meters versus a seasonal
normal of 297 million,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Gas for today climbed 0.65 pence, or 1 percent, to 66 pence
a therm at 5:20 p.m. London time.  Month-ahead gas  advanced 0.7
percent to 66.96 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.89 per
million British thermal units and compares with $3.41 per
million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Gas accounted for 37 percent of U.K. power production at
5:15 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 39 percent, nuclear 14
percent and wind 0.8 percent.  Electricity for the next working day fell 3.5 percent to 49
pounds a megawatt-hour, erasing most of yesterday’s advance,
broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
