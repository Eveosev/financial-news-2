Home Secretary Theresa May said the
U.K. government is examining ways to reclaim some of the legal
costs it has incurred as a radical Islamic cleric,  Abu Qatada ,
fights deportation to Jordan on terrorism-related charges.  A special immigration appeal court in London ruled Last
month that Qatada, who is accused of links to al-Qaeda, can’t be
deported because it couldn’t be sure that evidence against him
was not obtained through torture. The U.K. government is still
working on efforts to deport him.  The Ministry of Justice said on Dec. 5 the U.K. has paid
515,778 pounds ($839,000) in legal aid so far to Hamza’s
lawyers. Opposition Labour lawmaker Keith Vaz, who is chairman
of Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee, asked May today if
Qatada’s seized assets, valued at 217,000 pounds, could be used
to offset that cost.  “There has been some ability to defray against what has
been seized,” May told Vaz’s panel at a hearing. “This is an
area where I have asked my officials to look at the processes
and the legislation around this area, not just because of this
case but because of other cases as well where this is an issue
in criminal cases as well as terrorism cases.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
