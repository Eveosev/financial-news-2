Asia ’s gasoil crack spread shrank,
signaling reduced profits for refiners making diesel.  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  sold a naphtha timespread for a third day in
Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude dropped 50
cents to $19.18 a barrel at 2:38 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack
spread , a measure of processing profit, is the narrowest so far
this month.  Trafigura Beheer BV bought 150,000 barrels of  gasoil  with
0.5 percent sulfur for a second day in Singapore, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of traders who monitored transactions on
the Platts window. The Amsterdam-based trader paid 10 cents a
barrel less than average December prices to Royal Dutch Shell
Plc to load from Jan. 11 to Jan. 15.  Jet fuel  was unchanged after rising to a  premium  of 25
cents a barrel to gasoil, PVM said. A positive regrade signals
it is more profitable to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  BP Plc sold 100,000 barrels of  jet fuel  to PetroChina Co.
for Jan. 3 to Jan. 7 loading, the survey showed. The cargo
changed hands at 10 cents a barrel more than prices for Jan. 2
to Jan. 8. Hin Leong Trading Pte sold 245,000 barrels to China
Aviation Oil Singapore Corp. for Jan. 6 to Jan. 10 loading at
parity to average January prices.  Light Distillates  Glencore sold 25,000 metric tons of open-specification
naphtha to Trafigura for second-half February delivery and
bought a first-half March shipment, according to the Bloomberg
survey. The half-month difference traded at $7.50 a ton.
Glencore has sold naphtha timespreads at least 13 times so far
this month.  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell 34 cents to $116.70 a ton at 5:28 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The difference is
also known as the crack spread.  PetroChina bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline for a
second day, paying $115.40 a barrel to Gracewood International
Ltd. to load from Jan. 6 to Jan. 10, the survey showed.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil ’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 9 cents to $7.39
a barrel at 2:38 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. This
crack spread widened for a second day, indicating increased
losses for refiners making residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged after advancing to
$10.25 a ton, PVM data showed. This means bunker, or marine
fuel, moved in tandem with supplies used in power stations.  Refinery News  Essar Oil Ltd. may halt diesel exports from its 400,000
barrel-a-day refinery on  India ’s west coast by 2016 to meet
domestic demand, Chief Executive Officer L.K. Gupta said in an
interview in  New Delhi .  Tenders  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. closed offers to sell 720,000
barrels of gasoil with 500 parts-per-million of sulfur and
300,000 barrels with 10 parts-per-million for January loading
from Mailiao, according to an official who asked not be named
because of company policy.  Essar offered to sell as much as 70,000 tons of gasoil with
500 parts-per-million of sulfur for January loading from
Vadinar, said two traders who asked not to be identified because
the information is confidential.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. offered to sell 35,000 tons of
naphtha for January loading from Hazira, according to a tender
document e-mailed to potential buyers.  Korea East-West Power Co. is seeking to buy two fuel oil
