Tin consumption and output in  China ,
the biggest user, will rebound next year after an economic
slowdown lowered demand and kept smelters reluctant to produce,
according to industry group ITRI Ltd.  Consumption will gain 4 percent to 152,000 metric tons in
2013 after falling 5 percent this year, Cui Lin, chief
representative in China, said from Beijing yesterday. The
country used a record 154,000 tons in 2011. Output will match
the all-time high in 2011 at about 160,000 tons after dipping to
152,000 tons this year, she said.  Tin has jumped 22 percent this year, the best performer
among six metals on the  London  Metal Exchange. Rising demand in
China, coupled with supply constraints from the largest exporter
 Indonesia , should bolster prices and draw down Chinese
inventories. China accounts for about 43 percent of global usage
of the metal used to make cans and electronics, according to  St.
Albans , England-based ITRI.  “Tin has a big chance to perform better next year,” said
Wu Xiaofeng, an analyst at data provider SMM Information &
Technology Co. “Improving demand from China is likely to play a
major role in supporting prices.”  Tin for delivery in three months on the LME climbed as much
as 0.6 percent to $23,450 a ton, the highest level in eight
months. The consumption estimate for this year is lower than
ITRI and CRU International Ltd.’s 147,900-ton forecast in August.  Consumption Outlook  Tin chemical was the only product that witnessed growth
this year, as demand from soldering and tinplate declined,
leading to the biggest yearly drop in China’s tin consumption
since 2008, Cui said, citing the company’s survey findings. The
country’s  gross domestic product  gained 7.4 percent in the third
quarter, the slowest since the first quarter of 2009.  Tin chemical is likely to have strong growth potential,
while tinplate use may expand along with China’s focus on
domestic consumption, according to Cui.  “A slowdown in the electronics industry and the trend of
electronic miniaturization will curb demand in this sector,”
she said. “Soldering demand may slow to 4 to 5 percent growth a
year from over 10 percent in the past.”  Soldering accounted for about 65 percent of China’s total
usage last year, while tin chemical and tinplate were at 15
percent and 10 percent, according to ITRI.  Stockpiles Expand  A drop in demand has led to an increase of Chinese
inventories by 17,000 tons, the biggest advance in at least a
decade, ITRI’s calculations showed. Imports of unwrought  tin 
jumped 65 percent from a year ago to 26,273 tons in the first 10
months, with shipments from Indonesia accounting for 49 percent,
according to China’s customs department.  “Plenty of arbitrage opportunities fueled the imports,”
Cui said. “Next year, as demand rebounds and supplies from
Indonesia are curbed, we expect domestic inventories to fall.”
Arbitrage traders make profits by buying the metal in London and
selling in Shanghai.  Indonesia banned exports of some mineral ores starting in
May, except for mining business license holders that plan to
build local processing plants. Those shipments are subject to a
20 percent tax, according to government regulations.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
