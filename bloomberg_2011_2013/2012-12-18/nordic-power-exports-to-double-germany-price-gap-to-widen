Nordic power’s discount to German
prices will widen as increasing renewable energy and nuclear
output boost the region’s power glut, triggering higher exports,
SKM Market Predictor AS said.  Nordic power prices for baseload delivery are likely to
average about 46 euros ($60) a megawatt-hour from 2018 through
2022, about 6 euros less than comparable German prices, the
Trondheim, Norway-based power analysts said today in a  report 
commissioned by  Finland ’s Economy Ministry. That differential
may double in 2023-2027, SKM’s figures show.  Renewable energy expansion and nuclear capacity upgrades
are likely to contribute to an increase in future oversupply in
Nordic electricity, according to SKM.  Germany , meanwhile, is
replacing 17 nuclear reactors that supplied about a fifth of its
power with new solar, wind and coal capacity following the 2011
nuclear disaster in Fukushima,  Japan .  “The price spread between the regions will grow,
compounding the need for exports from north to south, especially
after Germany phases out nuclear reactors in 2022,” Juha
Turkki, senior analyst at SKM Market Predictor said today by
phone from Helsinki. “The Nordic region will ship out
increasing power volumes, mainly to Germany.”  Export Surge  Nordic power exports may total 9.7 terawatt-hours in 2015,
or 2.4 percent of the region’s power output, and rise to 21.7
terawatt-hours in 2020 and 42.9 terawatt-hours by 2025,
according to the study.  The  Nordic countries  will add 20 terawatt-hours of nuclear
output by 2020 from Finland’s 1,600-megawatt Olkiluoto-3 nuclear
unit and capacity upgrades at  Sweden ’s 10 reactors. Production
from wind and solar is poised to more than double from 12.5
terawatt-hours in 2010 to 28.8 terawatt-hours by 2015, and
further to 48 terawatt-hours by 2020, SKM said.  Planned nuclear reactors will help cut Finland’s dependence
on imports, resulting in net annual exports by 2025, Turkki
wrote in the report. Three new nuclear plants and growing wind
power penetration may see annual Finnish power supply increase
by 40 terawatt-hours through 2025 from last year’s 70 terawatt-
hours, ridding the country of its need to buy 16 percent of
electricity from abroad, the analysts wrote.  Finland imported as much as 13.9 terawatt-hours last year,
of which 78 percent from  Russia , according to data from the
country’s Energy Industries association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
