Former South African President
Nelson Mandela will remain in hospital as long as possible to
make a complete recovery from surgery, President Jacob Zuma’s
office said.  Mandela, 94, is recovering after being treated for
gallstones that were removed on Dec. 15, the Presidency said in
an e-mailed statement today. Mandela was admitted to a hospital
in  Pretoria , the capital, on Dec. 8 for tests, which revealed he
had a recurring lung infection.  “Doctors are satisfied that the progress he is making is
consistent with his age,” the  Presidency  said.  “They say
there is no crisis, but add that they are in no hurry to send
him home just yet until they are satisfied that he has made
sufficient progress.”  Mandela became South Africa’s first black president after
the African National Congress won all-race elections in 1994
that ended apartheid. He spent 27 years in prison before that
for his opposition to white-minority rule. This is the second
time he has been hospitalized this year after undergoing
exploratory abdominal surgery in February. Last year, Mandela
received treatment for an acute respiratory infection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
