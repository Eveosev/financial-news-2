The U.K. set solar incentives under
its renewables support program at higher rates than it proposed
in September, while placing a cap on biomass.  Solar plants mounted on buildings from April 2013 will get
1.7 Renewable Obligation Certificates per megawatt-hour of
electricity generated, while those placed in ground arrays will
get 1.6 ROCs, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said
today in a  statement . That compares with the 1.5 originally
proposed.  The renewables program, which will close to new  power
plants  in 2017, compels generators to derive a proportion of
their electricity from clean sources. At present it’s the
government’s main tool to meet a European Union target of
obtaining 15 percent of all energy from renewables by 2020.  The government also said it’ll place a non-binding cap of
400 megawatts on new dedicated biomass plants. New plants will
get 1.5 ROCs per megawatt-hour from next year, and 1.4 ROCs in
2016. Once the cap is reached, the government said it will
consider holding a consultation on proposals to restrict further
biomass deployment.  The number of ROCs awarded for new solar panels on
buildings will decline by 0.1 per year through 2017, the energy
department said. Solar panels mounted in arrays on the ground
will get 1.6 ROCs next year, declining to 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2 in
subsequent years, according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
