Iraq’s President Jalal Talabani, the
country’s first Kurdish head of state who has maintained close
relations with the Arab nation’s rival factions, was
hospitalized in Baghdad due to “exhaustion,” his office said.  “Talabani has lately exerted intensive efforts to achieve
reconciliation and stability in the country,” according to a
statement from the president’s office on his website. “Due to
exhaustion and fatigue, His Excellency had a health complication
after which he was taken to hospital late Monday.”  Media including  CNN , the British Broadcasting Corp. and the
 Associated Press  reported that Talabani, 79, suffered a stroke.
He has been president since 2005, when he became the first
democratically elected head of state in 50 years after a U.S.-
led military invasion ousted the regime of  Saddam Hussein .  Talabani began his political career in the 1950s and
founded the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in 1975. His Peshmerga
militia battled Hussein’s army in the 1970s and 1980s and
following the 1991 U.S.-led invasion, he led a Kurdish uprising
against the Iraqi government.  The statement didn’t provide details about Talabani’s
condition.  Iraq sits on the world’s fifth-biggest crude reserves,
according to  BP Plc (BP/)  statistics that include Canada’s oil sands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
