Morocco ’s central bank left its
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3 percent, saying “the
balance of risks is neutral and the central inflation forecast
is permanently consistent with the price-stability objective.”  Mohamed Abu Basha, an economist at Cairo-based EFG-Hermes
Holding SAE, said he had expected rates to remain on hold. “The
economic environment remains weak given the linkages to  Europe 
and fiscal consolidation,” he said in an e-mail before the
central bank announcement.  Morocco’s economy, which expanded at its slowest pace since
2007 in the second quarter, will bounce back in 2013 as
agriculture recovers from a drought last year, Abu Basha said.
Farming output fell 9.6 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier, according to the statistics agency. Along with
tourism, agriculture accounts for about 23 percent of the
economy.  “The trade deficit widened by 11.8 percent to the end of
November, while transfers of Moroccans living abroad and travel
receipts shrank by 4 percent and 2.3 percent respectively,” the
Rabat-based bank said in a statement posted on its website.
“Revenues under foreign direct investment to the end of October
rose 7.8 percent year-on-year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
