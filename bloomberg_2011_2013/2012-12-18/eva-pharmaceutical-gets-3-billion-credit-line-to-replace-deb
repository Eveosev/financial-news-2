Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ,
the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, got a $3 billion
revolving credit line to replace a smaller loan.  Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Bank Plc arranged the five-year
revolver replacing a $2.5 billion financing pact, the Petach
Tikva, Israel-based company said today in a statement
distributed by  Business Wire .  “We took another step on our recently announced new
strategy and secured ample liquidity to support Teva’s future
 growth ,” Eyal Desheh, Teva’s chief financial officer, said in
the statement.  Teva, which generated $18.3 billion of revenue last year,
will focus on developing drugs for respiratory and central
nervous system illnesses as it seeks to replace medicines set to
lose patent protection in the next three years, the company told
investors in a Dec. 11 briefing.  Teva last week dropped the most in 16 months in  New York  on
concern the drugmaker’s strategy under new Chief Executive
Officer Jeremy Levin won’t be enough to sustain profit growth.
The company’s  American depositary receipts  rose 27 cents to
$38.66 at 12:45 p.m. in New York.  Earlier this month, the company sold $2 billion of dollar-
denominated bonds for general corporate purposes.  Money under a revolving  credit line  can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
