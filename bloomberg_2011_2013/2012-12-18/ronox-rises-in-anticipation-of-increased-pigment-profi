Tronox Inc. (TROX) , the largest integrated
maker of titanium dioxide, had its biggest two-day gain in 14
months as investors anticipate profit from the white pigment
used in paint and plastics will rebound in 2013.  Tronox, based in Stamford,  Connecticut , rose 9.8 percent to
$19.08 at the close in  New York . The shares have gained 21
percent this week, the biggest two-day increase since Oct. 7,
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Excess inventories of titanium dioxide are being worked
down, aided by a U.S. housing recovery and faster economic
growth in  China , and profit should start to recover from the
decline in the second quarter, said Edward P. Mally, an analyst
at Imperial Capital LLC.  “The conditions are set up to support a recovery in Tronox
earnings and potential growth in 2013,” Mally, who rates the
shares outperform, the equivalent of a buy rating, said by phone
today. “The stock had gotten oversold in the face of
uncertainty in their outlook.”  Tronox got a boost from a Dec. 15 report in Barron’s that
highlighted signs of a potential recovery in the pigment, known
by its chemical formula TiO2, Mally said. The story said Tronox
shares may double in the next year.  The company in November reported “weak” TiO2 demand and
said sales should begin to increase in 2013.  Tronox in June acquired controlling interests in  Exxaro
Resources Ltd. (EXX) ’s mineral-sands operations to become the world’s
biggest integrated maker of titanium dioxide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
