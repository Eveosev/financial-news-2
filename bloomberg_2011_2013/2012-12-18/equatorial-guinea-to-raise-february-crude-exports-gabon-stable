Equatorial Guinea  is set to increase
exports of Zafiro crude in February while Gabon is scheduled to
ship two lots of its Rabi Light grade, according to two loading
programs obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Three 950,000 barrel consignments of Zafiro are to be
shipped in February, two more than next month, the plan showed.
Exports of Gabon’s Rabi Light are set to be two lots of 650,000
barrels, unchanged from January, according to a second schedule.  The plans for Equatorial Guinea’s Ceiba and Aseng grades as
well as Gabon’s Rabi Blend and Mandji weren’t yet available.  Loading programs are monthly drafts of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
