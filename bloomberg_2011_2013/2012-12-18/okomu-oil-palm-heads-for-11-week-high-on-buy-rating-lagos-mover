Okomu Oil Palm Plc (OKOMUOIL)  of  Nigeria  rose
to the highest level in almost 11 weeks after Asset and Resource
Management Co. started coverage of the stock with a buy
recommendation.  The shares gained 4.7 percent to 36.65 naira by the close
in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, the highest since Oct.
3.  About 2.1 million shares, more than nine times the three-
month moving average, changed hands, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Okomu will have 22 percent annual revenue growth from 2013
to 2016 “on the back of strong domestic and industrial demand
for palm oil and the increased competitiveness of its natural
rubber exports,” ARM forecast in a note to clients yesterday.
It gave a target price of 48.46 naira for the stock.  Okomu will raise output of  palm oil  from 30 tons an hour to
60 tons from 2013, Chairman Gbenga Oyebode said in an interview
on Dec. 14.  The shares have risen 59 percent this year, compared with
32 percent for the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
