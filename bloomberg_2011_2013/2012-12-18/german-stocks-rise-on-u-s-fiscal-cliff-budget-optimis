German stocks  advanced for a third
day, with the  DAX (DAX)  Index rising to its highest in nearly five
years, amid optimism that U.S. lawmakers will agree on a budget.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  added 1.2 percent as a gauge of basic
resources stocks climbed.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  gained 2.2 percent.
 Air Berlin Plc (AB1) , Europe’s third-biggest discount carrier, jumped
8.4 percent after the airline sold its frequent flyer program.  The DAX added 0.6 percent to 7,653.58 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt, its highest level since January 2008. The
gauge has  rallied 28 percent  from its low on June 5 as European
Central Bank policy makers agreed on an unlimited bond-purchase
program and the  Federal Reserve  announced a third round of
quantitative easing. The broader HDAX Index also rose 0.6
percent today.  “As the year is coming to a close, we remain hostage to a
fiscal cliff deal,” Ion-Marc Valahu, co-founder and  fund
manager  at Clairinvest in Geneva, wrote in a message. ”So far,
markets have been helped up on the expectation a deal will
happen.”  U.S. President  Barack Obama , who met Republican House
Speaker  John Boehner  at the White House yesterday, lowered his
tax-revenue demand by $200 billion and offered to start tax rate
increases at $400,000 in income instead of $250,000.  Obama’s revised plan would raise $1.2 trillion in taxes in
the next decade and cut $1.22 trillion in spending, said a
person familiar with the talks. Obama wants a large enough debt
ceiling increase for the next two years and would accept a new
inflation yardstick that would reduce Social Security cost-of-
living increases, said the person, who sought anonymity.  Boehner Plan  Boehner said today that he will push a budget “plan B”
measure that would include tax increases on income of more than
$1 million, while continuing to negotiate with Obama.  He said that he still hopes to reach a broader budget deal
with the president and he expects the legislation to be on the
House floor by the end of the week.  Boehner spoke after he and Majority Leader  Eric Cantor 
briefed  House Republicans  on the negotiations during a private
meeting.  ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s largest steelmaker, gained 1.2
percent to 18.14 euros.  Salzgitter AG (SZG) , the second-biggest, added
2.8 percent to 40.46 euros.  Kloeckner & Co. SE, Europe’s largest independent steel
trader, advanced 0.9 percent to 9.08 euros.  A measure of commodities-linked stocks rose 1.1 percent for
the biggest gain among the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Banks Gain  Deutsche Bank and  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s two biggest
lenders, rose 2.2 percent to 33.25 euros and 3.7 percent to 1.50
euros, respectively.  Munich Re , the world’s largest reinsurer, advanced 1.7
percent to 136.65 euros.  Air Berlin surged 8.4 percent to 1.64 euros, its biggest
gain in more than 15 months, as it sold a majority stake in its
frequent flyer bonus program to partner and shareholder Etihad
Airways for 184 million euros ($242 million). The transaction
could help the discount carrier post its first annual profit
since 2007.  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , a maker of the main raw material in solar
panels, jumped 4.3 percent to 49.71 euros as  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said the renewable energy share of the market in Germany
will rise to 23 percent in 2012 from about 20 percent in 2011.  Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD) , the German pay-TV provider half-owned
by  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp., lost 0.7 percent to 4.08 euros.
 Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (KD8) , Germany’s largest cable operator,
fell 1.1 percent to 56.59 euros.  A gauge of telecommunication stocks fell the most of all
industry groups on the Stoxx 600, slipping 0.3 percent.  Adidas AG (ADS) , the world’s second-biggest sporting-goods maker,
slid 1 percent to 67.50 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
