German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
a $123 million electricity line that took a decade to develop
will improve supply security, transmitting renewable energy from
north to south and helping the nation phase out nuclear power.  The line, stretching 88 kilometers (55 miles) across two
states from Kruemmel near Hamburg to Schwerin, will ensure more
efficient distribution of power from wind farms in the north,
Erwin Sellering, governor of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
state, said today at the line’s opening in Schwerin. “On windy
days, turbines won’t have to be shut off any more,” he said.  Power supply has moved to the center of Germany’s political
agenda since Merkel decided in 2011 to replace nuclear reactors
with more fossil-fired plants and a growing share of clean-
energy sources. The Bundesnetzagentur regulator has called on
grid operators to stabilize the network as the country adds wind
farms and solar parks, whose output varies with the weather.  “The acceptance of renewables depends on our managing to
bring power from where it’s generated to where it’s needed,”
Merkel said in Schwerin.  Germany  needs to build “thousands of
kilometers” of new lines and ensure it’s done efficiently to
keep costs in check, she said.  The new link will also boost security of supply in Hamburg,
home to Germany’s largest port, said Boris Schucht, head of grid
company 50Hertz Transmission GmbH, which invested 93 million
euros ($123 million) in the line. 50Hertz operates about 9,800
kilometers of networks mainly in northeastern Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
