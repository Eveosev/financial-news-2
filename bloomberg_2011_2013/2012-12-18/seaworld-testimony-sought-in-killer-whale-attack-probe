The U.S. Labor Department asked a
court to compel  Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s SeaWorld of Florida LLC to
report how the marine theme park is easing hazards discovered
after a trainer died in an attack by a killer whale.  SeaWorld has declined to provide three managers for
interviews about steps taken after the six-ton whale grabbed
 Dawn Brancheau  at the Orlando, Florida, facility in 2010, the
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration  said today in a
news release.  The agency wants to know whether workers “continue to be
exposed to unsafe and unhealthy working conditions,” David Michaels, an assistant secretary of labor, said in the release.  The Labor Department unit on Dec. 13 asked the U.S.
District Court for the Middle of  Florida  to compel the managers’
testimony, Michael D’Aquino, a spokesman, said in an e-mail.  In an e-mail, Fred Jacobs, a SeaWorld spokesman, declined
to comment.  The Orlando facility is one of 11 operated by SeaWorld
Parks & Entertainment Inc., according to the SeaWorld website.
The company may conduct an initial public offering in early
2013, people with knowledge of the matter said this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
