United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) ’s
revised concessions in the European Union review of its bid for
 TNT Express NV (TNTE)  were sent today to rivals and customers for
comments, a person familiar with the matter said.  UPS, the world’s largest parcel-delivery company, has
modified an initial offer that included the sale of some
business units and granting access to its air network, according
to a person who asked not to be identified because the EU
negotiations are confidential. The new offer covers both the
divestments and the network access aspects, the person said. The
EU has asked for responses by midnight tomorrow in Brussels.  UPS, based in Atlanta, has twice pushed back the target
date to complete the 5.16 billion-euro ($6.8 billion) deal, its
biggest acquisition in its 105-year history, which will double
its size in  Europe , as the merger review continues.  The European Commission declined to comment on any offer.
David Stuerken, an external spokesman for UPS in  London , didn’t
immediately reply to a call and an e-mail seeking comment.
Reuters reported the remedies offer earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
