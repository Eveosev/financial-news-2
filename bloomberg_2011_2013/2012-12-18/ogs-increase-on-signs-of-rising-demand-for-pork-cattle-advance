Hog futures climbed on speculation
that lower pork prices will encourage U.S. consumers to favor
the meat over more costly beef. Cattle rose.  Wholesale  pork  prices slumped 3.9 percent last week to
81.72 cents a pound, the biggest slide since Nov. 16, while
wholesale  beef  added 0.9 percent to $1.9469 a pound, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Cattle futures jumped 13
percent in the past six months as supplies tightened, reaching
record highs the past three sessions.  “If the cattle can continue to move higher, eventually
that should spell at least better demand in the pork sector down
the road,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investment Co., said in a telephone interview from
 Minneapolis .  Hog futures for February settlement increased 0.1 percent
to 84.8 cents a pound at 10:51 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are up 0.5 percent this year through yesterday.  Cattle futures for February delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$1.3375 a pound, after reaching $1.3405, the highest ever for
the most-active contract. Prices are up 9.9 percent this year
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose less than
0.1 percent to $1.54325 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
