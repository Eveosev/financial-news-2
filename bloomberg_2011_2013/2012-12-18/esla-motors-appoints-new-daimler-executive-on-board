Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the maker of
electric vehicles led by billionaire Elon Musk, said  Daimler
AG (DAI) ’s Herbert Kohler resigned from its board and was replaced by
another executive at the German automaker.  Kohler, a member of Palo Alto, California-based Tesla’s
board since Daimler invested in the company in 2009, submitted
his resignation on Dec. 12, according to a regulatory filing.
Harald Kroeger, Daimler’s vice president of electrics,
electronics and e-Drive, was appointed director, Tesla said.  The change is the “result of a natural transition of
responsibilities at Daimler AG with respect to the development
of electric vehicle powertrains,” Tesla said in the filing,
without elaborating.  Daimler’s investment in Tesla helped the startup carmaker
remain in operation and overcome early cash and production
challenges. The company named for inventor Nikola Tesla
subsequently qualified for $465 million in federal loans to
develop and build electric cars at a retooled California plant
and won additional investments from  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and
battery maker  Panasonic Corp. (6752)   Musk this month said Tesla is  cash flow  positive, and the
carmaker has said it may earn its first profit next year from
sales of battery-powered Model S sedans.  Tesla rose 0.6 percent to $34.59 at 4:30 p.m. in New York,
and has gained 21 percent this year. The board change was
announced after the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
