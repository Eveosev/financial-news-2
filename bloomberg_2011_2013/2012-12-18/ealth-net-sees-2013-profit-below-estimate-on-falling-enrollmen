(Corrects number of quarters in which estimates were missed
in first paragraph.)  Health Net Inc. (HNT) , the medical insurer
that has  missed  analysts’ estimates two of the past three
quarters, predicted 2013 profit and sales that would also fall
below expectations.  Earnings next year will be $2 a share to $2.10 a share, on
revenue of $10.7 billion to $11.2 billion, the  Woodland Hills ,
California-based company said today in a statement. While that’s
below analyst predictions, some analyst estimates include a
California contract to treat Medicare and Medicaid patients that
Health Net has excluded because payment rates haven’t been set,
Dave Olson, a company spokesman, said in a phone interview.  Health Net shares have fallen 16 percent this year and the
company missed estimates in the first two quarters, after
difficulties with processing claims and higher-than-expected
medical costs. While premiums should rise faster than costs next
year, enrollment will drop by 1 percent to 2 percent as the
company pulls away from some markets, Health Net said.  “The company expects commercial enrollment to be more
heavily weighted to smaller accounts and tailored network
products that have lower than company-average premiums”
compared with 2012, Health Net said.  Analysts had  predicted  $2.14 a share in profit and $12.12
billion in revenue on average for 2013, according to estimates
tracked by Bloomberg. Olson said the state contract to treat
“dual eligibles” -- people covered by both Medicare and
Medicaid -- added about 6 cents to some earnings estimates.
Without it, Health Net’s guidance is in line with the analysts’
numbers, he said.  Health Net was down 1 cent to $25.65 at 8:04 p.m.  New York 
time. It gained 2 percent to close at $25.66 during regular
trading, before the earnings forecast was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
