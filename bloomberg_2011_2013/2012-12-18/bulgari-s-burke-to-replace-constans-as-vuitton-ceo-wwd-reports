Michael Burke will replace Jordi Constans as chief executive officer of  Louis Vuitton , a fashion
and accessories maker owned by  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
SA (MC) , according to Women’s Wear Daily.  Constans, who became Vuitton CEO last month, is to leave
the post immediately for medical reasons, the trade daily said
on its website, citing LVMH board member Antoine Arnault. Burke,
who moved to jeweler Bulgari from Fendi in February, takes over
at Vuitton tomorrow, WWD said. All three are LVMH brands.  LVMH spokesman Olivier Labesse didn’t immediately return a
call to his office or respond to a message left on his mobile
phone seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
