South African wheat futures fell to
the lowest in more than two months after the rand strengthened,
cutting the cost of imports.  Wheat for delivery in March, the most active contract,
dropped 0.9 percent to 3,585 rand ($419) a metric ton, the
lowest since Oct. 3, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange in Johannesburg. Yellow corn for July delivery,
retreated for an eighth day, the longest streak of declines
since at least January, losing 0.1 percent to 2,178 rand a ton.  The rand appreciated 1.4 percent to 8.5420 per dollar
yesterday, the strongest since Oct. 4, and traded little changed
at 8.5501 by 3:27 p.m. in Johannesburg today.  “Prices are down today following what happened with the
rand yesterday and on Friday,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  South Africa  is a net importer of the grain and sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer after  Ethiopia .  White corn for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to 2,320
rand a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
