The New Year may open with below-
normal temperatures for the U.S. Midwest and mid-Atlantic
region, said  Matt Rogers , president of the Commodity Weather
Group LLC.  Weather patterns over Alaska and the Pacific Ocean may help
push colder air into the U.S., sending temperatures about 3
degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 Celsius) lower than usual across much of
the country from Dec. 28 to Jan. 1, Rogers said today in a note
to clients.  “One lingering complication is an upper-level trough over
the West that would offer ripples in the pattern with more
variability,” said Rogers, who’s based in Bethesda, Maryland.  Below-normal temperatures in the large cities of the
Midwest and Northeast may increase energy demand to warm homes
and businesses, pushing up natural gas and heating oil prices.  MDA Weather Services  predicted more seasonal temperatures
along the East Coast and across the Midwest in the same period.
The Gaithersburg, Maryland-based company expects the coldest air
in western  Canada  and along the West Coast, with temperatures
falling 3 to 7 degrees below normal.  In New York, the normal average temperature for Dec. 25 is
about 36 degrees, according to MDA. It is 32 in Boston; 25 in
Chicago; 32 in St. Louis; 53 in Houston; 19 in Calgary,  Alberta ;
35 in  Seattle ; and 49 in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
