Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s largest food
company, forecasts sales in Saudia Arabia may increase as much
as 20 percent next year driven by consumer demand, said Yves
Manghardt, chief executive officer of Nestle Middle East.  “It’s a very important market for us,” said Manghardt in
an interview yesterday in the capital Riyadh. “Nestle in Saudi
Arabia contributes roughly 30 percent of our business in the
Middle East.”  The Vevey, Switzerland based company, which recorded sales
of about 2.5 billion riyals ($700 million) in the kingdom this
year, has added bottling facilities and distribution centers in
the past two years. Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s biggest
economy, has benefited from inward investment while other
countries in the region grapple with civil war and political
instability.  Saudi Arabia’s $597 billion economy will grow 5.1 percent
this year, the second-fastest pace in seven years, according to
the median forecast of 17 economists compiled by Bloomberg. By
contrast, growth in the Group of 10 industrialized nations will
slow to 1.27 percent from 1.31 percent, the forecasts show.  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  in December last year bought a 42 percent
stake in Saudi company Alamar Foods, which operates Dominos and
Wendy’s restaurants as well as a food processing plant which
supplies them.  Arab Spring  Consumer demand and investment has plunged in the past two
years in the Arab world as a result of popular uprisings that
led to the toppling of leaders in Tunisia,  Egypt , Libya, and
Yemen. Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah spent an additional 224
billion riyals last year aimed at creating jobs, building homes
and raising salaries for the armed forces.  Nestle Middle East has invested more than $400 million in
the region since its inception in 1997, owning and operating 17
factories and employing 7,000 people, predicting sales to grow
to $3.3 billion by 2017 from $1.4 billion in 2009.  “We have provided 230 jobs in Saudi Arabia, 37 percent of
them are occupied by Saudis and we aim for that number to reach
40 percent soon,” said Roger Meguerdichian, country manager,
Nestle Saudi Arabia. “Our investment in head-count will
increase 30 percent in 2013.”  Nestle, whose brands include KitKat chocolate bars and
bottled water Vittel, has gained 11.4 percent this year while
the Swiss Market Index rose 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
