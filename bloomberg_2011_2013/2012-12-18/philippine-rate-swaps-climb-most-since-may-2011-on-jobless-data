Philippine one-year  interest-rate
swaps  climbed the most since May 2011 as traders pared bets for
a cut in borrowing costs after data showed the unemployment rate
dropped the least in more than a year.  The  jobless rate  was 6.8 percent in October, compared with
7 percent in July, the National Statistics Office reported
today. The 0.2 percentage point decline was the smallest since
July 2011. The figures are released every three months. Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas held its benchmark rate at a record low of
3.5 percent last week after cutting it 100 basis points this
year to support growth. Inflation cooled to 2.8 percent in
November, the least in five months.  “The low unemployment rate limits their ability to cut
interest rates,” said Rees Kam, a strategist at SJS Markets
Ltd., a Hong Kong-based financial services company that
specializes in fixed-income securities. “That’s why interest-
rate swaps are higher.”  The one-year swap rose 40 basis points, or 0.4 percentage
point, to 1.025 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contract fell in each of the last five months as
investors boosted bets for lower borrowing costs. The five-year
rate increased 20 basis points to 1.575 percent.  The Philippine economy grew 7.1 percent in third quarter
from a year earlier, the fastest pace in Southeast Asia. The
peso strengthened 6.7 percent this year, the second-best
performing currency among the 11-most active currencies in Asia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
