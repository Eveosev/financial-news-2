The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in Asia from non-payment fell to a more than 17-
month low, according to traders of credit-default swaps and data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 0.5 basis point to 109 basis
points as of 9:08 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices
show. The measure is set for its lowest close since July 2011,
according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 2 basis points
to 122 as of 12:07 p.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. The benchmark is on course for its lowest since August
last year, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped one to 161.25 as of
10:26 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The gauge is
set for its lowest close since April 6, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
