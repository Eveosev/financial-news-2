BP Plc (BP/)  Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley met with Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev  and State Oil Co.
of Azerbaijan President Rovnaq Abdullayev to discuss efforts to
stem a drop in output that drew criticism from the government.  The measures would “quickly” stabilize oil production in
the Caspian Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field, Abdullayev said today
in a statement. Partners in the largest Azeri deposit completed
plans for its short and long-term development, the Baku-based
state oil producer, known as Socar, said in the  release .  Dudley “gave a positive assessment” of the work carried
out in the past three months, according to the statement.  BP replaced regional managers to “address the technical
challenges” of the field after ACG output fell 12 percent in
the first half, drawing criticism of the company from Aliyev.  To contact the reporter on this story:
