European power for next week
declined to the lowest since 2009 as warmer-than-average weather
was forecast during the holidays.  Baseload week-ahead power in  Germany , for supplies
delivered around the clock, slid as much as 8.3 percent while
the French peakload contract fell 29 percent. Mild weather can
cut demand for heating.  German power for the last week of the year lost 2.55 euros
to 28.25 euros ($37.35) a megawatt-hour, the lowest since Dec.
23, 2009, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
Peakload French power, delivered from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., dropped
13 euros to 32.50 euros, the least since July 1, 2009.  The minimum temperature in Frankfurt will be 5 degrees
Celsius (41 Fahrenheit) on Dec. 25 versus a five-year average of
minus 4 degrees, CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg show. The
maximum temperature in Paris is predicted to rise to 6 degrees
Celsius on that date compared with an average for the time of
year of 1 degree.  Demand in  France ,  Europe ’s second-biggest power market, may
reach 56,700 megawatts on Dec. 25, according to a forecast on
the  website  of Reseau de Transport d’Electricite, the network
operator. That compares with 73,422 megawatts today.  Available generating capacity in Germany is forecast to
fall to 66,966 megawatts on Dec. 26 from 68,802 megawatts today,
according to data from European Energy Exchange AG.  German power for 2013 was little changed, adding 7 cents to
45.40 euros a megawatt-hour, broker data show. Electricity for
January declined 0.2 percent to 47.60 euros.  The  German 2013 clean-dark spread , a measure of the profit
utilities get from selling electricity after accounting for the
cost of coal and emissions permits, fell 1.1 percent to 9.92
euros a megawatt-hour, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
