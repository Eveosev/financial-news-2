 OAO Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil
producer operating in Siberia, won rights to the Shpilman field
with a 46.2 billion-ruble ($1.5 billion) bid, according to a
statement on the website of subsoil agency Rosnedra.  Surgutneftegas outbid  Russia ’s biggest oil company,  OAO
Rosneft (ROSN) , and OAO Gazprom Neft, the statement shows. The starting
price was 14 billion rubles.  The acquisition will be a boon to the Surgut-based oil
producer, Russia’s fourth-largest, which lost out to TNK-BP in
an auction of the Lodochnoye deposit earlier this month. Energy
explorers are investing in Siberia to revive aging fields and
open up new areas for development as President  Vladimir Putin 
offers tax incentives to spur output.  Surgutneftegas had more than $32 billion in cash at the end
of September, VTB Capital data show. That gives it the means to
buy Shpilman, a field it’s already explored, according to
 Alexander Nazarov , an analyst at OAO Gazprombank. While it’s
costlier than Lodochnoye, it’s closer to other Surgut operations
so spending on infrastructure won’t be as high, he said.  TNK-BP won the Lodochnoye field with an offer of 4.66
billion rubles.  No one at Surgutneftegas was available for comment.
