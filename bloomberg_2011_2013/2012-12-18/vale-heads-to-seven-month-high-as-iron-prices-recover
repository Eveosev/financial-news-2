Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, climbed to a seven-month high as prices for the
steelmaking material rebound.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro,  climbed  for an eighth day,
gaining 1.7 percent to 41 reais at the close in  Sao Paulo , the
highest since May 3. The Brazilian benchmark Bovespa Index
 gained  1.5 percent.  Iron ore for  immediate delivery  rose to a five-month high
of $132.20 a metric ton yesterday, according to a  price index 
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The recovery from a three-year
low in September stems from rising Chinese demand, said Laurence
Balter, who oversees $100 million including Vale shares at
Oracle Investment Research in Fox Island, Washington.  “Vale is in the sweet spot for this rebound,” he said in
e-mailed comments. “ Iron-ore  prices were far too low.”  Vale is  up  28 percent from a three-year low on Sept. 4.,
outperforming the Bovespa’s 7.5 percent increase in the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
