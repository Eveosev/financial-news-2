Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, rallied after announcing that
it will issue subordinated debt to fund as much as $1 billion in
share buybacks.  The insurer climbed 2.6 percent to $41.83 at 10:54 a.m. in
New York, the biggest increase in the 22-company Standard &
Poor’s 500 Insurance Index. Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate
disclosed the repurchase authorization in a statement yesterday
after the close of regular trading.  Chief Executive Officer Tom Wilson, 55, is taking advantage
of near record-low borrowing costs to boost shareholder returns
after severe weather in recent years increased claims costs. The
insurer has been raising the price of homeowners’ coverage and
shrinking its annuity business to help reach its  goal  of a 13
percent return on equity by 2014.  “Issuing inexpensive debt to buy back stock gives Allstate
a little more wiggle room to increase its quarterly dividend”
to 30 cents a share,  Meyer Shields , an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co., wrote yesterday in a note to clients.  Allstate cut its  dividend  in half to 20 cents a share in
2009, after investment writedowns drained capital. The payout is
currently 22 cents a share. The insurer recently completed a $1
billion buyback authorization, according to yesterday’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
