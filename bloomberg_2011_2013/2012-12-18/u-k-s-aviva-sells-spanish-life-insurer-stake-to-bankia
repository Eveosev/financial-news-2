Aviva Plc (AV/) , the U.K.’s second-biggest
insurer by market value, said it will sell its stake in joint
venture Aseval to  Bankia SA (BKIA)  for about 608 million euros ($803
million).  Aviva will receive the cash payment for the holding in the
Spanish life insurer by April 30, the London-based firm said in
a statement today. The deal will increase Aviva’s surplus
capital by about 500 million pounds ($813 million), it said.  CGU Plc, which merged with Norwich Union Plc to become
Aviva, bought the stake in 2000 for about 200 million pounds,
allowing it to sell life insurance and pensions to customers of
Spanish lender, Bancaja, which became part of the Bankia group
in 2010. Aviva Chairman John McFarlane has pledged to sell
businesses that tie up 6 billion pounds of capital to build
reserves eroded by the European sovereign debt crisis.  “This settlement is in line with our strategy to increase
Aviva’s financial strength,” McFarlane said in the statement.
The insurer will continue to serve customers in  Spain  through
its other bank partners and distribution agencies, he said.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
