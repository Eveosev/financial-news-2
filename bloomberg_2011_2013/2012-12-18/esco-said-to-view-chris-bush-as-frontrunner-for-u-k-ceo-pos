Tesco Plc (TSCO) , Britain’s biggest grocer,
considers the chief operating officer of its domestic business
to be a frontrunner for the role of U.K. chief executive
officer, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Chris Bush, a 30-year veteran of the Cheshunt, England-
based company, is among candidates that also include John
Scouler, commercial director for fresh and packaged foods, said
the person, who declined to be identified because a decision has
not yet been made. Bush, who had led Tesco’s Thai unit since
2010, was called back this year to help a turnaround at home.  Tesco CEO Philip Clarke has been overseeing the domestic
business since March, when  Richard Brasher  left the retailer in
the wake of the failed Big Price Drop campaign and the first
reduction of profit guidance in two decades.  An announcement on the company’s U.K. leadership may be
made as soon as next month, the Financial Times reported
earlier, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Tesco spokesman Tom Hoskin declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
