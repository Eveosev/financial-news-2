Vietnam ’s one-year bonds rose, with
the yield dropping by the most since July, on speculation banks
stepped up purchases as they expect an interest-rate cut before
the end of the year. The dong was little changed.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam said Dec. 10 that it wants to
lower borrowing costs as macroeconomic conditions allow. The
central bank has reduced its refinancing rate to 10 percent from
15 percent in 2012 to boost an  economy  it forecasts will grow
5.2 percent this year, the least since 1999. Inflation was 7.1
percent in November, compared with almost 20 percent a year
earlier, official figures show. The government will release
December consumer-price data before year-end.  “Banks still have capital to lend out and they believe
 interest rates  will go down,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi
Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co.  The yield on the one-year bonds fell 10 basis points, or
0.10 percentage point, to 8.70 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
steepest decline since July 30 and the lowest level since Aug.
20. The yield has fallen 4.04 percentage points this year.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 3:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, unchanged from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The State Bank of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
