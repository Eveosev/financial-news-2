Xylem Inc. (XYL) , the ITT Corp. spinoff
whose pumps helped clean  Hurricane Sandy  floodwaters, said it
entered into an off-balance sheet agreement for as much as 120
million euros ($158 million) to finance research and development
projects in Europe.  The agreement between the water companyâ€™s Luxembourg unit
and the European Investment Bank is part of an initiative with
the EIB and European Commission for R&D in the European Union.
The funds will be available from 2013 to 2016 as loans to
finance projects at Xylem facilities in the U.K., Germany,
Italy, Austria, Sweden, Norway and Hungary, the company said in
a filing. No agreement funds to date have been drawn, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
