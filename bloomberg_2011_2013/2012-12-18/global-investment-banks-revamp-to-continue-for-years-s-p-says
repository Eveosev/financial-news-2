Global investment banks are likely
to go on cutting costs and deleveraging for several years as
regulators push them to bolster capital, ratings company
 Standard & Poor’s  said.  “Tougher regulatory requirements for capital and leverage
are set to lower the industry’s return on equity potential,
causing banks to reassess the scale of their capital market
activities,” Standard & Poor’s credit analyst Richard Barnes
said in a statement today.  Inconsistencies in how regulators are implementing global
capital rules explain the “uneven” way in which banks are
restructuring, with some, such as  Switzerland ’s  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
announcing more extensive overhauls than competitors, he said.
Most investment banks have “fewer incentives” to reposition
their business models, he added.  UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank, said in October it would
cut about 10,000 jobs and retreat from capital-intensive
trading businesses to boost profitability.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the
U.K.’s second-biggest lender, will announce the results of a
review of its operations in February. That may result in 3,500
job reductions at its securities unit,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
analysts led by Frederik Thomasen estimated last month.  “Eventually, continued consolidation of the industry may
result in stronger market shares and possibly margins for the
leading ‘flow monsters,’” Barnes said.  The rating company estimated that capital markets revenue
climbed 5 percent in 2012 over the previous year, with U.S.
banks outperforming their European competitors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
