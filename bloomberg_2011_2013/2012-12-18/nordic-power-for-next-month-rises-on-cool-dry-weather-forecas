Nordic electricity for delivery next
month rose after forecasts for freezing temperatures and dry
weather pointed to increased demand and reduced supply.  Low temperatures in Oslo may drop to minus 14 degrees
Celsius (7 Fahrenheit) tomorrow from minus 2 today, according to
CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. That compares with a 10-
year seasonal average of minus 9.  The Nordic region’s hydropower reserves, which exceed the
seasonal average by 0.4 terawatt-hours, may drop to a deficit of
3 terawatt-hours in two weeks, according to Markedskraft AS data
on Bloomberg. The region gets more than half of its yearly power
supplies by running water through turbines, and has had a water
surplus since late June 2011.  The year-end holiday season will cut power demand in the
next two weeks, damping prices for baseload around-the-clock
delivery, SEB AB,  Sweden ’s third-largest bank, said yesterday in
an e-mailed report.  Power for next week was quoted at 35.10 euros a megawatt-
hour, while the contract for delivery the following week was
quoted at 39.50 euros, according to data from the Nasdaq OMX
Group’s exchange. That compares with tomorrow’s price for
around-the-clock supply of 48.39 euros, according to data the
Nord Pool Spot AS energy exchanges in Oslo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
