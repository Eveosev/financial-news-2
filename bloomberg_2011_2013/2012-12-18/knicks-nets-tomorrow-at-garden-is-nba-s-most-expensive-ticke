Tickets for tonight’s game between
the first-place  New York Knicks  and the Brooklyn Nets at Madison
Square Garden are the most expensive of the National Basketball
Association season on the resale market.  The average listing for the game, the first between the two
teams at the Knicks’ home court in Manhattan, is $630.51,
according to ticket-aggregator TiqIQ.  That eclipses the previous high of the NBA season, the
$529.39 average listing for a Nov. 26 game between the same
teams at Barclays Center, postponed from Nov. 1 by  Hurricane
Sandy . Tickets were listed at $448.10 for their second meeting
in Brooklyn on Dec. 11.  “Any time bragging rights are on the line between
intercity rivals, whether it be in New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, fan excitement rises and so do the prices they’re
willing to pay,” TiqIQ spokesman Chris Matcovich said yesterday
in an e-mail.  The Knicks (18-6) lead the Eastern Conference, one game
ahead of  LeBron James  and the defending-champion  Miami Heat . New
York forward  Carmelo Anthony , who has missed the past two games
with a sprained ankle, is scoring 27.9 points per game -- second
only to  Kobe Bryant  of the  Los Angeles Lakers  -- and the team is
averaging a league-low 10.8 turnovers per contest.  NBA’s Highest  The Knicks have the highest average home ticket resale
listings in the NBA at $337.14, according to TiqIQ. The Nets are
third at $190.05, behind the Lakers at $279.21.  Brooklyn opened the season a franchise-best 11-4, then lost
five straight with center Brook Lopez, its leading scorer and
shot blocker, out with a foot injury. The Nets lost 92-90 at
home to the  Utah Jazz  last night to fall to 13-11.  The Knicks have sold out 77 straight games at the Garden,
which is two-thirds through a $1 billion, privately funded
renovation, according to MSG spokeswoman Stacey Escudero, who
said the team doesn’t announce each game’s sales until tip-off.
Face value for Knicks tickets range from $10 to $3,600 for
courtside seats that are part of season packages, she said.  The new crosstown rivalry and both teams’ success this
season has boosted resale ticket prices dramatically. In the
previous two seasons, tickets for Knicks-Nets games at the
Garden were listed for an average of $205.99, while tickets to
see the two teams at the Nets’ previous home, the Prudential
Center in Newark, New Jersey, were listed for $147.87.  “It is a rivalry and it’s great for  New York ,” Anthony
said after the teams’ last meeting, a 100-97 Knicks victory in
Brooklyn. “When we come here, it’s a battle, and when they come
there, it’s going to be a battle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
