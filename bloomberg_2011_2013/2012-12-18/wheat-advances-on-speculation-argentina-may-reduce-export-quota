Wheat advanced on speculation that
 Argentina , the largest South American shipper, may further cut
its export quota, adding to global supply concerns and prompting
some investors to end bets on declines.  The grain for delivery in March climbed as much as 0.7
percent to $8.14 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and was
at $8.1025 at 10:24 a.m. in  Singapore . That takes the gain this
year to 24 percent, making it the best performer on the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Commodity Index of 24 raw materials.  Low yields in Argentina in may trigger a second export-
quota reduction two weeks to 3.37 million metric tons, after the
nation unofficially cut the volume 25 percent to 4.5 million
tons, La Nacion reported yesterday, citing producers it didn’t
identify. The nation’s crop was damaged by drought in some areas
and excessive rains in others, the newspaper said.  “Investors are probably covering their shorts,”  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at Astmax Co. Ltd., said by
phone from Tokyo, referring to investors closing bets on price
declines. “There’s some uncertainty in production of wheat in
the U.S. and exports in Argentina, and that’s probably the
reason they think prices are near the bottom.”  Exports from all shippers are already forecast by the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  to slump 16 percent to 132.8 million
tons, the smallest since 2011. That forecast is based on an
estimate Argentina’s shipments will be 5.5 million tons. World
exports are falling after dry weather from Australia to  Russia 
curbed global output. Persistent drought in the U.S. threatens
the winter crop for harvest in the 2013-2014 marketing year.  Corn for March delivery was little changed at $7.2375 a
bushel in  Chicago , 12 percent higher this year. Soybeans for
delivery in the same month lost 0.4 percent to $14.8275 a bushel,
paring the annual advance to 23 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
