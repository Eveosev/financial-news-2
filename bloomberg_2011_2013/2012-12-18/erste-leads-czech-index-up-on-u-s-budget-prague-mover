Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  increased to its
highest in more than 15 months, leading Czech shares to a 10-
month high, as  Hungary  signaled it may ease taxes on lenders and
amid signs of progress in the U.S. budget talks.  Austria’s Erste climbed 3 percent to 602.5 koruna by 12:24
p.m. in Prague, the strongest price since September 2011 and for
the seventh straight day of gains. The  PX (PX)  equity index, where
Erste has a 28 percent weighting, jumped 1.3 percent.  Banks are among the biggest gainers in Europe today amid
optimism that U.S. lawmakers will reach an agreement on the
budget to avert more than $600 billion in automatic spending
cuts and tax increases. Hungary, one of Erste’s markets, may
allow lenders to lower their bank tax payment in exchange for
stepping up lending, Gyula Pleschinger, state secretary at the
 Economy Ministry , told Portfolio news website today.  “Erste gains are linked with the improved chances for an
agreement on how to avoid the U.S. fiscal cliff and with signals
that the Hungarian government’s position on banks may be
changing,” Marek Hatlapatka, an analyst a Cyrrus brokerage in
Brno,  Czech Republic , said in e-mailed comments. “Erste shares
are traditionally sensitive to this type of news.”  In Vienna, its home exchange, Erste shares also jumped 3
percent to 23.925 euros. The stock has gained 76 percent since
the end of 2011 and headed for its biggest yearly rally on
record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
