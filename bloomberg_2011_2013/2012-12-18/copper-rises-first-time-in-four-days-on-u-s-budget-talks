Copper gained for the first time in
four days on speculation that U.S. lawmakers will reach an
agreement on the budget. Lead and nickel advanced.  Metal for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.3
percent to $8,085 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $8,075 by 10:38 a.m. Shanghai time. The
contract has gained 6.3 percent this year. The March contract on
the Comex in  New York  rose 0.4 percent to $3.679 a pound.  Asian stocks rose to a nine-month high and oil climbed on
signs of progress in U.S. budget talks. President  Barack Obama 
proposed a budget plan that would cut about $1.2 trillion in
federal spending and raise a similar amount in taxes, according
to a person familiar with the talks.  “The news fueled optimism that the fiscal problems can be
properly addressed,” Zhang Tianfeng, an analyst at Dongxing
Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “In  China , we noticed
the  property market  is recovering, and this is good news for
demand next year.”  China’s new home prices climbed in 53 of the 70 cities in
November from the previous month, data from the National Bureau
of Statistics showed today. That was the most in 18 months, and
compared with 35 in October.  Copper for March delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell 0.2 percent to 58,000  yuan  ($9,299) a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
