Russia , the world’s third biggest
 wheat exporter  last season, is slowing grain exports as domestic
prices are approaching a peak, said ZAO Rusagrotrans, the
country’s biggest grain carrier by rail.  Grain exports declined 21 percent to 12.4 million metric
tons from the start of the season on July 1 through Dec. 12,
compared with 15.6 million tons a year earlier, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said in a statement today.  “Exports are slowing down,” Igor Pavensky, Rusagrotrans’
analytical department head, said by phone in Moscow today.
“This is good for Russia, because we are within our exports
potential and at the same time have enough grain to satisfy
domestic demand.”  High domestic prices have slowed the export pace and will
make imports from Kazakhstan reasonable for Russian consumers by
the end of January, he said.  Domestic grain prices continued to rise last week due to
demand from local millers and feedstuffs producers, the ministry
said. Feed wheat rose the most, advancing 3.1 percent to 10,091
rubles ($326) a ton in the European part of
Russia last week, it said in a statement.  If prices reach 13,500 rubles a ton in the Moscow and St.
Petersburg regions, or the maximum level forecast for the areas,
local consumers may start importing grain from further away than
 Kazakhstan , Pavensky said.  Total imports of grains are estimated at 1.8 million tons,
including 900,000 tons of wheat, for the season 2012-13, he
said.  Wheat, Barley  Russia may export 1 million tons of grains this month,
including 500,000 tons of wheat, 160,000 tons of barley and
260,000 tons of corn, Pavensky estimated. That’s down from 1.6
million tons shipped in November, which included 980,000 tons of
wheat and 340,000 tons of barley.  Total exports in the season may reach 10 million tons of
wheat, 2.1 million tons of barley and about 2 million tons of
corn, he said.  Wheat for March delivery fell 0.6 percent to $8.0325 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 7:02 p.m. Moscow time.
It’s advanced 23 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
