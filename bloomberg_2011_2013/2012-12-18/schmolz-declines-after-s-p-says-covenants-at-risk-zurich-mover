Schmolz + Bickenbach AG (STLN)  dropped as
much as 3.8 percent after  Standard & Poor’s  said the Swiss maker
of steel for the car industry risks breaking covenants on its
debt next year.  The stock traded 1.5 percent lower at 2.58 francs as of
9:47 a.m. in Zurich, bringing the decline this year to 52
percent. Trading volume was about 40 percent the six-month
average.  S&P downgraded the steelmaker’s credit rating to B- from B
yesterday and said it may cut it again if Schmolz doesn’t
succeed in renegotiating covenant agreements on its debt.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in
2012 will probably drop about 53 percent, more than the ratings
company had expected, S&P added.  Schmolz gets about a third of its sales from the European
car industry, which is likely to suffer from a “protracted
recession” in 2013, the ratings company said. European Union
car sales fell to a 19-year low in the first 11 months of 2012,
a report showed last week.  “After obtaining covenant waiver approvals from the core
banks for the rest of 2012, the company’s management will likely
take proactive actions to ensure covenant compliance next
year,” S&P said. “However, what approach the banks will take
is difficult to foresee in the context of lingering industrial
weakness in  Europe  and their own reduced risk appetite.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
