Whole-milk powder prices fell for a
fourth straight auction to the lowest in three months, said
 Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. (FCG)   Powder for February delivery fell 1 percent, according to a
trade-weighted index on the company’s  GlobalDairyTrade  website.
The near-term contract for  New Zealand  product fell to $3,126 a
metric ton, the lowest price since Sept. 18.  Milk prices are falling as new season output from New
Zealand and other southern hemisphere producers enters the
market. Prices remain 23 percent higher than in mid-July after
the worst U.S. drought in 56 years curbed supply. Fonterra last
week raised its forecast payment to farmers, saying it expects
higher global dairy prices in the first half of 2013.  The Auckland-based company, which accounts for about 40
percent of the global trade in dairy products, sells whole, skim
and butter-milk powder, dried-milk fat, lactose, cheese and
casein at its GlobalDairyTrade auctions. It offers monthly
contracts with delivery starting from two months after the sale.
Casein is a protein found in milk.  Whole-milk powder for March delivery was unchanged while
prices across all five product contracts out to June fell 0.6
percent, Fonterra said.  In other auctions, prices for February delivery of skim and
butter milk powder also fell. Milk protein concentrate, cheddar,
milk fat and casein prices rose. Lactose wasn’t offered in the
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
