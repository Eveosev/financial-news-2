Spain’s government bonds rose, with
 two-year  yields falling toward the lowest level in two weeks, as
borrowing costs declined at a 3.52 billion-euro ($4.65 billion)
bills auction.  Five-year yields dropped the most in almost three weeks as
the country met the maximum target the Treasury set for the last
debt sale of the year. Italian 10-year bonds rose for a third
day as the nation’s Senate begins discussing the government’s
2013 budget plan.  Germany ’s 10-year  yields  climbed to the
highest in two weeks before a report tomorrow that economists
said will show business confidence increased in December.  “Today’s Spain sale is mildly reassuring and 2012 is now
done and dusted,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist at RIA
Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “While the market will
probably start looking ahead to next year’s sales, Spanish bonds
will stay supported into the end of the year.”  Spain’s two-year yields fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.86 percent at 4:40 p.m. London time. The
rate dropped to 2.84 percent on Dec. 13, the lowest level since
Dec. 4. The 3.3 percent security maturing in October 2014 rose
0.075, or 75 euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.785.  The five-year yield lost 18 basis points to 4.08 percent
after sliding as much as 19 basis points, the steepest decline
since Nov. 28.  Spain sold three-month bills at an average yield of 1.195
percent, down from 1.254 percent at a previous auction on Nov.
27, and six-month securities at 1.609 percent, compared with
1.669 percent last month.  The yield on  Italy ’s 10-year bond declined 12 basis points
to 4.45 percent.  Monti Resignation  Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Monti has said he will resign
by the end of this week after approval of the budget law. That
decision would allow President Giorgio Napolitano to dissolve
parliament.  German 10-year bund yields increased four basis points to
1.42 percent, the highest since Dec. 4.  The Munich-based Ifo institute’s business climate  index 
climbed to 102 from 101.4 in November, according to the median
estimate of 43 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  “If Ifo is in line with market expectations tomorrow, the
risk-on mode can continue to dominate,” said  Patrick Jacq , a
senior fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in Paris.
“There may be a moderate increase in bund yields.”  Volatility on Spanish debt was the highest among euro-area
nations tracked by Bloomberg, followed by those of Ireland and
 Austria , according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-
year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  Greece  sold 1.3 billion euros of three-month bills at an
average yield of 4.11 percent, down from 4.2 percent at a prior
auction on Nov. 13.  German bunds returned 4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
debt earned 20 percent and Spanish bonds gained 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
