A cross-border agreement between
Navarra government officials in Spain and French counterparts in
Ainhoa resulted in the inauguration of the Dantxarinea
wastewater treatment plant following a year of construction.  The new infrastructure and increased capacity, which helps
cater to hotel and commercial demands in Urdax, was built by
 Suez Environnement (SEV) ’s water treatment unit Degremont using Cyclor
technology for the secondary treatment of effluents, according
to InfoEnviro. Suez is Europe’s second-largest water company
after Paris-based  Veolia Environnement SA. (VIE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
