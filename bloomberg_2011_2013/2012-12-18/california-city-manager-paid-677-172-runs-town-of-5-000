A  California  desert town with a population of little more than 5,000 paid its city manager $677,172 last year, making him the most well-compensated city worker in the most populous U.S. state, according to new data released by the state’s controller.  The town of Indian Wells near  Palm Springs  in Riverside County, 120 miles (199 kilometers) east of  Los Angeles , granted former city manager  Greg Johnson  $230,697 in salary and another $446,475 in “other pay” according to the  data  released yesterday. The other pay was a severance package.
