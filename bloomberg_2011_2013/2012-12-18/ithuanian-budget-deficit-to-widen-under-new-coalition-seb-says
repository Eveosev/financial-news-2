Lithuania’s budget deficit is set to
widen next year, even as the Baltic nation’s new coalition
pledges to trim it to less than 3 percent of economic output,
 SEB AB (SEBA)  said.  The shortfall will probably reach 3.5 percent of gross
domestic product in 2013 and 2014 after shrinking to about 3
percent this year, the Swedish bank’s Lithuanian unit said today
in a report. The four-party coalition plans to adopt a 2013
budget this week with a 2.5 percent deficit.  Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius’s government, which
took office last week, “still needs to disprove the skeptics,
showing with deeds and not just words that it intends to
maintain fiscal discipline,” SEB said. Pressure to implement
pre-election spending pledges will make that difficult, it said.  Lithuanian GDP will advance 3.2 percent in 2013 and 3.5
percent in 2014, SEB forecast, lowering previous estimates of 4
percent growth for both years. It left this year’s forecast
unchanged at 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
