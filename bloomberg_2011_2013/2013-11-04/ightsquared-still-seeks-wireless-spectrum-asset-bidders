LightSquared Inc.,  Philip Falcone ’s
wireless spectrum company, still seeking alternative bids to the
$2.22 billion cash offer from Charles Ergen’s  Dish Network Corp. (DISH) 
for its assets, has contacted more than 90 potentially
interested parties.  LightSquared is working at the direction of a special
committee of its board with Moelis & Co. to engage potential
offers, the company said Nov. 1 in court papers filed in
 Manhattan  bankruptcy court. A bankruptcy auction has been
planned for Dec. 6, with Ergen’s offer serving as a stalking
horse, or beginning bid.  “These efforts, which are designed to engender robust
participation in the auction process, will continue in earnest
in close coordination with LightSquared’s key creditor
constituencies,” company lawyers wrote.  The company said it has told Dish that any purchase of its
assets won’t include the claims it has against GPS
manufacturers.  LightSquared sued Deere & Co., Garmin International Inc.,
 Trimble Navigation Ltd. (TRMB) , the U.S. GPS Industry Council and the
Coalition to Save Our GPS on Nov. 1, as part of its bankruptcy
case, saying their misrepresentations about the flawed designs
of their products forced it into bankruptcy.  The lawsuit is an asset that “should be separately
evaluated by potential bidders as part of LightSquared’s ongoing
marketing process,” the company said in court papers.  Lawsuit Claims  LightSquared alleged in the complaint that defendants
promised that after it resolved its “out-of-band-emissions”
problems, its network wouldn’t interfere with global positioning
system receivers.  The broken promises “prevented the timely launch of a
nationwide wireless broadband network, caused LightSquared to
lose investments and contracts worth billions of dollars, and
deprived the public of much needed broadband spectrum,”
LightSquared said in the complaint.  LightSquared, based in Reston,  Virginia , filed for
bankruptcy in May 2012, listing assets of $4.48 billion and debt
of $2.29 billion. U.S. regulators blocked the service after
makers and users of GPS devices, including the U.S. military and
commercial airlines, said LightSquared’s signals would confound
navigation equipment.  The company will have creditors vote on four competing plans
of reorganization: one from the company; one from an ad-hoc
group of lenders; one from Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners
LLC, and one from U.S. Bank NA and Mast Capital Management LLC.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
