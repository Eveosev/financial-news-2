(Corrects date in headline.)  Flint Hills Resources LLC plans to
perform fluid catalytic cracker work on the west side of its
Corpus Christi, Texas, refinery in September 2015, said a person
familiar with the schedule.  The maintenance will probably last at least 30 days, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  Jake Reint, a Flint Hills spokesman based in Rosemount,
 Minnesota , didn’t respond to e-mail requests for comment.  The refinery has a capacity of 305,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
