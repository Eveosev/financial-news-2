Nationale Suisse (NATN)  climbed the most in
more than three years after Mobiliar boosted its stake in the
Swiss insurer, increasing the probability of a takeover.  The stock increased as much as 6.5 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since April 2010, and was up 6.2 percent at 47.50
francs at 12:48 p.m. in Zurich. About 93,000 shares traded
hands, more than seven times the average daily volume of the
past three months.  Swiss insurer Mobiliar became Nationale Suisse’s biggest
shareholder last week after it bought a 7.8 percent stake in the
Basel-based insurer from  Germany ’s VHV Allgemeine Versicherung
AG. It now holds 19.2 percent, Nationale Suisse said on Nov. 1
after markets closed.  “Mobiliar has achieved the pole position in the long-term
race for Nationale Suisse,” Stefan Schuermann, an analyst at
Vontobel in Zurich, said in a note to investors today. “We do
not expect Nationale Suisse to be taken over in the short run,
but see an increased probability from a two to three year
perspective.”  Baloise Holding AG (BALN)  holds 9.9 percent of Nationale Suisse
and  Helvetia Holding AG (HELN)  owns 12.05 percent. Shareholder
Nuernberg Versicherung may in the “long run” sell its 6.5
percent stake, Schuermann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
