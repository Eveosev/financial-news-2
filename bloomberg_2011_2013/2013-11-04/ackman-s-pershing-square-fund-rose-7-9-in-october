Pershing Square Capital Management
LP, the $11 billion activist hedge-fund firm run by  Bill Ackman ,
posted a 7.9 percent net gain in its main strategy in October,
according to a performance update obtained by Bloomberg News.  Pershing Square International’s monthly return brings its
year-to-date gain to 8.1 percent, according to the update. The
fund has $5 billion in assets.  Ackman, known for amassing stakes in companies and pushing
them to make changes to boost share prices, rebounded in October
after his fund was mostly unchanged in the first nine months of
the year. Ackman said in a letter to investors last month that
he changed his bet on shares of  Herbalife Ltd. (HLF)  Herbalife shares
fell 7.1 percent in October after Ackman replaced his bearish
wager with put options, a move that deterred traders from
betting against the hedge-fund manager.  Other Pershing Square stakes rose last month, including
General Growth Properties Inc., which gained 10 percent, and
Burger King Worldwide Inc., which increased 8.5 percent.
Ackman’s firm almost halved its stake in General Growth, the
second-largest U.S. shopping mall owner said in a September
statement.  Canadian Pacific  Railway Ltd., among Pershing Square’s
biggest holdings, surged 16 percent in October after reporting
third-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. Pershing
Square cut its stake in Canadian Pacific by 7 million shares,
according to a filing last month.  Carolyn Sargent , a spokesman for Pershing Square with
Rubenstein Associates Inc., declined to comment on the investor
update.  To contact the reporter on this story:
