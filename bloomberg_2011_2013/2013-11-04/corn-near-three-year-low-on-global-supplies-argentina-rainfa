Corn futures slumped to the lowest
price in more than three years on speculation that a government
report this week will show increasing supplies in the U.S., the
world’s top grower. Soybeans gained, while wheat fell.  The corn crop may be a record 14.03 billion bushels, or 1.3
percent more than the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted
in September and 30 percent larger than in 2012, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 36 analysts. Inventories before the 2014
harvest may more than double to 2.04 billion bushels from a year
earlier, the survey showed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
will update its forecasts on Nov. 8.  “Prices are being more heavily influenced again by the
prospect of a high global corn surplus,”  Carsten Fritsch , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in a report. “This
is looking increasingly likely in view of positive U.S. harvest
results.”  Corn futures for December delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
close at $4.2625 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $4.2525, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Aug. 26, 2010.  On Nov. 1, INTL FCStone Inc. and Informa Economics Inc.
raised their estimates for U.S. production. A bigger U.S. crop
will spur a rebound in world stockpiles to 155.19 million metric
tons by the end of the 2013-2014 season, up from 122.59 million
a year earlier, Bloomberg’s survey showed.  Soybeans  Soybeans rose on increasing demand for U.S. exports, Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services
Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. The USDA
 inspected  80.6 million bushels for shipment in the week ended
Oct. 31, up 32 percent from a year earlier. “The demand for
U.S. soybeans is extraordinary,” Grow said.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$12.565 a bushel, after dropping 3.2 percent last week.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$6.6275 a bushel, after touching $6.62, the lowest since Sept.
