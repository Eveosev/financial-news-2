European stocks  rose to a five-year
high as HSBC Holdings Plc reported increased profit and
investors awaited this week’s interest-rate decision from the
 European Central Bank .  HSBC climbed the most in two months as Europe’s biggest
bank said pretax profit gained 30 percent. PostNL NV rallied 7.8
percent after the Dutch postal operator raised its income
guidance.  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  tumbled the most in five years
after cutting its earnings forecast amid higher competition and
a weaker economy. UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG fell.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.3 percent to 322.5 at
the close of trading, the highest since May 2008. The benchmark
measure climbed 0.4 percent last week, extending this year’s
rally to 15 percent, as companies from BP Plc to Alcatel-Lucent
SA posted results that exceeded analysts’ estimates and cooling
inflation fueled speculation the ECB will ease monetary policy.  “This is one of the busiest weeks for Europe in terms of
earnings,” Tobias Britsch, who helps oversee about $35 billion
at Meriten Investment Management GmbH, said by telephone from
Dusseldorf,  Germany . “Market movements are currently a mixture
of reporting season with decisions from central banks.”  National benchmark indexes rose in 14 of the 18 western
European markets this week. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 and  France ’s CAC
40 added 0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX gained 0.3 percent.  ECB Outlook  Bank of America Corp.,  UBS (UBSN)  and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc  forecast  the ECB will cut rates at the meeting on Thursday,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of 68 economists, with the
rest predicting no change. The ECB last lowered its benchmark
rate in May to a record 0.5 percent.  “Although the ECB meeting is still a few days away and
expectations are for no change on current policy, traders are
eagerly anticipating some form of dovish hint that looser
conditions are on the way,” Jonathan Sudaria, a trader at
Capital Spreads in London, wrote in e-mailed comments.  Traders have pushed futures tracking euro-area stock-market
volatility to the highest prices of the year. Three-month

and traded 32 percent above the gauge’s level on Oct. 25,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The VStoxx, which
tracks one-month volatility expectations for the Euro Stoxx 50
Index, is down 31 percent from its October high.  HSBC Results  HSBC rose 2.3 percent to 703 pence, the biggest gain since

excluding gains and losses in the value of the bank’s own debt,

highest price since March 2012. The company said it has cut
costs and boosted its forecast for full-year underlying cash
operating profit to 130 million euros ($175 million) to 160
million euros, compared with previous guidance of 50 million
euros to 90 million euros.  K+S AG soared 9.3 percent to 20.98 euros, the largest gain
since April 2009. Commerzbank AG upgraded  Europe ’s biggest
producer of potash to hold from reduce and HSBC raised the
shares to neutral from underweight. The stock has still plunged

francs, the lowest price since July, and Credit Suisse slid 6.7

Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said yesterday lenders
including UBS and Credit Suisse may have to pull out of
 investment banking  as she called for their leverage ratios to be
raised.  “Banks would have to consider whether to carry on with
investment banking or focus even more on asset management,”
Widmer-Schlumpf was quoted as saying in an interview with
Schweiz am Sonntag. Banks “must be organized in such a way that
the state isn’t ultimately held liable.”  Weir Group Plc declined 3.7 percent to 2,173 pence. The
U.K.’s biggest supplier of pressure pumps said in a statement
that third-quarter sales and earnings missed its forecasts
because of delivery delays in its minerals segment and a slower-than-anticipated recovery in the oil and gas markets.  Alcatel dropped 3.8 percent to 2.86 euros as the French
networking-equipment manufacturer said it is seeking 955 million
