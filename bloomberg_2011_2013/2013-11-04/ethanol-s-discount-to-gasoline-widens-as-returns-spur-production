Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
tightened on speculation that export demand is preventing the
highest production rates in 16 months from refilling stockpiles
of the gasoline additive.  The spread between December contracts narrowed 1.02 cents
to 88.62 cents a gallon as the most recent Energy Information
Administration data shows  stockpiles  declining and the pace of
foreign deliveries, as of August, at the highest since March.  “We have seen stockpiles hit a record low,” said Chris
Krukowski, an ethanol broker at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago.
“In general we are seeing tightness.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 0.7 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $1.642 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have fallen 21 percent this year. The November contract,
which expires tomorrow, slumped 5 cents to $1.72.  Gasoline for December delivery slipped 1.72 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.5282 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contact covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  rose 1.6 percent to 911,000 barrels a
day in the week ended Oct. 25, the most since June 2012,
according to data from the Energy Department’s statistical
agency. Stockpiles sank 3.5 percent to 15 million barrels, the
lowest level in more than three years of records.  The combination of rising output and falling supply
indicates more foreign demand, Krukowski said. Exports reached a
five-month high of 38,000 barrels a day in August, the EIA said
in an Oct. 30  report , and there were no imports in the four
weeks ended Oct. 25.  “Production is still ramping up, though exports are
heading out,” he said.  Corn Slips  Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S., with one
bushel making at least 2.75 gallons of the fuel.  Corn for December delivery slipped 1 cent to $4.2625 a
bushel in  Chicago , the lowest settlement since August 2010. The
corn crush spread, or the difference between the cost of corn
and the price of ethanol, based on December contracts, was 9
cents a gallon, down from 10 cents Nov. 1, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York was unchanged
at $2.035 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The price
fell 7 cents to $1.75 in Chicago, 7 cents to $1.83 on the  Gulf
Coast  and 3.5 cents to $1.84 on the West Coast.  The Gulf traded at a 1-cent discount to the West Coast,
from a 2.5-cent premium on Nov. 1, while Chicago’s discount to
 New York  stretched 7 cents to 28.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
