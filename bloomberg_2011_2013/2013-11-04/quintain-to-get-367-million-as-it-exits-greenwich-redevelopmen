Quintain Estates & Development Plc (QED) 
agreed to sell its remaining 40 percent stake in  London ’s
Greenwich Peninsula redevelopment project to Henry Cheng Kar-Shun’s Knight Dragon investment company.  Quintain will receive a total of 230 million pounds ($367
million), the company said today in a statement. Of that, 44
million pounds was owed by Knight Dragon following its July 2012
purchase of the other 60 percent of the development, close to
London’s Canary Wharf financial district.  The project will include as many as 10,000 homes as well as
shops, hotels and schools on the  River Thames . The deal adds to
an influx of Asian investment in London. Oxley Holdings Ltd., a
Singapore-based property developer, on Nov. 1 agreed to buy a
40-acre site in east London on which it plans to build 3,400
homes, the company said on Friday.  “Greenwich Peninsula represents a unique opportunity to
deliver one of the largest regeneration schemes in  Europe  and
Knight Dragon is fully committed to delivering this landmark
development for London,” Sammy Lee, director of Knight Dragon
said in the statement.  Malaysian companies SP Setia Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd and the
Employees Provident Fund, bought the landmark Battersea Power
Station, a derelict plant that’s also Europe’s largest brick
building, for 400 million pounds.  Quintain’s stake in Greenwich Penninsula represented about
20 percent of the company’s gross asset value, according to the
statement. As a result of the deal, the company’s net debt will
drop by 52 percent to 217.6 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
