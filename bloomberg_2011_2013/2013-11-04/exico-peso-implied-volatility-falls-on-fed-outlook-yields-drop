The Mexican peso’s implied volatility
dropped from a three-week high as investors speculated over when
the U.S. Federal Reserve will slow bond purchases that have
fueled demand for the Latin American country’s local-currency
debt.  Three-month implied volatility on options for the peso,
which reflect traders’ projections for price fluctuations, fell
to 11.5 percent at 10:16 a.m. in  Mexico  City, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge of currency swings climbed to
12.02 percent on Nov. 1, the highest since Oct. 11. The peso
appreciated 0.6 percent to 12.9787 per  U.S. dollar  today.  Expectations for price swings in the peso are declining as
investors are unsure of when the Fed will reduce the pace of its
$85 billion in monthly asset purchases, Eduardo Rodriguez, a
trader at Casa de Bolsa Finamex SAB, said in a telephone
interview from Guadalajara, Mexico. Investors “are waiting for
a stronger piece of news that’s more conclusive.”  Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher  said in an interview in
Sydney that he wouldn’t rule out backing a tapering of asset
purchases by March depending on economic conditions. The Fed
said last week that it needs to see more evidence that the
world’s largest economy will sustain its recovery.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds maturing in 2024 declined
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.96 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The drop is the biggest
on a closing basis since Oct. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
