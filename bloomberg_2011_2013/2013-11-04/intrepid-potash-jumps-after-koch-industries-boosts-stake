Intrepid Potash Inc. (IPI)  rose the most in
two years after Koch Industries Inc., the holding company
controlled by the billionaire Koch brothers, increased its stake
in the potash miner to 6.9 percent.  Intrepid rose 11 percent to $15.75 at the close in New
York, the most since August 2011.  Koch Industries, owned by  Charles Koch  and  David Koch , said
today in a filing that it held 5.2 million Intrepid shares as of
Sept 30. That means Wichita, Kansas-based Koch Industries is the
fourth-biggest Intrepid investor, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In August, Spring Capital LLC, which is owned Koch
Industries, said in a filing it held 4.13 million Intrepid
shares.  Intrepid which is based in Denver, produces potash in New
Mexico and Utah, according to its website. Closely held Koch
Industriesâ€™  Koch Fertilizer LLC  sells potash and nitrogen-based
fertilizers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
