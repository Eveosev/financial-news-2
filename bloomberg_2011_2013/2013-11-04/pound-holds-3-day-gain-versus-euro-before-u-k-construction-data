The pound strengthened the most in
more than a week versus the dollar after a report showed U.K.
construction output accelerated in October to the fastest pace
in six years, adding to evidence the recovery is gathering pace.  Sterling snapped three days of gains versus the euro, after
climbing last week amid speculation the  European Central Bank 
will cut interest rates to revive growth. Britain’s currency
last week slid the most versus the dollar since July as signs
the  U.S. economy  is improving fueled bets the  Federal Reserve 
will begin tapering stimulus that tends to weaken the greenback.
U.K. government bonds rose for the first time in three days.  “The data is suggesting that the economy is about as good
as it can get,” said  Gavin Friend , a currency strategist at
National Australia Bank Ltd. in London. “The U.K. is looking
better than  Europe  and the U.S. There’s not much further it can
go. We should see a renewed downward focus on the euro against
sterling because people are starting to think about the growth
divergence.”  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.5955 at 4:41 p.m.
London time, after declining 1.5 percent last week, the steepest
drop since the period ended July 5. Sterling was little changed
at 84.74 pence per euro. It climbed 0.8 percent last week, the
biggest gain since Sept. 27.  Growth Accelerated  An index of construction activity, based on a survey of
 purchasing managers , rose to 59.4 in October from 58.9 in
September, Markit Economics said today in London. The median
forecast of 15 economists was for a decline to 58.7. The gauge
has been above the 50 level that divides expansion from
contraction since May.  U.K economic growth  accelerated to the fastest in more than
three years in the third quarter as the recovery continued
across all main industries. The  Confederation of British
Industry  raised its forecasts for the economy yesterday and now
sees expansion of 1.4 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 2014.
That’s up from 1.2 percent and 2.3 percent in August.  The pound gained 0.8 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar rose 2.9 percent and the
euro climbed 5.7 percent.  Bank of England  policy makers meeting on Nov. 7 will leave
the key  interest rate  at 0.5 percent and the asset-purchase
target at 375 billion pounds, according to Bloomberg surveys of
economists.  The ECB will announce a cut in its main refinancing rate to
a record-low 0.25 percent on Thursday, according to Bank of
America Corp., UBS AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.
Theirs were among 68 analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg
News . The remainder expect the rate to remain at 0.5 percent.  Diverging Outlook  “The diverging cyclical outlook for the ECB and the BOE
should continue to weigh on” the euro versus the pound,
 Valentin Marinov , head of European Group-of-10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Citigroup Inc. in London wrote in a note to clients.
“We think that sterling could regain more ground against the
euro.”  While Citigroup forecasts the ECB will leave its key rate
unchanged, it sees a risk of more policy measures as soon as
December, Marinov wrote.  The U.K.  10-year gilt  yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.63 percent. The rate declined to 2.52
percent on Oct. 31, the lowest since Aug. 13. The 2.25 percent
bond due in September 2023 rose 0.175, or 1.75 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 96.755.  The U.K. debt management office plans to sell 1.25 billion
pounds of 0.25 percent inflation-linked bonds due in March 2052
at an auction tomorrow.  Ultra-Long Linker  “This auction size is very large for an ultra-long
linker,” Henry Skeoch, a strategist at Barclays Plc in  London 
wrote in a note to clients. “We think that some additional
concession pre-supply is possible, though we expect the auction
itself to be fairly well received.”  The yield on inflation-linked bonds maturing in March 2052
was little changed at 0.02 percent. The rate was as low as minus
0.04 percent on Oct. 23.  The Debt Management Office needs to sell 9.3 billion pounds
of inflation-linked bonds at auctions and 4.1 billion pounds
through banks before the end of the fiscal year on March 31 to
meet its planned issuance, Skeoch wrote.  U.K. government bonds lost 2.5 percent this year through
Nov. 1, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries
slid 2.2 percent and German bonds declined 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
