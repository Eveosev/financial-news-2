Poland may raise about $700 million
from selling a stake in Energa SA, the last state-owned Polish
power utility to hold an initial public offering, according to
the sale terms obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The government plans to offer a 34.2 percent stake in the
Gdansk-based company, Energa said in an e-mailed statement
today. The transaction will take place this year and the
proceeds will help finance the budget gap and curb debt growth,
Deputy Treasury Minister Pawel Tamborski said on Oct. 23.  The IPO would be the biggest in central  Europe  since Polish
coal producer Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA’s 5.37 billion-zloty
($1.74 billion) sale in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Over the last five years, Poland sold stakes in
Energa’s competitors including PGE SA, Tauron Polska Energia SA,
Enea SA and PAK SA, raising a total of 12.9 billion zloty from
their IPOs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This is yet another power utility to debut on the Warsaw
bourse and it must offer an attractive valuation and business
model to draw a wide interest from investors, particularly after
a bunch of offerings we recently had in the region,” Rafal Janczyk, who helps manage the equivalent of $3.9 billion at
Aviva Investors  Poland  SA in Warsaw, said by phone today.  Share Sales  Poland’s state railway sold a 1.42 billion zloty stake in
its cargo unit’s IPO last month while  Romania ’s government
raised 1.7 billion lei ($517 million) from natural-gas producer
Romgaz SA’s offering. Uniqa Insurance Group AG,  Austria ’s
second-biggest insurer, sold 757 million euros ($1 billion) of
new shares to quicken growth in eastern Europe in October.  Energa, which makes most of its profit from a regulated
power-distribution business, boosted nine-month earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization 13 percent to 1.5
billion zloty, it said in a  filing  on Oct. 25. Net income rose
15 percent from a year earlier to 610.8 million zloty.  In 2012, full-year profit fell 31 percent to 457 million
zloty while Ebitda climbed 11 percent to 1.63 billion zloty.  PGE, Poland’s biggest electricity producer, has declined 19
percent since its IPO in 2009, Tauron shares trade 2.9 percent
below the company’s 2010 offering, while Enea’s stock price is
4.9 percent below its first sale in 2008 as earnings worsened
amid a slump in  electricity prices . PAK, controlled by Polish
billionaire Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, has climbed 7.3 percent since
the government sold its remaining 50 percent last year.  Expansion Plans  PGE is currently  valued  at 9.9 times this year’s profit,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tauron, the second-biggest power utility, trades at 6.3 times this year’s profit,
while Enea 10.3 times earnings.  Earlier this year Energa, which operates the country’s
biggest hydroelectric plant in Wloclawek, bought 165 megawatt of
wind farms from Dong Energy A/S and Iberdrola SA, raising its
total renewable energy capacity to 508 megawatts, or 40 percent
of its portfolio. The company  plans to spend  19.7 billion zloty
through 2021, with 12.5 billion zloty of that amount earmarked
for investments in power distribution.  The Treasury Ministry first  tried to sell Energa  in 2010.
The 7.5 billion-zloty sale of an 84.2 percent stake to PGE was
blocked by Poland’s antitrust regulator.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG will act as joint global
coordinators and joint bookrunners of the IPO. Citigroup Inc.,
PKO Bank Polski SA, UniCredit SpA, Banco Espirito Santo
Investments, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Ipopema Securities
SA, BRE Bank SA, Bank Ochrony Srodowiska SA and Alior Bank SA
will also help manage the sale, according to Energa’s statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
