Carnegie Wave Energy Ltd. (CWE)  awarded a
contract to build a desalination pilot plant in Australia
expected to produce both power and freshwater from the ocean’s
waves for the first time.  The plant, backed by A$1.3 million ($1.2 million) in
Australian government funding, will have the capacity to supply
as much as a third of the water needs of the nation’s largest
naval base, located on Garden Island in  Western Australia ,
Perth-based Carnegie said today in a statement.  The desalination facility will be manufactured by Perth-based Mak Water Industrial, Carnegie said. Construction is
scheduled to be completed in the first half of next year,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
