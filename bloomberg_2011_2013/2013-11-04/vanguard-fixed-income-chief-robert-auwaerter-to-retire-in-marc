Vanguard Group Inc., the world’s
biggest mutual-fund company, said Robert F. Auwaerter, 58, will
retire as head of its fixed-income division after leading it for
a decade.  Gregory Davis, 43, chief investment officer for the Asia
Pacific region and a director of the firm’s Australia unit, will
succeed Auwaerter, the  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania-based company
said today in a statement. Vanguard, known for its index-tracking products, oversees about $750 billion in bonds,
including $450 billion in actively managed funds.  “Greg brings experience, skill, and strong leadership
competencies to his new position,” Tim Buckley, Vanguard’s
chief investment officer, said in the statement.  Vanguard runs most of its fixed-income assets internally,
while sub-contracting with outside managers to run most of its
actively-managed equity funds. The firm brought much of its
active bond investing inhouse in 1981, the year Auwaerter joined
the firm.  Davis, a graduate of the  University of Pennsylvania ’s
Wharton School, was previously a senior portfolio manager and
head of bond indexing. He worked at Merrill Lynch as an
associate in global debt markets before joining Vanguard in
1999.  Vanguard managed $2.4 trillion in U.S. mutual fund and
exchange-traded fund assets, as of Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
