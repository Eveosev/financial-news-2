G4S Plc (GFS)  faces criminal investigation
by the U.K. Serious Fraud Office over allegations the security
and guarding provider overcharged the government for electronic
monitoring services, including billing for dead people.  Shares in the world’s biggest provider of security services
 fell  as much as 2.6 percent and were down 1.8 percent to 250
pence at 11:38 a.m. in London after the SFO confirmed it will
probe claims made by the Justice Ministry in July that G4S
overcharged for the electronic monitoring of prisoners.  Serco
Group Plc (SRP)  will also be investigated.  “G4S has confirmed to the SFO that it will cooperate fully
with the investigation,” the Crawley, England-based company
said in a statement.  The investigation is the latest in a series of blows to
G4S’s reputation since the company bungled a contract to provide
guards last year for the  London  Olympics. Britain’s government
has said it may exclude the company from tendering for future
tagging contracts. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said July 11
G4S overcharged for the tagging of offenders, including billing
for dead people.  G4S replaced its chief executive officer last year,
following the Olympic scandal, and its U.K. chief last month
amid the Justice Ministry allegations. The company is due to
release a trading and strategy update tomorrow.  Serco CEO Christopher Hyman resigned on Oct. 25 following
the claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
