European Union carbon permits fell to
their lowest close since Sept. 3, even after  Lithuania  said
nations in the 28-member bloc would this week give the go-ahead
for talks on a proposal to help boost emission prices.  Front-year allowances earlier advanced as much as 4.3
percent to 4.82 euros ($6.51) a metric ton after an official
from Lithuania, which holds the EU rotating presidency through
the end of the year, said countries were “almost certain” to
approve talks on the plan to ease a surplus by delaying auctions
of some emissions allowances. Germany, the region’s largest
emitter, has yet to reach a position on the proposal known as
backloading.  “Germany has not given any sign that it will reach a
decision on its position on backloading this week, even though
talks on the proposal seem set to go ahead,” Krzysztof Piatek,
a trader at Vertis Environmental Finance Plc in Budapest, said
by e-mail. “Until  Germany  comes out with a clear view, the
market is set to follow bearish fundamentals.”  Permits closed lower for a fourth day, falling 1.3 percent
to 4.56 euros a ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe.  Prices fell to a record 2.46 euros a ton in April as an
oversupply of EU allowances swelled to 1.8 billion tons,
according to the European Commission, the bloc’s regulator. The
emergency fix, which was drafted by the commission and amended
by the European Parliament in July, still needs parliamentary
approval and qualified majority support from member states to be
enacted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
