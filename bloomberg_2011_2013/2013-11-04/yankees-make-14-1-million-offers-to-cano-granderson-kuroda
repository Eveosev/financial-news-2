The  New York  Yankees made so-called
qualifying offers of $14.1 million to second baseman Robinson
Cano, outfielder Curtis Granderson and pitcher Hideki Kuroda,
the team said in an e-mail.  By making the offers to the free-agent players, the Yankees
would get compensation draft picks at the end of the first round
if the players sign with another team.  The $14.1 million figure is the average of the 125 richest
player contracts in Major League Baseball, under terms of the
sportâ€™s labor agreement with its players union.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
