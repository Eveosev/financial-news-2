Standard & Poor’s parent  McGraw Hill
Financial Inc. (MHFI)  and  Moody’s (MCO)  Corp. are recouping losses from the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression as shares of
the companies flirt with record highs amid surging demand for
corporate-debt ratings.  McGraw Hill, owner of the largest credit grader, rose 0.3
percent to $71.32 today, needing to increase 0.9 percent to
reach its all-time closing high of $71.96 in June 2007. Moody’s,
the second-largest rater, climbed 1.7 percent to $72.42, 3.3
percent away from its end-of-day peak of $74.84 in February
2007. Shares of both companies will surpass those peaks, with
McGraw Hill  rising  to $76.40 and Moody’s  climbing  to $76.50 in
the next 12 months, according to the average estimates of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The credit-ratings firms, both based in  New York , have
rebounded as companies take advantage of Federal Reserve
monetary policies that have funneled more than $3 trillion into
the financial system while keeping the central bank’s benchmark
lending rate at almost zero since December 2008.  McGraw Hill, which touched an intraday record high of
$74.37 on Oct. 24, traded as low as $17.15 in October 2008.
Moody’s, which reached an intraday peak of $73.90 on Oct. 22,
traded as low as $15.41 in November 2008.  With companies raising a record $4 trillion globally last
year, corporate-finance grades made up 33 percent of ratings
revenue at Moody’s in the third quarter, up from 16.5 percent at
the end of 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. S&P
doesn’t break out its ratings segments.  Borrowing costs for the most creditworthy to the riskiest
investors have averaged 3.47 percent this year, below the 10-year average of 5.06 percent, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch Global Corporate & High Yield index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
