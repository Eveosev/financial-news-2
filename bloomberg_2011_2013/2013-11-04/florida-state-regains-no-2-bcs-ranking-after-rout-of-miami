Florida State University regained the
No. 2 spot in college football’s Bowl Championship Series
standings behind top-ranked  Alabama  after a 41-14 rout of
previously-undefeated Miami.  Florida State was second in the initial BCS standings two
weeks ago and was overtaken by the University of Oregon in last
week’s rankings following the Ducks’ 42-14 win over UCLA.  FSU moved past Oregon this week after outscoring Miami 20-0
in the second half to improve to 8-0 for the first time since
1999, when the Seminoles won the national championship.  Alabama (8-0) has a  .980 rating  out of 1.000 in the BCS
standings, which determine the two teams to play for the
national championship on Jan. 6 in  Pasadena ,  California . Florida
State is at .953, followed by Oregon (8-0) at .944.  Oregon  will get a chance to move past Florida State again
as the Ducks visit fifth-ranked Stanford (7-1) on Nov. 7.  Florida State next plays Wake Forest (4-5) on Nov. 9, when
two-time defending national champion Alabama hosts 13th-ranked
Louisiana State (7-2).  Ohio State (9-0) is ranked fourth in the BCS standings,
which are determined by the Harris Interactive Poll, the USA
Today coaches’ poll and an average of six computer polls.
Stanford, Baylor (7-0), Clemson (8-1), Missouri (8-1), Auburn
(8-1) and Oklahoma (7-1) round out the top 10. Miami (7-1) fell
to 11th from seventh with its loss at Florida State.  To contact the reporter on this story:
