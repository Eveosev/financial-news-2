Temperatures in the eastern U.S. are
expected to rise above normal by mid-November, and that may
signal a mild end to the month, said  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Readings from the Great Plains to the mid-Atlantic states
will be about 3 degrees Fahrenheit (2 Celsius) above normal from
Nov. 14 to Nov. 18, according to Rogers, who’s based in
Bethesda,  Maryland . An area stretching from the  Great Lakes  to
Louisiana, including St. Louis, is expected to have temperatures
5 degrees above normal.  Much of the Northeast will be seasonal during the period.  “The warmest focus seems to be for the South to Midwest
first, but expansion toward the East Coast is seen by later in
the period, too, with potential for this to dominate the second
half of November now,” Rogers said.  Colder weather, especially in Eastern and Midwestern
cities, tends to increase energy consumption as more people heat
homes and businesses. November marks the start of the U.S.
heating season, when natural gas demand peaks.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas use,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. About 49 percent of all homes use
the fuel for heating.  The normal average temperature in New York on Nov. 13 is
about 49 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In  Boston , it’s 45; in  St. Louis , 48;
Dallas, 57; Houston, 63; Chicago, 45; Burbank, California, 61;
and in Calgary, it’s 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
