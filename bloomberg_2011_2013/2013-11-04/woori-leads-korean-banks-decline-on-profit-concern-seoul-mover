Woori Finance Holdings Co. (053000)  shares
fell to the lowest level in more than three weeks, leading
declines among South Korean financial companies, after it
reported earnings that missed estimates.  Seoul-based Woori, South Korea’s largest financial group by
assets, sank 2.8 percent to 12,000 won, the lowest intraday
price since Oct. 10 as of 10:17 a.m. local time. The benchmark
Kospi Index lost 0.6 percent. Shinhan Financial Group Co. and
Hana Financial Group Inc. dropped more than 3 percent.  Woori’s third-quarter  profit  dropped 84 percent from a year
earlier to 86.4 billion won ($81 million), the company reported
on Nov. 1 after the market closed, missing the 315.5 billion-won
average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Provisions against bad debt nearly tripled from a year earlier
due to the failure of companies including STX Group, Woori said.  “Woori’s earnings shock from higher provisions made
investors worried about bank earnings for the fourth quarter,”
Yoo Sang Ho, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co., said
by phone today.  The Kospi Finance Index, which tracks 51 stocks including
banking groups, lost 1.8 percent, the most since Aug. 22. The
gauge gained 4.7 percent this year, compared with the broader
Kospi’s 1.6 percent increase.  South Korea is selling Woori Finance’s businesses in three
batches as part of the government’s fourth attempt to privatize
the company since 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
