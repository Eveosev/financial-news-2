Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD) , the
energy explorer whose shares have doubled in value this year,
said third-quarter profit more than quadrupled as output
increased and  oil prices  rose.  Net income increased to $91.1 million, or 65 cents a share,
from $19.2 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier, the company
said in a statement today. Excluding one-time items, per-share
earnings were below the $1.35 average of 38  analysts’ estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Pioneer was among the 10 largest holders of net acreage in
the Permian Basin in  Texas  at the end of the second quarter,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Irving, Texas-based
company has estimated its 640,000 net acres in the Permian --
including the Spraberry and Wolfcamp areas -- will yield the
equivalent of more than 7 billion barrels of oil.  Average sales volumes during the third quarter increased to
the equivalent of 172,611 barrels of oil a day from 159,894
barrels a year earlier, based on continuing operations. That’s
“slightly below” the company’s guidance for the quarter,
Pioneer said.  The failure to meet the output estimate was “a result of
delays in bringing new wells on production in the Eagle Ford
Shale related to increased pad drilling,” Scott Sheffield,
chairman and chief executive officer of Pioneer, said in the
statement. “We expect fourth-quarter production to grow
significantly as these delayed wells and a substantial number of
new pad wells from the Eagle Ford Shale and the
Spraberry/Wolfcamp areas are placed on production.”  Oil Prices  Oil futures traded in  New York  rose 15 percent from a year
earlier to average $105.81 a barrel in the third quarter. Gas
futures traded in New York averaged $3.555 per million British
thermal units in the quarter, a 23 percent rise from a year
earlier.  Pioneer agreed to sell its Alaska unit to Caelus Energy
Alaska LLC for $550 million in cash in October and will redeploy
capital to its Permian assets.  The earnings were released after the close of regular
trading in New York. The shares, which have 27 buy, nine hold
and three sell recommendations, from analysts, rose 4 percent to
$213.41 at 4:03 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
