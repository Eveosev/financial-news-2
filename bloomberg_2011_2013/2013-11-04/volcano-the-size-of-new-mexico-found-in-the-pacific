The oceans are mysterious. Who knows what could be tucked away down there? An 18-foot oarfish showed up on the island of Catalina the other day, so big that it took 16 people to carry it ashore. But of all the things that could have been hiding at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, few guessed that “a volcano the size of New Mexico” was on the list—until last month. How do you miss a volcano the size of New Mexico? For decades, scientists have known about the Shatsky Rise, a ridge of three undersea mountains whose summits lie more than a mile under the Pacific waves. But recently, a team of geologists has been taking a closer look at the peaks. By shooting seismic waves into the rock with air guns, they've determined that the largest peak wasn't formed from a series of volcanoes, like Hawaii or Iceland was. Instead, the whole mountain flowed out of the same magma vent. This means that Tamu Massif is a single shield volcano—by far the largest one on Earth. It's roughly the same area as Olympus Mons, a Martian volcano so huge that amateur astronomers can see it through telescopes on a clear night. Though it's not nearly as tall as Olympus Mons, Tamu Massif has an area as large as any volcano in the solar system. Could Tamu Massif someday be bumped into second place by an even bigger submarine volcano? Its discoverers say yes. There are lots of other igneous features under the Pacific Ocean, like the Ontong Java Plateau, a lump of solidified lava the size of Alaska sitting off the north coast of the Solomon Islands. But we don't know yet if the plateau was formed by lots of volcanoes, or just one gigantic one. Tamu Massif sits about 1,000 miles east of Japan, and you'd be forgiven for thinking that "Tamu" is a Japanese name, the way it might sound. Nope! Tamu is an acronym—its discoverer named it for Texas A&M University, where he was a professor for nearly three decades. I guess it's true: Texas stuff is bigger. More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
