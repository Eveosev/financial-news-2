The Ibovespa climbed the most in a
week as  Vale SA (VALE5)  rallied amid signs that growth is accelerating
in  China , the mining company’s top export market.  Duratex SA, a maker of wood panels and metal fixtures
including faucets, was the best performer on the MSCI
 Brazil /Materials Index, which rose to the highest since May.
Meatpacker Minerva SA climbed to a one-month high after agreeing
to buy two beef plants from  BRF SA (BRFS3) , which will hold a 15 percent
stake in the company once the deal is completed.  The Ibovespa gained 0.8 percent to 54,436.92 at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo, with 39 stocks higher and 30 lower. The
real climbed 0.3 percent to 2.2465 per dollar at 6:12 p.m. local
time. In China, a purchasing managers’ index increased in
October to the highest level this year.  “The Ibovespa could rise to 60,000 by the end of the
year,”  Pedro Galdi , the head strategist at SLW Corretora in Sao
Paulo, said in a telephone interview. “There are signs that the
global economy is improving, and equities should respond to
that. Demand in China remains strong, which bolsters stocks such
as Vale.”  Vale contributed the most to the benchmark gauge’s advance,
gaining 2.3 percent to 34.22 reais, the highest since March.
Bradespar SA, Banco Bradesco SA’s investment unit and part of
Vale’s controlling group, rose 2 percent to 26.58 reais. China’s
non-manufacturing PMI increased to 56.3 in October from 55.4 in
September, the country’s National Bureau of Statistics and its
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said. A number above 50
indicates expansion.  Minerva Acquisition  Minerva advanced 2 percent to 10.10 reais. The plants
acquired from BRF are in Mato Grosso, which processes more
cattle than any other Brazilian state, according to data
compiled by Abiec, the Brazilian meat exporters’ association.  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  sank 1.3 percent to 16.53 reais after the Wall
Street Journal reported that the plane builder is being
investigated in the U.S. and Brazil for allegedly bribing
Dominican Republic officials to win a $90 million contract.
Embraer said in e-mailed statement to  Bloomberg News  that it
requires employees to comply with laws and it has been
cooperating fully with authorities.  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) , a manufacturer of consumer products
including diapers and generic drugs, added 1.4 percent to 19.91
reais after its third-quarter profit exceeded analysts’
estimates. The company posted adjusted net income of 79.6
million reais, which compares with an average estimate of 71
million reais, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Duratex gained 3.5 percent to 14.07 reais.  Bull Market  EZ Tec Empreendimentos e Participacoes SA  lost 1.3 percent
to 31.51 reais after Banco Santander SA cut its recommendation
on the homebuilder to hold.  Brazil’s benchmark stock index entered a  bull market  Sept.
9 after rising 20 percent from this year’s low on July 3. The
gauge is still down 19 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 2.7 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 6.14 billion
reais today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.61 billion reais this year
through Oct. 22, according to the latest data available from the
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
