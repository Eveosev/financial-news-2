Greenhouse-gas emissions from power
generators, oil refineries and other plants in  California 
climbed in 2012 as a nuclear plant shutdown and low hydropower
supplies increased the state’s reliance on natural gas.  Power-plant releases rose 35 percent to 41.6 million metric
tons last year, according to  data  posted today on the state Air
Resources Board’s website. Total emissions were 437.8 million
metric tons, up from 429.3 million in 2011.  Edison International (EIX) 
shut the San Onofre nuclear power plant in  Southern California 
in January 2012, and the state that year faced one of the  lowest
snowpack levels  on record.  “The rise in total emissions is primarily due to emission
increases from California electricity generation using natural
gas as a fuel,” the board said. “The majority of this
additional natural-gas electricity generation is due to a
decrease in available hydroelectric generation for 2012 and a
reduction in nuclear generated power.”  More than 700 companies, including fuel suppliers and
electric power importers, must report their emissions as part of
a cap-and-trade program designed to cut greenhouse-gas pollution
in California, the world’s ninth-largest economy, to 1990 levels
by 2020. The program established the world’s second-largest
carbon market, in which polluters trade permits that allow them
to release carbon dioxide.  Market Unchanged  Futures contracts based on California carbon allowances,
each permitting the release of a metric ton of carbon as early
as this year, climbed 10 cents on Nov. 1 to $12.10 a metric ton,
data compiled by Chicago-based  CME Group Inc. (CME)  show. Prices have
dropped 20 percent this year on speculation that the market will
be oversupplied until at least 2017.  “More than 200,000 tons traded today on the emissions
reporting news, but the market is unchanged from the Friday
closing price of $12.10,” broker Environmental Markets Inc.,
based in  White Plains ,  New York , said in a note on its website.  Emissions were up last year as 100 more plants fell under
the state’s greenhouse-gas reporting rules, the state air board
said.  Refineries and hydrogen plants released 33.8 million metric
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, down from 34.2 million a year
earlier. Oil and gas production accounted for 15.2 million tons,
up from 14.6 million in 2011.  Emissions from electricity imports and fuel suppliers
slipped 1.5 percent to 314.6 million metric tons.  Under California’s cap-and-trade program, the state issues
a set number of allowances through a combination of free
allocations and quarterly auctions. The pool of allowances
shrinks over time in order to cut emissions about 15 percent by
2020. Companies with more permits than they need to cover
releases can sell them to those that are short.  To contact the reporter on this story:
