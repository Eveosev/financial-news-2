Robusta coffee gained for a second
day in London on speculation a storm this week will reach
growing areas in  Vietnam , the world’s largest producer of the
variety. Cocoa declined.  Southern parts of Vietnam could get rains and wind
associated with a developing tropical system tomorrow and the
day after, AccuWeather said in a report today. Isolated showers
totaling 0.1 inch to 0.25 inch will fall today in northern
regions, the forecaster said. Vietnam is harvesting its 2013-14
crop, set to be a record 29 million bags of 60 kilograms (132
pounds) each, estimates Macquarie Group Ltd.  “While there’s a chance of this storm disrupting coffee
areas, the chances of damage are small,” Toby Donovan, a broker
at BGC Partners LLC in London, said by e-mail today. “However,
the storm will have to be followed closely.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in January added 0.3 percent to
$1,494 a metric ton by 11:39 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . The
beans slid 22 percent this year as traders anticipated an ample
Vietnamese crop. Arabica coffee for delivery in December rose
0.1 percent to $1.0565 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Robusta stockpiles with a valid grading certificate in
warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe fell 5.6 percent to 53,020
tons on Oct. 28 from two weeks earlier, according to data on the
exchange’s website. A Bloomberg survey of 10 traders predicted
in August that reserves would drop to 52,000 tons before the end
of the year, the lowest level since 2000.  Futures may slide to $1,300 a ton in London, Rodrigo Costa,
a trading director at Caturra Coffee Corp., said in an e-mailed
report for Archer Consulting, where he is a contributor. Costa
cited robusta prices that remain above production costs and a
stronger dollar. Arabica might reach 90 cents to 95 cents a
pound, he said, without giving a time frame.  Cocoa for delivery in March fell 0.5 percent to 1,693
pounds ($2,702) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for delivery in
December lost 0.1 percent to $2,649 a ton on ICE.  Refined, or white, sugar for delivery in March slid 0.2
percent to $484.90 a ton in London, poised for a sixth straight
decline. Raw sugar for the same delivery month rose 0.1 percent
to 18.27 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
