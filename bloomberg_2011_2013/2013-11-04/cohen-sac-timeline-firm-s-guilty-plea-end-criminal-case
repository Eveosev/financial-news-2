Billionaire  Steven Cohen ’s SAC
Capital Advisors LP, the hedge-fund firm accused of fostering a
culture of rampant insider trading, has agreed to plead guilty
to federal charges and pay $1.8 billion.  Cohen, who wasn’t charged criminally, faces an
administrative action filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for his alleged failure to supervise the hedge fund’s
activities. Here is a timeline of Cohen and his firm:  1977: Cohen graduates from  University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton
School with a bachelor’s degree in economics, then joins New
York-based brokerage Gruntal & Co.  1992: Cohen leaves Gruntal to start SAC Capital with $25 million
and nine employees. Marries second wife, Alexandra.  1998: Cohen buys Greenwich,  Connecticut , mansion for $14.8
million.  1999: SAC assets under management exceed $1 billion.  2000: SAC posts a 73 percent return, its highest ever.  2001: SAC assets reach $3.6 billion. Firm starts Sigma Capital
Management unit in  New York . At least three former and current
SAC employees linked to insider trading have worked at the unit.  2004: SAC starts CR Intrinsic Investors unit. At least three
former SAC employees linked to insider trading worked at the
unit.  2007: SAC assets peak at about $16.5 billion.  2008: SAC posts first annual loss of 19 percent amid global
financial crisis.  October 2009: Billionaire hedge-fund manager  Raj Rajaratnam  of
Galleon Group LLC is arrested on insider-trading charges. Former
SAC employee Richard Choo-Beng Lee pleads guilty to conspiracy
to commit securities fraud tied to the probe of Galleon.  January 2010: Former SAC analyst Jonathan Hollander is the first
employee to be named in an insider-trading case, accused in an
SEC lawsuit over transactions in his own account. He settles
with the agency in April 2011, paying a fine without admitting
or denying wrongdoing.  November 2010: Hedge-fund firms including Diamondback Capital
Management LLC and Level Global Investors LP, run by SAC alumni,
are raided by the FBI. SAC receives government subpoena for
documents.  February 2011: Former SAC money managers Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil are charged in insider-trading case. Freeman, who has
pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors, had told
investigators in December 2010 that it was “understood” by SAC
money managers that providing Cohen with one’s best trading
ideas involved providing him with inside information. Longueuil
later pleads guilty and is sentenced to 30 months in prison.  January 2012: Former technology analyst Jon Horvath is arrested
on charges of  securities fraud . He later pleads guilty and is
cooperating with the government.  February 2012: Cohen buys stake in  Major League Baseball ’s  New
York Mets .  July 2012: Wesley Wang, a former SAC analyst pleads guilty to
securities fraud. He admits to passing on tips to former money
manager Dipak Patel, who wasn’t charged. Wang is later sentenced
to two years’ probation after cooperation with the government’s
investigation.  September 2012: Long-serving SAC employee Michael Steinberg is
named as an unindicted co-conspirator. Steinberg is put on leave
at the firm.  November 2012: Former SAC money manager Mathew Martoma is
arrested in what prosecutors call the biggest insider-trading
case they have uncovered. The case links Cohen to the probe for
the first time. Martoma later pleads not guilty and is scheduled
to go on trial in January 2014. SAC receives Wells notice, a
warning that it may be sued by the SEC.  January 2013: SAC assets at $15 billion.  February 2013: SAC clients, including Citigroup Inc.’s private
bank and Societe Generale SA’s Lyxor Asset Management unit,
start exiting, pulling $1.68 billion. Cohen increases bonuses to
help retain employees.  March 15, 2013: SAC settles with SEC, agreeing to pay $616
million. The firm says the accord is a “substantial step toward
resolving all outstanding regulatory matters and allows the firm
to move forward with confidence,” and that it is “committed to
continuing to maintain a first-rate compliance effort woven into
the fabric of the firm.” A judge has signed off on the accord,
pending approval of a separate case unrelated to SAC.  March 2013: Cohen buys  Pablo Picasso ’s “Le Reve” for $155
million from casino owner  Steve Wynn , purchases $60 million
oceanfront property in  East Hampton ,  Long Island , and puts
Manhattan penthouse on sale for $115 million.  March 29, 2013: Steinberg is arrested and charged in insider-trading probe. He pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go on
trial on Nov. 18.  May 17, 2013: SAC tells clients it will no longer cooperate
unconditionally with the government. Several SAC executives
receive subpoenas.  July 19, 2013: The SEC accuses Cohen of failing to supervise
former health-care money managers Martoma and Steinberg. SAC
says Cohen acted “appropriately at all times and will fight
this charge vigorously.”  July 23, 2013: Former SAC money manager Richard Lee secretly
pleads guilty to insider-trading charges and is cooperating with
the government.  July 25, 2013: U.S. indicts SAC, accusing it of engaging in an
unprecedented  insider-trading  scheme for more than a decade and
describing the firm as a “veritable magnet for market
cheaters.” SAC says it has never “encouraged, promoted or
tolerated insider trading and takes its compliance and
management obligations seriously.” Cohen vows to keep the
business open.  August 2013: SAC executives expect the firm to manage $9 billion
at the start of 2014 after client redemptions.  Nov. 4, 2013: SAC agrees to plead guilty to insider-trading
charges, pay $1.8 billion and shut its investment-advisory
business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
