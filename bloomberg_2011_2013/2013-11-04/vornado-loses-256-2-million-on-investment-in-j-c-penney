Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)  lost a total of
$256.2 million over the course of its three-year investment in
the J.C. Penney Co. department store chain, the company said
today in a regulatory filing.  The New York-based real estate investment trust sold its
last shares of J.C Penney on Sept. 19, recognizing an $18.1
million loss, according to its quarterly earnings report.
Vornado Chairman  Steven Roth  had joined co-investor  Bill Ackman 
in a failed attempt to revitalize the retailer.  Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management LP took an
initial stake of 16.5 percent in the Plano, Texas-based
retailer, and Vornado had an original investment of 9.9 percent.
Both joined the J.C. Penney board in early 2011 and pushed
through a plan to transform the chain’s merchandising, pricing
and store layouts. Instead, established customers fled and the
stores failed to attract enough new ones.  Vornado analysts including Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler
O’Neill & Co. urged the REIT to sell its J.C. Penney investment,
even if it meant recording losses, and focus on New York and
Washington office buildings and urban retail properties. As of
Sept. 30, Vornado had a 32.6 percent stake in retailer Toys
“R” Us Inc., which Goldfarb and others have said Vornado
should sell.  The REIT has said it plans to simplify its holdings.
Earlier this year, Toys “R” Us withdrew plans for an initial
public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
