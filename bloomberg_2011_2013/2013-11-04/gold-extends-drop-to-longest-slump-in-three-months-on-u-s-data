Gold futures pared gains as the rally
in U.S. equities damped demand for the metal as an alternative
investment. Platinum advanced on South African supply concerns
amid labor turmoil.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose as much as 0.3
percent. The gauge climbed to a record last week. Earlier, gold
gained as much as 0.7 percent as the  dollar  snapped the longest
rally since May against a basket of 10 currencies. Federal
Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said he wouldn’t
rule out backing a tapering of the central bank’s debt purchases
by March.  “The buoyant stock market and the comment from Fischer are
putting pressure on gold,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The
weakness in the dollar is supporting gold, helping it remain in
positive territory.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to
