Fortiz Private Equity Fund Ltd. will
list  Merchant Bank Ghana Ltd.  on the stock exchange within three
years after acquiring a majority stake in the lender, according
to  Ghana ’s central bank.  Fortiz will inject capital to address solvency and
liquidity challenges after agreeing to buy the holding from the
state pension fund and a unit of SIC Insurance Co., the  Bank of
Ghana  said in a statement on its website without providing
further details.  Fortiz, a private-equity firm based in Accra, acquired the
stake after talks between Merchant Bank and FirstRand Ltd. of
 South Africa  fell through. FirstRand offered to buy 75 percent
of Merchant Bank for about 750 million rand ($74 million).  Andrew Boye Doe, secretary of the Bank of Ghana, didn’t
answer two calls to his office today.  The Ghana Stock Exchange Financial Stocks Index, which
tracks the performance of banks and insurance companies,
advanced for a third day to a record high. The index added 0.2
percent by 2:48 p.m. in Accra, bringing this year’s gain to 69
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
