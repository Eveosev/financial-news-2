Carnival Corp. (CCL)  said Vice Chairman and
Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank will step down and take an
advisory role with the company.  The move comes four months after Arnold Donald assumed the
chief executive title at the world’s largest cruise operator
from Micky Arison, who held the position for 34 years. Arison
remains chairman of the Miami-based company.  Frank, 72, who had been vice chairman since 1993, will stay
on as special adviser to Arison and Donald, the company said in
a statement today. The change is effective Dec. 1.  Alan Buckelew, currently the president and chief executive
officer of the company’s  Princess Cruises  subsidiary, will
become Carnival’s chief operations officer. Stein Kruse, the
president and chief executive officer of Carnival’s Holland
America Line, will add Princess to his current responsibilities.  Carnival rose 1 percent to $35.20 at the close in New York.
The shares have dropped 4.3 percent this year through Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
