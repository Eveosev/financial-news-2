Canadian  consumer confidence  rose for
the first time in five weeks as opinions about job security and
house prices improved.  The Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index, a weekly
measure of the economic mood of Canadians, advanced to 58.5 in
the seven days through Nov. 1 from 57.7 the previous week. The
share of people in the survey giving positive responses on home
prices rose to 38.6 percent from 38.0 percent, the highest in
three months.  “More bullish views on real estate are the most likely to
be driving positive movement in Canadian consumer confidence at
this time,” said  Nik Nanos , chief executive officer at Nanos
Research Group in Ottawa.  The housing market remains one of the strongest parts of
the economy after years of support from low interest rates and a
solid labor market. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told
lawmakers on Oct. 29 that real estate remains firm even as
consumers take steps to curb record debt loads.  Reports this week may show further strength in domestic
spending. Statistics Canada will probably report Nov. 6 that
building permits rose 6 percent in September, and that
employment rose by 11,000 in October two days later, according
to surveys of economists by Bloomberg News.  The Nanos survey showed higher confidence in job security,
with 65.3 percent of respondents having a positive view, up from
64.4 percent in the last report.  Components Improve  Both components of the index rose last week. The Bloomberg
Nanos Canadian Pocketbook Index, based on personal finances and
job security, rose to 59.5 from 58.7. The Expectations Index,
measuring views on the economy and real-estate prices, increased
to 57.5 from 56.7, a five-week high.  “Canadian consumer sentiment stabilized likely due to
relief the U.S. fiscal standoff was resolved and rebounded in
confidence that Bank of Canada policy will prevent asset
deflation in the housing sector,” said  Joseph Brusuelas , senior
economist at Bloomberg LP in New York.  Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said Oct. 28 that Canada will
report a surplus in 2015 that won’t be “tiny,” following an
earlier report that the deficit for the year ended March 31 was
C$18.9 billion, or C$7 billion ($6.7 billion) less than
projected.  Statistics Canada reported Oct. 31 that the economy grew
0.3 percent in August on record oil and natural gas extraction,
faster than economist predictions for a 0.1 percent gain.  The Nanos survey showed more optimism about the economy’s
prospects, with the share of people saying it would improve
rising to 22.1 percent from 20.8 percent. The share of people
saying their personal finances had improved over the last year
was little changed, at 19.3 percent from 19.2 percent in the
last report.  The data in the indexes date to 2008 and are based on phone
interviews with 1,000 people, using a four-week rolling average
of 250 respondents. The results are accurate to within 3.1
percentage points, 19 times out of 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
