Red Electrica Corp. SA, operator of
 Spain ’s electricity-transmission network, had its  dividend
forecast  cut by Bloomberg analysts based on an earnings outlook
that’s little changed from last year.  The company probably will pay a semiannual dividend of 68.5
euro cents (92.5 U.S. cents) a share in early 2014, Bloomberg
said today in a note, trimming the forecast from 74.2 cents. Red
Electrica’s  adjusted earnings per share  will rise by 1.7 percent
to 3.70 euros in 2013, based on the mean of 20 estimates from
securities-house analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The grid operator, based in  Madrid ’s Alcobendas suburb, has
maintained or increased its dividend in recent years even as
consumer demand for power flagged during Spain’s recession.
 Demand  for the first 10 months of 2013 fell by an annual 2.5
percent, corrected for calendar and temperature effects.  The mean estimate for the company’s dividend yield this
year is about 5.3 percent, above the 4.4 percent average of a
group including the company and 14 peers tracked by Bloomberg.  Red Electrica wasn’t immediately able to comment, according
to a spokeswoman, who noted the dividend-payout ratio of 65
percent that the company targeted in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
