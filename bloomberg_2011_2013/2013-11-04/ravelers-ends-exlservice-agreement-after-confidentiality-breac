Travelers Cos. (TRV) , the property insurer
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ended a contract with
 ExlService Holdings Inc. (EXLS)  after the vendor’s employees violated
confidentiality policies.  The staff shared a “procedural document” externally,
according to a regulatory filing today from New York-based
ExlService, which provides offshore business-process services to
financial companies. The employees were fired, according to the
filing, which didn’t say how many people were involved.  Travelers represented 9.6 percent of the company’s  revenue 
for the three months ended Sept. 30. Termination of the contract
may lower ExlService’s revenue by $14 million to $28 million next
year, according to the filing. The vendor also said it’s required
to provide “disentanglement services” at its own expense for as
many as 18 months.  “While the company is disappointed in Travelers’ decision
to terminate, it is committed to work with Travelers to effect a
smooth transition while continuing to provide ongoing services in
accordance with the agreement,” ExlService said.  Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for New York-based Travelers,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
