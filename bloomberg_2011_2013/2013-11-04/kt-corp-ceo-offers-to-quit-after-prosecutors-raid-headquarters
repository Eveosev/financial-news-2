KT Corp. (030200) ,  South Korea ’s second-largest mobile operator, said Chief Executive Officer Lee Suk Chae offered to resign after prosecutors raided the company’s
headquarters and his home.  The board will soon decide the resignation date and discuss
a successor to Lee, who also held the role of chairman, the
Seongnam, South Korea-based carrier said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  Prosecutors raided KT’s headquarters and Lee’s home last
month as they investigate allegations the company incurred
losses on asset selloffs and bad investments.  People’s
Solidarity for Participatory Democracy , a South Korean civic
group, filed a lawsuit against the chairman in February,
alleging Lee caused about 80 billion won ($75 million) of losses
to the company by selling property too cheaply.  “Seeing executives and staff members suffering, I could no
longer delay the resignation,” Lee said in an e-mail to
 employees  yesterday. “I am also open to disclose all my salary
and  stock  bonuses, if the company can be freed from the recent
allegations and speculations.”  KT didn’t sell assets at low prices, Kim Dong Woo, a
spokesman for the company, said by phone today.  Shares of KT fell 1.6 percent to 34,650 won as of
11:52 a.m. in  Seoul . The stock has fallen 2.5 percent this year
 compared  with a 1.6 percent advance for the benchmark Kospi
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
