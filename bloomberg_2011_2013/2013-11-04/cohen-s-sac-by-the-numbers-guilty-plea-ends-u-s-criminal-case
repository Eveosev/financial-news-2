SAC Capital Advisors LP, the hedge-fund firm led by billionaire  Steven Cohen , has agreed to plead
guilty to a federal indictment and pay $1.8 billion as part of a
multiyear investigation into insider trading.  Cohen, who hasn’t been charged, faces an administrative
action filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for
his alleged failure to supervise the hedge fund’s activities.
Here are some facts about SAC Capital, which has been barred
from investing client money as part of today’s settlement.  *Rise and fall of assets:  1992: Cohen starts SAC Capital with $25 million  2007: Assets peak at $16.5 billion  Jan. 2013: Assets at $15 billion  Aug. 2013: SAC executives say they expect the firm to have
$9 billion at start of 2014  *SAC Employees:  SAC, which started with nine employees, employed 950 people
globally as of Sept. 20, according to a regulatory filing, about
50 fewer than it did in April. About 400 of those employees were
investment professionals.  SAC last month told employees that it’s closing its London
office, with more than 50 employees. The firm at that time said
it didn’t expect any further material changes in investment
headcount.  At least 11 former or current SAC employees have been
linked to  insider trading  while at the firm, most of them
working on technology and health-care stocks.  *Returns:  SAC’s average annual returns since inception: 25 percent.  SAC’s Highest Annual Return: 73 percent in 2000  SAC’s First Annual Loss: 19 percent in 2008  SAC’s Year-to-Date Returns through Oct. 31: 16 percent  *How Rivals Fared:  Millennium Management LLC, the $19 billion hedge fund firm
run by Israel Englander, posts an average annual return of 14
percent since its 1990 inception.  Brevan Howard Asset Management, the $40 billion hedge fund
co-founded at  Alan Howard , has produced an 11.7 percent return
since its 2003 inception  Tudor Investment Corp., the $13.2 billion firm run by  Paul
Tudor Jones , has returned an average annual of 19.4 percent
since 1986.  Industrywide Fines:  1987:  Ivan Boesky , who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1987
in an insider case, paid $100 million and was sentenced to three
years in prison.  1991:  Michael Milken , the former junk bond financier who
pleaded guilty to  securities fraud , paid more than $1.1 billion
in criminal and civil fines as part of his March 1991 settlement
with the Justice Department and SEC.  2011: Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group LLC co-founder
whose 11-year prison sentence is one of the longest in U.S.
history for insider trading, was ordered to pay $156 million in
civil and criminal fines and penalties stemming from his
conviction in 2011.  2013:  Rajat Gupta , the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
director found guilty of passing confidential tips to
Rajaratnam, was ordered to pay $13.9 million in a related U.S.
regulatory case.  Nov. 2013: SAC to pay $1.8 billion, a record for insider
trading. To date, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office has filed
insider trading charges against at least 87 people, and won
convictions against 75 since August 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
