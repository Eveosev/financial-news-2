Corn futures in  South Africa  rose to
the highest levels in more than four months by the midday close
in Johannesburg.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 2.2 percent to 2,460 rand ($241) a metric ton,
the highest closing price for the contract on the South African
Futures Exchange since June 20. The yellow variety for delivery
in the same month gained 1.9 percent to 2,355 rand a ton, the
highest since June 25.  The country is the continentâ€™s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for delivery in December gained for a fourth day to
to 3,580 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
