Damac Real Estate Development Ltd. is
valued by analysts at $3.9 billion to $5.4 billion in its London
initial public offering, according to three people briefed on
the process.  Analysts at banks managing the IPO published research today
with their estimated equity-valuation range for Damac, said the
people, who declined to be named as the information is private.
The range is an average of the published research.  Damac Properties Development Co., a Dubai-based housing
developer, plans to raise as much as $500 million in the IPO. Al
Firdous Holding and Sahira Co., controlled by Damac founder and
chairman Hussain Sajwani, will offer global depositary receipts
in a new company called Damac Real Estate Development. Each GDR
will be worth three ordinary shares of the company, according to
a statement today.  A spokesman for Damac in Dubai declined to comment on the
sale valuations.  Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and VTB Capital Plc are
among banks managing the companyâ€™s listing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
