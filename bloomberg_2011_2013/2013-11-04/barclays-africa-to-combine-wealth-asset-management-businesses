Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s South African unit
plans to combine its wealth, asset management, stock broking and
investment administration businesses.  That will align the structures of  Barclays Africa Group
Ltd. (BGA)  with those of its parent and make it easier for customers
to interact with the bank, Nomkhita Nqweni, head of the new
unit, said at a presentation in Johannesburg today. The unit
will have 225 billion rand ($22.1 billion) of assets under
management, she said.  Barclays increased its holding to 62.3 percent after the
South African bank acquired the bulk of the London-based
lender’s African assets this year in an all-share deal worth
18.3 billion rand. The new unit will have about 600 staff, said
Lee Francis, chief operating officer of the wealth division.  Barclays Africa rose 0.3 percent to 152.36 rand as of 12:46
a.m. in Johannesburg today, paring this year’s decline to 7.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
