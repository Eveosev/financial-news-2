Dana Gas PJSC (DANA) , an oil and natural gas
producer forced to restructure debt last year, said third-quarter profit fell 2 percent as higher royalties and faster
depreciation at assets in Egypt slowed growth.  Third-quarter net income slipped to 102 million dirhams
($28 million), from 104 million dirhams a year earlier, Dana Gas
said in a statement today to the Abu Dhabi stock market. Gross
revenue gained 21 percent to 623 million dirhams. The amount of
cash the company is owed for past sales in Egypt and  Iraq  rose.  Dana Gas, based in the United Arab Emirates sheikhdom of
Sharjah, changed terms on about $1 billion in Islamic bonds, or
sukuk, last year after the Egyptian and Iraqi governments
delayed payments for fuel. These receivables and the global
financial crisis hampered its efforts to refinance.  The company said it was owed 2.78 billion dirhams in total
trade receivables. In  Egypt , it was owed 1.09 billion dirhams at
the end of September, up from 960 million dirhams at the end of
June. In Iraq, where Dana Gas operates in the semi-autonomous
Kurdish region of the countryâ€™s north, trade receivables grew to
1.65 billion dirhams at the end of September from 1.47 billion
dirhams at the end of June.  Production of oil, gas and other fuels increased 17 percent
in the third quarter to an average of 66,850 barrels of oil
equivalent per day compared with the same three months of 2012,
Dana Gas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
