Bank of Nova Scotia  moved Barbara Mason, executive vice president of global  wealth management , to
the new role of chief human resources officer amid a shuffle of
senior executives at Canada’s third-biggest bank.  Mason, who has been at Scotiabank for 31 years, assumes the
job immediately and reports to Chief Executive Officer  Brian Porter , Toronto-based Scotiabank said today in a statement.
Mason will be responsible for all global human resources,
communications and marketing functions.  James O’Sullivan  was appointed to the new role of executive
vice president of global asset management, reporting to Chris Hodgson, who is group head for global wealth and insurance,
Scotiabank said. O’Sullivan has been with the bank since 1990,
with senior leadership roles in investment banking, mergers and
acquisitions and, most recently, as chief financial officer for
the global wealth and insurance unit.  Porter, 55, took over as CEO on Nov. 1, succeeding  Richard Waugh , who retired after a decade as head of the bank. Waugh,
65, is the firm’s deputy chairman and remains on the board until
the end of January.  Stephen Hart became chief risk officer on Sept. 1, taking
over from Robert Pitfield, who is retiring after 30 years.
Pitfield continues until January to help with the transition,
Scotiabank said in an Aug. 29 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
