Annual wind-farm installations in
Latin America will almost double by 2022 driven by faster
economic growth, according to  Navigant Consulting Inc. (NCI)   The region will install about 4,300 megawatts by that date
compared with an estimated 2,200 megawatts this year, the
Chicago-based consulting firm said today in a report.  “Latin America is expected to account for at least 5.5
percent of the world’s new wind-power installations in 2013,”
Feng Zhao, research director for Navigant Research, a unit of
Navigant Consulting, said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
