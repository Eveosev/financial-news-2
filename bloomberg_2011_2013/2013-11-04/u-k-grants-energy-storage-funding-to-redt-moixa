Redt U.K. Ltd. and Moixa Technology
Ltd. won government funds to develop ways to store energy as
Britain seeks to accommodate its growing renewable-power output.  Redt, based in Wokingham,  England , won a 3.6 million-pound
($5.7 million) contract to develop storage for  wind energy , the
government said today in a statement. London-based Moixa
received a 1.7 million-pound deal to install battery-based
storage units that hold power for use during peak demand.  The development of energy-storage technologies is crucial
for balancing supply and demand as Britain adds wind and solar
plants, whose output is intermittent. The U.K. needs at least
2,000 megawatts of new storage by 2020 to accommodate
renewables, according to the  Electricity Storage Network .  Delays in meeting that goal would result in 100 million
pounds a year of extra costs for taxpayers and investors and a
“loss of value” rising to 10 billion pounds a year by 2050,
the industry group said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
