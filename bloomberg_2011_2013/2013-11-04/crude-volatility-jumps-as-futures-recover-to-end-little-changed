Crude options volatility jumped as
the underlying futures slipped to almost $94 a barrel before
recovering to settle little changed.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
20.99 percent at 4:05 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
up from 20.04 on Nov. 1. Puts protecting against a 10 percent
drop in prices increased to 30.28 percent compared with 28.41 in
the prior session.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 1
cent to settle at $94.62 a barrel the Nymex, after settling at
the lowest level since June 21 in the prior session. Futures
touched $94.06 after the dollar weakened against the euro. A
weaker dollar raises the investment of appeal of dollar-denominated commodities.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 52
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most-active
options were December $90 puts, which fell 6 cents to 25 cents a
barrel with 2,803 lots trading as of 4:10 p.m. December $95
calls declined 18 cents to $1.10 on volume of 2,134 lots.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 57 percent of
the 183,203 lots traded. December $95 puts rose 72 cents to
$1.67 a barrel with 13,774 contracts trading. December $90 puts
