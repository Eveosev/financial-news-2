A case of 2006 Chateau Leoville
Barton, a Bordeaux second-growth wine estate, fetched 408 pounds
($650) on Liv-ex, taking the vintage to its highest level for
eight months amid some signs of increased trading activity.  The sale on Nov. 1 was up from the level of 395 pounds to
400 pounds a case at which it traded in September and 11 percent
above the five-year low of 366 pounds in October 2012, according
to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, fell 1.5 percent in October, its sixth month of declines
in the past seven, extending a slide which has taken it down
more than 5 percent since the end of March. While the index
tracks first growths, other wines including some second growths
have outperformed it, and an increase in wines with active bids
or offers to a record level may signal reviving market interest.  “The market may be tough,” Liv-ex said in its market
blog, but “with both active markets and total exposure at
record highs, opportunities abound.” Total exposure, measuring
the value of bids and offers on Liv-ex, has reached a record 23
million pounds, it said.  This month’s trade in Leoville Barton ’06 compares with the
high of 455 pounds a case it reached in September 2011 during a
 bull market  in Bordeaux wine powered by Chinese demand, which
has since abated. It is within the range of 345 pounds to 425
pounds at which the wine traded on Liv-ex in May 2007 soon after
its release to the market.  Eighteenth-Century Roots  The 2006 Leoville Barton ranks among the estate’s three
cheapest wines of the past decade, ahead only of the 2007 and
similarly-priced to the 2008, according to merchant prices
collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  It was rated 91+ on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic  Robert Parker  in a February 2009 online tasting note, putting it below
at least six other vintages in the past 10 years, according to
data on the eRobertParker website.  The Barton family, owner of the estate, traces its history
in Bordeaux back to 1725, when Thomas Barton arrived in the city
from Ireland and went on to found a wine merchant which became
Barton & Guestier. For the past three decades the estate has
been run by Anthony Barton, who took it over from his uncle
Ronald.  Leoville-Barton is in the Saint-Julien district north of
Bordeaux and is a neighbor of Chateau Langoa Barton, owned by
the same family. Leoville-Barton was designated a second-growth
vineyard in the classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s 1855
Paris Exhibition, which remains in force.  Leoville-Barton, covering 45 hectares (111 acres), is
planted to 72 percent Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, 20 percent
Merlot and 8 percent Cabernet Franc, according to Leoville-Barton’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
