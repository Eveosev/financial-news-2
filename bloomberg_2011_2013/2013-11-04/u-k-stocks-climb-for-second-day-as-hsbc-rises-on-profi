U.K. stocks  rose, after four weeks of
gains for the benchmark  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index, as  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
rallied after reporting results and investors awaited a European
Central Bank policy meeting this week.  HSBC Holdings Plc added 2.1 percent as third-quarter pretax
profit rose 30 percent. Rio Tinto Group and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  each
advanced more than 1 percent.  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  tumbled 11
percent in Dublin, leading airline shares lower, after
forecasting a drop in full-year profit. Weir Group Plc slid 7.8
percent after saying currency swings will reduce profit.  The FTSE 100 rose 33.51 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,768.25
at 9:01 a.m. in London. The equity benchmark climbed 0.2 percent
last week. It has gained 15 percent this year, heading for the
best annual performance since 2009. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index also increased 0.5 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index slipped 1 percent.  HSBC gained 2 percent to 701.1 pence. Pretax profit rose to
$4.53 billion in the third quarter from $3.48 billion in the
year-earlier period, the lender said.  Investors awaited the ECB’s interest-rate decision at a
monthly policy meeting on Nov. 7, as the euro fell to a six-week
low in intra-day trading. Bank of America Corp., UBS AG and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  predict  the central bank will
cut its benchmark rate from a record low of 0.5 percent at the
meeting, according to a Bloomberg survey of 68 economists. The
rest forecast no change.  The CBI, a U.K. business lobby, said in a quarterly report
it expects the British economy to expand 1.4 percent this year
and 2.4 percent in 2014. That compares with its August forecast
of 1.2 percent in 2013 and 2.3 percent next year. It also
estimated unemployment will fall to 7.2 percent at the end of
2015 from its current 7.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
