SMA Solar Technology (S92) , the biggest
producer of inverters used in power distribution, cut its sales
target and forecast a loss for the year on weak European demand.  SMA estimates sales of 900 million euros ($1.2 billion) to
1 billion euros, down from as much as 1.3 billion euros, it said
today in a statement. The company expects to report a loss of 80
million to 90 million euros, compared with the prior best case
of breaking even before one-time items.  The board expects sales to recover to 1 billion euros to
1.3 billion euros and regain its profitability in 2014, it said.  “We have a strongly declining demand in our core markets
in  Europe  that cannot be compensated by the new Asian and
American markets,” Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Pascal Urbon
said in the statement. The company, based in Niestetal,  Germany ,
said the cost of restructuring Zeversolar, a Chinese inverter
maker it agreed to buy in 2012, is also weighing on earnings.  SMA has seen  sales drop  since 2010 on concerns that Europe
would impose anti-dumping fees on Chinese solar products.  The solar company said in July that it would eliminate 700
full-time jobs in Germany by the end of next year to cut costs.  Inverters are used to convert energy from solar panels into
power that can be transmitted on an electricity grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
