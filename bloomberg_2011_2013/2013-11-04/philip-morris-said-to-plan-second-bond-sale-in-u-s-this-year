Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) , the
world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, sold $2 billion
of bonds in three parts in its second U.S. offering this year.  The company issued $750 million each of 1.875 percent bonds
due January 2019 to yield 68 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and 4.875 percent, 30-year securities at a
118 basis-point spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It also sold $500 million of 3.6 percent, 10-year debt at a
relative yield of 108 basis points. The offering, its first in
dollars since February, is expected to be rated A2 by Moody’s
Investors Service.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings
Plc managed the offering for the New York-based company, which
split from  Altria Group Inc. (MO)  in 2008, Bloomberg data show.
Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including
working capital, share repurchases and debt refinancing,
according to a regulatory  filing .  Altria, which still owns cigarette manufacturer Philip
Morris USA Inc., issued $3.2 billion last week to help fund a
tender offer, Bloomberg data show. The company sold $1.4 billion
of 4 percent, 10-year notes and $1.8 billion of 5.375 percent,
30-year securities that are expected to be rated Baa1 by
Moody’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
