New York spot gasoline strengthened
to a  seven-week high  on speculation European refinery
maintenance is limiting shipments to the U.S. Northeast.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in the New York
Harbor climbed 2.75 cents to 5.75 cents a gallon above futures
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:54 p.m., the strongest
level since Sept. 13. Conventional,  83.5-octane gasoline , or
CBOB, gained 0.37 cent to a premium of 4.5 cents.  Gasoline cargoes to the U.S. from Europe may be limited due
to seasonal maintenance, according to a weekly note from Energy
Analytics Group Ltd. Outages at  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Bayway, New
Jersey, refinery and Irving Oil Corp.’s Saint John plant in New
Brunswick may also be supporting prices.  With the capacity to process about 238,000 barrels a day,
Bayway is the closest  plant  to New York Harbor. The 298,800-barrel-a-day Saint John refinery exports over half of its
finished products, including gasoline and diesel, to the U.S.
northeast, according to Irving’s website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in New York was unchanged at 0.25
cent a gallon above Nymex futures, while No. 54 jet fuel climbed
0.63 cent to a discount of 0.5 cent a gallon.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a measure of refining
margins for gasoline and diesel based on Brent oil in Europe,
gained 59 cents to $7.38 a barrel, a two-week high, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline advanced on the Gulf Coast. CBOB added 0.75 cent
to 22.25 cents a gallon below futures, while conventional, 87-octane gasoline climbed 1 cent to a discount of 21.25 cents.  The  3-2-1 crack  on the Gulf, based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped 26 cents to $9.49 a
barrel. The same spread based on  Light Louisiana Sweet oil , the
U.S. Gulf Coast benchmark, slipped 11 cents to $6.49 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
