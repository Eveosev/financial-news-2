Spain ’s government bonds fell, with
10-year yields climbing from the lowest level in six months,
before the nation sells as much as 4 billion euros ($5.4
billion) of debt this week.  Italian securities dropped for the first time in three days
after an industry report showed an index of manufacturing in the
nation unexpectedly declined. German bunds advanced, with 10-year yields falling toward the lowest level in 12 weeks, before
the  European Central Bank  meets to review monetary policy on
Thursday. Euro-area bonds rallied last week as slowing inflation
spurred some economists to predict the central bank will reduce
 interest rates  this week.  “Ten-year yields may rise as the market cheapens into the
auction,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist
at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “There is less support from
domestic investors in that area than at the short end. But
overall, I expect the spread tightening trend to continue. The
Spanish sale will be fine as the country has come successfully
to the market and has already front-loaded its supply.”  Spain’s  10-year yield  climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.01 percent at 4:46 p.m.  London  time after
dropping to 3.95 percent, the lowest level since May 3. The 4.4
percent bond due in October 2023 fell 0.34, or 3.40 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 103.135.  Spain will sell debt due in October 2018, October 2023 and
July 2026 on Nov. 7. The country has met 92.6 percent of its
planned medium- to long-term financing needs this year, the
 Economy Ministry  said on Oct. 22. The average borrowing cost for
debt issued this year was 2.58 percent as of Sept. 31, down from
3.01 percent at the end of 2012, it said.  Spread Widens  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
securities instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened six
basis points to 234 basis points after contracting to 226 basis
points, the narrowest since June 2011.  Italy’s bonds fell after Markit Economics said an index of
manufacturing in the country based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  dropped to 50.7 last month from 50.8 in September.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an increase to 51.  The economy will start recovering in the fourth quarter,
Finance Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni was reported by newswire
Ansa as saying.  Italy’s  10-year yield  climbed four basis points to 4.12
percent. It earlier declined to 4.07 percent, the lowest level
since May 29.  ECB Forecasts  Bank of America Corp., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
UBS AG all predict the ECB will cut borrowing costs at its
meeting this week. The rest of the 68 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predict no change. The ECB last lowered its benchmark
in May to a record 0.5 percent.  “While there are signs of improvement in the euro region,
recent data suggested the recovery is still weak,” said  Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-rate strategy at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “That and the
decline in consumer prices make it likely the ECB will prepare
ground for a rate cut at the meeting this week.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield dropped one basis point to 1.68
percent after declining to 1.65 percent on Oct. 31, the lowest
level since Aug. 8.  Austria, Germany and  France  will also sell bonds this week.
Austria will auction securities due in 2018 and 2022 tomorrow,
Germany will sell 4 billion euros of five-year notes the
following day and France will offer securities due in 2024 and
2045 on Thursday.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Ireland and  Belgium ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds returned 11 percent this year through Nov. 1,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy’s gained 6.9
percent, while Germany’s declined 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
