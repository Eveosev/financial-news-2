XL Group Plc (XL) , the insurer led by Chief
Executive Officer Mike McGavick, hired David Miller as senior
vice president and head of claims for international property and
casualty coverage.  Miller joins from  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  and will
work in  London , reporting to Andrew Pinkes, the global head of
claims for insurance operations, the company said today in a
statement. He replaces Graham Lambourne, who left the company,
said Sinead Finlay, a spokeswoman for the Dublin-based insurer.  XL and AIG have been competing for talent as they seek to
win business among multinational commercial clients. The New
York-based insurer last month announced it hired Seraina Maag
from McGavick’s company to run Europe, Middle East and Africa
operations as chief executive officer for the region. XL said in
September that Denise Balan, formerly of AIG, would lead a new
team providing coverage against war, terrorism and kidnapping.  Miller’s background “driving high quality claims service
across Europe equips him for his new role, which will see him
leading teams in 14 countries,” Pinkes said in the statement.  Steven Eckhardt has been named to replace Miller at AIG,
said Matt Gallagher, a spokesman for the insurer. Eckhardt, who
was previously chief operating officer for commercial claims,
will move to London for the new post, according to a company
memo. He joined AIG in 1982.  To contact the reporter on this story:
