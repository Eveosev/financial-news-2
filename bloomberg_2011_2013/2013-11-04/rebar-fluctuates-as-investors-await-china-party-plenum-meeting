Steel reinforcement-bar futures swung
between gains and losses before a meeting of  China ’s top
Communist Party officials in Beijing which will map out a
blueprint for economic reform.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract by volume
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, rose as much as 0.4 percent to
3,685  yuan  ($603) a ton and fell as low as 3,666 yuan before
trading at 3,670 yuan by 10:41 a.m. local time. The contract
lost 1.5 percent last month.  The Third Plenum meeting on Nov. 9-12 comes as
manufacturing shows signs of expansion amid excessive credit
growth, rising local-government debt and weaker export momentum.
The agenda may include land and tax policies, according to a
front-page editorial published by China Securities Journal.  “Everyone is a bit anxious before the meeting and wants to
know what it means for the market,” said Zheng Ge, an analyst
at Wanda Futures Co. in Beijing. “Firmness in spot  iron ore  and
a decline in rebar inventory provided support.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port, tracked by
the Steel Index, jumped 2.6 percent on Nov. 1 to $135.30 a dry
ton, the highest level since Sept. 5.  Rebar inventory  in China
slumped 5.2 percent to 5.66 million tons as of Nov. 1, the
lowest since January, according to Shanghai Steelhome
Information Technology Co.  Iron ore for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
rose 0.7 percent to 949 yuan a ton today.  The spot price of rebar was little changed on Nov. 1 at
3,510 yuan a ton, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
