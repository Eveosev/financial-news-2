Palm oil  declined the most in seven
weeks as some investors sold on concern that a rally to a one-year high and into a  bull market  may be overdone.  The contract for January delivery lost as much as 1.7
percent to 2,583 ringgit ($815) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the steepest drop for futures since Sept.
17. Palm was at 2,584 ringgit at 4:10 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur.
Prices rose to 2,628 ringgit on Nov. 1, the highest close since
September 2012 and 21 percent more than the 2,167 settlement on
July 29, meeting the common definition of a bull market.  Prices rallied 7.5 percent last week for a fourth weekly
gain on speculation that output in top producers  Indonesia  and
Malaysia is less than analysts expected and that the start of
the monsoon season this month would further curb supply. The 14-day relative strength index for palm was 70.5. Some traders see
readings above 70 as a sign a drop in prices is imminent.  “Today’s decline is just a pullback of an uptrend,” said
Benny Lee, a market strategist at Jupiter Securities Sdn. in
 Kuala Lumpur . “This pullback should be temporary as the uptrend
is still intact.”  Several major plantation companies in Indonesia reported
that output unexpectedly declined 7 percent to 10 percent in the
first 10 months, Derom Bangun, chairman of the country’s palm
oil board, said last week. Some regions had too much rain during
the dry season disrupting pollination and some trees suffered
from a five-year low in their production cycle, he said.  Soybean oil  for December delivery advanced 0.7 percent to
41.86 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while
soybeans for January climbed 0.4 percent to $12.57 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for May delivery lost 0.9 percent to close
at 6,318  yuan  ($1,036) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
and soybean oil gained 0.3 percent to end at 7,326 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
