Regal Entertainment Group (RGC)  plans to
use free cash flow that may reach the most since 2009 on
acquisitions and dividends as it seeks to maintain its level of
 indebtedness .  The biggest U.S. cinema operator by revenue may use  free
cash flow , or cash from operations after deducting capital
expenses, to acquire an estimated 150 to 400 movie theater
screens, after adding 813 during the last two years, said Chief
Financial Officer David Ownby. The company’s free cash flow may
be $279.4 million for fiscal 2014, according to analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The theater chain operator with  $2.2 billion  in  debt  has
had a recurring  dividend  since 2002 and has paid five special
dividends, Ownby said. The Knoxville, Tennessee-based company’s
ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization was 3.2 times as of Sept. 30,
Ownby said in a third-quarter 2013 earnings call.  “The future, in terms of capital allocation, looks a lot
like the past for us,” he said in an Oct. 29 telephone
interview. “We’re pretty comfortable where our leverage is
today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
