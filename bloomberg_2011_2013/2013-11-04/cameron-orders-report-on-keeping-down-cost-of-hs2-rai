Prime Minister  David Cameron  ordered
the new head of the planned high-speed rail line from London to
northern  England  to study how costs can be kept down, amid
continued political uncertainty over the project.  The opposition  Labour Party  has suggested it may scrap the
50 billion-pound ($80 billion) line, known as HS2, if it wins
the 2015 election and costs continue to rise. The premier said
last month the plan needs all-party support and he’ll call today
on “everyone across politics to put their own interests aside
and put the national interest first,” according to extracts
from a speech released by his office  The new chairman of HS2 Ltd., David Higgins, “has agreed
that the first vital step will be to bring his penetrating eye
and expertise to a specific task,” Cameron will tell the
Confederation of British Industry’s annual conference in  London 
today. That will be to “report on the costs and to maximize the
benefits for all parts of the country as quickly as possible.”  Higgins said after his appointment in September that the
line, which will run from London to Birmingham and then on to
Manchester and Leeds, can’t be a “political football.” The
route is designed to cut journey times and increase capacity on
existing lines for freight.  “Those who want to delay or obstruct HS2 show a lack of
vision,” Cameron will say in his speech today. “They are
playing politics with Britain’s prosperity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
