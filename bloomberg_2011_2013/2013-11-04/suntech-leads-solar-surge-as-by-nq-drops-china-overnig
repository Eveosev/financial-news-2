Chinese stocks advanced in New York,
led by Suntech Power Holdings Ltd. and  Yingli Green Energy
Holdings Ltd. (YGE) , on prospects a global oversupply of solar panels
is easing.  The Bloomberg China-US Index of the most traded Chinese

since Oct. 22. Suntech, whose main unit was put in bankruptcy in
March, rallied 17 percent. Online retailer  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) 
jumped to a record as Citigroup Inc. raised its price estimate
on the shares.  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ) , the mobile-services provider that
was accused by short-seller Muddy Waters LLC last month of
engaging in a “massive fraud,” sank for a second day.  Prices on silicon solar modules, used to make solar panels,
rose 1.4 percent in October as demand from China,  Japan  and the
U.S. increased, according to Bloomberg Industries, after a

last year.  Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , a Guelph, Ontario-based producer
of photovoltaic panels, said yesterday that it expects to report
its first quarterly profit in more than two years.  “Pricing has stabilized across the industry,” James Evans, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Industries, said in a
telephone interview from  London . “We are seeing some operation
improvements. There’s some potential for that to continue.”  The  iShares China Large-Cap ETF , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., rose 0.1 percent to $37.86 in
New York. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4 percent to
1,767.93 as Exxon Mobil Corp. and U.S. Steel Corp. led a
commodity rally.  Shunfeng Purchase  Suntech, the world’s largest photovoltaic maker by
shipments in 2011, jumped to $1.54. The company said on Nov. 1
that Shunfeng Photovoltaic International Ltd., a Chinese solar
company, agreed to buy its unit Wuxi Suntech Power Co. for 3
billion  yuan  ($492 million).  The Suntech unit was pulled into bankruptcy in March and
will use the proceeds to pay expenses and debts it owes.  Yingli, the largest solar-panel maker, rose 7.1 percent,
the biggest increase since September, to $6.77.  Trina Solar

to $16.77.  American depositary receipts of  China Telecom Ltd. (CHA) , the

will rise to $85, citing progress on “operational efficiency.”  Qunar, 58.Com  NQ Mobile, based in Beijing, fell 6.6 percent to $11.94.

allegations. More than $560 million in market value has
evaporated since Muddy Waters made a “strong sell”
recommendation.  LightInTheBox Holding Co., (LITB)  a Beijing-based online retailer,

public offering in June. Its decline was the biggest  among
U.S.-listed Chinese firms.  Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd. (QUNR) , a travel-booking service
