A group led by  Aluminum Corp. of
China  was shortlisted to bid for  Glencore (GLEN)  Xstrata Plc’s Las
Bambas copper project in  Peru , said an executive at the Chinese
company.  “It’s a competitive process,” said Liu Xiangmin, senior
vice president of the Beijing-based company known as Chinalco,
in an interview at the  China  Mining conference in Tianjin. “We
are confident about our bid.”  Chinalco is leading a bidding consortium that’s offered
about $5 billion for the mine, which Glencore agreed to sell to
obtain Chinese regulatory approval for its $29 billion takeover
of Xstrata Plc this year, said two people with knowledge of the
matter. The group also includes Jinchuan Group Ltd., China’s
third-largest copper producer, said the people, asking not to be
named because the details are confidential.  Glencore Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg said in
September that as many as four Chinese suitors were expected to
make offers for the Las Bambas project. China Minmetals Corp. is
leading another group of bidders, people familiar with the
matter said last month.  Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Glencore, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
