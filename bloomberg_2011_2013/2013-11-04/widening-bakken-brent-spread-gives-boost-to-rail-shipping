Bakken crude in  North Dakota  slipped
to an eight-month low against European imports, prompting a U.S.
East Coast refiner to increase crude-by-rail shipments.  Plains Marketing LP’s Williston Basin sweet oil posted
price weakened to $29.51 a barrel less than Dated Brent on Nov.
1, the widest discount since March 6. It narrowed by 26 cents to
$29.25 a barrel at 4:06 p.m. in New York.  The discount, which compares field prices in North Dakota
to the European benchmark that many waterborne crudes are priced
against, narrowed to $10.52 a barrel on July 19 as the Syncrude
upgrader in Alberta reduced production during maintenance after
a fire.  The discount widened as the Syncrude upgrader returned from
maintenance last month. It produced 308,300 barrels of synthetic
light, sweet crude a day in October, the most since April,
according to the website of  Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the plant’s
operating partner.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  is moving more crude by rail, company
executives said on an Oct. 30 conference call.  “Today, rail movements for us showed, in total, are
probably a little less and 100,000 barrels a day or so, but
clearly we’re ramping up our capacity,” Chief Executive Officer
Greg Garland said.  The company cut crude-by-rail shipments to its Bayway
refinery in  New Jersey  to 30,000 barrels a day in August or
September from 100,000 in the second quarter as the spread
narrowed, Tim Taylor, the company’s executive vice president of
commercial, transportation, business development and marketing,
said on the same call.  To contact the reporters on this story:
