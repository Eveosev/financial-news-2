South Africa ’s rand gained for the
first time in seven days against the dollar, snapping its
longest losing streak in five months, on speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve will maintain monetary stimulus that drove
demand for riskier assets.  The  U.S. economy  probably slowed in the third quarter and
employers hired fewer workers in October, indicating the
expansion was losing momentum even before the partial government
shutdown, economists project reports to show this week.
Manufacturing in South Africa slowed in September, a report may
show on Nov. 7.  “If consensus expectations for this week’s data releases
are anything to go by, the dollar’s strength should face some
headwinds,” Theuns de Wet, the head of global markets research
at Rand Merchant Bank, said in an e-mailed note. “A softening
growth and employment picture should push back expectations that
the Fed is about to kick off its tapering process.”  The rand appreciated 0.2 percent to 10.1660 per dollar as
of 9:44 a.m. in Johannesburg, rebounding from a 3.7 percent
slump last week. Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due Dec.
2026 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.19
percent.  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 2 percent annualized
rate after a 2.5 percent pace from April through June, according
to the median forecast of 69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
before Commerce Department figures due Nov. 7.  Payrolls rose by
125,000 workers after a 148,000 gain in September, Labor
Department figures may show.  In South Africa, manufacturing was unchanged in September
from a year earlier and down from a 0.2 percent advance in the
previous month, according to the median estimate of 13
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Mining production probably
rose 6.8 percent, from 2.1 percent, a separate report may show
on Nov. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
