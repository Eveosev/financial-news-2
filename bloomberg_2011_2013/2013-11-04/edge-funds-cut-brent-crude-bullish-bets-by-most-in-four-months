Hedge funds  and other money managers
cut bullish bets on  Brent crude  by the most in four months,
according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 119,451 lots in
the week ended Oct. 29, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. That’s a reduction of
30,710 contracts, or 21 percent, from the previous week, and the
biggest drop since the week ended June 25.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish wagers by 321,470, a 3.2
percent decrease in their net-short position from Oct. 22.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators and institutional
investors, as well as commercial companies that buy or sell
futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and investors
follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Brent futures declined by 0.9 percent to $109.01 a barrel
in the week to Oct. 29 and traded at $105.63 as of 12:36 p.m.
London time today on the ICE exchange.  Swaps dealers increased net-long positions in Brent by 12
percent to 229,043.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European gasoil fell by 14
percent to 66,204 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
