South Africa  approved 33.8 billion
rand ($3.3 billion) for 17 clean-energy projects in the third of
five bidding rounds of a program to cut its reliance on coal.  The  Department of Energy  received bids for 6,023 megawatts
of capacity and allocated 1,456 megawatts, Director General
Nelisiwe Magubane told reporters today in  Pretoria , the capital.  South  Africa  plans to add 3,725 megawatts of renewable-energy capacity by the end of 2016 with five tenders. That may
help state utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which supplies more
than 95 percent of the nation’s power and uses coal for 85
percent of its generation, to meet demand as it struggles to pay
for expansion in the continent’s biggest economy.  “Window 3 will contribute approximately 4.4 billion rand
to socio-economic development, aggregating to a cumulative
investment of 9 billion rand,” Energy Minister Ben Martins said
in Pretoria.  Twenty-year power-purchase agreements with Eskom helped
drive $5.7 billion of clean-energy investments to the country
last year, or about a quarter of the total invested in sub-Saharan Africa, Bloomberg New Energy Finance data show.  Of the 17 preferred bidders named in the third round, seven
will provide power derived from wind, six from solar
photovoltaic facilities, two from concentrated solar and one
each from landfill gas and biomass, the department said in a
statement handed to reporters.  China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) , that country’s biggest
wind-farm operator, will jointly develop the biggest project
awarded in this round, the Longyuan Mulilo De Aar 2 North Wind
Energy Facility, which will have contracted capacity to supply
139 megawatts at 740 rand per megawatt hour.  One megawatt of capacity is enough to supply 2,000 average
European homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
