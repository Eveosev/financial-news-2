Gasoline slid to the lowest level in
almost two years on speculation supply will rise as U.S.
refiners return units to production after repairs.  Futures sank as much as 1.2 percent and crack spreads
narrowed. Over the past five years, U.S. refinery  rates 
increased an average of 1.1 percentage points in November and
December over the past five years, Energy Information
Administration data show.  “The market is being weighed on by the return of refiners
from maintenance and the expected increase in supply,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.  Gasoline for December delivery sank 2.01 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.5253 a gallon at 9:27 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and touched $2.5153, the lowest intraday
level since Dec. 20, 2011. Trading volume on all contracts was
17 percent above the 100-day average.  Refineries are restarting units after planned seasonal work
and unscheduled repairs. Phillips 66 said on Nov. 1 that it
completed maintenance at its 146,000-barrel-a-day Borger, Texas,
 refinery . Delta Air Lines Inc.’s Monroe Energy LLC subsidiary
said that same day that it was operating the fluid catalytic
cracker at its 185,000-barrel-a-day Trainer,  Pennsylvania ,  plant 
after unplanned work.  Gasoline production  in the week ended Oct. 25 was the
highest since Aug. 16, when refiners were trying to meet higher
summer demand.  Crack Spreads  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 86 cents to $11.44 a barrel. The
fuel’s  spread  versus Brent fell 53 cents to a 47-cent premium.  U.S. retail  pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent
to $3.252 a gallon, the lowest level since Dec. 25, Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA said today on its website. Prices are 22.3
cents below a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for December delivery slid 1.27
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $2.8695 a gallon, the lowest intraday
price since July 1. Trading volume was 39 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  over WTI declined 51 cents to $25.93 a
barrel. The  spread  versus Brent narrowed 22 cents to $14.92.  To contact the reporter on this story:
