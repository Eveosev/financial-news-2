The U.S. unit of French utility
 Electricite de France SA  agreed to buy a 200-megawatt wind
project in the Texas Panhandle, its third such deal this year.  Construction on the Longhorn Wind Project is expected to
begin this year about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northeast of
Lubbock, according to a statement today from San Diego-based EDF
Renewable Energy. Terms of the deal with closely held Renewable
Energy Systems Americas Inc. weren’t disclosed.  The Longhorn acquisition brings the company’s “near-term
capacity” in the Panhandle to 561 megawatts, Ryan Pfaff, EDF’s
executive vice president, said in the statement.  Beginning construction in 2013 will qualify the project for
the production tax credit for power produced from clean sources,
which was renewed for one year on Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
