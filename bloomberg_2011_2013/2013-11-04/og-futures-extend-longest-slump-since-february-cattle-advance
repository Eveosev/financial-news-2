Hog futures fell for the fifth
straight session, the longest slump since February, on signs of
increased U.S. pork output. Cattle prices rose.  Meatpackers processed 434,000 hogs today, a 1.9 percent
increase from a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. The average carcass on Nov. 1 weighed 211.92 pounds
(96.1 kilograms), or 2.7 percent heavier than a year earlier,
according to the USDA. Cash prices are down 17 percent from this
year’s high on June 13,  government  data show.  “Weights are way up,”  Ryan Turner , a risk-management
consultant with FCStone Group Inc., said in a telephone
interview from  Kansas City ,  Missouri . “The new-crop corn is
going into these hogs, which is having weights bloom.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell less than 0.1
percent to close at 88.325 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prices are down 3.9 percent since
Oct. 28, the longest slump for a most-active contract since Feb.
22.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $1.321 a pound on CME, halting a three-session slide.
Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement increased 0.2
percent to $1.6385 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
