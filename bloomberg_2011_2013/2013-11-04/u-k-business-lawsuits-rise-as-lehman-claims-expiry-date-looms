U.K. business lawsuits increased 23
percent in the last year as lawyers try to beat a 2014 deadline
to bring claims related to the financial crisis.  Cases filed at the Commercial Court, where most business
disputes in the British capital are heard, reached 1,393 in the
year ending Sept. 30, law firm  Reynolds Porter Chamberlain LLP 
said in a statement.  Most legal disputes over contractual claims in the U.K.
must be filed within six years of an alleged breach. RPC, based
in  London , said the rise in claims is because it is more than
five years since the collapse of  Lehman Brothers  Holdings Inc.
in September 2008 roiled financial markets worldwide.  “The financial crisis exposed businesses to huge losses on
everything from complex financial transactions to the most
straightforward of commercial agreements,” said Geraldine
Elliott, a lawyer at RPC. “A lot of businesses are very busy
looking for ways to unpick transactions that lost their business
large sums of money after Lehman Brothers collapsed.”  An increase in wealthy foreigners bringing disputes to
London has also contributed to the rise, the report said.  Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk filed a suit in
London’s High Court in May against two other magnates from his
country over shares in an iron ore company. Russian billionaires
 Roman Abramovich  and Oleg Deripaska both defended claims brought
by former business partners at the U.K. courts in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
