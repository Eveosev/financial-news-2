London businesswoman Nicola Horlick
is planning to start a crowdfunding business named Money&Co
early next year that would help businesses to source financing
directly from investors, bypassing banks.  Horlick will become chief executive officer of the business
that will operate as a website, Money&Co said in a statement,
distributed via e-mail by MHP Communications.  “It is a smarter way for businesses to get the capital
they need and for people to get a better return on their cash,”
Horlick said in the statement. “At the moment, banks are not
doing enough for credit-worthy businesses.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government and the  Bank of
England  have sought to spur lending to companies after the
financial crisis led to a credit freeze. “Access to finance is
a significant and enduring problem for many small and medium-sized businesses,” the National Audit Office said in a report
on Nov. 1. Those may need an extra 22 billion pounds ($35
billion) of finance by 2017 on top of existing funding sources,
the NAO said.  The non-bank and alternative finance sector will provide
12.3 billion pounds of loans within a decade, Money&Co said,
citing an estimate by innovation charity Nesta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
