China ’s benchmark money-market rate
declined for a third day on speculation a cash squeeze will ease
as tax payments deposited at the monetary authority in October
flow back into the banking system.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of liquidity in the
financial system, climbed on Oct. 30 to the highest level since
a record cash crunch in June. Borrowing costs retreated as the
People’s Bank of China conducted reverse-repurchase agreements
to inject funds. The central bank’s money-market operations
added a net 29.1 billion  yuan  ($4.8 billion) to commercial banks
last week, after draining 102.5 billion yuan in the two weeks
ended Oct. 25,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Now that the rates have come down after last week’s
injections, the central bank may reduce the amount of reverse-repo sales this week, or even skip it,” said Chen Long, a bond
analyst at Bank of Dongguan. “The upcoming fiscal disbursement
in November and December will make the liquidity relatively
ample, and the PBOC will refrain from adding too much money into
the market.’  The  seven-day repo rate  declined 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 4.51 percent as of 11:13 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a daily fixing by the National Interbank Funding
Center. That was the lowest level since Oct. 23 and compares
with an average 3.95 percent this year. The overnight repo rate
slid 17 basis points to 4.19 percent.  The cost of one-year  interest-rate swaps , the fixed payment
needed to receive the floating seven-day repo, increased one
basis point to 4.16 percent.  The central bank asked lenders today to submit orders for
91-day bills, 28-day repurchase contracts, as well as seven- and
14-day reverse repos as usual, according to a trader at a
primary dealer required to bid at the auctions.  The yield on the 4.08 percent government bonds due August
2023 rose one basis point to 4.18 percent, according to data
provided by the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
