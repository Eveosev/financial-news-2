The average price of gasoline at the
pump for U.S. drivers fell to the lowest level of the year as
wide spreads between U.S. and European oil benchmarks have
driven American refiners to produce more fuel than ever for this
time of year.  The average retail price  fell  2.9 cents to $3.265 a gallon
in the week ended today, the lowest level since Dec. 4, the
Energy Information Administration reported on its website.
Prices are 22.7 cents below a year earlier.  U.S. refineries  produced  9.434 million barrels a day of
gasoline the week of Oct. 25, the highest seasonal level in
weekly EIA data going back to 1982. The discount of Light
Louisiana Sweet, the U.S. Gulf benchmark crude, to European
Brent, the internatonal benchmark, averaged $6.54 a barrel in
October, the widest on record, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The U.S. has finally let go of wanting and needing the
world’s benchmark in favor of great refining margins,” said
Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.
“You have to take advantage of the margins while they’re
here.”  Gasoline’s crack spread versus West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark for inland U.S. refineries, was $11.56 a barrel based
on  New York  Mercantile Exchange settlement prices. The fuel was
at a 5-cent discount versus Brent.  Rocky Mountains  Gasoline at the pump fell in all geographic regions. It
dropped most in the  Rocky Mountains , declining 6.1 cents to
$3.307 a gallon.  The lowest price was in the  Gulf Coast , where gasoline fell
4.2 cents to $3.03 a gallon. It’s the lowest level since Feb.
21, 2011.  The most expensive gasoline was on the West Coast, where
prices dropped 4.5 cents to $3.564 a gallon, the lowest price
since Jan. 28.  Prices on the East Coast fell 2.9 cents to $3.289 a gallon.
