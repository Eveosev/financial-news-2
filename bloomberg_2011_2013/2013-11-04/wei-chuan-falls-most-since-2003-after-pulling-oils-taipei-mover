Wei Chuan Foods Corp. (1201)  plunged the
most in more than a year after the Taiwanese food retailer said
it suspended the sale of some products amid a government probe
into the labeling of edible oils sold to consumers.  The stock fell by the maximum 7 percent daily limit before
closing down 5.4 percent at NT$52.80, the biggest decline since
October 2012. The company said yesterday it voluntarily removed
some edible-oil products from shelves due to concerns over the
sources of raw materials. The Taipei-based company said it would
cooperate with the government investigation, according to a
statement it filed with  Taiwan â€™s stock exchange.  Taiwan Premier Jiang Yi-huah said Nov. 1 the government
will improve systems to prevent substandard foods from reaching
the public, the Taipei-based  Central News Agency   reported . The
health ministry discovered cases where oil mixtures were labeled
as pure oils through tests on ingredients and additives in
cooking oils, the China Post  reported  Nov. 1.  As of yesterday, officials  discovered  129 products were in
breach of regulations out of 7,665 products tested in spot
checks around Taiwan, according to the Ministry of Health and
Welfare.  To contact the reporter on this story:
