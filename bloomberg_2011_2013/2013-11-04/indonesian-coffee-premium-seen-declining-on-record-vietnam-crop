Buyers of coffee from  Indonesia , the
third-largest robusta grower, are paying a smaller premium for
their beans as exporters sell on concern a record crop in
 Vietnam  will lead to lower prices, according to Volcafe Ltd.  Indonesian beans for shipment in November and December were
last week trading at a premium of $160 a metric ton to the price
on the NYSE Liffe exchange in London, the Winterthur,
Switzerland-based unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings
Ltd. said in a report e-mailed on Nov. 1. That compares with
$170 a week earlier, data from the trader showed.  “The drop in Indonesian premiums to below last week’s
levels suggests wary exporters want to sell before London
futures fall again due to a record crop in Vietnam,” according
to Volcafe.  Vietnam, the world’s leading producer of the robusta
variety used in instant drinks and espresso, will harvest a
record 29 million bags of coffee in the 2013-14 season that
started last month, estimates  Kona Haque , an analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd. Futures in London fell 22 percent this year
as traders anticipated ample Vietnamese supplies. A bag of
coffee usually weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Indonesia is selling its 2013-14 crop that started there in
April. Bean deliveries from farms were about 500 tons to 1,000
tons last week, according to the report. That’s down from 2,000
tons a week earlier, data from the trader showed. Local prices
were last week at 16,500 rupiah ($1.45) to 17,800 rupiah a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) compared with 18,000 to 19,500 rupiah in
the previous seven-day period, according to Volcafe.  ‘Watchful’ Eyes  In Vietnam, the new crop started one-to-two weeks earlier
than usual, the trader said. Farmers are rushing their
harvesting, “with watchful eyes on Liffe,” the trader said.
 Local prices  were at 30,200 dong ($1.43) a kilogram on Nov. 1,
the lowest since 2010, according to data from the Daklak Trade &
Tourism Center on Bloomberg.  The export market “moves slowly, most are short-covering
for nearby shipments,” Volcafe wrote. While differentials are
“historically firm,” harvest peak pressure “may oil the
wheels a bit in early December,” according to the trader.
Differentials refer to a discount obtained or a premium paid for
physical coffee in relation to futures prices.  Vietnamese beans for shipment in November and December were
last week at a premium of $60 a ton to the futures, according to
the report. That compares with $50 a ton a week earlier. Robusta
coffee futures gained 0.8 percent to $1,501 a ton by 4:12 p.m.
