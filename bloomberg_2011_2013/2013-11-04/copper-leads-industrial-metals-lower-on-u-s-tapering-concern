Copper led declines in industrial
metals, extending its losses to a third day, as Asian equity
markets slumped on speculation the Federal Reserves will begin
paring stimulus.  The metal for delivery in three months dropped as much as
0.7 percent to $7,197 a metric ton after gaining as much as 0.3
percent in early trade. It was at $7,208.75 at 1:23 p.m. in
 Shanghai . Nickel fell 0.5 percent, while lead and zinc lost
about 0.3 percent.  Asian stocks fell after Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President  Richard Fisher  said today in Sydney that the U.S.
central bank should end its record stimulus as soon as possible.
That removed some of the support from recent factory and
services gauges in  China  and a Nov. 1 report that showed the
U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index for
October climbed to the highest since April 2011.  “Investors have been torn between upbeat economic data and
the concern that the US will pare monetary stimulus,” said
Sijin Cheng, an analyst at Barclays Plc in Singapore.  Futures for delivery in December fell 0.6 percent to
$3.2790 a pound on the Comex in  New York . The metal for delivery
in January on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 1.2 percent to
51,630  yuan  ($8,460) a ton.  On the LME, aluminum rose from the lowest in almost a month
on signs of factory demand in the world’s top two metals users,
and as Alcoa Inc. planned output cuts. The three-month contract
rose 0.2 percent to $1,847 a ton after reaching an intra-day
high of $1,850.75.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
