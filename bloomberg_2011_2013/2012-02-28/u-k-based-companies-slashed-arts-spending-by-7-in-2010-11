U.K.-based companies slashed arts
spending by 7 percent in 2010-11, the fourth consecutive annual
decline, a U.K. charity said today.  Business investment dropped to 134.2 million pounds ($212.4
million) in the year ended March 31, 2011, according to  Arts &
Business , an organization that links cultural institutions with
donors. That’s lower than the total for 2004-5, the charity said
in an e-mailed news release.  “These figures reveal that there remains an acute need to
drive increased private investment into the arts,” said
Jonathan Moulds, president of  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s European
unit, who chairs the Arts & Business Leadership Campaign. “The
arts are not an optional extra.”  The Arts & Business annual survey showed that a total of
686 million pounds was given by companies, individuals, and
trusts and foundations to the arts in 2010-11, an increase of 4
percent in real terms from the previous year.  Donations by individuals rose 6 percent, and contributions
from trusts and foundations increased 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
