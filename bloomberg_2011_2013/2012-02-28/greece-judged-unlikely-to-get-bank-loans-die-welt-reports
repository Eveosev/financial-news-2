Large banks won’t lend money to
 Greece  anytime soon, given the losses they’ve incurred,  Die Welt 
said, citing a confidential report by the  Institute of
International Finance  that it obtained.  The financial industry may also be less willing to lend to
 Portugal , Ireland, and  Spain  in the coming months, given that
these countries are struggling to meet savings goals, the
newspaper cited the report as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
