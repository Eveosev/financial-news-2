American Airlines  was sued by its
pilots’ union, which is seeking to block the airline from
rejecting a labor agreement and forcing new employment terms on
the union because the contract has expired.  American parent  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  can’t use its bankruptcy case to
reject the collective bargaining agreement because the contract
expired in 2008, the Allied Pilots Association said in a
complaint filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in New York.  American, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, filed for bankruptcy
in November, saying its cost structure wasn’t competitive with
other airlines. Companies can use bankruptcy to reject labor
contracts with unions to cut costs.  “It is unfortunate that APA has resorted so quickly to
litigation rather than focusing on the bargaining table where
there are pressing economic issues to be resolved,” Bruce Hicks, an  American Airlines (AMR)  spokesman, said in a statement.  The union said in its court filing that it wants to
continue negotiations with American under a National Mediation
Board process.  The pilots’ suit is Allied Pilots Association v. AMR Corp.,
12-01094, and the full bankruptcy case is In re AMR Corp.,
11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
