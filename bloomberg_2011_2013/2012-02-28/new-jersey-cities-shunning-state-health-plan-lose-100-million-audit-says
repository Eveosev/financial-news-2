New Jersey (STONJ1)  cities and towns are
missing out on more than $100 million in health-care savings by
not joining the state’s insurance plan, according to an audit
released today.  Four municipalities passed up almost $12.6 million in
savings by forgoing the  State Health Benefits Plan  in favor of
other options, the audit from Comptroller Matthew Boxer shows.
The report focused on Essex County, home to  Newark , as well as
the townships of Brick, East Brunswick and Haddon.  The four local governments would have avoided a combined
$1.1 million in insurance-broker fees by joining the state plan
in 2009 and 2010, the years studied by the audit. On average,
the total savings would have been $1,007 for each enrollee in
2009 and $979 in 2010, according to the report.  “Health coverage for public employees is an area in which
substantial savings can be realized for taxpayers,” Boxer said
in a statement accompanying the report. He estimated that if all
 New Jersey ’s local governments participated in the state plan,
the amount would exceed $100 million a year.  The communities examined have a combined population of more
than 921,200, and the number covered by municipal health
insurance was more than 6,300. Essex County would have saved the 
most, at about $9.57 million over the two years, according to the 
report.  Hard to Do  In a written response to the audit,  Essex County (10176MF) 
Administrator Ralph J. Ciallella said it’s impossible for the
county to move toward a complete change-over to the state plan,
citing union contracts and rulings from the courts and
arbitrators over benefits.  The state plan was set up in 1961 to provide health
insurance to qualified public workers. Under a pension and
benefits overhaul signed into law last year by Governor  Chris Christie , a Republican, all public employees are required to
contribute more of their salaries for medical coverage based on
the cost of the plans.  The new requirement is being phased in over several years
and contributions are based upon salary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
