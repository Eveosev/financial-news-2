Bouygues SA (EN) , the French building,
television and telecommunications company, reported a 2011
profit that beat  analyst estimates  and said revenue this year
will fall by 1 percent, led by its mobile-phone business.  Operating profit excluding one-time items climbed 3 percent
to 1.82 billion euros ($2.45 billion), the Paris-based company
said in a statement today, beating an average estimate of 1.79
billion euros from 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sales, which rose by 5 percent to 32.7 billion euros in
2011, may fall to 32.35 billion euros this year as revenue at
Bouygues Telecom, France’s third-largest mobile-phone operator,
may recede by 10 percent to 5.14 billion euros, Bouygues said.  The company said it will implement “cost savings” at
Bouygues Telecom this year to adapt to the arrival of Iliad SA
on  France ’s mobile phone market at the start of 2012, and as a
planned cut in so-called call-termination rates will shave about
350 million euros in revenue.  Bouygues will pay a  dividend  of 1.60 euros per share in
2012, unchanged from a year earlier. That’s after net income was
unchanged from 2010 at 1.07 billion euros. The company said its
stake in Alstom SA added 190 million euros to net income last
year, down from 235 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
