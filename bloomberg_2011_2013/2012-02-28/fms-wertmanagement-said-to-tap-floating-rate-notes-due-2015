FMS Wertmanagement is adding to its
floating-rate notes due in February 2015, according to a banker
involved in the transaction.  The new notes may be priced to yield about 10 basis points
more than Euribor, the banker said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Natixis, UBS AG and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are managing the tap.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
