Indonesia ’s  Supreme Court  restored
cleric Abu Bakar Bashir’s 15-year prison term, reversing a High
Court decision that reduced it to nine years, confirming a
 report  published in the Jakarta Globe today.  “The lower court’s decision was not supported by adequate
considerations,” Supreme Court Spokesman Djoko Sarwoko said by
phone in Jakarta today.  Bashir was found guilty in June of funding terrorism by
contributing funds to an Islamic militant training camp in Aceh
province, five years after his acquittal for links to bombings
that killed 202 people on the resort island of Bali. He was
sentenced to 15 years in prison. The 73-year-old preacher had
been proved legally and convincingly guilty of committing a
criminal act of terrorism, South Jakarta district Chief Judge
Herry Swantoro said at that time.  The  High Court  reduced Bashir’s sentence to nine years on
appeal in October because it found no evidence the funds were
used for the training camp in Aceh, Ahmad Sobari, a spokesman at
the court, said by phone in Jakarta today.  If Bashir objected to the Supreme Court’s decision, he
could file a review, Sarwoko said, adding that there wasn’t any
pressure during the decision making.  To contact the reporter on this story:
