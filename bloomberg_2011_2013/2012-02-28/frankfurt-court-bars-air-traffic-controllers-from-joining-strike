Frankfurt airport’s air traffic
controllers have been barred from striking in support of ground
control workers by a labor court in the city.  A solidarity strike would be “disproportionate,” the
court said in an e-mailed statement, as it approved an
injunction requested by Fraport AG,  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and
DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH against the Gewerkschaft der
Flugsicherung union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
