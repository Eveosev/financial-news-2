Most Chinese stocks fell as some
investors speculated this year’s rally in equities was excessive
relative to earnings growth prospects.  More than five stocks declined for every three that rose in
the Shanghai Composite Index, which was little changed at
2,446.57. The gauge closed at its the highest level since Nov.
17 yesterday. The CSI 300 Index gained 0.1 percent to 2,659.4.
The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index, the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, lost 0.7 percent in  New York .  “The run-up is a bit fast and the pressure for a
correction is increasing,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund
manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million.
“The market needs a break here and we also need to see coming
economic data will be good to justify the rally. Trading will be
volatile going forward.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
