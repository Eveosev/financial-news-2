Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de
Bogota SA , the phone company serving  Colombia ’s capital, fell
for a second day after the board of directors said it will
propose to withhold dividends to fund expansion plans.  ETB, as the company is known, dropped 2.7 percent to 477
pesos at 4 p.m. Bogota time. The stock earlier fell as much as 8
percent, the most since July 25.  “The market could be reacting this way because last year’s
dividend was pretty good,” said Angelica Dominguez, a Medellin-
based analyst at Bolsa y Renta SA. “There are people that
bought the share just thinking about the dividend, and those are
probably the ones making the share fall quickly today.”  ETB’s board will propose in a March 28 shareholders meeting
that the company not pay a dividend in order to boost investment
in a two-year strategic plan aimed at “seeking new lines of
business and modernizing the company,” according to a
regulatory filing late yesterday. The company paid a dividend of
36.3 pesos (2 cents) per share last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
