Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNI) , the
railroad that  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  bought in
2010, and H.J. Heinz Co. are among borrowers selling bonds as
investment-grade yields fall to the lowest on record.  Burlington Northern may issue 10- and 30-year notes in
benchmark size, typically at least $500 million, said a person
with knowledge of the offering. Ketchup-maker Heinz may sell
$600 million of notes, a separate person said. Both people
declined to be identified as terms aren’t set. Phone operator
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  is also planning a $2 billion bond sale.  The companies are accessing  capital markets  as borrowing
costs for investment-grade issuers tumble to 3.44 percent as of
yesterday, the lowest in data going back to October 1986,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Investor demand for
the assets is increasing as the Federal Reserve pledges to hold
 interest rates  near zero percent through at least late 2014 and
European debt woes increase the appeal of safer assets.  Burlington Northern, based in  Fort Worth ,  Texas , last sold
bonds in August, issuing $300 million of 4.95 percent, 30-year
bonds and $450 million of 3.45 percent, 10-year notes, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heinz sold $700 million of notes in September in its first
offering since July 2009, Bloomberg data show. The Pittsburgh-
based company split the sale between $300 million of 2 percent,
five-year notes and $400 million of 3.125 percent, 10-year
notes, the data show.  Deutsche Telekom,  Germany ’s largest phone company, may
offer $1 billion of five-year notes that yield 153 basis points
more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries and $1 billion of 30-
year debt that pays a spread of 190 basis, said a person with
knowledge of the offering, who declined to be identified because
terms aren’t set. The Bonn-based company last accessed the
dollar bond market in April, selling $1.25 billion of five-year
notes, Bloomberg data show.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
