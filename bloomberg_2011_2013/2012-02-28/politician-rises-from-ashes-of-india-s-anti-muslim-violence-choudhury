Feb. 28 marks the 10th anniversary of the last major outbreak of organized religious violence in  India . Indeed, the  riots in the western state of Gujarat  in February and March 2002 might be said to be the last major episode of communal hatred in which the state was conspicuously an agent. The violence began in the small town of Godhra on Feb. 27, 2002, when 58 Hindu pilgrims were killed when a train compartment in which they were travelling was set on fire, allegedly by a Muslim mob. When the news of the incident spread through Gujarat, not only were the state’s Hindus inflamed, the streets of many parts of Gujarat were besieged by  right-wing groups  that saw the moment as being ripe to attack members of the state’s substantial Muslim minority. By all accounts, the administration of the state’s chief minister,  Narendra Modi  of the  Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) , then only five months into his tenure, did little to curb the violence. Muslim neighborhoods and buildings in the state’s biggest city, Ahmedabad, were attacked, buildings set on fire, women raped, and people burned alive or hacked to pieces. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in the violence and by the police. Modi never apologized for the carnage -- some have plausibly termed it  genocide  -- that took place under his watch. In state elections the next year he ran an inflammatory campaign, littered with anti-Muslim innuendo, that won a clear mandate from the state’s voters, even as thousands of Muslims displaced by the violence continued to suffer in ghettos in the state. Ten years later, Modi's power is ever more firmly entrenched, and has refashioned himself as a modernizer committed to good governance and economic development, with an eye to running for prime minister in the general elections of 2014. When questioned about the violence of 2002 today, he prefers to bat away such queries as an attempt to defame not just himself, but the entire state of Gujarat ( last year he launched a large-scale campaign  celebrating his reign when the Supreme Court opened a window of hope for him in a case related to the riots). The violence of 2002 offers sobering lessons for all Indians to contemplate: On the legacy of bloodshed in Hindu-Muslim riots spanning several centuries, and spiraling in the million or more killed during the  Partition of India  in 1947; on the tendency of democracy in India to transform into its evil doppelganger, majoritarianism; on the perils (and for people of a certain mindset, pleasures) of voting in governments insufficiently committed and indeed ideologically opposed to the idea of secularism enshrined in the Indian Constitution; on the tendency of large sections of Indian society to interpret, and on occasion implement, the idea of justice through the lens of collective categories (“the Hindus,” “the Muslims”); on the power of the mass media to fan communal violence by the repeated circulation of images of rioting or of partisan opinion; and on  the question of reconciliation  after religious violence and the ominous nature of post-violence “peace” -- a peace claimed by Modi and his party as a sign that all is now well in Gujarat and the riots of 2002 were merely a spasm, to be forgotten. Indeed, on Feb. 26, a day before the anniversary of the violence,  Modi posted the following on Twitter : "Disturbing elements trying to create rift in Guj won’t succeed as Guj has laid strong foundation of peace in a decade." In a wide-angle view of the violence and its implications, Saba Naqvi and Smruti Koppikar asked in Outlook, in an essay called “ A Beast Asleep? ,” if such violence was possible again: And in perhaps the best essay on the anniversary, the sociologist  Shiv Visvanathan interpreted the riots soberly and chillingly  by looking at the actual objects and technologies used in the massacres: Visvanathan also refuted the claim made by many of those sympathetic to Modi that what is past is past, and that the chief minister should now be allowed to get on with his declared goal of “Vikas” or “development”: And he was echoed by the political scientist  Christophe Jaffrelot , author of an influential study on the rise of the Hindu right-wing movement in India, in the Indian Express: And the monthly The Caravan devoted more than 18,000 words to a profile of Modi in its March issue, supplying many unknown facts and stories about his rise. The journalist Vinod Jose argued, in " The Emperor Uncrowned ," that “The story of Narendra Modi is also the story of a series of organisations under which he was nurtured and trained; it is the story of the political rise of those organisations in the past half-century, and the rise of Modi within their ranks.” He also revealingly linked Modi’s stance in 2002 to the larger climate of hostility toward Islam that had broken out across the world after Sept. 11: It’s clear, though, that while much of the debate about the violence of 2002 takes Modi as its center, doing so often has the consequence of activating the polarized views on Gujarat’s chief minister, and ending all reasoned argument, often to the benefit of Modi’s supporters. A Modi-centered approach to the violence makes invisible or minimizes the many complex issues at stake in the matter, including the dismaying absence of remorse on the part of the Gujarati citizenry, as well as the failure, by and large, so far of the Gujarat legal system and state administration to deliver justice for the victims of the 2002 violence. As Jaffrelot said in a long essay in The Economic and Political Weekly titled " Gujarat 2002: What Justice For The Victims? ": With Gujarat set to hold elections at the end of 2012, this is a year in which the state’s citizenry, and not just its controversial chief minister, of whom difficult questions must be asked. Is something rotten in the state of  Mahatma Gandhi ? The answer seems ever more clearly to be yes. (Chandrahas Choudhury, a novelist, is the New Delhi correspondent for the World View blog.
