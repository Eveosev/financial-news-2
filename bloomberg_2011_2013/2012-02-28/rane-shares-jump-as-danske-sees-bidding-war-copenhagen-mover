Thrane & Thrane A/S (THRAN) , the world’s
largest maker of communications equipment using  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT) ’s
network, jumped to a record-high in Copenhagen trading after
Danske Bank A/S predicted multiple buyers may make bids.  Thrane rose as much as 9.5 percent to 405 kroner, the
highest since its 2001 initial public offering. The stock
advanced 33 kroner, or 8.9 percent, to 403 kroner at 10:12 a.m.
in the Danish capital.  Thrane, whose products include communication terminals used
by the Danish army, said yesterday it received a non-binding and
unsolicited approach from a possible buyer seeking a majority
stake. Danske today raised its recommendation on the share to
“buy” from “hold” and increased its price estimate on the
shares by 43 percent, saying the company looks set to become
part of an industry consolidation.  “If an offer materializes, we believe the offer price
would be at least in the 450-krone per share level to reflect
future opportunities,” the Copenhagen-based bank said today in
a note to clients. “We see the possibility of a bidding war, as
we believe there are several potential bidders.”  Lars Thrane, founder of the Lyngby, Denmark-based company,
won’t sell his 24 percent stake to the firm that expressed
interest in buying, newspaper Borsen quoted him as saying today.
The company has hired FIH Capital Partners to identify other
buyers as part of its strategic review, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
