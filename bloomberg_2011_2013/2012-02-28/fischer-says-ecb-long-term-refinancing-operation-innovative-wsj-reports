Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said the  European Central Bank ’s longer-term refinancing
operation is “creative and innovative” and gives confidence in
its crisis-fighting ability, the Wall Street Journal reported.  “It is possible that at some point in the future the ECB
may have to consider doing even more than they have done so
far,” Fischer said, according to the newspaper, which cited an
interview. “The fact that they implemented the LTRO, which is
creative and innovative, makes us think that, faced with a
future challenge, they will be able to deal with it,” the
Journal cited Fischer as saying.  Financial markets don’t foresee a change in the Bank of
Israel’s  benchmark  interest rate in the next 12 months, Fischer
told the paper before the Jerusalem-based central bank kept
borrowing costs unchanged yesterday, according to the Journal.
The governor said he’s not “looking” at succeeding  Robert Zoellick  as World Bank president when Zoellick’s five-year
mandate ends June 30, the paper reported.  Fischer said in a Feb. 20 Bloomberg News interview in
 Jerusalem  that “nobody should be relaxing at this stage” and
that “it’s too early to tell” if the worst is over for the
global economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
