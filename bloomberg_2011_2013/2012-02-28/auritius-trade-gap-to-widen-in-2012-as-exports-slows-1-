Mauritius said its 2012 trade gap
will probably widen as exports slow.  The deficit is forecast to reach 92 billion rupees ($3.2
billion), up from 72.2 billion rupees in 2011, the Port Louis-
based Statistics Mauritius said  on its website  today. Imports
will jump 16 percent to 172 billion rupees and exports will rise
5.4 percent to 80 billion rupees, it said.  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation with a population
of about 1.3 million people, is a net importer of food and
fuels. India is the largest supplier, with  Mangalore Refinery &
Petrochemical Ltd (MRPL)  providing all its fuel.  Exports to  Europe , which account for 62 percent of the
total, rose 2.7 percent to 40.4 billion rupees in 2011 and
declined 10 percent in the fourth quarter, the agency said.  The rupee has gained 1.9 percent against the dollar, the
main currency for its imports bills. Against the euro, it has
weakened 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
