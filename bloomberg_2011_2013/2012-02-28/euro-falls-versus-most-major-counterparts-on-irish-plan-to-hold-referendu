The euro fell against most of its
major counterparts after Ireland said it will hold a referendum
to ratify the European fiscal compact, increasing concern the
measure may face resistance.  The 17-nation currency earlier rose against the dollar as
the  European Central Bank  prepared to allot three-year loans
tomorrow to improve the liquidity of the region’s banks. Higher-
yielding currencies, led by Norway’s krone, advanced after a
U.S. report showed  consumer confidence  in the world’s largest
economy improved this month. The pound rose against the euro
after an index of U.K. retail sales climbed.  “The risk is that the vote goes against it,” said Kit Juckes, head of foreign-exchange research at Societe Generale SA
in  London . “Bears will see this as a pin to burst the bubble of
complacency about Europe that has peripheral bonds doing
better.”  The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3416 at 10:37 a.m. in New
York after earlier rising as much as 0.5 percent. The common
currency weakened 0.4 percent to 7.4830 Norwegian krone. The
dollar rose 0.1 percent to 80.68 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
