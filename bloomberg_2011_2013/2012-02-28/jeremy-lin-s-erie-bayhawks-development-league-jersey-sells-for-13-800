The jersey that Jeremy Lin wore in
his lone game for the Erie BayHawks, the National Basketball
Association Development League team that’s partnered with the
 New York Knicks , was auctioned for $13,800.  Lin, a Harvard University graduate, was cut by two other
NBA teams before joining the Knicks and emerging as a starter
and an international sensation. The NBA’s first Chinese- or
Taiwanese-American player, he’s led the Knicks to a 9-3 record
since taking over at point guard.  Lin was sent to the D-League last month and had a triple-
double in his only game with the BayHawks, recording 28 points,
12 assists and 11 rebounds in a Jan. 20 win against the Maine
Red Claws. The  BayHawks  made almost $20,000 by auctioning off
three of Lin’s jerseys on  eBay Inc. ’s website.  Lin’s game-worn jersey sold for $13,800, his shooting
jersey was auctioned for $3,750 and his practice jersey went for
$1,914, according to the  Times-News of Erie ,  Pennsylvania .  The BayHawks also have planned a “Lin-Sanity” night for
March 3 when they play the  Sioux Falls Skyforce . The first 1,000
fans will receive a poster featuring Lin and many fans will be
admitted for free -- including Harvard students and alumni, fans
with a variation of “Lin” in their name and all 17 year olds,
in honor of Lin’s jersey number.  “Erie and the NBA Development League have been
beneficiaries of his story being told in the national media,”
BayHawks President Matt Bresee said in a  statement . “It’s
fitting to celebrate his success with a night dedicated to
him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
