Russia , the world’s biggest  oil 
producer, will raise its  export duty  on most crude shipments by
4.4 percent from March 1 following an increase in the price of
the country’s Urals blend.  The standard duty will climb to $411.20 a metric ton, or
$56.10 a barrel, from $393.70 a ton in February, according to a
 decree  signed by Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  and published
today in the official government newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta.  The discounted rate on some Eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea oil will climb to $204.40 a ton from $191.20.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
 Urals (EUCRURNW) , Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged $112.22 a
barrel during the most recent period, according to the  Finance
Ministry , up from $108.23 in the previous period.  The government lowered the crude  tax rate  in October,
applying a coefficient of 60 percent, down from 65 percent, and
unified the duty on most refined products at 66 percent of that
levy.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products will
rise to $271.40 a ton next month, from $259.80 in February.  A gasoline tax that Putin imposed in May to counter
domestic shortages will increase to $370.10 a ton from $354.30
this month. That is 90 percent of the crude oil duty. The
government will lower the duty on liquefied petroleum gases such
as butane and propane to $157.30 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
