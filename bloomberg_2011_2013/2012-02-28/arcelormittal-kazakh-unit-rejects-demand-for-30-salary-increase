ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s Kazakh unit rejected
a call by workers for a 30 percent pay increase because of
weaker demand for steel products and the need to set aside funds
to upgrade its plants.  The labor unions representing AO ArcelorMittal Temirtau’s
35,300-person workforce have declined the latest wage offer from
management to adjust salaries for inflation and discuss other
increases after a sales target for rolled steel is reached, the
unit of the world’s biggest steelmaker said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “Protest actions and meetings won’t help to fulfil the
company’s production tasks and solve the issue of the wage
increase,” Vijay Mahadevan, the general director of
ArcelorMittal Temirtau, said in the statement.  The company has been in talks with its workers over pay
raises since October, according to the statement. Demands for
salary increases by oil workers in western  Kazakhstan  triggered
strikes and violence last year, leading to the death of 16
people after police used arms to suppress unrest in Zhanaozen
during Independence Day celebrations on Dec. 16.  Employees of ArcelorMittal’s Kazakh unit condemned the
riots in a Dec. 18 letter, criticizing “statements that
disguise the events as a labor fight.”  The labor union plans a meeting to demand higher salaries,
Roman Ilto, a Temirtau-based spokesman for the company, said by
phone today. ArcelorMittal Temirtau faces difficulties with the
sale of rolled steel products after orders dropped at the end of
last year, Ilto said, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
