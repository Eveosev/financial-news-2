Yandex NV (YNDX) ’s mobile software
developer SPB Software is introducing a “three-dimensional”
user interface for tablets running  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android
operating system as it seeks to broaden its reach in the mobile
market.  The Shell 3D Tablet Edition offers a carousel design which
allows users to see panels of all of their applications and
widgets in three dimensions, according to a statement released
today by Yandex,  Russia ’s most popular Internet search engine
and owner of SPB Software.  With mobile operators now offering tablets with broadband
access as well as mobile phones and smartphones, the market for
specialized tablet-tailored software is growing, Sebastian-
Justus Schmidt, general manager of Yandex Mobile said, according
to the statement.  Global sales of tablets are expected to reach  326 million  a
year by 2015, according to Gartner Inc., a Stamford,
Connecticut-based research company. Sales of tablets probably
increased to 63.6 million units in 2011, compared with 17.6
million in 2010, according to Gartner.  Yandex -- which saw its share of the Russian search market
drop to 59.3 percent this calendar month to Feb. 27, from 59.6
percent in January, according to  Liveintenet.ru  -- is making
mobile development one of its priorities, spokesman Ochir
Mandzhikov said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
