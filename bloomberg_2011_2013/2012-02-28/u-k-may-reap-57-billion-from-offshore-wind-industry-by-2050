The U.K. government estimated that
the offshore wind industry may contribute more than 35 billion
pounds ($57 billion) to the economy by 2050 if the cost of the
technology is cut quickly enough.  The industry must cut costs 25 percent by 2020 and pare the
estimated 3.1 million pounds per megawatt needed to pay for  wind
turbines  installed offshore, according to a report published by
the Department of Energy and Climate Change in London today.  Capturing 5 percent to 10 percent of the global market
would bring investments and business to the U.K. that contribute
to gross domestic product, the department said in the  Offshore
Wind Power  report.  The U.K. plans to install 18 gigawatts of turbines at sea
by 2020, up from about 2 gigawatts now. Itâ€™s aiming to obtain 15
percent of its energy from renewable sources and replace aging
power plants.  The government awarded 1.2 million pounds to British
company David Brown Gear Systems Ltd. to develop a gearbox for a
7-megawatt offshore turbine made by Samsung Heavy Industries Co.
as part of efforts to expand the industry to reduce costs.  Government intervention as well as private money is needed
to overcome hurdles including lack of test facilities and
insufficient payback on early-stage research and development,
the report said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
