Japanese stocks rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  surging in the last half hour of
trading today after the yen pared gains, boosting the outlook
for exporters’ earnings.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a consumer-electronics maker that earns about
70 percent of its revenue overseas, gained 0.7 percent. Mobile
carrier  Softbank (9984)  Corp. jumped 3.2 percent before the government
awards communications spectrum tomorrow.  Elpida (6665)  Memory Inc.
plunged by its daily limit after the chipmaker yesterday filed
for Japan’s biggest bankruptcy in two years.  “The stock markets are being swayed by the currency,”
said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “They are buying back shares as
the yen weakens from just 80 yen.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.9 percent to 9,722.52
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo  after falling as much as 1.1
percent earlier today. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index rose 0.4 percent
to 838.48, extending a six-month high.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  gained 0.3
percent today. The gauge rose 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday
on better-than-estimated home sales and as financial shares
rallied.  Yen Pares Gains  Exporters rebounded after the yen pared gains against the
dollar to 80.53 at the close of  stock trading  today from as low
as 80.02 earlier.  Sony gained 0.7 percent to 1,773 yen, reversing a 2.3
percent drop.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Japan’s biggest carmaker,
added 0.2 percent to 3,385 yen after falling as much as 1.2
percent earlier.  Stocks rose even as Greece’s credit ratings were cut to
“selective default” by  Standard & Poor’s  yesterday after the
debt-strapped nation negotiated the biggest sovereign debt
restructuring in history.  Information and communication companies gained the most
among the Topix’s 33 industry groups after the government said
it will choose the winner of the 900-megahertz spectrum license
auction tomorrow.  Softbank Rises  Among the bidders, Softbank rallied 3.2 percent to 2,435
yen, and KDDI Corp. rose 2.2 percent to 518,000 yen.  Elpida declined the most among the Topix’s 1,668 companies
after filing for  bankruptcy protection  with 448 billion yen of
debt. The manufacturer of dynamic random access memory chips
plunged by its daily limit of 80 yen, or 24 percent, to 254 yen.
Elpida will be delisted on March 28, according to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.  The bankruptcy “came as a surprise because people expected
the government to support  Japan ’s only DRAM maker,” Shinkin
Asset’s Fujiwara said.  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen 6.6 percent since Feb. 14, when the
Bank of Japan increasing its government-bond purchases,
weakening the yen. The gain has boosted the  value  of stocks
listed on the Topix to 1.03 times estimated book value, up from
0.88 in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
number below 1 means companies can be bought for less than value
of their assets.  -- With assistance from Toshiro Hasegawa in Tokyo. Editors:  Jim Powell , Jason Clenfield.  To contact the reporters on this story:
