Ukrainian sunflower planting may
rise to a record 5.5 million hectares (13.6 million acres) this
year, UkrAgroConsult said, increasing its own 5.3 million-
hectare forecast made a week ago.  The projection takes account of “winter crops condition
and forecast for spring reseeding,” the Kiev-based agricultural
researcher said yesterday in an e-mailed report. The estimate
compares with seeding on 5.25 million hectares in 2011,
according to statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
