Gasoline fell the most since
December as declines in durable goods orders and  home prices 
raised concern about the pace of the U.S. economic recovery and
fuel demand.  Futures dropped 2.8 percent, after rising 17 percent this
year through Feb. 24, as  bookings  for goods meant to last at
least three years slumped 4 percent in January, the most since
2009, Commerce Department data showed. The S&P/Case-Shiller
 index  of property values in 20 cities sank 4 percent in December
from a year earlier.  “There had been such an influx of bullish news, and all of
a sudden it stops, and you say, ‘let’s take profit,’” said
 Michael Smith , president of T&K Futures & Options in Port Saint
Lucie,  Florida .  Gasoline for March delivery fell 8.82 cents to settle at
$3.0401 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
have gained 13 percent in 2012.  “We’re just taking a breather today,” Smith said.
“Gasoline could go down another 10 cents without breaking the
uptrend.”  Orders for durables, excluding transportation equipment,
decreased 3.2 percent, the most since October 2010, after a 2.1
percent rise. Home prices fell to the lowest level since the
housing crisis began in mid-2006.  “Last week’s strong rally basically overextended itself,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in Stamford,  Connecticut . “Durable goods orders show that,
while we might be seeing signs of improvement in the economy,
it’s not all blue skies.”  Inventory Estimates  Gasoline  inventories  probably fell 425,000 barrels last
week, according to the median estimate of 12 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg News. Distillate stockpiles declined 750,000
barrels while supplies of crude oil rose 1.1 million, according
to the survey.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Demand at the pump was 6.9 percent below year-earlier
levels last week, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA) ’s Spending Pulse
report today. It was the biggest year-over-year decrease since
Feb. 12, 2010.  “Gas prices are on everybody’s mind and demand for
gasoline has been nothing but poor,”  said Ray Carbone,
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  “You’re
seeing some long liquidation today.”  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1.8
cents to $3.716 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.
Prices, which have increased 43.8 cents this year, were 10
percent higher than a year earlier.  March-delivery heating oil declined 6.26 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $3.2238 a gallon on the exchange. Prices
have gained 9.8 percent so far in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
