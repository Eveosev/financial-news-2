The  Portuguese government  said the
third review of the nation’s international aid program was
completed “successfully,” allowing the country to receive the
next rescue payment.  “The adjustment we are carrying out is unprecedented in
 Portugal ,” Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said at a press
conference in Lisbon today.  Gaspar said the government forecasts gross domestic product
will drop 3.3 percent this year, the same as forecast by the
European Commission. The country’s  economic growth  has averaged
less than 1 percent a year for the past decade, placing it among
 Europe ’s weakest performers.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending and
raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($105
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal
followed Greece and Ireland in April in seeking a bailout and
now aims to return to bond markets in 2013.  Passos Coelho on Feb. 17 reaffirmed that his government
will not ask for more time or more money as it implements the
financial aid program.  Portugal narrowed its  budget deficit  to about 4 percent of
GDP in 2011 following the transfer of banks’ pension funds to
the state. The government expects the shortfall will reach 4.5
percent in 2012 and the EU ceiling of 3 percent in 2013, after
hitting 9.8 percent in 2010.  Portuguese government debt is projected to “stabilize” at
112 percent of GDP in 2013 after reaching 111 percent in 2012
and 101.6 percent last year, the commission forecast in
November. Debt was 93.3 percent of GDP in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
