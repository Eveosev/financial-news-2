Texas A&M  University and the
 University of  Missouri  will sacrifice a combined $25.3 million
as part of an agreement to leave the Big 12 conference for the
 Southeastern Conference  on July 1.  Big 12  officials said in a  statement  yesterday that they
will withhold an estimated $12.4 million from Texas A&M’s
projected distribution for this year. The school will still get
a portion of the proceeds the league received from the signing
of its television contract with Fox Sports.  The conference said it will withhold  $12.4 million  in
revenues set to go to Missouri, which agreed to waive any claim
to benefits from the Big 12 television deal. Missouri also
agreed to pay the conference $500,000 for its share of
officiating expenses for the 2011-12 athletic year.  “We are pleased to have these issues resolved and we wish
the Big 12 and its continuing member institutions the best in
the future,” Missouri Chancellor Brady Deaton said.  The departures of Missouri and  Texas A&M  for the  SEC  came a
year after Nebraska left the Big 12 for the  Big Ten  and  Colorado 
exited to join the  Pacific 12 . The Big 12 is adding West
Virginia and Texas Christian next season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
