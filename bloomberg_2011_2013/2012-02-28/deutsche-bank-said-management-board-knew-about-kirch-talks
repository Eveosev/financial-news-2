Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  said the management
board was informed about talks held with the heirs of media
entrepreneur  Leo Kirch  over a potential settlement in the 10-
year-old legal dispute between the two sides.  “Of course the management boards knew beforehand about the
talks,” Detlev Rahmsdorf, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said
in an interview today. Members of the bank’s legal department
were involved in the talks with the Kirch side, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
