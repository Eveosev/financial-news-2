Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government takes credit for quashing debate about joint euro-
area bonds as part of its drive to make countries reduce debt,
said  Peter Altmaier , a senior coalition lawmaker.  “We have shoved the debate on euro bonds where it belongs
now and for the foreseeable future: into the broom closet,”
Altmaier, the parliamentary whip for Merkel’s  Christian
Democratic Union , told reporters in Berlin today.  “Step by step in the recent weeks and months, we have
built up a majority across Europe for the convictions held by
the chancellor and the coalition,” Altmaier said.  Common bonds as a way to stem Europe’s debt crisis and
preserve the 17-nation monetary union have support from southern
nations including Greece and  Italy  as well as Luxembourg and
Belgium. Merkel opposes euro bonds, saying they would paper over
differences in competitiveness in the euro area and ease
pressure for budget cuts in the most-indebted nations.  “My belief is that we have to take our cue from the best
in Europe” Merkel said in renewing her rejection of joint bonds
on Feb. 7 in Berlin. “Mediocrity isn’t enough” to compete in
the global economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
