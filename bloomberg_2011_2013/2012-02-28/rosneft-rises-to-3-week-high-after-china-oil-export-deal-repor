OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  climbed to the highest
intraday level in three weeks after Kommersant reported Russia’s
biggest oil company and OAO  Transneft (TRNF) , the state-owned pipeline
operator, ended a dispute with  China National Petroleum Corp (CNPZ) .
that has lasted for more than a year.  Rosneft added as much as 1.3 percent to 229.20 rubles, its
strongest intraday level since Feb. 7, before paring its advance
to 0.5 percent as of 10:39 a.m. in Moscow. Transneft was little
changed at 52,549 rubles.  The Russian companies cut the price of oil exports by $1.50
a barrel in the amended supply deal with CNPC, which agreed to
pay $134 million in overdue debt, according to the Russian
newspaper, which cited unidentified people with knowledge of the
negotiations.  Rosneft’s press office didn’t immediately answer when
called by Bloomberg News. Transneft spokesman Igor Dyomin
declined to comment.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
