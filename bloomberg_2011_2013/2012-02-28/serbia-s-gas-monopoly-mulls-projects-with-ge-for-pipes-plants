Srbijagas,  Serbia ’s national gas
company, discussed with  General Electric Co. (GE)  the possible
cooperation on pipelines and gas-fired plants in the Balkan
country.  State-owned Srbijagas met with GE officials on “joint
projects” such as “gas plants, pipelines, interconnections to
Romania and Bulgaria, compressor pumps for the South Stream,
underground gas depots” and a liquefied natural gas terminal
east of Belgrade, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  “Forms of investments and positioning of the American
company were discussed” as GE executives for eastern Europe
gave a presentation at Srbijagas’s  headquarters  today, it said.  Serbia is preparing for the South Stream pipeline that
should traverse its territory bringing gas from the Black Sea to
western  Europe . It plans to sign a new, 10-year contract in
March with OAO Gazprom for natural-gas imports that should more
than double deliveries to the Balkan nation to 5 billion cubic
meters a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
