Global oilseed stockpiles will drop
16 percent to a three-year low in the current 2011-12 crop year
as demand increases and dry weather in  South America  cuts
soybean production, Oil World said.  Inventories will fall to 74.1 million metric tons from 88.4
million tons in 2010-11, the Hamburg-based researcher said today
in a report. Consumption will rise 3.3 percent to 449.7 million
tons, it said. Global output faces a “major slowdown” in the
second half of 2011-12 after a La Nina weather system cut
soybean crops in Brazil and Argentina, Oil World said.  “The global production deficit of seven oilseeds will
become more severe than expected a month and two months ago,”
the researcher said. “Soybean crop losses have become
considerably greater in South America, primarily in southern
Brazil owing to drought.”  Soybeans have gained 8.3 percent this year on the Chicago
Board of Trade because of the dry weather in  Brazil , expected by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture to be the biggest exporter of
the oilseed this year. Rapeseed traded on ICE Futures  Canada  in
Winnipeg is up 8.9 percent.  Soybean production will fall 7.3 percent globally and
rapeseed output may drop 1.5 percent to a three-year low of 59.8
million tons, Oil World said. It predicted smaller rapeseed
crops in the European Union, the U.S., Ukraine, China and  India .  The decline for rapeseed will be limited by record harvests
in Canada, where growers will gather 14.4 million tons, and
 Australia , which will produce 3.05 million tons, according to
the researcher.  “Still, prices of rapeseed and oil have been trading at
premiums over competing commodities so far this season as a
result of insufficient supplies,” Oil World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
