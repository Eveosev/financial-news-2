Renaissance Services SAOG (RNSS)  rallied to
the highest close in almost five months on investor bets the
provider of services to the oil and gas industry may use money
raised from a planned issue of convertible bonds to fund growth.  Shares of the Muttrah, Oman-based company surged 4.3
percent to 0.632 Omani rial, the highest since Oct. 3, at the 1
p.m. close in Muscat. The benchmark  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  climbed 1.1
percent to 5,810.40, the highest since Aug. 2. Renaissance was
the fourth most-active stock by traded value on Oman’s measure
after its board recommended issuing zero-coupon convertible
bonds valued at 40 million rials ($104 million). The company
will seek shareholders’ approval on March 25.  “The capital raising will give the company a much more
liquid profile,” said Kanaga Sundar, head of research at Gulf
Baader Capital Markets SAOC in Muscat. “They may then go ahead
with a more planned strategy in terms of growth.”  Renaissance said this month  full-year revenue  increased 14
percent to 290 million rials, exceeding analysts’ estimates.
“In 2011, we addressed a series of one-off operational
challenges and we are now well-placed to move forward and
progress the company’s dynamic growth strategy,” Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Thomas said in a statement Feb. 15.  The company’s shares have rallied 16 percent so far this
year after a 51 percent drop in 2011. Renaissance said in
December it plans to raise as much as 50 million rials of
additional capital through a “quasi-equity instrument.”  Seven analysts  recommend investors buy shares of
Renaissance, while two have a hold rating on the stock. It’s
trading at 7.8 times estimated earnings, compared with 10 times
for the benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
