(Corrects growth forecasts in first paragraph.)  Namibia ’s economy will probably
expand 4.4 percent this year after growing 4.2 percent in 2011,
Finance Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said.  A slowdown in growth in neighboring  South Africa  and lower
mining output may curb growth this year, she said in a budget
speech today in Windhoek, the capital.  The southern African nation’s economy expanded 6.6 percent
in 2010, Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
