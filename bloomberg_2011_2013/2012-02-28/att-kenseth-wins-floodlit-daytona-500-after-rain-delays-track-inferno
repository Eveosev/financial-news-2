Matt Kenseth, the 2009 champion, won
the 54th Daytona 500, the season-opening Nascar race that was
delayed by rain and an inferno on the track.  The race got under way at a floodlit Daytona International
Speedway in  Daytona Beach ,  Florida , at 7 p.m. local time last
night after originally being postponed until noon yesterday when
rain wiped out the original Feb. 26 planned start.   With 40 laps remaining, the race was stopped for two hours,
five minutes, 29 seconds after a problem with Juan Pablo Montoyaâ€™s car sent it careening out of control into a track-
drying truck, causing its cargo of jet fuel to ignite and send a
fireball across the circuit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
