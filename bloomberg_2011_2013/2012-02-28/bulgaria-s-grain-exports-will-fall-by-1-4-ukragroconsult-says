Bulgaria’s grain exports will
probably decline by 1.4 percent to 3.6 million metric tons in
the marketing year starting July 1, according to agricultural
researcher UkrAgroConsult.  The forecast compares with 3.65 million tons of exports
expected in the current marketing year ending June 30, the Kiev-
based researcher said in an e-mailed statement today.  The grain harvest will probably climb to 7.11 million tons
this year from 6.99 million tons in 2011, with the wheat harvest
increasing to 4.2 million tons from 4.15 million tons last year,
UkrAgroConsult said.  Wheat exports in the marketing year from July 1 may drop to
1.9 million tons compared with a projected 2.1 million tons in
the current year through June, according to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
