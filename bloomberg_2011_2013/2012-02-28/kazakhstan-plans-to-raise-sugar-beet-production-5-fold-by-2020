Kazakhstan plans to raise its
production of sugar beets to an annual 960,000 metric tons from
200,000 metric tons by 2020 to help shrink the dependence on
imported sugar.  The increase will be achieved by increasing the land under
cultivation as well as making production more efficient, Ayna
Kusainova, a spokeswoman for the  Agriculture Ministry , said in
the capital Astana today. Kazakhstan currently depends on
imports for about 90 percent of its sugar, according to her.  To contact the reporter on this story:
