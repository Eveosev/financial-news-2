South Sudan  said it signed a peace
agreement with a prominent militia group whose leader was killed
by government troops in December.  The rebel group formerly headed by George Athor pledged to
disarm and join the national army, government spokesman Barnaba
Marial Benjamin told reporters today in the capital, Juba.  Athor’s group has been active in Jonglei state, which is
mostly covered by Block B, an unexploited oil concession owned
in part by the French company  Total SA. (FP)   The Geneva-based Small Arms Survey called Athor “the most
important of the dissidents” who took up arms against the
government after the end of a civil war that led to the south’s
separation from  Sudan  in July.  Athor formed the South Sudan Democratic Army in April 2010
after losing a bid for state governor. Benjamin said the
agreement includes promises of “political representation at a
state and national level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
