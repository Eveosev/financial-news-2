The Hungarian government is seeking
allies among European Union countries to help it prevent a
proposed suspension of EU development funds,  Vilaggazdasag  said,
citing unidentified diplomatic sources.  Hungary , which has 12 votes, needs 91 votes to block the
proposal at a March 13 vote of EU finance ministers, the
Budapest-based daily said.  The Czech Republic, which also has 12 votes, said earlier
it was opposed to the partial freeze of funds, according to the
paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
