Foreign  funds  withdrew  5.43 billion
rupees  ($111 million) of Indian equities yesterday, turning net
sellers of domestic stocks for the first time in 18 days, data
from the nation’s regulator show.  Foreigners bought 30.8 billion rupees of shares and sold
36.2 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. The outflow led to the benchmark BSE
India Sensitive Index falling 2.7 percent on Feb. 27, the most
in Asia and the fourth straight day of losses.  Offshore funds have bought a net 347.1 billion rupees of
equities this year, helping the Sensex to a 15 percent gain in
the period. They were net buyers for 17 straight days before
yesterday, the longest such stretch since October 2010, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Foreigners bought 25 billion rupees of bonds, taking total
inflow into debt this year to 235.2 billion rupees, data from
the regulator  show . They invested 421 billion rupees in bonds
last year. They have invested 4.791 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.443 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.3 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad rose
to a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among
the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led
the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the Sensex, the second worst annual
loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
