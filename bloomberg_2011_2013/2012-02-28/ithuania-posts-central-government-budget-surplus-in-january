Lithuania’s central-government
budget had a surplus in January, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The surplus, calculated on a cash basis, was 0.07 percent
of estimated gross domestic product in 2012, the Vilnius-based
 Finance Ministry  said today in a statement on its website. The
measure includes all public finances except municipal budgets.  Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’ government aims to narrow
the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP this year from an
estimated 5.3 percent in 2011.  Government debt fell to 35.6 percent of GDP at the end of
January from 39.4 percent at the end of 2011, the ministry said
in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
