U.S. stocks rose, sending the  Dow

companies from  Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (SWK)  to  Parker Hannifin (PH) 
Corp. the most attractive takeover targets, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘On The Prowl’  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s 81-year-old chairman and chief
executive officer said in his  annual letter  to shareholders on
Feb. 25 that he was “on the prowl” for large deals after
spending more than $35 billion on companies including Lubrizol
Corp. and Burlington Northern  Santa Fe  in the past two years.  With Berkshire generating  $1 billion  a month in free  cash
flow , the world’s most successful investor is eyeing takeovers
as near-zero percent interest rates limit returns in fixed-
income markets and the Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s cash
 hoard  increased to $37.3 billion.  Stanley Black & Decker, the world’s biggest maker of hand
tools, and  Parker Hannifin , which controls more than half the
market for fluid-powered valves, are among 21 U.S. companies
that meet the acquisition criteria in Berkshire’s annual report,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stanley Black & Decker and Parker Hannifin “seem very
plausible acquisition candidates for Buffett,” said  Timothy Ghriskey , who oversees $2 billion as chief investment officer of
Solaris Group in  Bedford Hills , New York. “We would expect him
to make a larger deal. He’s a man of his word.”
