(Corrects spelling of name in fourth paragraph.)  Indonesia ’s rupiah halted five days
of losses as signs of an improving U.S. economy outweighed
concern on government plans to reduce fuel subsidies. Bonds were
little changed.  Pending sales of existing homes rose 2 percent last month,
double the median forecast of 1 percent, according to the
National Association of Realtors in  Washington  yesterday.  Bank
Indonesia  had forecast on Feb. 20 the economy will grow 6.3
percent to 6.7 percent this year. Inflation may exceed the
central bank’s target of a maximum of 5.5 percent in 2012 if
fuel prices are raised by 1,000 ($0.11) per liter or more,
Governor Darmin Nasution said on Feb. 23.  “The rupiah is more driven by the global economy as a
whole at the moment,” said Gusti Kahari, a foreign exchange
dealer at PT Bank Artha Graha Internasional in Jakarta. “Higher
fuel prices will surely have an impact but it won’t be so severe
because Indonesia has very strong fundamentals.”  The rupiah traded at 9,160 per dollar as of 9:44 a.m. in
Jakarta, compared with 9,162 yesterday, according to prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 9,124
yesterday, the weakest level since Jan. 16.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  government bonds  was
little changed at 5.74 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Indonesia will decide whether to reduce fuel subsidies
after the government’s discussion with parliament to revise the
2012 state budget in March, Hatta Rajasa, coordinating minister
for the economy, said on Feb. 23. The government is proposing a
500 rupiah increase to 1,500 rupiah, said Jero Wacik, energy and
mineral minister.  To contact the reporters on this story:
