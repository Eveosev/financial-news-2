International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , the world’s largest computer-services provider, fired
more than 1,000 workers in  North America  this week, according to
an employee advocacy group.  The job reductions are mostly in the U.S., with some in
 Canada , said Lee Conrad, national coordinator of  Alliance@IBM ,
which has been trying to organize IBM employees. The group is
continuing to update the number as it receives severance
documents from workers notified with what IBM calls “resource
actions,” Conrad said. Redundant employees may apply for other
positions within IBM, the documents show.  Doug Shelton, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
declined to provide a number, citing company policy and the
“competitive nature of our business.”  The cuts would represent about 0.2 percent of IBM’s global
workforce, which totaled 433,362 at the end of 2011, according
to the annual report filed today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The company stopped providing a geographic
breakdown of its employees in 2009. At the end of 2008, U.S.
staff accounted for 115,000 of its 398,455 employees, according
to its annual report that year.  “IBM is constantly rebalancing its workforce,” Shelton
said today. “That means reducing in some areas and hiring in
others -- based on shifts in technology and client demand. This
allows IBM to remain competitive and relevant in an industry
that is constantly changing.”  IBM rose less than 1 percent to $197.98 at the close in  New
York . The shares have gained 7.7 percent this year.  Alliance@IBM is affiliated with the  Communications Workers
of America  and is seeking union recognition at IBM.  Information Week reported yesterday that more than 250 jobs
had been cut at IBM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
