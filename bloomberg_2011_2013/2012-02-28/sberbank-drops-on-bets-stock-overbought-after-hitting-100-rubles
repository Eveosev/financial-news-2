OAO Sberbank (SBER) ,  Russia ’s largest
lender, snapped two days of gains after topping 100 rubles
($3.45) a share for the first time in almost seven months.  Sberbank dropped 0.2 percent to 99.39 rubles after rising
as much as 0.7 percent to 100.40 rubles on the Micex Stock
Exchange in Moscow, the first time it traded above 100 rubles
since Aug. 4.  The stock’s 14-day relative strength index closed above 70
yesterday, the threshold that suggests to some traders that
equities are overbought. The central bank may sell some of its
controlling stake in Sberbank when the stock price moves
“closer to 100 rubles,” Bank Rossii First Deputy Chairman
 Alexei Ulyukayev  said in Davos in January.  The central bank, Sberbank’s biggest shareholder, is
seeking to raise as much as $7 billion, selling 7.58 percent of
the lender, Chief Financial Officer Anton Karamzin said in a May
25 interview. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and Troika Dialog were
chosen in June to manage the sale.  “The 100-ruble level is generally perceived as the minimum
level the government will accept,” Julian Rimmer, a trader of
Russian shares at CF Global Trading in  London , wrote in e-mailed
comments today. “To ensure that the placement goes off
comfortably they will need some discount and some margin for
error. Therefore a figure north of 110 roubles probably triggers
the deal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
