The yen’s 5.5 percent drop against
the dollar this month isn’t a prelude for further declines, said
Deutsche Bank AG’s head of foreign-exchange strategy.  “We don’t think this is the beginning of yen weakness,”  Bilal Hafeez  said in an interview with Linzie Janis on Bloomberg
Television’s “Countdown.” Deutsche Bank is the world’s biggest
foreign-exchange trader.  The yen tumbled after the  Bank of Japan (8301) , which has
struggled for more than a decade against deflation, said on Feb.
14 it would aim for 1 percent annual gains in consumer prices
and add 10 trillion yen ($124 billion) to the economy in asset
purchases. The Bank of England is also pursuing a bond-buying
plan known as quantitative easing.  “I don’t see the BOJ ramping up its QE over the course of
this year and trying to create inflation,” Singapore-based
Hafeez said. The yen weakness won’t be “sustained.”  The yen was little changed at 80.66 per dollar at 3:36 p.m.
