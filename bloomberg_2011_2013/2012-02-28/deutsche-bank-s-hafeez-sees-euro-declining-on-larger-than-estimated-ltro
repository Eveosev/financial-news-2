The euro may fall if the region’s
financial institutions get more cash than analysts estimate in
the  European Central Bank ’s tender for three-year loans, said
Deutsche Bank AG’s head of foreign-exchange strategy.  The central bank will allot cash from its longer-term
refinancing operation tomorrow. It probably will provide 470
billion euros ($631 billion) of funds, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of analysts.  “If we get a larger-than expected number then I think that
would weigh on the euro as it would reflect the fact that the
ECB’s balance sheet is expanding,” Bilal Hafeez  said in an
interview with Linzie Janis on Bloomberg Television’s
“Countdown.” Deutsche Bank is the world's biggest foreign-
exchange trader.  “If it’s smaller, at one level it should be positive for
the euro, it means the ECB’s balance sheet is expanding less,”
Singapore-based Hafeez said. “In the longer-term though, it may
be more negative for the European growth picture.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
