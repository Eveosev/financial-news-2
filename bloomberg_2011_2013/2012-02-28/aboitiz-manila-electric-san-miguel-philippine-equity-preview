Shares of the following companies

4,820.43, after losing 2.7 percent in the past three days.  Energy Development Corp. (EDC)  , the nation’s biggest
electricity producer using geothermal energy, increased 3.7
percent to 5.08 pesos. The gain, the sharpest since Sept. 28,
snapped a five-day, 14 percent slump. The stock’s 14-day
relative strength index, a gauge of how rapidly shares of risen

investors use as a signal to buy.  Manila Electric Co. (MER)  , the nation’s largest power
retailer, decreased 3.6 percent to 255.60 pesos, the steepest
loss since Nov. 29. The company’s core profit will reach 15
billion pesos this year, little changed from the 14.9 billion
pesos posted in 2011 because the utility failed to obtain an
increase in distribution rates from regulators, President  Manuel
Pangilinan  said.  Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (TEL)  , the
nation’s biggest company by market value, advanced 1.8 percent
to 2,850 pesos, the first gain in four days. Chairman Manuel
Pangilinan said PLDT, the nation’s biggest company by market
value, met its 2011 profit estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
