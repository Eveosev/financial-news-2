Germany stocks dropped, erasing an
earlier advance, after data showed orders for durable goods in
the U.S. dropped more than forecast, damping confidence in the
worldâ€™s largest economy.  The benchmark DAX Index lost 0.5 percent to 6,818.59 at
2:58 p.m. in  Frankfurt  after earlier climbing as much as 0.7
percent. The broader HDAX Index slid 0.4 percent.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
slumped 4 percent in January, the most in three years, led by a
slowdown in demand for comercial aircraft and business
equipment, data from the Commerce Department showed today. That
followed a revised 3.2 percent gain the prior month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
