Kenyan stocks increased for a sixth
straight day, advancing to a five month high, on foreign and
domestic buying ahead of the blue-chip banks’ full-year results.  The  Nairobi All Share Index (NSEASI)  gained 1 percent to 57.89 at
the close in Nairobi, the capital, on course for its highest
level since Sept. 28. The gauge has risen 6.4 percent this year.  “Kenya opened steady and feels good in the run up to
results from the blue chip banks,” Akinbamidele Akintola, an
analyst at  Renaissance Capital  in Lagos, said in an e-mailed
note to clients today. “Offshore money accounted for 50 percent
of the total buy side and the locals are also dipping their toes
in select names.”  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the country’s biggest lender by
outlets, climbed for a third day, increasing 1.3 percent to
20.25 shillings, the highest close since Aug. 23. The bank will
report annual results results March 1.  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC) , the Kenyan fuel retailer with operations
in nine African countries, increased for a third day, surging
2.7 percent to 11.55 shillings, the most in nearly seven months
ahead of its earnings announcement tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
