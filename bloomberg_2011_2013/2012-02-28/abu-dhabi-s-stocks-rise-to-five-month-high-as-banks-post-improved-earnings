Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark stock index
advanced to the highest level in more than five months after
banks in the emirate reported improved quarterly earnings,
boosting investor confidence. Dubai shares also rallied.  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , the United Arab Emirates lender that
reported better-than-expected profit last month, jumped 2.6
percent.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) , the U.A.E.’s third-
largest lender, surged to the highest since July. Abu Dhabi’s

and Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  soared 2.7 percent to 1,698.22,
the highest since December 2010.  The banking sector has shown “great potential, which is
the main trigger for economic recovery,” said Musa Haddad, head
trader at the  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) ’s asset-management
group. “We are seeing momentum building upwards on strong
volumes as well as new highs.”  Banks in the U.A.E., the second-largest Arab economy, are

financial crisis triggered a slump in real estate prices, slowed
tourism and investment banking revenue plunged. First Gulf,
