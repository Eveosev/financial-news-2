The shekel strengthened for the
first time in three days after the Bank of  Israel  kept interest
rates unchanged amid signs the  U.S. economy  is improving.  The shekel increased 0.2 percent to 3.7876 a dollar at
10:34 a.m. in Tel Aviv, trimming this month’s loss to 1.2
percent. The central bank left its  benchmark lending rate  at 2.5
percent late yesterday, saying U.S. economic data this month
“continue to be encouraging”.  The Bank of Israel had reduced the rate three times in the
past five months, including a 25 basis-point cut last month. The
decision to hold rates, which had been predicted by  all 24
economists  in a Bloomberg survey, kept the spread between
Israeli and U.S. rates steady. The  Federal Reserve  said in
January it may need to keep  interest rates  near zero through at
least late 2014.  “As a result of the central bank’s decision the rate
differential with the U.S. is not narrowing as in previous
months, which gives the shekel some support today,” said Eytan Admoni, head of the international department at Bank of
Jerusalem Ltd.  In the U.S., data showed applications for jobless benefits
applications stayed at the lowest level since 2008, consumer
confidence increased to a one-year high and purchases of new
homes exceeded economists’ forecasts. About 40 percent of
Israel’s gross domestic product is made up of exports, with the
U.S. and  Europe  the largest markets.  “Indicators of real economic activities are consistent
with the  Bank of Israel  forecast of growth of about 2.8 percent
in 2012,” the central bank said yesterday.  One-year interest rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for the benchmark rate in the period, were
unchanged at 2.45 percent. The yield on the benchmark 5.5
Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2022 fell one basis point to
4.64 percent.  The one-year breakeven rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bond and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, rose three basis points to 273, implying an
average annual inflation rate of about 2.73 percent. The  Tel
Aviv Bond 40 Index (TEL-B40) , which measures inflation-linked and fixed-
rate corporate bonds, gained 0.1 percent to 263.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
