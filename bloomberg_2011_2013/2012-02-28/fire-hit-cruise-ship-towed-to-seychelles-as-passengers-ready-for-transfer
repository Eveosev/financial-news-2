The government of the Seychelles is
making arrangements for passengers aboard the Costa Allegra, a
cruise ship owned by  Carnival Corp. (CCL) ’s Costa Crociere SpA, to be
evacuated to the island of Desroches and later transferred to
Mahe.  The ship is currently being towed toward Desroches by a
French fishing vessel, the Seychelles Coast Guard said on the
government’s website today. Two tug boats are being sent to the
Allegra by the Seychelles Ports Authority and they will reach
the Allegra “this afternoon,” the government said.  The tugs will tow the allegra to Port Victoria and will be
provided with an escort from the coast guard and the country’s
airforce, the government said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
