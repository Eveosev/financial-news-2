Sleepy’s Inc., the mattress
retailer, set the  interest rate  it will pay on a $170 million
term loan it’s seeking to refinance debt and fund a distribution
to shareholders, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The debt, due in seven years, will pay interest at 6
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. Libor, a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars
from each other, will have a 1.25 percent floor.  Sleepy’s is proposing to sell the loan at 98 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value to refinance the debt during the first year, the
person said.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing for the
Hicksville, New York-based company, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a  term loan , it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
