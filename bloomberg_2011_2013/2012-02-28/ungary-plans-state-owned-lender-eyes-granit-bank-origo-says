(Corrects ownership of Takarekbank in first paragraph.)  Hungary is planning to set up a
state-owned commercial bank and is contemplating buying a stake
in commercial lenders Granit Bank Zrt., owned by real-estate
developer Sandor Demjan, and Takarekbank Zrt., news website
Origo said, citing several unidentified people.  Due diligence has started both at Granit Bank, in which
Demjan has close to 90 percent, and at Takarekbank, which is
minority-owned by  Germany â€™s  DZ Bank (DZBK) , according to Origo.  The government is seeking to boost state ownership in the
banking industry, carve out a market share as foreign-owned
lenders retract, and boost lending, which froze during the
economic crisis, Origo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
