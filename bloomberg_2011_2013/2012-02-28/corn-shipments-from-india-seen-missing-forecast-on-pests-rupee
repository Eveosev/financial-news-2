India ,  Asia ’s biggest corn exporter,
may ship less grain than predicted this year after pests spurred
 Vietnam  to reject some cargoes and as the strengthening rupee
boosted prices, according to a traders’ group.  Sales in the year that began on Oct. 1 will trail the 3
million metric tons estimated in November, said Pravin Dongre,
president of the India Pulses & Grains Association. The country
exported 2.5 million tons in 2010-2011, he said in a phone
interview in Mumbai.  Futures lost 10 percent in the past year in Chicago as
record global corn production cut demand for the livestock-feed
ingredient from the U.S., the largest producer and exporter.
Vietnam may boost imports from  South America  and Ukraine after
turning back a couple of Indian cargoes, citing the presence of
live khapra beetles, an insect that destroys grain, Dongre said.  “Earlier if there were 10 buyers, then 10 shippers were
willing to export to Vietnam,” said Dongre. “With this issue,
shippers are very hesitant.”  Vietnam is the third-largest buyer of Indian corn after
Indonesia and  Malaysia , he said. The country may halt imports if
India persists in sending infected cargoes, said Nguyen Xuan
Hong, head of the plant protection department at the Ministry of
Agriculture and  Rural Development .  “We didn’t let some cargoes with khapra beetles go through
recently,” he said by phone. “If India continues to violate,
not carefully disinfecting before exporting to our country,
we’ll propose banning imports,” he said. More than half of the
country’s imports come from India, he said.  Rupee Rally  A rebound in the Indian currency from a record low against
the dollar in December has increased export prices, making
supplies from Argentina and Ukraine cheaper, said Dongre.  Futures on the National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange
Ltd. in Mumbai rose 15 percent since Oct. 1, beating the 11
percent gain in  Chicago . The rupee, which fell to a record
54.305 to the dollar on Dec. 15, rallied 7.9 percent this year.  “The rupee was appreciating in a big way so we were
becoming uncompetitive,” said Dongre. “Buyers prefer Argentine
corn to Indian corn, unless and until there is a huge disparity
in price. Ukraine is also feeding the market.”  Corn for May delivery gained 0.3 percent to $6.59 a bushel
in Chicago by 8:42 p.m. in  Singapore , while the contract for
March delivery was little changed at 1,153 rupees ($24) per 100
kilograms in Mumbai today.  Record Harvest  World corn production  will total a record 863.8 million
tons in 2011-2012, the International Grains Council said Feb. 23.
The U.S. harvest may jump 15 percent to an all-time high 14.27
billion bushels as surging profits spur farmers to plant the
most acres since World War II, the government said Feb. 24.  Ukraine’s exports may jump 20 percent to 15 million tons in
2012-2013 because of a bumper harvest, Andrew Druzyaka, adviser
at the State Food & Grain Corp. of Ukraine, said Feb. 23.  India probably shipped 1.1 million tons to 1.2 million of
corn since Oct. 1, said Dongre. The country may produce 21.6
million tons in 2011-2012, compared with 21.7 million tons a
year earlier, according to the farm ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
