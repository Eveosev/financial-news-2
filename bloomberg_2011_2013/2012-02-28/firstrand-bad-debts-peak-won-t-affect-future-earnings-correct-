(Corrects to say decrease in second paragraph.)  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  said bad debts on the
South African lender’s books had peaked and wouldn’t affect
future earnings.  The bank loses 360 million rand for every 50 basis-point
decrease in  interest rates , Chief Operating Officer Johan Burger
told a results presentation in Johannesburg today.  The Johannesburg-based financial services company has
enough capital to withstand the impact of the Basel III rules on
capital adequacy, Burger said.  Group return on equity may rise and FirstRand is targeting
18 percent to 22 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
