(Corrects headline and first paragraph to say
“challenging” instead of “challenged.”)  Airbus SAS’s wide-body A350
aircraft, which the manufacturer has said will enter  service  in
the first half of 2014, is “challenging” technically and from
its proposed timescale, supplier  GKN Plc (GKN)  said.  GKN is working “incredibly hard” and has delivered the
first set of composite wing spars for the aircraft, GKN Chief
Executive Officer Nigel Stein said on a conference call today,
declining to predict when the plane would enter service.  “Where it goes from there is a matter for them,” he said.  GKN gets $2.5 million in revenue from each A350 for which
it supplies parts, and about $2.6 million for each  Boeing Co. (BA) 
787, the Redditch, England-based company said in an earnings
statement today.  GKN sent Boeing 25 so-called shipsets for the 787 last year
and predicts it will send “slightly  more” than that in 2012,
Stein said. A shipset is a set of parts toward constructing a
plane. Stein declined to make further projections for production
rates this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
