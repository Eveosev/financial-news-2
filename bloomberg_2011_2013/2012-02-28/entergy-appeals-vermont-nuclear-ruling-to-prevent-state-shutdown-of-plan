Entergy Corp. (ETR) , the nuclear-plant
operator that won a federal court ruling last month preventing
the state from shutting down its  Vermont  Yankee reactor,
appealed that decision to prevent the state from further
attempts to close it.  Entergy appealed to the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in New York
late yesterday, 10 days after Vermont’s attorney general
appealed U.S. District Judge Garvan Murtha’s decision in
Brattleboro, Vermont, that the state lacked the authority to
deny Entergy a license to operate the state’s only nuclear
reactor after March 21.  The company, in a separate filing yesterday, sought an
injunction that would block the state from taking any new
actions to shut down the plant pending the appeal.  Vermont’s Public Service Board, in a memo dated Feb. 22,
said that the state still has the right to deny a license
because of the amount of spent nuclear fuel that is stored at
the reactor, Entergy said in its filing. Entergy seeks to have
Murtha’s ruling amended because it didn’t take into account this
matter.  The case is Entergy v. Shumlin, 11-00099, U.S. District
Court, District of Vermont (Brattleboro).  To contact the reporter on this story:
