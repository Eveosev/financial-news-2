Canadian natural gas fell as above-
normal temperatures in the U.S. pared furnace use.  Alberta  gas dropped 2.6 percent. Demand for heat across the
U.S. will trail normal by 17 percent through March 6, according
to Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather Derivatives.  New
York ’s low March 2 may be 44 degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius), 12
above normal, AccuWeather Inc. said.  “The weather outlook continues to show bearish trends,”
said Eric Bickel, a natural gas analyst with Summit Energy
Services in Louisville,  Kentucky . “There’s an expectation that
it’s going to persist.”  Alberta gas for March delivery declined 4.75 cents to

TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
