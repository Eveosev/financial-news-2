Montreal  Canadiens Hall of Fame
center Jean Beliveau is hospitalized after a stroke, the
National Hockey League team said.  Beliveau, 80, is undergoing tests and observation, the team
said in a statement on its  website . Beliveau was stricken
yesterday. He underwent surgery in June to repair abdominal
aneurysms, according to the team.  Beliveau played parts of 20 seasons with Montreal, winning
the Stanley Cup 10 times as a player and seven more as an
executive with the team. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of
Fame in 1972 after the hall waived its customary three-year
waiting period.  A 14-time All-Star, Beliveau was the Canadiens’ captain
from 1961 until his retirement in 1971. He ranks second in club
history behind Guy Lafleur with 1,219 points and 712 assists.
His 507 goals are third behind Lefleur and Maurice Richard.  After joining the Canadiens in 1953, Beliveau went on to
win the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL’s scoring champion in 1956
and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league’s most valuable
player in 1956 and 1964. In 1965, he became the first player to
win the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the playoffs after leading
the Canadiens to a win over the Chicago Black Hawks in the
 Stanley Cup  final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
