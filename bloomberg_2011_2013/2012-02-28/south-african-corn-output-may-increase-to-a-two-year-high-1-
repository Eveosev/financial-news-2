South Africa  may reap 13 percent
more corn this season, the biggest harvest since 2009-10 as
farmers plant larger areas with the grain, according to the Crop
Estimates Committee website.  Farmers may harvest 11.7 million metric tons, including 6.8
million tons of white corn and 4.9 million tons of yellow, Marda
Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the committee, said by phone from
 Pretoria  today. The forecast exceeds the 11.4 million-ton
average estimate of seven traders polled by Bloomberg News.  More land was planted with corn in the Northern Cape, Free
State, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, North West and KwaZulu-Natal
provinces boosting output, Scheepers said. The nation produced
10.36 million tons last year.  White-corn prices have risen 26 percent over the past year
on the South African Futures Exchange. The grain for July
delivery closed at 2,035 rand ($270) a ton today. Yellow corn
for July delivery closed at 2,000 rand a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
