Petroleos Mexicanos ,  Latin America ’s
largest oil producer, posted a loss for the second consecutive
quarter as higher taxes and stagnant output offset higher oil
prices.  Pemex’s loss in the fourth quarter widened slightly to 23.8
billion pesos ($1.8 billion) from 23.6 billion pesos in the
year-earlier period, the  Mexico  City-based company said
yesterday in a filing to the Mexican stock exchange.  While Pemex tax payments rose 44 percent to 243.5 billion
pesos, the Mexican export crude mix price climbed 34 percent to
average $104.31 a barrel in the three months ended on Dec. 31.
That’s 13 cents below its highest quarterly average reached in
the second quarter of 2008. Crude output from the state-owned
company fell 1 percent to 2.55 million barrels a day, the lowest
level since 1990.  Quarterly revenue rose 23 percent to 420 billion pesos.  Pemex said total debt as of Dec. 31 increased to 783
billion pesos. Pemex refining had a negative margin of $2.64 per
processed barrel amid  oil prices  volatility, the company said.  Pemex is increasing refinery investments by 24 percent to
40 billion pesos this year to improve efficiencies and avoid
unscheduled stoppages,  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel , chief executive
officer of the Mexico City-based company, said in a Dec. 2
presentation.  Falling domestic gasoline production prompted Mexico to
boost fuel imports to 678,212 barrels a day last year, the
highest since 1990, the earliest data available on the Energy
Ministry’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
