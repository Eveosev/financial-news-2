Japan  said its  imports  of Iranian
crude fell in January to an average of 1.7 million kiloliters,
or 344,532 barrels a day, down 12 percent from a earlier.  Imports were up 8.5 percent from 1.6 million kiloleters, or
317,452.08 barrels a day, in December, according to data from
the Ministry of Finance. January’s year-to-year decrease in
imports from Iran was greater than the 2.1 percent decline in
Japan’s total crude imports.  Japan, the world’s second-biggest buyer of Iran’s crude
after  China , is seeking an exemption to a U.S. law that would
punish banks that do business with Iran.  The law, aimed at reducing Iran’s oil sales, will sanction
any country’s financial institutions that do business with
 Iran ’s central bank unless it is determined that country has
made “significant reductions” in Iranian oil imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
