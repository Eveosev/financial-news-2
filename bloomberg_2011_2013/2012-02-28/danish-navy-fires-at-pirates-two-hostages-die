Two hostages died as a Danish
warship patrolling the  Gulf of Aden  under NATO command opened
fire on a pirate vessel.  There were 17 pirates and 18 hostages on board the ship,
the navy said in a  statement  today, without disclosing
nationalities. The two hostages died after sustaining
unspecified injuries when navy personnel boarded the ship
yesterday. A navy doctor at the scene was unable to save them,
according to the statement.  There are about 3,500 Somali pirates attacking vessels in
the Gulf of Aden and the  Indian Ocean , the  United Nations  said
on Feb 16. Attacks rose to a record 237 last year, with ransoms
of $160 million paid to release 31 hijacked vessels, according
to a One Earth Future Foundation report released this month.  “The conditions that led to the death of the two hostages
aren’t yet known,” the navy said in the statement. “The Danish
Military Judge Advocate is now investigating the
circumstances.”  The navy said its ship, the Absalon, had been tracking the
pirate vessel for several days near the Somali coast. As the
pirate ship tried to leave the coast, the warship called on it
to stop, firing warning shots. When the pirate ship didn’t
respond, the Danish warship opened fire, according to the
statement. The vessel had been used as a base by the pirates for
attacks in the region, the navy said.  Piracy cost the shipping industry and governments $6.9
billion last year, including $2.7 billion in extra fuel to speed
up through the area and $1.27 billion on military operations,
according to the One Earth Future Foundation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
