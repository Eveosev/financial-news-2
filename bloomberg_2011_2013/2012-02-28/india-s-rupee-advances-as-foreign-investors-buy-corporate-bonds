India ’s rupee strengthened after
overseas funds stepped up purchases of local-currency company
bonds to meet a quota deadline.  The Securities & Exchange Board of India auctioned $5
billion of corporate debt-purchase quotas on Nov. 30 to
foreigners, who must use the allocations by the end of today or
let them expire. Foreign investors added $898 million to
 holdings  of Indian debt last week, exchange data show, following
net sales of $275 million in the previous period.  “Inflows are supporting the rupee as today is the deadline
for the transactions,” said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at
state-owned  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai. “We will also see month-end
demand for dollars from importers.”  The rupee advanced 0.1 percent to 49.1873 per dollar as of
9:58 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has strengthened almost 8 percent this year.  Three-month offshore non-deliverable forward contracts
traded at 50.22 a dollar, compared with 50.36 yesterday.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
