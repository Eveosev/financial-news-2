Indian stocks climbed for the first
time in five days as  oil prices  dropped, easing concerns rising
energy costs will undermine efforts to curb inflation and lower
 interest rates .  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the world’s largest
oil-refining complex, added 1.9 percent.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the
largest truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover, rose for the
first time in eight days.  State Bank of India , the country’s
biggest lender, gained the most in a month.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, advanced 1.6
percent to 17,731.12 at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, ending a four-day,
5.3 percent decline. Oil dropped for a second day today, losing
as much as 0.6 percent to $107.84 a barrel, potentially cutting
costs for companies in India, which imports three-quarters of
its oil.  Foreigner investors  have poured $7 billion in local
stocks this year, according to the  market regulator .  “A high oil price would be a negative for  India  in the
long term, but as long as it doesn’t exceed $130, it shouldn’t
have too significant an impact on the  budget deficit  and
inflation numbers,” Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of multi-
asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd., which oversees
$46 billion, said by phone today.  The RBI has signaled cuts in borrowing costs to shield the
economy if inflation eases further. The interest-rate cycle has
peaked,  RBI (RBI)  Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said on Feb. 14, after
data showed consumer-price growth eased to a more than two-year
low in January. The bank’s next policy review is on March 15.  ‘Ill Afford’  “For every $10 increase in crude oil price, if it does get
passed on to the consumer, one is talking about an 80 basis
points increase in inflation,” Jal Irani, managing director at
Macquarie Capital Securities (India) Pvt., said in an interview
with Bloomberg UTV today. “The increase, if not passed, raises
India’s subsidy bill by $7 billion to $8 billion a year. Given
the significant deficit the government is running, higher oil
price is something that one can ill afford.”  Demand for oil may weaken after London-traded Brent rose to
a record high when priced in euros and pounds, according to
Morgan Stanley. Brent, the benchmark for more than half the
world’s crude, is also approaching a record in Indian rupees.  The Sensex has advanced 15 percent this year as overseas
funds poured money into Indian shares after inflation slowed and
the rupee rallied from a record low even as company profit
growth slowed. The measure trades at 15.7 times future  profits ,
compared with 19.4 times at end of 2010. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index trades at 10.7 times.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. gained 1.8 percent to 5,375.50. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200) 
soared 2.2 percent to 2,183.73.  BP Plan  Reliance climbed 1.9 percent to 796.5 rupees, snapping a
two-day 6.9 percent fall.  BP Plc (BP/)  said it’s developing a new plan
with partner Reliance, operator of the country’s biggest natural
gas deposit, to develop discoveries in the area simultaneously
instead of in phases.  Tata Motors, the maker of the world’s cheapest car, the
Nano, jumped 5.2 percent to 273.35 rupees, extending this year’s
rally to 53 percent.  State Bank  rallied 5.1 percent to 2,231.25
rupees.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-biggest lender, rose 2.6
percent to 910.8 rupees.  Profit growth of companies in the Sensex index fell to 4.3
percent in the final three months of 2011, trailing analysts’
estimates. The government predicted Feb. 7 that economic growth
in the year ending March will probably slow to 6.9 percent, the
weakest pace since 2009, from 8.4 percent a year earlier.  Overseas  investors  sold a net  5.43 billion rupees  of Indian
equities yesterday, paring their investments in equities this
year to 347.1 billion rupees, according to the nation’s market
regulator. That would be first net sales this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
