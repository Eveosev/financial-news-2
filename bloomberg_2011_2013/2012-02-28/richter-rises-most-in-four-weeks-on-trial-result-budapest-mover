Gedeon Richter Nyrt. (RICHT) ,  Hungary ’s
biggest drugmaker, rose the most in almost four weeks after its
experimental antipsychotic drug cariprazine met the main goals
of two late-stage studies in schizophrenia.  The shares gained as much as 4.9 percent and traded 2.9
percent higher at 39,105 forint by the close in Budapest, the
biggest jump since since Feb. 2. The benchmark BUX stock  index 
advanced 0.3 percent to 19,217.87.  Richter and its partner  Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX)  plan to
seek approval for the drug this year to treat schizophrenia and
bipolar mania, they said in a statement today. Budapest-based
Richter and Forest previously reported successful late-stage
trials in bipolar mania, they said.  “This is a development of great importance and the news
should have a very positive impact on the stock price today,”
