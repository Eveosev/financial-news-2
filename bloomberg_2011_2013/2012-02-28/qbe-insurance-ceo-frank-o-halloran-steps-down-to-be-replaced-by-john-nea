Frank O’Halloran will step down as
chief executive officer of  QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE)  after his
13-year strategy of expanding through acquisitions faltered as a
run of global catastrophes increased compensation payouts.  O’Halloran, 65, will be replaced by QBE’s global head of
underwriting John Neal on Aug. 17, the Sydney-based company said
in a statement today. QBE shares have been halted from trading
after the company announced plans to replace $500 million of
debt by selling stock. Net income fell 45 percent to $704
million in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, it said, citing “one of
the worst years on record for catastrophe events.”  The 35-year QBE veteran oversaw a tenfold increase in
premiums and 44 acquisitions valued at $7.61 billion since
becoming CEO in January 1998, according to  data compiled  by
Bloomberg. The shares have plunged 67 percent since their peak
in September 2007.  “I wouldn’t read this as the end of their successful
growth-by-acquisitions strategy,” said Mark Nathan, who helps
manage about A$3 billion ($3.2 billion) of assets at Arnhem
Investment Management in Sydney. “Neal will probably hit the
ground running. He knows the business and has been there for
some time, so I wouldn’t have thought there would be any sort of
slowdown.”  The company today said claims for catastrophes jumped 15.3
percent to $2.4 billion in 2011, including floods in  Thailand ,
19 U.S. tornadoes, earthquakes in  New Zealand  and  Japan , as well
as Cyclone Yasi in  Australia ’s Queensland state.  QBE tumbled the most in more than 10 years on Jan. 12 after
it said 2011 profit fell as much as 50 percent on record natural
disaster claims.  Shares Halted  Shares of QBE fell 1 percent to A$11.50 in Sydney
yesterday, extending this year’s slide to 11 percent. The
benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  has gained 5.6 percent in that time.  Trading in the shares was halted today until QBE undertakes
a capital raising to replace $500 million of its tier 2
convertible debt, the company said in a separate statement. QBE
plans to sell A$450 million in shares to institutional investors
and a share purchase plan for retail investors, it said.  Morgan Stanley and Macquarie Group Ltd. are managing the
sale of the shares to investors with a minimum bid price of
$10.50 a piece, according to terms of the transaction obtained
by Bloomberg News. That’s an 8.7 percent discount to the most
recent closing price.  Global Expansion  The cost of credit-default swaps on QBE fell 25 basis
points to 300 as of 11:18 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. That’s on course for the biggest daily decline
since Dec. 13, and the lowest level since Oct. 31, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  After expanding under O’Halloran into offshore markets such
as  North America , the company founded in 1886 in north
Queensland as a one-man business now has operations in 52
countries and more than 16,000 employees. The company switched
to reporting in U.S. dollars in 2010, a year in which more than
70 percent of its premiums were generated in currencies other
than the Australian dollar.  Neal, 47, will join the QBE board, and O’Halloran will
return as a non-executive director “shortly before the 2013
annual general meeting,” the company said today.  “Frank has been the architect of QBE’s international
expansion,” said Chairman Belinda Hutchinson in today’s
statement. “We believe his continued involvement on the board
will be welcomed by investors.”  Neal, who has headed QBE’s global underwriting operations
since January 2011, joined the company in 2004 after it bought
Ensign, a commercial motor insurer, according to the statement.
He has held senior roles at QBE in  Europe , including chief
operating officer for the wholesale, retail and reinsurance
business, and chief underwriting officer for the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
