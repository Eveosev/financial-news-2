A decision to award $23.9 million in
compound interest to  McKesson Corp. (MCK)  in a 30-year dispute over a
dairy seized by the Iranian government during the country’s 1979
revolution was reversed by an appeals court.  U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in  Washington  ruled in
November 2010 that Iran violated its own laws and international
laws when it took control of Pak Dairy Co. and withheld
dividends from San Francisco-based McKesson.  Leon awarded McKesson about $44 million, including
$23.9 million in compound interest. An appeals court in
Washington today reversed the decision to grant compound
interest and sent the decision back to the lower court to
recalculate the award.  “In light of the utter lack of evidence indicating that
compound interest is a recognized remedy under Iranian law, we
reverse that portion of the award,” the appeals court said.
“However, because  Iran  does not challenge the award of simple
interest in this case, we remand for calculation of an award
consisting of the value of McKesson’s expropriated interest in
Pak and its withheld dividends plus simple interest.”  The parties have been fighting since at least 1982 over the
dairy, which, according to court records was created in 1960 by
McKesson and a group of Iranian investors. The case has been the
subject of several appeals over jurisdiction.  The case is McKesson Corp. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 82-
cv-00220, U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia 
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
