McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
largest restaurant chain, is considering selling dim sum bonds
again in Hong Kong as one option for raising funds to expand in
the world’s second-largest economy.  “At this stage, we are going through various options we
have right now,”  Kenneth Chan , McDonald’s  China  chief executive
officer, said in an interview in Shanghai today. “We are able
to fund our growth in China regardless.”  Dim sum bonds “is one of the options for sure,” he said.  Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s said last month it
plans to increase investment in China, its third-largest market,
by 50 percent this year after opening a record 200 stores in
2011. Chan today reiterated that the fast-food chain’s focus
will be on opening 225 to 250 outlets this year. He didn’t
provide a specific figure for its investment target.  McDonald’s sold 200 million yuan of 3 percent notes in  Hong
Kong  in 2010, becoming the first foreign non-financial company
to offer yuan-denominated bonds. The bonds are due in September
2013.  London- and Rotterdam-based Unilever became the first
European consumer company to sell so-called dim sum bonds last
year to fund its businesses in China.  McDonald’s lags  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) ’s KFC Corp. in China,
where KFC’s more than 3,200 outlets outstrip McDonald’s 1,400.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
