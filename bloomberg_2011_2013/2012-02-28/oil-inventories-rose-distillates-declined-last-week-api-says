Oil supplies rose 521,000 barrels

said.  Distillate fuel inventories  fell 3.31 million barrels to
140.1 million, the APIâ€™s weekly report showed.  Gasoline
stockpiles (APISMGAS)  dropped 916,000 barrels to 230.7 million.  Crude at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rose 1.64 million
barrels to 33.8 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  The government report may show supplies of oil rose 1.1
million barrels last week, according to the median of 12
responses in a  Bloomberg News (DOEASCRD)  survey of analysts. Gasoline
inventories probably fell 425,000 barrels, the survey showed.
Distillates were expected to slip by 750,000 barrels.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for April delivery fell $2.08, or 1.9 percent, to
$106.48 at 4:33 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New York
