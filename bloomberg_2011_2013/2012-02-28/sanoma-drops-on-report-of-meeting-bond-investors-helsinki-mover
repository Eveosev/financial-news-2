Sanoma Oyj (SAA1V) , a Finnish publishing and
broadcasting company, fell to a six-week low in Helsinki trading
following a report the company plans to meet bond investors.  Sanoma fell as much as 2.6 percent, the most on the OMX
Helsinki 25 index. The stock fell 25 cents, or 2.5 percent, to
9.75 euros as of 2:41 p.m. Sanoma, based in the Finnish capital,
has lost 34 percent of its value in the last 12 months, compared
with an 14 percent decline for the OMX Helsinki 25 index.  Sanoma will hold meetings with bond investors in  Europe 
starting March 5, two people with knowledge of the arrangements
said. Sanoma added debt when it bought stakes in Dutch and
Belgian broadcasting and print assets from Unterfoehring,
Germany-based  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM)  last year. The company
aims to replace a maturing 250 million-euro ($336 million)
bridge-to-bond facility with a  bond issue  this year, Chief
Financial Officer Kim Ignatius said Feb. 7.  BNP Paribas SA, ING Groep NV and Nordea Markets are
arranging the bond presentations, the people said.  The company cut its dividend proposal to 0.60 euros a
share, compared with 1.1 euros a year earlier, and forecast Feb.
