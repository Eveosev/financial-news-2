Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s copyright-
infringement lawsuit against SAP AG, the biggest maker of
business-management software, is set to go to trial for a second
time on June 18.  U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland,
 California , scheduled the retrial today after Oracle decided
this month to pursue a new trial rather than accept her
$1 billion reduction in a jury verdict the company won in 2010.  Oracle, based in Redwood City, California,  sued  in 2007
after discovering that SAP’s software-maintenance unit had
downloaded and copied its software. SAP, based in Walldorf,
Germany, didn’t contest that it was liable for the infringement
by its TomorrowNow unit, which the company closed in 2008.  Jurors awarded Oracle $1.3 billion, based on the value of a
hypothetical license that SAP would have needed to use Oracle’s
software. Hamilton threw out the verdict, calling it “grossly
excessive” and not supported by the evidence, and said Oracle
could accept her decision to reduce the amount to $272 million
or get a new trial.  TomorrowNow pleaded guilty in September to U.S. charges of
unauthorized computer access and SAP paid the unit’s
$20 million fine.  The civil case is Oracle Corp. v.  SAP AG (SAP) , 07-1658, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
