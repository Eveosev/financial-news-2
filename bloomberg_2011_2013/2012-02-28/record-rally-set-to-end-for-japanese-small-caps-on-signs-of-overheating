A measure of  Japan ’s smaller stocks
ended its record winning streak amid speculation shares were
overbought after a 30-day streak of advances that came as
spending on disaster reconstruction boosted earnings.  Japan’s  TSE Second Section Price Index (TSE2) , a measure of
smaller companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dropped 0.1
percent to 2,379.16 at the 3 p.m. close of trading today in
Tokyo. The gauge advanced 12 percent during a 30-day stretch of
gains through yesterday, the longest series of increases ever,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1961.  The 14-day relative strength index for the measure was 95
today, above the 70 threshold that suggests to some traders that
equities have been overbought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
