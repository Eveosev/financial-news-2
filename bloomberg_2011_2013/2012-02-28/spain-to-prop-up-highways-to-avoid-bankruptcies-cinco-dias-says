Spain ’s Development Ministry has
responded favorably to banks’ request for aid to prevent highway
operators going bankrupt,  Cinco Dias  reported without citing
sources.  The government is considering a plan to compensate highway
operators’ falling income as traffic is lower than forecast,
Cinco Dias said. The aid would enable the companies repay banks
around 3 billion euros ($4 billion) in loans, Cinco Dias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
