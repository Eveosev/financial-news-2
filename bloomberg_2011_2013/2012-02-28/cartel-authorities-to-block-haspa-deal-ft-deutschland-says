Plans by  Hamburger Sparkasse  to buy
a 25.1 percent stake in Kreissparkasse Herzogtum Lauenburg will
be blocked this week by  Germany â€™s cartel authorities,  Financial
Times Deutschland  said, citing a person familiar with the
matter.  The cartel office will block the transaction on fears the
bank may dominate the market in some areas after the
transaction, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
