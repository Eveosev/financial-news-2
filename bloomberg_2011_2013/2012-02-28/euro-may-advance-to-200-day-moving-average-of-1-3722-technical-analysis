The euro may rise toward its 200-day
moving average of $1.3722, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
said, citing trading patterns.  Lines tracking the 17-nation currency’s 5- and 21-day
moving averages versus the dollar are both pointing up,
signaling a bullish trend for the euro in the long term,
according to Teppei Ino, an analyst in  Tokyo  at the unit of
 Japan ’s largest financial group. The last time the euro traded
at $1.3722 was on Nov. 14.  The euro may first fall toward the 90-day moving average of
$1.3243 if it’s unable to rise above $1.3509, the 38.2 percent
retracement of the common currency’s slide from the May 4 high
of $1.4940 to the Jan. 13 low of $1.2624, Ino said, citing the
Fibonacci chart. The euro may be poised for a downward
correction in the short term because the recent appreciation has
been “rapid,” he said.  “If the euro is unable to rise above the $1.35 level in
the near term, it’s likely to test lower because its
appreciation has been rapid,” Ino said.  The euro traded at $1.3460 as of 8:25 a.m. in Tokyo, from
$1.3458 yesterday in  New York . The euro’s low on Jan. 13 was the
weakest level since August 2010. It climbed to as high as
$1.3487 on Feb. 24, the strongest since Dec. 5.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices tend
to drop or rise by certain percentages after reaching a high or
low. In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
