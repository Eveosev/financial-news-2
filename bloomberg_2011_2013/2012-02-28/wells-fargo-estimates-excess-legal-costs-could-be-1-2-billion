Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S.
home lender, boosted its estimate for the possible additional
cost of buying back soured mortgages to as much as $2.1 billion.  The year-end estimate, contained in the San Francisco-based
company’s  annual report  released today, was an increase from
$1.9 billion in the third quarter. It represents the lender’s
estimate of costs beyond what’s already in reserve and reflects
what’s reasonably possible, rather than what’s probable,
according to the document.  Investors who buy loans are entitled to ask for refunds or
compensation if they find missing or inaccurate data on home
values or the borrower’s income. Since the start of 2007, faulty
lending and foreclosures have cost the five biggest U.S. home
lenders more than $72 billion, with at least $5.98 billion
attributed to Wells Fargo, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Wells Fargo shares rose 29 cents to $31.32 at 3:02 p.m. in
 New York , leaving them with a gain of 14 percent for 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
