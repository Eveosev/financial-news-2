Elementis Plc (ELM) , the world’s largest
maker of hectorite-clay additives used in cosmetics, plans to
increase investment and pump $15 million into U.S. expansion
over the next two years, Finance Director Brian Taylorson said.  Capital expenditure will rise to $20 million to $25 million
in 2012, from $14 million last year, Taylorson said. Elementis,
which reported record profit today, is budgeting for a similar
level of investment in 2013, he said.  The maker of paint and chromium, based in London, is in the
early stages of a new expansion program in the U.S. to capture
market share for additives used in water-based paints, Taylorson
said in a phone interview today. Elementis is focusing on
higher-margin chemicals used in lubricants and coatings in
industries spanning oil-drilling and aerospace, while running
its chromium business for cash.  “Our priority is to see if we can reinvest excess cash,”
Taylorson said.  Elementis shares declined 1.3 percent to 163.7 pence in
 London  as of 8:52 a.m.  Pretax profit before one-time items gained 40 percent to
$134.5 million, the company reported today. Revenue climbed 9
percent to $760.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
