The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
bought the building at 33 Maiden Lane for $207.5 million from
Merit US Real Estate Fund III, LP, according to a statement on
the district bank’s website.  “The purchase is a cost-effective way to meet our business
needs and will enable us to more easily ensure appropriate
security for our operations,” William C. Dudley, president of
the  New York  Fed, said today in the statement.  The New York Fed previously leased space in the building
and was its primary occupant since 1998, the district bank said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
