Energy Development Corp. (EDC)  gained in
Manila stock trading, rebounding from a five-day slump that
drove the stock yesterday to the lowest since September 2010.  Shares of the geothermal energy producer advanced 3.1
percent to 5.05 pesos as of 10:37 a.m. local time, heading for
the sharpest gain since Sept. 28. The stockâ€™s 14-day relative
strength index sank to 14 yesterday, the lowest since September
2008 and below the 30 level that some investors use as a signal
to buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
