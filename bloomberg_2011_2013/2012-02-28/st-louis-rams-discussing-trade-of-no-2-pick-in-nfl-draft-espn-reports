The  St. Louis Rams  will trade the No.
2 pick in this year’s National Football League draft,  ESPN
reported , giving another team the chance to select Andrew Luck
or Robert Griffin III.  Luck, from Stanford University, and Griffin, the Heisman
Trophy winner from Baylor University, are the top two
quarterbacks available in the April 26 draft. The Indianapolis
Colts hold the No. 1 selection and have said they’ll use it to
draft the successor to quarterback Peyton Manning.  The Rams, who took quarterback Sam Bradford with the first
overall pick in 2010, have had trade discussions with the
Cleveland Browns, Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins, ESPN
said, citing unidentified league sources. The Browns currently
have the No. 4 pick, while the Redskins are at No. 6 and the
Dolphins have the eighth selection.  St. Louis  is seeking a deal similar to the one the  San
Diego Chargers  made in 2004, when they sent the rights to top
selection Eli Manning to the  New York Giants  for two first-round
picks, a third-round choice and a fifth-round pick, ESPN said.  Manning has helped the Giants to two Super Bowl wins at
quarterback, while the Chargers used those draft picks to select
quarterback Philip Rivers, linebacker Shawne Merriman and
placekicker Nate Kaeding, all of whom made the Pro Bowl.  To contact the reporter on this story:
