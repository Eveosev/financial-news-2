Colombia ’s peso rose to an almost
seven-month high on speculation the central bank’s daily dollar
purchases won’t be enough to ease the local currency’s rally
amid rising foreign investment into the South American country.  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 1,767.35 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,772.01 yesterday. Earlier it touched 1,762.07, the
strongest intraday level since Aug. 2. The currency has advanced
10.3 percent in the past three months, the third-best performer
after the South African rand and the Polish zloty among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Toronto-based ratings company DBRS’s announcement yesterday
that it raised the outlook on Colombia’s foreign credit ratings
to positive from stable is helping fuel gains in the peso,
according to William Florez, an analyst at  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) ’s
brokerage unit in Bogota. DBRS rates Colombia BBB(low), the
lowest level of investment grade.  “There’s a lot of appetite for Colombian assets from
investors abroad and news like that just helps it even more,”
Florez said. “While Banco de la Republica’s dollar purchases
are helping ease the appreciation accelerator, they don’t
reverse the trend.”  Banco de la Republica said Feb. 24 it will extend a program
of daily purchases of a minimum of $20 million in auctions begun
Feb. 6 to at least Aug. 4, from the initially announced minimum
three-month period. The announcement came after policy makers
said they raised the overnight lending rate a quarter percentage
point to 5.25 percent, as forecast by 22 of 36 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
7.33 percent, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.199 centavo to 121.225 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
