Portugal ’s financial aid program is
on track, the  International Monetary Fund  said in a joint
statement with the European Commission and  European Central
Bank .  “Challenges remain” as the country’s economy contracts
this year, the statement said. Portugal should step up its
efforts on structural reforms, the IMF, Commission and ECB said.  Portugal’s budget deficit target of 4.5 percent of gross
domestic product for this year “remains within reach,” the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
