The lira strengthened for a second
day and yields fell for the first time in five days after  oil
prices  retreated from their highs.  The Turkish currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 1.7593 at
11:32 a.m. in Istanbul.  Yields (BENCH)  on two-year benchmark debt
retreated four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 9.30
percent. WTI Crude April futures ended last week at 109.77, the
highest since May.  Oil prices dropped for a second day in  New York  on
speculation rising U.S. stockpiles signal easing fuel demand as
crude trades near the highest price in nine months.  Turkey 
depends on imports for almost all of its energy requirements. It
paid $54 billion last year for energy imports, 22 percent of its
total import bill, the Ankara-based statistics office shows,
pushing the nation’s current-account deficit to a record high at
10 percent of gross domestic product.  “We are seeing a reaction in the market and oil prices
provided the excuse and gave depth to this movement,” Bulent Topbas, a  fund manager  who helps manage $100 million at Strateji
Menkul Degerler in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  The lira has rallied 7.5 percent this year after slumping
18 percent last year in the biggest decline worldwide. Yields on
Turkish two-year benchmark debt have fallen 171 basis points
this year after soaring 390 basis points last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
