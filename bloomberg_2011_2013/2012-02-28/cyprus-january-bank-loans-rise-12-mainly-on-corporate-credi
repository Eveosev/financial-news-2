Bank lending in Cyprus increased by
12 percent to 68.4 billion euros ($92 billion) in January
compared to a year ago, mainly because of a rise in credit to
companies, the central bank said.  Loans to non-financial corporations rose 13 percent in
January to 30.9 billion euros, the  Central Bank of Cyprus  said
in a  statement  on its website today. Loans to other financial
intermediaries increased 36 percent to 9.2 billion euros, mainly
on a doubling of credit to firms of this type residing outside
the euro area to 4 billion euros.  Household lending rose by 5.4 percent to 27.1 billion
euros, according to the statement.  Housing loans, which were until November the driving force
behind household credit, increased 4.8 percent to 15.1 billion
euros.  Deposits at banks fell 0.7 percent to 69.6 billion euros
last month compared with a year before, even as deposits held by
other euro-area residents rose 32 percent to 5.5 billion euros,
the central bank said.  -- Editors:  Chris Peterson , Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
