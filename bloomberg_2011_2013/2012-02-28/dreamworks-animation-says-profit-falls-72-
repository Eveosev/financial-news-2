DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) , maker
of the “Kung Fu Panda” films, said fourth-quarter profit
tumbled 72 percent, reflecting lower DVD sales.  Net income fell to $24.3 million, or 29 cents a share, from
$85.2 million, or 99 cents, a year earlier, the Glendale,
California-based company said today in a  statement . Analysts
projected profit of 31 cents excluding items, the average of 13
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Kung Fu Panda 2,” one of two films DreamWorks Animation
released in 2011, reached the home-video market in mid-December.
 Michael Pachter , an analyst at Wedbush Securities in Los
Angeles, cut his profit estimate in a Feb. 24 note, citing weak
holiday demand for DVDs. This month, DreamWorks Animation
announced plans to develop entertainment products in  China .  “The overall home-entertainment environment remains
challenging,” Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Katzenberg  said
on a conference call. Consumer purchases of digital copies of
movies remain “modest,” he said.  Fourth-quarter sales declined 21 percent to $219 million
from $275.7 million a year earlier, beating analysts’
projections of $205.1 million.  DreamWorks Animation plans to announce new distribution
arrangements for its films by midyear or later, Katzenberg said.
Viacom Inc.’s Paramount Pictures distributes its movies under a
deal that expires at the end of this year.  “We are looking at this as a major strategic opportunity
for us,” Katzenberg said. “We think there are a number of
different options. We want to explore all of them.”  DreamWorks Animation fell as much as 8.7 percent to $17.95
in extended  trading . The shares rose 2.1 percent to $19.65 at
the close in  New York  and have gained 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
