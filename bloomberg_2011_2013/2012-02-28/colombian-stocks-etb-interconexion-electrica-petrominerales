unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10:24 a.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  fell 1 percent to 14,655.01, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.9 percent to 1,690.72.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota SA  (ETB CB), the

plans.  ETB, as the company is known, fell 8 percent, the most
intraday since July 25, to 451 pesos. ETB’s board said it will
propose in a March 28 shareholders meeting that the company not
pay a dividend in order to boost investment in a two-year
strategic plan aimed at “seeking new lines of business and
modernizing the company,” according to a regulatory filing
yesterday.  Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA)  , a Colombian energy
company, fell 1.8 percent to 11,020, the lowest intraday level

to 337 billion pesos ($191 million), missing analysts’
estimates.  Net income was 344 billion pesos in the year-earlier
period, the company known as ISA said yesterday in a statement
on the website of Colombia’s securities regulator. Two analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg had a median estimate of 402.3 billion
pesos.  Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC)  (PMGC CB), a Calgary-based company that
explores for and produces oil in Colombia, dropped for a second
day, falling 11 percent to a two-month low of 30,020 pesos.
