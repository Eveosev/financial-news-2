Malaysia’s ringgit gained, headed
for a third monthly advance, on speculation a decline in energy
prices will support the nation’s export-led economic recovery.  Crude- oil prices  fell for a second day, dropping 0.1
percent to $108.45 a barrel in New York, after hitting a nine-
month high last week. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index
halted a two-day drop before the  European Central Bank  allots a
second round of three-year loans to regional financial
institutions.  “There is some relief from the fall in oil prices,” said
Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd.
“The market is expecting a further boost from the liquidity
injection from the European Central Bank.”  The ringgit added 0.5 percent to 3.0100 per dollar as of
4:09 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has advanced 1 percent this month.  Five-year  government bonds  were little changed. The yield
on the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016 held at 3.22
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. That was the highest level
since Jan. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
