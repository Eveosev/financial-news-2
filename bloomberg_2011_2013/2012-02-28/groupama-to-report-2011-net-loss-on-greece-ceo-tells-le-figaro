Groupama SA (GPAS) , a French customer-owned
insurer, will report a 2011 net loss due to costs of more than 2
billion euros ($2.7 billion) stemming from the Greek debt
crisis, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Martel told Le Figaro in
an interview.  Stock market declines also cost 1.2 billion euros from its
stake in  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA and 600 million euros from its
holdings in Veolia  Environnement SA (ALTEV) , Martel said, according to
the text of the interview published in the newspaper.  Martel said operating results were “very good” and that
the insurer’s economic fundamentals were “very strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
