UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s Pioneer Global Asset
Management SpA, which oversees about 162 billion euros ($218
billion), plans to add portfolio managers in the U.S. and expand
in  Asia  as part of its five-year business plan.  “We are making a significant investment over the next five
years to hire additional investment talent,” Pioneer said in a
statement today. It said the investments will be “self-
funded.”  The asset manager wants to boost its business in the U.S.
by hiring “experienced investment talent to broaden
capabilities in fixed income and U.S. equities,” and by
expanding its retail distribution network. The company plans to
increase its sales staff in the U.S. by 25 percent.  The company is seeking to boost business in Asia by
increasing its presence in Taiwan and entering new markets
including  South Korea .  Pioneer defined a business plan for stand-alone growth
after UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank, decided last year not to
sell the unit after a review concluded in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
