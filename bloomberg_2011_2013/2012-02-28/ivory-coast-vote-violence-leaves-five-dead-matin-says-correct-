(Corrects location of Bonon in second paragraph.)  Five people were killed in  Ivory
Coast  on Feb. 26 in violence following legislative by-elections,
Fraternité Matin reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  Clashes erupted when the headquarters of the candidate of
the ruling Rassemblement des Republicains in Bonon in western
Ivory Coast was attacked by unidentified gunmen, the state-
controlled newspaper said. Four people were injured, it said.  By-elections were organized in 12 Ivorian electoral
districts following irregularities in a parliamentary election
in December. A convoy of the United Nations Operation in Côte
d’Ivoire carrying ballot boxes was also fired on by unidentified
gunmen, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
