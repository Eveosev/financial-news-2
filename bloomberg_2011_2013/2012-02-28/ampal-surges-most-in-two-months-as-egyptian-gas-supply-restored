Ampal-American Israel (AMPL)  Corp., which
owns a stake in a company that exports natural gas from Egypt to
Israel, rallied the most in almost two months after gas supply
from the North African country was restored.  Shares of Ampal , which owns 12.5 percent of East
Mediterranean Gas Co., gained 12 percent, the most since Jan. 8,
to 1.1650 shekels at 3:49 p.m. in  Tel Aviv .  Gas supply from Egypt to Israel was halted on Feb. 5 after
an explosion overnight at the Sinai pipeline grid, Ampal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
