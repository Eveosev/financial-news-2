India  plans to auction a stake in
 Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  in the “next couple of days” after
failing to meet a revenue target from public offerings of shares
in state-owned companies this year.  A panel of ministers, which met today, decided on the sale
of a 5 percent stake in ONGC and set a minimum price for the
shares, Oil Minister S. Jaipal Reddy told reporters in  New Delhi 
today, without giving more information. The state owns 74
percent of the nation’s biggest energy explorer.  The stock exchanges will be notified tonight about the
auction, Reddy said. The sale will be open for one day, he said.  A 25 percent slump in the benchmark  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  in 2011
undermined efforts to sell shares of state-owned companies, with
the government meeting 3 percent of its 400 billion rupee ($8.1
billion) target for the year ending March 31. The budget
shortfall may widen beyond Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee’s
goal of 4.6 percent as slowing economic growth reduces revenue
receipts.  ONGC  shares  rose 0.8 percent to 283.40 rupees at close in
Mumbai, valuing the 5 percent stake at 121.3 billion rupees. The
Sensex index has rebounded 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
