China ’s money-market rate touched a
three-week low on speculation the supply of cash is increasing
since the reduction in banks’ reserve ratios took effect.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped for a third day after the People’s
Bank of China suspended one-year bill sales for a ninth week.
The central bank issued 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) of 28-day
repurchase contracts, according to a trader required to bid at
the auctions.  “Liquidity has improved a lot after the reserve-ratio cut
became effective on Feb. 24,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in
Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest
lender. “The central bank probably won’t resume bill sales this
week because bill redemptions are too low.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate  was steady at 3.66 percent as
of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched
3.45 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 6.  A total of 2 billion yuan of central bank bills and
repurchase contracts will mature this week, Liu said.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was unchanged at
3.35 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
on the 3.44 percent government bond due June 2016 was unchanged
at 3.16 percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
