Kenya ’s shilling fell for a third
day on demand for dollars from oil importers and after a tea
auction was halted for a second day, which could restrict supply
of the U.S. currency next week.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy weakened 0.4
percent to 82.95 per dollar as of 2:33 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital.  “It’s the usual end-month buyers coming to the market for
dollars,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial
Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  The world’s biggest tea auction, held weekly in Kenya, has
been halted because of a dispute between the government and
traders over a new tax imposition. It “could effect dollar
inflows next week,” Kinuthia said.  Tanzania’s shilling appreciated 0.6 percent at 1,590 per
dollar.  “Corporate clients are dumping dollars to get shillings to
meet end-of month payment obligations like salaries and taxes,”
Yonoh Mtengule, chief economist at the National Bank of Commerce
Ltd.,  ABSA Group Ltd. (ASA) ’s Tanzania unit, said by phone today from
 Dar es Salaam , the commercial Capital.   The Ugandan shilling snapped two days of losses,
strengthening 0.1 percent to 2,367.49 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
