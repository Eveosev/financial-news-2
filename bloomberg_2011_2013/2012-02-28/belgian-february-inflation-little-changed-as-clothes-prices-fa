Belgium ’s inflation rate was little
changed at 3.66 percent in February as lower prices for clothing
and shoes helped offset the higher cost of cut flowers and
vegetables.  The inflation rate in Belgium, the sixth-largest economy in
the euro region, compared with 3.65 percent in January, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs in Brussels said today in an e-
mailed statement. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.59 percent.  Excluding energy, inflation accelerated to 2.38 percent
from 2.24 percent in January, according to today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
