Oil production in  North Dakota  may
have exceeded an all-time high last month as mild weather and
lower-than-normal snowfall allowed drilling to increase.  The number of wells started rose to 212 in January from 181
in December and 140 a year earlier, according to a preliminary
estimate from Alison Ritter, a spokeswoman for the  North Dakota (BAKKNODA) 
Department of Mineral Resources.  “A lot of people are going to be blindsided by
fundamentals and an increase in oil production,”  Hamza Khan , an
analyst with Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , said
by phone. “Production will increase and prices will fall.”  The state’s output reached a record of 535,036 barrels a
day in December as improved technology has made it profitable
for producers to tap crude trapped in tight underground shale
formations. The Bakken Shale, which extends south from Canada
into North Dakota,  South Dakota  and Montana, is the largest
contiguous oil deposit in the continental U.S.  Temperatures in December and January were 12 to 14 degrees
Fahrenheit higher than the previous year, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .
Temperatures this month through Feb. 26 ranged 4 to 10 degrees
above normal. North Dakota has received 25 inches less snow than
normal, he said.  “They’ve had very little snowpack this year,” Rogers
said, noting that winter storms are forecast for the region this
week. “There may be a last gasp here, but it has been much
warmer than normal.”  Rig Count  As of Feb. 28, 205 rigs were drilling in North Dakota
compared with an average of 167 in February 2011, according to
the Industrial Commission of North Dakota, Oil & Gas Division
 website .  The state’s oil production has quadrupled since 2005, with
average daily output rising to 418,426 barrels in 2011 compared
with 97,435 in 2005, according to data from the Industrial
Commission of North Dakota’s Oil & Gas Commission.  “The Bakken production has probably exceeded anyone’s
forecast,”  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates in
Houston, said today.  Oil has increased 9.3 percent this year to $108.02 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as a European embargo of
Iranian crude heightened tension with the Islamic republic and
raised concern that Middle East exports may be disrupted.  Companies trying to take advantage of rising prices are
curtailing natural gas production to drill for crude. U.S. oil
output reached 5.842 million barrels a day in November, the
highest level since April 2002.  Drillers are using the same techniques that unleashed a
boom in natural gas production, pushing gas stockpiles to record
highs while prices plummeted. Futures fell to $2.322 per million
British thermal units on Jan. 25, the lowest since Feb. 25,
2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
