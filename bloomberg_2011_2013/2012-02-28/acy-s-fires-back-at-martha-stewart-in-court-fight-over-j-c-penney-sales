Macy’s Inc. (M)  asked a court to reject
counterclaims by  Martha Stewart  Living Omnimedia Inc. in their
legal dispute over a plan to open mini-boutiques in department
stores operated by  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)   Macy’s sued in January to stop New York-based Martha
Stewart Living from executing the agreement to sell merchandise
in J.C. Penney stores. Macy’s, based in Cincinnati, said it has
the exclusive right to sell Martha Stewart-branded products in
certain categories.  Martha Stewart Living defended its agreement with J.C.
Penney in counterclaims filed earlier this month, accusing
Macy’s of breach of contract and saying that the retailer has
stocked and priced Martha Stewart products in a manner that
favors Macy’s own private-label brands.  Macy’s said in court papers filed yesterday in New York
state Supreme Court in Manhattan that the proportion of sales
for exclusive and limited distribution brands, including those
that the retailer licenses from third parties such as  Martha
Stewart Living (MSO)  has increased since 2007, while the proportion of
sales for its private labels has remained about the same.  Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for Martha Stewart Living,
declined immediate comment on the court papers filed by Macy’s.  The case is Macy’s Inc. v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., 650197/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
