Moldova  stopped exporting grain
after the government said about 33 percent of the winter crop
was lost, according to UkrAgroConsult.  The former Soviet nation will have to import wheat flour
this year, UkrAgroConsult said, citing Agriculture Minister
Vasile Bumacov. Carryover stocks will meet domestic wheat demand
until September, the Kiev-based agricultural researcher said in
an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
