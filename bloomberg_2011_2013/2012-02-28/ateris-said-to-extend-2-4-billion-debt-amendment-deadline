Materis SA has pushed back a
deadline for lenders to approve extending maturities on about
1.8 billion euros ($2.4 billion) of debt, according to a person
with direct knowledge of the proposal.  The building materials supplier, owned by private-equity
firm  Wendel (MF) , has got the minimum two-thirds consent for the
extension and is keeping the process open until March 9 to get
at least a 90 percent approval rate, said the person, who
declined to be identified as the negotiations are private. The
original deadline was Feb. 24.  Materis offered lenders increased interest of 4.5
percentage points more than the euro interbank offered rate to
extend to 2016 the maturities on senior loans due in 2013, 2014
and 2015, two people said Feb. 17.  Under the proposal the interest margin on Materis’s loans
will drop to 4 percentage points, or 400 basis points, if the
company’s debt is less than 4.25 times its earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, the people said.
That compares with a ratio of 4.75 under a proposal made in
October.  Wendel bought Materis for about 2 billion euros in 2006,
with lenders led by agent BNP Paribas SA providing about 1.97
billion euros of loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Christele Lion, a spokeswoman for Paris-based Wendel,
couldn’t immediately comment.  Materis has also asked to lengthen the maturities of its
second-lien loans to March 2016 and extend its mezzanine debt to
December 2016, said the people. It’s also seeking permission to
sell as much as 700 million euros of high-yield bonds to
refinance debt and to add 50 million euros to a working capital
facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
