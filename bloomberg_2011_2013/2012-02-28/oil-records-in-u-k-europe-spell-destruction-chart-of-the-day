Oil prices  breached records in euros
and pounds and are approaching all-time highs in Indian rupees
and Brazilian reais, raising the prospect that consumer demand
will deteriorate, according to Morgan Stanley.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the cost of a barrel of Brent
crude in dollars, British pounds, euros, Indian rupees, Chinese
yuan and Brazilian reais, expressed as a percentage of the
previous record in those currencies. The price rose to 79.28
pounds on Feb. 23, 2 percent higher than the previous record set
in April. Oil climbed to 93.71 euros yesterday, compared with a
high of 93.46 euros in July 2008.  “Oil prices are already at record highs in many important
places that have already been struggling with slowing growth,”
 Hussein Allidina , head of commodities research at Morgan Stanley
in New York, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “That is
demand destruction. I wouldn’t rule out the likelihood of seeing
no demand growth this year.”  The International Energy Agency cut its 2012 global oil
demand forecast for a sixth month on Feb. 10 as a “darkening”
economic outlook reduced prospects for growth. Worldwide oil
consumption will increase by 800,000 barrels a day to an annual
89.9 million barrels a day, the agency said, after the
 International Monetary Fund  last month cut its global economic
growth prediction.  Europe accounted for 25 percent of global crude imports in
2010 and India 8.6 percent, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical
Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
