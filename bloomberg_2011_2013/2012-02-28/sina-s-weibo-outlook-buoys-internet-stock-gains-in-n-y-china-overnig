Chinese Internet stocks  climbed, led
by  Sina Corp. (SINA) , after the company said its Twitter-like Weibo
service may start contributing to sales in the second half.  Sina, owner of China’s third-most visited website, was the
biggest gainer on the  Bloomberg China-US 55 index  of the most-
traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. which added 1.7 percent, the
steepest climb in seven weeks, to 108.61 yesterday in New York.
 Youku Inc. (YOKU) , owner of China’s largest video sharing website,
surged to a six-month high, while  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , operator of
China’s biggest search engine, advanced the most since Feb. 9.  Shanghai-based Sina has jumped 35 percent this year as
Weibo users rose by about 50 million to more than 300 million in
the past three months, according to Chief Executive Officer
Charles Chao. Prospects the government will take further steps
to preserve  Chinese growth , the fastest of major economies, has
helped drive a 13 percent gain in the Bloomberg China-US 55
measure in 2012. Policy makers cut the reserve ratio for banks
for the second time in three months on Feb. 24.  “China’s Internet stocks, especially the bigger names like
Sina and Baidu, still have lots of room for growth going
forward,” Agnes Deng, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager whose
$405 million Greater China Fund invests in Chinese equities,
said in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in  New York 
yesterday. “China will be able to maintain growth of more than
8 percent this year and further easing will be positive for
Chinese equities.”  Shanghai-based Sina leaped 11 percent to $70.04 yesterday,
the most since Jan. 27. The stock earlier surged as much as 14
percent.  ‘Meaningful Monetization’  The company plans to start “meaningful monetization” of
Weibo in the second half of 2012, CEO Chao said on a conference
call yesterday.  “We do not expect that total monetization on Weibo will be
significant this year,” he said. The company will start a
Weibo-based display advertising system in the second quarter and
several fee-based services beginning in the second half, Chao
said.  Weibo may contribute $20 million to $30 million to Sina
revenue in 2012, Andy Yeung, a New York-based analyst at
Oppenheimer & Co Inc. wrote yesterday in a research note.  Sina’s net income came in at $9.3 million in the fourth
quarter, from a net loss of $100 million a year earlier and a
loss of $336.3 million in the previous three months, it said in
a Feb. 27 statement. The company expects sales to be between
$101 million and $104 million in the first quarter of 2012.  ‘Valuation Levels’  Deng at the Greater  China  Fund said she is looking for
better “valuation levels” to buy Internet stocks including
Sina, after selling holdings of the company when its stock price
reached $140 in April.  The fund  she manages has increased 18
percent this year after posting a 23 percent loss in 2011.  Sina is  trading  at about 76 times its estimated earnings
over the next four quarters. The multiple has risen from 11 in
March 2009 to a record high of 115 in September of 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 1.5 percent to $40.29
yesterday, extending a 3.8 percent advance this month. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added 0.3 percent to 1,372.18,
closing above 13,000 for the first time since May 2008.  Beijing-based Youku surged 10 percent to $25.39 in New
York, the highest level since Aug. 17. Youku’s competitor  Tudou
Holdings Ltd. (TUDO) , China’s second-largest video sharing website,
advanced 5.2 percent to $15.99, the most in three weeks.  Macau Revenue  Youku is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results on
March 14. Sales for the quarter probably rose 97 percent from a
year earlier to 300.07 million yuan ($47.6 million), according
to the average estimate of five analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
That would exceed the company’s previous forecast of 297.3
million yuan.  American depositary receipts of Macau casino operator  Melco
Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  rose 4.3 percent to a five-month high
of $12.78 in New York trading, 3.2 percent above its  Hong Kong 
stock, the largest  premium  since Feb. 16. Each ADR represents
three common shares. Melco’s shares traded in Hong Kong were
unchanged at HK$32 yesterday, the equivalent of 4.13 per share.  Gaming revenue for the first 26 days of February in Macau,
the only place in China where gambling is legal, indicates sales
in the month are up about 20 percent from a year ago, Harry Curtis, an analyst at Nomura Securities International Inc., said
in a client note yesterday.  Dangdang Gains  ADRs of  China Southern Airlines Co. (ZNH) ,  Asia ’s biggest carrier
by passenger numbers, added 2.9 percent to $24.92, the largest
daily advance in three weeks. The ADRs, each representing 50
common shares, were 0.9 percent  below  Hong Kong stock, after
trading at a premium in the previous five trading sessions. The
company’s Shanghai-traded shares slid 1.1 percent to 5.42 yuan,
or 86 U.S. cents per share.  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , the biggest Internet-based
online book retailer in China, advanced 8.9 percent to $6.84 in
New York, the biggest gain in a month. Baidu, based in Beijing,
rose 2.8 percent to $138.29.  Renren Inc. (RENN) , a Beijing-based social
networking website, jumped 6.2 percent to $5.46.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , which owns the third-biggest search engine,
rose 3.1 percent to $50.57 while online games operator
 NetEase.com Inc. (NTES)  climbed 4.2 percent to $53.31.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.2 percent to 2,451.86
yesterday, the highest level since Nov. 17, extending gains this
month to 7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
