Tsutomu Une, chairman of  Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) , comments on the outlook for generic Lipitor
sales. Une, a senior executive officer at  Daiichi Sankyo Co. (4568) ,
was appointed chairman of Ranbaxy in May 2009 after the Tokyo-
based drugmaker acquired control the previous year. He made the
comments on a conference call.  “We’ll maintain the current market share of more than 40
percent in the U.S. going forward. Ranbaxy has a strong
relationship with its business partners and that’s what’s
helping Ranbaxy gain such market share.”  On the consent decree:  “It’s a five-year project. Ranbaxy signed a contract with
Arun Sawhney to be the chief executive officer for the next five
years, as of Jan. 1, to command and complete the project.  ‘‘The decree is in effect as of Jan. 26. Ranbaxy is hiring
outside consultants to improve the manufacturing practices and
setting up an independent committee to check manufacturing data
before filing future products for marketing approval to the
regulators.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
