Calfrac Well Services Ltd. (CFW) , which
provides drilling services for oil and natural-gas producers,
rose the most in more than two years after the company reported
record fourth-quarter sales.  Calfrac rose 9.4 percent to C$30.39 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest gain since Sept. 4, 2009.  An increase in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in  Canada 
and the U.S. helped boost fourth-quarter revenue 82 percent to
C$490 million ($492 million) from the year-earlier period,
Calgary-based Calfrac said in a statement. Net income increased
almost five-fold to C$78.9 million from C$16.1 million.  Calfrac provides fracking services, in which large truck-
mounted pumps blast a mixture of water, chemicals and sand into
wells to increase the flow. The company is expanding operations
in the Marcellus, Bakken and Niobrara shale fields in the U.S.,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
