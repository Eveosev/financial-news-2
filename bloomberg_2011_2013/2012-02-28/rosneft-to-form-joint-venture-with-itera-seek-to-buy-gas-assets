(Corrects second paragraph after Rosneft corrects reserves 
in initial phase to 600 billion cubic meters, removes potential 
to produce 40 billion cubic meters of gas a year in next several 
years from statement on website.)  OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, agreed to form a venture with OOO Itera to jointly
develop natural-gas assets and seek acquisitions.  Rosneft and Itera, a non-state gas explorer, plan to
develop deposits with reserves of 600 billion cubic meters, the
state-controlled oil producer said today on its website.  The companies will start by developing Itera assets and
later add some of Rosneft’s, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
