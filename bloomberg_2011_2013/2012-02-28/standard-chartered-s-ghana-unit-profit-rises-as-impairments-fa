Standard Chartered Bank Ghana Ltd. (SCB) ,
the second-biggest lender on the Ghanaian bourse, said full-year
profit rose as impairment charges declined.  Net income climbed 7.6 percent to 77.7 million cedis ($45.7
million), the Accra-based lender said in a statement e-mailed by
the  Ghana Stock Exchange (GGSECI)  today. The bank’s operating expenses
declined by 9.2 percent to 93.5 million cedis while impairment
losses decreased 28 percent to 9.8 million cedis, the bank, a
unit of London-based Standard Chartered Plc, said.  “The bank will tend to ride on its competitive advantage
for growth this year, such as its strong balance sheet that
supports huge deals,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Accra-
based Databank Financial Services Ltd., said in an e-mailed
response to questions.  Net interest income, the money earned from lending,
decreased 1.5 percent to 150.4 million cedis even as loans
granted increased 28 percent to 596.7 million cedis, the bank
said. Investments in short-term  government securities  almost
tripled to 170.1 million cedis, Standard Chartered Bank said.  Standard Chartered Bank’s shares rose 0.6 percent to 49.8
cedis by the close of trading in Accra, the capital.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
