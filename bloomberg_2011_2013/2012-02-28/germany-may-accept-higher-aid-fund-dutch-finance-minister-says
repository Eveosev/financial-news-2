Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  said he expects Germany may eventually agree to raising
the European rescue fund to fight the region’s sovereign debt
crisis.  “I think that we can say that in the end, when everything
comes together and everyone has taken sufficient steps,
including the southern European countries, that eventually
Germany could take its responsibility,” De Jager said late
yesterday in response to a lawmaker’s question about Germany’s
refusal to raise the fund. “But that’s up to Germany.”  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said on Feb. 27 that
there’s currently no need to increase the lending capacity of
 Europe ’s bailout mechanisms, citing lower borrowing costs for
heavily indebted euro-area states. De Jager said a decision on
the size of the European rescue fund may be made ahead of the
spring meeting of the  International Monetary Fund  in April.  “We’ve had informal contacts and hope that there we can
decide about the IMF contribution. ‘‘That suggests that there
will be pressure on one country, which hasn’t made this step
yet, to make that step before that date,” De Jager told the
Dutch parliament, referring to Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
