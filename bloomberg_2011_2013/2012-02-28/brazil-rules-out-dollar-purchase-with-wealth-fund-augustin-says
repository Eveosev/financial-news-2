Brazil ’s government doesn’t plan at
the moment to use the country’s sovereign wealth fund to
purchase dollars, Treasury Secretary Arno Agustin said today.  While the fund can be used to intervene in the currency
market, “we haven’t carried out that possibility yet,”
Augustin told reporters in Brasilia today. “We continue with a
currency policy that is concentrated at the central bank.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
