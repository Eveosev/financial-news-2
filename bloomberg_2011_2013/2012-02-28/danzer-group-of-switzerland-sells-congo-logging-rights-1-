Danzer Group of  Switzerland  sold its
logging titles in  Democratic Republic  of Congo to Kinshasa-based
Groupe Blattner Elwyn, said Anette Weidner, a spokeswoman for
Danzer.  The Baar, Switzerland-based group sold its two Congolese
units including Siforco, which manages about 1.9 million
hectares of forest and has operated in Congo since 1972,
according to a  statement  on Danzer’s website.  “After careful consideration of the economic, political
and logistical situation in the DRC, Danzer took the strategic
decision to focus its efforts on its activities” in neighboring
Congo Republic, Weidner said in an e-mailed response to
questions. She declined to give further details.  Two calls to a phone number listed on Groupe Blattner
Elwyn’s website were not answered.  Danzer is the world’s largest manufacturer of hardwood
veneers, according to its website. The group’s subsidiary
Industrie Forestiere d’Ouesso runs more than 1 million hectares
of forest in Congo Republic certified by the Forest Stewardship
Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
