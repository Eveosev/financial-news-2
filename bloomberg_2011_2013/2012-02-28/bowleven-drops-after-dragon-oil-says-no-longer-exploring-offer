BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , the U.K. oil explorer
focused on Cameroon, plunged after  Dragon Oil Plc (DGO)  said it’s no
longer exploring an offer for all of the company.  Shares fell 24 percent, the most since April 2009, to trade
at 102 pence as of the 4:30 p.m. close in London. Dragon Oil
rose 3.1 percent to 599 pence. Dragon said today it won’t
consider a bid after announcing interest in BowLeven on Feb. 17.  BowLeven discovered oil in October in the  Douala Basin  at
the Etinde permit in Cameroon. It raised $124 million in a share
sale on Oct. 19 with a 36 percent increase in ordinary stock
capital to fund a drilling program this year.  In a separate statement, BowLeven said that no detailed
discussions were held with Dragon and no due diligence
information was provided.  A spokesman for Dragon Oil declined to comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
