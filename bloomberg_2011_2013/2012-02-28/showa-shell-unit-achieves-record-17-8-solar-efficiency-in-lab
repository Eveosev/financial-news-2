Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002) ’s Solar
Frontier unit reached a record 17.8 percent efficiency in
converting sunlight to power in part of a thin-film panel using
a process it plans to replicate in its factory in Japan.  The test result exceeded its March 2011 record of 17.2
percent, the Tokyo-based company said today in an emailed
statement. Modules produced at Solar Frontier’s factory in
southern Japan’s Miyazaki prefecture can convert as much as
13.38 percent of the sun’s rays into electricity.  Boosting photovoltaic efficiency increases output and
reduces the cost of the electricity produced by the panel. Solar
Frontier is the world’s biggest producer of thin-film solar
panels made with copper-indium-gallium-selenide.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  of Tempe,  Arizona , is the largest maker of
thin-film panels and uses a different semiconducting material
called cadmium-telluride that achieved 17.3 percent efficiency
in a lab last year.  Thin-film solar manufacturers apply the compounds directly
onto sheets of glass in a more automated process than used with
standard photovoltaic panels made of polysilicon, which are
largely made in  China  and assembled in stages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
