Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Greifeld , who oversaw a failed $11.3
billion bid for NYSE Euronext last year, signed a five-year
employment extension with the New York-based exchange operator.  Greifeld will get a base salary of at least $1 million and
additional compensation of twice that annually if he meets one
or more performance goals each year, according to a regulatory
filing. He can’t work for a competitor for two years after
leaving the company, the filing said.  The deal follows Nasdaq OMX’s attempt with Atlanta-based
 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  to purchase the owner of the  New
York  Stock Exchange, which had agreed to a takeover by Deutsche
Boerse Group AG in Frankfurt. Nasdaq and ICE withdrew their
offer for  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  on May 16 after the Justice Department
said it would block the deal because it would give the combined
entity too much sway over corporate listings and other services.
Antitrust regulators in Europe prevented the Deutsche Boerse
transaction on Feb. 1.  Nasdaq OMX also extended General Counsel Edward S. Knight’s
employment with a five-year contract. Knight, who is also the
company’s chief regulatory officer, can’t work for or provide
services to a competing exchange for 12 months after his
departure, according to the filing. The employment terms went
into effect for both men on Feb. 22, the filing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
