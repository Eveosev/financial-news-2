BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
asset manager, rehired Joshua Levine from Legg Mason Inc.’s
Permal Group hedge-fund unit to become co-head of pensions.  Levine, a director of BlackRock’s Latin American
institutional business before he left in late 2007 to join
Permal, will be a member of the U.S. and  Canada  institutional
team within BlackRock’s Global Client Group, said  Brian Beades ,
a spokesman for the New York-based firm. He will report to Edwin
Conway.  Levine will lead the group with Al Goduti and be
responsible for developing and maintaining relationships with
institutional investors, specifically public and corporate
pension plans on the East Coast and in the Midwest, Beades said.  BlackRock manages $3.5 trillion in assets, about 62 percent
of which is for institutional clients, including pensions.  The hiring of Levine was reported earlier today by Dow
Jones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
