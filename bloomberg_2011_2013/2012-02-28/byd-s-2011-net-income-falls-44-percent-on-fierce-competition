BYD Co. (1211) , the Chinese carmaker partly
owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , reported a 44
percent drop in net income because of “fierce” competition and
slowing sales of solar-energy products.  Profit declined to 1.4 billion yuan ($222 million) in 2011
from 2.52 billion yuan in 2010, the Shenzhen-based company said
in a preliminary earnings statement to the city’s exchange
yesterday. That compares with an average  estimate  of 968 million
yuan of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 1.2
percent to 49 billion yuan.  “Fierce competition and structural changes in products,”
as well as lower prices for solar-energy products, contributed
to reduced profitability, according to the statement. The
company said on Oct. 28 that full-year profit might decline as
much as 65 percent.  Demand for BYD’s cars slowed after the government ended
buying incentives and the popularity of its top-selling F3 sedan
waned. The automaker’s third-quarter vehicle sales fell 3.3
percent from a year earlier to 93,960 units, according to China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers data.  BYD, formed 16 years ago as a battery maker, began
developing electric cars in 2003 when it expanded into
automaking. It began selling its E6 electric car to individuals
in October, after testing it as a taxi in Shenzhen.  BYD has risen 48 percent this year in  Hong Kong  trading,
compared with a 17 percent gain for the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index . The stock fell 2 percent to HK$24.90 in Hong Kong
yesterday, before the announcement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
