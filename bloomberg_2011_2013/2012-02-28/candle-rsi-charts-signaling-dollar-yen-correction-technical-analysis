The dollar may weaken almost 1.5
percent against the yen as momentum indicators signal recent
gains in the greenback are poised to reverse, according to
Forecast Pte.  The dollar touched 81.67 yen yesterday, the strongest since
May 31, and closed at 80.61, below the opening price of 81.13.
The currency pair’s candle chart, which displays high, low,
opening and closing levels for each day, shows the dollar has
finished lower than its opening price three of the past four
sessions. The greenback’s 14-day relative strength index was at
72 yesterday, above the 70 level some traders see as a sign an
asset’s price is set to change course.  “The candle formation looks to signal a possible
reversal” of dollar strength, said Pak Lai Ng, a technical
analyst in  Singapore  at Forecast. “I think the dollar is very
overbought now.”  The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 80.09 yen as of 10:50 a.m.
in  Tokyo  from yesterday’s close in  New York .  The dollar faces a “short-term correction” after climbing
more than 5 percent against the yen since the end of January,
according to Ng. The greenback may fall toward 78.85 yen, the 50
percent retracement of the currency’s rise from the Feb. 1 to
yesterday’s high, according to a Fibonacci chart, he said.  After its correction, the dollar may rally toward 85 yen in
the next one to three months, Ng said, citing the currency’s
break above key resistance levels such as the Oct. 31 high of
79.53.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices tend
to drop or rise by certain percentages after reaching a high or
low. In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
