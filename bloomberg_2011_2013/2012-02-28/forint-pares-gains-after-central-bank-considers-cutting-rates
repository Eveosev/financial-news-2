The forint pared gains and
 government bonds  rallied after the country’s central bank
maintained its benchmark rate at the European Union’s highest
after considering a cut to borrowings costs.  Hungary’s currency gained less than 0.1 percent to 290.7
per euro by 4:13 p.m. in Budapest after strengthening as much as
0.5 percent earlier today. The Budapest-based Magyar Nemzeti
Bank kept the two-week deposit rate at 7 percent. The yield on
two year government debt fell 16 basis points to 8.16 percent.  Policy makers considered cutting the rate by a quarter
point before “overwhelmingly” backing no change, central bank
President Andras Simor told a news conference in Budapest. The
central bank unexpectedly held rates last month as four first-
year members of its rate-setting board outvoted Simor and his
two deputies, who sought a third successive half-point increase.  “The key to stability of the Hungarian markets is the
discussion on the IMF/EU bailout deal,” Aurelija Augulyte,
Copenhagen-based emerging-market analyst at  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) ,
wrote in an e-mailed note after the central bank decision.  Hungary’s overhaul of retirement rules for judges, one of
the issues obstructing bailout talks, may end up at the  European
Court  of Justice, Justice Minister Tibor Navracsics said on M1
television today.  “A key concern is that the positive market developments
will make Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government less willing
to compromise, which may backfire,” Augulyte said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
