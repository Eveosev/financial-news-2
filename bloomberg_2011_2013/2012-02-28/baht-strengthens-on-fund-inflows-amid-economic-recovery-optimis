nation’s assets on optimism economic growth is rebounding after
last year’s floods.  Global funds purchased $1.4 billion more Thai equities than
they sold this month through yesterday and bought a net $4.8
billion of government debt, data from the stock exchange and the
Thai Bond Market Association show. Gross domestic product may
increase 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent this year, Arkhom
Termpittayapaisith, secretary general of the National Economic
and Social Development Board, said on Feb. 20, when the
government announced last year’s growth was 0.1 percent.  “Funds keep coming in here, causing the baht to
strengthen,” said Amonthep Chawla, a Bangkok-based analyst at
Kasikornbank Pcl. “Growth in  Asia  is expected to be much larger
than developed countries.”  The baht gained 0.3 percent to 30.39 per dollar as of 3:23

currency touched 30.22 on Feb. 24, the strongest level since

two months, according to the median forecast of economists in a
