white-collar crime and government investigations practice.  “Bill has built a strong experience base and reputation
over the course of his work for the Southern District,” Mark E. Tully, partner and chairman of the firm’s litigation department,
said in the statement.  Goodwin had revenue of $695.5 million in 2011, a
