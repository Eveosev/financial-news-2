Bahrain has formed an investigative
unit to determine accountability for violence during last year’s
protests in line with the recommendations of an independent
commission that looked into human rights abuses, the Information
Affairs Authority said today.  The new unit will be led by a senior public prosecutor and
supported by independent criminal investigators and forensic
experts, the IAA said in an emailed statement. U.S. and German
lawyers are expected in Bahrain in the next few weeks to train
prosecutors in effective investigations, case management and
human rights issues, the statement said.  Mass protests led by Bahrain’s Shiite majority broke out a
year ago demanding democracy and equal rights from the Sunni
monarchy, leading to a crackdown by security forces in which
troops from neighboring  Saudi Arabia , also ruled by Sunnis, were
called in to help. Tensions in the island nation have simmered
in Shiite areas throughout the past year and have recently
spread to the capital, Manama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
