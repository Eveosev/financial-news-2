Romania ended a restriction on power
exports on Feb. 24 after domestic consumption dropped from
record levels caused by freezing temperatures in the first three
weeks of the month,  Mediafax  reported, citing a statement from
 Transelectrica SA (TEL) , the power grid operator.  Transelectrica lifted the restriction, imposed by the
government on Feb. 15, after the weather improved and riversâ€™
water levels increased, boosting hydro-power output, according
to the Bucharest-based news service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
