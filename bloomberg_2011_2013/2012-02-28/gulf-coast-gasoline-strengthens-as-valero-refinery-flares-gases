Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened as
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  reported emissions at the Port Arthur
refinery in Texas.  There was no material impact to production associated with
the emission, Bill Day, a company spokesman in  San Antonio , said
in an e-mailed statement.  The company was investigating the source of the release,
according to a filing with the National Response Center.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
on the Gulf Coast narrowed 2.75 cents to 24.25 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
12:04 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery fell 5.05 cents to $2.9822 a gallon.  The same fuel in New York Harbor widened its discount by
0.12 cent to 2.5 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
