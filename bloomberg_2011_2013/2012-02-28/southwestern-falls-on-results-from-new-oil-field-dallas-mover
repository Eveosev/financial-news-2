Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN) , the biggest
natural-gas producer in Arkansas’ Fayetteville Shale, fell the
most in six weeks after it announced disappointing results from
a new oil field.  The shares dropped 5.7 percent to $33.31 at the close in
New York, the biggest decline since Jan. 11.  Southwestern’s first oil well in the Brown Dense field in
Arkansas produced 103 barrels a day, which was “a
disappointment,”  Scott Hanold , an analyst with RBC Capital
Markets in Minneapolis, wrote in a note to clients today. The
company expects better production from two more wells in the
Brown Dense field, Chief Executive Officer Steven Mueller said
on an earnings webcast today.  Mueller is trying to increase oil production from the Brown
Dense field and the Denver-Julesburg Basin in  Colorado  to offset
low gas prices, which have fallen about 25 percent since the
beginning of the year.  Almost all of Southwestern’s production is gas, Mueller
said in an interview Jan. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
