Nigerian Breweries Plc (NB) , the
country’s biggest brewer by market value, fell by the daily
limit to a three-month low.  The stock sank 5 percent to 91.30 naira as of 2:38 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital. A close at this price will be the
lowest since Nov. 30. The  Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share
Index slipped 1.4 percent.  Nigerian Breweries has lost 7.3 percent in the past three
days. The company will pay a dividend of 3 naira and no bonus,
Renaissance Capital said Feb. 23, citing a report handed out on
the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange.  “The market feels that the dividend yield is lower than
they can get from other sectors,” Tunde Abidoye, Lagos-based
analyst at FBN Capital, said by phone today, without specifying
the other sectors.
