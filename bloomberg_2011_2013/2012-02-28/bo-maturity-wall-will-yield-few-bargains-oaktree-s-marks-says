The wall of leveraged buyout loans
set to mature through 2014 is unlikely to provide many
opportunities for distressed-debt investors, according to  Howard Marks , chairman of Oaktree Capital Management LLC.  Marks was speaking at the SuperReturn International
conference in Berlin today.  On refinancing the debt-maturity wall:  The LBO maturity wall “isn’t enough, that’s stacking the
wood. But what will ignite it? What will create the bargains
from which distressed debt has enjoyed its peak returns?  “If the  capital markets  stay open, there aren’t going to
be a lot of defaults when the maturity wall appears and no great
opportunities for distressed-debt investors.”  “At present, apart from the looming wall of maturity,
there are no specific concrete reasons to be unusually bullish
about these things, so we’re not pounding the table to say this
is peak opportunity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
