The rand advanced to a five-month
high and bonds rose on expectation the  European Central Bank ’s
injection of liquidity into the region’s banks will boost
appetite for South African stocks and debt.  The currency climbed as much as 0.6 percent to 7.5068 per
dollar, the strongest level since Sept. 19. It traded 0.4
percent stronger at 7.5208 per dollar as of 11:45 a.m. in
Johannesburg, a fifth day of gains. The yield on the nation’s 77
billion rand ($10 billion) of 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.86 percent.  The ECB will tomorrow allot a second round of unlimited
three-year funds to lenders. Global  emerging-market stocks 
soared on expectation the long-term refinancing operation, or
LTRO, will boost demand for higher-yielding assets. The rand
gained as much as 1.7 percent on Dec. 21, when the ECB last lent
support to the region’s banks.  “A risk-on environment is prevailing at the moment,”
 George Glynos , an analyst at ETM Analytics in Johannesburg, said
in e-mailed comments. “As we look forward to tomorrow’s LTRO by
the ECB, the significance of this event should not be
underestimated. This has certainly helped emerging-market
currencies and the rand has tagged along.”  European banks are likely to tap the ECB for 470 billion
euros ($632 billion) in three-year funds, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts. That would compare with the
489 billion euros borrowed at the LTRO Dec. 21.  To contact the reporters on this story:
