U.S. stocks extended gains after a
gauge of  consumer confidence  topped estimates, overshadowing an
earlier report showing a bigger-than-forecast decrease in
durable-goods orders.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to
1,371.18 at 10:01 a.m. in  New York .  The Conference Board’s confidence index increased to 70.8
from a revised 61.5 in January, figures from the New York-based
private research group showed today. Economists predicted the
gauge would climb to 63, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
