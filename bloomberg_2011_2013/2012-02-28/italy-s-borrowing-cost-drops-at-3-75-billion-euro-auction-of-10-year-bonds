Italy sold 3.75 billion euros of a
new 10-year bond at 5.5 percent, meeting its target for the
auction, the Rome-based Treasury said today.  The yield compared with 6.08 percent at the last sale of
similar-maturity debt on Jan. 30. The bid-to-cover ratio was 1.4
compared with 1.42 last month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
