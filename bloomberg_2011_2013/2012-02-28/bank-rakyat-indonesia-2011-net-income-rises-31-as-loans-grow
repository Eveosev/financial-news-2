PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) , the
nation’s second-largest bank by assets, said 2011 net income
rose 31.47 percent supported by loan growth.  The Jakarta-based lender reached net income of 15.08
trillion rupiah ($1.65 billion), from 11.47 trillion rupiah a
year earlier, Djarot Kusumayakti, a director at the company,
said in Jakarta today.  Net interest income, or revenue from borrowers after
deducting interest paid to depositors, rose 4.14 percent to 33.8
trillion rupiah last year, from 32.5 trillion rupiah a year
earlier while fee based income increased 1.22 percent to 5.5
trillion rupiah from 5.4 trillion rupiah in 2010.  Bank Rakyat benefits from record low interest rates that
have helped spur loan demand in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy.
The  central bank  lowered its benchmark  interest rate  to 5.75
percent in February after cutting the  reference rate  in October
by a quarter of a percentage point to 6.5 percent and a half of
a percentage point to 6 percent in November to boost consumption.  Lending grew 14.83 percent to 283.58 trillion rupiah, less
than an average 24.5 percent credit-growth for all commercial
banks last year. This year, the lender expects lending to
accelerate 20 percent to 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
