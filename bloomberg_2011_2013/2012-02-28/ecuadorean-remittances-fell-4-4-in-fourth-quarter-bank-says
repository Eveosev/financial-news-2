Remittances from Ecuadoreans living
abroad fell 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter to $647 million
from a year earlier as economic slowdowns in  Europe  and the U.S.
reduced immigrantsâ€™ earnings, the central bank said.  Remittances declined 3.5 percent from the previous quarter,
the bank said today in a report posted on its Facebook account
that was confirmed by Carlos Andrade, an economist at the
institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
