3 Degrees Asset Management, asked by
Singapore’s financial regulator to shutter its operations
following allegations that founder Moe Ibrahim diverted assets,
lost its legal bid to challenge the order.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore will work with 3
Degrees on the next steps for the withdrawal of its exempt fund
manager status, the regulator said today in an e-mailed response
to queries.  The Monetary Authority probed Singapore-based 3 Degrees
after one of its funds sued Indonesian-born Agus Anwar in 2008
to recover at least $40 million of debt. Anwar then claimed that
Ibrahim diverted $6.7 million from the fund to 3 Degrees, which
is wholly owned by Ibrahim. Withdrawing 3 Degrees’ exempt
status would send a “strong message of deterrence’ to others in
the industry, the regulator said in court papers earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
