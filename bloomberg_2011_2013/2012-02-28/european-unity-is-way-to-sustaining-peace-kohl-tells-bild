European leaders, struggling to
overcome the debt crisis, should draw inspiration from the
founding fathers of the European Union who championed unity
after two world wars, German ex-Chancellor  Helmut Kohl  said in
an interview with  Bild Zeitung .  “The visionaries of yesteryear were well aware of how
difficult it would be and how long it would take to turn the
European ideal into reality,” Kohl told the German newspaper.
“The founding fathers were one in thinking that only a united
 Europe  would offer the chance of sustaining peace and freedom.”  “The evil spirits of the past have in no way been banished
-- they can always come back,” Kohl said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
