Russian  foreign direct investment 
soared to $18.4 billion last year, a 33 percent increase from
2010, with finance and manufacturing receiving the most capital.  Total foreign investment, including loans and flows into
securities markets, surged 66 percent last year to $190.6
billion, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in
an e-mailed statement.  The Kremlin set up the Russian Direct Investment Fund to
co-finance international investment and in October won $1
billion in backing from Chinaâ€™s sovereign wealth fund, the first
foreign commitment to the private-equity vehicle. The government
expects inflows to reach between $60 billion and $70 billion
soon, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said last year.  The financial industry received the largest amount of
investments in 2011, attracting $86.9 billion, followed by
manufacturing and mining. Cyprus was the largest foreign
investor in the period, followed by the Netherlands, Luxembourg
and  Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
