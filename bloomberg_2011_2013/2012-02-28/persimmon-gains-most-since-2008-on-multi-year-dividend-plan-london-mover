Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.’s largest
homebuilder by market value, gained the most since October 2008
in  London  trading after announcing a plan to return 1.9 billion
pounds ($3 billion) to shareholders by 2021.  The shares rose as much as 20 percent, the most in the
Bloomberg EMEA Home Builders Index, which increased 5.2 percent
to the highest since September 2008.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , the
homebuilder that’s scheduled to report earnings tomorrow, had
the second-biggest gain.  “This return of cash should make Persimmon’s balance more
efficient and support a return to an acceptable level of return
on capital employed,” Jon Bell, a Shore Capital Group Ltd.
analyst with a “hold” recommendation on the stock, said in a
note to investors today.  Persimmon and  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG)  are the only U.K.
homebuilders to offer investors returns until 2021 as they seek
to minimize the size of their companies. Britain’s developers
abandoned high-volume homebuilding after the financial crisis
and focused on houses rather than apartments in urban areas to
increase margins.  Persimmon, based in York, England, was up 75.5 pence, or 12
percent, at 702.5 pence at 10:19 a.m., giving the homebuilder a
market value of 2.12 billion pounds. The shares, which are on
course to close at a record high, have climbed 64 percent in the
past six months, while the Home Builders Index has gained 48
percent.  The homebuilder will pay investors a total of 6.20 pounds a
share, starting with a 75 pence dividend in June 2013. The
dividend will be paid in a two-year cycle until 2019, giving
Persimmon flexibility to acquire land for development and
generate further profits, Chief Executive Officer Mike Farley
said on a conference call today.  ‘More Ambitious’  “The business will be in a larger and stronger place”
when the dividend plan winds up in 10 years,” Farley said on
the call today. “We intend to do this by the use of a zero-
geared balance sheet.”  Investors will receive their next dividend of 95 pence a
share on 30 June, 2015. That will be followed by payments of 110
pence in June 2017 and 2019. The final payments of 115 pence
will be made in each of the next two years, according to the
statement.  Berkeley, the U.K.’s second largest homebuilder by value,
said in June that it plans to return 1.7 billion pounds to
investors over the next decade.  Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) , the
U.K.’s largest homebuilder by volume, said last week that it
wouldn’t be appropriate for it to pay an interim dividend.  “This is more ambitious even than Berkeley Group’s
return,” Peel Hunt LLP analyst Robin Hardy said in a note.
“This approach to the cycle is generally what we have been
advocating, with resistance to a return to aggressive volume
growth, possible shrinking of the business scale and slimming
the capital base to improve returns.”  Profit Beats Estimates  Persimmon’s full-year net income dropped 5.5 percent to 109
million pounds, or 35.9 pence a share, the company said today.
Analysts expected earnings of 34 pence a share, the average of
five estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Homebuilders are widening their profit margins by focusing
more on house and developing low-cost land bought during the
recession that ended in 2009. The U.K.’s coalition government is
trying to spur construction after homebuilding in  England  and
 Wales  fell in 2010 to the lowest during peacetime since 1924.  To contact the reporter on this story:
