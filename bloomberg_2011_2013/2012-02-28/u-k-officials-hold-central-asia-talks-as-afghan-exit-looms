U.K. Defense Secretary Philip Hammond held talks with Kazakh leaders as the military prepares
for the withdrawal of personnel and equipment from  Afghanistan 
by the end of 2014 along a northern route through central  Asia .  Hammond and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev began
negotiating a land-transit agreement in  Kazakhstan , the British
Defense Ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. He’ll move
on to Uzbekistan today as officials plan visits to Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.  “It’s vital that we secure the supply lines we need to get
our equipment home as combat operations finish,” Hammond said
in the statement. The logistics operation will involve removing
some 11,000 containers and 3,000 armored vehicles.  The visit came amid unrest in Afghanistan directed at U.S.
and NATO troops this month following the burning of the Koran
and other books by military personnel at Bagram air base,
prompting an apology by President  Barack Obama .  The U.K. has 9,500 troops in Afghanistan fighting under the
command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the second-
largest contingent behind the U.S. NATO member states aim to
hand over security in Afghanistan by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
