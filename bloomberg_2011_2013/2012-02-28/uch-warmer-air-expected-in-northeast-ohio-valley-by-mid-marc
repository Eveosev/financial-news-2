The U.S. Northeast and  Ohio  Valley
may become much warmer than normal by the second week of March,
forecasters said.  Temperatures may rise 8 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 to
7.8 Celsius) above normal from Ohio to New England, including
New York and Washington, March 9 through March 13, according to
an 11- to 15-day forecast from  MDA EarthSat Weather  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland.  “An already very warm map has turned even warmer in this
time frame,” MDA said.  Traders watch temperature predictions to gauge energy use
and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas
for heating, according to the Energy Department.  In the shorter term, forecasters are split on how warm the
East Coast will be next week.  The region may be 2 degrees cooler than normal in most
areas from March 5 to 9, while the Great Plains warm up, said
 David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  Commodity Weather Group LLC President  Matt Rogers  predicts
the warmer air will shift farther to the east. Southern New
England and the mid-Atlantic states may be about 3 degrees above
normal from March 4 to March 8, according to Rogers, who is
based in Bethesda, Maryland.  The normal average temperature in New York for March 7 is
about 40 degrees, according to MDA. It’s 36 in Boston, 41 in
Philadelphia, 35 in Chicago, 43 in  St. Louis , 56 in Dallas, 61
in Houston, 52 in Atlanta, 45 in Seattle and 58 in Burbank,
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
