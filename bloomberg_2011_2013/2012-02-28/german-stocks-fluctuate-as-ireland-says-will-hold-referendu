German stocks swung between gains
and losses after Ireland’s Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  said the
country will hold a referendum to ratify the European fiscal
compact.  Germany ’s benchmark DAX Index rose less than 0.4 percent to
6,852.01 at 4:21 p.m. in Frankfurt having risen as much as 0.7
percent and fallen as much as 0.6 percent earlier.  Kenny, speaking in the Dublin parliament, said the Irish
government decided to hold a vote after receiving legal advice
from the state’s attorney general. The government will finalize
arrangements for the vote in coming weeks, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
