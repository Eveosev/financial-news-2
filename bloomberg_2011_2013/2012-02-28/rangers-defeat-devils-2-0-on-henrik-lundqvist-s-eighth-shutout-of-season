Henrik Lundqvist  made 13 saves for
his league-leading eighth shutout of the season, and the 43rd of
his career, as the New York Rangers defeated the visiting New
Jersey Devils 2-0 in the National Hockey League.  Carl Hagelin scored with three minutes left in the first
period and Ryan Callahan added an empty-net goal with 66 seconds
remaining in the third for the Rangers (40-15-6), who lead the
Eastern Conference by nine points.  The Rangers have 86 points, second in the NHL to
Vancouver’s 87. The Boston Bruins and  Pittsburgh Penguins  are
tied for second in the East with 77 points.  New Jersey (35-23-4) had a seven-game road winning streak
snapped in the game last night at Madison Square Garden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
