Nigeria ,  Africa ’s most populous
nation, plans to fight terrorism it faces in parts of the north
by creating jobs, Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said.  “We are very worried about  job creation ,” Okonjo-Iweala
said today at a conference in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial
capital. The country’s 23 percent unemployment rate “is a worry
for us,” said Okonjo-Iweala, a former World Bank managing
director.  Authorities in Africa’s largest oil producer blame Boko
Haram, which calls for the imposition of Shariah law, for bomb
and gun attacks in northern Nigeria since 2009. Boko Haram,
whose name means “Western education is a sin,” claimed
responsibility for multiple blasts and attacks in the city of
Kano on Jan. 20 that killed at least 256 people, according to
the Civil Rights Congress.  The number of Nigerians living on less than a dollar a day
rose to 61.2 percent in 2010, from 51.6 percent in 2004, the
National Bureau of Statistics said in a report released on Feb.
