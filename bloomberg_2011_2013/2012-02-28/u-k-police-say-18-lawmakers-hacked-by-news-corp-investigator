The private investigator jailed in
2007 for hacking phones for  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s now defunct News of the
World tabloid targeted at least 18 lawmakers, police said.  Fifty-four lawmakers, 44 of them current or former members
of the House of Commons and 10 from the House of Lords, have
been identified as mentioned in Glenn Mulcaire’s notes so far,
Metropolitan Police Service Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue
Akers said in a letter to Parliament’s Culture Committee
published today.  Of these, 14 members of the Commons and four members of the
Lords have been identified as likely hacking victims. All have
been notified, Akers said. She said it was possible that her
officers will identify more victims as they go through
Mulcaire’s notes.  In a separate letter to the committee, also published
today,  James Murdoch , News Corp.’s deputy chief operating
officer, set out new measures the company is taking to improve
corporate governance.  He said all staff have been issued with a code of conduct,
and so far 330 have been through training on bribery. Akers
yesterday told an inquiry into media ethics that News Corp.’s
Sun newspaper had maintained a network of corrupt public
officials to supply stories, spending hundreds of thousands of
pounds in bribes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
