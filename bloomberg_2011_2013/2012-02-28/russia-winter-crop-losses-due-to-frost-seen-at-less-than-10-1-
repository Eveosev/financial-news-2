Russia  will lose less than 10
percent of its winter crops, said Anna Strashnaya, head of the
agricultural forecasts department at the Federal
Hydrometeorological Center.  Frosts affected small areas in parts of Krasnodar, Rostov
and Stavropol regions in Russia’s south, as well as some fields
in the southwest’s Black Earth area and in the southeast’s Volga
region, Strashnaya said by phone from Moscow today.  Russia has sown 16.5 million hectares of its 2012 winter
plantings, 16.1 million hectares (39.8 million acres) of which
are grain, according to the agriculture ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
