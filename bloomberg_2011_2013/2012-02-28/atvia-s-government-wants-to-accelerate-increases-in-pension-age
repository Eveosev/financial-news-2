Latvia’s government wants to begin
raising the Baltic country’s pension age two years earlier than
planned, as a shrinking population weighs on public finances.  The current age of 62 would start to increase in 2014
rather than 2016, pending approval by parliament, Prime Minister
Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference today in the capital,
Riga. Plans to raise it to 65 by 2020 remain in place, he added.  Demographic issues have “introduced corrections to the
calculations for the social system’s sustainability,” while 20
million lati ($38.5 million) in early-retirement costs have been
incurred, Dombrovskis said. Latvia’s population shrank to about
2.1 million in 2011 from 2.4 million in 2000,  census  data show.  Latvian courts overturned a government bid to cut pensions
in 2009 after the end of a real-estate bubble and the withdrawal
of foreign credit triggered a recession, forcing the country to
seek a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.1 billion) bailout. Increasing the
pension age before January 2015 will prompt more people to
retire early, which risks “destabilizing the social-insurance
budget,” the  World Bank   said  in 2010.  Latvia raised pension allowances too quickly when its
economy was growing from 2000 to 2008 and should seek to recover
some of those gains, the World Bank recommended at that time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
