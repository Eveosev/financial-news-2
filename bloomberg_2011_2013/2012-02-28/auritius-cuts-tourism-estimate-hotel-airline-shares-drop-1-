Mauritius cut its forecast for
tourism arrivals this year, sending hotel and airline shares
down, as the debt crisis in  Europe  curbs demand.  The estimate was reduced to 980,000 from 1.01 million, the
Port Louis-based official statistics agency  said  on its website
today. The country attracted 964,642 visitors in 2011.  Tourism and textiles are the main sources of foreign
currency for the Indian Ocean island nation, and almost two-
thirds of visitors last year came from Europe. The European
Commission forecasts a 0.3 percent contraction in the Eurozone’s
economy this year. Visitor numbers declined from a year earlier
in December and January, two of Mauritius’s peak tourism months.  “We shouldn’t be over-optimistic, taking into account the
economic downturn in Europe,” Swadicq Nuthay, an economist at
Axys Capital Management Ltd in  Port Louis , which oversees assets
of 5 billion rupees ($173 million), said in a phone interview.
“The industry, unfortunately, hasn’t been proactive enough in
its market diversification strategy.”  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMHMP) , the country’s largest leisure
operator by market value, dropped 2.1 percent to 70 rupees, the
lowest since March 2009.  Sun Resorts Ltd. (SUN) , the second-largest
resort group, fell 1.2 percent to 41 rupees.  Lux Island Resorts
Ltd. (NRL)  retreated 1.4 percent to 21.90 rupees, its lowest level
since Dec. 21.  Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan  Africa ’s fourth
biggest airline, retreated 0.8 percent to 12 rupees.  “The mood has been negative for a while,” said Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at Axys Stockbroking Ltd. “It was an
expected downward revision which should have already been
factored in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
