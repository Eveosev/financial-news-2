Romania  will increase its wind power
capacity to 1,400 megawatts by the end of this year as the
country seeks to raise electricity output from renewable energy
sources.  Power produced by wind parks will increase from the current
800 megawatts, Environment Minister Laszlo Borbely said at a
conference in Bucharest today. Romania has the potential to
produce about 1,100 megawatts of power from micro-hydro plants
and plans to raise their installed output capacity to around 400
megawatts by the end of the year from 300 megawatts now, he
said.  The country approved a plan to support investments in green
energy by granting so-called “green certificates” as it seeks
to produce 24 percent of its energy from renewable sources by
2020. Each megawatt-hour of electricity produced from wind gets
two green certificates, while a megawatt-hour produced by a new
hydro-power plant gets three certificates.  The value of a green certificate varies between 28 euros
($38) and 57 euros, Borbely said.  Companies operating wind farms in Romania include  CEZ SA (CEZ) 
and  Enel Green Power Spa. (EGPW)   To contact the reporter on this story:
