Kansas City (9577MF) ,  Missouri , had the
outlook for its AA credit grade revised to negative from stable
by  Fitch Ratings  on concern that the city may borrow too much
and that it hasn’t planned to increase pension funding.  “The additional debt layered on the already elevated debt
burden may strain available resources,” James Mann, a Fitch
senior director in  New York , said today in a report, citing
costs related to light rail and neighborhood revitalization
projects. The city plans to spend $100 million on the transit
system and to borrow $100 million a year through the next decade
for rehabilitation work, according to Mann.  Fitch rates $310.5 million of general-obligation bonds
third-highest at AA, and assigned that grade to $217.4 million
in debt to be issued next week. It gave an A+ rating, two steps
lower, to $76 million in special-obligation improvement and
refunding securities, also set for sale next week. It also
grades an additional $1.12 billion in city debt A+.  The city hasn’t fully funded its annual pension costs in at
least six years, Mann said in the report. It ended the past
fiscal year with a $5.7 million general-fund surplus after
failing to put $32.5 million into pension funds for municipal
employees. With a jobless rate of 8.3 percent as of December,
the city anticipates a $15 million deficit this year, prompting
a freeze on hiring and cuts in  capital spending , Mann said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
