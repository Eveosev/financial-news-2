(Corrects description of product in second paragraph.)  Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558) ’s complaint
against  American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC)  claiming it was sold
substandard parts will be heard by the Beijing Arbitration
Committee.  Sinovel,  China ’s largest wind-turbine maker, is seeking 105
million yuan ($17 million) plus fees for eight turbine-control
units delivered in 2008 that it claims were substandard, the
Beijing-based company said in a filing with the  Shanghai Stock
Exchange  today.  The company said profits may be reduced as a result of the
arbitration case.  American Superconductor is suing Sinovel in Chinese courts,
seeking more than $1.2 billion in damages for allegedly
violating sales contracts and stealing intellectual property.
Before the suit, Sinovel was the Devens, Massachusetts-based
company’s largest customer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
