Computer and financial companies,
which have led gains in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  this
year, are showing opposite trends in their charts relative to
the overall market, according to Bank of America Corp.  A 15 percent rally this year brought the  S&P 500 
Information Technology Index’s price ratio compared with the
full index close to the highest level since 2001, while the
financials gauge remains stuck in a two-year downtrend after a
14 percent gain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
Bank of America.  “Technology is entering a secular  bull market ,” Mary Ann Bartels, New York-based head of U.S. technical and market
analysis at Bank of America, wrote in a note dated yesterday.
“Financials remain in a secular bear market that can last
several more years,” she said. “The current pattern is a
tactical rally within this  bear market .”  The two biggest industry groups have risen more than the
overall S&P 500 this year as investors shifted focus to
companies most-tied to economic growth, encouraged by better-
than-estimated earnings and data on housing and the labor
market. The technology index climbed to the highest level since
February 2001 yesterday, while the financials measure gained 0.9
percent and is near its highest point since July.  Computer and financial shares shared the same pattern
during their plunges from peaks. The technology index’s price
ratio to the S&P 500 fell 66 percent to 0.22 from 2000 to 2002,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The housing boom and
bust prompted the same magnitude of drop in financials’
performance relative to the full index. Their ratio fell 66
percent from 2006 to 0.12 in 2009, the data show.  The rally in computer stocks this year marked the
completion of “a big base,” Bartels said. “Similar to
technology coming off the 2002 low, time and patience are
required for the financials.”  The technology index’s price ratio to the S&P 500 reached
0.34 yesterday, according to Bloomberg data. Financials’
relative performance ratio was 0.15, compared with its October
2009 peak of 0.19, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
