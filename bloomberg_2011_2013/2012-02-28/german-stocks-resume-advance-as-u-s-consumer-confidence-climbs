German stocks resumed an advance
after U.S. data showed confidence among consumers rose in
February to the highest level in a year.  The benchmark DAX Index climbed 0.4 percent to 6,873.34 at
4:02 p.m. in  Frankfurt , erasing an earlier loss of as much as
0.6 percent.  The Conference Boardâ€™s confidence index increased to 70.8
from a revised 61.5 in January, figures from the New York-based
private research group showed today. Economists predicted the
gauge would climb to 63, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
