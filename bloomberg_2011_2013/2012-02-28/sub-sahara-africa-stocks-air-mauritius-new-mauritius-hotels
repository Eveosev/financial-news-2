Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index (SEMDEX)  fell for a
sixth day, declining 0.8 percent to 1,784.22 by the end of
trading, the lowest since October 2010.  Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  advanced for the sixth straight
day, gaining 1 percent to 57.89 in Nairobi, the highest since
Sept. 28. The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index (NGSEINDX)  fell for a
second day, retreating 1.1 percent to 20,137.50 at 2:30 p.m. in
Lagos, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  FTSE/Namibia
Overall Index (FTN098)  jumped 1 percent to 920.83 as of in Windhoek.  The following shares were active in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding  South Africa . Stock symbols are in parentheses.  GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria Plc (GLAXOSMI)  , a local
unit of the U.K.’s biggest drugmaker, dropped 5 percent to 20.90
naira, the lowest since April 2010, after the company’s dividend
announcement of 1.20 naira per share for the full-year 2011 fell
below investors’ expectations.  The dividend “is too small for a 21-naira stock,” Raheem
Mohammed, chief operating officer of Lagos-based Kundila
Finance, a brokerage, said by phone today. “Investors want
stocks on which they can get both dividends and capital
appreciation,” he said.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH)  , the country’s largest
leisure operator by market value, dropped 2.1 percent to 70
rupees, the lowest since March 2009. Mauritius cut its forecast
for tourism arrivals this year, sending hotel and airline shares
down, as the debt crisis in Europe curbs demand.  Sun Resorts Ltd. (SUN)  (SUN MP), the second-largest resort group,
fell 1.2 to 41 rupees.  Lux Island Resorts Ltd. (NRL)  
retreated 1.4 percent to 21.90 rupees, its lowest level since
December 2010.  Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML)  , sub-Saharan Africa’s
fourth biggest airline, retreated 0.8 percent to 12 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
