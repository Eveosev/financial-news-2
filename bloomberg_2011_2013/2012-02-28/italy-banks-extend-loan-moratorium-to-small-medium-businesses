The  Italian Banking Association  
agreed to extend a moratorium on loan payments by small and
medium-size companies as they cope with the country’s fourth
recession since 2001.  The agreement with the government was signed in  Rome  today,
the association known as ABI said in a statement on its website.
The moratorium, begun in August 2009, allowed 260,000 companies
to keep 15 billion euros ($20.2 billion) of “liquidity at the
disposal of the real economy,” ABI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
