GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria
Plc (GLAXOSMI) , the local unit of the U.K.’s biggest drugmaker, headed for
its lowest level in 22 months after the company’s dividend
announcement fell below investors’ expectations.  The stock dropped 5 percent to 20.90 naira at 14.31 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital, on course for its lowest since
April 2010. The shares have declined 9 percent this year,
compared with a 3 percent retreat in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange 
All-Share Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  GlaxoSmithKline will pay a 1.20-naira per share dividend
for the 2011 full-year, the company said in a statement
published on the website of the Nigerian Stock Exchange today.  The dividend “is too small for a 21-naira stock,” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Lagos-based Kundila
Finance, a brokerage, said by phone today. “Investors want
stocks on which they can get both dividends and capital
appreciation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
