(Corrects currency conversion of story published Feb. 28.)  BR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3) ,  Brazil ’s
biggest owner of shopping malls, said net income rose 56 percent
in the fourth quarter, missing analyst estimates, as
acquisitions boosted sales.  Net income was 90.6 million reais ($49 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31, compared with 58 million reais a
year earlier, according to a regulatory filing. The result
compares with an average  estimate  for adjusted net income of 106
million reais among four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net
revenue jumped 42 percent to 264 million reais in the quarter.  The results “reflect the very positive operating
environment the shopping mall industry is facing currently,”
analysts David Lawant, Enrico Trotta and Vivian Salomon from
Banco Itau BBA SA wrote in a report distributed to clients
today. The wholesale unit of Itau Unibanco Holding SA maintained
its “outperform” rating on the stock with a fair value of
26.20 per share.  BR Malls bought four shopping malls in the three months
ended Dec. 31, including Shopping Jardim Sul in  Sao Paulo  for
460 million reais, and increased its participation in three
other malls. At the end of 2011, the company held stakes in 45
shopping centers, of which 10 are wholly-owned.  Same-store sales increased 8.8 percent in the quarter,
while total sales rose 19 percent to 5.3 billion reais.  BR Malls  fell  1.75 percent to 21.28 reais at 1:29 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. The stock has gained 19.5 percent this year through
yesterday, while the benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 15
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
