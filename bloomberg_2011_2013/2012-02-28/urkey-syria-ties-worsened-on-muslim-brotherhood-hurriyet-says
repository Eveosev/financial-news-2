Turkey  and Syria’s relationship
deteriorated because President Bashar al-Assad didn’t allow the
Muslim Brotherhood to establish a political party, Syrian
Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem told Hurriyet newspaper.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  reversed a decade of
improving ties after Assad stopped short of the Turkish leader’s
repeated requests to allow the Brotherhood to organize in the
country, Muallem told the Istanbul-based newspaper in an
interview in Damascus. Syria would only agree to let formerly
banished members of the group return to start a dialog, he said.  Syria was “a little late” in enacting reforms, yet the
process will move at the country’s own pace and not at the
behest of the international community, Muallem said, according
to Hurriyet. He advised his counterpart,  Ahmet Davutoglu , to
review Turkey’s policies and “not lose Syria forever,”
Hurriyet reported.  Assad’s government “wants this violence to stop
tomorrow,” Muallem told Hurriyet, adding that while Syria
doesn’t anticipate a foreign military intervention, the
government is ready to defend the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
