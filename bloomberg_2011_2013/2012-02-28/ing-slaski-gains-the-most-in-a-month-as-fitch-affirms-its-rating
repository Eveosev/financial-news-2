ING Bank Slaski SA (BSK)  jumped the most
in almost a month after Fitch Ratings affirmed the Polish unit
of ING Bank NV at an ‘A’ rating with a stable outlook.  The shares rose as much as 2.7 percent to 87.5 zloty, the
most since Jan. 31 on an intraday basis, and traded 1.6 percent
higher to 86.55 zloty as of 12:47 p.m. in Warsaw.  “ING Bank Slaski’s Long- and Short-term Issuer Default
Ratings are based on the potential support that it can expect to
receive from its parent, ING Bank NV, if needed,” Fitch said in
a statement published today.  ING Bank has an A+ rating from Fitch with a stable outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
