Holcim Ecuador SA (HOL) , a unit of the
world’s second-largest cement producer, said shareholders
approved a $99.1 million cash dividend, or $4.84 per share, from
2011 and 2010 earnings.  The Guayaquil-based company, which has already paid out
about $40 million of the dividend to shareholders, will
distribute the remainder of the payment beginning in March, the
company said in a statement published today on the Quito
securities exchange’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
