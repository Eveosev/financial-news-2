Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI)  said
a German appeals court that granted  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  a temporary
ruling blocking the enforcement of a patent verdict shows that
inventors should be paid for their innovations.  “Motorola Mobility’s determination to collect fair
compensation for Apple’s use of patented technology has been
vindicated by” the court, Motorola Mobility said in an e-mailed
statement.  Apple yesterday won the German appeals court ruling at the
Higher Regional Court of Karlsruhe,  Germany . Motorola Mobility,
which forced Apple to remove some iPad and iPhone models from
its German online store for a short period, can’t enforce the
verdict during an appeal, the court said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
