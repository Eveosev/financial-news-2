CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  climbed the most in
four weeks after the U.S.-listed Russian television channel
owner signaled it may seek to bolster advertising revenue by
buying stations in neighboring Ukraine and Belarus.  CTC Media, whose main television channel is the fourth
most-watched in Russia, gained as much as 6.5 percent yesterday
after interim Chief Executive Officer Boris Podolsky said in an
interview that the company may spend $500 million to $600
million on acquisitions in 2012 and has sold about 80 percent of
its advertising capacity for the year.  Futures (VEH2)  expiring in March
on Russia’s dollar-denominated  RTS  index added 0.9 percent to
172,150 in U.S. trading.  The Moscow-based company is seeking to revive its
advertising fortunes as it seeks to become  Russia ’s third-
biggest channel while its audience share stalls. CTC reported a
fourth-quarter net loss yesterday of $25.5 million, from a
profit of $75.3 million a year earlier as it paid a $17.9
million impairment charge. Stock in the company, which is also
paying a smaller-than-expected dividend, slumped 63 percent last
year as CEO Anton Kudryashov stepped down.  “We are planning some regional purchases in Russia and
looking at neighboring countries, such as Ukraine and Belarus,”
Podolsky, who is also CTC’s chief financial officer, said by
phone from Moscow yesterday. “It’s possible that we can buy a
TV channel in Russia, or a TV production company.”  CTC  stock  jumped 5 percent to $10.54 in  New York  yesterday,
the biggest advance since Feb. 1, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The company was the biggest gainer on the  Bloomberg
Russia-US 14 Index (RUSN14BN)  of Russian companies traded in New York,
which was little changed at 113.54.  ‘Different’ Vision  CTC, which has no outstanding debt, may sell Eurobonds,
including ruble-denominated notes, or negotiate syndicated loans
to finance acquisitions within or outside of Russia, Podolsky
said. The company has no interest in assets in other former
Soviet states except for Ukraine and Belarus, he said.  The suggestion of asset purchases sets a different tone for
CTC, said Svetlana Sukhanova, an analyst at UBS AG in Moscow.  “It’s different from the vision of the previous leadership
of the company, which was interested in only a license for
broadcasting in Ukraine,” Sukhanova said by phone yesterday.
“When we hear about a $500 million to $600 million potential
purchase, it signals a big asset and not just a license.”  UBS rates CTC Media a “buy” with a 12-month price target
of $16 a share, according to client note released yesterday.  Ad Sales ‘Relief’  Podolsky became interim CEO after the company lost
Kudryashov to mobile-phone provider  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  in December.
CTC is interested in new media and Internet assets as that is
where growth in advertising is the greatest, he said. Internet
ad spending climbed the most of all advertising in Russia last
year, expanding 56 percent, according to the Association of
Communication Agencies of Russia.  “It’s a relief that they have sold 80 percent of their
2012 advertising inventories, because there had been some
concerns that their ad contracts were delayed,” Iouli Matevossov a senior analyst at  Alfa Bank  in Moscow said by
phone. He rates the stock “overweight” with a target price at
$17 per share.  CTC’s average daily share of television viewers of four
years and older rose to 7.7 percent in the week to Feb. 19, from
7.3 percent the week earlier, according to data released by  TNS-
Global  on Feb. 27.  Renaissance Capital  reiterated its “buy”
recommendation on the stock yesterday.  Russia ETF Drops  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell 0.3 percent to $33.21 yesterday. The
fund has gained 25 percent this year, compared with a 7.5
percent advance in the same period a year ago. The  RTS
Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in the index
futures, declined 0.7 percent to 32.35 yesterday.  Oil futures rose today after falling for a second day
yesterday. Crude oil for April delivery gained 0.3 percent to

barrel yesterday on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Brent oil
for April settlement dropped 2.1 percent to $121.55 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange. Urals crude, Russia’s chief
export blend, dropped 1.8 percent to $120.39.  American depositary receipts of OAO Lukoil, Russia’s
biggest independent crude producer, fell 0.5 percent to $63.52
in New York yesterday, boosting the  premium  over its shares
traded on Moscow’s  Micex (INDEXCF)  to 0.5 percent, the most since Feb. 16.
 Lukoil (LKOH)  fell 1.8 percent to 1,833.40 rubles, or $63.29, on the
Micex yesterday.  Bull Market  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,

today after data showed factory output in  Japan  and  South Korea 
gained. The MSCI gauge has risen 20 percent from its low on Oct.
5, meeting the definition of a  bull market .  The 30-stock Micex slipped 1.2 percent to 1,574.10 in
Moscow yesterday, the biggest drop since Feb. 22 and reducing
its gain this month to 4 percent. The RTS slid 1.2 percent to
1,708.16.  The Micex has strengthened 12 percent in 2012 and trades at
