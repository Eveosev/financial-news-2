JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said investment banking and
trading will recover from the slump that occurred at the end of
last year.  “Is the downturn you saw in the fourth quarter cyclical or
secular?” Dimon said today at a presentation in New York, where
the bank is based. “We’re telling you it is cyclical. I’m not
hedging that, OK. It is cyclical.”  The industry’s revenue from trading stocks and fixed-income
products dropped 10 percent last year, according to a
 presentation  from the company. Trading volume and underwriting
activity fell in the second half amid concern that the European
debt crisis would cause a global economic slowdown.  JPMorgan’s investment bank had a 17 percent return on
equity last year, unchanged from 2010, according to the
presentation. Its peers’ average ROE, a measure of
profitability, dropped to 8 percent from 14 percent, the bank
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
