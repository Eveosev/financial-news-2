The former treasurer of  Detroit  was
charged by the U.S. with taking bribes and kickbacks in exchange
for approving investments for city pension funds.  Jeffrey Beasley, 43, was charged with six counts in an
indictment unsealed today in connection with $200 million in
investments in two pension funds, U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade
said in a statement.  Beasley, who was a member of the boards of trustees for the
two funds, conspired with others from 2006 to 2008 to accept
bribes in the form of cash, travel, meals,  golf clubs , gambling
money, Las Vegas concert tickets and private-plane flights,
according to the release. The funds lost more than $84 million
from investments associated with Beasley’s conspiracy,
prosecutors said.  “Employees of the city of Detroit are entitled to honest
services from the trustees of their pension funds,” McQuade
said in the release.  Beasley faces a prison sentence of more than 20 years on
each of the six counts of extortion, conspiracy and  wire fraud ,
according to the statement. He might be fined $250,000 for each
count and forfeit more than $225,000 in unlawful payments,
according to the statement.  Walter J. Piszczatowski, Beasley’s lawyer, didn’t
immediately reply to messages seeking comment on the charges.  Demand for $250,000  Beasley, at a Detroit restaurant in 2007, demanded $250,000
from the owner of an unidentified company to win the pension
boards’ support for the company’s proposal to obtain $44 million
in financing from the funds, according to the indictment.  Beasley was appointed treasurer by Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick,
who was indicted by the U.S. in 2010 on charges including
bribery, extortion and fraud.  Kilpatrick’s trial is scheduled for September. Beasley left
his position as treasurer in 2008, after Kilpatrick’s
resignation.  The case is U.S. v. Beasley, 2:12-cr-20030, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of  Michigan  (Detroit).  To contact the reporter on this story:
