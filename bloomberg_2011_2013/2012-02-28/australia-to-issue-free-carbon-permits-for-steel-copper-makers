Australia ’s producers of steel,
aluminum and copper are among high greenhouse gas emitters that
will receive free carbon permits for an anti-pollution tax that
begins July 1,  Climate Change Minister  Greg Combet  said.  Under the law, which sets up an emissions trading system,
the government will charge about 500 polluters A$23 ($24.80) a
ton for discharges. The imposed price will give way in 2015 to a
cap-and-trade system that allows companies which keep emissions
below their limit to sell permits to other polluters.  “The most emissions-intensive industries will receive an
initial average of 94.5 percent of their carbon permits for
free,” Combet said in a statement today. “That means the
effective average carbon price in these industries is reduced
from A$23 to only A$1.30 a ton.”  Other industries to receive the free permits are aluminum
production, petroleum refining, flat-glass manufacturing, pulp
and paper making and zinc refining, according to the statement.
The 94.5 percent rate is for the first year, after which the
rate will be reduced by 1.3 percent a year, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
