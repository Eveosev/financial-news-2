The Slovenian stretch of the South
Stream natural gas pipeline will cost about 1 billion euros
($1.34 billion),  Delo newspaper  reported, citing Marjan Eberlinc, the chief of Plinovodi d.o.o  after his meeting with
Alexey Miller, the CEO of OAO Gazprom in the capital Ljubljana.  Slovenia and the Russia’s gas export monopoly have agreed
to share the cost by forming a joint company that is set to
start building the pipeline by the end of the year, the
Ljubljana-based newspaper said.  The Slovenian section of the South Stream will initially be
able to carry 8 billion cubic meters of gas a year, which will
later increase to 25 billion, according to Delo.  The South Stream project, which involves the Italian
company  ENI SpA (ENI) , would build a pipeline across the  Black Sea  to
ship Russian gas to  Europe , bypassing transit countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
