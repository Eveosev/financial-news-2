The  New York Jets  have given
linebacker Bart Scott permission to seek a trade with three
years remaining on his six-year, $48 million contract, the New
York  Daily News reported , without saying where it got the
information.  Scott, 31, was frustrated with his decreased playing time
last season, the Daily News said. He was fined $10,000 by the
 National Football League  for making an obscene gesture to a
member of the media the day after the Jets’ season-ending loss
in Miami that kept them out of the postseason.  The Jets signed Scott as a free agent in 2009, reuniting
him with coach  Rex Ryan , who had been his defensive coordinator
in Baltimore. Scott restructured his contract before the 2011
season, taking a pay cut in return for a 2012 base salary of
$4.2 million that’s fully guaranteed, the Daily News said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
