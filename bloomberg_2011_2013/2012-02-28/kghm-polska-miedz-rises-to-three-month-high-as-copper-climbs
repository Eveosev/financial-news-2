KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper
producer with the biggest European mine output, jumped to a
three-month high as the price of the metal gained.  The stock climbed as much as 1.7 percent to 145.4 zloty,
the highest since Nov. 18, and traded 1.5 percent higher at
145.1 zloty at 11:55 a.m. in Warsaw. The shares have rallied 31
percent this year, the biggest gain in the benchmark WIG20
Index, which increased 0.3 percent today.  Copper for three-month delivery advanced as much as 0.7
percent in  London  to $8,595.75 a metric ton, the highest level
since Feb. 10. A gauge of consumer sentiment in  Germany  will
reach a 12-month high in March, market research company GfK SE
said. A report today may show U.S. consumer confidence rose this
month, according to economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
