PT Bank Tabungan Negara,  Indonesia ’s
largest mortgage lender, said 2011 profit rose 22 percent from a
year earlier as lending increased.  Net income rose to 1.119 trillion rupiah ($123 million)
from 916 billion rupiah a year earlier, the lender said in a
statement in Jakarta today. The median estimate of 13 analysts
in a Bloomberg surveyed was 1.01 trillion rupiah.  Gross domestic product  in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy
expanded 6.46 percent last year, the fastest pace since before
the Asian Financial crisis, benefitting lenders including  Bank
Negara  as consumers borrowed more to finance homes, vehicles and
appliances. The central bank has cut its benchmark  interest rate 
to a record low 5.75 percent since October to help boost
consumption, which accounts for more than half of GDP.  “We are optimistic that loans will grow above 25
percent,” President Director Iqbal Latanro said in Jakarta
today.  Net interest income, or revenue from borrowers after
deducting interest paid to depositors, rose 12.79 percent to
3.788 trillion from 3.358 trillion rupiah a year earlier.
Lending grew 23.31 percent to 63.6 trillion rupiah from 51.5
trillion rupiah a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
