German  consumer confidence  will
increase to a 12-month high in March as falling unemployment and
slowing inflation boost income expectations,  GfK SE (GFK)  said.  The Nuremberg-based market research company forecast today
that its consumer-sentiment index, based on a survey of about
2,000 people, will rise to 6 from 5.9 this month. That would be
the highest since March last year and match the median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey of 23 economists.  Unemployment in Europe’s largest economy is at a two-decade
low of 6.7 percent, supporting  consumer spending  and helping to
limit the impact of the sovereign debt crisis.  Business
confidence (GRIFPBUS)  is at a seven-month high and  Germany ’s Bundesbank
said on Feb. 20 that the outlook for the economy has “improved
perceptibly,” even though risks remain.  While the impact of  Europe ’s turmoil may make for a
“bumpy” recovery and drag on exports, the “incredibly
favorable labor market in Germany has boosted expectations for
higher wages,” GfK said in the statement. Furthermore, the
inflation rate is expected to fall below 2 percent this year, it
said.  GfK’s index of income expectations jumped to 41.3 in
February, the highest since June, from 34.1 in January. A gauge
of economic optimism fell to 5.9 from 7.5, while a measure of
consumers’ willingness to spend slipped to 39.2 from 41.8.  The Bundesbank forecasts economic growth will slow to 0.6
percent this year from 3 percent in 2011 before accelerating to
1.8 percent in 2013.  Puma SE, Europe’s second-largest sporting-goods maker, on
Feb. 15 forecast earnings will grow this year and next after
posting a 2011 profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
