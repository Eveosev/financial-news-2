Klubradio, an opposition Hungarian
radio station which is appealing the loss of its frequency,
should have been assigned a frequency it was awarded in 2010,
Nepszabadsag  reported , citing a first-instance court ruling.  The Media Council, which was set up after Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban  won elections in 2010 and is the successor to the
former media regulator, should have signed a contract for the
92.9 MHz frequency, the newspaper reported, citing a ruling
today by the Budapest Metropolitan Court. The parties have 15
days to appeal the decision, Nepszabadsag said.  The court ruling establishes Klubradio’s contract for the
92.9 MHz frequency, the newspaper said. Klubradio meanwhile is
appealing the Media Council’s decision to award its current 95.3
MHz frequency to another bidder, the daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
