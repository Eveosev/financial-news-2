France ’s Nicolas Sarkozy narrowed
his gap with Socialist opponent  Francois Hollande  a week after
kicking off his presidential election campaign, a poll showed.  With less than two months before the ballot, Sarkozy lags
behind Hollande by 4.5 points in voting intentions, down from a
seven-point gap a week earlier, according to an  Ipsos SA poll 
for Le Monde and France Televisions published today.  The survey is the latest to show Sarkozy picking up
support, particularly in the first leg of the two-round contest,
while still trailing the leading candidate for the second ballot
by more than any other sitting president under France’s current
constitution. France’s presidential elections will be held on
April 22 and May 6.  Sarkozy now has the support of about 27 percent of voters
for the first round, compared with about 31.5 percent for
Hollande, according to Ipsos. For the second round, about 42
percent of voters back him, against 58 percent for Hollande.  Ipsos interviewed 959 voters by telephone on Feb. 24 and
25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
