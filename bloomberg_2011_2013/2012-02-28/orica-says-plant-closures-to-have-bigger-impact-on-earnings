Orica Ltd. (ORI) , the worldâ€™s largest
industrial explosives maker, said the shutdowns at its Kooragang
Island plant may cost 80 percent more than estimated because of
restart delays.  The closures of ammonia and ammonium nitrate facilities are
estimated to have cut A$90 million ($97 million) from earnings
before interest and tax, the Melbourne-based company said today
in a statement. That compares with its Dec. 15 estimate of as
much as A$50 million. Orica still expects to post higher net
income for the year ending Sept. 30, it said.  Orica resumed ammonia production this week, Nicole Ekert, a
company spokeswoman, said by phone today. The company shut the
ammonia plant in August following a chemical leak. Output of
ammonium nitrate resumed in December after the plant was halted
following a vapor release in November. The stock gained 0.5
percent to A$26.55 at 10:06 a.m. in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
