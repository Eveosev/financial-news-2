Options (SODA)  traders are boosting bets by
the most in 10 months that SodaStream International Ltd. will
extend gains as analysts predict the maker of soda machines will
report a 21 percent jump in fourth-quarter net income.  The ratio of outstanding calls to buy versus puts to sell
rose to 1.89-to-1, the most since April 25, and up from 1.12-to-
1 last month. Shares of the Airport City, Israel-based company
climbed 5.4 percent yesterday to $47.50, the highest level since
Aug. 15. The  Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest Israeli
U.S.-listed companies fell 0.2 percent to 85.69, led by  Alon
Holdings Blue Square-Israel Ltd. (BSI)   SodaStream will probably report today that  adjusted net
income  surged to 4.23 million euros ($5.69 million) in the
fourth quarter, up from 3.48 million euros in the same period
last year, according to the median estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The maker of homemade soda machines that
appeared on the cover of  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) ’s Christmas
circular, benefited from rising sales last quarter in the U.S.,
said Jim Chartier, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co.  “Most people think the fourth quarter was good in the U.S.
as the machines seem to have been given as top gifts,”
Chartier, who has a “buy” rating on the shares, said by phone
in New York. The stock is also gaining on speculation that
“guidance they will give for 2012 will beat street
expectations,” he said.  Since the last options  expiration  on Feb. 17, six of the 10
contracts with the biggest increase in ownership were calls.
March $50 calls, with a strike 5.3 percent above yesterday’s
close, added 1,747 options to 2,637, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Those contracts were the most traded yesterday.  Exceeding Guidance  Calls give investors the right to buy a security for a
certain amount, the so-called strike price, by a set date. Puts
convey the right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities that they own, to
speculate on share-price moves or to bet that volatility, or
stock swings, will rise or fall.  Options traders are pushing the cost of Sodastream calls
versus puts to an almost five-month high. Contracts 10 percent
above the current stock price cost 0.9 times puts trading 10
percent below, according to data on three-month options compiled
by Bloomberg. The  price relationship  touched 0.96 on Feb. 27,
its highest level since October.  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict that SodaStream’s
fourth-quarter sales will exceed the company’s guidance of 62
million euros because of a surge in demand for the machines,
which  retail  from $99.99 at Bed, Bath & Beyond, during the
Christmas season. The Israeli company will probably report a 27
percent jump in revenue to 63.7 million euros, according to the
average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Green Mountain  SodaStream also gained on speculation that higher-than-
expected profit for  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)  will
translate into increased earnings for the soda machine maker,
Chartier said. The maker of coffee machines surged 24 percent on
Feb. 2, the day after it reported net income in the three months
to Dec. 24 rose to $104.4 million, from $2.41 million a year
earlier.  Like Waterbury, Vermont-based Green Mountain, SodaStream
benefits from the so-called razor blade model of retailing,
where customers are repeatedly required to buy complementary
products such as gas tanks and flavor pouches. The 120-day
 correlation  of gains or losses in the shares climbed to a record
0.45 on Feb. 22, signaling the companies are moving in tandem.
It was at 0.43 yesterday.  “When they reported the stock surged more than 20 percent,
so you could have people looking for a similar move for Soda,”
Chartier said.  N.Y. Beating Tel Aviv  SodaStream shares have gained 138 percent since the company
 raised  $109 million in a November 2010 initial public offering.  Israel , whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
