Canada ’s dollar advanced for a
second day, touching the strongest level in a week, as the
prospect of a second round of European Central Bank three-year
loans to banks eased demand for the refuge of the U.S. currency.  The Canadian dollar was headed for a 0.7 percent gain this
month versus its U.S. counterpart, which is down against most
major currencies. Commodities such as copper rose as confidence
among American consumers climbed to the highest in a year.
Canada derives about half its export revenue from raw materials,
and its biggest trade partner is the U.S.  “The potential impact of the looming LTRO can’t be
dismissed,”  David Watt , senior currency strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in Toronto, said of
the ECB’s longer-term refinancing operation. “U.S.  consumer
confidence  numbers are helping too. The better consumer
confidence numbers give hope that the U.S. economic backdrop is
improving.”  Canada’s dollar, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, appreciated 0.4 percent to 99.53
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto. The currency, which
reached 99.42 cents, the most since Feb. 21, has appreciated 2.6
percent this year. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0047.  Loonie Versus Krone  “Post-LTRO, I’ll be watching the Canadian dollar versus
the Norwegian krone,” Watt said. “It’s been a virtual one-way
bet since mid-January, and it has now paused.”  The krone has gained 6.4 percent since Jan. 16 versus
Canada’s currency. It dropped 0.6 percent yesterday, its first
loss in four days, before gaining 0.4 percent today to 5.5922 to
the loonie.  Copper futures for May delivery climbed as much as 2.1
percent to $3.9575 a pound in  New York , the highest since Feb.
10, before trading at $3.9160, up 1.1 percent.  The loonie pared gains earlier after reports showed orders
for durable goods in the U.S. fell by the most in three years
and home prices in 20 American cities dropped more than
economists forecast.  The currency fell versus the euro and counterparts that
included  Brazil ’s real and the South African rand.  “The Canadian dollar is lagging the broader market,” said
 Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at  National
Bank of Canada  in Toronto. “It is being influenced by the
overall pressure being put to bear on the U.S. dollar. Canada
does trade as a proxy for  North America .”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index rose 0.3 percent after
falling 0.1 percent. The MSCI World Index rose 0.4 percent after
dropping 0.1 percent.  ECB Operation  After giving euro-region banks a record 489 billion euros
($655 billion) in its first refinancing operation on Dec. 21,
the  Frankfurt  based ECB will probably lend them another 470
billion euros this week, according a Bloomberg News survey. The
loans will be allotted tomorrow. The operations are designed to
increase liquidity and avert a credit crunch.  “The U.S. dollar is weaker as the market readies for
tomorrow’s ECB LTRO operation,”  John Curran , senior vice
president in Toronto at CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign-
exchange dealer, wrote in a note to clients today. The currency,
which has traded for 24 straight days within a 2-cent range, is
“well-contained,” Curran said. He predicted it will weaken to
C$1.03 by the end of March.  Resistance Levels  The U.S. dollar “failed at key resistance levels”
yesterday in the area of C$1.0050 to C$1.0070,  Niall O’Connor , a
technical analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, wrote in
a note to clients today. The greenback closed yesterday at 99.90
Canadian cents after touching C$1.0050. Resistance refers to the
upper boundary of a trading range, where sell orders may be
clustered. Support, or the lower boundary of the range, at 99.06
cents to 98.90 cents, “stays critical,” he wrote.  Government bonds  due in five years and longer rose, pushing
the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.98 percent. It touched 1.96
percent, the lowest level since Feb. 3. The price of the 3.25
percent note due in June 2021 advanced 27 cents to C$110.74.
Two-year yields rose less than one basis point to 1.07 percent.  Canada will sell C$3.5 billion ($3.5 billion) of two-year
debt tomorrow, according to a statement on a  Bank of Canada 
website. The 0.75 percent securities mature in May 2014.  The bid-to-cover ratio, or the amount bid divided by the
amount offered, at a Feb. 8 auction of two-year debt was 2.34
times, compared with an average of 2.47 times at the past five
sales, according to Bank of Canada data. A higher ratio
indicates stronger demand. The Feb. 8 offering drew an average
yield of 1.095 percent.  U.S. Consumer Confidence  The loonie gained versus the U.S. dollar as the Conference
Board’s index of U.S.  consumer sentiment  increased more than
forecast for February, to 70.8 from a revised 61.5 in January.
The New York-based private research group released the data
today. Economists predicted the gauge would climb to 63,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  The greenback fell versus most major peers as U.S.  home
prices  dropped more than forecast in December to the lowest
level since the housing crisis began in mid-2006.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
fell 4 percent from a year earlier, after decreasing 3.9 percent
in November, data from the group showed today. Orders for U.S.
durable goods dropped in January by the most in three years, 4
percent, a government report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
