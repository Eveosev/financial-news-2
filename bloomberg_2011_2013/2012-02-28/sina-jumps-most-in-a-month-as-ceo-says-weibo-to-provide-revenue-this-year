Sina Corp. (SINA) , which runs the Twitter-
like Weibo service in  China , jumped the most in a month on
prospects its microblogging service will start to contribute to
revenue in the second half of this year.  Sina surged 12.2 percent to $70.65 by 10:59 a.m. in New
York, the biggest intraday gain since Jan. 27.  The Shanghai-based company plans to get “meaningful
monetization” from Weibo in the second half of 2012, Chief
Executive Officer Charles Chao said in a conference call
yesterday after U.S. markets closed. Sina will start a Weibo-
based display advertising system in the second quarter and
several fee-based services beginning in the second half.  “More clarity on Weibo monetization is encouraging,” Ming Zhao, a Boston-based equity analyst at Susquehanna International
Group LLP wrote in a research note today. “All these progresses
point to a decent change in the financials starting from the
second half.”  Sina has more than 300 million registered accounts for
Weibo, CEO Chao said, up from more than 250 million users
registered as of November.  Fourth-quarter net income at Sina totaled $9.28 million,
compared with a loss of $100 million a year earlier. Analysts
predicted profit of $10.4 million, according to the average of
10  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 21 percent to
$133.4 million, of which $103.7 million came from advertising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
