Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and other
telecommunication companies “will benefit” from draft European
Union rules intended to reduce roaming fees, said  Neelie Kroes ,
the vice president of the European Commission for digital
agenda.  Vodafone Chief Executive Officer Vittorio Colao called
yesterday for a stop to an “autopilot regulation mentality”
that continually puts new regulations on industry and damages
resources. EU regulators last year proposed prices caps for
Internet-data charges outside a user’s home country from July 1.
The rules need the backing of EU governments and lawmakers
before they become final.  “If consumers lose their fear of using their smartphones
and tablets when traveling across  Europe , operators will benefit
as well,” Kroes said in an e-mailed statement. “Message to
Vittorio and Vodafone: I call your bluff, and indeed do not
respond well to threats. I take the side of the Vodafone
customer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
