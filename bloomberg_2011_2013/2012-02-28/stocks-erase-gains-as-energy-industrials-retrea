U.S. stocks erased gains as energy
and industrial stocks retreated, wiping out an earlier rally
triggered by a jump in consumer confidence to a one-year high.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,367.94 at 1:56 p.m. in  New York  after earlier rising as much
as 0.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
