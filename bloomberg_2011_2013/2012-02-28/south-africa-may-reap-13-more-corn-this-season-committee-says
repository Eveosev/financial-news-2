South Africa  may reap 13 percent
more corn this season as farmers plant larger areas with the
grain, the Crop Estimates Committee said.  Farmers may harvest 11.7 million metric tons, including 6.8
million tons of white and 4.9 million tons of yellow corn, Marda
Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the committee, said by phone from
 Pretoria  today.  The forecast exceeds the 11.4 million-ton average estimate
of seven traders polled by Bloomberg News. The nation produced
10.36 million tons last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
