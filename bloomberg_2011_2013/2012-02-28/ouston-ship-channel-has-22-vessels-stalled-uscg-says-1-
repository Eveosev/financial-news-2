Sixty-four ships were idled at the
 Houston Ship Channel  serving the largest U.S. petroleum port at
about 6 p.m. local time today after fog limited visibility, the
U.S. Coast Guard said.  Houston port pilots suspended boardings at 12:30 a.m.,
Albert Hernandez, a Coast Guard watch supervisor said today in a
telephone interview.  As of 6 p.m., 30 ships were waiting to enter the port and
34 were waiting to depart, Walter Aldridge, an assistant watch
supervisor, said in a telephone interview.  Dense fog limiting visibility to 0.25 mile (0.4 kilometer)
or less was expected to persist until 10 a.m. local time
tomorrow, the  National Weather Service  said in a  statement  on
its website.  “It never really cleared out,” Aldridge said. “It
cleared out a little bit, but we’re expecting it to roll back in
again this evening.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
