Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , owner of the for-
profit University of Phoenix, fell 13 percent in pre-market
trading after cutting its forecast for earnings and student
enrollment.  Enrollment for the second quarter will be little changed or
show low single-digit percentage growth, compared with an
earlier forecast of about 13 percent growth, according to a
statement today from the Phoenix-based company.  Profit for the year ending August will be between $625
million and $725 million, excluding special items, down from an
earlier forecast of $655 million to $750 million.  The shares fell $6.51 to $44.89 at 9 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
