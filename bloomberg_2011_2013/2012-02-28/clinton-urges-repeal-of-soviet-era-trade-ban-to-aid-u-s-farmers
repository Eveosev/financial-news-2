U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  urged Congress to overturn a Cold War-era law aimed at
punishing the Communist  Soviet Union , claiming U.S. farmers and
producers are being hurt by the outdated statute.  “We ought to lift it, failing to lift it will put our
farmers and manufacturers and our workers at a disadvantage,”
Clinton said today in testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.  Congress passed the Jackson-Vanik amendment in 1974,
barring favorable trade between the nations because the Soviet
Union wouldn’t let Jewish citizens emigrate. Annual waivers have
been allowed since 1993, two years after the Communist
government collapsed.  Russia is poised to join the World Trade Organization in
May or June, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said this month.
President Barack Obama has said he supports Russia becoming a
member of the international trade arbiter, which would allow
reduced tariffs and greater transparency.  Lawmakers including Representatives Chris Smith, a New
Jersey Republican, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Democrat,
have questioned repealing the law and easing trade with Russia,
citing its record on human rights and economic policies.  Senator  Richard Durbin  of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in
the Senate, told reporters today Russia’s attitude toward Syria
would “definitely” slow debate on overturning Jackson-Vanik.  To contact the reporter on this story:
