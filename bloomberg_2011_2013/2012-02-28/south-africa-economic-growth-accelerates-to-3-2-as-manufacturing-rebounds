South Africa ’s economy, the largest
on the continent, expanded at a faster pace in the fourth
quarter than the previous three months as manufacturing
rebounded after strikes and consumers boosted spending.  Growth in  gross domestic product  accelerated to an
annualized 3.2 percent from a revised 1.7 percent in the
previous three months, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa
said on its website today. The median  estimate  in a Bloomberg
survey of 15 economists was for growth of 3.1 percent.  Factory output expanded last quarter as interest rates at
the lowest level in more than 30 years spurred spending, while
mining grew for the first time in a year. Growth is still less
than half the government’s targeted expansion of 7 percent, with
the debt crisis in  Europe  undermining South Africa’s recovery,
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said on Feb. 22.  “We’ve seen a recovery in manufacturing from the strikes”
in the first half of last year, Elna Moolman, an economist at
 Renaissance Capital  in Johannesburg, said in a telephone
interview. “But given the slowdown we’re seeing globally, we’re
unlikely to see much growth in that sector.”  The rand strengthened to 7.5213 against the dollar as of
12:16 p.m. in Johannesburg from 7.5333 before the data was
released. The yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, fell
1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.66 percent today.  Europe Crisis  Gordhan is struggling to boost growth as a possible
recession in Europe lowers demand from a region that buys a
third of South Africa’s manufactured goods.  The economy will probably expand 2.8 percent this year,
Moolman said, above the 2.7 percent forecast by the government.
The economy grew 3.1 percent in 2011, the statistics office said
today.  Manufacturing (SFPMNSAY) , which makes up 15 percent of the economy,
expanded an annualized 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter
compared with a contraction of 0.7 percent in the previous three
months, the statistics office said. Mining rebounded from an 18
percent contraction in the third quarter to grow 0.7 percent.  Consumer spending , which makes up two-thirds of expenditure
in the economy and has led a recovery from recession in 2009, is
benefiting from rising wages, low interest rates and an increase
in credit. The central bank has kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 5.5 percent since November 2010.  The retail industry rose an annualized 5.2 percent last
quarter from a 6.1 percent in the previous three months, the
statistics office said. Financial services increased 2.3 percent
from 4.5 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
