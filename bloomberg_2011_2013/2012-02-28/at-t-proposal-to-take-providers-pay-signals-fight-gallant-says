An  AT&T Inc. (T)  proposal to let
providers of mobile applications pay part of the cost of data
traffic may ignite a “major political battle in Washington,”
an analyst said.  Policy groups would contend such a plan violates Federal
Communications Commission rules designed to prevent  Internet
providers  from unfairly favoring some content and service
companies over others,  Paul Gallant , a Washington-based analyst
with Guggenheim Partners, said today in a note to clients.  AT&T, the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier, has warned
it will reduce access speeds or limit consumption by the
heaviest users as it copes with a surge in data traffic from
more smartphones and tablets. The plan to accept payment from
companies that provide applications and content such as video
was reported yesterday by the Wall Street Journal.  The FCC’s rules adopted in 2010 don’t directly forbid such
payments, Gallant said. Groups may argue the arrangement would
harm innovation by small companies, he said.  Michael Balmoris, a Washington-based spokesman for AT&T,
said in an e-mail today that the company hasn’t “landed on any
new business models for supporting consumers’ use of data-
intensive applications, but we’re always thinking about how we
can innovate and collaborate with others to provide the best
mobile experience for our customers.”  Neil Grace, a spokesman for the FCC, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
