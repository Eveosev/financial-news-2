(Corrects amount in headline.)  The U.K. government may make a
profit of as much as 11 billion pounds ($17 billion) by 2027
from its nationalization of  Northern Rock , according to U.K.
Financial Investments.  UKFI, which manages the government’s bank stakes, predicted
a cash return of 46 billion pounds to 48 billion pounds from
loan repayments, interest and equity value over the next 10 to
15 years, it said in a statement today. The government has
provided 37 billion pounds of funding for the bank, UKFI said.  “In cash terms, the companies are expected to more than
repay the original funding provided by the taxpayer,” UKFI said
in the statement.  Northern Rock was nationalized in February 2008 after the
Newcastle-based lender suffered the first run on a U.K. bank in
more than a century. In 2010, Northern Rock Plc, the consumer
bank, separated from Northern Rock Asset Management Plc, which
holds mortgages.  Billionaire  Richard Branson ’s Virgin Money Holdings U.K.
Ltd. agreed to buy Northern Rock Plc in November for 747 million
pounds, marking the first sale of a British government bank
holding since the 2008 financial crisis. The sale of Northern
Rock Plc left the taxpayer with stakes in  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  and the remainder of
Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley.  The 48 billion pounds is equivalent to an annual return of
3.5 percent to 4.5 percent on the funding provided to Northern
Rock. Britain has received repayments of 18 billion pounds from
the bank since it was bailed out, UKFI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
