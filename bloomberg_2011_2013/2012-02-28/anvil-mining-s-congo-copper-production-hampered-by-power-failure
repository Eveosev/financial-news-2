Anvil Mining Ltd. (AVM) , which relies on
copper for all of its revenue, said power outages, low water
levels and infrastructure failures have eroded output at its
Kinsevere cathode plant in the  Democratic Republic  of Congo.  Temporary on-site generation is being arranged and power
transformers are being upgraded to improve the Congo operation
where 4,000 metric tons of copper cathode have been produced so
far this year, Anvil said today in a statement to the  Australian
Stock Exchange (GXA) .  Anvil Mining produced 18,033 tons of copper in the first
nine months of last year, all from its Congo operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
