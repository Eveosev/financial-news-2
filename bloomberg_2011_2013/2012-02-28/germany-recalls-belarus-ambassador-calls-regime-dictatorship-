Germany  recalled its ambassador from
Belarus in response to the latter nation’s demand that the head
of the European Union mission and Polish ambassador leave the
Belarusian capital Minsk.  “It is for us as Europeans intolerable that human and
civil rights be damaged in Belarus like this,” German Foreign
Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said in an e-mailed statement today.
“It is the last dictatorship in  Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
