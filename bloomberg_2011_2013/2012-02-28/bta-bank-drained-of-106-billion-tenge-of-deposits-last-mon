BTA Bank, the biggest Kazakh lender
before defaulting on $12 billion of debt in 2009, lost 106
billion tenge ($718 million) of deposits in January amid plans
to restructure its debt for the second time in as many years.  Total deposits shrank to 630 billion tenge in January from
736 billion tenge in December, the Kazakh central bank’s
financial oversight committee said in a monthly report on its
 website  today. The liabilities of the lender exceeded assets by
300 billion tenge under international accounting standards as of
Feb. 1, compared with a gap of 241 billion tenge a month
earlier, the regulator said.  BTA is negotiating its second debt restructuring since 2010
after failing to make an interest payment on its July 2018
dollar bonds in January. The Almaty-based lender faces the risk
of a run on deposits, acting Chief Executive Officer Askhat Beisenbayev said last month.  The following table shows the one-month performance of
 Kazakhstan ’s five largest lenders by assets, along with 7th-
ranked Alliance Bank and 13th-ranked Temirbank, and their
position as of Feb. 1. The data from the oversight committee are
in billions of tenge:  To contact the reporter on this story:
