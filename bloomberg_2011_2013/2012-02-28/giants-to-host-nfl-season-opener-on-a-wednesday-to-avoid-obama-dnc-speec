The  Super Bowl  champion New York
Giants will host the first game of the 2012 National Football
League season on a Wednesday night to avoid conflicting with
U.S. President Barack Obama’s speech at the Democratic National
Convention, the league said yesterday in a news release.  The NFL schedule usually starts on Thursday, when the
president would be speaking. The last NFL game on a Wednesday
was a September 1948 game between the Los Angeles Rams and
 Detroit Lions , the league said.  The opponent for the Giants in the Sept. 5 game at MetLife
Stadium in East Rutherford,  New Jersey , wasn’t disclosed. The
Giants, who won the Super Bowl championship earlier this month,
last hosted the season opener in 2008, after winning the
previous season’s title game.  That game was moved 90 minutes earlier to avoid conflicting
with  John McCain ’s speech at the Republican Party’s presidential
convention.  The Giants beat the New England Patriots 21-17 in the Super
Bowl in Indianapolis this month. They also beat the Patriots in
the 2008 title game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
