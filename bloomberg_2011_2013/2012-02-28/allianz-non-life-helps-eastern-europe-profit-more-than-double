Allianz SE (ALV) ,  Europe ’s biggest
insurer, said operating profit in eastern Europe more than
doubled last year on higher earnings at the property and
casualty insurance units.  Operating profit in the region increased to 295 million
euros ($397 million), from 114 million euros a year earlier, the
Munich-based insurer said in a statement on its website today.  Allianz’s total premium income from eastern European
markets, including Russia, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, was
little changed at 3.8 billion euros while sales at the company’s
property and casualty units in the region fell 2.2 percent to
2.57 billion euros.  “We are satisfied with the strong recovery in profits and
we are well positioned to benefit from any upturn in the
markets,” said Manuel Bauer, who is responsible for growth
markets on Allianz’s management board. “Our stable business
portfolio and underlying earnings resilience puts us in a good
position to weather economic headwinds in 2012.”  Operating profit at Allianz’s non-life carriers more than
tripled to 194 million euros while earnings at the life and
health insurance division gained 20 percent to 77 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
