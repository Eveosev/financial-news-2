Catcher  Jason Varitek , who helped
lead Boston to two World Series championships and was Red Sox
captain from 2005-11, will announce his retirement today at the
team’s spring training camp, the  Boston Globe reported .  Varitek, 39, is expected to stay with the team to begin his
post-playing career, the Globe said, without revealing where it
got the information. His announcement will come at the team’s
camp in  Fort Myers , Florida, the newspaper said.  Red Sox spokeswoman Pam Ganley didn’t respond to an e-mail
seeking comment.  Varitek was a three-time All-Star in 15 Major League
Baseball seasons, all with the Red Sox. His career batting
average was .256, with 193 home runs and 757 runs batted in.  Carl Yastrzemski (23 seasons),  Ted Williams  (19) and Jim Rice (16) are the only players who had longer Red Sox tenures
while spending their entire career in Boston.  Varitek played in 63 postseason games for Boston, helping
the Red Sox to the 2004 and 2007 World Series titles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
