Athens International Airport saw
profit rise by 7.2 percent in 2011 because of a lower tax bill.  Net income rose to 104 million euros ($140 million) from 97
million euros in 2010, the Athens-based company said in a
 statement  posted on its website. The airport,  Greece ’s biggest,
paid 25.5 million euros in tax, down from 62 million euros the
previous year as extraordinary levies in 2010 weren’t repeated,
according to the statement.  Greece aims to raise 50 billion euros by 2017 from selling
and renting assets. Extending the concession to operate Athens
International, and a possible stake sale of as much as 30
percent, are part of the plan. Greece owns 55 percent of the
airport and  Hochtief AG (HOT)  40 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
