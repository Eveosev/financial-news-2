UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest bank,
said Chairman Dieter Rampl won’t stand for another term as the
lender decides whether to reduce the size of its board.  “Rampl informed the board of his decision not to be
available for a further mandate,” the Milan-based company said
yesterday in a statement. UniCredit’s board expires in April and
shareholders are scheduled to elect a new board May 11.  UniCredit may cut the size of the board to 15 members from
23, La Stampa reported earlier this month. Rampl, 64, who
presented the plan to the  Bank of Italy , has sought to reduce
the seats assigned to the lender’s foundations, which include
Fondazione CRT and Cariverona, to three from nine, the newspaper
said.  Chief Executive Officer  Federico Ghizzoni , 56, may be
reconfirmed in his role after the bank completed a 7.5 billion
euro ($10 billion) share sale in January to plug a capital
shortfall and comply with European Banking Authority targets.  Ghizzoni, to entice investors, said he would undertake a
cost-cutting reorganization and boost profitability as the bank
focuses on four core countries: Italy, Germany, Austria and
Poland.  The lender also is reducing staff to help boost
profitability after reporting a third-quarter loss of 10.6
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
