Ireland won’t be able to pass a
referendum on European Union fiscal controls without a
“substantial re-arrangement” of its debt,  Brian Hayes , a
junior government minister, told the  Sunday Business Post .  Ireland will pay back its debts, the newspaper cited Hayes
as saying. Still, the government wants to refinance loans taken
to recapitalize banks including  Anglo Irish Bank  Corp. before
the country’s bailout last year, the newspaper said, without
saying where it got the information.  Hayes’s role straddles both the Finance Ministry and the
Ministry for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The state injected 46 billion euros ($60 billion) into the
country’s banks before Ireland’s rescue by the International
Monetary Fund and European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
