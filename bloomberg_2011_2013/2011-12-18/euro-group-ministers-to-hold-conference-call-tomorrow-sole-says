Euro-area finance ministers will
probably hold a conference call Monday afternoon, Dec. 19, 
together with their other European Union counterparts, with 
the exception of the U.K.,  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported today,
citing no one.  The call will focus on technical issues related to the
agreement for a new fiscal pact reached at the Dec. 9 EU
summit that the U.K. refused to join, Sole said today. Ministers
will also discuss contributions to the  International Monetary
Fund  that may be used to tame the sovereign-debt crisis, the
Milan-based newspaper said in an article written from 
Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
