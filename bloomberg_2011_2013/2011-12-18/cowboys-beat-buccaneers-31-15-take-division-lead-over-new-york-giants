Tony Romo  threw for three touchdowns
and ran for another as the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers 31-15 and moved past the New York Giants into first
place in the NFC East Division.  The Cowboys avoided their third straight National Football
League loss with the win at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa,
Florida, while the Buccaneers lost their eighth straight game to
fall to 4-10 after getting off to a 4-2 start to the season.  Miles Austin, Dez Bryant and Laurent Robinson each caught
touchdown passes from Romo, who completed 23-of-30 passes for
249 yards in the game.  With the win, the Cowboys moved into first in their
division at 8-6, one-half game ahead of the  New York Giants , who 
will face the Washington Redskins tomorrow.  Last week, the Cowboys squandered a 12-point lead with less
than four minutes remaining in the game in a 37-34 loss to the
Giants. A week earlier, Dallas lost 19-13 to the  Arizona
Cardinals  in overtime after holding a seven-point lead in the
fourth quarter.  Tampa Bayâ€™s last win came on Oct. 16 in a 26-20 victory of
the  New Orleans Saints .  To contact the reporter on this story:
