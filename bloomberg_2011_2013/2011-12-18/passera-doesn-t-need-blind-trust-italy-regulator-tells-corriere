Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  former Chief
Executive Officer Corrado Passera doesn’t need to put his
financial assets in a blind trust after becoming development
minister, Italy’s antitrust chief told  Corriere della Sera .  “There is no law forcing the minister to set up a blind
trust,” the Milan-based newspaper cited Giovanni Pitruzzella,
head the Competition Authority, as saying in an interview
published today.  Passera said in a Dec. 6 interview on state-owned RAI
television that he had yet to decide whether to sell his shares
of Intesa, Italy’s second-largest bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
