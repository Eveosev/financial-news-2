An alleged fraud in operations with
sovereign bonds may lead to a 1 billion-real ($540 million) loss
to  Brazil ’s government or to state-owned lender Caixa Economica
Federal,  Folha de S. Paulo  reported.  Rio de Janeiro-based brokerage Gestora de Recebiveis Tetto
Habitacao Ltda. sold overvalued  government bonds  to investors
including Banco Bradesco SA and Brazil’s post office employee
pension fund Postalis, according to the São Paulo-based
newspaper, which said it had access to confidential lawsuit
documents.  The alleged fraud happened between Sept. 2008 and Aug.
2009, period during which Caixa’s information system responsible
for the data related to the bonds wasn’t working, which may make
Caixa or the Brazilian government responsible for the potential
losses taken by the bonds’ buyers, Folha said.  Caixa didn’t immediately return Bloomberg calls and e-mail
seeking comment. Bloomberg couldn’t locate Tetto or its owner
Eugenio Pacelli Marques de Almeida Holanda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
