U.S. online spending for the holiday
season has risen 15 percent to $30.9 billion from the year-
earlier period,  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)  said.  Four days during the week ended Dec. 16 topped
$1 billion, the Internet-traffic researcher said in a statement.
Sales for last week were $6.32 billion, also up 15 percent.  Spending is expected to slow as Christmas Day nears,
ComScore said. This means Cyber Monday, Nov. 28, is likely to be
the single top online spending day with $1.25 billion, followed
by $1.13 billion in purchases on Dec. 12 and $1.07 billion on
Dec. 16, or Free Shipping Day.  The data measured the 46-day period from Nov. 1 to Dec. 16.  ComScore, based in Reston,  Virginia , compiles Internet
traffic data from about 2 million consumers in 170 countries,
according to its own website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
