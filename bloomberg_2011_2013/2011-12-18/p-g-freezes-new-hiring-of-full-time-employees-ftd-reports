Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  has stopped
hiring full-time employees amid slower-than-expected growth,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing a company spokesman
it didnâ€™t identify.  With the exception of Germany, the company sees growth
slowing in  Europe  and the U.S., the newspaper reported in an
advance release of an article to be published tomorrow, citing
the spokesman. Growth in Asia is below expectations, the
spokesman also said, according to the newspaper.  The move is a short-term measure that can be lifted on
short notice, FTD reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
