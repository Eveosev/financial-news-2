Egypt ’s North Sinai gas pipeline,
which transports gas to Israel and Jordan, was attacked for the
10th time this year, Egyptian Natural Gas Co. Chairman Magdi
Tawfik said.  Unidentified attackers planted two explosive devices
beneath the pipeline near the city of El Arish even as it was
being repaired following a similar attack last month, Egypt’s
Oil Ministry said in a faxed statement today. There were no
casualties, the ministry said.  Gas was not flowing in the pipeline at the time of today’s
attack and the company is still assessing the damage, Tawfik
said by telephone in Cairo today.  A spokesman at East Mediterranean Gas Co., which owns and
operates the undersea extension, did not answer a phone call
seeking comment.  “The attack targeted one of the tubes in the network as it
was being repaired,” Tawfik said. “We will continue with the
repairs.”  The incident underscores Egypt’s challenge in securing the
pipeline, jeopardizing a key source of foreign-currency income
and threatening to worsen its already soured relations with its
eastern neighbor.  The attack is the latest in a series that have affected the
gas pipeline infrastructure in the Sinai since February, when a
popular uprising forced former Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak 
to resign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
