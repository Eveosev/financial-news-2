Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC)  rose
the most in almost two weeks after the world’s largest
petrochemicals company proposed paying the highest annual cash
dividend since 2005.  The shares advanced as much as 2.4 percent, the most since
Dec. 5, to 96 riyals, before trading at 95.50 riyals at 11:30
a.m. in  Riyadh .  The board of the Riyadh-based company recommended a second-
half dividend of 3 riyals a share after paying 2 riyals for the
first six months, it said in a statement today. That made the
2011 cash dividend the company’s highest since 2005, according
to data posted on the  Saudi bourse website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
