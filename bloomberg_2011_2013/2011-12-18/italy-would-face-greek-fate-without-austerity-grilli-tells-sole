Italy would have ended up like
 Greece  had the government not pushed through a 30 billion-euro
($39 billion) emergency budget, Deputy Finance Minister Vittorio Grilli told Il Sole 24 Ore in an interview published today.  Without the package, “our future was Greece,” Sole cited
Grilli as saying. Prime Minister  Mario Monti  and Development
Minister Corrado Passera “are now working on a package of
measures” to spur economic growth, Grilli told the Milan-based
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
