Gree Electric Appliances Inc. (000651) ,
 China ’s largest home air conditioner maker, has raised revenue
by at least one-third in 2011 as it sells aggressively in rural
China, a senior executive said.  Gree Electric, which also manufactures air conditioners for
overseas companies including Daikin Industries Ltd., will report
revenue of greater than 80 billion yuan ($12.6 Billion) this
year, said Dong Mingzhu, the company’s president, in an
interview at its Zhuhai headquarters on Dec. 17. Revenue in 2010
was 60.3 billion yuan.  In addition to selling inside China, Gree is looking to
expand overseas and will target emerging markets where the cost
of setting up manufacturing facilities is lower, she said.  “We want to bring Gree’s products to every corner of the
world, but it’s not easy to plant a flag everywhere,” Dong said.
“For example, the cost of setting up a manufacturing hub in the
U.S. will be very high, so we’ll first focus on  developing
countries  where both wages, land and other operating expenses
are lower.”  Gree competes against  GD Midea Holding Co. (000527)  and  Haier Group
Corp.  in the world’s most-populous nation, which embarked on a
rural appliances stimulus program in 2009 to boost domestic
consumption at the height of the global financial crisis. China
sold 29.8 billion yuan ($4.7 billion) worth of appliances in
November under the program, a 66 percent jump from a year
earlier, according to the Ministry of Commerce.  Gree, which generated 17 percent of its sales outside China
last year, set up a subsidiary in the U.S. in June.  The shares of Gree have declined 6 percent this year in
Shenzhen, compared with a 21 percent drop in the benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index. Gree rose 3.3 percent to 17.03 yuan on
Dec. 16.  The company’s third-quarter net income rose 19 percent from
a year ago earlier to 1.57 billion yuan, according to a
statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange on Oct. 27.  Sales of electronics and appliances in China are estimated
to surge 70 percent to 2.14 trillion yuan by 2015 from 2010,
according to London-based researcher Euromonitor International.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
