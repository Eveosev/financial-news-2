The exodus of business people from
 Tokyo  on the 155-minute bullet-train journey to the relative
calm of Osaka this year gave restaurants in Japan’s second-
biggest city a chance to show their talents to some new diners.  The nuclear-disaster worry has faded, though some of the
nation’s finest cuisine remains in Osaka -- it won more stars in
the Michelin guide released in October. Osaka’s offerings
include the finest traditional cuisine, including kushi katsu
deep-fry and udon noodles, alongside European and Asian fare.  Here are our top choices for business dining in the city.  Osaka/Umeda Station Area  Mogami: 1-10-16 Sonezakishinchi, Kita-Ku, Osaka. Information:
