India ’s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh inducted a minister into his cabinet today to accommodate
a regional party that joined the federal ruling coalition last
week.  Ajit Singh , 72, the leader of the  Rashtriya Lok Dal  party
that has a voter base in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh,
was sworn in today as the minister for civil aviation, according
to an e-mailed statement from President Pratibha Devisingh Patil’s office. Vayalar Ravi was the minister for aviation, in
addition to being the minister for overseas Indian affairs,
before today’s appointment, according to the prime minister’s
 website .  The Congress party, which heads the national coalition
government, forged the alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal to
boost its prospects in  Uttar Pradesh , where elections are due in
the first half of 2012.  Rahul Gandhi , scion of the Nehru-Gandhi
dynasty, has started a campaign to help return the Congress to
power in India’s most-populous state, 23 years after his party
lost to regional groupings.  The Rashtriya Lok Dal’s five members in the lower house of
parliament will also help increase the strength of Manmohan
Singh’s coalition to 268, which is four short of a majority.  Ajit Singh had earlier served as the farm minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s cabinet between 2001 and 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
