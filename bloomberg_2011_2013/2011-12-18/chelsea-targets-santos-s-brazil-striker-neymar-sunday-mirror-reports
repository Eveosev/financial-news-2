Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas
has made Santos’s Brazil striker Neymar his top transfer target,
the  Sunday Mirror reported .  The Premier League soccer club may have to pay 45 million
pounds ($70 million) for the 19-year-old Neymar, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Villas-Boas wants five new players and is keen to reduce
the average age of his squad, the Mirror said. Newcastle
midfielder Cheick Tiote, Lyon fullback Aly Cissokho and
Montpellier center-back Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa are also targets, the
newspaper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
