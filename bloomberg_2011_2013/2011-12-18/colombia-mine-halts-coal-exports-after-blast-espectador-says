Guerillas bombed a railway serving
the world’s largest open-pit coal mine for exports, blocking
shipments of the mineral for at least three days, El Espectador
reported.  Fighters with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
attacked the rail line early today about 15 kilometers (9 miles)
from the Cerrejon mine, blowing up 250 meters of track and
derailing a coal train, the newspaper reported, citing Mining
Minister Mauricio Cardenas.  Julian Gonzalez, Cerrejon’s director of sustainability,
said the blast will jeopardize production targets, and it will
take at least three days to repair the railway, the newspaper
reported in its online edition. Cerrejon produces 32 million
tons of coal a year and is owned by  BHP Billiton Plc (BHP) ,  Anglo
American Plc (AAL)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
