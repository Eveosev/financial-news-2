Russia ’s newly merged stock exchange
will seek to lure more companies to list in Moscow rather than
abroad and try to attract more funds from local investors, said
Ruben Aganbegyan, president of the Micex-RTS.  The Micex Stock Exchange merged with the RTS Exchange on
Dec. 16 and will maintain their separate indexes in Moscow, with
the so-called main market to trade ruble-denominated Micex-
listed equities and bonds and the standard market to trade RTS-
listed company stock denominated in dollars, according to a
 statement  on the RTS website. As many as 10 companies are
considering initial public offerings in Russia, Aganbegyan said.  A priority of the Micex-RTS will be to work on “getting
internal investing in Russia,” he said in a Bloomberg
Television interview from Moscow conducted on Dec. 16. “The
other big reform this year is improving the issuance of
securities in Russia to enable easier IPOs locally.”  Futures  on the RTS expiring in March rose 0.6 percent to
135,695 in U.S. trading on Dec. 16, and a separate  gauge 
measuring volatility in the futures dropped for a second day,
declining 2 percent to 49.08. Phone company  OAO Rostelecom (ROSYY) 
jumped the most in five weeks, as Moscow brokerage  Renaissance
Capital  raised its target price.  While the Micex handles about 70 percent of equity
transactions in Russia and the RTS dominates derivatives
trading, Russian  stock trading  in  London  outpaced the volumes in
Moscow for 13 straight months through September, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap widened to a three-year high
of 50 percent in August. Since coming to power in 2008, one of
President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s main stated aims has been to develop
Moscow as a global financial center.  IPOs Postponed  Volumes on the 30-stock Micex were $1.72 billion on Dec.
16, compared with $13.2 million on Dec. 15 for the Bloomberg
Russia-US 14 index of 14 Russian shares and American depositary
receipts traded in New York. The Russia-US 14 index fell 0.7
percent to 89.77 on Dec. 16, down 2.2 percent last week.  “Market conditions” saw some firms postpone their stock
placements “and what we’re doing is making sure we’re an
exchange rated to offer products around,” Aganbegyan said.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
lost 1.6 percent to HK$4.80 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:55
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped 2.4 percent
after North Korean state television reported the nation’s leader
 Kim Jong Il  had died and  Fitch Ratings  said it may cut some
European countries’ credit ratings.  Energy Exporter  OAO Mechel, Russia’s largest producer of steelmaking coal
which got 19 percent of 2010 sales from  Europe , added the most
in a week in U.S. trading as Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said European Union states should meet a Dec. 19
deadline for arranging loans to the  International Monetary Fund 
as part of a debt crisis-fighting accord.  The world’s biggest energy exporter, Russia is also the
largest exporter of palladium and nickel, which rose to a one-
week high. Europe is the country’s largest trading partner.  “For Russia, commodities are the factor to watch,” Tom Furda, director of Russian equity sales at Auerbach Grayson &
Co.’s Moscow-based brokerage partner UralSib Financial Corp.,
said by phone from New York on Dec. 16. “In order for Russian
equities to catch any wind, they’ll need positive news flow out
of Europe and commodities to sustain an advance.”  Nickel gained 3.7 percent to $18,550 a ton on the London
Metal Exchange, while copper surged 2 percent to settle at
$3.331 a pound on the Comex in New York, the biggest advance for
a most-active contract since Nov. 30. The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index  of 24 raw materials was little changed at 617.90 on Dec.
16, after dropping the previous two days.  Rostelecom Gains  Mechel (MTLR)  ADRs rose 3.1 percent to $8.95 in New York, paring
their weekly decline to 11 percent. Shares on the Micex fell 5.8
percent to 282.30 rubles, or the equivalent of $8.84. One Mechel
ADR is equivalent to one ordinary share.  ADRs of Rostelecom, Russia’s dominant fixed-line phone
company, jumped 5.1 percent to $28.25, the biggest one-day gain
since Nov. 10, after Renaissance Capital raised its price target
for the company’s Moscow-traded shares to 172 rubles from 165
rubles. Rostelecom climbed 4.1 percent to 147.24 rubles in
Moscow on Dec. 16, the equivalent of $4.61. One Rostelecom ADR
represents six ordinary shares.  Russia was formally admitted into the  World Trade
Organization  on Dec. 16 after 18 years of negotiations, the last
major economy to enter the Geneva-based body.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, lost 0.5 percent to $26.80 on Dec. 16.  Cheapest Market  The Micex index is the cheapest of the 21 emerging-market
indexes tracked by Bloomberg. The measure trades at 4.8 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies, compared with
9.9 times for  Brazil ’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  index and 14 for the  BSE India
Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   The Micex fell 0.7 percent to 1,383.42 on Dec. 16, bringing
its drop in the week to 0.9 percent. The RTS slipped 1.5 percent
to 1,373.73 and was down 2.6 percent last week.  Now is a good time to be “selectively buying assets”  Ian McCall , Managing Partner at Quesnell Capital SA, an emerging
markets investment adviser in Geneva that manages 100 million
Swiss francs of assets, including Russian stock, said by phone
on Dec. 16. “There’s value there for sure.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
