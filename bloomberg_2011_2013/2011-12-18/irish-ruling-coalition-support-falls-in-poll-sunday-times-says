Support for Ireland’s two ruling
coalition parties fell to a combined 41 percent following budget
cuts and tax increases announced this month, down from 52
percent in October, the  Sunday Times  said.  Backing for Fine Gael, the biggest party in government,
fell 7 percentage points during the period to 30 percent, the
Sunday Times reported today in its Irish edition, citing a poll
commissioned by the newspaper. Support for the  Labour Party 
declined 4 points to 11 percent, it said.  Fianna Fail, the country’s main opposition party, rose 5
points to 20 percent, while Sinn Fein increased 2 points to 21
percent in the survey, the newspaper said.  The poll, carried out by Dublin-based market research
company  Behaviour & Attitudes , surveyed 921 people between Dec.
7, the day after the government announced final adjustments to
the 2012 budget, and Dec. 12, the newspaper said, without giving
the margin of error.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
