Hungary’s  economic sentiment  index
dropped to a two-year low in December as the outlook for
businesses and consumers deteriorated.  The sentiment index fell to minus 24.6, the lowest since
December of 2009, from minus 23.2 the previous month, the
Budapest-based GKI research institute said today in an e-mailed
statement. The  business confidence  index dropped to minus 14.5
from minus 14 in November, while the  consumer confidence  fell to
minus 53.3 from minus 49.5.  Hungary asked for financial assistance last month from the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union, reversing
more than a year of shunning international aid, after the forint
weakened to a record against the euro and the government
struggled to raise planned amounts at debt auctions. The
country’s sovereign credit grade was cut to junk at Moody’s
Investors Service last month.  The forint has dropped 13 percent against the euro since
June 30, the worst performance in the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
