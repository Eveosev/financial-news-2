Brazil won’t let the real foreign
exchange rate strengthen to 1.60 per  U.S. dollar , Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega  told  O Estado de S. Paulo  in an
interview.  The government won’t let the currency rise as much as in
the past, and may double a levy on some short dollar positions
in the derivatives market if it sees excessive valuations, the
minister said, according to the Sao Paulo-based newspaper.  In a separate interview to  Folha de S. Paulo , Mantega said
the government may consider additional taxes on imports to
protect domestic industries from unfair competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
