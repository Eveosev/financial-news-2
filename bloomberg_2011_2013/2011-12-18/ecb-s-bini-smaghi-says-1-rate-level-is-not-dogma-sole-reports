European Central Bank  Executive
Board member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said the current 1 percent
level of  interest rates  “is not an impassable limit,”  Il Sole
24 Ore  reported, citing an interview.  “The ECB has never been dogmatic on this, but you need to
take into account that with an inflation rate beyond 2 percent,
an interest rate of 1 percent is actually a negative one in real
terms,” Bini Smaghi told the Milan-based newspaper in an
interview published today.  Bini Smaghi, who is stepping down from the central bank and
will attend his last Governing Council meeting this week, said
the amount of  government bonds  purchased by the ECB has to be
decided “according to the circumstances,” Sole reported.  The ECB “cannot replace the governments in their duty to
ensure sound public finances and an institutional framework of
the euro area that can reassure those who invest in European
financial markets,” Bini Smaghi said, according to Sole.  Bini Smaghi refused to comment on the causes of his
resignation from the ECB’s board, Sole said. “A central banker
can use the press exclusively for institutional reasons,
specifically to explain monetary policy,” the newspaper cited
him as saying. “He cannot use the press for personal purposes,
not even to defend himself from unfair and specious accusations
made with ulterior motives.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
