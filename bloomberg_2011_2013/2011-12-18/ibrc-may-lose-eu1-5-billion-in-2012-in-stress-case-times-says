Irish Bank Resolution Corporation
Ltd. , formerly Anglo Irish Bank Corp., may lose 1.5 billion
euros ($2 billion) next year under a stress-case scenario, the
 Sunday Times  reported, citing a European Union restructuring
plan for the lender.  A stress case is defined as a 70 percent peak-to-trough
fall in Irish commercial real-estate property prices and a 60
percent decline in the U.S. and U.K., the newspaper said.  IBRC, being wound down by the end of the decade, aims to
swing into a 148 million-euro profit in 2016, it said. Anglo
Irish posted a 17.7 billion-euro pre-tax loss in 2010 and a 12.8
billion-euro loss for 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
