Germany ’s  SGL Carbon SE  doesn’t see
a full takeover as likely by  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and the
carmaker’s heiress Susanne Klatten, Chief Financial Officer
Juergen Muth told the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung .  While BMW and other shareholders including Volkswagen AG
and Voith GmbH are interested mainly in carbon fiber, Klatten is
interested in other SGL products, Muth said. “We thus see our
independence strengthened,” he told the newspaper. BMW and
Klatten together hold about 44 percent in SGL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
