Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  will reduce
bonuses for its employees by 40 percent this year,  Der Sonntag 
reported, citing people familiar with the situation that it
didnâ€™t identify.  Bonuses will be cut to 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2
billion) from 5.05 billion francs last year, the report said.  The newspaper said  UBS AG (UBSN)  might cut its bonuses this year
as well, without citing anyone.  A Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
