The U.K. is making plans to evacuate
Britons living in Spain and  Portugal  in case the nations’
banking systems collapse, the Sunday Times reported, citing
people in the Foreign Office it didn’t identify.  The U.K. is discussing sending planes, ships and buses to
bring citizens back to Britain or giving them loans if they’re
unable to access their money, the paper said. The Treasury may
also put pressure on banks not to call in  mortgage loans .  Officials continue to contingency plan for a range of
possible scenarios, a spokesman for the Foreign Office, who
declined to be named in line with government policy, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
