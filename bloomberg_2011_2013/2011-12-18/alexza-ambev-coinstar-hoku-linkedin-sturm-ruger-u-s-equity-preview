Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in U.S. trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, the prices are as of 4 p.m. in  New York .  A gauge of financial shares had the biggest decline among
10 industries in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The  Federal
Reserve  is expected to embrace a new global framework that
requires big banks to hold extra capital, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   fell 3.7 percent, the second-
most in the Dow Jones Industrial average, to $30.70.  Citigroup
Inc. (C)   declined 4.7 percent to $24.82.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)   retreated 4.1 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$4.99.  Commodity producers retreated on concern that demand will
decline after property prices fell in  China , the world’s top
consumer of industrial metals.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)   slumped 3.2 percent to $8.53.  Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)   slipped 3.4 percent to
$35.74.  U.S. Steel Corp. (X)   retreated 7.8 percent to $23.85.
 Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF)   tumbled 6.6 percent to
$59.71.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)   lost 7.2 percent
to $18.20.  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)   rose 2 percent to $13,
the second-biggest gain in the  S&P 500 . The cable company was
added to  Top Picks Live list at Citigroup, which said the
stock’s declines after earnings reports that missed analyst
estimates and the departures of executives were “a touch
extreme.” The company and  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  
settled a lawsuit over ads that Cablevision claimed
misrepresented its Internet speeds, a Verizon spokesman said.  Eastman Kodak Co. (EK)   dropped 20 percent to 67 cents,
the lowest price since at least 1974. The unprofitable 131-year-
old camera maker has hit some snags in its efforts to sell
patents and borrow money, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Hoku Corp. (HOKU)   fell 7.4 percent to 60 cents, the
lowest price since its August 2005 initial public offering. The
Honolulu-based energy products company said Chief Financial
Officer Darryl Nakamoto resigned, effective March 31.  Jakks Pacific Inc. (JAKK)   declined 20 percent to $13.85,
the biggest drop in the Russell 2000 Index. The toymaker reduced
its 2011 adjusted earnings and sales forecast, citing a
“difficult” retail environment for toys. Earnings will be 37
cents to 40 cents a share, compared with an earlier estimate for
$1.32 to $1.35 a share.  Schnitzer Steel Industries Inc. (SCHN)   fell 9.2 percent,
the most since Aug. 8, to $41.54. The century-old steel recycler
reported preliminary first-quarter earnings that were less than
analysts projected because of slower demand and a decline in
sales prices. Schnitzer said profit will be no more than 25
cents a share for the quarter that ended Nov. 30, compared with
the 55-cent average of nine analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  VistaPrint NV (VPRT)   dropped 7.7 percent, the most since
July 29, to $30.21. The online provider of printing services
agreed to acquire do-it-yourself homepage provider Webs Inc. for
$117.5 million. Vistaprint said the acquisition will be dilutive
to 2012 and 2013 profit excluding some items, while accretive in
2014.  Winn-Dixie Stores Inc. (WINN)   gained 70 percent to
$9.24, the biggest advance in the Russell 2000 Index. The
Jacksonville, Florida-based grocery-store chain agreed to be
acquired by Bi-Lo LLC, the owner of more than 200 supermarkets
for about $560 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
