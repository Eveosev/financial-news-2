Fondazione CRT is preparing to sell
its stakes in  France ’s  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  and  Spain ’s Banco
Sabadell SA to free up funds to subscribe to  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s
planned capital increase,  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported on its website
today, without saying where it got the information.  Fondazione CRT owns a 0.86 percent stake in Societe
Generale that would be worth 110 million euros ($143 million) at
current share prices, the Milan-based newspaper said. Fondazione
CRT owns 1 percent of Sabadell, an asset valued at 42 million
euros at current prices, Sole said. Fondazione CRT is leaning
toward selling the stakes and hasn’t set any schedule for the
sales, the business daily said.  Fondazione CRT, a Turin, Italy-based banking foundation,
directly owns a 3.3 percent stake in UniCredit and needs to
invest about 300 million euros to maintain its share at the
Italian bank’s planned capital increase, Sole said. Fondazione
CRT plans to fund the operation two-thirds through equity and
one-third through debt, the newspaper said.  Calls to a Fondazione CRT spokesperson’s office and mobile
telephones outside office hours today weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
