Prime Minister  Mario Monti â€™s
government is studying a plan to cut Italian public spending and
tax breaks by as much as 10 billion euros ($13 billion), la
Repubblica said, without saying where it got the information.  The government will set a limit for spending at 50 percent
of gross domestic product and reduce some of the 720 tax breaks
currently totaling about 253 billion euros, the Rome-based daily
reported today. Part of the proceeds from the measures will fund
a new system for unemployment benefits, Repubblica said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
