The  Milwaukee Brewers  submitted the
winning bid for Japanese center fielder Norichika Aoki and will
have a 30-day exclusive negotiating window to agree upon a
contract with the three-time batting champion.  Tsuyoshi Kinugasa, president of the Tokyo Yakult Swallows
of  Japan ’s Central League, told reporters that the Brewers’
winning bid was $2.5 million.  Aoki, 29, who had been posted by the team for auction under
the system in which Japanese players are allowed to move to
Major League Baseball, batted .292 with four home runs and 44
runs batted in last season.  He is the only player in Japanese baseball history with two
200-hit seasons and has a career average of .329 in eight
seasons with the Swallows.  Kinugasa indicated that the bid was $2.5 million (around ¥200
million).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
