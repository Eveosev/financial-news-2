The U.S. will offer 11 Swiss banks
immunity from prosecution over helping clients avoid taxes,
 SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing a person familiar with the
matter.  The banks would receive agreements similar to the one
signed with  UBS AG (UBSN)  in return for the payment of a fine,
acceptance of U.S. requests for easier legal assistance, and
providing American authorities with all of their information
about U.S. offshore business, the newspaper said.  The banks have until Dec. 20 to accept the terms in
writing, the newspaper reported. The first three will have to
provide their correspondence with U.S. clients, documents about
their U.S. business and names of their offshore bankers by Dec.
31. A spokesman for  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  declined to comment
to Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
