Iraq , the holder of the world’s
fifth-largest crude deposits, boosted oil exports 1.9 percent
this month to an average 2.175 million barrels a day, said the
director of the State Oil Marketing Organization.  The country may export at an average 2.6 million barrels a
day next year, Falah Al-Amri said in an interview yesterday.
Iraq exported 2.135 million barrels a day in November.  The government is seeking foreign investment to raise
production and exports to promote economic growth. It has
granted 15 oil and gas licenses since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion
that ousted former President  Saddam Hussein .  The country produced an average of 2.705 million barrels a
day last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Output
will rise to 3.4 million barrels of oil a day in 2012 and will
exceed 4 million barrels a day in 2014, Al-Amri said at a
conference in Baghdad yesterday.  State-run North Oil Co. is due to raise the crude output
from Kirkuk  oil fields , the country’s oldest, to 1 million
barrels a day in five years from a current level of between
600,000 barrels a day and 700,000 barrels a day, Thamir Ghadhban, chairman of the advisory commission to Iraqi Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki, told reporters yesterday.  “We have plans to raise the production capacity of oil
fields belonging to the North Oil Co., mainly the Najma and
Qaiyarah fields by  Angola ’s Sonangol SA,” Ghadhban said. “The
two fields will increase capacity by 500,000 barrels a day."  Angola’s state oil producer Sonangol won contracts last
year to develop the two fields as part of the second energy
licensing round held. The government plans another oil and gas
licensing round in March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
