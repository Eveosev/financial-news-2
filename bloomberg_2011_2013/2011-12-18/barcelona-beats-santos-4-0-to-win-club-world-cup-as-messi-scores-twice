European champion  Barcelona  beat
Brazilian club Santos 4-0 yesterday to win soccer’s FIFA Club
World Cup for a second time in three years.  Lionel Messi  got two goals in Yokohama, Japan, with Xavi Hernandez and Cesc Fabregas also scoring for the Spanish club.  “We are extremely happy and our performance, especially in
the first half, was very satisfactory,” Agence France-Presse
cited Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola as saying.  The result gives Europe a fifth straight winner in the
annual competition, which is contested by the champions of each
continent’s soccer federation. Japan’s Kashiwa Reysol also
qualified this year’s as winner of the host nation’s J League.  Brazilian teams won the first three editions of the
tournament, with AC Milan,  Manchester United  and  Inter Milan 
joining Barcelona as champions since.  Yesterday’s victory gives Barcelona a 13th title in 3 1/2
years since Guardiola was appointed, including two Champions
League successes and three La Liga crowns.  Messi gave Barcelona a 17th-minute lead with a chip over
the goalkeeper, after which Xavi then doubled the advantage
seven minutes later.  Barcelona took a three-goal lead into halftime as Fabregas
got his goal just before the interval. The Spaniards continued
to create chances in the second half and Messi completed the win
when he took the ball around the goalkeeper on 82 minutes.  Asia champion Al-Sadd of Qatar took third spot with a 5-3
win on penalty kicks against Kashiwa following a 0-0 draw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
