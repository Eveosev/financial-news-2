Swisscom Chief Executive Officer
Carsten Schloter said there won’t be any “new engagements
abroad,”  SonntagsZeitung  reported.  “We will concentrate on Switzerland and Italy in the next
five years,” Schloter was quoted as saying. “There won’t be
any new engagements abroad.”  Schloter also said that Swisscom doesn’t rule out a
partnership for Fastweb SpA, adding that a conclusion is
unlikely in the next six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
