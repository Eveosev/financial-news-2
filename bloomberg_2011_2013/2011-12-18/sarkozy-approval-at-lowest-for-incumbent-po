Nicolas Sarkozy’s approval rating is
the lowest of any outgoing French president four months ahead of
a presidential vote, Le Journal du Dimanche reported, citing an
Ifop poll.  The percentage of French voters satisfied with Sarkozy’s
presidency was 34 percent, unchanged from November, the poll
showed. Prime Minister  Francois Fillon ’s rating rose to 48
percent from 44 percent a month earlier, according to the poll.  Sarkozy’s approval rating at this point ahead of the
presidential elections compares with 52 percent for  Charles de Gaulle  in 1965, Valery Giscard d’Estaing’s 40 percent in 1980,
 Francois Mitterrand ’s 56 percent in 1987 and  Jacques Chirac ’s 54
percent in 2001, Jean-Luc Parodi, an Ifop consultant, wrote in
the newspaper.  Ifop polled 1,851 people aged 18 or more through telephone
interviews between Dec. 8 and Dec. 16, showing Sarkozy hasn’t
gained from efforts he put in to stem  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis. The 17 countries that share the euro agreed to forge a
tighter fiscal union at a summit in Brussels on Dec. 9. Sarkozy
has attempted to position himself for a 2012 re-election
campaign as the most credible candidate on economic matters.  A separate Ifop poll for the JDD on Dec. 16 showed that
Marine Le Pen, leader of  France ’s anti-euro National Front, is
gaining support as backing for Sarkozy and Socialist candidate
Francois Hollande stalls.  About 20 percent would back Le Pen if an election were held
now, up from 19 percent a month ago and 17 percent in October,
according to the poll. Support for Sarkozy has dropped to 24
percent from 26 percent a month ago and backing for Hollande has
declined to 27.5 percent from 32.5 percent, the poll showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
