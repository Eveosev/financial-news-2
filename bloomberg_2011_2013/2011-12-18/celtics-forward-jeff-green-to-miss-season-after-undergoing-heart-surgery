Boston Celtics  forward  Jeff Green 
will undergo heart surgery next month and will miss the entire
2011-12 National Basketball Association season, the team said.  During a routine physical on Dec. 9, doctors detected an
aortic aneurysm in Green’s heart. After additional testing by a
team of cardiac specialists, surgery was recommended, the team
said in a statement on its  website .  The Celtics signed Green, 25, to a one-year, $9 million
contract last week. His contract was voided due to the failed
physical. The Celtics retain his rights if he is able to return,
ESPN reported.  “While we are saddened that Jeff will not be able to play
this season, the most important thing is his health, and we were
fortunate to have access to an amazing team of specialists to
evaluate Jeff’s case,” Celtics President Danny Ainge said.
“The entire Celtics family supports Jeff during this difficult
time in his career.”  An  aortic aneurysm  is the bulging of the wall of the aorta,
the largest blood vessel in the body. The condition can be fatal
if the aorta ruptures.  Green averaged 9.8 points and 3.3 rebounds last season
after joining the Celtics in a trade that sent Kendrick Perkins
to the Oklahoma City Thunder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
