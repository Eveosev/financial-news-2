The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations fell 5.25 cents to $3.2393 a
gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The price decline covers the two-week period ended Dec. 16
and is based on the company’s survey of about 2,500 stations.  “Unknowns about the European debt crisis seem to have made
 oil prices  skittish, and it is the cause of continued declines
at the pump,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey in
Camarillo,  California , said yesterday in a telephone interview.
“The U.S. gasoline market continues to receive down pressure
from falling gasoline demand.”  Gasoline for January delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 12.92 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $2.487 a gallon in
the two weeks ended Dec. 16.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  jumped 3.82 million barrels to
218.8 million in the week ended Dec. 9, the highest level since
March, the Energy Department reported Dec. 14. Inventories have
risen 14.7 million barrels, or 7.2 percent, in five weeks of
gains.  Measured on a four-week average,  demand , or deliveries to
wholesalers, was 4.5 percent below a year earlier, compared with
a 3.5 percent deficit the prior week. The four-week average of
total fuel supplied was 5.6 percent below 2010.  Declining Demand  Gasoline demand at the pump in the week ended Dec. 9 was
8.76 million barrels a day, down 4.6 percent from a year
earlier, according to MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse report on
Dec. 13. Year-to-date demand is down 1.6 percent from a year
earlier.  The front-month crude oil contract declined $7.43, or 7.4
percent, in the two weeks ended Dec. 16 to settle at $93.53.  Crude prices may fall this week on expectation that the
European debt crisis will worsen and reduce fuel demand.  Nine of 17 analysts, or 53 percent, forecast oil will slide
through Dec. 23. Six respondents, or 35 percent, predicted a
gain and two estimated there will be little change. Last week,
41 percent of surveyed analysts projected a drop.  Crude oil  supplies  fell 1.93 million barrels to 334.2
million in the week ended Dec. 9, according to the Energy
Department.  Inventories  at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for New York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil, rose 83,000
barrels to 31.2 million.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline averaged $3.55 a gallon in
the latest survey, Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail
stations averaged $3.52 a gallon.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed was in  San Francisco , where customers paid an
average of $3.57 a gallon. The lowest price was in  Albuquerque ,
 New Mexico , where a gallon averaged $2.83, Lundberg said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
