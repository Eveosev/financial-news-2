The  Green Bay Packers â€™ attempt to go
undefeated ended today in  Kansas City , where the Chiefs won
19-14 to beat the  Super Bowl  champions.  The Packers (13-1) had not lost in almost a full calendar
year, having won 19 in a row since a 31-27 loss at  New England 
on Dec. 19, 2010.  The Chiefs (6-8), who six days ago fired coach Todd Haley,
got four field goals from Ryan Succop and a 1-yard scoring run
in the fourth quarter from Jackie Battle.  The 1972  Miami Dolphins  remain the last National Football
League team to go undefeated through an entire season.  While the Packers were losing their first game of the
season, the  Indianapolis Colts  were winning their first by
defeating the Tennessee Titans 27-13.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
