Saudi Arabia , OPEC’s largest oil
producer, decreased output by less than one percent in October
from a month earlier as it adjusted production to meet
fluctuations in customers’ demand, government data showed.  The kingdom pumped 9.36 million barrels a day, down 0.85
percent from 9.44 million barrels in September, according to the
data the government submitted to the Joint Organization Data
Initiative.  The country exported 7.08 million barrels of crude oil a
day in the month, up from 6.81 million barrels a day in
September, statistics posted today on the initiative’s  website .
The Saudi crude data includes condensates and excludes natural-
gas liquids, according to the website.  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi said on Oct.8 that
there is no excess supply in world oil markets and that the
kingdom has been adjusting output to match fluctuating demand
over recent months.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signaled
in its meeting in Vienna on Dec. 14 that it’s prepared to allow
Saudi Arabia, the biggest member, to keep pumping crude at near
the highest rate in at least 30 years, while increasing its
combined output limit to 30 million barrels a day.  JODI is supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum and compiles data supplied by member governments. The IEF
is a group of nations that account for more than 90 percent of
global oil and gas supply and demand, established as a forum for
producing and consuming nations to discuss international  energy
security .  To contact the reporter on this story:
