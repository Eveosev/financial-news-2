Vaclav Havel, the Czech playwright
and dissident who helped lead his nation’s uprising against
Communism in 1989 and later became the country’s president, died
today at age 75, state television station CT1 reported.  He passed away in his sleep after a long illness, Havel’s
secretary, Sabina Tancevova, told Czech News Agency.  “He did a lot for the  Czech Republic , for its transition
to democracy, to the structures of the European Union,” said
Prime Minister Peter Necas in a televised statement.  Havel in recent months has kept out of the public,
canceling many events, because of failing health. Earlier this
month, he met with his long-time friend, the Dalai Lama, who
came to  Prague .  To contact the reporter on this story:
