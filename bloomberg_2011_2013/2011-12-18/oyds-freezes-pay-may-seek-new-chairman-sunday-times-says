Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  has frozen
pay for its top 1,000 executives, including Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio, the  Sunday Times reported,  citing
investors it didn’t name.  The bank cut bonuses by at least 10 percent and may discuss
a replacement for Chairman Win Bischoff, who turns 71 next year,
the newspaper reported. The bank is expected to write off 10
billion pounds ($15.6 billion) of bad debts next year, taking
the total since 2008 to 50 billion pounds, the Times said.  Nicole Sharp, a Lloyds spokeswoman in London, declined to
comment on the pay freeze or Bischoff’s replacement when
contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
