Iran  needs an annual $300 billion in
foreign direct investment to meet its objective of 8 percent
economic growth by 2015,  Tehran Times  reported, citing Deputy
Economy Minister Behrouz Alishiri.  The country attracted about $15 billion in foreign
investment last year, the newspaper cited Alishiri as saying.  Economic growth was 4 percent in the last Iranian calendar
year that ended March 20, Economy Minister Shamseddin Hosseini
said in October, according to the Tehran-based daily newspaper.  Iran is under four rounds of United Nations sanctions and
separate punitive measures imposed by the  United States  and the
European Union due to its nuclear program which have curbed
international investments. The  International Monetary Fund  is
forecasting 2.5 percent growth this year compared with 3.2
percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
