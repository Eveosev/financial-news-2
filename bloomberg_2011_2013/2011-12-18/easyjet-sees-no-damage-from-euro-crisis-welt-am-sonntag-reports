EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  Chief Executive Officer
Carolyn McCall said the sovereign-debt crisis has had no effect
on  Europe ’s second-largest low-cost airline, Welt am Sonntag
reported.  People “don’t seem to be willing to let events in Brussels
ruin their summer holidays,” McCall told the German newspaper
in an interview. “Of course, that could change any day.”  The low-cost carrier seeks to increase the proportion of
its passengers travelling on business to between 20 percent and
23 percent in the next five years, up from about 18 percent
today, she said. EasyJet has hedged its kerosene needs for the
coming months to 80 percent against rising oil prices, she told
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
