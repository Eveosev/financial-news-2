Thailand  has recorded about $2
billion of inflows stemming from insurance claims related to
this year’s floods, Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn
Trairatvorakul said.  The fund inflows have been balanced by outflows linked to
overseas investment by Thai companies and the sale of emerging
market assets by overseas investors, Prasarn told reporters
today in Hua Hin, Thailand.  Affected companies will start buying replacement machinery
in the first quarter, boosting capital outflows, Prasarn said.
The impact on the baht may be limited as some companies have
opened foreign currency deposit accounts for insurance claims,
and those funds won’t be converted into baht. Other claims may
be paid to parent companies outside Thailand, he said.  “These two methods won’t have any impact on the baht,”
Prasarn said. The baht is expected to be volatile next year
because of global economic uncertainties, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
