Metal demand in  China , the biggest
consumer of copper and aluminum, may grow at a slower pace in
2012 and prices may be lower than this year, Wang Huajun, deputy
secretary-general of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry
Association.  “It is unlikely to see metals demand to grow at more than
10 percent next year,” given the macroeconomic environment,
Wang said at a forum in  Shanghai . He did not give comparative
figures for this year.  Slower China demand may further pressure metals prices,
which have fallen 23 percent this year on the London Metal
Exchange LMEX Index,  the first decline since 2008. (LMEX)  Commodities
are set for a “difficult environment” in 2012 amid a possible
dissolution of the European Union and a “hard landing” in
China, UBS AG said Nov. 30.  Refined copper demand may increase 6 percent, while primary
aluminum consumption may grow 8 percent, he said. Lead and zinc
consumption may rise by 7 percent and 5 percent, respectively,
Wang said.  Imports of  copper  dropped 9.7 percent through November,
according to customs data. China’s foreign trade faces
“severe” challenges next year, Wang Shouwen, head of the
Commerce Ministry’s foreign trade department, said on Dec. 7.  China’s economy  will grow 8.5 percent next year, the least
in 11 years and down from 10.4 percent in 2010, according to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. A reading
of 49 for a purchasing managers’ index reported by HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics Dec. 15 indicated China’s manufacturing
may contract for a second month. The dividing line between
contraction and expansion is 50.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
