England’s  Lee Westwood  won golf’s
Thailand Open by seven shots for his second title this month,
while countryman  Ian Poulter  had a three-stroke win at the
Australian Masters.  Westwood, 38, will climb one spot to No. 2 in the  Official
World Golf Ranking  following his 37th career victory, the Asian
Tour said on its website.  “I’ve amazed myself really,” Westwood told the British
Broadcasting Corp. “It’s been staggering. It’s probably the
best I’ve ever played.”  Westwood finished on 22-under-par 266 at the Amata Spring
Golf Course in Chonburi, with Masters Tournament champion Charl Schwartzel of South Africa on 15-under. Michael Thompson of the
U.S. was third, one shot further back.  In Melbourne, Poulter carded 15-under for the tournament,
with  Australia ’s Marcus Fraser on 12-under. Geoff Ogilvy of
Australia was another shot behind.  England’s Luke Donald, who was this week named as the
player of the year by both the European Tour and U.S. PGA Tour,
finished on 4-under.  The 34-year-old topped the money lists on the American and
European circuits, the only player to achieve the feat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
