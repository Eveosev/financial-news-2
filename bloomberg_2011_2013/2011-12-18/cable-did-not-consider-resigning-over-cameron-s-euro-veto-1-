U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said he didn’t consider resigning from the coalition government
following Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s refusal to back a
European accord to promote a greater fiscal union.  Asked if he considered resigning, he said, “No” in an
interview on  BBC  television.  “I frequently wonder about my position in government,
because we’re all making difficult decisions,” Cable told the
“Marr” program. “When I reflect on it, what were committed to
is making this government work. We’ve got to work together to
solve this massive economic crisis.”  The U.K. government will accept the Independent Commission
on Banking’s report “in full,” Cable also told the BBC.  “We are going to proceed with the separation of the banks,
the casinos and the retail business lending parts of banks,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
