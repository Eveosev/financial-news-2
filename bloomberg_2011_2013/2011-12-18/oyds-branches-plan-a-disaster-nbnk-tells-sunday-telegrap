A sale of  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s
632 bank branches to the Co-Operative Banking Group would be a
“disaster,” the Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported, citing
Gary Hoffman, chief executive of  NBNK Investments Plc. (NBNK)   Lloyds made the “wrong decision” to pick Co-Operative as
the preferred bidder after rival NBNK offered guarantees to
protect jobs at the bank branches, Hoffman said.  The Co-Operative said Hoffman’s comments had “no
fundamental foundation,” the Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
