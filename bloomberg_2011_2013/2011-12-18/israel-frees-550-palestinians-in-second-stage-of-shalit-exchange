Israel  freed 550 Palestinian
prisoners in the second stage of an agreement with the Islamic
Hamas movement for the release of captured soldier Gilad Shalit.  Most of the prisoners were released to an area of the  West
Bank  controlled by the Palestinian Authority while 41 were sent
to the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, the Israeli Prison Service said
today in an e-mailed statement. Two prisoners were sent to
Israeli-controlled east Jerusalem while the remaining two were
sent to Jordan, it said.  Shalit was freed Oct. 18 in the first stage of the exchange
in which Israel released 477 prisoners. The Israeli soldier was
seized five years ago by Palestinian militants from a tank
stationed outside Gaza and held captive inside the small coastal
territory.  Hamas and Fatah, the secular movement led by  Palestinian
Authority  President Mahmoud Abbas, were scheduled to hold talks
in Cairo today aimed at mending a four-year rift and governing
together in the West Bank and Gaza.  Hamas, which won parliamentary elections in 2006, seized
control of Gaza while Abbas purged Hamas members from the West
Bank leadership. Hamas is considered a terrorist group by the
U.S., the European Union and Israel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
