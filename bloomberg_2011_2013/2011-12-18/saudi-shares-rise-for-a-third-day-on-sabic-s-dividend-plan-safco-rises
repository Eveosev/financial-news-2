Saudi Arabian’s benchmark stock
index rose for a third day, its longest winning streak in two
months, after  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC)  proposed paying the
highest annual cash dividend since 2005.  Saudi Basic, also known as Sabic, is the world’s largest
petrochemicals maker and accounts for 12 percent of the Saudi
benchmark index. The shares jumped the most in two weeks.  Dar Al
Arkan Real Estate Development Co. (ALARKAN)  climbed for a fifth day. The
 Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 0.2 percent to 6,267.38 at 2:26
p.m. in Riyadh. It’s up 1.3 percent over the past three days,
the longest streak of gains since the four days ended Oct. 10.
Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  added 0.4 percent.  “The Saudi market is gaining on Sabic’s dividend,” which
is stirring optimism about upcoming earnings releases at other
Saudi companies, said Dubai-based Ibrahim Masood, who helps
manage about $400 million at  Mashreqbank PSC. (MASQ)   The board of Riyadh-based Sabic recommended a second-half
dividend of 3 riyals a share after paying 2 riyals for the first
six months. That made the 2011 cash dividend the company’s
highest since 2005, according to data posted on the Saudi  bourse
website . The company beat earnings estimates in October as
petrochemical demand grew in China and  India .  Sabic advanced as much as 2.4 percent, the most since Dec.
5, to 96 riyals, before trading at 95 riyals. Dar Al Arkan rose
1.4 percent to 7.2 riyals.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of equities in the Gulf region
strengthened 0.3 percent and Kuwait’s  key index (KWSEIDX)  rose 0.2
percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  fell for a fifth day,
slipping less than 0.1 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  lost 0.1
percent, while Qatar’s and Bahrain’s bourses were closed for a
national holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
