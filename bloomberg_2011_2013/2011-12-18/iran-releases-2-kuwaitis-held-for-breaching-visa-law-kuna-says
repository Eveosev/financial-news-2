Two Kuwaitis who were detained last
month by Iranian authorities for violating tourist visa rules
were released, state-run  KUNA  reported.  Raed al-Majed and Aedl al-Yahya were flown back home, the
 news agency  cited  Kuwait ’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh
Sabah Khaled al-Sabah as saying.  Iranian ambassador to Kuwait, Ruhollah Ghahremani, said the
espionage charges the Kuwaitis faced were “incorrect,”
according to Iran’s state-run news agency  Mehr . They “acted
against the law” when they “attempted to do journalistic and
reporting work” while entering Iran on tourist visas, he said,
according to the news agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
