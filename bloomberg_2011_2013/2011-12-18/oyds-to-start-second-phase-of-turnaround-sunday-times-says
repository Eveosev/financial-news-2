Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  will start
the “second phase” of its turnaround plan after Chief
Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio returns from medical
leave, the Sunday Times said, citing an interview with the CEO.  The bank will accelerate its turnaround to allow Horta-
Osorio to focus on “other priorities” and delegate more of his
workload, the CEO was quoted as saying, without providing
details.  Lloyds is in “a much stronger position” after the CEO
hired senior managers and led the bank’s response to the
Independent Commission on Banking, Horta-Osorio told the Times.  “With hindsight, I should have gone slower,” the
executive was quoted as saying. “I was quite concerned that we
would have sovereign debt contagion that would be very
threatening to banks. That became a reality, and now we are
facing a double dip.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
