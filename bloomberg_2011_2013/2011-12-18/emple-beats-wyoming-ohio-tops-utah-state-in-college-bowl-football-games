quarter. Utah State fell to 7-5 with the loss.  In  Las Vegas ,  Nevada , Brett Baer kicked a 50-yard field
goal with four seconds remaining as the University of
Louisianna-Lafayette Ragin’ Cajuns (9-4) won their first bowl
game with a 32-30 upset of  San Diego  State University.  Baer’s kick came after San Diego (8-5) quarterback Ryan
Lindley capped a 10-play, 69-yard drive with a 12-yard touchdown
pass to Colin Lockett with 35 seconds remaining, giving the
Aztecs (8-5) a brief 30-29 lead.  It was the Aztecs’ final game before leaving the Mountain
