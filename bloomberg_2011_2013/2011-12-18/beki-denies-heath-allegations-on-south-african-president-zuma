South Africa ’s former president,
 Thabo Mbeki , denied claims by the former head of the country’s
anti-corruption unit that he had directed prosecutors to charge
 Jacob Zuma  for corruption and rape.  Willem Heath, who resigned Dec. 15 after two weeks as head
of the Special Investigations Unit, made the accusation in an
interview with Johannesburg-based City Press newspaper Dec. 4.  "All the allegations made by Heath are false, malicious and
defamatory," Mbeki wrote in an opinion piece in the newspaper
today. "I am ready to defend this assertion in any forum."  The former judge left the Special Investigations Unit after
Zuma, the country’s president, instructed his office to
investigate the “facts and circumstances surrounding” the
interview. Justice Minister  Jeff Radebe  and Heath agreed that it
would be “untenable” for him to continue in his role,
according to Radebe’s spokesman Tlali Tlali.  Zuma, who ousted Mbeki as leader of the ruling African
National Congress in 2007, was acquitted on rape charges in
2006. Corruption charges against him were dropped in 2009, weeks
before he became president. Heath advised Zuma during his
corruption trial. He left as head of the Special Investigations
Unit more than a decade ago after Mbeki excluded him from
investigating a multibillion-rand arms purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
