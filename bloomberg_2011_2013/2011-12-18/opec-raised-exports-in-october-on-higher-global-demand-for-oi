OPEC  members led by  Saudi Arabia 
increased exports of crude oil in October from a month earlier
to meet higher global demand, according to the data the
governments submitted to the Joint Organization Data Initiative.  Kuwait, the group’s fourth-largest producer, increased
exports to 2.14 million barrels a day in October, the data
showed. This is the highest monthly figure since at least
January 2002 when the country started submitting data to the
initiative known as  JODI .  Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, increased its exports by 270,000
barrels a day, or 4 percent, in October to 7.08 million barrels
a day, the data showed. Angola,  Nigeria , and  Venezuela  also
raised exports during the month, the data showed.  OPEC decided on Dec. 14 to increase its product ceiling to
30 million barrels a day, the first change in three years,
moving the group’s target nearer to current output as it
grapples with rising exports from postwar  Libya .  OPEC will need to produce 30.1 million barrels a day next
year to balance world supply and demand, its secretariat
forecast last week in its monthly report. World oil demand will
rise 1.1 million barrels a day, or 1.2 percent, in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
