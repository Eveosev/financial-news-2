Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd. (BEN)  shares
fell the most in almost four months in Sydney after the company
increased the size of its equity sale to fund the purchase of
 Bank of Cyprus Plc (BOCY) ’s Australian unit.  The Bendigo, Australia-based bank sold A$150 million ($149
million) of stock, more than the A$120 million it announced last
week, at A$8.45 apiece, it said in a statement today. The
shares, which resumed trading today after being halted at A$9 on
Dec. 15, fell 5.1 percent to A$8.54 at 10:53 a.m., the most
since Aug. 29.  Bendigo & Adelaide said last week it agreed to pay A$130
million for Bank of Cyprus Australia Ltd., which has 14 branches
in New South Wales,  Australia ’s most populous state, as well as
Victoria and  South Australia . The Hellenic lender’s unit has
interest-bearing assets of A$1.4 billion. The acquisition is due
to be completed by the end of February, subject to regulatory
approval.  While the purchase of Cyprus Australia is “an expensive
deal that relies on large synergy benefits for accretion, we
think it is more about the capital raising than the deal
itself,” Deutsche Bank AG analysts in Sydney including Andrew
Triggs wrote in a note to clients dated Dec. 16. They have a
“hold” rating on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
