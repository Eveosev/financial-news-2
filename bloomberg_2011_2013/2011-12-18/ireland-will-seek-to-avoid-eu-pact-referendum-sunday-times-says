Ireland’s  government  will seek to
avoid holding a referendum on the European Union’s new fiscal
pact by putting budget-deficit rules into Irish law rather than
amending the constitution, the  Sunday Times  said, citing
unidentified government officials.  Ireland must hold a national vote on any changes to the
country’s constitution. The government will also oppose any new
rules on taxation in inter-governmental talks in January and
February, the newspaper reported in its Irish edition today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
