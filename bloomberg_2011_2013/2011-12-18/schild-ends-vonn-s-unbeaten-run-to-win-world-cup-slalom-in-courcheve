Austria ’s Marlies Schild won the
women’s slalom in Courchevel, France, to end a run of four
straight World Cup victories for  Lindsey Vonn .  Schild, 30, the defending slalom world champion, clocked 1
minute, 42.64 seconds over two runs today to beat Finland’s
Tanja Poutiainen by 1.87 seconds. Austria’s Kathrin Zettel was
third.  Vonn failed to qualify for the second leg after veering off
the course on her first run. The 27-year-old American came into
the event after a Super-G victory in Beaver Creek, Colorado, and
a sweep of three races in Lake Louise, Canada.  Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch, last season’s overall World
Cup champion, fell on the second leg today.  Home favorite Massimiliano Blardone finished ahead of
Austria’s Hannes Reichelt and Philipp Schorghofer in today’s
men’s giant slalom in Alta Badia,  Italy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
