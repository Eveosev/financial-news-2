  Sports Direct International Plc (SPD) , the
U.K.â€™s biggest sporting goods retailer, said it got a 220
million-pound ($355 million) loan to refinance an existing
facility.  Sports Direct agreed to pay initial interest of 175 basis
points over the  London  interbank offered rate on the new three-
year borrowing, the Mansfield, England-based company said in a
statement. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  HSBC Holdings Plc, Barclays Capital and Svenska
Handelsbanken AB led a group of 10 banks providing the
financing, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
