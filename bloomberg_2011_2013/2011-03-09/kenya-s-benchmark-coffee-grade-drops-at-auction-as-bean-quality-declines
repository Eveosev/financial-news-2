  Kenya ’s benchmark coffee dropped 5.4
percent at an auction yesterday after the quality of the beans
declined and some buyers stayed away from the auction, the
Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The top Arabica AA type sold for an average of $447.52 for
a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, compared with $472.83 a week
earlier, the agency said in an e-mailed statement from Nairobi,
the capital. Supplies of the grade climbed 0.9 percent to 4,556
bags, it said.  The price for all coffee sold slipped 2.5 percent to
$345.14 a bag from, as supplies fell 2 percent to 16,758 bags,
the agency said. Total sales increased 15 percent to 10,110 bags
worth $4.27 million as buyers replenished their stocks as the
close of the auction season draws closer, the exchange said.  The country may close its seasonal auctions as early as
April amid low stocks, Samuel Thuo, a program manager at the
Nairobi-based Coffee Management Services, said on Feb. 15.  Kenya’s coffee production in the 12 months through
September may drop 27 percent 40,000 metric tons from a previous
forecast of 49,000 to 55,000 tons, James Wahome, the quality
manager at the Coffee Board of Kenya said on Jan. 17. The
country produced 45,000 tons last season.  Kenya harvests the bulk of its crop from October through
December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to June.
