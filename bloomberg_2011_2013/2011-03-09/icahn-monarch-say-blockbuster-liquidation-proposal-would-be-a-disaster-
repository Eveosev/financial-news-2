  Blockbuster Inc. (BLOAQ)  note holders who
are also lenders to the company in bankruptcy said they support
the sale and oppose the liquidation motion.  The group, which
calls itself a “steering group” includes Icahn Capital LP,
Monarch Alternative Capital LP, Owl Creek Asset Management L.P.,
Stonehill Capital Management LLC, and Värde
Partners, Inc.  “The premature conversion to a chapter 7 liquidation at
this stage would be a disaster for all constituents, causing
further harm to the Debtors’ businesses and deterioration to
the value of the Debtors’ assets,’ ’ the group wrote in court
papers filed today.  The senior secured noteholders have a lien on $630 million
on all of Blockbuster’s remaining property and its unlikely
other creditors will receive a distribution in a liquidation. In
a sale, Blockbuster will pay another $285 million to those
groups, the noteholders said.  Blockbuster has made payments of $845 million to its
vendors, employees, movie studio partners and  ‘‘virtually every
other constituency” except for the noteholders since the start
of its bankruptcy, the group said. By contrast, the noteholders
haven’t been paid for proceeds from liquidating 900 stores, they
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
