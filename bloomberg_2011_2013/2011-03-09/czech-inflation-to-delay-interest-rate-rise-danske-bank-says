Czech inflation data released today
allows policy makers to delay raising  interest rates , according
to Copenhagen-based Danske Bank A/S.  The Czech inflation rate rose to 1.8 percent in February
from 1.7 percent in January, the  statistics office  said. That
was less than the 2 percent median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg, and also lower then the central bank’s
forecast of 2.1 percent.  “The combination of the low inflationary environment and
subdued economic activity this year puts the Czech central bank
in a position where it can afford to keep low interest rates for
longer,” analyst Stanislava Pravdova at Danske Bank wrote in a
report to clients. “This could put some weakening pressure on
the koruna on a one- to three-month horizon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
