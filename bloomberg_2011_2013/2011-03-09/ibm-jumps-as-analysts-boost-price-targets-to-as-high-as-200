  International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  jumped 2.2 percent in New York trading after seven
analysts boosted their price targets for the company, including
one who predicted the shares will reach $200.  Chris Whitmore, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, raised his
price target for the stock 14 percent to $200, saying IBM’s
analyst meeting yesterday made the company’s profit targets seem
“conservative.” He’s now one of eight analysts tracked by
Bloomberg projecting the shares will reach at least $180.  At yesterday’s meeting, IBM reiterated its goals of almost
doubling per-share operating earnings to at least $20 and
increasing sales by about $20 billion by 2015. The company is
being conservative on revenue growth and how much it will be
able to eliminate in expenses, Whitmore wrote in a note to
clients yesterday.  “We believe there is ample flexibility for IBM to beat this
target and expect investors to place a larger premium on IBM’s
earnings stream as confidence in this goal increases,” said San
Francisco-based Whitmore, who maintained his “buy” rating on the
company’s shares.  IBM said it sees $8 billion in cost savings through 2015
and is assuming only $3 billion of that in its profit target,
Whitmore wrote. The company could see about $25 in operating
earnings per share in 2015, he said.  IBM, based in Armonk,  New York , rose $3.58 to $165.86 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the steepest
jump since Jan. 24. The shares have climbed 13 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
