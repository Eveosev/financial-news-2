The New Zealand dollar fell after
the central bank cut its overnight cash rate by 0.5 percentage
point to help the economy recover from the nationâ€™s deadliest
earthquake in 80 years.  The currency slid to 73.57 U.S. cents as of 9:01 a.m. in
Wellington from 73.88 cents before the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
