Poland’s WIG20 Index advanced 7.22,
or 0.3 percent, to 2,801.95 at 1:02 p.m. in Warsaw, heading for
the sixth consecutive daily gain.  The following are among the most active stocks on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.    Central European Distribution Corp. (CEDC)   climbed for a
second day, adding 0.9 zloty, or 2.4 percent, to 37.9 zloty.
UniCredit SpA maintained its “buy” recommendation for the
vodka producer after its shares slumped more than 40 percent
since the release of 2010 results last week.    KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, increased for the first time in
four days, climbing 2.6 zloty, 1.5 percent, to 178.9 zloty.
Copper rose after  oil prices  fell, easing concern about a
potential slowdown of the global economic recovery that might
curb demand for metals.    Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , Poland’s second-largest refiner,
retreated for the first time in six days, sliding as much as 1.7
percent to 42.55 zloty and last trading 0.6 percent lower at
43.04 zloty. Oil dropped as speculation mounted that OPEC will
consider boosting output to compensate for disruptions in Libya
and as rising U.S. supplies signaled weakening demand.    Bank Pekao SA (PEO)   declined 2.5 zloty, or 1.5 percent,
to 170.5 zloty, heading for the steepest one-day drop in two
weeks. Poland’s second-largest bank said fourth-quarter profit
was 643.7 million zloty ($225 million), missing the 705.1
million-zloty average estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
