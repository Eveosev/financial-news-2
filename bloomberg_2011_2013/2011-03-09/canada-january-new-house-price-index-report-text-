The following is the text of
the new house price index report for January released by  Statistics Canada .  The New Housing Price Index (NHPI) rose 0.2% in January
following a 0.1% advance in December.  Toronto and Oshawa, as well as Montréal were the top
contributors to the NHPI increase in January.  Between December and January, prices increased the most in
Winnipeg (+0.7%), followed by Québec (+0.5%), Toronto and
Oshawa, and Montréal (both up 0.4%).  In Winnipeg, prices rose as a result of builders introducing new
list prices in January.  In Toronto and Oshawa, builders reported increased prices as a
result of good market conditions.  In Québec and Montréal, the increases were mainly attributed to
higher material and labour costs.  Price decreases were recorded in the Saint John, Fredericton and
Moncton metropolitan regions aggregation, as well as in Hamilton
(both down 0.2%) and  Edmonton  (-0.1%).  In Saint John, Fredericton and Moncton, slower market conditions
caused builders to reduce their prices in order to stimulate
sales.  In Hamilton, as well as in Edmonton, builders reported lower
negotiated selling prices in January.  Year over year, the NHPI was up 1.9% in January following a 2.1%
increase in December.  The main contributors to the year-over-year increase of the NHPI
in January were the metropolitan regions of Toronto and Oshawa,
Montréal and Ottawa-Gatineau.  For the third month in a row, the largest year-over-year
increase was recorded in St. John’s (+6.2%).  Compared with January 2010, contractors’ selling prices were
also higher in Regina (+6.0%) and Winnipeg (+5.9%).  Among the 21 metropolitan regions surveyed, 5 registered 12-
month declines in January: Windsor (-3.7%), Charlottetown (-
1.9%), Greater Sudbury and Thunder Bay (-1.1%), Victoria (-1.0%)
and St. Catharines-Niagara (-0.8%).  Note: The New Housing Price Index measures changes over time in
the selling prices of new residential houses agreed upon between
the contractor and the buyer at the time of the signing of the
contract. It is designed to measure the changes in the selling
prices of new houses where detailed specifications pertaining to
each house remain the same between two consecutive periods. The
prices collected from builders and included in the index are
market selling prices less value added taxes, such as the
Federal Goods and Services Tax or the Harmonized Sales Tax.  This release presents data that are not seasonally adjusted and
the indexes published are final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
