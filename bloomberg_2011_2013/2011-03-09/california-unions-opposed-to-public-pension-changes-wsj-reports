A coalition of several state-workers
unions are opposed to some public-pension changes now being
considered by Gov.  Jerry Brown , the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing a letter the group plans to send to Brown and
state legislative leaders.  The group, Californians for Healthcare and Retirement
Security, represents teachers, police, firefighters, state
workers and others, the newspaper said.  Their opposition to Brown’s plans may make it more
difficult for the governor to find a compromise with Republican
lawmakers on the state’s $26.6 billion  budget deficit , the
Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
