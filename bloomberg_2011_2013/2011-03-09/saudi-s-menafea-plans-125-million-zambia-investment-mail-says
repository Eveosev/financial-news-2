Menafea Holdings Ltd. will invest
$125 million in a Zambian pineapple farm and in housing in the
capital, Lusaka, the  Daily Mail  said, citing company board
member Khaled Alrajhi.  The Saudi company will develop a 5,000 hectare (12,400
acre) pineapple farm in the North Western Province, where it
will also build a fruit-processing plant, the Lusaka-based
newspaper said on its website. Menafea also plans to build 2,000
homes in Lusaka, the  Daily Mail  reported, citing Alrajhi.  Both investments have been approved by Zambia’s investment
promotion agency, said the Mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
