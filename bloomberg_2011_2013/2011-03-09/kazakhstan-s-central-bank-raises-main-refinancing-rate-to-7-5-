  Kazakhstan ’s central bank raised the
main refinancing rate to 7.5 percent from 7 percent, effective
today, according to a statement issued in Almaty today.  “After March we will discuss whether to leave the
refinancing rate where it is or move further,” Kazakhstan’s
central bank Chairman Grigori Marchenko told reporters in Almaty
today. The central bank may also consider a change of its
inflation forecast of as much as 8 percent, he said.  The National Bank of Kazakhstan is loosening currency
controls and allowing the tenge to appreciate to help contain
inflation that accelerated last month to 8.8 percent, the
fastest since April 2009. The regulator will favor currency
gains over interest-rate increases to help keep price growth
within its target range of 6 to 8 percent, Citigroup Inc. said
March 1.  “We won’t let the tenge appreciate significantly,”
Marchenko said today, declining to elaborate. Kazakhstan bought
$.5.5 billion from the beginning of this year to stem tenge
gains, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
