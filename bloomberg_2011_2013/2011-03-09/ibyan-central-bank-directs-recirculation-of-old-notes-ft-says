The Libyan Central Bank in Tripoli
has instructed banks to put old currency back into circulation
as the country faces liquidity challenges amid international
efforts to freeze its regime’s assets, the Financial Times said,
citing officials at the central bank’s office in Benghazi.  The central bank and commercial banks still had stocks of
‘fourth and fifth issue“ dinars that had been taken out of
circulation at the end of March 2010, the FT said. These notes
are now being considered legal tender again, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
