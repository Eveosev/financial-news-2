For Douglas Johnson, the number six
says it all. That was how many  California  Hispanics were in
Congress in 2000, accounting for 11 percent of 53 U.S. House
seats, and that’s how many are there today.  “There was a bipartisan effort to keep all the incumbents
safe and the emerging populations quiet,” said Johnson, a  Rose
Institute of State and Local Government  fellow at  Claremont
McKenna College  in Claremont, California. “And it worked.”  It may be different in the next Congress. Voters in
November took the job of redistricting away from politicians and
gave it to a citizen panel, meaning lawmakers in 2012 will have
to compete in constituencies not designed to keep them in
office. The state didn’t grow enough between 2000 and 2010 to
earn another House seat, so some districts may have to be
consolidated to accommodate population shifts.  The most sweeping gains in census data released yesterday -
- by Hispanics and Asians, and by counties far from the  Pacific
Ocean  -- may send political power eastward.  “Latinos are moving into the suburbs,” said Tony Quinn,
an editor of the  California Target Book , a nonpartisan political
guide. “It’s going to affect Republican seats that have been
safe for a decade.”  While California added people at a slightly faster pace
than the nation between 2000 and 2010, its 10 percent growth
rate was the lowest in the state’s history. The population
increased to 37,253,956 from 33,871,648.  Majority Minority  Non-Hispanic Asians were the fastest-expanding group,
rising 30.9 percent to 4,775,070, or 12.8 percent of all
residents, according the  U.S. Census Bureau .  The Hispanic population climbed 27.8 percent to 14,013,719,
or 37.6 percent of the total. Non-Hispanic whites declined 5.4
percent to 14,956,253, or 40.1 percent, as blacks fell 0.8
percent to 2,163,804, or 5.8 percent.  While the counties that gained the most people between 2000
and 2010 have traditionally voted Republican, the groups that
advanced the fastest are typically Democrats,  Johnson  said. The
census found 27 majority minority counties -- with Hispanics,
Asians and blacks outnumbering whites -- up from 18 in 2000.  Because of such demographic shifts, and the new method for
drawing electoral maps, Johnson said that California “will see
five to 10 members of the congressional delegation retired.”  Driveway U-Hauls  The shapes of California’s 120 state legislative and 53
congressional districts won’t be known until the  Citizens
Redistricting Commission  completes its blueprint on Aug. 15.  California  has 34 Democrats and 19 Republicans in the
House; 40 of them are white, six are Hispanic, four are black
and three are Asian. The two U.S. senators are white Democrats.  “Our population has shifted, our representation has not,”
said Tony Mendoza, a Democratic state assemblyman from Artesia,
in Los Angeles County, and head of the California Latino
Legislative Caucus. “We’re going to see more representation by
folks who haven’t traditionally been elected.”  With a new map coming, Mendoza said the joke in the capitol
in  Sacramento  is that “everyone’s got a U-Haul parked in their
driveway” because they may have to move to be re-elected.  Another change is in store for 2012, when Californians will
vote in open primaries. The top two vote-getters, regardless of
party affiliation, will then move on to the general election.  Fastest Growing  Ballot initiatives in 2008 and 2010 gave the redistricting
task to the commission, five Democrats, five Republicans and
four people not affiliated with either party. Boundaries can’t
be set based on where incumbents live or to benefit them.  The 10 fastest-growing counties in the state are at least
40 miles (63 kilometers) from the coast.  Among them are Placer, which includes the  Squaw Valley  ski
resort and extends to  Nevada  and increased 40.3 percent to
348,432; and Imperial, a farming center that borders Arizona and  Mexico  and rose 22.6 percent to 174,528.  The most rapid expansion was in Riverside County in  Southern California , which rose 41.7 percent to 2,189,641 in
2010, from 1,545,387 in 2000. Stretching from Orange County to
the Colorado River, it attracted people looking for low-cost
housing and work in construction, distribution and
manufacturing, said  John Husing , an economic forecaster in
Redlands, California.  He said about 42 percent of the 660,000 new California jobs
created between 2000 and 2007 were in what’s known as the Inland
Empire, which consists primarily of Riverside and San Bernardino
counties. “All the available dirt is inland,” Husing said.  Empire Power  Riverside County’s white population dropped to 39.7 percent
from 51 percent, the census numbers released yesterday show.  Republicans represented 41.9 percent of the county’s
857,000 registered voters in October 2010, down from 47 percent
in 2000, according to the California Secretary of State’s
 website . Registered Democrats held steady at 36 percent.  California’s fastest-growing big city, according to the
census, was Fontana in neighboring San Bernardino County; the
data show it rose 52.1 percent, to 196,069 in 2010 from 128,929
in 2000.  “The Inland Empire has been ignored by the state and
federal government,” said Fontana Mayor  Acquanetta Warren .
“They’re going to start viewing us more as a contender.”  Warren was on the cusp of a trend when she moved from South
Central Los Angeles to the former steel town after the 1992
riots. She’s an example of what a mixed political bag California
can be. A Democrat until she was 27, Warren, now 53, is a
Republican, and Fontana’s first black mayor.  Silicon Slowdown  While inland counties boomed, the census found slower
growth along the coast, and that could mean the consolidation of
congressional districts, the Rose Institute’s Johnson said.  In the 10-county  San Francisco  Bay area, the number of
residents grew 5.3 percent, going to 7,413,121 from 7,039,362.
In Silicon Valley, Santa Clara County, home to  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  and Facebook Inc., the population rose 5.9
percent to 1,781,642.    Nancy Pelosi  and Jackie Speier may have to run against
each other” in a Democratic primary, said  Jon Fleischman , a
Republican political consultant in Irvine. Pelosi, from San
Francisco, is the House minority leader, and Speier, whose
 district  is mostly in neighboring San Mateo County, sits on the
 Oversight and Government Reform Committee .  When the last electoral plan was drafted in 2001 by state
legislators, incumbents were favored, according to Garry South,
at the time an adviser to Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat.  The result looked like a jigsaw puzzle. Former Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  singled out the 23rd congressional
 district , a strip that runs for 200 miles along the coast and at
one juncture is less than a mile wide, calling it the “ribbon
of shame.” The 23rd’s representative, Democrat Lois Capps, is
“happy to run for whichever district she is presented with,”
according to her spokeswoman, Ashley Schapitl.  Southern California Republicans in gerrymandered districts
could face more competition in 2012, according to the  California
Target  Book’s Quinn. He cited as an example David Dreier, the
Republican chairman of the House Rules Committee, who represents
a territory that snakes for 83 miles around the San Gabriel
Mountains to include wealthy foothill communities and exclude
others down below.  “If these seats are fairly drawn, Dreier wouldn’t be in
Congress,” said South, the former Democratic adviser. Dreier’s
spokeswoman, Jo Maney, didn’t return phone calls and e-mails.  About 44 percent of California’s 17.2 million registered
voters are Democrats, and 31 percent are Republicans, according
to the Secretary of State’s  website .  Nearly two-thirds of likely Latino voters are registered as
Democrats, according to a September  report  from the nonpartisan
 Public Policy Institute of California  in San Francisco. Asians
are also more likely to register as Democrats than Republicans,
by 46 percent to 27 percent, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
