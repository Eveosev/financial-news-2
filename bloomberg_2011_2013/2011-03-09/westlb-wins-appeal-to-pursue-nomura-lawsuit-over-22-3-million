WestLB AG, the German lender bailed
out during the financial crisis, said a U.K. appeals court gave
it permission to challenge a ruling dismissing its lawsuit
against a  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  unit over $22.3 million in notes.  A lower-court judge, which ruled against WestLB in trial in
November, declined to grant it permission to appeal, instead
allowing the appeals court to decide. The appeals court granted
permission yesterday, WestLB said in a statement today.  “We look forward to the case receiving a vigorous
reappraisal in the Court of Appeal,” WestLB spokesman Richard
Bassett said in an e-mail. The bank feels “vindicated in
choosing to pursue this matter,” he said.  While Judge Nigel Teare ruled in November that Nomura
International “acted irrationally” in valuing securities in an
investment fund after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., he said WestLB failed to prove it lost money it wouldn’t
have otherwise. The dispute involves the 2003 purchase of $26
million in shares of Global Opportunities Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
