Saudi Arabian authorities released
25 Shiites arrested during protests in the Eastern Province
earlier this month, according an activist.  The detainees were released yesterday, Ibrahim Al-
Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society, based in
al-Khobar,  Saudi Arabia , said today in a phone interview.  Shiites in al-Qatif held a demonstration on March 3,
attended by about 100 people and heavily policed, to demand the
release of prisoners. Another rally of a similar size took place
in the eastern village of Awwamiya the same day, while on March
4, protesters in al-Hofuf demanded the release of Shiite cleric
Tawfiq al-Amir. Activists said he was freed two days later.  Activists have called for a nationwide “Day of Rage” on
March 11, and a Facebook Inc. page advocating the plan has more
than 30,000 followers. The kingdom’s Council of Senior Islamic
Scholars this week condemned protests as forbidden, and the
Interior Ministry warned that demonstrations, marches and sit-
ins are “strictly” prohibited.  To contact the reporter on this story:
