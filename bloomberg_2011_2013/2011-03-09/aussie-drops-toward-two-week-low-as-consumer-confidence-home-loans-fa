The Australian dollar fell to a
two-week low against the greenback after  China , the South
Pacific nation’s largest trading partner, reported a surprise
trade deficit in February.  The  New Zealand dollar  fell to a five-month low after the
nation’s Reserve Bank cut the official cash rate to 2.5 percent
and pledged to keep borrowing costs low. The Aussie declined
versus 14 of its 16 most-traded counterparts after employers
unexpectedly cut workers in February.  “Combined with the weak job number earlier today, the
China headline knocked the Aussie lower,” said  Minoru Shioiri ,
chief manager of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in
Tokyo. “The trade deficit from China was unexpected as it’s a
big exporter country and thus is negative for the currencies
tied to the growth.”    Australia ’s dollar depreciated as much as 1.2 percent to
99.92 U.S. cents, the lowest level since Feb. 23, before trading
at $1.0011 at 12:05 p.m. in  New York , compared with $1.0108
yesterday.  New Zealand ’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to 73.51 U.S.
cents, from 73.66 cents, after touching 73.23 cents, the lowest
level since Sept. 30.  China reported a $7.3 billion trade deficit last month, the
biggest in seven years, after the Lunar New Year holiday
disrupted exports, according to the customs bureau.  Today’s number compared with a $6.5 billion surplus in
January. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists was for a $4.9 billion surplus. Exports rose an
annual 2.4 percent, the slowest pace since November 2009, while
imports climbed 19.4 percent.  Australian Job Losses  Australian employment fell by 10,100 in February, the
statistics bureau said today in Sydney. Economists in a
Bloomberg News survey forecast an increase of 20,000. The
jobless rate was unchanged at 5 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar fell after the  Reserve Bank  cut its
target lending rate by a half-percentage point and pledged to
hold borrowing costs low until rebuilding from the Christchurch
earthquake revives the economy. The median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a drop of a
quarter-percentage point.  Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard said in a statement that
the reduction may “need to be removed once the rebuilding phase
materializes.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
