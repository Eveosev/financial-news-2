  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Europe ’s
second biggest airline, posted a profit in 2010 as a rebound in
demand for travel spurred sales.  Net income was 1.1 billion euros ($1.53 billion), compared
with a year-earlier loss of 34 million euros, Cologne, Germany-
based Lufthansa said today. Analysts had predicted earnings of
626.3 million euros, based on estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue jumped 22 percent to 27.3 billion euros and profit
was swollen by a 400 million-euro one-time tax effect. Lufthansa
said the figures were “gratifying” given the impact of December
snowfalls and that it would award investors a dividend of 60
cents a share after halting payments the previous year.  “The results are quite reassuring, especially if you look
at the one-off weather events that impacted the carrier in the
fourth-quarter,” said  Yan Derocles , an analyst at Oddo
Securities in Paris with an “add” recommendation on the stock.  Lufthansa rose 4.7 percent following publication of the
results and was trading up 3.3 percent at 15.10 euros as of 1:23
p.m. in  Frankfurt , paring the stock’s decline this year to 7.8
percent and valuing the business at 6.9 billion euros.  Capacity Boost  The German company will boost passenger capacity at the
main-brand airline by 11 percent this summer to tap surging
demand, Thierry Antinori, who heads the unit’s sales department,
said today at a press conference in Berlin, adding that he’s
“convinced” that the extra seats can be sold.  Lufthansa’s full-year operating profit rose almost seven-
fold to 876 million euros, it said today. The company indicated
in January that it had beaten a target of 800 million euros,
even after the snowfalls wiped 65 million euros from earnings.  Results this year will be crimped by fuel costs of 6.5
billion euros -- 500 million euros more than in 2010 -- Chief
Financial Officer Stephan Gemkow said in a January presentation,
even before recent price increases during the Libyan crisis.  Hedging will help save money with oil above $88 a barrel,
spokeswoman Stefanie Stotz said Feb. 22. Crude for April
delivery was priced at $104.21 in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange .  Lufthansa said today it will cut the number of first-class
seats on its aging Boeing Co. 747-400 widebody jets to eight
from 16, adding that the move is intended to give customers more
space, in line with its newer Airbus SAS A380 superjumbos.  The move will reduce first-class capacity by 20 percent,
hurting revenue, sales chief Antinori said. Lufthansa began its
first upgrade of the cabins in more than a decade last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
