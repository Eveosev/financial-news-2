Natural gas shipments scheduled for
delivery to U.S. households slipped for a second day on
forecasts of above-normal temperatures that may erode demand for
the heating fuel.  Scheduled deliveries to homes in the U.S. and  Canada  fell
7.1 percent to 31.9 million dekatherms (31.1 billion cubic
feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 10:08 a.m.
in  New York . That was the lowest level since Nov. 16.  Residences in a region including the Great Lakes and parts
of the mid-Atlantic were to receive 12.1 million dekatherms of
gas, down 5.6 percent from yesterday, Bloomberg data show. Gas
deliveries for home use in the region have declined 44 percent
from a month ago.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants were down 5.2
percent to 12 million dekatherms, the first decline in four
days.  The low temperature early today in Columbus, Ohio, was 39
degrees Fahrenheit (4 Celsius), 14 degrees above normal,
according to  Weather Underground  in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The low
tomorrow may be 40 degrees, 15 degrees above normal.  Wholesale gas delivered into Columbia Gas Transmission in
Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania,  West Virginia , Virginia and New
York rose 7.24 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $3.8917 per million
British thermal units yesterday on the Intercontinental
Exchange.  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
climbed 10.29 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $3.8324.  To contact the reporter on this story:
