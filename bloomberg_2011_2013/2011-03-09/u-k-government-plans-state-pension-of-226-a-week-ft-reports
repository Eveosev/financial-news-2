The U.K. government plans to
introduce a basic old-age pension of 140 pounds ($226) a week,
to simplify the pension system, the Financial Times reported.  Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith indicated in a speech
that heâ€™s close to agreement with the Treasury on new
arrangements for the next generation of pensioners, who face
smaller private pensions as final-salary plans are terminated,
the newspaper said.  The aim is a 140-pound state pension from about 2016,
compared with the 102.15 pounds for a single person that will be
paid from next month and the means-tested 137.35 pounds paid to
the poorest, the FT said.  Only the newly retired will receive 140 pounds, however;
existing pensioners will get less, to keep the cost down, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
