Oil volatility slipped after
supplies at the delivery point for the U.S. benchmark grade
increased.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 38 percent as of 2:00 p.m. in New York,
down from 41.7 percent yesterday.  Inventories in Cushing,  Oklahoma , where the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  contract is settled, climbed 1.69 million
barrels to 40.3 million last week, the highest level since the
Energy Department began gathering data at the hub.  Crude oil for April delivery slipped 64 cents to $104.38 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract is up

They dropped 7 cents to 10 cents a barrel. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
