  Ghana ’s currency, the cedi, was
unchanged against the  U.S. dollar  after the central bank had yet
to sell foreign exchange to local lenders in its weekly sale
that normally occurs on Wednesdays.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
traded at 1.5240 per dollar at 12:54 p.m., unchanged from
yesterday’s close, according to data from Stanbic Bank Ghana
Ltd., a unit of Johannesburg-based Standard Bank Group Ltd.   The central bank usually sells dollars by mid-week and
before 12:30 p.m., said Chris Nettey, a currency trader with
Stanbic, in a phone interview in Accra, Ghana’s capital city.
“It’s not likely they’re going to be on the market this week,”
he said.  Collins Antwi, assistant director of the Bank of Ghana’s
treasury department, declined to comment on whether the sale
would take place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
