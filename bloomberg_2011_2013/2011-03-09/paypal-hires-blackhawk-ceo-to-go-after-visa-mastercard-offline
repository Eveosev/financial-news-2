PayPal Inc., the online-payment
processor owned by  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , hired Blackhawk Network founder
Don Kingsborough to oversee its expansion into physical stores
as it steps up competition with  Visa Inc. (V)  and  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Kingsborough, who led Blackhawk’s efforts to bring prepaid
gift cards to  Safeway Inc. (SWY)  and other grocers, will be
responsible for PayPal’s push into retail stores in the second
half of the year, the  San Jose , California-based company said.  “We’re going with a whole new experience that is different
than the traditional card-like experience,” President Scott Thompson said in an interview. “That requires us to rebuild the
whole infrastructure around point-of-sale. Don, because he did
that at Blackhawk, is the type of person we need here.”  PayPal, which rose to prominence after being adopted as a
payment system for EBay’s Internet auctions, is used in about  70
percent  of the site’s transactions. In pursuing its next area of
growth, PayPal is eyeing consumers using mobile devices and the
physical storefronts where Visa and MasterCard dominate. The
company plans to introduce a redefined point-of-sale system --
the equipment next to cash registers where consumers swipe
credit cards -- with major retailers this year, Thompson said.  “The physical point-of-sale is the next showdown,” said
Tom Noyes, a banking consultant at Davidson, North Carolina-
based StarPoint LLP. “Visa and MasterCard are starting to see
PayPal as much more of a threat.”  PayPal’s Bench  Thompson, 53, a former Visa executive who joined PayPal in
2005, has replaced most of the senior  management team  over the
past two years. He’s brought in executives from Citigroup Inc.
and  American Express Co. (AXP)  to boost the company’s expertise in
security,  customer service  and compliance with banking
regulations.  The management bench will help PayPal navigate the broader
world of payments, where it expects its global market share to
rise to 23 percent in three years, from 18 percent today,
Thompson said.  “Everybody at the executive level today has done something
bigger in their career than what they’re doing at PayPal
today,” Thompson said. “That means they’re not connecting the
dots for the first time.”  Kingsborough, 64, who is vice president for retail and
prepaid products, will build on his experience designing and
running the Blackhawk prepaid card network, which is owned by
Safeway.  Blackhawk  sells gift cards from retailers such as
Starbucks Corp. and Nordstrom Inc. at kiosks in Safeway and
other grocers.  “Ten years ago that whole industry didn’t exist,”
Thompson said. “Don, working with the Safeway executives,
created that business from scratch. That’s exactly the mindset
you need.”  Plastic-Free World  PayPal is not the only company seeking to promote a
plastic-free world where shoppers swipe phones at cash registers
in sandwich shops, enter mobile-phone numbers on a keypad to
transfer money, and push funds to a service station from their
Internet-connected car while pumping gas.  Efforts by  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to embed chips based
on so-called near field communications technology into their
phones are aimed at locking PayPal out of the nascent mobile-
payments market.  At the same time, Visa, MasterCard and American Express are
duplicating PayPal’s efforts. The companies spent, collectively,
almost $3 billion last year to buy Internet-based payment
processors.  “There are huge opportunities now even in the cracks
between features that PayPal hasn’t implemented,” PayPal co-
founder Max Levchin, who’s now an executive at Google, said at a
technology event in January. “There’s opportunity by way of
PayPal not having enough time to develop everything.”  Open to Developers  PayPal is trying to fill in those cracks by enabling
software developers to build products on top of its service.
Developers generated $1 billion in payments for PayPal in the
first year it gave programmers access to its software code.
Still, the project has hit obstacles. Osama Bedier, the
executive leading it, joined Google’s payments team earlier this
year.  PayPal says going after payments in the physical world will
help it double revenue to as much as $7 billion by 2013. As
shopping habits blur between online, mobile and physical stores,
PayPal says its expertise handling consumers’ transaction data
across multiple platforms gives it an advantage.  “The top executives of Visa and MasterCard must lay awake
at night wondering how many years it’s going to be before these
folks are substantially impinging on their business,” said Bill Smead, who holds EBay shares as part of $175 million in assets
at Smead Capital Management Inc. in  Seattle .  To contact the reporter on this story:
