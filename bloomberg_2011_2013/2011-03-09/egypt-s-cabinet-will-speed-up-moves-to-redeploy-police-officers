  Egypt ’s Cabinet has decided to speed
up efforts to fully redeploy the country’s police as it calls
for a halt to protests.  The Cabinet is concerned about lack of security and
sectarian tensions in the country, said a statement distributed
today in Cairo. “The current practices threaten the ability of
the Egyptian economy to recover and the creation of jobs,” the
statement said.  Prime Minister Essam Sharaf, who was sworn in on March 7,
has said his government will focus on restoring security and
productivity. Reviving an economy hit by the demonstrations that
led to the ouster of former President  Hosni Mubarak  is one of
the main challenges facing Sharaf’s government.  The Cabinet also urged Egyptians to cooperate with police
and said policemen had the right to defend themselves if their
buildings came under attack, the statement said. Complaints
about police brutality have fueled the demonstrations that
toppled Mubarak. Police officers were hardly seen on the streets
after the early days of the uprising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
