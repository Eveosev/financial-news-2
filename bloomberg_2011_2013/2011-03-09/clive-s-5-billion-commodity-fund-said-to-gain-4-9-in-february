The $5 billion Clive Fund, managed
by Chris Levett, returned 4.9 percent last month, said two
people with direct knowledge of the matter.  The fund, which invests in commodities and energy, gained 5
percent in the first two months, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the information isn’t public.  Clive’s February performance compares with an average
increase of 1.2 percent across hedge funds, as measured by the
HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index of Chicago-based Hedge Fund
