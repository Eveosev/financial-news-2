  MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI)  posted
its biggest two-day rally since July 2009 after announcing a
restructuring that would include  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
increasing its stake in the money-transfer company.  Shares of Minneapolis-based MoneyGram advanced 20 cents, or
6.6 percent, to $3.25 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading and earlier climbed as much as 9.5 percent, on
top of yesterday’s 14 percent gain.  Goldman Sachs would receive $77.5 million in cash and
additional preferred shares that may be equal to a 30 percent
equity stake if converted to common stock, MoneyGram said
yesterday in a statement. Boston-based private-equity firm
Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and its co-investors would get $140.8
million in cash and own about 55 percent of the common shares.
The deal may close in mid-2011, MoneyGram said.  “This transaction is beneficial to current and future
shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer Pamela H. Patsley, 54,
said yesterday in a conference call with analysts. “It
increases the attractiveness of our common stock by removing the
uncertainty surrounding the current  capital structure .”  MoneyGram, the second-largest money-transfer firm after  Western Union Co. (WU) , sold preferred stock to THL and New York-
based Goldman Sachs in 2008 after reporting declines in
investments linked to the U.S. housing market.  To contact the reporter for this story:
