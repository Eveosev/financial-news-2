The federal court jury that will
consider criminal charges against Galleon Group LLC co-founder
Raj Rajaratnam may include a friend of  David Tepper , the founder
of Appaloosa Management LP.  Karen Suchoff, one of the people questioned in jury
selection in Rajaratnam’s insider-trading trial in  Manhattan 
yesterday, told U.S. District Judge  Richard Holwell  that she
knows a David Tepper who owns a hedge fund. The answer came in
response to Holwell asking jurors whether any family or close
friends work as bankers or brokers or for mutual funds or  hedge
funds .  Suchoff didn’t make it clear whether her friend is David A.
Tepper, who manages Appaloosa. Tepper didn’t return a voice-mail
message left at his office after regular business hours
yesterday.  “I just know that he owns a hedge fund,” Suchoff told
Holwell. “I don’t know really what the hedge fund is.”  Suchoff said that Tepper doesn’t discuss business with her
and that her friendship with him won’t affect her ability to
serve on Rajaratnam’s jury. Holwell asked Suchoff if she sees
Tepper regularly.  “Not regularly,” she said. “We spend a lot of holidays
together.”  Tepper hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing or of having
any connection to the Galleon case.  Holwell told lawyers in the case to be ready to give their
opening statements today after they finish selecting 12 jurors
and six alternates.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
