  Kenya ’s All-Share Index dropped to
the lowest since May 13, retreating 1.8 percent to 73.25 by the
3 p.m. close in Nairobi.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index retreated for
an 11th day, slipping 0.3 percent to 25,107.63 by 2:37 p.m. in
Lagos, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mauritius’s
SEMDEX Index fell for a seventh day, losing 0.3 percent to
2,005.62 by the 1:30 p.m. close in  Port Louis .  Namibia ’s
FTSE  Namibia Overall Index (FTN098)  snapped three days of decreases,

excluding  South Africa . Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Bamburi Cement Co. (BMBC KN), Lafarge SA’s Kenyan unit,
fell to a more than two-month low, declining 7 shillings, or 3.6
percent, to 188 shillings. Business Daily quoted National Social
Security Fund head Alex Kazongo as saying rising competition
will reduce the company’s growth prospects. Kenya’s state-run
pension company will sell its 14 percent stake in Bamburi, the
Nairobi-based newspaper cited Kazongo as saying.  “That is bad trading strategy by NSSF,” Eric Musau, an
analyst at Nairobi-based African Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd.,
said in a phone interview today. “They should not make the
announcement before they have a buyer because the price will
fall.”    Sasini Ltd. (STCL)  , a Kenyan tea and coffee grower,
slumped to the lowest level in almost a week, falling 5 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to 10 shillings. Much of Kenya, the world’s
biggest black-tea exporter, will probably receive below-normal
rainfall during the March-to-May long rainy season, crimping
agricultural production, the Kenya Meteorological Department
said yesterday.  “People are reacting to the meteorological department
report forecasting a reduction in the volume of rain,” Wycliffe
Masinde, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital
East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “We expect
reduced output especially in the first half.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
