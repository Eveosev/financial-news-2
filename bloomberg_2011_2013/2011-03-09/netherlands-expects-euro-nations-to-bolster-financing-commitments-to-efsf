Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  expects euro-region countries to make new financing
pledges to bolster the European Financial Stability Facility
while maintaining its AAA credit rating.  “The 440 billion euros ($612 billion) need to be available
to lend out,”  De Jager  told parliament in The Hague today. He
expects the so-called second-line guarantees to be about 75
percent of the commitments the Netherlands and other euro-area
countries provided to create the aid facility last year.  “That risk doesn’t relate to the country borrowing from
the emergency fund, but actually to all participants to ensure
the AAA status can be used,” De Jager said before a meeting of
European Union leaders in Brussels on March 11.  The need for a capital buffer to back up a AAA rating cuts
the EFSF’s lending capacity to about 250 billion euros from a
theoretical maximum of 440 billion euros. The other components
in the emergency aid program are 60 billion euros in a fund
managed by the European Commission and 250 billion euros from
the  International Monetary Fund .  The 750 billion euros pledged by the EU and the IMF to help
European countries with financing problems is “more than
sufficient,” De Jager said. Ireland applied for a bailout in
November to help fund itself and save its banks, becoming the
second euro member to seek a rescue after  Greece .  To contact the reporter on this story:
