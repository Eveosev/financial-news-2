  Eric Clapton  raised $2.2 million at
a Bonhams auction in New York yesterday, as buyers competed for
his guitars, amplifiers and other memorabilia.  The tally for the  sale , benefiting the U.K. musician’s
 Crossroads Center Antigua  for drug and alcohol rehabilitation,
was almost four times its presale total of $400,000 to $600,000.  One of the top bidders was Russian collector Vladimir Avetisyan. Sitting in the middle of a packed room, he bought lot
after lot, from a $1,098 Crossroads gift bag to the day’s
priciest item, a 1948 Gibson L-5P guitar that fetched $82,960.
Prices include the buyer’s premium.  “This is the main hobby of my life,” said Avetisyan, who
plays guitar and is a vocalist for a Moscow-based Clapton
tribute band called  D-Black , which has a website
claptomania.com. “I love blues.”  Clapton fans, dealers and collectors pushed the prices for
most pieces far above their estimates. Every one of the
auction’s 138 lots sold.  “It just shows you the strength of feeling that people
have for Eric Clapton,” said Carey Wallace of the U.K.-based
firm  Wallace & Hodgson , which organized the auction. “I am
blown away.”  A 2008  Martin  acoustic guitar on which Clapton played the
song “Motherless Child” sold for $70,760, way over its presale
estimate of $3,000 to $5,000.  A 1920s mandolin-banjo with a presale estimate of $300 to
$500 sold for $3,904. A gold sales award for the album “Me and
Mr. Johnson,” estimated at $600 to $900, fetched $39,040.  A pair of 1997 Fender Twin amplifiers, used by Clapton on
his Legends tour in  Europe  that year, fetched $42,700, compared
with the estimated $9,000 to $12,000.  Three Sales  The sale, featuring 75 guitars and 55 amplifiers from
Clapton’s collection, was the third in which he offered items
for charity. A 1999 Crossroads sale totaled $5.1 million and one
in 2004 took in $7.4 million. Both were at Christie’s
International and every lot sold, including a black Stratocaster
for $959,500.  The selection at Bonhams was much more affordable, Wallace
said.  Avetisyan paid $51,240 for a 2008 sky-blue Stratocaster
designed for Clapton by the Fender Custom Shop. The presale
range was $20,000 to $30,000. It was probably used in concert
appearances with Steve Winwood and  Jeff Beck .  He also got a stained hardwood Fortune amplifier made
around 1979, for $5,124, up from its $600 to $900 presale range.  “I can use these old amps,” he said. “It’s hard to find
a sound like this these days.”  Stephen Becker, who practices internal medicine in Queens,  New York , paid $24,400 for a 1982 custom-designed guitar by
Strings & Things that had been estimated at $3,000 to $5,000.  Lifetime Chance  “I am a big fan and I figured it’s a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,” said Becker, who threw his hands up in the air
after placing the winning bid and got applause from the
audience. “I’ve been playing guitar since I was 5.”  Not everyone was lucky to land a piece of Clapton. Warren
Rybak, 58, who first heard Clapton in the late 1960s, was outbid
on a 1979 Danny Ferrington guitar he coveted. It fetched
$42,700, about 100 times its presale range of $300 to $500 --and
above Rybak’s budget for the guitar.  “I was more in mid-teens,” said Rybak, who lives in  Upper
Saddle River ,  New Jersey . “No matter what you pay here, when
you walk out, the value will be higher.”  To contact the reporter of this story:
