  Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , a Kenyan tea and coffee
grower, slumped to the lowest level in almost a week on concern
that drought in the East African nation may affect profit.  The stock fell 90 cents, or 9 percent, to 9.15 shillings at
the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the weakest since March 4. Sasini
has dropped 30 percent this year, making it the fourth-worst
performer on Nairobi’s All Share index after AccessKenya Ltd.,
Sameer Africa Ltd. and Eveready East Africa Ltd.  Much of  Kenya , the world’s biggest black-tea exporter, will
probably receive below-normal rainfall during the March-to-May
long rainy season, crimping agricultural production, the  Kenya
Meteorological Department  said yesterday.  “People are reacting to the meteorological department
report forecasting a reduction in the volume of rain,” Wycliffe Masinde, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital
East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “We expect
reduced output especially in the first half”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
