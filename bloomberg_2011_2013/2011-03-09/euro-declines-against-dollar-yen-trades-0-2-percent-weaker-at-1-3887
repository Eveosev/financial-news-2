The euro rose against the dollar on
speculation that the  European Central Bank  will buy bonds of the
region’s most-indebted nations to arrest a rout after the yields
on Portuguese debt climbed to a record.  Europe’s common currency reversed an earlier decline
against the yen after a report showed German factory output
increased more than economists estimated in January. The ECB
checked prices of Greek and Irish securities earlier today,
according to two traders with the knowledge of activity. A
central bank spokesman declined to comment.  “The euro turned after there was talk, which we can’t
confirm, in the market that the ECB checked prices of some
peripheral bonds,” said  Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at
UBS AG in London. “The factory output is strong.”  The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3924 as of 7:34 a.m. in  New
York . It advanced 0.2 percent to 115.13 yen, while the Japanese
currency was little changed at 82.69 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
