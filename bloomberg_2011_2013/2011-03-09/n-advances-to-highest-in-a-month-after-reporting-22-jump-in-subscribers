  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ,  Africa ’s biggest
mobile-network operator, rose the most in almost eight months in
Johannesburg trading after forecasting growth in subscriber
numbers in 2011 and announcing a plan to raise the dividend.  MTN gained as much as 4.5 percent to 131.40 rand, the
biggest intraday jump since July 15, and was up 4.2 percent as
of 3:27 p.m. That pared the stock’s decline this year to 2.8
percent, valuing the Johannesburg-based company at 246 billion
rand ($35.8 billion).  The number of customers jumped 22 percent to 141.6 million
last year, and MTN aims to add another 16.9 million in 2011, the
company said today in its  annual report . The dividend payout
ratio will be 55 percent of earnings per share, excluding one-
time gains or costs, of 9.09 rand, it said. That compares with a
40 percent to 50 percent ratio the company outlined in August.  MTN will increase payments to shareholders in the absence
of takeover opportunities, though the company will “continue to
evaluate” acquisitions, Chief Executive Officer Phuthuma Nhleko
said in a presentation in Johannesburg today.  A payout ratio of about 55 percent is “competitive,”
Nhleko said. “We would not like a reversal” below that level,
though the payout isn’t “pegged” and may shift, depending on
capital expenditure and expansion needs.  Net income fell 2.4 percent last year to 14.3 billion rand
as the rand gained against other currencies and because of the
costs of a program to encourage black citizens to become
investors in the company, MTN said. Sales rose 2.4 percent to
114.7 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
