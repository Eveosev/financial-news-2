Raj Rajaratnam’s criminal trial for  insider trading  began with the prosecution saying the Galleon
Group LLC founder used an illegal network of secret sources to
earn millions of dollars in illicit profits, while his defense
claimed he made decisions based only on public information.  Rajaratnam is the central figure in the largest
investigation of hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The
Sri Lankan-born money manager is accused of making $45 million
from confidential information leaked by corporate insiders and
hedge-fund traders. Rajaratnam faces as long as 20 years in
prison if convicted of fraud.  “He exploited a corrupt network of people,” Assistant
U.S. Attorney Jonathan Streeter said yesterday of the 53-year-
old Rajaratnam. “Using this network, he bought business
information. Using this network, he had his employees go out and
bring information to him. This was all information that ordinary
people didn’t have.”  “Mr. Rajaratnam traded on such information again and again
and again,” Streeter said “He knew what he was doing was
illegal.”  Streeter told jurors that they’ll hear Rajaratnam
committing crimes in “real time” as they listen to government
wiretaps. Rajaratnam told his accomplices to “trade stocks in a
way that would hide” their insider trading and to “create a
paper trail” that would conceal the illegal tips, Streeter
said.  Though Rajaratnam “knew tomorrow’s business news today”
because he had inside information, Streeter said, he didn’t know
that “the FBI was listening in.”  Suspicion  In the closing days of the scheme, when Rajaratnam began to
suspect that he was under U.S. investigation, he told an
associate to use a pre-paid cell-phone so they could hide the
scheme, Streeter said.  “The sources of his secret information were as different
as his investments,” Streeter said. He got information from his
own employees, “a board member at a public company” and
outside consultants including Anil Kumar, a longtime friend who
had gone to work for McKinsey & Co., Streeter said.  “He had access at the highest levels of corporations,”
Streeter said of Kumar, who has pleaded guilty and is testifying
for prosecutors in exchange for leniency.  In return for tips, Rajaratnam made payoffs to a Swiss
account that Kumar had set up, and the funds in the Swiss
account were later sent back to Galleon and invested in an
account in the name of Kumar’s housekeeper, Streeter said.  Goldman Board  Streeter named  Rajat Gupta , a former managing partner at
McKinsey and a  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  board member, as one of
the people who leaked inside information to Rajaratnam. The two
men had “close” ties, Streeter said.  Gupta tipped Rajaratnam in 2008 about an investment in the
bank by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Streeter said.
Gupta hung up the phone after learning of the Berkshire
investment at 3:53 p.m. and called Rajaratnam two minutes later,
Streeter said.  Two minutes after that, Rajaratnam bought $43 million worth
of Goldman Sachs stock.  “This order was so big, even the biggest brokerages house
on  Wall Street  couldn’t fill it,” Streeter said.  The investment reaped a $1 million profit for Galleon,
Streeter said. “$1 million, two minutes,” he said.  Streeter detailed another tip by Gupta about Goldman Sachs
losses, which prompted Galleon to sell its shares and avoid
millions of dollars of losses. Jurors will hear a tape of
Rajaratnam telling a colleague, “I heard yesterday from
somebody that was on the board of Goldman Sachs that they were
going to lose $2 a share,” the prosecutor said.  Intel Tips  Streeter said that Rajiv Goel, a former managing director
in  Intel Corp. (INTC) ’s treasury group, tipped Rajaratnam about his
company’s earnings. Goel, who pleaded guilty on Feb. 8, 2010, to
conspiracy and  securities-fraud  charges, will testify for the
government at the trial.  “At Galleon, people did legitimate research, but they
cheated too and that cheating is called insider trading,”
Streeter said.  “The government has it wrong,” defense attorney  John Dowd , of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, said in his opening
statement. Prosecutors, who used wiretaps to build their case,
focused on “snippets” of conversations and “didn’t do their
homework,” he said.  Dowd told jurors that Rajaratnam’s firm “conducted the
best research” in the business, had the benefit of expert
analysis, and reached decisions “based only on public
information.”  Mosaic of Information  “He assembled a mosaic of information and did his own
calculations,” Dowd said after outlining for jurors how
Rajaratnam -- or “Raj, to his friends” -- launched Galleon
after emigrating to the U.S.  It’s “natural” for “people like Raj” to develop
information, Dowd said. “Talking to corporate executives is
what Raj did for a living,” Dowd said. “It’s what investors
hired him to do.”  Dowd said the stock trades at issue in the case are just a
“tiny percentage” of the billions of dollars of trades that
Galleon did each year. “The information Raj gathered was
available to anyone willing to work hard,” he said. Galleon
“hired professional research consultants,” and its traders
“questioned executives from companies themselves,” he said.  “They would analyze company’s published statements and
regulatory filings,” as part of “exhaustive research,” Dowd
said. “The evidence will show that Raj did not cheat.”  Listen for Context  A critical piece of the government’s evidence is secret
government wiretaps of Rajaratnam’s phone calls. Those taps will
show Rajaratnam talking about “his work, the buying and selling
of stocks,” Dowd said. He said prosecutors will rely on
“snippets” of these conversations to try to prove their case.  “Listen for the context of these conversations,” Dowd
told jurors.  Dowd assailed the government’s witnesses, saying they’re
lying to “save their own skins.”  Dowd used most of his opening to offer detailed
explanations for Rajaratnam’s stock trades. He said, for
instance, that Rajaratnam was “building a long position” in
one stock long before he allegedly got the illegal tip. News of
impending layoffs by  eBay Inc. (EBAY) , another stock in which
Rajaratnam is alleged to have traded illegally, had been public
before he received another alleged tip, Dowd said.  “The whole world knew Hilton” was for sale, Dowd said,
referring to Hilton Hotels Corp., another stock at issue in the
case.  Stocks at Issue  One by one, Dowd went through the many stocks at issue in
the case, including Marvell Technology Group, Intel Corp., ATI
Technologies Inc. and  Polycom Inc. (PLCM)  Reading from a script, he
explained Rajaratnam’s reason for trading in many of the stocks
in the case.  The lawyer assailed many of the prosecution’s witnesses.
Kumar, the former McKinsey partner, was caught defrauding his
partners and cheating on his taxes and is now testifying only to
save himself from prison, Dowd said.  Payments that Rajaratnam made to Kumar were for Kumar’s
legitimate research on the Indian and South Asian stock markets,
Dowd said. Kumar didn’t share those payments with his McKinsey
partners, Dowd said.  Hedge Fund Trader  Dowd took aim at hedge fund trader Danielle Chiesi, who was
captured on wiretaps leaking what prosecutors said was inside
information that she received from Hector Ruiz, then the
chairman of  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)   Chiesi was all “talk, gossip and exaggeration,” which she
used to “impress others and insinuate herself” into
transactions, Dowd said. She didn’t understand what company
executives were telling her and she never passed along inside
information, he said.  Rajaratnam had legitimate reasons to trade in Goldman Sachs
shares and wasn’t tipped by Gupta, Dowd said. On Sept. 23, a
Washington consulting firm that Galleon had hired told
Rajaratnam that the U.S. Troubled Assets Relief Program would be
enacted into law and result in a $10 billion payment to Goldman
Sachs, Dowd said.  That was the reason Rajaratnam bought shares, and not
because Gupta told him that Berkshire Hathaway was buying into
the firm, according to Dowd.  ICBC Investment  Weeks later, Rajaratnam decided to sell Galleon’s holdings
in Goldman Sachs after a public announcement that the bank would
have to lay off 4,000 employees and pay $800 million in
severance. Dowd said Rajaratnam learned from public sources that
Goldman Sachs was going to lose $1 billion from an investment in  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., known as ICBC, so he
had Galleon sell its Goldman Sachs shares, Dowd said. He said
Rajaratnam realized the loss might cost Goldman Sachs
stockholders $2 a share.  “That’s why he sold,” and not because of a Gupta tip, he
said.  Earlier, U.S. District Judge  Richard Holwell  completed the
selection of a panel of jurors who will sit in judgment for the
next two to three months. Rajaratnam faces five counts of
conspiracy to commit insider trading and nine counts of
securities fraud.  The 18 jurors chosen include teachers, retirees, municipal
workers, a Federal Reserve employee and an unemployed 35-year-
old whose band, he said, could really use a drummer.  Juror 1, 49, said he works as a station agent for the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority  and lives with his wife
and daughters.  Juror 2, 70, a retired bookkeeper with past criminal jury
experience, said she was briefly a volunteer with the Israeli
Defense Forces. She watches “Two and a Half Men.”  ‘True Blood’  Juror 3, a 27-year-old Bronx woman, told Holwell that she’s
an activities therapist for a private nursing home. She said she
enjoys family trips and watching the programs “True Blood” and
“Grey’s Anatomy.”  Juror 4, 49, a woman who lives in East Harlem, has worked
in food service for the city’s Board of Education for 31 years
and likes watching television, particularly soap operas, she
said. Her education is through the 11th grade, she said.  Juror 5, a 61-year-old nurse, lives in Westchester County
and has a son in the Navy, she said. The juror has three years
of college and doesn’t read newspapers. She said she babysits
her grandchildren in her spare time.  Oprah, Letterman  Juror 6, 52, who is also from Westchester County and works
for the New Jersey Board of Education, said she is a fan of  Oprah Winfrey .  Juror 7, 68, lives alone in  Manhattan , reads the  New York 
Daily News and watches “The Late Show” with  David Letterman  on
television, he told the judge. He said he works as a receiving
clerk and attended school to the eighth grade.  Juror 8, a 46-year-old woman from the Bronx, teaches blind
and visually impaired children, she said. She likes reality
television shows and loves baseball, she said.  Juror 9 is a 56-year-old graphic artist working for Apple
Inc. He moved to the Bronx after living about eight blocks from
the downtown Manhattan courthouse. His favorite television shows
include “Man v. Food” and sports programs on the ESPN network,
what he called “the basic guy stuff.”  Juror 10, 48, a man from the Riverdale section of the
Bronx, said he works for the New York City Administration for
Children’s Services.  Juror 11, 53, a lifelong resident of Westchester County,
said she has worked for  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  for 31
years. She watches “Oprah,” “Dateline” and “America’s Most
Wanted,” she told Holwell.  Five Newspapers  Juror 12, a 55-year-old Manhattan resident, works as a
customer service representative for the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority. He said he is active in his church and
is a bird watcher. He reads five newspapers, and has a
bachelor’s degree in business administration, he said.  The alternate jurors include a science teacher from the
Bronx, a New York City teacher who lives in Westchester County
and restores churches, a Parks Department foreman who lives in  Mount Vernon , a school aide from the Bronx, and an information
technology specialist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Alternate juror 6 told Holwell he is unemployed and lives
in Harlem with his girlfriend and two roommates. He has a
bachelor’s degree in English and has held temporary jobs at the
American Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. He said he enjoys reading
and video games and belongs to a band that’s looking for a
drummer.  College Misdemeanor  In college in the early 1990s, he was charged with a
misdemeanor for receiving stolen property and pleaded guilty, he
said.  “It was a street sign that was in my room and they threw
as much of the book as they could at me, but I got away from
it,” he told Holwell.  Witness testimony is likely to begin today. The trial may
last 2 1/2 months, Holwell said.  Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have announced charges
against more than three dozen traders, corporate insiders,
expert networking consultants and lawyers since Rajaratnam’s
arrest in October 2009. The investigation may last another two
years, prosecutors have said.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
