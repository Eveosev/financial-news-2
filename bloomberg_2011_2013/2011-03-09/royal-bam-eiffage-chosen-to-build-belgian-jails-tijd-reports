A group led by Royal BAM Groep NV of
the Netherlands and another by Franceâ€™s  Eiffage SA (FGR)  have been
chosen to build three prisons in  Belgium ,  De Tijd  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The BAM-led group is the preferred combination to design,
build, finance and maintain prisons in Dendermonde and Beveren,
Belgium, while the Eiffage group has been picked to build a
prison in Marche-en-Famenne, the newspaper said.  The construction cost per prison is about 60 million euros
($83 million), according to the newspaper. The Belgian
government will now negotiate with the two groups over
definitive terms, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
