Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped this month to terminals near  New Orleans  widened
relative to Chicago futures as U.S. farmers curbed sales
following a slump in prices.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in March
at  Gulf of Mexico  ports was 52 cents a bushel above May futures,
compared with 50 cents to 52 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis was 66 cents to 75
cents a bushel above May futures, compared with 66 cents to 70
cents, the USDA said.  “It was another quiet day of farmer selling” because much
of the remaining U.S. inventory was sold as prices rallied
during the past few months, said Brian Basting, a market analyst
for Advance Trading Inc. in Bloomington,  Illinois . “Exports for
corn are picking up a little.”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 4.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $7.01 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
capping the first four-day drop since Nov. 12. The most-active
contract reached a 31-month high on Feb. 22 of $7.4425.  Soybean futures for May delivery dropped 33 cents, or 2.4
percent, to close at $13.49, the biggest drop since Feb. 22. The
price touched a 30-month high of $14.5575 on Feb. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
