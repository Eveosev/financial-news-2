Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s largest
privately held company, submitted a bid for a stake in
Slovenia’s  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d. today, Finance
 reported , without saying where it got the information.  Mid Europa Partners Ltd., a London-based private equity
group, also made an offer for the Slovenian retail chain, the
Ljubljana-based newspaper said on its website. The Agrokor bid
may be as much as 230 euros ($320) a share, Finance said.    Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d. is selling a 23.3 percent stake
in Mercator to help cut debt and bids from interested parties
are due today, according to the company’s spokesman Jure Struc.  Agrokor, based in the Croatian capital Zagreb, declined to
