Prudential Plc Chief Executive
Officer  Tidjane Thiam  told Sky News in an interview that U.K.
taxation is “too high,” saying “lower taxation drives growth,
drives employment and leads to higher revenues for the
government.”  Thiam said the U.K. has a “number of strengths” including
its geographic location and labor market, and  London  is the
“right location” for the company. “But as these various
elements move,” Thiam said, “that conclusion may change.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
