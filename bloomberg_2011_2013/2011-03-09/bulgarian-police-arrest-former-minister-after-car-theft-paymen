Bulgarian police arrested ex-deputy
foreign minister Feim Chaushev after he arranged the return of a
stolen car to its Turkish owner against a 25,000-euro ($34,700)
payment, Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said.  The owner of an uninsured BMW sports-utility vehicle
contacted Chaushev after it was stolen from an hotel parking lot
in February and was told he needed to pay the money to recover
it, Tsvetanov told reporters in Sofia today. Chaushev was
arrested yesterday at 8 p.m. as he was meeting the person to
whom the money was paid, after the Turkish citizen contacted the
police, Tsvetanov said.  Chaushev served as deputy foreign minister between 2005 and
2008, when he resigned over conflict of interests.  The  European Union  has repeatedly criticized  Bulgaria  for
failing to convict corrupt senior government officials except
for minor cases involving mayors and police officers. Bulgaria
ranks as the most corrupt EU country after  Greece , according to
Berlin-based research organization  Transparency International .  To contact the reporter on this story:
