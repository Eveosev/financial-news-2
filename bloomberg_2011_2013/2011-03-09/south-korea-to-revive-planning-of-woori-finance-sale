  South Korea  will draft a plan to
privatize Woori Finance Holdings Co. “as early as possible,”
the Financial Services Commission said today in a report to the
National Assembly’s policy committee.  The regulator suspended a sale of the government’s 57
percent stake in Woori in December after a group dropped out of
the bidding.  The commission also said it’s continuing efforts to
privatize KDB Financial Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
