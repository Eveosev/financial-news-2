South  Korea ’s won led gains in Asian
currencies on speculation central banks will raise borrowing
costs to tame inflation, widening the region’s yield advantage
over developed economies.  The Bank of Thailand will boost its benchmark rate today
and the Bank of Korea will do the same tomorrow, according to
economists in separate Bloomberg surveys. The MSCI Asia-Pacific
Index of regional shares snapped a two-day drop as crude prices
fell for a second day, easing concern that rising energy costs
will slow the global economy and stoke inflation.  “The market is looking to see some more-active monetary
policy,” said Chris Gothard, the Hong Kong-based head of
foreign-exchange business for Brown Brothers Harriman. “As soon
as you see a little bit of easing in  oil prices , that should
help some of the emerging-market currencies.”  The won rose 0.3 percent to 1,114.75 per dollar as of 11:28
a.m. in Seoul and the  Philippine peso  advanced 0.2 percent to
43.385, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Taiwan
dollar  appreciated 0.3 percent to NT$29.344, according to Taipei
Forex Inc.  Benchmark interest rates of 6.75 percent in Indonesia and
6.50 percent in  India  compare with a maximum of 0.25 percent in
the U.S. and Japan.  The won climbed for a second day as overseas investors
turned net buyers of South Korean equities for the first time
this week. The Bank of Korea will raise its benchmark interest
rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 3 percent
at a policy meeting tomorrow, according to all 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Inflation in February breached the
central bank’s 4 percent target ceiling for a second month.  Fund Inflows  “The jury is still out on whether high inflation should
lead to a faster won appreciation,” said Andy Ji, a Singapore-
based currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia .
“But for now, it seems positive for the won as  Bank of Korea  is
expected to move on rates tomorrow.”  The Philippine peso snapped two days of losses on
speculation investors are buying emerging-market assets as the
global economic recovery strengthens.  “Inflows are going to  Asia  and we will see the peso
strengthening at a gradual rate,” said Rafael Algarra, a
treasurer at Security Bank Corp. in  Manila .  The baht rose for an eighth straight day as oil prices
dropped 0.5 percent to $104.46 a barrel. The Bank of Thailand
will lift the one-day bond repurchase rate by a quarter of a
percentage point to 2.50 percent today, according to 17 of 20
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Three predict no change. The
baht added 0.2 percent to 30.32 per dollar, the strongest level
since Jan. 13.  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit rose 0.1 percent to 3.0315,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Singapore dollar
dropped 0.1 percent to S$1.2684 and the Chinese yuan declined
0.04 percent to 6.5712.  Indonesia ’s rupiah was unchanged at
8,788.  To contact the reporter on this story:
