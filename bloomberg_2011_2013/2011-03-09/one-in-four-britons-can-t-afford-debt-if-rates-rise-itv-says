Almost one-in-four Britons say they
are concerned they won’t be able to afford their debt repayments
if the  Bank of England  increases its key interest rate,
according to a ComRes Ltd. survey carried out for ITV Plc.  About 23 percent of 2,024 respondents in the study said
they will not be able to afford mortgage or loan repayments by
the end of this year if  interest rates  rise, ITV said in an e-
mailed statement today. Bank of England policy makers will
announce their monthly policy decision tomorrow.  Thirty-three percent said a “significant rise” will put
them in “severe financial difficulty,” compared with 50
percent who disagreed, the U.K.’s biggest commercial broadcaster
said. About 48 percent said they will put off making “big
financial decisions” until later in the year, ITV said.  ComRes carried out the survey between March 4 and 6.  All 61 economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast that
the Bank of England will leave its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at a record low of 0.5 percent tomorrow. The decision
will be announced at noon.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Scott Hamilton  in  London  at
