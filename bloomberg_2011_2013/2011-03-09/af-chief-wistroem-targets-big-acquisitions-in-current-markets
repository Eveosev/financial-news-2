  AF AB (AFB) , a Swedish technology
consulting company, may make acquisitions in any of the 20
countries in which it is currently present as it seeks to double
annual sales to 1 billion euros ($1.39 billion) by 2015.  AF is working through its acquisition list, focusing mainly
on a “few, big” acquisitions, Chief Executive Officer Jonas Wistroem said yesterday in an interview in  Stockholm . A firm
with 500 employees would be a “rather big” purchase, he said.  The company announced five acquisitions last year,
including Prague-based Meacont, which focuses on the energy
sector. AF has a target to increase sales by an annual 15
percent on average until 2015 of which half is to come from
acquisitions. Last year, total sales decreased 7.4 percent to
4.33 billion kronor ($681 million). With many potential targets
now on the market, the company’s current cash and credit lines
would allow purchases worth a total of 1 billion kronor,
Wistroem said.  “Acquisition prices are pretty high right now,” Wistroem
said. “We are always discussing potential targets but most of
the time it doesn’t lead anywhere.”  The biggest growth opportunities will likely come within
infrastructure consultancy services in  Sweden  and the energy
area in Eastern Europe. This doesn’t rule out acquisitions in
other areas, Wistroem said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
