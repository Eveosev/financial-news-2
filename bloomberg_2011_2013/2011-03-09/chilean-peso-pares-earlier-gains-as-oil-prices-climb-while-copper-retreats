Chile’s peso fell the most in two
weeks as copper, the country’s biggest export, sank to the
lowest level this year and oil traded near two-year highs.  The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 477.83 per  U.S. dollar 
from 475.26 yesterday. The currency earlier strengthened as much
as 0.4 percent.  The peso is the only major Latin American currency to fall
in the past week as rising oil prices push up the cost of the
country’s biggest import. Copper, Chile’s main export, tumbled
as much as 3.6 percent to $4.183 a pound in New York today.  “It’s the lower copper oil ratio because of falling copper
prices,” said Katia Diaz, an analyst at 4Cast Inc. in New York.
“As long as this combination that’s detrimental to the Chilean
peso continues we expect it to remain above 470 pesos.”  Brent crude oil for April delivery climbed 2.2 percent as
of 12:30 p.m.  New York  time to $115.54 a barrel. West Texas
crude, the contract most followed in Chile, was little changed
at $105.05 a barrel. Ras Lanuf,  Libya ’s largest refinery, closed
as employees fled clashes between rebels and government forces
and oil tanks at the nearby Es Sider terminal were damaged by
bombings today, according to Al Jazeera television.  Chile’s central bank bought $50 million today at an average
of 476.68 pesos per U.S. dollar, according to a statement on its
website. The bank is buying $50 million a day as part of a $12
billion plan to weaken the peso.  Implied Inflation  One-year breakeven inflation gained 3 basis points to 4.63
percent, near two-year highs.  The median forecast of 43 traders in a Chilean central bank
survey published today was that prices will rise 4.48 percent in
the next 12 months. That’s the most since the bank began bi-
weekly surveys in December 2009 and the first time that
inflation forecasts have pushed through the central bank’s
target range of between 2 percent and 4 percent.  Traders in the survey forecast that the bank would raise
its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent on March
17, while a minority of the traders and investors surveyed said
the bank would raise as far as 4 percent.  Foreign investors increased their bets against the peso in
the forwards market to $1.9 billion on March 7, according to the
latest central bank data.    Chile ’s government today paid a 6.7 percent yield on 35.9
billion pesos ($75 million) of 10-year bonds, the central bank
said on its website. The bank manages government bond auctions.
At its last 10-year peso bond auction on Feb. 9, the government
paid 6.95 percent, the highest yield since September 2008.  The government paid 3.37 percent on 30-year inflation
bonds, 3.23 percent on 20-year inflation bonds and 2.94 percent
on 10-year inflation bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
