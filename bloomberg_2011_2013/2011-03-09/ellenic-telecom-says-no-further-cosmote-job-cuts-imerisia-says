  Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO)  said there will be no more job losses at its
Cosmote mobile-phone unit after the announcement last month that
120 employees will go,  Imerisia  reported, citing Michael Tsamaz,
the company’s chief executive officer.  While the cuts already announced are necessary to safeguard
the company’s competitiveness, speculation that more jobs will
be shed is unfounded, Tsamaz said in a letter to employees, the
newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
