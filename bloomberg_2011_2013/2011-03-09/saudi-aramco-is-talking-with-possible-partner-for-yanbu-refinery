  Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest
state-owned oil company, is in talks with a potential partner to
develop the planned 400,000 barrel-a-day Yanbu refinery on  Saudi
Arabia ’s Red Sea coast, a company official said.  “We’re talking to potential partners. Somebody has showed
interest and we’re talking,” Khalid Al-Buainain, Aramco’s
senior vice president for downstream, said at the CERA Week
conference in Houston yesterday. “The work is progressing.
We’re not delaying any activities from finishing the detail and
design and doing the site preparation.”  Aramco is boosting refining capacity to meet demand at home
and aims to integrate fuel processing with petrochemicals output
to boost exports. The company is building a joint venture
refinery at Jubail on the  Persian Gulf  and another fuel
processing plant at Jazan in the country’s southwest.  The Jubail venture with Total SA is set to be complete in
2013, with the Yanbu refinery following in 2014 and Jazan a year
later, Al-Buainain said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
