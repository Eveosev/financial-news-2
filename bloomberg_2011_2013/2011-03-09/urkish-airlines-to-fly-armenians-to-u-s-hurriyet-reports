  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, the carrier
known as Turkish Airlines, will open an office in  Armenia â€™s
capital Yerevan and fly Armenian passengers to and from the
U.S., Hurriyet said citing chairman Hamdi Topcu.  Turkish Airlines will charter planes between Yerevan and
Istanbul and then fly passengers to Los Angeles, where many
Armenians live, Topcu said, according to the Istanbul-based
newspaper.  The plan will adhere to Turkish government policy, which
prevents the state-run airline from opening direct flights to
Armenia. The two countries are in a diplomatic dispute over an
alleged genocide of Armenians in Turkey early last century.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
