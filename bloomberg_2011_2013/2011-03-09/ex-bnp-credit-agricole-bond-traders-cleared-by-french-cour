Three former bond traders at units
of  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  Groupe Credit Agricole  and a property
developer were cleared in a case involving what prosecutors said
was the sale of illiquid bonds at inflated prices.  The court in Paris dismissed charges including fraud, abuse
of trust and the receipt of stolen goods. Ariel Cheminaud,
Noureddine Benameur, Olivier Moulines and Elie Dahan were
cleared of all allegations.  The case was the result of an investigation that lasted
nearly 12 years and was criticized for not pursuing leads
outside  France . A lawyer for Benameur, who worked at Banque de
Financement et de Tresorie, now part of  Credit Agricole , said he
was pleased with the verdict.  “The prosecution was based on a bad definition of the
abuse of trust charge and so the court could not have ruled
otherwise,” said Guy Nicolas, Benameur’s lawyer. “Regardless,
my client denies having diverted any money, regardless of the
definition.”  Judge Agnes Quantin didn’t outline the reasoning for the
decision in the verdict today.  “I am very happy. This has been a frustrating process,”
said Dahan, the real estate developer, outside the court.  The other men didn’t immediately respond to requests to
comment on the verdict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
