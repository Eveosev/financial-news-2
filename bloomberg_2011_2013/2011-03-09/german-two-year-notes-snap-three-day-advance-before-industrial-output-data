German government notes snapped a
three-day gain before a report that is forecast to show
industrial production in  Europe â€™s biggest economy rose in
January, and as traders awaited a debt sale by Portugal.  The decline sent two-year yields up two basis points to
1.76 percent as of 7:30 a.m. in London. The 1.5 percent security
due March 2013 rose 0.03, or 30 euro cents per 1,000-euro
($1,390) face amount, to 99.490.  Industrial production in  Germany  grew 1.7 percent from the
previous month, after a decline of 1.5 percent in December,
according to the median estimate of 35 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Germany is scheduled to sell 2 billion euros of inflation-
linked bonds due April 2020. Portugal plans to auction as much
as 1 billion euros of 5.45 percent bonds due 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
