  Rod Blagojevich , the former  Illinois 
governor who faces 20 criminal counts arising from his 2009
indictment on corruption charges, asked a judge to dismiss his
retrial set for April and proceed to sentencing.  A Chicago jury in August convicted Blagojevich, 54, on a
single count of making a false statement to federal
investigators, deadlocking on the remaining charges in the case.  U.S. prosecutors last month told a federal judge they will
drop two racketeering charges and a wire-fraud charge against
Blagojevich as they are “effectively redundant” of those
remaining in the indictment.  “A second prosecution of this case is an irresponsible use
of taxpayer funds in light of the current economic crisis and
Blagojevich’s imminent sentencing on the conviction from the
first trial,” according to court papers filed today in federal
court in  Chicago .  The case is U.S. v. Blagojevich, 08-cr-00888, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
