  First Data  Corp., the credit-card
processor acquired by KKR & Co. in 2007 for $27.5 billion, said
it plans to seek to extend a portion of the loans used to
finance the buyout, according to a regulatory filing.  The company will host a call with lenders tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. in  New York , according to a person with knowledge of the
matter. Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. will arrange
the extension, said another person briefed on the matter. Both
people declined to be identified because the talks are private.  First Data said it is seeking to push out maturities on $3
billion of its existing term loan facilities to March 2018. The
loan is due September 2014, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Atlanta-based company also is looking to extend
the maturity of its revolving  credit line  to June 2015. The
$1.77 billion facility is due September 2013, the data show.  The extended loans will pay interest at 2.75 percentage
points to 3.75 percentage points more than the applicable
lending benchmark, the company said. Lenders will receive a fee
of 75 basis points on the undrawn portion of the extended
revolving credit line.  The extension is contingent on a note sale of at least $750
million, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
