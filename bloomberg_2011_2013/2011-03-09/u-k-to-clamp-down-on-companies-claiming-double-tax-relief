Treasury minister David Gauke said
the U.K. government will legislate to prevent companies
exploiting a loophole that allows them to claim tax breaks and
defraud authorities of “hundreds of millions of pounds.”  Some large businesses sell, lease back and reacquire the
same machinery or plant over weeks in order to claim tax relief
twice on a single item, Gauke said in a written statement to
Parliament today.  Declared spending in the scheme is in excess of 1 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion) and has taken place more than a dozen
times, he said.  “The legislation will simply put beyond any doubt that it
is not possible to claim relief for some expenditure twice,”
Gauke said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
