A U.K. appeals court ordered the
reduction of a $52.6 million award to Russian billionaire  Boris Berezovsky  in a case over a 2003 loan.  The Court of Appeal in  London  today ruled the amount owed
to Berezovsky was miscalculated by a trial judge. The parties
should either agree on a new figure or take the matter back to
court for review, the ruling said.  Berezovsky sued Ruslan Fomichev, his business partner
Vasily Peganov, and their trading company Anstead Holdings Inc.
over a $50 million loan made in 2003 by North Shore Inc., an
offshore entity set up by Berezovsky.  The dispute arose after nearly half of the money was frozen
by Swiss authorities as part of a probe into embezzlement claims
against Berezovsky related to the Russian carrier OAO Aeroflot,
according to court documents. Fomichev claimed the contract
could be avoided because Berezovsky failed to warn him that the
money could be frozen if it were deposited in  Switzerland .  In its judgment today, the court refused an attempt by
Fomichev and Peganov to have the case dismissed entirely,
leaving them with nothing to pay. Their lawyer Gerald Cooke said
in a telephone interview that they planned to appeal the ruling
to the  Supreme Court , the highest court in the U.K.  Jennifer Morgan, Berezovsky’s spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately respond to a message seeking comment.  The case is North Shore Ventures v Anstead Holdings and
others, U.K. Court of Appeal, Civil Division, case number
A3/2010/1673(A).  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Lumley  in London at
