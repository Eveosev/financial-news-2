  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s Ugandan unit said
it may block calls to the network operated by Libyan-owned
Uganda Telecom Ltd. over an unpaid bill.  MTN Uganda Ltd., the East African nation’s biggest phone
company, is owed 20 billion shillings ($8.39 million) by the
rival company, according to a company statement published in the
Kampala-based  New Vision  newspaper today. Calls between the two
networks will be severed on March 14 unless the debt, which
accumulated over a three-year period, is repaid, it said.  The continued interconnection with Uganda Telecom “is now a
business risk as the debt continues to grow unabated,” MTN
Uganda said.  Fatuma Nalubowa, a spokeswoman for Uganda Telecom, said the
company is dealing with the matter.  “It was a small disagreement but it will be sorted out,”
she said by phone today from Kampala.  The Libyan Arab Portfolio, or LAP Green Network, owns 51
percent interest of Uganda Telecom, while the remaining shares
are held by the Ugandan government.  MTN Group is  Africa ’s biggest mobile-phone operator. The
Ugandan unit says it accounts for about 50 percent of the
country’s more than 12 million phone subscribers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
