Four of  Canada â€™s six biggest banks
are opposed to the planned sale of  TMX Group Inc. (X)  to the  London
Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) , the Globe and Mail reported. The
lenders, including  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  and  Bank of Nova
Scotia (BNS) , plan to release a letter as early as this week outlining
their concerns, the paper said. The banks say the proposed
merger of  stock exchanges  means Canada would lose clout as a
financial center.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
