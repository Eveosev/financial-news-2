Global real estate investors shifted
their focus toward commercial property in  Germany  and away from
the U.K., where prices have risen the fastest, according to  CB
Richard Ellis Group Inc. (CBG)   About 32 percent of investors intend to buy in Germany this
year, up from 18 percent in 2010, according to a report released
today by the Los Angeles-based property adviser. CBRE announced
the results of its survey of 350 investors at a conference in
Cannes,  France .  “The U.K. led the European market recovery in both
transaction volumes and property values from the low point in
2009,” CBRE said in the report. “But the survey revealed that
investor attention is starting to turn elsewhere, possibly as a
result of the degree of capital value growth that has already
been realized in the U.K.’s prime markets.”  Investors planning to spend in the U.K. have fallen by
almost half, from about 31 percent in 2010. Retail property
surpassed office buildings as the most attractive property type,
with 43 percent of investors targeting it compared with 34
percent a year earlier. Well-located shopping malls in Germany
are offering yields close to the 2006 peak, CBRE said.
      Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) , the second-largest publicly traded
broker, said yesterday that it expects investment in commercial
real estate in  Europe  to rise by 30 percent this year from the
102 billion euros ($141.8 billion) spent in 2010.  A shortage of well-located commercial property will cause
rents to rise and encourage investors, Chicago-based JLL said in
a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
