  Mexico ’s peso rose to the strongest
level since 2008 after inflation slowed more than forecast,
cementing expectations the central bank can keep borrowing costs
low to stoke growth.  The peso gained 0.6 percent to 11.9291 per  U.S. dollar  at 5
p.m.  New York  time, from 12.0054 yesterday. The closing price
was the strongest since Oct. 6, 2008. The currency has advanced
3.5 percent against the dollar this year, the best performer
among the major Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The central bank already came out last week and said
inflation was controlled and within its targets,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Base Internacional Casa de Bolsa
in Monterrey. “Inflation has not been contaminated by all the
external shocks.”  Policy makers held the benchmark overnight lending rate at
a record low 4.5 percent for a 17th meeting on March 4. The
balance of risk for inflation has deteriorated, the bank said in
its statement last week. Consumer prices rose 3.57 percent in
February from a year earlier, below the median estimate of 3.6
percent in a Bloomberg survey, the central bank said today.  The bank will wait until the first quarter of next year to
raise rates, increasing the lending rate to 5 percent, according
to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Inflation will slow to within the central bank’s target range of
3 percent plus or minus 1 percent by the end of the year,
central bank Governor Agustin Carstens has said.  Inflation Forecast  The bank lowered its first-quarter inflation forecast to
between 3 percent and 4 percent on Feb. 9. The bank sees
inflation of 3 percent to 4 percent in the second quarter of
2011. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last
week that rising commodity prices will lead to a “temporary”
increase in inflation, and European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said inflation risks have moved to the
“upside.”  Oil has risen 54 percent since May, as the global economy
emerged from the worst recession since the 1930s. The commodity
has surged to as high as $106.95 per barrel as violence in  Libya 
threatened to curtail supplies and spread to other oil-producing
nations. Food costs rose to a record last month and may continue
to rise, the  United Nations  said March 3.    Oil Prices   “The peso might be finally beginning to react to higher
oil prices amid a strengthening U.S. economy,” wrote Francisco Diez, director of emerging-market trading at  RBC Capital Markets 
in New York, in a note to clients today. Crude oil is Mexico’s
second-largest export, and revenue from sales of oil fund about
a third of the government’s budget.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due 2024 fell 6
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.879 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.54 centavo to 117.73 centavos per peso.  Domestic sales of automobiles rose 13 percent to 66,990
last month from a year earlier, the nation’s Automobile Industry
Association said today. Automobiles and auto parts are the
nation’s largest export. Production rose to 193,527 units in
February, the association said.  Traders exercised $367 million in dollar options today, the
central bank said on its website. So far this month, $400
million in options have been triggered. The bank has been buying
as much as $600 million monthly since March 2010, as it seeks to
boost foreign reserves and curb the peso’s gain.  Foreign reserves rose to a record $122 billion in the week
ending March 4, the central bank said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
