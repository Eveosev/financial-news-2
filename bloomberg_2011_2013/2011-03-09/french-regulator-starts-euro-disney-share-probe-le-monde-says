The French stock market regulator
has started a probe into a 94 percent rise in  Euro Disney SCA (EDL) 
shares since Feb. 8, the Le Monde newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The volume of shares traded has reached more than 50 times
normal levels on some days during the period, according to the
daily newspaper. Euro Disney Chairman Philippe Gas told
shareholders March 4 that he saw no “real explanation,” for
the rise, Le Monde said.  A spokeswoman for the regulator wasn’t immediately
available to comment on the Le Monde report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
