The  Philadelphia Flyers  signed
former Brown University forward Harry Zolnierczyk, the reigning
Ivy League hockey Player of the Year.  Zolnierczyk, 23, agreed on an entry-level contract for the
2011-12 season, the Flyers said in an e-mailed news release
yesterday. He will join Philadelphia’s American Hockey League
affiliate, the Adirondack Phantoms, on an amateur tryout
agreement, the  Brown Daily Herald  reported on its website.  “It’s something you dream about your entire life, and now
that it’s finally come true, it’s almost surreal,” Zolnierczyk
was cited as saying by the newspaper.  Aaron Volpatti on Dec. 30 became the first ex-Brown player
other than a goalie to appear in a National Hockey League game
since Ryan Mulhern played in three games for the  Washington
Capitals  during the 1997-98 season. Volpatti has played in 15
NHL games for the  Vancouver Canucks .  Brown has had 28 players drafted by NHL teams, according to
the school’s website. Curt Bennett was among the most successful
in the NHL, playing from 1971 to 1980 for teams including the  New York Rangers , Atlanta Flames and St. Louis Blues.  Zolnierczyk had 33 points in his junior year and led the
Bears in scoring with 16 goals and 31 points in 2010-11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
