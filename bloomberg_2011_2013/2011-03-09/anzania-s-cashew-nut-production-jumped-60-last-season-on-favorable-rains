Cashew nut output in Tanzania,  Africa ’s third-largest producer, jumped 60 percent in the
marketing year that ended in February, spurred by rainfall,
the state-run  Cashew Nut Board of Tanzania  said.  The East African nation produced 120,000 metric tons of the
nuts, compared with 75,000 tons a year earlier, Director General
Beno Mhagama said in an e-mailed response to questions today.
Tanzania, which had been targeting production of 121,800 tons,
was helped by good weather and sufficient rain, he said  Tanzania is Africa’s  largest  cashew nut grower after
Nigeria and the  Ivory Coast , and the world’s eighth biggest
producer, according to the  United Nations ’  Food and Agricultural
Organization .  The East African nation earned 202.6 billion Tanzanian
shillings ($134 million) from sales of the nuts last season, up
from 90 billion shillings in 2009-2010, helped by higher prices,
the board said.  As many as 500,000 smaller-holder farmers grow cashew nuts
in Tanzania’s Mtwara, Lindi, Coast, Ruvuma and Tanga regions,
according to the board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
