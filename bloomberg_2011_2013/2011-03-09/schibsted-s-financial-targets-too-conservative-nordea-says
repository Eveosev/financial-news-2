  Schibsted ASA (SCH) ’s sales and growth
targets, set six months ago, are “too conservative,” Nordea
Markets wrote in a note after  Norway ’s biggest media company
said advertising was picking up.  “Schibsted was extremely confident” at a Stockholm
presentation for investors yesterday, Tore Oestby, an analyst at
Nordea, which hosted the event, said in an e-mailed note. “Its
financial targets seem too conservative and should have been
higher if they were set now.”  Schibsted Chief Financial Officer Trond Berger said
yesterday a “strong” development for online classifieds is
continuing this year, and advertising in printed newspapers has
“positive” momentum, according to Oestby’s note published today.
Schibsted, based in Oslo, said Sept. 22 that it expects a margin
for earnings before interest, tax and amortization of 10 percent
to 12 percent for the coming three to five years, and expects
growth in operating revenue of about 5 percent.  Nordea estimates revenue growth of 5.4 percent for 2011 and
an Ebita margin of 14 percent. The company will be debt free by
the end of 2012 or early 2013, “unless it increases dividends
significantly,” Oestby said. Schibsted’s net interest bearing
debt was 1.82 billion kroner ($326 million) last year.  “Schibsted has an excellent market position to benefit from
the cyclical uptick in demand and structural shift to online,”
Oslo-based Oestby said, recommending investors buy the shares.  Schibsted’s stock is unchanged this year, after jumping 32
percent last year and almost doubling in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
