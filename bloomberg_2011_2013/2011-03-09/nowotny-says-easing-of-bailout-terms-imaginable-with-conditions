European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said that he can imagine terms for
Ireland and  Greece  to be loosenend, should conditions be
fulfilled, according to an interview with Austrian state radio
ORF.  “One has to discuss this in the bigger picture,” Nowotny
told ORF. “That means, if you have the feeling that these
countries are really making an effort, that structural changes
are happening, that these problems won’t resurface again in two
years, then it can make sense to adjust individual screws.
Should this not be the case I don’t see any reason for
changes.”   Should the conditions be fulfilled it is worth considering
how to adjust to program to make it as “sure as possible that
it will be successful,” he told the radio station.    Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
