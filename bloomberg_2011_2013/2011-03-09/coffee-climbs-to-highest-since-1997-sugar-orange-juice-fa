Arabica coffee extended a rally to
the highest price since May 1997 on speculation that global
supplies won’t satisfy demand. Sugar and orange juice declined.  The  International Coffee Organization  said in a report
posted today on its website that a “precarious” balance
between supply and demand in the global market “continues to
favor firm prices.” Inventories held by exporting nations are
close to a 40-year low, the group said last month. Futures have
more than doubled in the past year as world crops declined.  “Everyone’s holding onto their arabica beans,” said Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity Trading Corp., a commodities
brokerage in Medford,  Oregon . “The market is tight until
picking starts in  Brazil ,” usually in May, he said.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery climbed 7.65 cents,
or 2.7 percent, to settle at $2.9485 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached $2.9665,
the highest for a most-active contract since May 1997.  Prices may extend gains through June on “production
downgrades, the decline in global stocks and supply tightness
that should keep markets fearful of any disruptions,”  Barclays
Capital  said in a report.  In the second half, prices may moderate with the market in
a surplus of 2.5 million bags, Barclays analyst Sudakshina Unnikrishnan said in the report. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132
pounds). Brazil is the world’s biggest producer.  In  London , robusta-coffee futures for May delivery rose
$95, or 3.9 percent, to $2,557 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery slid 0.28 cent, or 0.9
percent, to 30.42 cents a pound on ICE. The price has more than
doubled since June 1 and touched a 30-year high of 36.08 cents
last month.  In London, refined-sugar futures for May delivery dropped
$12, or 1.6 percent, to $751.10 a ton.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery dropped 2.85 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $1.7405 a pound in  New York , after touching
$1.7850 yesterday, the highest since Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
