One of  Ghana ’s two main teachers’
unions called a strike after wage payments were disrupted by the
introduction of a new pay structure, Joy FM said.  Members of the  National Association of Graduate Teachers ,
which represents teachers who hold a university degree, started
striking today, the Accra-based radio station said on its
 website , citing Angel Carbonu, vice president of the union.  Errors in payment of February salaries by the government
will be corrected by the end of this month, Betty Mould-Iddrisu,
Ghana’s education minister, told reporters on March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
