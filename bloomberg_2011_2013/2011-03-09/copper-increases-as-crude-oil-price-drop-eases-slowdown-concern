Copper advanced in London, reversing
an early decline, as  oil prices  dropped for a second day, easing
concern that high fuel costs may curb the global economic
recovery and reduce demand growth.  Copper for three-month delivery gained 0.7 percent to
$9,596.75 a metric ton at 6:02 p.m. in Singapore. New York-
traded crude fell as much as 0.8 percent today after American
Petroleum Institute data showed an inventory increase.  “Risk appetite improved on weaker oil and rallying
equities,”  Mark Pervan , Melbourne-based head of commodity
research at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., wrote
today in a daily report.  Copper decreased to the lowest level in almost two weeks
yesterday. Prices have fallen about 6 percent from a record
$10,190 reached Feb. 15 on speculation the oil price rally may
slow economic growth and as metal stockpiles expanded.  The Lisbon-based International Copper Study Group  projected 
a 2011 shortage of about 400,000 tons in October. Prices rallied
to a record on speculation of such a deficit. Stockpiles tracked
by exchanges in  London ,  New York  and Shanghai rose for a fifth
straight day yesterday to 660,826 tons, the highest level since
July, according to Bloomberg data.  “The supply-and-demand picture now looks weaker,”  David Thurtell , head of base metals research at Citigroup Inc. in
Singapore, said today by phone.  ‘Well Supplied’  Copper scrap and concentrate markets are “well supplied,”
Deutsche Bank AG’s head of commodities research  Michael Lewis 
wrote in an e-mailed report today. Metal stockpiles in so-called
bonded warehouses, which don’t publish data, are “high at
around 500,000 to 600,000 tons,” he said in the report.  “The window of opportunity for metals to perform is
quickly closing,” Lewis said. “This would generally be a
strong quarter for industrial metals from a seasonal perspective
and with global growth appearing strong and synchronous.”  On the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange, the May futures contract
closed up 0.8 percent at 71,600 yuan ($10,897) a ton. Futures
for May settlement added 0.2 percent to $4.346 a pound on Comex.  Aluminum in London increased 0.5 percent to $2,610 a ton,
zinc dropped 0.2 percent to $2,390 a ton, and lead was unchanged
at $2,590 a ton. Tin gained 0.3 percent to $30,675 a ton and
nickel added 0.9 percent to $27,075 a ton.  -- Editors: Ravil Shirodkar,  Matthew Oakley   To contact the reporter on this story:
