The  Reserve Bank  of  New Zealand  cut
the official cash rate to 2.50 percent from 3 percent, the first
reduction in almost two years, to bolster an economy teetering
near a recession after the deadliest earthquake in 80 years.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News were divided on the
outcome of central bank Governor Alan Bollard’s first policy
meeting since a Feb. 22 temblor killed more than 160 and leveled
parts of Christchurch, the nation’s second-biggest city. Four
expected a quarter percentage-point cut, six forecast
a half-point drop and five predicted no change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
