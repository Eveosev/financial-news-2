  CLP Holdings Ltd. (2) ,  Hong Kong â€™s
biggest power producer with assets across the Asia-Pacific
region, said the group reduced air pollution last year, with
sulfur dioxide output down 49 percent.  The power producer also met its target last year of cutting
carbon dioxide emissions by 800 grams for every kilowatt-hour of
electricity produced, the utility said in a statement handed out
