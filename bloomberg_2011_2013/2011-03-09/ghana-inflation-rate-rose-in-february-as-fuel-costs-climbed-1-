Ghana ’s inflation rate rose in
February for the second consecutive month as a 30 percent jump
in gasoline costs at the beginning of the year pushed up
transportation fees.  Inflation accelerated to 9.2 percent from 9.1 percent in
January,  Grace Bediako , head of the Ghana Statistical Service,
told reporters today in the capital, Accra. Prices rose 1.6
percent in the month, compared with 2.1 percent in January, she
said.  With February’s rate rise “less dramatic” than a month
earlier, “we expect a more limited impact on the monthly
increase in inflation over the coming months,”  Razia Khan ,
London-based head of Africa research at Standard Chartered Plc,
said in an e-mailed note today.  Bediako said food inflation slowed to 4.6 percent from 4.8
percent in January while non-food inflation acclerated to 12.1
percent from 11.8 percent a month earlier.  Pressure on inflation will weaken in March “as the effects
of the fuel-price increase begin to ease,” Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said by phone.  The inflation rate had fallen from a five-year high of 20.7
percent in June 2009, prompting the  Bank of Ghana  to lower its
key interest rate by 4.5 percentage points between November 2009
and July.  With the policy rate currently at 13.5 percent, an increase
may not be needed at the next central bank meeting in April,
Khan said. “A comfortable buffer remains in place for now,”
she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
