The Libyan Transitional National
Council’s calls for United Nations-backed air strikes against
regime bases have become muted because it’s a “sensitive”
issue, the Financial Times reported, citing council member Fathi
Baja.  “It’s a very sensitive question for Libyans,” Baja said,
according to the FT. “People in the council in general agree on
one thing - air strikes are more than welcome.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
