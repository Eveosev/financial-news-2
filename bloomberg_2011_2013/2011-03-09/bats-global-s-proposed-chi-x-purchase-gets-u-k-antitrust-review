Bats Global Markets ’ proposed
acquisition of Chi-X  Europe  Ltd., Europe’s largest alternative
trading system, is being examined by Britain’s competition
regulator.  The  Office of Fair Trading  will determine if the potential
deal would create a “relevant merger situation” and, if it
would, whether it will substantially lessen competition, the
watchdog said today a statement.  “We were expecting it and it’s standard procedure,” Kelly Bailey, a London-based spokeswoman for Bats Europe said of the
review today.  Bats, the fourth-largest operator of U.S. equity markets
and Europe’s second-biggest alternative trading platform, didn’t
disclose financial terms when the purchase was revealed last
month. Kansas City, Missouri-based Bats is paying $300 million
plus $65 million in potential future payouts if profit beats
targets, according to two people familiar with the matter, who
declined to be identified because the terms aren’t public.  The deal was announced as competition spurs exchange
operators to expand globally. Frankfurt-based  Deutsche Boerse
AG (DB1) ’s agreed to buy New York-based  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  for $9.53
billion, creating the world’s largest exchange operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
