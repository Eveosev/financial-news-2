The dollar rose against all its
major counterparts on prospects jobs data will signal a
continued recovery in the world’s largest economy amid signs
growth in  Asia  is slowing.  The euro fell to the lowest in one week against the
greenback after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Spain ahead
of a European Union leaders meeting tomorrow on measures to 
address the region’s debt crisis.  Australia ’s dollar dropped 
by the most in two weeks as employers unexpectedly reduced jobs 
and  China  reported a trade deficit.  “The weakness in the  U.S. dollar  will reverse very quickly
as the market focuses on more economic growth,” said Kurt Magnus, executive director of currency sales at Nomura Holdings
Inc. in Sydney. “The dollar will rise much higher.”  The dollar rose to $1.3823 per euro at 7:18 a.m. in  London 
from $1.3909 yesterday, after earlier touching $1.3805, the
strongest since March 2. It strengthened to 82.91 yen from 82.74
yen. The euro fell to 114.60 yen from 115.08 yen. The dollar may
climb to 84 yen and to $1.3530 per euro this month, Magnus said.  The number of Americans continuing to collect jobless
benefits decreased to 3.750 million, the least since October
2008, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists ahead
of the data’s release today. Initial jobless claims likely rose
by 8,000 to 376,000 last week.  EU Debt Crisis  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major trading partners, rose to 77.084 today,
compared with the four-month low of 76.124 on March 7.  The euro extended losses after  Spain ’s rating was
downgraded to Aa2 by Moody’s. The outlook is negative. EU
leaders meet tomorrow to discuss tackling a crisis that caused
Greece and Ireland to request financial aid to service their
debts.  “Markets will remain nervous ahead of the European finance
ministers meeting,” said David Forrester, a currency economist
at  Barclays Capital  in Singapore. “Investors are a little
worried that they’re going to underwhelm the market, so that
will pressure euro lower and help the U.S. dollar.”  Australia’s dollar weakened after the statistics bureau
said employment fell by 10,100 in February from the previous
month. That compares with the median forecast for a 20,000
increase in a Bloomberg survey.  China Trade Deficit  Chinese exports rose an annual 2.4 percent, the slowest
pace since November 2009, and imports climbed 19.4 percent,
according to data on the country’s customs bureau website today.
It had a $7.3 billion trade deficit, the biggest in seven years.
China is Australia’s largest trading partner.  “Combined with the weak job number earlier today, the
China headline knocked the Aussie lower,” said  Minoru Shioiri ,
chief manager of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in
Tokyo. “The trade deficit from China was unexpected as it’s a
big exporter country and thus is negative for the currencies
tied to the growth.”  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will increase interest rates
by 27 basis points during the next 12 months, down from 29 basis
points yesterday, according to a Credit Suisse AG index based on
overnight swaps.  The  New Zealand dollar  was close to the weakest level in
five months after the nation’s central bank cut the benchmark
interest rate to match a record low to help the economy recover
from the deadliest earthquake in 80 years.  Australia’s currency sank to $1.0037 from $1.0108 in  New
York , after earlier falling to $1.0022, the weakest since Feb.
24. New Zealand’s dollar was at 73.52 U.S. cents from 73.66
yesterday, when it touched 73.36 cents, the lowest since Oct. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
