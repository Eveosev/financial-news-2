  Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM)  climbed
the most in more than two months in Mumbai trading after CNBC-
TV18 reported that  American Tower Corp. (AMT)  is one among four
bidders vying for the mobile-phone company’s tower assets.  Reliance rose 9.6 percent to 99.35 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The stock rose the most since Dec. 24.  The Mumbai-based mobile-phone operator has been trying to
sell its tower unit, Reliance Infratel Ltd., since June. India’s
second-largest wireless carrier by subscribers had at the time
said it was in “advanced talks” to sell about 50,000 telephone
towers. A deal it announced with GTL Infrastructure Ltd.
collapsed in August with neither side extending the deadline.  Gaurav Wahi, a spokesman at Reliance, couldn’t comment
immediately.  American Tower’s Indian subsidiary agreed in February 2010
to acquire the Essar Group’s tower unit for about $430 million.  Separately, Reliance said today that it signed the final
documentation with  China Development Bank  for a 60 billion rupee
($1.3 billion) loan facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
