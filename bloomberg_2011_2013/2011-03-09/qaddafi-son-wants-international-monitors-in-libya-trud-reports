Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s son
Saif al-Islam Qaddafi urged the West to send monitors to the
North African country as clashes between rebels and Qaddafi’s
army worsen,  Trud  reported.  “I call on the entire world to send a mission of monitors
to Libya in order to assess the facts,” the Bulgarian newspaper
cited Saif Qaddafi as saying in an interview. “I appeal to
Bulgaria to send such a mission as well.”  He dismissed the insurgents as a “bunch of nobodies who
represent no one but themselves,” adding “we’ll overcome the
terrorists,” Trud reported.  Daily attacks on rebels and civilians by Libyan warplanes
prompted discussions among the U.S., European nations and Arab
countries over a possible United Nations resolution authorizing
a no-fly zone. President  Barack Obama  and U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron , in a telephone call yesterday, discussed
international actions to stop the attacks, the White House said
in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
