VAT  Khartsyzsky Trubny Zavod (HRTR) , a
Ukrainian pipemaker owned by billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, said it
repaid a $39.5 million loan to VTB Bank’s Ukrainian unit ahead
of schedule.  The unit of Akhmetov’s Metinvest Holding LLC, Ukraine’s
largest steelmaker, received the loan in June 2010 to “meet
needs of working capital”, according to a  statement  today on
Metinvest’s website. The Khartsyzsk, Ukraine-based plant was due
to repay by May 31, 2013, Metinvest said.  Metinvest obtained a $175 million loan from Russian OAO
Sberbank to finance capital investments, the company said in a
separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
