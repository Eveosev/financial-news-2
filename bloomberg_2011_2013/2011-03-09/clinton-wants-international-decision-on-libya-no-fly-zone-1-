U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said she wants the “international community” to
support a no-fly zone before it’s imposed on  Libya  and that a
decision should be taken by the United Nations and not the U.S.  “The people of Libya have to be supported,” Clinton said.
“We would like to see this resolved peacefully” and for
Libya’s leader  Muammar Qaddafi  to leave, Clinton said, “but if
that’s not possible we’re going to work with the international
community,” Clinton told Sky News in an interview today.  “Yesterday, the Gulf countries said that they would
support a no-fly zone. The Arab League said they would not
object to a no-fly zone,” Clinton said. Asked if the U.S.
supported it, she said, “Well, we want to see the international
community support it.”  “We think it’s important that the  United Nations  make this
decision, not the United States. And so far, the United Nations
has not done that,” she said, according to a transcript of the
interview released by the State Department.  State Department spokesman  Philip J. Crowley  said after the
interview that Clinton was not arguing in favor of a no-fly zone
at this point. The U.S. is trying to determine with its partners
on the best approach for Libya and will want international
support before taking action, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
