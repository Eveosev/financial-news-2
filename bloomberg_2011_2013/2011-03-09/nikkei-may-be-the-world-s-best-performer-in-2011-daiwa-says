Kazuhiro Miyake, chief strategist at
Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. in Tokyo, comments on the
outlook for the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average. The Nikkei rose 0.6
percent to close at 10,589.50 today in Tokyo.  “Investors are rediscovering Japan. Even with the yen
appreciating very sharply, you’re seeing earnings increase by a
large margin. If the  U.S. economy  improves enough to allow for
the end of quantitative easing and you have the dollar
strengthening against the yen, there’s a good chance that
earnings will improve even further.  “There’s a real chance that Japanese stocks will be the
world’s best performer.  “If the yen weakens against the dollar you could see the
Nikkei reach the 13,000 level in December.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
