ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp., the  Philippines ’ largest broadcaster, exceeded its 3 billion pesos
($69 million) profit target last year.  “Our target for 2011 is to match 2010,” Chief Financial
Officer Rolando Valdueza told reporters in Manila today. Net
income in 2009 was 1.7 billion pesos.  First-quarter revenue may drop from a year earlier in the
absence of political advertisements which boosted earnings in
early 2010, Lopez said. “We expect our other businesses to
achieve growth for this year,” said Valdueza. “Overall, we see
some growth.”  ABS-CBN shares fell 2.8 percent to 43.50 pesos at the noon
close in Manila, declining the most since March 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
