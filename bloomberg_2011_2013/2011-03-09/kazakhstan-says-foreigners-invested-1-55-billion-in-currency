  Kazakhstan , the biggest energy
producer in central  Asia , said $1.55 billion was invested in the
country’s currency, the tenge, from abroad since the beginning
of this year amid expectations that it will gain.  The central bank bought $5.5 billion from the beginning of
the year, Kazakhstan’s central bank Chairman Grigori Marchenko
told reporters in Almaty today. “If the share of foreign
investments in tenge will be bigger than from domestic sources,
we may apply restrictive measures like tax or other,” he said.  The central bank said March 1 a return to a “managed”
free float by abolishing the tenge’s trading corridor will allow
the currency to appreciate until it reaches a “comfort level”
for the economy. The factors “conducive to a strengthening” of
the tenge, including higher prices for oil, metals and grain,
will continue to gain momentum, the central bank said.  The regulator on Feb. 28 abolished the corridor it had used
to manage the tenge  exchange rate  by buying and selling foreign
currency in the past two years. The central bank devalued the
tenge by more than 20 percent in February 2009 amid the global
credit crisis.  Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
