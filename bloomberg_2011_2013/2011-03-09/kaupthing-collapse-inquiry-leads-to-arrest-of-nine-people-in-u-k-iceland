The U.K.  Serious Fraud Office  and
police in Britain and Iceland arrested nine men after searching
homes and businesses in London and Reykjavik during a probe of
the collapse of Iceland’s Kaupthing Bank hf.  Seven men, aged 42 to 54, were arrested in London after two
businesses and eight residences were searched, while two men,
aged 42 and 43, were arrested in Reykjavik in a coordinated
operation, the SFO said today in a statement. The Financial Times
reported that two of the men arrested were U.K. entrepreneurs
Vincent and Robert Tchenguiz.  U.K. prosecutors in December 2009 opened an investigation
into the possibility fraud occurred at Kaupthing prior to the
Icelandic lender’s October 2008 collapse. Kaupthing was the last
of Iceland’s three biggest banks to collapse that year.  The agency, at the time, said it was especially interested
in the bank’s efforts to attract U.K. investors to a high-yield
deposit account called Kaupthing Edge. More than 30,000 people
and companies in the U.K. invested in Kaupthing Edge, the SFO
said. Iceland took control of Kaupthing after the bank couldn’t
get enough short-term funding.  A call to the office of the Tchenguiz's R20 Ltd. wasn’t
answered and an e-mail didn’t receive an immediate response.  To contact the reporter on this story:
