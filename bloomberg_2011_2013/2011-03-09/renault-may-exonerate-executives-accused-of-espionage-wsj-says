  Renault SA (RNO)  is preparing to exonerate
the three executives accused of corporate espionage after an
investigation into the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing unidentified people familiar with the situation.  The company’s board may seek the resignation of Chief
Operating Officer Patrick Pelata in response to the probe, the
newspaper said.  Jean Reinhart, a lawyer for Renault, said the company won’t
take any actions until hearing from Paris prosecutors, who are
conducting an investigation, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
