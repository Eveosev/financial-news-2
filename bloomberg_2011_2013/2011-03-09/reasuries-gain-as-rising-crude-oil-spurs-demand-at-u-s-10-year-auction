Treasuries advanced as concern
rising fuel costs caused by  Libya ’s uprising will slow economic
expansion bolstered demand at the government’s $21 billion sale
of 10-year notes to the highest since April.  Benchmark 10-year yields dropped the most in more than two
weeks as crude oil traded near the highest level in more than
two years and stocks fell. The  Federal Reserve  bought $6.7
billion of Treasuries due from April 2015 to May 2016 to keep
borrowing costs low.  “The price action speaks for itself,” said Gary Pollack,
who oversees $12 billion as head of fixed-income trading at
Deutsche Bank AG’s private wealth management unit in New York.
“The main factor that’s been influencing the Treasury market
these last couple of weeks is higher  oil prices  and the possible
negative impact on economic growth.”  The yield on the 10-year note dropped eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.47 percent at 5:23 p.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 3.625
percent security due in February 2021 climbed 22/32, or $6.88
per $1,000 face amount, to 101 9/32.  The 10-year note yield earlier decreased 10 basis points,
the most since Feb. 22. It slid almost five basis points in the
hour before the auction results were announced at 1 p.m.  The securities in today’s offering produced a yield of
3.499 percent, compared with the average forecast of 3.535
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 8 of the 20 primary
dealers that trade directly with the Fed.  Auction Demand  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.32, the
highest since the April 7 offering.  “The market was surprised by the strength of the auction,
and we may see some follow-through if we stay at these yield
levels,” said Christian Cooper, head of U.S. dollar derivatives
trading in  New York  at Jefferies Group Inc., which as a primary
dealer is obligated to participate in U.S. debt auctions.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 53 percent of the notes, compared with
an average of 49.2 percent for the past 10 sales and a record
high 71.3 percent at the Feb. 9 auction  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 6.5 percent of
the notes, compared with the 10-auction average of 10.6 percent.  Demand rose at yesterday’s $32 billion three-year note
auction, with investors submitting bids for 3.22 times the
amount of debt on offer, the most since November. The government
plans to sell $13 billion of 30-year securities tomorrow for a
total of $66 billion in notes and bonds this week.  U.S. Note Losses  U.S. 10-year notes have lost 1.3 percent this year,
compared with a 0.6 percent drop for the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.    Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., eliminated government-related
debt from his flagship $237 billion Total Return Fund.  The portfolio last held zero government-related debt in
January 2009. Gross had cut the holdings to 12 percent of assets
in January, the  Newport Beach , California-based company’s
 website  said. The fund’s net cash-and-equivalent position surged
to 23 percent, the highest since May 2008, from 5 percent.  Yields on Treasuries may be too low to sustain demand for  U.S. government debt  as the Fed approaches the end of its second
round of quantitative easing, Gross wrote in a monthly
investment outlook posted on Pimco’s website on March 2. Gross
mentioned that Pimco may be a buyer of Treasuries if yields rise
to attractive levels.  Gross on Yields  Treasury yields are about 150 basis points too low when
viewed in a historical context and compared with expected
nominal gross domestic product growth of 5 percent, Gross wrote
in the commentary. The Fed is scheduled to complete purchases of
$600 billion of Treasuries in June.    Government bonds  rose earlier as oil advanced Libya’s  Muammar Qaddafi  stepped up attacks on insurgents. Oil fell later
today as supplies surged at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark grade.  Crude oil for April delivery dropped 1 percent to $103.97 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after touching
$106.95 on March 7, the highest intraday price since Sept. 26,
2008. Futures are up 28 percent from a year ago.  U.S. stocks swung between gains and losses as violence in
Libya tempered optimism that the biggest equity rally since 1955
will be extended into a third year. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index dropped almost 0.1 percent.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations for
consumer prices over the life of the debt, increased to 2.57
percentage points yesterday, the widest in 32 months. The spread
slipped to 2.52 today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
