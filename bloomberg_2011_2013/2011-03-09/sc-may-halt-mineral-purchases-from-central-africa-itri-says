Malaysia Smelting Corp., the world’s
third-biggest tin producer, may halt mineral purchases from
Central Africa because it can’t ensure the trade doesn’t support
armed groups in the region, a tin-industry group said.  New electronics-industry auditing rules resulting from a
U.S. law to curb the purchase of so-called conflict minerals
come into effect on April 1, too soon for tin traders to comply,
St. Alban’s, U.K.-based ITRI Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement
today.  MSC buys 15 to 20 percent of its tin ore from Central
Africa, and “it will no longer be possible to both continue with
those purchases and satisfy the requirements” of the new
auditing rules, ITRI said. Chua Cheong Yong, an MSC spokesman,
didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone or respond to an e-mail
requesting comment sent outside normal business hours.  MSC has been working with ITRI to develop mineral-tracing
and tagging programs in eastern  Democratic Republic of Congo ,  Rwanda ,  Uganda  and Burundi, ITRI said. The programs have been
delayed by a mineral-trading ban in place in eastern Congo since
Sept. 9. The moratorium, ordered by Congolese President Joseph Kabila to root out “mafia groups” that control the mineral
trade, will be lifted tomorrow.  “Without the support of MSC, it is unlikely that ITRI would
continue any project activity in the region,” ITRI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
