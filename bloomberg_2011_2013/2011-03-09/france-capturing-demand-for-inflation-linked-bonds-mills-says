  France  is seeking to capture rising
investor demand for longer-dated government debt and inflation-
linked securities, according to the nation’s debt chief.  “We’ve increased that proportion significantly” of bonds
maturing in 15 years or more, Philippe Mills, chief executive
officer of Agence France Tresor, said in an interview in  London 
today. The agency may increase the proportion of index-linked
bonds it sells to as much as 12 percent, compared with a target
for 10 percent, because it is “demand driven,” he said.  France is drawing an increasingly diversified set of
investors to debt sales, with central banks buying 5 percent of
its sale of 15-year inflation bonds this year, Mills said. That
was a “novelty,” he said.  France may sell securities in a foreign currency, and
“it’s not only a choice between euro and  U.S. dollar ,” Mills
said. He would need to see a reduced financing cost and an
increase in the investor base through the sale, he said. It may
be preferable to do any such sale in a “more quiet context”
for the euro, Mills said.  Bonds sold by the European Union’s financial rescue fund
aren’t likely to curb demand for French debt because they are
competing for different categories of investors, Mills said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
