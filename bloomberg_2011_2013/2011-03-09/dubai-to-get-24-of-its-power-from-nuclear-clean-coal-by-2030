Dubai plans to get almost a quarter
of its power from nuclear and clean coal by 2030, the head of
Dubai Electricity and Water Authority said.  “By 2030, 12 percent of our power will come from nuclear,
either through importing from our neighbors or by building our
own plant, and another 12 percent from clean coal,” Saeed Mohammad Al-Tayer said today in Dubai. A further 5 percent will
come from renewable energy, he said.  Dubai aims to build at least 2,000 megawatts of reactors by
2030, al-Tayer said. Dubai Electricity, the state-owned utility,
will have 9,800 megawatts of capacity by next year, he said.  The Dubai government said in June it aimed to diversify
power-generation sources and improve efficiency to ensure an
adequate  energy supply  through 2030. Dubai, the second-biggest
of the seven sheikhdoms in the  United Arab Emirates , produces
less than 4 percent of the nation’s oil. The emirate is seeking
to guarantee power supply and cut emissions contributing to
global warming.  The U.A.E. holds about 7 percent of the world’s crude
reserves, with most of the country’s deposits of oil and natural
gas located in  Abu Dhabi , the largest emirate.    Persian Gulf states  are boosting power supply to meet
rising demand from growing populations and as they seek
investment to spur economic growth. Abu Dhabi is beginning an
atomic-energy program to diversify supply.  To contact the reporters on this story:
