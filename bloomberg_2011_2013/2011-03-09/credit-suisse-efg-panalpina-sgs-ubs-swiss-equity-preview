The following is a list of companies
whose shares may have unusual price changes in Zurich. Stock
symbols are in parentheses after company names. Share prices are
from the last close.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies added 0.2 percent to 6,511.21 in Zurich. The
broader Swiss Performance Index gained 0.3 percent, to 5,907.56.    Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  : The drugmaker said its board is
“independent, diverse and experienced.” A “white paper” on
its website gives “detailed information” on the board and its
approach to corporate governance, the company said. The shares
increased 0.6 percent to 50.40 Swiss francs.    Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  : Switzerland’s second-
biggest lender agreed to sell its 2.77 percent stake in Bank of
Moscow to VTB Group, Kommersant reported, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the matter. The shares increased 0.1
percent to 40.48 francs.    EFG International AG (EFGN)  : The Swiss bank controlled
by Greek billionaire Spiro Latsis and his family reported a net
loss of 721.8 million francs ($771 million) compared with a
profit of 101.1 million francs a year earlier. The mean estimate
of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a loss of 615
million francs. The shares gained 0.8 percent to 13.50 francs.    Novartis AG (NOVN)  : The Basel, Switzerland-based
drugmaker’s new treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease works in the lower of two proposed doses, a U.S. panel
said. Outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted
15-2 in favor of the 75-microgram dose of indacaterol. The
shares fell 0.8 percent to 51.90 francs.    Panalpina Welttransport Holding AG (PWTN)  : The Swiss
freight forwarder reported a profit of 32.9 million francs in
the fourth quarter after a loss of 11 million francs a year
earlier. The shares lost 0.8 percent to 123.50 francs.    SGS SA (SGSN)  : The world’s largest inspection company
started off “very well” this year, with “pleasing” growth in
most divisions, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kirk told Finanz
und Wirtschaft in an interview. For the full year, growth of a
“high single-digit percentage” should be possible, the
newspaper quoted Kirk as saying. The shares added 0.1 percent to
1,608 francs.    UBS AG (UBSN)  : Switzerland’s biggest bank said its
profit margins in Asia may shrink for as long as two years as
competition for bankers in the world’s fastest-growing major
economies drives up compensation costs. The shares advanced 1.3
percent to 18.20 francs.    Valiant Holding (VATN)  AG: The bank said full-year net
profit dropped 18 percent to 122.5 million francs. The shares
dropped 1.3 percent to 130.90 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
