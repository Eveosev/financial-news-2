  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  ordered
25 planes from Airbus SAS and  Boeing Co. (BA) , betting on further
growth in Asian travel after profit almost tripled last year.  The carrier, Hong Kong’s biggest, rose the most in almost
five months on the city’s stock exchange after announcing deals
to buy 15 Airbus A330-300s and 10 Boeing 777-300ERs. Net income
jumped to HK$14 billion ($1.8 billion) last year from HK$4.7
billion a year earlier, it said separately.  The airline also may buy 14 more planes, it said without
elaborating, as incoming-Chief Executive Officer John Slosar
prepares for rising Asian  travel demand  and growing competition
in the carrier’s home market. Rival Hong Kong Airlines yesterday
agreed to order 38 Boeing widebody planes.  “Cathay needs to renew its fleet and further expand,”
said  Jim Wong , a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst in Hong Kong.
“Passengers prefer taking new planes.”  The carrier will lease two A350-900s from International
Lease Finance Corp. in addition to the 30 it ordered last year,
it said in a press release. The 27 planes announced today, all
of which will be delivered by 2015, raised the value of the
carrier’s backlog to about HK$185 billion at list prices, it
said. Planemakers usually give customers discounts.  Capacity Growth  This year, the carrier will boost passenger capacity 11
percent and increase cargo capacity 12 percent, said Slosar, who
moves up to CEO from chief operating officer on March 31. The
airline is due to add 15 new planes this year, including six
freighters.  Passenger and cargo yields, a measure of average fares,
have returned “most of the way” to levels reached before the
global recession, Slosar said at a press briefing in Hong Kong.  The airline recommended a final dividend of 78 Hong Kong
cents, up from 10 Hong Kong cents a year earlier. Its shares
rose 4.5 percent to close at HK$18.94 today, the best
performance in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   Profit last year included a HK$2.5 billion contribution
from its stake in Beijing-based  Air China Ltd. (601111) , the nation’s
largest international carrier. It also had HK$2.2 billion of
one-time gains from the sale of stakes in a cargo handler and a
plane-maintenance company.  Sales Increase  Sales climbed 34 percent to HK$89.5 billion, the airline
said. The carrier was expected to make a full-year profit of
HK$13.4 billion based on the average of 15 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Cathay said in November that full-year
net income would be at least HK$12.5 billion.  The airline now has 91 aircraft on order, including leases,
for delivery by 2019, it said. It plans to retire its 21 Boeing
747-400s and 11 Airbus A340-300s by the end of the decade. The
carrier had a total fleet of 167 planes at the end of last year.  “We need to keep pace with what we see in the growth in
Hong Kong’s economy and the increasing opportunities our
integration with the mainland  China  will bring,” said Chairman
Christopher Pratt.  Last year, passenger numbers, including at unit Hong Kong
Dragon Airlines Ltd., jumped 9.1 percent to 26.8 million as
business and leisure travelers resumed flying because of the
global economic pickup. Yields, a measure of average fares,
climbed 20 percent. Cargo volumes rose 18 percent and freight
yields surged 25 percent.  Cargo growth will probably cool “a little bit” this year
as 2010 was an “extraordinary year” with the end of the global
recession and the introduction of Apple Inc.’s IPhone and IPad
stoking demand, Slosar said.  Cargo Cooling  “It’s impossible to maintain such a strong growth rate,”
said Kelvin Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Daiwa Institute of
Research. “Cargo is sure to slow.”  Cathay may face slower demand this year as China tightens
lending and oil trades near its highest since 2008. The price of
fuel, which accounted for 36 percent of costs last year, is also
now higher than the carrier had predicted, it said.  The carrier has hedged from 20 percent to 30 percent of its
fuel needs over the next one-to-three years, said Chief
Financial Officer James Hughes-Hallett. The carrier is generally
shortening the length of its hedging positions to two years or
less, he said.  “Demand is still very strong, but mostly people are
concerned about the fuel prices,” Wong said. “Still, it’s
different from what happened in 2008. This time, demand is out
there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
