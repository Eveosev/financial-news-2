The following is the text of
the U.S. wholesale inventories report from the Commerce
Department.  Intention to Revise:  Monthly Wholesale sales, inventories, and
inventories/sales ratios will be revised based on results
of the 2009 Annual Wholesale Trade Survey and the final
results of the 2007 Economic Census. Revised unadjusted
and corresponding adjusted estimates are scheduled to be
released on our website on March 31, 2011.  Sales  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that January
2011 sales of merchant wholesalers, except manufacturers'
sales branches and offices, after adjustment for seasonal
variations and trading-day differences but not for price
changes, were $387.0 billion, up 3.4 percent (+/-0.7%)
from the revised December level and were up 15.4 percent
(+/-1.4%) from the January 2010 level.  The December
preliminary estimate was revised upward $2.7 billion or
0.7 percent.  January sales of durable goods were up 2.3
percent (+/-0.9%) from last month and were up 14.5 percent
(+/-1.4%) from a year ago. Compared to last month, sales
of  motor vehicle  and motor vehicle parts and supplies were
up 7.8 percent and sales of electrical and electronic
goods were up 3.4 percent. Sales of nondurable goods were
up 4.4 percent (+/-0.9%) from last month and were up 16.2
percent (+/-2.1%) from last year.  Sales of petroleum and
petroleum products were up 10.6 percent from last month
and sales of farm product raw materials were up 5.7
percent.  Inventories  Total inventories of merchant wholesalers, except
manufacturers' sales branches and offices, after
adjustment for seasonal variations but not for price
changes, were $436.9 billion at the end of January, up 1.1
percent (+/-0.5%) from the revised December level and were
up 11.9 percent (+/-1.4%) from a year ago.  The December
preliminary estimate was revised upward $1.5 billion or
0.3 percent. End-of-month inventories of durable goods
were up 1.1 percent (+/-0.5%) from last month and were up
9.4 percent (+/-1.6%) from last January. Inventories of
computer and computer peripheral equipment and software
were up 4.1 percent and inventories of hardware, and
plumbing and heating equipment and supplies were up 2.4
percent from last month.  End-of-month inventories of
nondurable goods increased 1.2 percent (+/-0.9%) from
December and were up 15.7 percent (+/-2.1%) compared to
last January. Inventories of petroleum and petroleum
products were up 3.5 percent from last month and
inventories of grocery and related products were up 2.9
percent.  Monthly Wholesale Trade for February is scheduled to be
released April 8, 2011 at 10:00 a.m. EDT.  * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero.  The
Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical
evidence to conclude that the actual change is different
from zero.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.
