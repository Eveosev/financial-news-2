Slovakia’s regulator canceled a
tender to modernize part of the country’s rail track, in which  Skanska AB (SKAB)  placed the lowest offer.  The Office for Public Procurement canceled the contest
called by the state-owned railway company because it was non-
transparent and discriminated some contestants, the regulator’s
spokesman Branislav Zvara said today in an e-mailed statement
from the capital Bratislava.  The Swedish builder had offered to upgrade a 12 kilometers
(7.5 mile) section of track for allow for higher speeds at a
cost of 201 million euros ($279 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
