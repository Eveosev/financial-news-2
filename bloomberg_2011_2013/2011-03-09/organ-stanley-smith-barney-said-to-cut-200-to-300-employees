  Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, will eliminate between 200 and 300 trainees
and financial advisers at its retail brokerage, according to a
person briefed on the decision.  The cuts will target low-producing brokers and bring the
number of  advisers  close to 17,800 from 18,043 on Dec. 31, said
the person, who declined to be named because the decision hasn’t
been made public. Christine Pollak, a spokeswoman for the New
York-based company, declined to comment.  Morgan Stanley paid $2.75 billion in 2009 to win control of
a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.’s  Smith Barney , giving it
the world’s biggest brokerage. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer  James Gorman  said in November that the firm intends to
buy the remaining stake on target dates established in the
original deal.  Weeding out the worst-performers may help boost the firm’s
revenue per adviser, which climbed to an annualized $742,000 in
the fourth quarter, up 7 percent from a year earlier. Bank of
America’s  Merrill Lynch  brokerage, its largest competitor, had
$854,000 in revenue per adviser for 2010.  Dow Jones Newswires reported the employee cuts earlier
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
