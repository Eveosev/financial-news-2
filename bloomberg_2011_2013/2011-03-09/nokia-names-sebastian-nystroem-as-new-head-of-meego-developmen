Nokia Oyj, the world’s largest maker
of mobile phones, appointed Sebastian Nystroem to take charge of
its MeeGo team, replacing Alberto Torres who left the company
last month.  Nystroem will be in charge of putting out a handset running
the Linux-based operating system this year, Peter Schneider,
Nokia’s head of MeeGo marketing, wrote on the MeeGo blog.   Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop announced Feb. 11 that
the company will scale back its MeeGo program and use
Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7 as its main smartphone software.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and the Linux Foundation are also involved in
developing on the MeeGo platform.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
