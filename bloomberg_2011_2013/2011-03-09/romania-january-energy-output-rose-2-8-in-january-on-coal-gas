Romanian energy production increased
an annual 2.8 percent in January as rising coal and gas output
offset a decline in crude oil production.  Total output rose to 2 million metric tons of oil
equivalent, the National Statistics Institute in Bucharest said
in an e-mailed statement today. Energy imports dropped 3.7
percent to 0.8 million tons.  Crude oil output shrank 3.3 percent to about 0.3 million
tons of oil equivalent, while natural-gas production rose 1.8
percent to 0.8 million tons, the institute said. Coal production
increased 4.2 percent to 0.5 million tons of oil equivalent,
according to the institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
