  Canada ’s dollar advanced to the
highest level in more than three years against its U.S.
counterpart amid speculation investors will continue to flock to
the higher returns of the nation’s fixed-income securities.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, gained against 14
of the 16 most-traded currencies as the  Bank of Canada  sold C$3
billion ($3.1 billion) of two-year bonds at an average yield of
1.867 percent, more than double the yield available on
comparable U.S. Treasuries.  “Yields are a more compelling explanation of the strength
of the Canadian dollar,” said  Marc Chandler , global head of
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in  New York .
“The Bank of Canada has already taken action to normalize
money-market conditions so bonds are giving high yield and still
benefiting from the economic recovery.”  The loonie appreciated 0.3 percent to 96.85 cents per  U.S.
dollar  at 5:00 p.m. in Toronto, from 97.14 yesterday. It touched
96.68, the strongest level since Nov. 15, 2007. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0325.  Government bonds rose, pushing the yield on the 10-year
benchmark down six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
3.34 percent. The price of the 3.50 percent security maturing in
June 2020 added 46 cents to C$101.27.  Canada’s sale of C$3 billion of 1.75 percent bonds due in
March 2013 received bids of C$8.1 billion, according to a
statement on the Bank of Canada’s website.  Yields on the 1.75 percent bond fell four basis points to
1.85 percent. That’s 85 basis points more than the central
bank’s key policy rate, compared with a spread of about 75 basis
points when Canada last sold two-year debt on Jan. 26.  The difference between yields on two-year Canadian  government bonds  and U.S. Treasuries of the same maturity were
unchanged at 116 basis points.  New York Oil  Crude oil for April delivery in New York trading decreased
0.6 percent to $104.43 a barrel, after touching $105.44 this
week, the highest on a closing basis since Sept. 26, 2008.
Prices are up 28 percent from a year ago.  Ras Lanuf, which has  Libya ’s biggest refinery as well as a
tanker terminal, was shut amid fighting between government
forces and rebels, an official with the Libyan Emirates Oil
Refining Co. said.  Crude oil supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for U.S. benchmark grade West Texas Intermediate, surged 1.69
million barrels to 40.3 million last week, the highest level
since the Energy Department began gather data at the hub.  “Canadian strength is based on fundamental commodity
strength, a flight to the Canadian dollars from global investors
and long-term asset players, and we’re seeing some real M&A
deals that are coming across the border,” said Firas Askari,
head currency trader in Toronto at Bank of Montreal.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slid 0.9 percent,
while the  S&P 500 Index  dropped 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
