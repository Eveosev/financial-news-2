China’s benchmark stock index rose
above the 3,000 level for the first time in four months, as
lower  oil prices  spurred an advance for industrial companies.    China CSSC Holdings Ltd. (600150) , a unit of the biggest shipbuilder,
climbed to a 19-month high. PetroChina Co. and coal producer
China Shenhua Energy Co. paced losses by energy companies as
crude fell for a second day. Poly Real Estate Group Co. slid 1
percent, leading declines among developers, on concern the
government will take further steps to cool property speculation.  “The retreat in oil prices is a relief, but that’s only
temporary,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at
Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “Inflation
isn’t going to abate soon and is still a major threat to the
economy this year.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, gained for a fourth day, adding 2.21,
or 0.1 percent, to 3,002.15 at the 3 p.m. close, the first close
above 3,000 since Nov. 15. About six stocks fell for every five
that rose. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose less than 0.1 percent to
3,338.86.  The Shanghai index has rallied 12 percent from this year’s
low on Jan. 25, making it the best performer among  Asia ’s major
markets in 2011, on signs the world’s second-biggest economy is
withstanding tighter monetary policies. Manufacturing expanded
in January even after the central bank boosted banks’ reserve
requirement ratio eight times since the start of 2010 and raised  interest rates  three times to cool inflation.  Inflation Outlook  A Chinese inflation rate of 4.4 percent in February is the
“more believable” of market speculation about the number due
this week, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said. The market is
also “whispering” inflation of 3.9 percent, it said.  Investors may get a “positive surprise” as inflation
cools by more than economists had forecast, Hong Kong-based
analyst Lu Ting said. In January, inflation was 4.9 percent.  The median forecast of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News is 4.8 percent for February inflation. The number is due to
be released in Beijing on March 11. Consumer prices rose 4.9
percent in January.  A gauge tracking industrial companies climbed 0.8 percent
on the CSI 300.  China  CSSC rallied 6 percent to 84.39 yuan, its
highest close since August 2009. China First Heavy Industries
Co., a maker of equipment used in the mining and energy
industries, rose 3.4 percent to 6.98 yuan. China Erzhong Group
Deyang Heavy Industries Co., an equipment supplier to power
producers, added 2.2 percent to 14.67 yuan.  Offshore Oil Engineering Co., a unit of the country’s
third-largest oil producer, surged 6.6 percent to 9.39 yuan.
Shenyin & Wanguo raised its recommendation on the company to
“outperform” from “hold.” Offshore Oil will benefit from
parent Cnooc Ltd.’s plan to boost expenditures in deep-water
exploration, Wang Sheng and Li Yamin, analysts at the Shanghai-
based brokerage, wrote in a report today.  Oil Prices  Oil dropped for a second day in  New York  as members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries considered talks
about increasing production because violence is disrupting
supplies from  Libya .  The contract for April delivery decreased as much as 0.8
percent to $104.21 a barrel in after-hours trading today.
Yesterday, it lost 0.4 percent from the previous settlement of
$105.44, the highest since Sept. 26, 2008, to $105.02.  PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil company, slipped 0.7
percent to 12 yuan. Shenhua, the largest coal producer, lost 1.5
percent to 28.59 yuan. China Coal Energy Co., the second biggest,
slid 0.9 percent to 11.50 yuan.  ‘Relief Rally’  Chinese stocks may rally 13 percent in the four weeks
following the National People’s Congress that ends on March 14,
CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets said, citing the average gain for the
MSCI China Index after meetings since 2006.  “NPC announcements are generally pro-growth, so it’s
positive for the market and that’s why people buy,” CLSA
analyst Francis Cheung said in a phone interview from  Hong Kong .
“The market is in an interesting phase because China did pretty
badly last year, so stocks are pretty cheap and you may get a
relief rally.”  The government will target 8 percent economic expansion
this year and “decisively” curb increases in prices that may
threaten social stability, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in his state-
of-the-nation report on the opening session of the NPC.  A gauge of property stocks on the Shanghai Composite lost
0.6 percent. Poly Real Estate, the second-largest developer,
slid 1 percent to 13.19 yuan.  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  lost 0.7 percent to
6.72 yuan.  Rising property market in the past few years was driven in
part by “unreasonable” demand from speculators, Qi Ji, Vice
Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, in a press
briefing in Beijing today.  Curb Target  “The government’s property curbs are targeted principally
at those who don’t have an immediate need for housing as
accommodation,” Qi said. “Our basic aim is to direct the
limited supply of housing to those who need it the most.”  China may introduce a new round of control measures on the
real estate market if property prices do not stabilize, China
Securities Journal reported today, citing Jiang Weixin, minister
of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. The government may work
out more detailed measures on how to contain the gains in
property prices, the newspaper quoted Jiang as saying.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
