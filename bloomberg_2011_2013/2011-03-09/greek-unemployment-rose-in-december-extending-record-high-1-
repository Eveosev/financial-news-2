  Greece ’s unemployment rate climbed
for a sixth month in December, increasing more than economists
estimated as it extended a record high.  The unemployment rate rose to 14.8 percent from 13.9
percent in November, the  Hellenic Statistical Authority  said
today in an e-mailed statement from  Athens . The rate, which was
higher than the median 14.5 percent estimate of three economists
in a Bloomberg News survey, set a new record high after reaching
12.2 percent in August, the highest since Greece began releasing
monthly jobless figures in 2004.  The total number of jobless was 733,645, as the economy
lost 73,290 jobs compared with November and 223,893 jobs from a
year earlier. The  unemployment rate  for those under age 24
reached 39 percent. Unemployment was worst in the Ionian
Islands, where the rate was 23.1 percent.  Greece’s economy contracted 4.5 percent last year as the
recession, now entering its third year, was exacerbated by
austerity measures implemented in exchanged for a 110 billion-
euro ($153 billion) bailout from the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund . The EU and the IMF forecast that
unemployment will average 14.6 percent this year as the economy
contracts 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
