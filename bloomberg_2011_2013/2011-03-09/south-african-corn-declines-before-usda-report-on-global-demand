Corn prices fell in  South Africa ,
the largest producer of the grain in the continent, ahead of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture world supply and demand estimate
scheduled for tomorrow.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, fell 12 rand, or 0.7
percent, to 1,660 rand ($241) a metric ton at the 12 p.m. close
in Johannesburg. Meal made from the grain is the country’s
staple food.  “There is a bit of a mixed bag of trading,” Rudi
Swanepoel, a trader at Farmwise Grains Ltd. said today by phone
from Johannesburg. “Everybody is waiting for the USDA report.”
There is “uncertainty” over the report’s contents, Klerksdorp-
based grain storage company Senwes Ltd. said on its website
today.  Yellow corn for July delivery declined 19 rand, or 1.1
percent, to 1,692 rand a ton in Johannesburg. The country mainly
uses the grain as  animal feed .  Wheat for May delivery fell 24 rand, or 0.8 percent, to
3,085 rand a ton.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
