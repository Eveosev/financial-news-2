  Land Securities Group Plc (LAND) , the

countryâ€™s few substantial retail developments since the crash in
the commercial  property market , the Financial Times reported.  The development, which also includes a residential element,
will be in Buchanan Street, Glasgow; Land Securities is likely
to sign U.S. fashion chain Forever 21 as an anchor tenant today,
