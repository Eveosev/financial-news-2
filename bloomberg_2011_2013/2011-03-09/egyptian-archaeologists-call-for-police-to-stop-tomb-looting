Egyptian archaeologists called today
on Prime Minister Essam Sharaf to return police guards to
antiquity sites to stop looting of tombs and storehouses.  “The desecration of archaeological sites and monuments is
not only a huge loss for the people of  Egypt  on a national,
economic, and human level, but is also a loss to all of humanity
and to science,” Tarek El Awadi, director of the Egyptian
museum, said in an open letter to Sharaf.  The country’s antiquities are in “grave danger” from
looters following the revolution that ousted President Hosni Mubarak last month,  Zahi Hawass , the then Minister of State for
Antiquities Affairs, said last week.  Across Egypt, storage magazines have been broken into
including that of the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art’s expedition in
Dahshur, which was attacked twice by looters who overpowered
guards and tied them up, Hawass said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
