Turkish stocks rose for a second day
as banks advanced after the anti-trust regulator fined lenders
less than analysts expected.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  of stocks climbed 1,182.18, or
1.9 percent, to 62,483.83 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul.
Bonds gained, sending the yield on benchmark two-year debt 10
basis points lower to 9.01 percent, according to the RBS
Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index. The lira strengthened 0.5 percent
to 1.5811 per dollar.  The stock exchange’s index of banking shares climbed 3.8
percent, bringing its gain in the past two days to 6.6 percent,
after the regulator’s decision.  The anti-trust board fined seven banks 72 million liras
($45 million) for breaching regulations by reaching an agreement
between them over handling salary payments made by business
customers, Erkan Yardimci, deputy chief of the board, told
reporters in Ankara yesterday.  “There were fears that the fines would be very high, but
it was seen that the fine was not a significant sum,” Tufan Comert, a strategist at Garanti Securities in Istanbul, said in
e-mailed comments.    Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  increased 3.6 percent to 7.46
liras, its highest level in more than two weeks.  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) 
gained 4.5 percent to 7.42 liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
