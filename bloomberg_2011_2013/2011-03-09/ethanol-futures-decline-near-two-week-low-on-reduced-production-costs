Ethanol futures in  Chicago  fell to
the lowest price in almost two weeks on signs of reduced
production costs to make the biofuel.  The gasoline additive slipped as corn fell for a fourth
day, decreasing the cost to make the alternative fuel. One
bushel of corn distills into about 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  “You didn’t have the underlying support from crude oil,”
said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 1.8 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.543 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
lowest price since Feb. 24. Futures are up 6.9 percent this
year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf plunged 5
cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.605 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive lost 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.56, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  decreased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.66 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel increased 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.70.  Corn futures for May delivery slid 4.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to close at $7.01 a bushel. It was the longest series
of declines since Nov. 12. One bushel of the grain makes about
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Crude oil for April delivery dropped 64 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $104.38 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract touched $106.95 on March 7, the highest
intraday price since Sept. 26, 2008. Ethanol is part of U.S.
energy plans to reduce dependence on oil.  An average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is breaking even on every
gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing about 3
cents, according to Ag Trader Talk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
