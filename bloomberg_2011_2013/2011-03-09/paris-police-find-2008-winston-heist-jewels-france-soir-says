French police searching a sewer in a
Paris suburb recovered some of the jewels stolen from a Harry
Winston Inc. shop in Paris in 2008,  France Soir  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Acting on a tip-off, the police found 18 rings and three
earrings with an estimated value of more than 13.4 million euros
($18.6 million) in a sewer pipe in Seine-Saint-Denis, just north
of Paris, the newspaper said.  The Harry Winston store on the Avenue Montaigne, one of
Parisâ€™ most prestigious shopping districts, was robbed by four
armed men, two of them dressed as women, in mid-afternoon on
Dec. 4, 2008. The stolen goods were estimated at 85 million
euros at the time.  After first suspecting Serbian mobsters, police soon
narrowed their search to criminal gangs in Paris suburbs. Police
recovered some cash and jewels during a series of raids around
Paris in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
