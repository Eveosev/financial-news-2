U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lower a third time in four days, as
escalating violence in Libya tempered optimism that the biggest
equity rally since 1955 will extend into a third year.    Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and DuPont Co. dropped at least 1 percent,
pacing losses in industrial shares.  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) 
slumped 3.1 percent as the largest analog chipmaker narrowed its
earnings forecast.  Finisar Corp. (FNSR)  tumbled 39 percent, leading
other network-equipment makers lower, as its profit estimate
missed analysts’ projections.  International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  rose 2.2 percent as Deutsche Bank AG lifted its share-
price estimate for the largest computer-services provider.  The S&P 500 dropped 0.1 percent to 1,320.02 at 4 p.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 1.29 points, or
less than 0.1 percent, to 12,213.09 as IBM, which makes up about
10 percent of the Dow, propped up the 30-stock gauge. Oil slid
0.6 percent to settle at $104.38 a barrel as a surge in supplies
at a U.S. hub overshadowed concern about violence in  Libya .  “You’d be crazy not to be concerned about geopolitical
risks,” said Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at
Minneapolis-based RBC Wealth Management, which oversees $164
billion. “Oil touches everything. However, if you’ve paid
attention to every near-term uncertainty of the last two years,
you would have missed the big move in stocks. You can’t see the
forest for the trees. There’s not enough evidence that this
could derail the global recovery. This is an expansion.”  Middle East Unrest  The S&P 500 has fallen 1.7 percent from this year’s highest
level on Feb. 18 as crude oil surged amid unrest in Libya and
the Middle East. The benchmark for U.S. equities has rallied 95
percent from its bear-market low two years ago on government
stimulus measures and as corporate earnings beat analysts’
estimates for eight straight quarters.  Libya’s Ras Lanuf refinery, the country’s largest crude-
processing plant, was shut amid fighting between government
forces and rebels, an official with the Libyan Emirates Oil
Refining Co. said. Oil tanks at the nearby Es Sider terminal
were damaged by bombings today, according to Al Jazeera
television.  While some use “these issues to paint a gloomy picture, we
remain optimistic and believe this ‘wall of worry’ will help
elongate the bull run,” said Kully Samra, who manages U.K.-
based clients for Charles Schwab Corp., which has $1.5 trillion
in client assets. “The general trend in stocks continues to be
higher despite increasing concerns over inflation, debt, global
conflict, rising interest rates and  oil prices .”  $28 Trillion Restored  Laszlo Birinyi, who told clients to buy as the  S&P 500  fell
to a 12-year low of 676.53 on March 9, 2009, says gains that
added about $28 trillion to global share values will outlast
previous increases as investors who missed the first phase play
catch-up. Valuations are still below historical averages, said  Barton Biggs , the hedge-fund manager who purchased stocks before
the S&P 500 almost doubled.  “These kinds of strong beginnings lead to long and durable
bull markets,” Birinyi, who founded Westport, Connecticut-based
research and money management firm  Birinyi Associates Inc.  in
1989 after a decade on the trading desk at  Salomon Brothers ,
said in a March 7 phone interview. “While there will be
corrections and while there will be pauses, we’re still of the
view that this is a  bull market  that we expect to go on for
several years.”  Valuations  Five straight quarters of U.S. profit growth and the
biggest yearly increase since 1988 have held down valuations,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. benchmark
index is trading at 15.5 times reported earnings, compared with
the average ratio of 19.7 at bull-market peaks.  The proportion of investment publications that are
forecasting a stock market correction, or 10 percent drop,
declined to a four-month low of 26.7 percent between March 2 and
yesterday, according to  Investors Intelligence , which has
examined forecasts in newsletters since 1963. Newsletter writers
who are bullish rose to 52.2 percent, the highest since Jan 11,
while bearish publications climbed to 21.1 percent, the highest
in a month.  Stocks of industries which are most dependent on economic
growth, including commodity producers, technology and industrial
companies, led the declines in the S&P 500.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, lost 1.7 percent to $102.36. DuPont, the third-
biggest U.S. chemical maker, slid 1 percent to $53.71.  Texas Instruments Slumps  Texas Instruments fell 3.1 percent to $34.74. The largest
analog chipmaker narrowed its first-quarter profit estimate to
56 cents to 60 cents a share from 54 cents to 62 cents. The
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey was 59 cents.   Finisar tumbled 39 percent to $24.61 for its biggest
decline since going public in 1999. The maker of fiber-optic
transmission gear said it won’t earn more than 35 cents a share
excluding some items in the fourth quarter, missing the average
analyst estimate of 48 cents.  Other makers of networking equipment also slumped.  JDS
Uniphase Corp. (JDSU)  fell 17 percent, the biggest drop in the S&P 500,
to $21.14.  Ciena Corp. (CIEN)  slumped 5.3 percent to $24.33.  IBM rose 2.2 percent to $165.86, the biggest increase in
the Dow, and touched an all-time high of $167.72. Deutsche Bank
raised its share-price estimate for the computer-services
provider to $200 from $175. There is “ample flexibility” for
IBM to beat its forecast of generating at least $20 a share by
2015 given its revenue growth, productivity gains and share
buybacks, analyst Chris Whitmore wrote in a note to clients.  Retailers advanced as  American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO) 
reported fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations of 44
cents, beating the average analyst estimate by 1 cent. The
Pittsburgh-based company climbed 5.1 percent to $15.56.  J.C. Penney Co. rallied 4.8 percent to $36.94, the biggest
increase in the S&P 500.  Macy’s Inc. (M)  rose 3 percent to $24.08.  To contact the reporters on this story:
