The next round of stress tests on
banks in the European Union will be tougher than last year’s
because the results of shocks on refinancing costs will be
included,  Handelsblatt  cited Jochen Sanio, head of  Germany ’s
BaFin financial regulator, as saying.  Sanio rejected calls to include a possible collapse of the
euro in the tests, saying euro-region governments have created a
backstop to protect against that possibility, the German
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
