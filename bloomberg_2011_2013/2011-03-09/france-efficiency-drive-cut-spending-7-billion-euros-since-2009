The French government cut spending
by 7 billion euros ($9.8 billion) since 2009 under an efficiency
program that included new software to centralize accounting and
a push for the sale of real estate.  The plan initiated by President  Nicolas Sarkozy  forced
ministries to freeze their budgets. The state cut its payroll by
100,000 by not replacing one of every two retiring civil
servants, saving 2.7 billion euros, Budget Minister Francois Baroin told reporters today in Paris.  Sarkozy aims to cut the deficit to 6 percent of gross
domestic product this year from about 7.7 percent in 2010. On
Feb. 17, the auditor told the government that efforts to cut the  budget deficit  to 3 percent of output by 2013 may not be enough
amid sluggish economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
