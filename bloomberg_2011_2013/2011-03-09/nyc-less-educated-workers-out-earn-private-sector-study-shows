New York City public workers without
college degrees earn “significantly” more than they’d expect
to get at private companies, even as municipal employees receive
17% less on average, a study for city Comptroller  John Liu 
found.  City employees, including janitors, firefighters, teachers
and accountants, who are eligible for partial pensions with less
than 20 years on the job, also pay less for benefits than
corporate workers who don’t get promised sums upon retirement,
according to  the study , released today and based on census and
labor data.  “Our analysis indicates that less-educated, lower-paid
city civilian workers are paid a premium over the wages they
could be expected to earn in the private for-profit sector,”
said the study by Frank Braconi, Liu’s chief economist.
Conversely, the pay of those with more education tends to be
“significantly” less than in the private sector, the study
shows.  Liu, 44, a Democrat elected in 2009 after two terms in City
Council, oversees five pension funds holding assets of more than
$113 billion, with an enrollment of more than 700,000 current
and retired workers.  ‘Income Gap’  The study doesn’t signal that less-educated municipal
employees are overpaid, Liu said.  “In recent years we have seen a divergence in the income
gap here,” Liu said today at a news conference. “It is more
fitting for city government to not have such a wide, disparate
pay range.”  Mayor  Michael Bloomberg , 69, last month presented a $65.6
billion preliminary budget for next fiscal year warning that
pension costs would rise to about $8 billion in 2012 from $1.5
billion in 2002. To close a $2.4 billion deficit, he proposed
reducing the city’s 75,000 teachers by 6,166, with plans to fire
4,666. He is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent
Bloomberg LP.  Wages, salaries, pensions and other fringe benefits totaled
about $36.9 billion, or about 55 percent of the city budget this
fiscal year, the study said.  National Debate  Liu said he released the report with the goal of providing
research on what has become a contentious national debate over
government workers’ compensation.  Sixty-three percent of Americans don’t think states should
be able to break their promises to retirees, according to a
Bloomberg National Poll conducted March 4-7.  Republican Governor Scott Walker’s proposal to curb
collective bargaining power for most Wisconsin public employees
sparked protests across the U.S.  Private employees get about 71 percent of their
compensation in salary and 29 percent as fringe benefits, while
state and local government workers receive about 66 percent as
wages and 34 percent in retirement and health care, the report
states, citing the U.S.  Bureau of Labor Statistics National
Compensation Survey .  New York, the 11th-largest U.S. employer with 306,000
workers, trails only California and  Texas  in the size of its
public payroll, the report said.  Salary Range  From 2006 to 2008, janitors working for the city earned an
average $32,143, compared with $26,357 in local private firms;
security guards got $35,423 versus $26,571 at private companies;
and bus drivers made about $48,000 on the public payroll
compared with about $36,000 at for-profit firms, the study said.  Conversely, municipal workers with college and post-
graduate degrees earn less than private-company workers, the
study said.  City physicians and surgeons earned an average $120,086
compared with $137,183 in private practice. Lawyers for the city
earned about $88,000, or 40 percent of their for-profit
counterparts; and accountants and auditors got about half of
their private-sector counterparts’ wages, according to the
study.  The  New York  City Employees Retirement  System , which covers
165,000 current and 122,000 retired city workers excluding
police, firefighters, teachers, pays pensions equal to 1.67
percent of final salary multiplied by years of service for those
with less than 20 years, and 2 percent for those with 20 to 30
years. Someone retiring at 62 after working 30 years would get
60 percent of their salary. In 2007 the annual benefit averaged
$45,406 for those with 30 to 34.9 years of service, the report
said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
