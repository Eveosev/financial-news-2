  Palm oil  closed little changed on
speculation that rising soybean oil supplies from  Argentina  and  Brazil  may cool demand for the tropical commodity.  The May-delivery contract gained as much as 1 percent and
declined as much as 0.8 percent before closing little changed at
3,585 ringgit ($1,182) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. Futures slumped 3 percent yesterday.  “The market is under pressure as soybean arrivals have
started in Brazil and Argentina,” Prasoon Mathur, an analyst at
Religare Commodities Ltd. said by phone from  New Delhi . “Demand
from main palm oil consumers such as  India  is also low because
of satisfactory local supplies.”  India, the biggest palm oil buyer, may trim purchases this
year as the nation’s cooking oil output increases,  Dorab Mistry ,
director of Godrej International Ltd., told a conference today.  Palm oil may test the 4,000 ringgit mark in the next few
weeks on high energy prices, tight stockpiles and pent-up
demand, Mistry said in  Kuala Lumpur .  “I expect current high prices to remain intact for the
next 8 to 10 weeks and during that time to test new highs,” he
said. A “sharp correction would not be unexpected” around May
or June, followed by a “strong recovery” from August, when
palm oil may trade from 3,600 to 4,000 ringgit, Mistry said.  Futures have lost 9.6 percent after reaching a 35-month
high of 3,967 ringgit on Feb. 10. Prices reached a record 4,486
ringgit in March 2008.  Output, Inventories  Palm oil may decline from May or June as production and
stockpiles recover, Thomas Mielke, executive director of Oil
World, said at the conference. Futures may average 2,850 ringgit
in October to December this year, he said. Prices have averaged
about 3,730 ringgit this year, according to Bloomberg data.  Soybean oil may trade at about 70 cents a pound, from about
58 cents today, and its premium over palm will widen to a record
$200 a ton “as winter sets in,” said Godrej’s Mistry. Palm oil
tends to cloud over in winter, stoking demand for soybean oil.  “This is going to be a year of high volatility and high
excitement,” Mistry said. “We must be prepared for volatility
like we have never been experienced before.”  Soybean oil for May delivery fell as much as 0.6 percent to
58.11 cents on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at 58.38 cents
at 6:27 p.m. in  Singapore . May-delivery soybeans shed as much as
0.5 percent to $13.75 a bushel.  Palm and soybean oils are substitutes in food and fuel
uses, and prices can be influenced by shifts in energy costs.  Biofuel Demand  Biodiesel demand is expected to grow by 2.5 million tons
globally this year, while output in the U.S. may rise to 3.3
million tons in 2011, from 1 million tons, Mistry said.  Oil dropped for a second day as members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries considered talks about raising
production as fighting disrupts supplies from  Libya . Oil, which
has risen 28 percent in the past year, dropped as much as 0.8
percent to $104.21 a barrel today.  September-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  fell 1.1 percent to close at 9,388 yuan ($1,429) a ton
and soybean oil for delivery in the same month shed 0.7 percent
to 10,180 yuan.  CME Group Inc.’s most-active June palm-oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, shed as much as 1.1 percent to
$1,166.25 a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
