  Kenya ’s state-owned Geothermal
Development Co. invited tenders to develop eight 100-megawatt,
steam-powered electricity plants at the Bogoria-Silali block in
northwestern Kenya.  Development will begin in July and the project is expected
to be completed by 2017, the company said in a statement
published in the Nairobi-based Standard newspaper today.  Kenya plans to develop 10,000 megawatts from geothermal
steam sources by 2030, shifting the East African nation’s
electricity load from weather-dependent hydropower sources to
renewable geothermal.  GDC, as the company is known, will partner with investors
to finance the development of steam deposits, with GDC treating
investors’ funds as a loan to be repaid through revenue from the
sale of the steam.  “The government of Kenya will not provide sovereign
guarantees relating to the investment,” GDC said in the
statement. It advised potential investors to use other
alternatives such the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency,
a division of the  World Bank  that provides insurance against the
political risks of investing in poor countries.  GDC also expects the investors to successfully negotiate a
power-purchase agreement with state-owned Kenya Power &
Lightning Co. and secure a generating license from the Energy
Regulatory Commission, it said.  Tenders are to be submitted by Aug. 8, GDC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
