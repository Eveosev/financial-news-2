Zinc may fall as much as 5.9 percent
as industrial metals reverse gains, paving the way for copper
and lead to drop, according to  technical analysis  by  Barclays
Capital .  Zinc risks sliding toward $2,250 a metric ton in case of a
“clear” break under the lows of its trading range near $2,425,
Barclays technical analysts including  Philip Roberts  said in a
report dated March 7. Zinc for three-month delivery fell $3.50
to $2,391.50 a ton by 6:33 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.  “At the moment the base-metals markets are in their
uptrend, but they are starting to reverse, and zinc could be
showing the way,” Roberts said by phone yesterday. “We are
waiting for some sort of confirmation, and confirmation will
come from either lead or copper.”  Zinc, used to make steel rust-resistant, is forming a so-
called topping pattern that indicates further losses, according
to Barclays. That would be confirmed if copper and lead were to
fall below respective prices of $9,311 a ton and $2,445 a ton,
according to Roberts.  “We are hanging on to the bullish view, but we are getting
more worried,” he said. Still, copper may head for $10,467 a
ton and zinc may rebound toward $2,900 a ton if industrial
metals continue to climb, the report shows.  Zinc fell 1.2 percent last week on the LME, one of only two
declines among the six main metals traded on the exchange. Tin
also retreated. Zinc has dropped 2.6 percent this year in  London , the worst performance of the main LME metals.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
