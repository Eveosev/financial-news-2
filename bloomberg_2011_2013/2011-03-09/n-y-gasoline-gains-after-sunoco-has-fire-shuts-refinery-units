  New York  Harbor gasoline
strengthened after Sunoco Inc. shut a fluid catalytic cracker
and vacuum tower for repairs.  The cat cracker work may last several weeks and the vacuum
tower is expected to be undergoing repairs for about seven days
after a March 7 fire, according to a person with knowledge of
the situation. Gasoline inventories also declined in the region,
according to government data.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor narrowed 0.87 cent to 15.63 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:11
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
increased 6.67 cents to $2.8484 a gallon.  Gasoline stocks in the East Coast slipped 855,000 barrels
to 63 million last week, according to the Energy Department.  Regular gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  strengthened 0.12 cent
to a discount of 16.88 cents a gallon as of 12:38 p.m.  Four units at Petroleos de Venezuela SAâ€™s Isla refinery in
Curacao have been shut down because of problems at a boiler
unit, Kenneth Gijsbertha, a company spokesman, said today in a
telephone interview without providing additional details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
