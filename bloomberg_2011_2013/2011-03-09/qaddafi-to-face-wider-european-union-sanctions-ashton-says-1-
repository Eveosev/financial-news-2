The European Union plans to widen
sanctions against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  by targeting
organizations linked to him, EU foreign policy chief  Catherine Ashton  said.  Since late February, the 27-nation EU has imposed an arms
embargo on Libya, frozen the assets of Qaddafi and close
associates and barred them from travelling to  Europe  following
his attacks on domestic opponents and the United Nations
Security Council’s backing for sanctions.  “We are now in the process of adding several entities
controlled by Qaddafi and his closest associates to that list,”
Ashton told the European Parliament today in Strasbourg, France.
She didn’t elaborate.  The extra EU measures will extend to Libya’s sovereign-
wealth funds and central bank, which hold billions of euros in
shares of European companies, according to four people informed
of the matter. Officials from EU nations reached the accord
yesterday and it may take effect on March 11, the people said.  The extra sanctions aim to freeze the European holdings of
the  Libyan Investment Authority , its former Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Mustafa Zarti, the Libya Africa Investment
Portfolio, the Libyan Foreign Bank, the Libyan Housing and
Infrastructure Board and the country’s central bank, the people
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
