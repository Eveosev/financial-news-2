  South Korea ’s producer prices
rose at the fastest pace in 27 months, underscoring the
likelihood of the central bank raising  interest rates  today.  Prices increased 6.6 percent in February from a year
earlier, the biggest gain since November 2008, after climbing
6.2 percent in January, the Bank of  Korea  said in a statement in
Seoul today. Prices advanced 0.7 percent from January.  A jump in crude oil costs is escalating the danger of
inflation in Asia, where central banks are already grappling
with price pressures fueled by job and spending gains. In South
Korea, the government says it’s now focusing more on price
stability than growth, after consumer-price inflation topped a
target ceiling of 4 percent for a second month.  “Inflation pressure remains prominent,” Kim Song Yi, an
economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  Hong Kong , said before the
announcement. “Rates, as we’ve long noted, need to go up.”  The Bank of Korea will this morning boost its benchmark
rate by a quarter point to 3 percent, according to all 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Last month, the central
bank unexpectedly held off from boosting rates.  Consumer prices climbed 4.5 percent from a year earlier in
February, the biggest gain in more than two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
