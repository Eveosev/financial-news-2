  Taiwan ’s energy demand rose at the
fastest pace in 10 months as electricity use by factories
increased amid the economic recovery.  Combined consumption of coal, petroleum, gas, thermal
energy and electricity climbed 6.1 percent in January from a
year earlier to the equivalent of 10.3 million kiloliters of oil,
or about 2.09 million barrels a day, according to an e-mailed
report from the  Bureau of Energy  in Taipei today. The increase
was the most since the 16 percent gain in March last year.  Taiwan’s industrial production increased for a 17th
straight month in January, an economic ministry report showed on
Feb. 23. The economy expanded 10.82 percent in 2010, one of the
world’s highest rates based on International Monetary Fund
estimates. The government said last month it forecasts growth of
4.92 percent this year.  Power consumption rose 5.7 percent to 18.6 billion
kilowatt-hours in January, the energy bureau said. Use by
industrial and energy companies, which accounted for 56 percent
of the demand, climbed 11 percent.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest
contract chipmaker, reported last month sales increased 18
percent from a year earlier in January.  Petroleum Products  Consumption of petroleum products declined 0.21 percent to
the equivalent of 4.49 million kiloliters of oil in January,
according to the energy bureau.  The combined utilization rate at crude oil distillation
units operated by  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  and  CPC Corp. ,
Taiwan’s two refiners, rose to 70 percent from 68 percent in
December, the energy bureau said. The units separate crude into
oil products and form the main part of a refinery.  Coal imports gained 2.5 percent to 5.03 million metric tons,
while imports of liquefied natural gas increased 22 percent to
1.11 billion cubic meters, the bureau said.  LNG is natural gas that’s been chilled to liquid form,
reducing it to one-six-hundredth of its original volume for
transportation by ship to destinations not connected by pipeline.
On arrival, it’s turned back into gas for distribution to  power
plants , factories and households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
