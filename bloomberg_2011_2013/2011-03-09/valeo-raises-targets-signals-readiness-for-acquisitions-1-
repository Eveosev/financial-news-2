  Valeo SA (FR) ,  France ’s second-largest
car-parts maker, pledged to outpace global auto production
growth by 3 percent a year to deliver a sales increase of about
45 percent by 2015 as it focuses on fuel-saving technology.  Revenue will rise to about 14 billion euros ($19.5 billion)
at existing businesses, the company predicted in an e-mailed
statement, from 9.63 billion euros last year. Valeo also
forecast a 30 percent return on capital and an operating margin
exceeding 7 percent, and said it’s ready to make acquisitions.  “We want to focus on CO2” and fuel-efficiency, Chief
Executive Officer Jacques Aschenbroich said at a Paris investor
presentation today. “The last few weeks have shown that rising
oil prices are the long-term trend.”  The manufacturer, whose products span windshield wipers,
headlights and hands-free parking devices, has tightened its
focus on hybrid and electric powertrains as a research and
development priority under Aschenbroich.  Valeo rose 0.8 percent to 44.54 euros at 12:23 p.m. in
Paris trading, extending the stock’s gain this year to 4.9
percent and valuing the company at 3.51 billion euros ($4.9
billion).  The company forecast in March last year that it would
achieve 10 billion euros in revenue in 2013 and 15 billion euros
for 2020. At the time the Paris-based parts maker predicted an
operating margin of 6 percent to 7 percent for 2013, which
compares with 6.4 percent achieved last year.  Asian Opportunity  The new 2015 targets are based on expectations of global
auto production increasing by about 5 percent a year from 2011
to 2015, led by annual growth of about 5.8 percent in  Asia , the
French manufacturer said.  Valeo sees opportunities to win more Asian business as the
region’s manufacturers open export channels to  Europe  and  North
America , Aschenbroich said today.  “The Chinese and the Indians are coming and we shouldn’t
fool ourselves that they’re going to stay in India and  China ,”
the CEO told investors.  “They don’t always trust their local, low-quality
suppliers and want to have more traditional, established global
suppliers as they start exporting,” Aschenbroich added.  Valeo predicted today that Asia’s share of global auto
production will increase from 50 percent today to 60 percent in
2020, as Europe’s share shrinks from 27 percent to 22 percent.  While the company will study possible acquisitions,
consolidation will not be a substitute for organic growth,
Aschenbroich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
