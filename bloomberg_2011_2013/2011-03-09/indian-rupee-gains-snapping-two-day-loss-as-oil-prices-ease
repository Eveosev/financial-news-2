  India ’s rupee snapped a two-day loss
as  oil prices  declined, easing concern a surge in crude costs
and disruptions to supply in the Middle East will slow the
global economy.  Crude oil retreated from a 29-month high and the MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of regional shares rose for the first day this
week. Overseas investors bought $306 million more Indian
equities than they sold this month as of March 7, according to
exchange data. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index gained,
adding to yesterday’s biggest increase in a week.  “The decline in oil prices is positive for the rupee,”
said Thio Chin Loo, a senior currency analyst at BNP Paribas SA
in  Singapore . “The stocks are a bit supportive.”  The rupee strengthened 0.2 percent to 44.995 per dollar as
of 9:06 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
paring its loss this year to 0.6 percent. Thio said the rupee
will trade around 44.50 to 46.00 for the next month.  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are considering an urgent meeting to determine whether
more output is needed,  Kuwait ’s oil minister Sheikh Ahmad al-
Abdullah al-Sabah said yesterday.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.76 in
three months, compared with expectations of 45.88 yesterday.
