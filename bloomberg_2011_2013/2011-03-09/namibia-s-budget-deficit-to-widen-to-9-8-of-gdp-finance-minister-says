  Namibia ’s budget deficit will
probably widen to 9.8 percent of gross domestic product in the
2011-12 fiscal year, Finance Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila
said.  The gap will widen from 7 percent in the current fiscal
year on a drop in revenue for a regional customs union, before
narrowing to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2012-13, Kuugongelwa-Amadhila
said in a budget speech today in the capital, Windhoek. The
economy will expand by 4.3 percent this year after growing 4.8
percent in 2010 when increased mining output led the recovery
from recession in 2009, she said.  The government is considering changing mining laws to
ensure Namibians receive more benefit from the nation’s mineral
wealth, Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said.  The southern African nation is the world’s biggest miner of
offshore diamonds, most of which are mined by Namdeb, a joint
venture between the government and  De Beers , the world’s No. 1
diamond company. Namibia is also the world’s fourth-largest
producer of uranium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
