Ukraine’s rapeseed harvest will
probably expand 40 percent this year as farmers increased
planting and more of the crop survived winter weather, according
to UkrAgroConsult.  The harvest will probably increase to 2.06 million metric
tons this year from 1.47 million tons in 2010, the Kiev-based
researcher said in an e-mailed statement. It estimated a harvest
of 2 million tons on March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
