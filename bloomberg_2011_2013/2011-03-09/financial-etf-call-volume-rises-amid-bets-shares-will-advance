Call volume for an exchange-traded
fund tracking financial companies jumped to a three-week high
after two trades with a strike price 7.4 percent above todayâ€™s
close.  A total of 121,061 June $18 calls to buy the  Financial
Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF)  traded for 31 cents at 11:11 a.m. in  New
York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract had
an open interest of 53,178 before today.  Almost 199,000 calls changed hands today, more than twice
the four-week average and 2.3 times the number of puts to sell.
The June $18 calls, which were the most-active contracts,
accounted for more than two-thirds of all call volume and gained
13 percent to 34 cents. The ETF, which tracks companies such as  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) , dropped less than 0.1
percent to $16.77.  Yesterday investors bought about 110,000 Citigroup Inc.
June $5.50 calls and almost 30,000  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  April $34
calls, according to a report yesterday from options strategists
at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP in  Bala Cynwyd ,  Pennsylvania .  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
