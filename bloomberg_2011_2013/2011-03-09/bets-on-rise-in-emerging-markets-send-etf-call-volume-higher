Call volume on an exchange-traded
fund tracking emerging-markets companies surged a second day and
rose to a three-week high as investors placed bets that profit
from gains in the ETF, which has fallen 1.6 percent this year.  An investor bought 40,000 April $50 calls to buy the
iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index and sold as many April $52
calls, a strategy known as a spread, after the same spread was
bought 75,000 times yesterday, according to a report from
options strategists at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP in  Bala
Cynwyd ,  Pennsylvania , and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Separately, 50,169 May $49 calls were bought for $1.02. The ETF
rose 0.2 percent to $46.95 today.  “It’s bullish,” said Alec Levine, a strategist at
Wallachbeth Capital LLC in New York. “It’s a very cheap bet
that the emerging markets are going to rally and break above the
range that they set.”  More than 206,500 calls changed hands today, more than
double the four-week average and 1.4 times the number of puts to
sell. The most-active contracts were the May $49 calls, which
accounted for almost one-third of all call volume and gained 4
percent to $1.05. The ETF hasn’t closed above $49 since June 5,
2008.  China Wagers  Investors also bought 20,000 August $49 calls of the  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , an exchange-traded fund that
tracks companies in the FTSE China 25 Index, Susquehanna’s
report showed. Almost 74,000 calls changed hands, 1.4 times the
average and 1.3 times the number of puts. The August $49 calls
were the most traded and accounted for almost one-third of all
call volume. The China ETF rose 0.7 percent to $44.43. It hasn’t
closed above $49 since June 2008.  “While today’s investors appear to agree that there is
potential for an outsized move, they appear directionally biased
to the upside,” the Susquehanna note said.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
