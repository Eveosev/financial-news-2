Romanian industrial output growth
quickened for a third month in January as manufacturers boosted
production on increased demand for the countryâ€™s exports in
western  Europe .  Production rose 10.6 percent on the year in January, the
fastest since April 2008, after gaining 6.5 percent in December,
the Bucharest-based National Statistics Institute said in an e-
mail today. Output grew 1 percent on the month after a 0.2
percent drop in December.  Industry grew an annual 4.1 percent in 2010, compared with
a decline of 5.7 percent in 2009, helping offset waning domestic
demand as the economy struggles to emerge from the worst
recession on record. Gross domestic product contracted a less-
than-expected in the fourth quarter, shrinking an annual 0.6
percent, helped by industry and agriculture growth.  The  International Monetary Fund , which has been leading a
20 billion-euro ($27.8 billion) bailout to the Balkan nation,
predicts the economy will emerge from recession this year and
post growth of 1.5 percent, led by industrial expansion and
export growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
