Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened as  oil prices  declined for a second day and regional stocks
advanced on improved appetite for higher-yielding assets.  Government bonds  were little changed.  The currency snapped a two-day losing streak after crude
retreated from a 29-month high of $106.95 a barrel reached on
March 7. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks gained for the
first day this week after a rally in U.S. equities and a
government report that showed Japanese machinery orders rose in
January by more than economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
forecast, supporting the global economic recovery outlook.  “There’s less pressure on the oil front which is giving
Asian markets temporary relief,” said Lam Chee Mun, a  fund
manager  in  Kuala Lumpur  at TA Investment Management Bhd., which
oversees about $235 million of assets. “The growth outlook in
the major economies is still fragile but improving.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.1 percent to 3.0309 per dollar
as of 4:06 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has appreciated 1.1 percent this year
and reached 3.0240 on Feb. 21, the strongest since October 1997.  The dollar-ringgit rate has “potential downside bias as
risk-averse sentiment subsided,” according to a research note
to clients released today by Kuala Lumpur-based AmBank Bhd.
“Early gains in Asian equities signal investors’ renewed
interest in higher-yielding assets, thus benefitting regional
currencies, including the ringgit.”  Bond Auction  A government report tomorrow will show Malaysian factory
output rose 1.2 percent in January from a year earlier, compared
with a 4.2 percent gain in December, according to the median
estimate of 17 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. That would
be the smallest gain in 14 months.    Bank Negara Malaysia  will keep its overnight rate at 2.75
percent when it meets on March 11, according to 15 of 19
economists in a separate Bloomberg poll. Four predicted an
increase to 3 percent. Policy makers have not changed the rate
since July.  Five-year bond yields were little changed before the
government conducts two debt auctions later this month. The
yield on the 3.835 percent note maturing in August 2015 held at
3.5 percent, the highest level since Feb. 9, according to Bursa
Malaysia.  The treasury will auction 4 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion)
of 2016 bonds on March 14. It’s also scheduled to sell Shariah-
compliant notes due in September 2014 later this month,
according to its sales calendar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
