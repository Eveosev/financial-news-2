  Chase Utley ’s injured knee failed to
respond to a cortisone shot, leading the  Philadelphia Phillies 
to seek additional opinions on treatment for the All-Star second
baseman.  Utley, who hasn’t played during spring training, has a
history of mild patellar tendinitis and chondromalacia in his
knee that returned during offseason workouts, the Phillies’ team
physician, Michael Ciccotti, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “When he reported to spring training this year, his knee
was treated as it had been in the past, however his symptoms
continued,” Ciccotti said. “His chondromalacia symptoms
persisted in spite of focused non-operative care, including a
cortisone injection.”  An MRI of the cartilage confirmed the initial diagnosis,”
the doctor added. He said Utley will continue to receive non-
operative treatment while additional opinions are sought.  Chondromalacia, commonly known as “runner’s knee,” is a
general term indicating damage to the cartilage under the
kneecap, according to the  Mayo Clinic ’s website.  Utley, 32, has been an All-Star each of the last five
seasons. He’s a career .293 hitter with 177 home runs and 650
runs batted in during his eight-year Major League Baseball
career, all with the Phillies.  Utley played in 115 games last season, missing 43 straight
contests after injuring his thumb. He also played through hip
pain during the 2008 season as the Phillies won the  World
Series , and had surgery during the offseason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
