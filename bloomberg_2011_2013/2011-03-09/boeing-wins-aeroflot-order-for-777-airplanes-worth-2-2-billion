  Boeing Co. (BA)  won a contract from OAO
Aeroflot to deliver eight 777 airliners that the Russian carrier
will use to expand its fleet before the 2014 Winter Olympics in
the Black Sea resort town of Sochi.  Aeroflot agreed to buy six Boeing 777-300ERs and two Boeing
777-200ERs, the companies said in a joint statement today during
Vice President Joseph Biden’s visit to Moscow, without giving
financial terms of the contract. The order is worth about $2.2
billion, based on the catalog prices listed on Boeing’s website.  Carriers in the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose
grouping of Russia and 10 other former Soviet republics will
probably spend $90 billion buying 960 new passenger aircraft
over the next 20 years as they upgrade and expand their aging
fleets, Chicago-based Boeing said in October.  “These  Boeing 777  airplanes will strengthen our network
strategy, particularly the international growth opportunities we
expect from our joint businesses with SkyTeam partners when
servicing the 2014 Sochi  Olympic Games  and the 2018 FIFA  World
Cup ,” Aeroflot Chief Executive Officer Vitaly Savelyev said in
the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
