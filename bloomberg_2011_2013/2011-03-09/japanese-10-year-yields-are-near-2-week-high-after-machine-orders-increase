Japan’s 10-year yields were less
than two basis points from a two-week high after a report showed
machine orders in January rose more than economists forecast.  Bond futures dropped for a second day as local stocks
gained after crude-oil prices retreated from the most in 29
months. Demand for debt waned on expectations investors will
pare holdings to prepare for tomorrow’s sale of five-year notes.  “Economic sentiment isn’t that bad, while expectations may
not be rising about the outlook,” said  Ayako Sera , a strategist
in Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which manages about
$326 billion in investments. “That’s why a rise in yields has
been rather limited compared with stock gains.”  The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due March 2021 rose half
a basis point to 1.3 percent as of the 11:05 a.m. break in Tokyo
at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The price fell 0.044 yen to 100.000 yen.  Ten-year yields reached 1.315 percent on March 4, the
highest since Feb. 18. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery declined 0.10 to
139.49 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 1 percent. Crude oil for
April delivery dropped 42 cents to settle at $105.02 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday.  Machine Orders  Machine orders gained 4.2 percent in January from the
previous month when they rose 1.7 percent, the Cabinet Office
reported today in Tokyo. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 3 percent increase.  The Ministry of Finance will sell 2.4 trillion yen ($29
billion) of five-year notes tomorrow. The prior five-year sale
on Feb. 16 drew bids worth 3.56 times the amount on offer,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.97 at the January sale.  Primary dealers, which are required to bid at government
debt sales, often reduce holdings before an auction in case
prices drop before they can pass on the new bonds to investors.  Five-year yields rose 1.5 basis points to 0.555 percent,
making it likely that the coupon on tomorrow’s new notes will be
unchanged from the current benchmark.  “There’s a greater expectation for the five-year auction
to be sold at a 0.6 percent level,” said Makoto Kuroda, a
Tokyo-based strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “The market is
expected to adjust to the auction.”  The government nominated Sayuri Shirai, an economics
professor, to the Bank of Japan’s policy board, according to a
statement released yesterday in Tokyo.  If approved by a full parliament, Shirai, a 48-year-old
economist who has worked at the  International Monetary Fund  and
published work on  Europe ’s debt woes, would replace  Miyako Suda ,
the bank’s biggest opponent of monetary easing.  “We don’t know much about her views on monetary policy, so
all we can say for now is Suda’s departure may make the board
less hawkish,” said  Chotaro Morita , chief strategist at
Barclays Capital Japan Ltd. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
