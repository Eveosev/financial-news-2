The smallest Czech ruling-coalition
party, Public Affairs, wants more government negotiations on the
planned overhaul of the pension system, a senior party official
said today.  Transportation Minister Vit Barta, a member of Public
Affairs’ executive council, told reporters in  Prague  he didn’t
want to set any deadline for completing the talks on the pension
revamp. The leaders of the three Cabinet parties will meet to
debate how to proceed with pension changes tomorrow, Barta said.  Prime Minister Petr Necas said on March 2 that leaders of
the ruling parties had reached an agreement on a pension revamp
that will strengthen private saving for retirement. Necas called
the pension overhaul the key task for his government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
