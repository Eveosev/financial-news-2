  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s
biggest company by market value, plans to spend $100 million a
day for the next half decade on capital projects such as new  oil
wells  and natural-gas plants.  Exxon has budgeted $34 billion for capital projects this
year, a 5.6 percent increase from 2010, Chief Executive Officer
Rex Tillerson said today at an analyst meeting in  New York . The
budget will range from $33 billion to $37 billion through 2015,
according to a slide presentation prepared for the meeting.  Exxon expects to boost oil and gas production by 3 percent
to 4 percent this year, the company said. Eleven new projects
are scheduled to begin pumping oil or gas between now and 2013.  Exxon is spending more as the company expands its search
for untapped oil and gas fields, and upgrades refining and
chemical plants in  Asia  to supply the world’s fastest-growing
energy markets. Production rose 13 percent last year, the
largest annual increase since Exxon’s 1999 acquisition of Mobil
Corp.  Oil prices reached a 29-month high this week amid unrest
in the Middle East.  “We are executing a large inventory of high-quality
projects,” Tillerson said today. “Actual spending in a given
year will vary depending on the pace and the progress of each
project.”  About 80 percent of production from new wells between now
and 2016 will consist of crude oil, the company said. Exxon’s
exploration prospects range from  Madagascar  to  Greenland  to  Vietnam .  Outpacing Mexico’s Reserves  The company replaced 209 percent of the oil and gas pumped
from its wells last year, partly through the $34.9 billion
acquisition of  Fort Worth , Texas-based XTO Energy Inc. Exxon had
proved reserves equivalent to 24.8 billion barrels at the end of
December, which exceeded the crude reserves of nations such as
Mexico or Algeria.  Exxon shares fell 84 cents to $83.76 at 9:57 a.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Exxon, which traces its roots to the 1880s and John D.
Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust, earned $15.50 in profit on
each barrel of crude it produced in 2010, Tillerson said today
in remarks to a gathering of analysts at the New York Stock
Exchange.  Exxon is awaiting U.S. regulatory approval to drill two
wells at its deep-water Hadrian discovery in the  Gulf of Mexico ,
the company said. Work on Hadrian was interrupted after the
fatal explosion at BP Plc’s Macondo well in April prompted the
government to halt all exploration drilling in waters deeper
than 500 feet (152 meters).  To contact the reporter on this story:
