The sale of the environmental unit
of Connaught Plc, a U.K. social-housing maintenance company that
collapsed in September, was completed yesterday, saving 2,700
jobs, the London-based Times reported.  A group led by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Alchemy
Partners LLP, a private-equity company, bought the business,
which provides landscaping and forestry services, including
trimming trees along railway lines, the newspaper said.  The unit, which has resumed its old name, Fountains, was
listed on  London ’s Alternative Investment Market until Connaught
acquired it in 2009; it’s been run as a going concern by  KPMG ,
Connaught’s administrator, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
