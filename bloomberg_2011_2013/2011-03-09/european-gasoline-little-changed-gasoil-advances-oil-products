European gasoline was little changed
in northwest  Europe  as  Total SA (FP)  bought on the barge market for
at least a third day.  The motor fuel’s premium to  Brent crude , or crack spread,
narrowed for a third day. Gasoil futures advanced on London’s
ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Light Products  Eurobob gasoline for immediate loading in northwest Europe
traded from $971 to $975 a metric ton, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That
compares with trades yesterday from $967 to $986 for the grade,
to which ethanol is added before being sold to motorists. Barge
deals are usually for about 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  The front-month gasoline crack narrowed to $6.97 a barrel
as of 2:14 p.m.  London  time, compared with $7.35 yesterday,
according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd. data on Bloomberg.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for March delivery added $7.25, or 0.8 percent, to
$957 a ton on the ICE exchange. The front-month contract expires
tomorrow. The more-actively traded April contract was at
$960.50.  The fuel’s crack spread was at $14.17 a barrel, compared
with $14.52 at 16:30 p.m. yesterday.  Refineries  Exxon Mobil Corp. started a flexicoker at its Rotterdam
refinery after a fault late yesterday and is in the process of
starting associated units, Ellen Ehman, a company spokeswoman,
said today by telephone. The refinery can process 182,000
barrels of crude oil a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
