A Tunisian court ruled to dissolve
the country’s former ruling party and liquidate its assets, the
state-run Tunis Afrique Presse news agency reported, without
saying how it got the information.  The party’s dissolution “is an expected and important
measure,” Qais Said, a professor of constitutional law at El
Manar University in Tunis, said by telephone today. “However,
it’s not enough. All secret RCD files should be released and
opened to the public,” he said, referring to the party’s French
acronym.  Tunisia’s interim President Fouad Mebazaa appointed a
Cabinet on March 7 as the Interior Ministry dissolved its state
security branch, meeting protesters’ demands.  Tunisia’s caretaker government has been trying to bring
stability to the North African country, where weeks of protests
over high food prices, unemployment and political repression
forced former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali out of power on
Jan. 14 and inspired uprisings across the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
