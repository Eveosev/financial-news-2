The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1.5 basis points to 95.5
basis points as of 9:19 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG. It’s on track to fall for the fifth straight day to the
lowest since Nov. 29, prices from data provider CMA show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 1 basis point to 105.5 as of
8:18 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole  CIB prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 0.5 basis point to
106 basis points as of 11:18 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit
Agricole. That’s its lowest since Feb. 21, CMA price show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
