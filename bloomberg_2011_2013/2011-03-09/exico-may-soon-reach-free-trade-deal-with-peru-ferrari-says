  Mexico ’s government is close to
reaching a free-trade agreement with  Peru  that would more than
double the country’s exports to the South American nation,
Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari said.  Mexico currently exports $974 million a year to Peru, which
represents 0.3 percent of Mexican exports and accounts for 3.4
percent of Peru’s imports, according to a document Ferrari
presented at Congress today.  Mexican exports to Peru would increase to $2.7 billion
under a free-trade agreement, the document said.  Mexico’s Senate must ratify trade agreements reached by the
government, according to Mexican law.  To contact the reporters on this story:
