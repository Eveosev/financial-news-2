Asian stocks advanced for the first
day this week after oil prices retreated and Japanese machinery
orders rose more than expected in January.    Air China Ltd. (753)  and Eva Airways Corp. rose at least 1
percent as crude oil futures dropped for a second day. Yokogawa
Electric Corp., a maker of electronic measuring tools, surged
5.6 percent in Tokyo after Mizuho Securities Co. boosted the
stock’s rating. BHP Billiton Ltd., Australia’s biggest oil
producer and the world largest mining company, dropped 1.3
percent in Sydney as oil and copper futures fell.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2 percent to 138.23 as
of 7:21 p.m. in Tokyo, with about seven shares advancing for
every five that fell. The gauge climbed 1.9 percent last week as
better-than-estimated economic data from  South Korea  to the U.S.
bolstered confidence in a global recovery, overcoming concern
that Middle East unrest will boost  oil prices  and slow growth.  “Investors are likely focusing more on the economic
recovery after the pause in the rally in crude-oil prices, even
if uncertainty in the oil market remains,” said Naoki Fujiwara,
who helps oversee $6 billion in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset
Management Co.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.6 percent. The
nation’s machinery orders increased 4.2 percent in January from
the previous month, signaling that companies will boost spending
as economic recoveries abroad strengthen. That was higher than
the median forecast of a 3 percent gain by 28 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Asia-Pacific Indexes    Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index increased 0.4 percent, while  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index climbed less than 0.1 percent.
South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 0.3 percent.  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.8 percent as home-loan approvals
declined in January by the most in a year.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index increased 0.9 percent yesterday in  New
York  as Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender, led banks to
the biggest rally among the  S&P 500 ’s 24 industry groups.  Airlines rebounded after oil dropped for a second day in
New York as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries considered talks about increasing production because
violence is disrupting supplies from  Libya . Crude for April
delivery decreased as much as 0.8 percent to $104.21 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Airlines Gain  Air China, the world’s biggest airline by market value,
gained 1.1 percent to HK$7.46 in Hong Kong. Korean Air Lines Co.
gained 1 percent to 62,700 won in  Seoul . Eva Airways Corp.
jumped 5.9 percent to NT$26.25 in Taipei.    Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  climbed 4.5 percent to
HK$18.94 in Hong Kong after saying full-year net income tripled
to HK$14 billion ($1.8 billion) as passenger numbers increased
and cargo volumes surged.  “Crude oil futures have stopped rising for the moment and
that’s eased uncertainty somewhat,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an
equities manager at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. in Tokyo.
“The global economy is recovering and companies are showing
better earnings.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has almost doubled in the past
two years. The gauge has risen 96 percent since March 9, 2009,
when it sank to an eight-year low following the bankruptcy
filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Yokogawa Electric surged 5.6 percent to 665 yen, the most
on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , after Mizuho Securities raised the stock to
“outperform” from “underperform.” Bridgestone Corp., the
world’s biggest tiremaker, increased 3.1 percent to 1,773 yen
after Citigroup Inc. boosted its share-price estimate to 2,260
yen from 1,970 yen.  BHP, Newcrest Drop  Nintendo Co., the world’s largest maker of video-game
consoles, jumped 3.7 percent to 23,800 yen after saying it sold
more than 1.08 million new Pokemon games after one day.  A gauge of raw-material producers declined the most among
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s 10 industry groups, seven of which
advanced.  BHP Billiton slid 1.3 percent to A$46 in Sydney. Rio Tinto
Group, the world’s No. 3 mining company, declined 1.8 percent to
A$82.38. Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Australia’s second-largest oil
producer, dropped 1.1 percent to A$42.24. Inpex Corp., Japan’s
biggest oil explorer, lost 1.2 percent to 578,000 yen.    Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s largest gold producer,
dropped 2.6 percent to A$38.30 in Sydney as demand for bullion
as a safe haven decreased. Real Gold Mining Ltd. slipped 1.6
percent to HK$12.46 in Hong Kong.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5.1 percent by the S&P
500 and 2.2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.9 times estimated earnings on
average as of the last close, compared with 13.7 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
