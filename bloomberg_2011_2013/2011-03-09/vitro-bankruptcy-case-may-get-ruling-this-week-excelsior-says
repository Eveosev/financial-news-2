A court-appointed official will
submit a report today on whether Vitro SAB, the Mexican
glassmaker that defaulted on debt in 2009, qualifies for
bankruptcy proceedings, Dario Celis, a columnist with Excelsior
newspaper, reported.  Federal District Judge Francisco Flores, who presides over
the bankruptcy case, may rule on the qualification by March 11
and make the decision known to the involved parties on March 14,
Celis reported, without saying where he got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Thomas Black  in Monterrey at
