The  Houston Ship Channel  had 15
deep-draft vessels including tankers waiting to enter after
pilots halted operations yesterday because fog limited
visibility on the approach to the largest U.S. petroleum port,
according to the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service.  Eight ships in Houston were waiting to leave as of 5:54
a.m. this morning, Albert Hernandez, a watch supervisor with the
service, said in a telephone interview from Houston. Pilots
suspended transits in both directions at 4 p.m. yesterday, he
said.  As of 6 a.m., 15 Houston-bound vessels were waiting to
enter the channel and eight vessels in Houston were waiting to
leave, he said.  An advisory for dense fog limiting visibility to about a
quarter of a mile (0.4 kilometer) is in effect until 9 a.m.
local time today, the U.S. National Weather Service said in a
 statement  issued at 3:28 a.m. today.  Tankers use the channel connecting the  Gulf of Mexico  to
the Port of Houston to deliver crude oil to refineries around
Houston,  Texas City  and Baytown. A prolonged halt may force
refiners to reduce operating rates, possibly increasing prices
for refined products as companies turn to spot markets for oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Jim Polson  in New York at
