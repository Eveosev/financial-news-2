Ghana ’s inflation rate rose in
February for the second consecutive month as a 30 percent jump
in gasoline costs at the beginning of the year pushed up
transportation fees.  Inflation accelerated to 9.2 percent from 9.1 percent in
January,  Grace Bediako , head of the Ghana Statistical Service,
told reporters today in the capital, Accra.  “With most of the upward pressure on inflation arising
from the 30 percent fuel-price increase in the new year,
February inflation should still be up,” Razia Khan, head of
Africa research at Standard Chartered Bank Plc in  London , said
in an e-mailed note yesterday.  The pick-up in inflation is beginning to put pressure on
the central bank to raise  interest rates , Lisa Lewin, head of
sub-Saharan Africa analysis at Business Monitor International,
said in an e-mailed note yesterday. The acceleration may not be
enough yet to push the Bank of Ghana to tighten monetary policy,
she said.  “The rate at which inflation increases in February and
March will however be the crucial determinants,” Lewin said.  The inflation rate had fallen from a five-year high of 20.7
percent in June 2009, enabling the central bank to cut its key
interest rate by 4.5 percentage points last year. The last
reduction in July took the rate to 13.5 percent from 15 percent.  The National Petroleum Authority increased gasoline prices
on Jan. 4 following a rally in global  oil prices .  “The impact of the increase in the fuel price may result
in a continuous rise in inflation in the first quarter,”
Bediako said in an interview on Jan. 26.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
