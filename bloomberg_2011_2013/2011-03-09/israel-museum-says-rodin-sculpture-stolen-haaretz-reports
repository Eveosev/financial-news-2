Auguste Rodin’s “Naked Balzac with
Folded Arms” was stolen from the Israel Museum during recent
renovations and a police report was filed three months ago, the
daily Haaretz reported today, citing unnamed museum management.  Israel police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  was checking the
report and an official in the museum management, who spoke
anonymously because they weren’t authorized to speak to the
press on the matter, confirmed the theft.    To contact the reporter on this story:
