  Restaurant Group Plc (RTN) , the U.K. owner
of the Frankie and Benny’s chain, rose the most since August
2009 after Chief Executive Officer Andrew Page said the company
is confident of meeting analysts’ full-year estimates.  “Our intention is to meet market forecasts, we’ve had a
very good start to the year,” Page said by phone today. “We
are happy with where the analysts have their consensus.”  Restaurant Group climbed 9.4 percent. Page said estimates
for pretax profit centred at about 60 million pounds ($96.9
million) for the 2011 fiscal year. The median of 15 analysts’
estimate in a Bloomberg survey is for profit on that basis of
60.9 million pounds. Pretax profit for the 53 weeks ended Jan. 2
was 56.5 million pounds, the London-based company said today.  Restaurant Group, which also owns the Garfunkel’s and
Chiquito chains, will create as many as 700 jobs this year by
opening about 25 outlets nationwide, Page said. The company
added 24 sites and closed two last year, giving it a total of
389 eateries. Sales at sites open for at least a year increased
3 percent in the nine weeks to March 6, after falling 1 percent
last year, the company said.  “Current trading is better than expected,” John Beaumont,
an analyst with Matrix Corporate Capital LLP, said in an e-
mailed note to investors. “We view Restaurant Group as a
quality company with decent brands, well-managed and with non-
high street exposure it avoids the fiercest competition.”
Beaumont has an “add” recommendation on the stock.  Wedding Boost  Restaurant Group, which has 5 percent of its outlets in
central London, sees a potential boost in sales from the wedding
of  Prince William  and  Kate Middleton  on April 29 when many
visitors are expected to travel to the capital for the ceremony.  “We are very excited by the wedding, and we are already
organizing specials at our pubs,” Page said. “There is a feel-
good factor, which I hope will make a positive difference to our
sales.”  Full-year net income was 40.1 million pounds, or 20.1 pence
a share, compared with 37.3 million pounds, or 18.8 pence, in
the 52 weeks ended Dec. 27, 2009. Sales rose 7 percent to 465.7
million pounds.  Restaurant Group advanced 26.3 pence, or 9.4 percent, to
306.1 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the most since
Aug. 28, 2009. At that closing price the company had a market
value of 610.8 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
