The U.K. may boost subsidies for
geothermal energy, predicting that an industry that now has a
single well nationwide can supply as much as 10 percent of
consumer electricity needs.  Government officials have started reviewing aid programs
for renewable energy plants, including those whose turbines draw
heat from at least 2 miles below the Earth’s surface, said Greg Barker, the U.K. energy and climate change minister.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s administration, seeking 200
billion ($325 billion) in investment to replace aged power
stations in the next decade, also has pledged to reduce fossil
fuels emissions by a third and to double the portion of
electricity coming from renewable sources by 2020. That’s
forcing officials to look beyond the wind, nuclear power and
natural gas industries for low-emissions energy.  “Deep geothermal energy is an exciting renewable energy
source with considerable unexploited potential,” Barker said in
an e-mailed response to questions made to his office.    GDF Suez (GSZ)  operates the U.K.’s only deep geothermal well,
providing heat to buildings in Southampton along the south
coast. EGS Energy Ltd. and Geothermal Engineering Ltd. have won
planning approval for generation projects in the region. Further
incentives may be needed to draw bigger investors such as  Israel ’s  Ormat Industries (ORMT)  Inc.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Enel Green
Power SpA (EGPW) , which are tapping bigger geothermal projects in the
U.S.,  Asia  and  Europe , executives said.  ‘Non-Existent’  “The geothermal industry in the U.K. is non-existent at
the moment,” said Padraig Hanly, chief executive GT Energy
Ltd., an Irish project developer. “There is no sufficient
financial support mechanism in place to drive it forward.”  U.K. government officials are currently examining support
levels for small and large-scale clean-energy generation under
its feed-in-tariff and Renewable Obligation Certificate systems.
The tariffs guarantee above-market prices for power from clean
and low-carbon sources. The ROCs, as they’re known, must be
bought by utilities that don’t generate enough renewable energy.  The government also is considering how to stimulate
renewable-heat projects, which moderate temperatures in
buildings. It may support geothermal technologies as part of
that effort.  The Department of Energy and Climate Change is due to
announce incentives for renewable heat next month. The first
decisions from the review of subsidies under the feed-in-tariff
may come by July, with new prices coming into force in April
2012 under a program announced Feb. 7. For subsidies under the
ROC system, results may be published in the second half of the
year, with new rates active from April 2013.  ‘Hotspot’  Barker said the southwest of the U.K. including Devon and
Cornwall is a “hotspot” for geothermal energy, with the
potential to supply 2 percent of the nation’s electricity. His
department estimates the technology eventually could generate 10
percent of power nationally. Hanly of GT Energy says it could
supply 30 percent of heating needs.  Geothermal wells, which bore 2 miles or more into pools
underground of steam or hot water as much as 300 degrees Celsius
(572 degrees Fahrenheit), provide around-the-clock power. The
supply, once tapped, is more reliable than intermittent wind and
solar energy. Heat pumps work at more moderate temperatures
closer to the surface to heat and cool buildings.  Bigger Markets  Worldwide, geothermal wells with a capacity to produce
about 10.8 gigawatts of power are operating, and 13.2 gigawatts
more are planned, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates. The
largest development pipelines are in the most developed markets,
which are the U.S., the  Philippines  and  Indonesia .  Britain has the expertise to drill wells, completing 191
for oil and gas companies last year according to the lobby group
Oil & Gas U.K. Ltd. To date, geothermal developers have shied
away from Britain because of uncertainty about planning rules
and government incentives, said Nomura Code Securities Ltd., a
London-based investment bank considering funds for the industry.  “These issues have been a key concern for investors when
discussing potential financing,” said Ken Rumph, equity
research analyst at Nomura.  Developers want higher subsidies and insulation from
drilling risks before they pour money into geothermal projects.
Hanly said he’s received indications from Barker, the government
minister, that officials may be willing to increase the number
of ROCs that can be earned by geothermal energy projects with
the capacity to generate more than 5 megawatts.  More ROCs  “We spoke with Minister Greg Barker, and in my opinion he
might give us four ROCs,” which is double the current level,
Hanly said. “What could be a way forward is to put a cap on the
amount of capacity deployed to decrease financial exposure to
the Department of Energy and Climate Change.”  Doubling the subsidy level through ROCs would result in
geothermal electricity earning about 195 pounds a megawatt-hour,
up from the current 98 pounds. Tidal energy developers also are
pushing for an increase in the number of ROCs they earn to five
from two.  The energy department obtained 200 million pounds for
funding low-carbon technologies from the Treasury in October. It
indicated 60 million pounds will be spent on offshore wind port
development, leaving 140 million pounds that has yet to be
allocated.  In the past two years, the government has invested 5
million pounds in the industry. It slashed grant funding from
its Deep Geothermal Challenge Fund to 1.1 million pounds from 2
million pounds for 2010. Marine energy by comparison received
54.6 million pounds in the past 18 months. A single geothermal
well costs about 10 million pounds, according to Ryan Law, chief
executive of Geothermal Engineering.    Daldrup & Soehne AG (4DS) , a German drilling company, is seeking
at least 300 euros ($420) a megawatt-hour to prospect for
geothermal electricity in Britain.  “If there is a friendly setting of industrial partners and
of the government we will be keen to invest in the U.K.,” said
Dietmar Brockhaus, a spokesman from Daldrup.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
