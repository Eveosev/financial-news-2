Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in the Americas, tumbled to a four-month low on concern the sale
of as much as $1.38 billion of convertible bonds will boost the
supply of the shares and may portend further dilution.  Cemex fell 2.7 percent to 10.39 pesos at 4 p.m. New York
time, the lowest closing price since Oct. 25, 2010.  The Monterrey, Mexico-based company said late yesterday
that it will offer $600 million of notes that mature in 2016 and
an equal amount due in 2018, which are convertible to U.S.
shares. The financial institutions managing the sales will have
over-allotment options to purchase $90 million in notes for each
issue. The convertible bond sale is stoking concern that the
company may further increase the share supply, said Jose Itzamna Espitia Hernandez, an analyst with IXE Grupo Financero SAB.  “They could do another small capital increase,” he said
in a telephone interview from  Mexico  City. “That could be
creating noise in the share price.”  Shareholders on Feb. 24 authorized Cemex to create 200
million American depositary receipts, which were worth $1.78
billion at yesterday’s closing price.  The company had no further comment about the possibility of
creating more shares to reach the total authorized, Jorge Perez,
a Cemex spokesman, said in a telephone interview today.  Cemex has sold assets and shares in the past three years to
reduce debt after Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Zambrano bought companies for more than two decades, including
the $14.2 billion acquisition of Rinker Group in 2007.  The company’s fourth-quarter loss widened to $574 million,
or 57 cents per American depositary receipt, from a loss of $209
million a year earlier.  “Cemex is one of the few companies in Mexico that
continues to not generate value, and I’m talking about profit
for shareholders,” said Jorge Lagunas, who manages about $200
million at Mexico City-based Grupo Financiero Interacciones SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
