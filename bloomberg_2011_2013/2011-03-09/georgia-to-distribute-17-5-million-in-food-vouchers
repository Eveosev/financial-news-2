The Georgian government will
distribute 30 million lari ($17.5) in one-time food vouchers to
1 million families after already handing out free electricity
coupons.  Families that have already received 20-lari energy vouchers
will be able to pick up the grocery tickets beginning tomorrow
at Liberty Bank branches, Health, Labor and Social Affairs
Minister Andria Urushadze told reporters in Tbilisi today.  The government said the voucher programs are meant to stem
inflation in the former Soviet republic, after annual consumer-
price growth rose to 12.3 percent in January. The distribution
would have the opposite effect, said Vladimer Papava, an
economist at the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and
International Studies.  “The electricity and grocery vouchers will not make
people’s lives easier and only make market food prices rise,”
said Papava. “The best option would be for the government to
have a good clear plan, which is nonexistent.”  The handout would be financed through the state budget,
which probably ended last year with a 1.1 billion-lari deficit,
according to estimates by the  International Monetary Fund . Its
foreign debt rose to $3.9 billion by Dec. 31, the government
said on Jan. 12.  In January, the IMF called on  Georgia  to reduce its  budget
deficit  and foreign debt in order to improve investor confidence
and cut its dependence on international aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
