Yields on Israeli 10-year  government
bonds  held close to the highest level in more than a year on
bets a report next week will show inflation accelerated in
February. The shekel strengthened for a third day.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit due January 2020 rose,
pushing the yield down 2 basis points to 5.19 percent at the
4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The yield reached 5.22 percent on
March 7, the highest since December 2009. The shekel
strengthened 0.4 percent to 3.5640 per dollar as of 4:35 p.m.  “Market volume is low as investors hold positions ahead of
the consumer price index report next week and expectations of
faster interest rate increases,” Sagie Poznerson, a bond trader
at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by telephone.
“The geopolitical situation is also weighing on  Israel ’s risk
premium keeping yields at high levels.”  One-year-forward and medium-term inflation expectations are
above the government’s 1 percent to 3 percent target range, the
Bank of Israel said in the minutes of its last rate decision
meeting. Governor  Stanley Fischer  raised the benchmark lending
rate for March by a quarter percentage point, after annual
inflation increased to 3.6 percent. The Jerusalem-based Central
Bureau of Statistics will release February prices March 15.  Inflation expectations, as derived from the  bond market ,
have increased since the last price report on Feb. 15, with the
spread between inflation-linked bonds due October 2014 and
fixed-rate notes of similar maturity widening 24 basis points to
344.43, which implies expected inflation of about 3.4 percent.  Fischer may raise the rate by 50 basis points in a single
decision after two consecutive rate increases of 25 basis points
failed to curb inflation expectations,  David Lubin , chief
emerging-markets economist at Citigroup Inc said in an e-mailed
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
