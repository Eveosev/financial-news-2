  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  said it hired Kyle McSlarrow, head of a cable-TV trade association, to run its
public policy and business operations in  Washington .  McSlarrow will be in charge of policy, legislative and
regulatory government affairs activities, starting next month,
the biggest U.S. cable carrier said today in a statement.
McSlarrow has been the head of the Washington-based  National
Cable & Telecommunications Association  since March 2005.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, won government approval to
buy 51 percent of media company NBC Universal Inc. in January
and must adhere to Federal Communications Commission rules,
including regulations about the distribution of NBC content.  Before NCTA, McSlarrow was deputy secretary of the U.S.
Department of Energy. He was national chairman for former Vice
President Dan Quayleâ€™s 2000 presidential campaign and chief of
staff for former Georgia Republican Senator Paul Coverdell.  Comcast fell 25 cents to $25.31 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained 15 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
