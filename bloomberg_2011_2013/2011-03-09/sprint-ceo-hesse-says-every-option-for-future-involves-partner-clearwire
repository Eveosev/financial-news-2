Chief Executive Officer Dan Hesse
said  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  remains committed to  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) 
and that “every option” for Sprint’s future involves the
wholesaler and fourth-generation WiMax technology.  Hesse said he’d like to see Overland Park, Kansas-based
Sprint do more network sharing with Clearwire, which sells
capacity from its own network to Sprint and other carriers. He
spoke today at the Deutsche Bank AG Media & Telecom Conference
in Palm Beach, Florida. Clearwire is 54 percent owned by Sprint.    Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  has held talks to sell its T-Mobile USA
unit to Sprint in exchange for a major stake in the combined
entity, according to people with knowledge of the discussions,
as Bloomberg reported yesterday.  Deutsche Telekom and Sprint haven’t been able to agree on a
valuation for  T-Mobile USA , the fourth-largest U.S. wireless
carrier, the people said. Hesse declined to comment on
speculation about any such transactions.  Sprint may consider a “spectrum hosting” agreement with
Kirkland, Washington-based Clearwire, Hesse said. Clearwire said
in November it was delaying introduction of a Clear-branded
phone and paring 15 percent of its workforce to save as much as
$400 million.  Sprint was unchanged at $4.70 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Clearwire rose 19 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $5.38 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
