Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said she will set a date for parliamentary elections after
completing accession negotiations with the European Union.  “The ruling party and I are not afraid of the elections,
but we should first conclude our historic mission” of joining
the EU, Kosor said on state radio today.  Thousands of people have protested in the last two weeks
in the capital city Zagreb and elsewhere demanding the
government step down over the economic crisis and early
elections be held. Early elections are also supported by the
opposition, which has said it is not involved in organizing the
protests. General elections must be held by the end of the year.    Croatia  wants to conclude talks by June and be the second
former Yugoslav republic to join the EU in 2012. The country is
trying to crawl out of a recession as it rebuilds its economy,
boosts trade and restores links with Balkan neighbors that were
torn apart during the 1990s breakup of  Yugoslavia .  To complete the membership talks, Croatia still has to
complete reforms in two chapters, or policy areas, including the
judiciary and fundamental rights and competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
