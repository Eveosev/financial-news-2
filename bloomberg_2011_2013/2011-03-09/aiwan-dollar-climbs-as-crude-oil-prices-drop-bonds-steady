  Taiwan ’s dollar advanced as  oil
prices  retreated for a second day, easing concern high fuel
costs will derail the global economic recovery.  Crude for April delivery slipped 0.1 percent to $104.87 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries considered talks
to step up production. The government’s 10-year bonds gained as
inflation concerns receded.  “A decline in oil has helped the currency,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based bond trader at Polaris Securities Co.
“But investors’ concern about inflation caused by higher oil
prices will continue to weigh on” bonds, she added.  Taiwan’s dollar closed 0.1 percent stronger at NT$29.395
against the greenback, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It earlier
touched 29.31, matching the strongest level since Feb. 18.  The cost of crude in  New York  has risen 15 percent this
year as an uprising in Libya,  Africa ’s third-largest oil
producer, disrupted supplies. Taiwan’s consumer prices increased
1.33 percent from a year earlier in February, the biggest gain
in three months, according to data released this week.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.375 percent bond due March 2021
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.42 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. It reached 1.44 percent
on March 1, the highest level for a benchmark 10-year note since
Feb. 9. The government plans to auction NT$40 billion ($1.4
billion) of similar-maturity notes on March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
