  Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef, the
country’s top tourist attraction, may take decades to recover
from the damage caused by Cyclone Yasi, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing research by the area’s authorities.  Divers who surveyed 36 reefs in a 300-kilometer stretch
which bore the full brunt of the cyclone said there was hardly a
coral left alive; the cyclone struck at a time when the reef was
suffering from pollution and fresh water generated by the
Queensland floods, the newspaper said.  Over 2 million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each
year, providing more than $2 billion in revenue, according to
the WSJ.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
