  XL Group Plc (XL) , the insurer and
reinsurer, said losses from the Christchurch,  New Zealand ,
earthquake last month may be as high as $85 million.  The cost will probably be at least $70 million, most of 
which is tied to XLâ€™s reinsurance business, the Dublin-based
company said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
