  Thailand ’s baht maintained the day’s
advance after the central bank boosted borrowing costs, a
decision expected by most economists.  The Bank of Thailand increased the one-day bond repurchase
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.5 percent, as
predicted by 17 of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Three
forecast no change.  The baht rose 0.1 percent to 30.34 against the dollar as of
2:34 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
