  South Korea  plans to tighten
supervision of savings banks after the government was forced to
suspend eight lenders this year because they were unable to meet
depositors’ withdrawal demands.  The  Financial Services Commission  will stop setting
favorable lending limits for savings banks that have a capital-
adequacy ratio of more than 8 percent and a bad-loan ratio below
8 percent, the regulator said today in a report to the National
Assembly’s policy committee. It also aims to put limits on high-
risk assets and excessive expansion, the commission said.  Smaller banks in South Korea have seen loans for
construction projects turn sour amid a real estate market slump
following the global financial crisis. To secure funds to help
restructure ailing savings banks, the government plans to raise
the deposit insurance rate for the industry to 0.4 percent from
0.35 percent and create a restructuring account under the state-
run  deposit insurance  fund, the FSC said.  The regulator will also tighten controls on the owners and
major shareholders of savings banks to prevent abuse of funds
and improve disclosure rules to protect customers, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
