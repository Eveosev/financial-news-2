A jury has been selected to
determine criminal insider trading charges against  Raj Rajaratnam , the Galleon Group LLC co-founder on trial in federal
court in  Manhattan .  Twelve jurors and six alternates were chosen today from a
pool of about 300 summoned for jury duty in the case. Jury
selection in the trial was completed after U.S. District Judge  Richard Holwell  questioned potential jurors for more than a day.  Opening statements by prosecutors and lawyers for
Rajaratnam are set to begin today. Holwell told jurors yesterday
the trial may take 2 Â½ months.  Rajaratnam, 53, is the central figure in the largest
investigation of hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The
Sri Lankan-born money manager is accused of making $45 million
from confidential information leaked by corporate insiders and
hedge-fund traders. He may spend as long as 20 years in prison
if convicted of fraud.  Rajaratnam denies wrongdoing and has argued that investment
advisers routinely speak to company insiders as part of their
research on companies.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
