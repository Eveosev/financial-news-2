  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  agreed to
sell its 2.77 percent stake in Bank of Moscow to VTB Group,
Kommersant reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with
the matter.   The Credit Suisse shares, plus the 1.6 percent stake VTB
will buy from unidentified minority shareholders, will give VTB
control over Bank of Moscow, Kommersant said. VTB reached the
accord with Credit Suisse after a London court halted  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) â€™s planned sale of 3.88 percent of Bank of
Moscow to VTB, Kommersant said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
