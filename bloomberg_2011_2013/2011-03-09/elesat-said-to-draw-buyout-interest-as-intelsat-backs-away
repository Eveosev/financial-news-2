Telesat Holdings Inc., the Canadian
satellite company, may get joint offers from private equity
firms, while Intelsat SA is likely to drop out of the bidding,
said three people with knowledge of the matter.  KKR & Co.,  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and Providence Equity
Partners Inc. are bidding as a group, said one of the people,
who declined to be identified because the talks are private.
Offers are due in the next two weeks, the person said.  Carlyle
Group  is also planning to bid with partners, one person said.  Telesat, based in Ottawa, is co-owned by New York-based  Loral Space & Communications Inc. (LORL)  and Canada’s Public Sector
Pension Investment Board. The owners are seeking at least $6
billion, one of the people said. It’s unclear if there are other
bidders aside from the private equity firms.  Intelsat, the world’s second-largest fixed satellite
operator, is concerned that a purchase of Telesat, the fourth-
largest satellite company, would get hung up by regulators, the
person said. Intelsat is owned by BC Partners Ltd. and  Silver
Lake . The company had expressed initial interest in acquiring
Telesat for $6 billion to $7 billion and was one of the first
parties to contact the company, the people said.  Wendy Lewis, a spokeswoman for Loral, declined to comment.
Representatives from the private equity firms also declined to
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
