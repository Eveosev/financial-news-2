The European Union will face a
“cripplingly expensive” tab by 2040 unless it acts now to
tighten its emission-reduction targets, according to a
researcher at Climate Strategies.  The EU said it may cut  greenhouse gases  25 percent by 2020
compared with 1990, if it steps up energy-saving measures, the
European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said in a policy
 paper published  today in Strasbourg,  France . The document maps a
path for an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gases in 2050.  “They are right to be calling for deeper emissions cuts
sooner rather than later,” Emmanuel Guerin, project leader from
Climate Strategies, a Cambridge-based research group, said in an
e-mailed statement. “It would be deeply unfair to pass the buck
onto future generations, who by mid century will find reductions
a cripplingly expensive task.”    Europe ’s economy will shrink in the decade starting in 2040
“as money is poured into meeting 2050 targets,” Guerin said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
