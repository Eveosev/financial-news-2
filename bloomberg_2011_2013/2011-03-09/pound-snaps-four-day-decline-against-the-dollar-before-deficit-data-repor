The British pound strengthened
against the euro and the dollar after a report showed the
nation’s trade deficit narrowed more than economists forecast in
January as exports rose to a record.  Sterling reversed a four-day drop against its U.S.
counterpart. The deficit shrank to 7.06 billion pounds ($11.4
billion), the smallest in 11 months, from 9.69 billion pounds in
December, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in
London. That compares with the 8.5 billion-pound median forecast
of 17 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Exports rose 5.4
percent, while imports fell 4 percent.  “The trade figures have given the pound a boost on an
otherwise quiet day,” said Michael Derks, chief strategist at
FxPro Financial in London. “These are much healthier trade
figures. Exports were particularly strong.”  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to 85.84 pence per euro
as of 4:34 p.m. in London after reaching 85.65, the strongest
since March 3. Sterling gained 0.2 percent to $1.6194.  Bank of England policy makers will maintain the U.K.
interest rate at a record-low 0.5 percent tomorrow, according to
all 61 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. They will also
hold the size of the bank’s bond purchases at 200 billion
pounds, a separate survey showed.  U.K. shop prices rose at the fastest annual pace in two
years in February, another report showed today, spurring
speculation rates will be increased to counter inflation.  Retail Prices  Prices charged by retailers rose 2.7 percent from a year
earlier, up from 2.5 percent in January, as non-food stores
passed on the government’s increase in  sales tax , the  British
Retail Consortium  said today. The February reading is the
highest since November 2008.  “When you see the commodity-price rises that we have seen,
it’s no surprise that shop prices have gone up,” said Shant Movsesian, a foreign-exchange strategist at 4Cast Ltd. in
London. “Any talk of a rate hike is far too premature as yet,
but the markets are pricing it in and some people have bought
sterling.”  A gauge of full-time job placements reported by employment
consultancies rose to 62.7 from 58.2 in January, the highest in
10 months, a report by KPMG LLP and the Recruitment and
Employment Confederation showed today. Readings above 50
indicate an increase in hiring.  Interest Rate  Sterling has gained 3.7 percent against the dollar this
year amid speculation the U.K. central bank will need to raise
interest rates to curb rising prices. Soaring food and energy
costs helped to push inflation to 4 percent in January, the most
since November 2008.  Money-market investors are betting the  Bank of England  will
lift its benchmark rate by 25 basis points in June, and again in
October, according to forward rates on the sterling overnight
interbank average, or Sonia, compiled by Tullett Prebon Plc.
Predictions yesterday were for the first increase in July.  Short-sterling futures fell, pushing the implied yield on
the contract maturing in June 2011 up two basis point to 1.09
percent, as investors added to bets borrowing costs will rise.
The yield was 0.90 percent at the end of last year.  U.K. 10-year government bonds rose, pushing the yields down
one basis point to 3.66 percent. The 4.75 percent security,
maturing in March 2020, climbed 0.08, or 80 pence per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 108.27. Two-year note yields were little
changed at 1.39 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
