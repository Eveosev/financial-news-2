Mexico’s consumer prices rose less
than forecast last month as annual inflation slowed to the
lowest level in more than a year.  Prices increased 0.38 percent in February from January and
3.57 percent from a year earlier as costs fell for vegetables
and air transport, the central bank said on its website. Annual
inflation was the lowest since December 2009.  Economists had expected monthly inflation to increase 0.4
percent and forecast an annual rate of 3.6 percent, according to
the median estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Severe frosts in Mexico’s Sinaloa state last month damaged
corn crops, leading the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  to lower
its crop estimate for this year by 1 million to 3 million metric
tons, or as much as 12 percent.  The bad weather may not fuel inflation because farmers have
had time to replant and stockpiles are left over from last
year’s harvest, central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said in a
Feb. 17 interview.  The central bank said in a March 4 statement that the
balance of risks for inflation had deteriorated as unrest in
North Africa and the Middle East might affect capital inflows
and the currency, and as rising global costs of commodities may
also pressure consumer prices this year.  Still, policy makers expect inflation to remain within
their forecasts for 2011, the statement said.    Mexico ’s peso is the best performer against the dollar this
year among seven major Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. It rose 0.3 percent to 11.9682 at 10:34 a.m. New York
time.  Less Inflation  The central bank on Feb. 9 lowered its inflation forecast
for the first quarter and said annual inflation should be less
this year than it was in 2010. It expects inflation of 3 percent
to 4 percent in the first half of the year.  The bank last week extended its longest-ever interest rate
pause in voting to keep the overnight rate at 4.5 percent for a
17th straight meeting.  Economists surveyed Feb. 16-25 by the central bank raised
their year-end inflation forecast to 3.94 percent from 3.91
percent in January’s survey, while lowering their 2012 inflation
forecast to 3.79 percent from 3.86 percent.  Mexico’s central bank will keep borrowing costs unchanged
until January 2012, when it will raise the benchmark rate to
4.75 percent, according to a survey of economists released March
7 by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
