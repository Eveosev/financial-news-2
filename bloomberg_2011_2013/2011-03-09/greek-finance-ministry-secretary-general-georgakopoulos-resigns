Dimitris Georgakopoulos, secretary
general of the Greek  Finance Ministry  resigned, a ministry
official said.  Georgakopoulos, who was in charge of the government’s
efforts to improve tax collection, resigned for personal
reasons, the official said. No replacement has yet been named.  Boosting tax revenue has been a key part of the
government’s efforts to reduce the European Union’s second-
highest budget deficit. Government revenue has lagged targets
pledged to the EU and International Monetary Fund in return for
a 110 billion-euro bailout.    Greece  collected 8.3 billion euros ($11.6 billion) in tax
revenue in January and February compared with a target of 8.8
billion euros,  Naftemporiki  newspaper reported March 8, without
saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
