  Portugal ’s borrowing costs increased
at an auction of 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of bonds due in
2013.  The securities due September 2013 were issued at an average
yield of 5.993 percent, the country’s debt management agency
said. That compares with an average yield of 4.086 percent at a
previous auction of the same-maturity debt on Sept. 8. The
auction attracted bids for 1.6 times the amount offered,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.9 in September.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, on March 3 said the
total indicative amount for today’s auction was between 750
million euros and 1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
