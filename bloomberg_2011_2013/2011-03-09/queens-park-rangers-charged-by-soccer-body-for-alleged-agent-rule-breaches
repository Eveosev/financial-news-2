Queens Park Rangers and club
chairman Gianni Paladini have been charged with seven breaches
of Football Association violations relating to the contract
rights of player Alejandro Faurlin.  Faurlin, 24, joined QPR in 2009 from Instituto in his
native  Argentina  in a deal worth 3.5 million pounds ($5.6
million).  The F.A. said in a  statement  it had concerns over the
alleged existence of an agreement between the club and a third
party in respect to the midfielder’s rights, as well as an
alleged failure of the club to notify the governing body of the
agreement. QPR was also charged for allegedly using or seeking
to pay an unauthorized agent over the signing, the F.A. said.  The club and Paladini were also charged for false
information contained in documents relating to a contract
extension Faurlin signed in October, the F.A. said without
providing specific details of any of the allegations.  “Having cooperated fully with the F.A.’s investigation,
QPR and Mr. Paladini shall be denying all of the charges and
requesting a formal F.A. hearing to determine them,” the west  London  club said today on its website. QPR said it is confident
that there was “no deliberate wrongdoing involved.”  QPR leads the second-tier Championship by seven points over
Swansea, putting in position for a return to the Premier League
for the first time since 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
