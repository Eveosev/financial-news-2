Sally Meyerhoff, a top American
marathon runner who was training for the 2012 Olympic Trials,
was killed yesterday when she struck a pickup truck while riding
her bike. She was 27.  Meyerhoff, who was known for her long red hair that was
usually tied back in pigtails or a ponytail, died instantly in
the accident, which occurred in her hometown of  Maricopa,
Arizona . A preliminary investigation indicates she collided with
the pickup truck after failing to yield at an intersection,
according to the Maricopa Police Department.  There was no indication that the driver of the vehicle was
impaired, police said. An investigation continues, Maricopa
public information officer LaTricia Woods said in a news
release.  “She was a unique mix,” Brian Metzler, senior editor for
Running Times magazine, said in a telephone interview. “She was
Happy-go-lucky and definitely had a joyful attitude.  But on the
other side of that, she was a very intense competitor. She was
never one to settle or be content with anything but really good
results.”  Meyerhoff, who often wore bright colors and ran in skirts,
won the P.F. Chang’s Rock’n’Roll  Arizona  Marathon two months ago
in Phoenix with a time of 2 hours, 37 minutes, 55 seconds. An
All-American cross-country runner and track athlete while at  Duke University , Meyerhoff last year won a half-marathon title
in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
