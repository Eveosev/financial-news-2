Sweden’s money market participants,
purchasing managers and employers raised their expectations for
inflation one and two years from today as the impact of higher
food and energy prices trickles through the economy.  Inflation will average 2.5 percent in one year, compared
with a December outlook for 1.9 percent, a survey by TNS
Prospera commissioned by the Stockholm-based central bank showed
today. Inflation will be 2.5 percent in two years, versus an
earlier prediction for 2.2 percent, according to the survey.  The central bank has raised the benchmark interest rate
five times since July and signaled more increases will be needed
to steer the European Union’s fastest economic rebound. The repo
rate will average 1.8 percent in three months, 2.6 percent in 12
months and 3.2 percent in 24 months, according to a survey of
money market participants only.  “Unemployment has fallen slightly faster than was expected
the monetary policy meeting in December and inflation has
increased somewhat as a result of higher energy and commodity
prices,” the Riksbank said, according to the minutes of its
February meeting, published Feb. 28.  The survey was conducted between Feb. 21 and March 7. TNS
Sifo Prospera gave no margin of error.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
