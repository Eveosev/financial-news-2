Treasuries advanced over concern
rising fuel costs caused by an escalation in Libyan turmoil will
slow economic growth as the U.S. prepared to auction $21 billion
of 10-year securities.  Benchmark 10-year debt gained for the first time in three
days on speculation the auction of the securities concluding at

fluctuated. The  Federal Reserve  bought $6.7 billion of
Treasuries due from April 2015 to May 2016 to keep borrowing
costs low.  “We are projecting a small flight-to-quality bid,” said
Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at Tradition Asiel
Securities Inc., an interdealer broker. “Yields are stuck
between 3.40 and 3.60 percent on the 10-year note. If the market
rallies into 1 o’clock, it will be a tougher time to buy the
market.”  The yield on the current 10-year note dropped two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.53 percent at 11:33 a.m.
in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the
3.625 percent security due in February 2021 climbed 5/32, or
$1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 3/4.    Brent crude  for April delivery increased as much as 2.8
percent to $116.18 a barrel on concern turmoil in  Libya  may

Middle East. Disruption in Libyan supplies has cut output by as
much as 1 million barrels a day, according to the  International
Energy Agency .  Outlook on Oil  Bank of America Merrill Lynch updated its forecast today
for North Sea Brent crude, saying it may trade at more than $140
a barrel in the next three months.  “There’s concern high  oil prices  could be a tax on the
consumer,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New York
at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “Is it going to choke off
whatever legs the economy has right now?”  The average price of unleaded gasoline in the U.S. rose to
$3.517 per gallon, the most in 29 months, according to the
American Automobile Association yesterday.’  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.1 percent, while
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  was little changed.  Americans “will have less money to spend,” said  David Rolley , co-head of global fixed income at Loomis Sayles & Co. in  Boston , on the boost in oil. The company cut its 2011 U.S.
growth forecast to 3.1 percent from 3.5 percent because of the
surge in oil prices, Rolley said at a conference in Sydney.  Fed Rate View  Traders cut bets on the Fed raising its zero to 0.25
percent target lending rate in December, with futures showing
the probability of an increase falling to 36 percent from 51
percent a month ago.  The 10-year U.S. securities scheduled for sale today yielded
3.539 percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 3.665
percent the last time the notes were sold Feb. 9.  Investors bid for 3.23 times the amount of debt offered
last month, compared with the average of 3.08 for the past 10

yesterday, with investors submitting bids for 3.22 times the
amount of debt on offer, the most since November. The government
plans to auction $13 billion of 30-year securities tomorrow for
a total of $66 billion in notes and bonds this week.  Treasuries have handed investors a 0.6 percent loss this
year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
drop follows a 2.7 percent slide in the fourth quarter. Ten-year

in 2011 as investors added to bets inflation will accelerate.  U.S. Retail Sales  U.S. retail sales gained for an eighth month in February,
according to the median forecast of 81 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey before the Commerce Department’s report March 11.
