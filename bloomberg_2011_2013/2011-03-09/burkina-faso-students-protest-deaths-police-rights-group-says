Students in  Burkina Faso 
demonstrated in five cities to protest the death of a student in
police custody last month and other marchers killed in later
protests, according to a local human-rights group.  Demonstrations took places in Koudougou, Fada N’Gourma,
Tougan and Sabou, said Chrizogone Zougmore, president of the
Burkinabe Movement for Human Rights, by phone today.  In Ouahigouya, in the north of the country, students and
residents destroyed police and other government offices,
according to Emile Bayala, a resident who spoke by phone.
Viviane Compaore, governor of the North region, said in a phone
interview she was under military protection after the offices
were destroyed.  The student demonstrations began on Feb. 22 after the death
of Justin Zongo two days earlier in police custody. He died of
meningitis, Marie Odile Bounjoungou, the country’s education
minister, said on national television. Two people were killed in
protests on Feb. 23 and two students a police officer died on
Feb. 24.  Schools in  Burkina Faso  were ordered closed from today
until further notice, said Cloutan Samate, chief executive
officer of the government’s information department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
