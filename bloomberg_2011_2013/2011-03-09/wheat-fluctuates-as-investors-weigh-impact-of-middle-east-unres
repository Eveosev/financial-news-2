Wheat and corn rose for the first
time this week in  Chicago  on speculation that the U.S.
government will lower its estimate for world stockpiles.  The  forecast  may be reduced tomorrow by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture amid higher demand sparked by political turmoil
in North Africa and the Middle East.  Saudi Arabia  may increase
its purchases to avoid food-price inflation, which is partly
blamed for riots in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, the USDA said in a
report this week.  “Everybody thinks the USDA will cut its corn balance sheet
back and its wheat balance sheet back on better exports,” said
Owen Southwood, an analyst for marketer Dewing Grain in Aylsham,
England. “Things like Libya and the unsettled Middle East --
people get nervous about that.”  Wheat for May delivery rose 7 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$7.8675 a bushel at 1:14 p.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Milling wheat for May delivery, the most actively
traded contract on NYSE Liffe in Paris, gained 1.3 percent to
237.75 euros ($330.95) a metric ton.  Corn for May delivery advanced 4.5 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $7.10 a bushel in Chicago after three days of declines, the
longest losing streak for the most-active contract since Nov.
12. May-delivery soybeans were little changed at $13.8275 a
bushel.  U.S. exporters sold 300,000 tons of hard red winter wheat
to  Iraq  for delivery by May 31, the USDA said yesterday.  The Grain Board of Iraq signed 12 contracts last month to
buy a total of 850,000 tons of wheat from U.S. and Australian
suppliers, Director General Muthana Jabbar said in an e-mailed
statement.  Lebanon plans to buy more wheat this year to help keep
bread prices stable, Mohamed Zaineddin, head of the General
Directorate of Cereals and Sugar Beets, said yesterday.  The nation last month issued its first wheat tender in a
year, buying 15,000 tons from the U.S. and 7,500 tons from  Ukraine , Zaineddin said. Last year Lebanon imported about
400,000 tons, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
