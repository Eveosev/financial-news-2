Rigs used by energy explorers in
Asia fell in February from a 26-year high in January, according
to data compiled by  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  on its  website .  The Asia-Pacific region used 273 rigs on land and sea last
month, compared with 286 in January, said Baker Hughes, an
oilfield services company. Rig use stood at 259 a year earlier.  The region accounted for about 25 percent of last year’s
global rig use, excluding the U.S. and Canada. Oil demand in
emerging economies may grow 3.7 percent to 43.2 million barrels
a day this year, the  International Energy Agency  said in a
report on Feb. 10.  Oil in  New York  has climbed 14 percent this year as
investors bet the global economy is recovering. Crude futures
were at $104.56 a barrel in electronic trade at 4:47 p.m.
Singapore time.  There were 3,536 rigs operating worldwide in February, 554
more than a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes. The
international rig count, excluding the U.S. and  Canada , stood at
1,189 last month compared with 1,068 a year earlier, Baker
Hughes said. The figures include offshore and onshore drill
sites and exclude those in Iran and onshore in  China .  Baker Hughes has published rig counts since 1944, when
Hughes Tool Co. began weekly data on U.S. and Canadian drilling,
according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
