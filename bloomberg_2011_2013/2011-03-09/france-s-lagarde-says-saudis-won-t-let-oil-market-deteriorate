  Saudi Arabia  has the capacity and
willingness to prevent a surge in oil prices amid unrest in
Libya, according to French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde .  “The big producers have said they won’t let the market
deteriorate,” Lagarde said today on a visit to a gas station in
Paris. “Saudi Arabia has said very clearly they have spare
production capacity that would make up for even a total halt in
output from Libya.”  Gasoline prices are setting records across  Europe  as the
rise in crude prices caused by the conflict in Libya punishes
companies and consumers. Brent oil for April delivery rose as
much as 1.2 percent today to $114.39 a barrel on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  French gasoline prices reached 1.5067 euros a liter for the
week through March 7, surpassing a June, 2008 high of 1.4971
euros a liter, according to statistics published by the French
energy ministry. Prices for more widely-used diesel remain under
2008 levels.  “There is worry, but there are stockpiles,” Lagarde said
today. “We are watching for speculation.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
