OCI Co., a South Korea polysilicon
maker, won a $429 million order for the main ingredient used for
solar panels from a unit of  China â€™s Suntech Power Holdings Co.
The stock rose to the highest in almost three years.  OCI will deliver the polysilicon to Suntech Power
International Ltd. from January next year through to the end of
2018, the Seoul-based company said in a regulatory filing today,
without giving the volume of the contract.  The shares gained 3.6 percent to close at 417,500 won, the
highest since May 2008. The benchmark Kospi index rose 0.3
percent.  OCI received a $950 million order from China and a $108.8
million order from Japan last month.  Polysilicon prices in the  spot market  have risen to between
$74 and $78 per kilogram in March, near a high of $80 in
November because of demand from  Europe , JPMorgan Chase & Co.
