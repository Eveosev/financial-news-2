The  Bank of Korea  said that
inflation pressures will likely persist as growing demand at
home and abroad fuels the nation’s economic expansion.  The central bank repeated its pledge to ensure stable
prices with solid economic growth in a statement prepared for a
parliamentary session today. Governor Kim Choong Soo and his
board will raise the benchmark rate to 3 percent tomorrow, after
inflation breached the bank’s ceiling for a second month,
according to all 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The bank also said that it will continue to diversify the
investment of nearly $300 billion foreign-exchange reserves. It
will seek to find an optimal “strategic” asset allocation for
the funds, trying to improve their profitability and managing
them in a stable manner, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
