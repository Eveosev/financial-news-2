  Dynegy Inc. (DYN) , the third-largest U.S.
independent power producer, likely won’t be able to comply with
debt covenants this year, which may trigger a default, the
company said in a regulatory filing.  The company’s auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, raised
“substantial doubt” that the company can continue as a going
concern as the power producer said it may violate a credit
facility covenant in the third and fourth quarters, according to
a  filing  today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Shares fell 29 cents, or 5 percent, to $5.50 in after-hours
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Dynegy said in its filing it may need to amend or replace
its credit facility or secure additional capital to continue as
“a going concern over the next twelve months” as its  cash flow 
has been reduced by low power prices.  The company may also seek additional sources of liquidity
through assets sales, public or private issuances of debt,
equity or other securities.  Last month, Dynegy’s chief executive officer and all of its
board said they would resign after shareholders rejected
billionaire investor  Carl Icahn ’s $665 million takeover offer.
Icahn is in talks about appointing two people to the Dynegy
board, according to a March 1 regulatory filing.  Dynegy, based in Houston, reported earlier today a fourth-
quarter net loss of $164 million, or $1.36 a share, compared
with a loss of $355 million, or $2.33 a share, for a year
earlier, according to a company statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
