  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  shut a fluid catalytic
cracker at its Philadelphia refinery yesterday for repairs that
may last several weeks, according to a person with knowledge of
the situation.  A vacuum tower that had a fire March 7 has also been shut
for repairs expected to last about seven days, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the information isnâ€™t
public.  Planned work on a reformer and associated units is still
scheduled to begin in March 18, said the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
