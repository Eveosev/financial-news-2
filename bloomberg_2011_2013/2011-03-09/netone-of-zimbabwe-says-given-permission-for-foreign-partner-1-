  Zimbabwe  has agreed to allow foreign
investment in NetOne, the country’s state-owned mobile-phone
operator, said Managing Director Reward Kangai.  “We are glad that the government has taken the decision to
allow NetOne to partner a bigger player,” Kangai said today at
an investment conference in Harare, the capital, without naming
any potential investors. “The investment required by the
network points to a global player with operations in many
countries.”  NetOne competes with  Econet Wireless Zimbabwe Ltd. (ECWH) , the
southern African country’s biggest operator, and Telecel
Zimbabwe, a unit of Orascom Telecom Holdings SAE.  The company needs as much as $100 million investment in its
network a year to grow its subscriber base from the current 1.3
million and to roll out a 3G network and data services, Kangai
said.  “There’s definitely need for the government to reduce its
shareholding, governments are not in the business of running
companies,” he said. “NetOne offers a good opportunity to
foreign partners due to its already established
infrastructure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
