  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  approached
Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui & Co. over the possible sale of a
stake in its $35 billion Browse basin liquefied natural gas
project, the  Australian Financial Review  reported.  Woodside approached the companies about six months ago, the
newspaper reported, without citing anyone. It’s unclear whether
the company planned to sell down its own 50 percent stake or was
inquiring on behalf of its venture partners,  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  BP Plc (BP/)  and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , AFR said.  Mitsubishi President Ken Kobayashi and Mitsui counterpart
Masami Iijima voiced an interest in the project, West Australian
Premier  Colin Barnett  told the newspaper on a trip to Tokyo.  Woodside is the most likely party to dilute its stake given
the large spending commitment the project needs, the newspaper
said. The development, which will deliver 12 million metric tons
of LNG annually, is waiting for a final  investment decision  by
the partners in the middle of 2012, according to the report.  Woodside is Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas producer
and the Browse basin project is off Australia’s northwest coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
