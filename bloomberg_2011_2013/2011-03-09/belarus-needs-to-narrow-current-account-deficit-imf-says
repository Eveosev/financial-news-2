The  International Monetary Fund 
urged authorities in Belarus to curtail  government spending  and
to increase interest rates to narrow the country’s current
account deficit.  The Washington-based IMF, which forecast growth of 6.9
percent in the nation this year, said that a “relaxation of
macroeconomics policies” has spurred domestic demand, leading
to a current account shortfall of about 16 percent of gross
domestic product.  IMF executive directors “underscored that reducing the
current account deficit is critical,” the IMF said in an e-
mailed statement following a March 4 meeting that was released
today. “They emphasized the need for fiscal and monetary
tightening and cuts in lending under government programs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
