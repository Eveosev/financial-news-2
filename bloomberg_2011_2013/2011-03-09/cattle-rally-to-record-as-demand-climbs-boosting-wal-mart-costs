Cattle futures jumped to a record in  Chicago  as rising demand for U.S. beef erodes supplies of
animals for slaughterhouses and boosts meat costs for food
retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The U.S. cattle herd is the smallest since 1958 as beef
 exports  surged 19 percent in 2010 to about 2.3 billion pounds
(1.04 million metric tons), according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . Cattle prices have jumped 27 percent in the past
year, fueled by a global economic recovery that is boosting meat
demand in emerging economies, including  China .  Global food costs jumped to an all-time high in February,
the  United Nations  said. Surging corn prices have boosted beef
and pork as producers paid more for livestock feed. Food costs
contributed to riots in North Africa and the Middle East that
toppled leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia . The government says U.S.
consumers may pay as much as 5 percent more for  meat  this year.  “World demand and foreign demand for beef is so strong,”
said David Kruse, the president of CommStock Investments Inc. in
Royal,  Iowa . “It’s essentially diverting supply away from the
U.S. as we’ve seen a strong increase in beef exports.”  Cattle futures for June delivery gained 1.55 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $1.1745 a pound at 1:08 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. After the close of regular trading,
prices touched $1.18, the highest for a most-active contract
since the commodity started trading in 1964.  “A combination of export demand for end-meats along with
improving domestic demand for middle-meats ahead of the
spring/summer grilling season all helped packers in achieving
higher prices for beef,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of
Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in Chicago, said in a report.  ‘Inflationary Environment’  Wholesale beef has jumped 18 percent in the past year, and
at mid-day prices rose 0.9 percent to $1.7684, the highest level
since at least January 2004, USDA data show. Higher prices are
increasing costs for restaurants and retailers.  “We’re all dealing with a very different inflationary
environment than we were in just a couple of years ago,” Brian
Cornell, chief executive officer of Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club chain,
said in a presentation yesterday. “It’s going to continue to
impact the prices we pay for beef.”  The USDA estimates  net-cash  incomes for beef-cattle farmers
will drop 9.1 percent this year, which may limit prospects for
expansion.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 1.25
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.37375 a pound, and reached a record
$1.3775 after the close of regular trading.  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened on corn until they weigh about 1,200 pounds, when
they are sold to meatpackers.  Hog futures for June settlement added 0.275 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1.0195 a pound in Chicago. Earlier, the
price gained as much as 0.7 percent to $1.0235, the highest for
a most-active contract since at least April 1986.  To contact the reporter on this story:
