gained and oil, the country’s largest export earner, held above

0.4 percent to 1,788.1 by 11:31 a.m. in Moscow. OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest oil producer, gained 0.8 percent. OAO
Sberbank, the country’s biggest lender, added 1.5 percent while
OAO Magnit, the nation’s second-largest retailer, increased 0.9
percent.  “Oil prices continue to dominate markets and will probably
remain the key driver in the near term,”  Yaroslav Lissovolik ,
head of research in Moscow at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in an e-
