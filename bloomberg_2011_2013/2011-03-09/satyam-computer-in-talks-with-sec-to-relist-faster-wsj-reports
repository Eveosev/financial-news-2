  Satyam Computer Services Ltd. (SCS)  is in
talks with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to
shorten the time it would need to restate earnings under U.S.
accounting standards, the Wall Street Journal reported today,
citing Chairman Vineet Nayyar.   A restatement of earnings under U.S. accounting rules would
be one of the prerequisites for Satyam to be able to relist on
the New York Stock Exchange, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
