  China , the world’s biggest coal
consumer and producer, may increase net imports of the fuel to
174 million metric tons this year to cover a supply shortfall,
CCB International Securities Ltd. said in a research note.  The nation may purchase as much as 230 million tons of coal
each year between 2011 and 2015 as domestic output growth lags
behind demand, CCB analysts led by Karen Li said in the note
dated yesterday. Imports may grow 7.7 percent annually in the
five-year period, accounting for 5.6 percent of consumption by
2015 from 4.9 percent in 2010, according to the bank.  China bought more coal than it exported for the first time
in 2009 when global prices were lower than the cost of domestic
grades. Net imports, or overseas purchases minus exports, rose
to a record 146 million tons last year from 103 million tons in
2009, according to Chinese customs data.  “Our forecast reveals a potential supply deficit of 190
million to 230 million tons of coal in China lasting from 2011
until 2015,” CCB, a wholly owned subsidiary of China
Construction Bank, said in the report. “The shortfall would
need to be filled by massive coal imports.”  The nation may add 600 million tons of new production
capacity in the next five years, compared with 850 million tons
in the preceding period, according to CCB. Output growth may
slow to 3.4 percent annually in the five years through 2015 from
6.8 percent between 2006 and 2010, it said.  The price of power-station coal with an energy value of
5,500 kilocalories per kilogram at Qinhuangdao port, a Chinese
benchmark, may average 850 yuan ($129) this year and 900 yuan in
2012, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
