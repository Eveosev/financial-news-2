The U.K. accepted the demands of
Electricite de France SA and other power companies as it
overhauls its electricity market, U.K. Energy Minister  Charles
Hendry  told French newspaper  La Tribune .  The government began work in May and has finished its
consultation on an overhaul of the market, Hendry told the daily
in an interview. It acceded to requests from Paris-based EDF to
speed up the process for approving the design of new nuclear  power plants  and to prevent delays in providing permits for
constructing the facilities, Hendry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
