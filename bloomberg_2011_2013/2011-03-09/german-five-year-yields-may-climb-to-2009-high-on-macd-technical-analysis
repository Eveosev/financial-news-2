German five-year bund yields may
extend gains toward a 21-month high of 2.9 percent, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  The moving-average convergence/divergence indicator, or
MACD, signals yields may keep rising after climbing above the
2010 high of 2.5 percent last week, said Kenichi Imai, chief
manager of proprietary trading at the unit of Japan’s largest
financial group. Yields on five-year bunds jumped 20 basis
points March 3 after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said policy makers may boost  interest rates  in April.  “Five-year yields, being sensitive to monetary policy, may
keep rising for some time after breaching last year’s high,”
Tokyo-based Imai said. “The rates will target the level of
about 2.9 percent reached in 2009.”  Five-year bund yields closed at 2.62 percent yesterday in
Frankfurt after increasing from this year’s low of 1.76 percent
on Jan. 11. The last time they were above 2.9 percent was on
June 11, 2009.  MACD generates buy or sell signals when two moving averages
cross. The 12-day and 26-day moving averages intersected each
other on March 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Trichet’s remark came as a surprise and many investors
still appear to hold long positions on German bunds for two- to
five-year maturities, Imai said. A long position is a bet an
asset will rise.  “The sell-off will likely continue for a while as the ECB
enters a tightening stage,” he said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
