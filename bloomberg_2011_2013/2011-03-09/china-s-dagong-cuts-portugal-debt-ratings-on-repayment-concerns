Dagong Global Credit Rating Co. cut
its ratings on  Portugal ’s local and foreign-currency sovereign
debt to BBB+ from A- as government repayment ability erodes due
to the slowing economy and "uncertainty" over fiscal changes.  Dagong’s outlook on the ratings is negative, according to
an e-mailed statement. Dagong expects the Portuguese
government’s financing needs will account for 20.8 percent of
the country’s gross domestic product in 2011.  The debt crisis in the euro region will worsen this year,
said Dagong, one of  China ’s five official ratings companies.
BBB+ is its third-lowest investment grade rating.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
