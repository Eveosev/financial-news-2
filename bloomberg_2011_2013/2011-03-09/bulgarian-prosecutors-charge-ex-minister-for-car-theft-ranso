Bulgarian prosecutors charged ex-
deputy foreign minister Feim Chaushev with arranging the return
of a stolen car to its Turkish owner for a 25,000-euro ($34,700)
ransom payment.  The owner of an uninsured BMW sports-utility vehicle
contacted Chaushev after it was stolen from a hotel parking lot
in February and was told he needed to pay the money to recover
it, Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov told reporters in Sofia
earlier today. Chaushev was arrested yesterday at 8 p.m. as he
was meeting the person to whom the money was paid, after the
Turkish citizen contacted the police, Tsvetanov said.  The Sofia regional prosecution office charged Chaushev for
mediating a ransom payment, Russi Alexiev, the prosecution’s
spokesman, told reporters in Sofia today. Chaushev served as
deputy foreign minister between 2005 and 2008, when he resigned
over conflict of interests.  Chaushev wasn’t available for comment on his mobile
telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
