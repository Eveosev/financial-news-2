  Sudan ’s headline inflation rate was
little changed in February, rising to 16.9 percent from 16.7
percent in January due to the “general stability” of food and
beverage prices, the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said.  Headline inflation in urban areas accelerated to 16.1
percent in February from 15.5 percent in January, the Khartoum-
based agency, which monitors inflation in Sudan’s northern
states, said in a statement.  Food and drinks inflation, the biggest component in the  consumer price index , accelerated to 19.9 percent in February
from 19.8 percent in January, the agency said. Overall prices
rose by 0.2 percent in February, according to the statement.  Inflation averaged 13 percent in 2010, the agency said,
higher than the budget target range of 9 percent to 11 percent.
Inflation averaged 11.2 percent in 2009, the agency said.  Sudan is targeting inflation of 12 percent and economic
growth of 5 percent this year, according to Finance Minister Ali
Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
