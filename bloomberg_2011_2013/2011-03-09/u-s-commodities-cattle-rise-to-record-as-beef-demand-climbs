Cattle futures jumped to a record as
rising demand for U.S. beef erodes supplies of animals for
slaughterhouses and boosts meat costs for food retailers,
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The U.S. cattle herd is the smallest since 1958 as beef
 exports  surged 19 percent in 2010 to about 2.3 billion pounds
(1.04 million metric tons), according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . Cattle prices have jumped 27 percent in the past
year, fueled by a global economic recovery that is boosting meat
demand in emerging economies, including  China .  “World demand and foreign demand for beef is so strong,”
said David Kruse, the president of CommStock Investments Inc. in
Royal,  Iowa . “It’s essentially diverting supply away from the
U.S. as we’ve seen a strong increase in beef exports.”  In other markets, crude Oil fell for the second straight
day after supplies surged at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark grade.
Coffee jumped. The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity
Index dropped 0.6 percent to 1,758.95.  Cattle futures for June delivery gained 1.55 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $1.1745 a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. After the close of regular trading, prices reached
$1.18, the highest for a most-active contract since the
commodity started trading in 1964.  Global food costs jumped to an all-time high in February,
the  United Nations  said. Surging corn prices have boosted beef
and pork as producers paid more for livestock feed. The
government says U.S. consumers may pay as much as 5 percent more
for  meat  this year.  ‘Inflationary Environment’  “We’re all dealing with a very different inflationary
environment than we were in just a couple of years ago,” Brian
Cornell, the chief executive officer of Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club
chain, said in a presentation yesterday. “It’s going to
continue to impact the prices we pay for beef.”  Oil futures for April delivery dropped 64 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $104.38 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . On March 7, the price reached $106.95, the highest
since Sept. 26, 2008.  Cushing stockpiles rose 1.69 million barrels to 40.3
million last week, the highest since the Energy Department began
gathering data at the hub in 2004. Brent oil traded in  London 
climbed as Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  stepped up attacks on
insurgents.  “Supplies have risen to a record at Cushing, which makes
me want to stay away from crude,” said  Kyle Cooper , the
director of research for IAF Advisors in Houston. West Texas
Intermediate “has become its own little market, unrelated to
what’s happening elsewhere,” he said.  Coffee  Arabica coffee extended a rally to the highest price since
May 1997 on speculation that global supplies will continue to
trail demand.  The  International Coffee Organization  said in a report
posted today on its website that a “precarious” balance
between supply and demand in the global market “continues to
favor firm prices.” Inventories held by exporting nations are
close to a 40-year low, the group said last month. Futures have
more than doubled in the past year as world crops declined.  “Everyone’s holding onto their arabica beans,” said Fain
Shaffer, the president of Infinity Trading Corp., a commodity
brokerage in Medford,  Oregon . “The market is tight until
picking starts in  Brazil ,” usually in May, he said.  Arabica coffee for May delivery climbed 7.65 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $2.9485 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
