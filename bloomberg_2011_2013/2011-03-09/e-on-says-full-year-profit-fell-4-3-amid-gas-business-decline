  E.ON AG (EOAN) , the world’s largest utility
by sales, said profit may fall as much as 32 percent this year
after the German government imposed a new tax on its nuclear
plants and on reduced earnings from selling power and gas.  Adjusted net income, which E.ON uses to calculate its
dividend, will slip to 3.3 billion euros ($4.59 billion) to 4
billion euros in 2011 from 4.88 billion euros last year, the
Dusseldorf-based company said today. Adjusted earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization will drop to 11.2
billion euros to 11.9 billion euros this year from 13.3 billion
euros in 2010, the company said.  E.ON has responded to German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
plan to help plug the deficit with additional asset sales and
cost cuts. The utility reiterated that it expects adjusted
Ebitda to return to last year’s level in 2013 as it also
grapples with costs from long-term gas purchase contracts signed
before a slump in  gas prices  during the global recession.  “Especially in the gas segment E.ON should still be facing
strong headwind,” said Mario Kristl, an analyst at DZ Bank AG
who recommends investors buy the stock. “This segment suffers
from the current oversupply and low gas prices.”  The global gas unit will post adjusted Ebitda of 700
million euros to 1.2 billion euros this year, down from 2
billion euros due to “continued keen competition” and a
disconnect between wholesale and contract prices, E.ON said.  E.ON fell 21 cents, or 0.9 percent, to 22.9 euros as of
9:55 a.m. in  Frankfurt .  Outlook Okay  “The outlook for 2011 seems to be ok in our view, the
drop in adjusted Ebitda comes as no surprise,” Kristl said in a
note. “At the same time, we expect further progress within the
scope of the divestment program” and the utility is likely to
reduce net debt this year.  Earnings will be affected “to a lesser degree” next year,
according to the company. The utility’s forecast for 2013 Ebitda
returning “to roughly the 2010 level of at least 13 billion
euros” is based on the company’s current portfolio.  Merkel wants to raise an annual 2.3 billion euros in the
six years through 2016 from E.ON and  Germany ’s next three
biggest utilities. That will slice E.ON’s earnings by 1 billion
euros a year, the company said  in November .  Power Sales  German utilities sell power several years in advance so as
to reduce the effect of volatility on their earnings, meaning
E.ON will sell some of its electricity at prices set during the
recession. German power for delivery the next day averaged 40.85
euros a megawatt-hour in 2009, down 41 percent from 2008,
according to broker data on Bloomberg.  Adjusted net fell 4 percent last year from 5.1 billion
euros in 2009, missing the 5.15 billion-euro average estimate of
20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit fell on interest
prepayments for Germany’s nuclear fund, asset sales and as
earnings fell at the gas unit.  E.ON asked its gas suppliers late last year to sell it fuel
at spot-market rates rather than prices tied to oil, two people
with knowledge of the matter said last month. OAO Gazprom,
Russia’s gas producer, won’t agree to that, Sergei Komlev, head
of contract structuring and price formation at the company’s
export division, said Feb. 21.  The company’s supply and sales business will present “a
high level of uncertainty between 2011 and 2013,” E.ON said in
November. The unit will produce “a small profit” in 2013 when
the gas unit’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rise to 2.5 billion euros from 2 billion euros in
2010, according to a transcript of a Nov. 11 conference call.  Johannes Teyssen, E.ON’s chief executive officer, plans to
sell 15 billion euros of assets by the end of 2013 to use about
half of the proceeds to reduce debt and spend the remainder on
growth in two markets where the utility doesn’t operate. He
hasn’t yet identified the countries where E.ON will expand.  E.ON is more than halfway past that asset sale target after
agreeing to sell its  power grid  in central  England  for 3.5
billion pounds in cash to PPL Corp. and its 3.5 percent stake in
Gazprom for 3.4 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
