Copper futures fell to the lowest in
more than two months on concern that demand will wane as higher
energy costs slow the global economy.  Crude oil reached a 29-month high in  New York  on March 7
and rose as much as 0.9 percent today as Libyan leader  Muammar
Qaddafi  stepped up attacks on rebel forces, fueling speculation
that the conflict will persist. Copper stockpiles monitored by
the  London  Metal Exchange have jumped 22 percent from last
year’s low on Dec. 10.  “The price of oil is a game changer,” said  Matthew Zeman ,
a market strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago. “People
are taking the risk trade off and going back to risk-aversion
mode.”  Copper futures for May delivery dropped 12.6 cents, or 2.9
percent, to close at $4.2125 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the Comex
in New York, after touching $4.183, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Dec. 20. The metal has declined 9.6 percent from
a record $4.6575 on Feb. 15.  “Short-term trends have turned bearish,” Zeman said. The
metal may drop to $4.05 in a few weeks should prices close below
$4.20, he said.  Copper premiums in Europe slumped to a two-year low,
Standard Chartered Plc said in a report dated yesterday.  “Demand in China is still lackluster,” analyst  Dan Smith 
said. The country is the world’s largest copper user.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months slid $255,
or 2.7 percent, to $9,275 a metric ton ($4.21 a pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also declined in
London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
