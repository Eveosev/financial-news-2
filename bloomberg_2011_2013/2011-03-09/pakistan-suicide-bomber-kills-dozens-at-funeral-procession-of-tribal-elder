A suicide bomber killed at least 34
people and injured 31 others during a funeral procession of a
pro-government tribal elder in  Pakistan ’s northwestern city of  Peshawar , according to the Edhi rescue service.  “We expect the death toll to rise substantially as it was
a big procession,” Mujahid Khan, a spokesman for the service
said by phone from Peshawar.  Militants have escalated attacks on military and civilian
installations this month. Pakistan’s Taliban said they detonated
a car bomb yesterday that killed at least 25 people and damaged
an office of Pakistan’s main intelligence agency in Faisalabad,
the country’s third-largest city.  Peshawar has been a frequent target of bomb attacks since
the army launched offensives to end Taliban control of two
mountainous regions -- the Swat Valley and South Waziristan.  More than 3,900 people across Pakistan have been killed in 
attacks since October 2009, when the Waziristan offensive began, 
according to a compilation maintained by the New Delhi-based 
 South Asia Terrorism Portal .  To contact the reporters on this story:
