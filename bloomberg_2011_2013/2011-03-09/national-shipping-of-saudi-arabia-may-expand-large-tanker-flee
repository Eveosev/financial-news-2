National Shipping Co. of  Saudi
Arabia , an operator of crude and chemical tankers, may expand
its tanker fleet by purchasing so-called very large crude
carriers, a company official said.  “Our strategy is to grow,” Saleh Al-Shamekh, president of
oil and gas, said in an interview at the Marine Money conference
in Dubai. “We will buy if the prices decline further,” he
said, declining to be more specific.  New VLCCs cost about $100 million, down from $160 million
in 2008, Per Wistoft, chief executive officer at  Gulf Navigation
Holding (GULFNAV)  PJSC, said in an interview at the conference. Some 156
new VLCCs are needed to meet rising global oil demand, he said.  “VLCCs are not becoming cheaper,” Wistoft said.  The  International Energy Agency  raised its 2011 forecast
for worldwide oil demand for a fifth month in February, citing
increased consumption in Asia and signs of recovery in  North
America . Daily oil consumption will increase by 1.5 million
barrels this year to 89.3 million, the IEA said. A worldwide
total of 599 VLCC tankers are in operation, and about one-third
were built in the past five years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Oil prices, up 15 percent this year, fell 0.1 percent to
$104.94 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:30
a.m. London time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
