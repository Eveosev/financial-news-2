Benin , the West African nation due
to hold a twice-delayed presidential election on March 13, won’t
postpone the vote again, said President Thomas Boni Yayi.  “Despite opposition threats, I won’t delay the election,”
he said in a speech in Cotonou, the commercial capital,
yesterday. Boni Yayi is seeking a second term in office and
faces 12 opposition candidates.  The election was pushed back first from Feb. 27 and again
from March 6 amid concerns over the list of registered voters in
the country. More people will be enrolled today and tomorrow,
said Nassirou Arifari Bako, president of the political
commission that oversaw the registration process, by phone.  Opposition presidential candidate Adrien Houngbedji may
boycott the vote if “all people of voting age are not
exhaustively enrolled,” he told reporters yesterday. If the
president is re-elected “with the current register, we will
contest the results,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
