  South Korea ’s bank lending to
households rose to a record in February as people took out more
loans to buy houses.  Lending to households increased by 1.5 trillion won ($1.4
billion) last month to 431.7 trillion won after a decrease of 1
trillion won in January, the Bank of Korea said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Central bank Governor Kim Choong Soo may raise  interest
rates  by a quarter-percentage point to 3 percent tomorrow,
according to all 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. While
higher rates could help contain inflation that has breached the
central bank’s target for two months, they could strain debt-
bearing households, small businesses and low-income earners.  Mortgage lending rose 1.8 trillion won to 287.8 trillion
won, today’s report showed. Loans to companies rose 3.7 trillion
won to 526.9 trillion won.  The broadest measure of  money supply , M2, increased 6.5
percent in January from a year earlier, according to a separate
central bank statement. The gauge gained 7.2 percent in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
