Hungary’s government needs to plug a
fiscal hole of as much as 1 trillion forint ($5 billion) this
year to avoid the deficit widening,  Nepszabadsag  reported,
citing unidentified people.  The budget deficit “was a surprise” for the government,
according to the newspaper.  The government may channel tax revenues from local councils
to the central budget in exchange for assuming tasks currently
performed by municipalities, the newspaper said. Local councils
could also be granted the right to levy new taxes, according to
Nepszabadsag.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
