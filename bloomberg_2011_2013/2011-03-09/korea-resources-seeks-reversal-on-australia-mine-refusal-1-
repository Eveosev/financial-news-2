Korea Resources Corp., a state-run
mineral explorer, will urge the New South Wales state government
in  Australia  to withdraw its decision to reject a coal mine
proposal.  The state-owned company will send a delegation today to
Australia to deliver the request, Seoul-based Korea Resources
said today in an e-mailed statement.  The government refused the Wallarah 2 coal mine proposal
near Wyong because of unresolved concerns regarding subsidence,
water, ecological and heritage impacts, state Planning Minister
Tony Kelly said March 4.  A Korea Resources-led group, including SK Networks Co. and
a Japanese partner, has invested about 45 billion won ($40
million) on the project since 1995, according to Korea Resources
spokesman Kang Shin Young.  To contact the reporter on this story:
