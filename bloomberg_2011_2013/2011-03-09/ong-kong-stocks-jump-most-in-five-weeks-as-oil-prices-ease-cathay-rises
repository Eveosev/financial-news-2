Hong Kong stocks rose, sending the
Hang Seng Index to its highest level in five weeks, after crude  oil prices  fell, easing concern higher energy costs will derail
a global economic recovery.    Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Hong Kong’s No. 1 airline,
jumped 4.5 percent after reporting net income tripled and on the
prospect of lower fuel costs.  Air China Ltd. (753)  advanced 1.1
percent. Cosco International Holdings Ltd., which provides
shipping-related services, rose 6.3 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s
largest offshore energy producer, slid 0.3 percent after oil
fell for a second day.  The Hang Seng Index gained 0.4 percent to 23,810.11 at the
close of trading, the highest level since Feb. 2, with almost
four stocks advancing for each that fell on the 45-member gauge.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of so-called H shares of
Chinese companies climbed 0.8 percent to 13,088.93 today.  “The market will gradually shift away from concern about
oil prices to the strong recovery in emerging economies,” said
Danny Yan, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Haitong
International Asset Management, which oversees $600 million.
“In the medium term, energy demand should pick up in the U.S.
and  Europe  on positive signs of an economic recovery.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  has risen 3.4 percent this year as
corporate earnings and positive economic data from the U.S.
eased concern surging oil prices and tensions in the Middle East
will hamper global economic growth. Shares in the gauge traded
at an average 12.9 times estimated earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Airlines, Shipping  Airlines and shipping companies gained, while oil explorers
fell, after crude prices dropped for a second day in  New York  as
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
considered talks about increasing production because violence is
disrupting supplies from  Libya .  Cathay Pacific jumped 4.5 percent to HK$18.94. The airline
posted the biggest increase on the Hang Seng Index after
reporting annual net income that beat analyst estimates.
Cathay Pacific posted HK$14 billion ($1.8 billion) in profit,
exceeding the average HK$13.4 billion of 15 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Air China increased 1.1 percent to
HK$7.46.  Cosco International, which gets more than half of its
revenue abroad, added 6.3 percent to HK$5.09. Cosco Pacific Ltd.,
a container-terminal operator, gained 1.1 percent to HK$14.86.    Crude Oil   Oil producer Cnooc fell 0.3 percent to HK$18.32. PetroChina
Co., the nation’s No. 1 energy producer, slipped 1.1 percent to
HK$10.98.  Crude oil for April delivery dropped as much as 66 cents
to $104.36 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Shipping-related companies also gained today after the
Baltic Dry Index, a measure of commodity shipping costs, rose 3
percent yesterday, its eighth straight day of advances.  Among other stocks that rose, New World Development Co., a
property developer, advanced 0.7 percent to HK$14.46. The
company will reapply to list shares of its iron-ore mining unit
on the city’s exchange, the Hong Kong Standard reported, citing
people it didn’t identify.  Phoenix Satellite Television Holdings Ltd., a broadcaster,
also gained after it said its full-year net income increased by
41 percent to HK$421.8 million from a year earlier. The shares
advanced 7 percent to HK$2.92, the second-biggest increase on
the Hang Seng Composite Index.  Futures on the Hang Seng increased 0.1 percent to 23,760.
The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for  Hong Kong 
stock options, lost 1.1 percent to 18.50, indicating options
traders expect a swing of 5.3 percent in the Hang Seng in the
next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
