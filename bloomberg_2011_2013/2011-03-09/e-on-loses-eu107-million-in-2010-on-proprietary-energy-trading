E.ON Energy Trading SE , a unit of
Germany’s biggest utility, posted its first annual loss in
proprietary trading last year as the company became more active
in the power, natural gas and emissions markets.  The Dusseldorf-based arm of  E.ON AG (EOAN)  had an adjusted loss
before interest and tax of 107 million euros ($149 million) for
trading energy commodities for its own account, the company said
today in its earnings report for 2010. That compares with a 124
million-euro profit in the previous year. Overall, the unit
generated an operating profit of 1.2 billion euros, up from 949
million euros the previous year.  “After two positive years in 2008 and 2009, the
challenging environment that affected the energy markets in 2010
also had an impact on last year’s proprietary trading results,”
E.ON Energy Trading Chief Executive Officer Tony Cocker said by
e-mail today. “We expect this challenging environment will
continue in 2011,” he said.  E.ON integrated its regional trading offices in 2008 into a
new company led by Cocker. It bought and sold more power, gas
and emission allowances last year than in 2009. Electricity
trading volume rose 19 percent to 1,472 terawatt-hours, while
natural-gas trading gained 34 percent to 2,005 terawatt-hours.
Trading in emission allowances climbed 30 percent to 650 million
metric tons last year.  The company’s value-at-risk, a gauge of how much it could
lose on a given day, was 20 million euros by Dec. 31, up from
11.5 million a year earlier, the earnings report showed.  ‘Good Hedging Decisions’  The unit’s overall operating profit was attributable to
“good hedging decisions in past years, and as a result our
asset optimization performance again strongly contributed to the
2010 results,” Cocker said.  By comparison, profit last year at Electricite de France
SA’s London-based unit EDF Trading Ltd. fell 31 percent to 628
million euros before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, because of “a sharp deterioration in market
conditions since May 2010,” EDF said on Feb. 15.  RWE Supply & Trading GmbH, a unit of  Germany ’s second
biggest utility, said on Feb. 24 it earned a profit from trading
energy last year, without providing further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
