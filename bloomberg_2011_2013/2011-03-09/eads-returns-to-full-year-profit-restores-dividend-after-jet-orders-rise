European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. predicted earnings will hold steady this year before
climbing in 2012 and said getting production of its new Airbus
A350 aircraft up to speed remains “challenging.”  Earnings before interest, tax and one-time items will be
about 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) as improving volumes and
prices at Airbus counter costs from currency moves and research,
the company said today. Shares of EADS rose as much as 4.2
percent to 20.68 euros in Paris today.  The A350 jet, which incorporates cutting-edge composite
materials to make it lighter, is the “top risk program,” EADS
said. EADS is working to overcome snags that delayed the A380
superjumbo and development of the A400M military transporter. It
failed to meet its projections for delivering 20 of the double-
decker planes last year, handing over just 18.  “A lot of capex is invested in the A350 and for the team
this is really the number one topic we’re concentrated on,”
EADS Chief Financial Officer Hans Peter Ring said in a briefing
with journalists in Munich today. “We’re still planning for the
second half of 2013.”  EADS traded at 20.48 euros as of 11:45 a.m. local time, an
advance of 3.2 percent.  A350 Schedule  Boeing Co., whose 787 Dreamliner is about 50 percent
composite materials, is more than three years behind schedule.
The A350, Airbus’s response to the 787, is also about half
composite materials, yet its design departs less from the
traditional structure of planes.  Airbus is sticking to its target for delivering the first
plane by the end of 2013, though production numbers going
forward “are not carved in stone,” Ring said.  “From time to time there are changes in commercial
discussions with customers. It’s probably too early to give you
final ramp-up numbers,” he said.  Airbus has in the past said that the maximum rate of
production for the A350 would be 10 a month. The assembly of the
first A350 is scheduled to begin the end of 2011. Airbus to date
has won 583 orders for the A350 from 36 customers.  “We only have to look at the 787 to know it’s very
challenging to design and manufacture a composite airplane,”
said Chief Executive Officer Louis Gallois today on a call with
analysts. “Even if we’ve not adopted the same scheme as Boeing,
we know it’s difficult.”  Airbus, which contributes about two-thirds of the group’s
sales, is profiting from higher jet deliveries as demand for  air
travel  grows, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, whose
carriers will make up 30 percent of the global share by 2014.
Deliveries could reach 530 this year from 508 in 2010.  Rising Sales  Ring predicted A380 deliveries in the mid-20s for 2011,
even with some challenges in getting Trent 900 engines from
Rolls-Royce Plc after an engine explosion on a Qantas Airways
Ltd. plane last November. Modifications to the Rolls-Royce power
plant are causing the A380 production line to be a “bit
disturbed,” Gallois said.  While EADS’s Ebit will remain stable this year, revenue
will be above last year’s level, the company said. For 2012,
EADS expects a “significant” improvement in earnings amid
higher volumes, better pricing and the A380 outlook. The Paris-
and Munich-based aerospace company reported better-than-expected
net income in 2010 and proposed paying a 22 cent-a-share
dividend.  “They’ve largely stuck to the script with regard to their
forecast for 2012,” said Edward Stacey, an analyst at Espirito
Santo Investment Bank in  London . The company detailed its
forecast at an investor day in November, he said.  With a record cash position of 11.9 billion euros, Ring
said that EADS was in a good position to consider acquisitions,
particularly in  North America , to help expand its non-Airbus
portion of the business. EADS has said it could spend between 1
billion and 1.5 billion euros.  Ring today said he is “confident” that EADS will make an
acquisition in 2011, though he declined to give specifics on
location or size, saying it was ”somewhere in the Western
hemisphere.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
