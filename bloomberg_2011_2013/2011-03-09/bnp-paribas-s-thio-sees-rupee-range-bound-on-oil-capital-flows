Thio Chin Loo, a senior currency
analyst at BNP Paribas SA in  Singapore , comments on the outlook
for  India ’s rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency gained
0.2 percent to 45.29 per dollar as of 11:32 a.m. in Singapore,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will decline 0.6 percent from the spot rate of
45.03.  “I see the rupee range-bound at 44.50 to 46 for one month
at least.  “Positive for the rupee is India’s strong economic growth
and, hopefully, foreign investment will cover for any budget
slippages. High oil prices, a widening current-account deficit
and potential volatile capital flows are negatives for the
currency.”  The move by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries “to consider increasing production will bring down
oil costs. The decline in  oil prices  is positive for the
rupee.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
