U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said multilateral lenders such as the  World Bank  will
help the U.S. build relationships with new leaders in North
Africa.  Through multilateral development banks, “we stand ready to
forge a new partnership with a new generation in North Africa,”
Geithner said in testimony prepared for a hearing today before a
House Appropriations Committee panel. The  World Bank  and the
African Development Bank are prepared to work with new
democratic governments and the private sector “to promote job
creation, particularly for the region’s youth,” Geithner said.  Failure to finance a capital increase for the World Bank
“would lead to the loss of U.S. power to veto changes” to the
lender’s government agreement, Geithner said. The U.S. could
also “fall behind countries like China and  India ” if it
doesn’t adequately fund the multilateral development banks, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
