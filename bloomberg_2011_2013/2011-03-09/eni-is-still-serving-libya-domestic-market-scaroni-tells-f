  Eni SpA (ENI)  Chief Executive Officer  Paolo Scaroni  said the company’s  Libya  operation, while reduced
by almost two-thirds, is producing about 100,000 barrels of oil
a day for the “domestic electricity market,” the Financial
Times reported, citing an interview with Scaroni.  “If the international community tells us not to produce in
Libya, then we won’t produce,” Scaroni said, according to the
FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
