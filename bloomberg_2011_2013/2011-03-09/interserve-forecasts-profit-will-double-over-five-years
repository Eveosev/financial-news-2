  Interserve Plc (IRV) , a U.K. builder and
maintenance provider that’s considering buying  Mouchel Group
Plc (MCHL) , forecast it will double earnings per share in the next five
years as the U.K. cuts public spending.  Net income fell 28 percent last year to 49.7 million pounds
($80.5 million), or 38.5 pence a share, from 68.7 million
pounds, or 53.7 pence, in 2009, Interserve said in a statement.  Net income and revenue will be “stable” this year, Chief
Executive Officer Adrian Ringrose said in a telephone interview
today. The Twyford, southern England-based company spent 27
million pounds on purchases in  Saudi Arabia , Qatar and the U.S.
last year to broaden its international base, he said.  “We are feeling pretty upbeat about the medium term, 2010
and 2011 being a short interlude,” Ringrose said. “The
prospects are exciting.”  Interserve, which has agreed contracts this year from the
British Broadcasting Corp. and bookmakers William Hill Plc, said
Feb. 25 it’s in advanced talks about a possible cash-and-stock
offer for Mouchel, which rebuffed three offers from Costain
Group Plc.  The due diligence on Mouchel should be completed “in weeks
rather than months,” Ringrose said. “It is in everyone’s
interests to get this thing done.”  The shares rose 2 pence, or 0.8 percent, to 247.5 pence at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London trading, giving the company a
market value of 311.4 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
