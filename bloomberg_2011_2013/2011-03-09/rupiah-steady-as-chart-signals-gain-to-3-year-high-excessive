Indonesia’s rupiah rose to its
highest in more than three years and bonds gained on optimism a
drop in  oil prices  will give investors confidence to buy
emerging-market assets.  The currency has advanced 2.4 percent this year and 1.2
percent since Feb. 24 when Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor
Hartadi Sarwono said policy makers will allow appreciation to
help keep imported inflation in check. Oil declined for a second
day in  New York  on speculation the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will consider boosting output to compensate
for disruptions in  Libya .  “We watch out for oil and the situation in Libya,” said
Iwan Ridwan Gunandar, a foreign-exchange trader at PT CIMB Bank
Niaga in Jakarta. “The trend is still for the rupiah to
strengthen. Offshore investors want to buy central bank bills.”
The rupiah may trade between 8,700 and 8,800 this week, he said.  The rupiah appreciated 0.2 percent to 8,770 per dollar as
of 4:07 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency earlier touched 8,769, the highest level since June
2007.    Indonesia  imports about 47 percent of its fuel, according
to data from state oil company PT Pertamina. Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy rose 6.84 percent in February
from a year earlier after having increased 7.02 percent the
previous month, a report showed on March 1.  Ten-year benchmark bonds rose, halting two days of losses.
The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell 17 basis
points, or 0.17 percentage point to 8.38 percent, according to
closing prices at the Inter Dealer Market Association. The price
increased 1.1517 or 11,517 per 1 million rupiah face amount, to
99.0881.  To contact the reporters on this story:
