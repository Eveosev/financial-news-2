Mmeka Makina Ithalat Paz. & Tic. AS,
which won auctions for the Turkish   power grid , including that
of Istanbulâ€™s European side, got a 60-day extension to take over
the gas grid in Ankara, Vatan reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The company paid $36.3 million of guarantees to the asset
sales agency for the extension, the newspaper said.  Mmeka, a partnership between Mehmet Kazanci and Mehmet Emin Karamehmet, bid $1.21 billion in August for the right to operate
the  Baskent Dogalgaz Dagitim AS  grid; the extension is for
payment of that sum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
