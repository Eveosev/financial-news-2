The Philippine peso rose for the
first time in three days as signs the global economic recovery
is gaining traction and a retreating oil price helped shore up
support for emerging-market assets. Bonds were little changed.  Benchmark stock indexes advanced across  Asia  as crude oil
extended yesterday’s retreat from a 29-month high and Japan
reported a bigger increase in January machinery orders than
economists forecast. Global funds bought more Philippine shares
than they sold in each of the last three days, boosting their
holdings by $20.7 million, exchange data show.  “Inflows are going to Asia and we will see the peso
strengthening at a gradual rate,” said Rafael Algarra, a
treasurer at Security Bank Corp. in Manila.  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 43.39 per dollar as of 10:12
a.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The Philippine
Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.5 percent to a five-week
high of 3,919.13.  Crude oil fell 0.5 percent to $104.48 a barrel in  New York 
as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
considered talks about increasing production after an uprising
in  Libya  disrupted supplies. The fuel slid 0.4 percent yesterday
after ending March 7 at $105.44 a barrel, the highest closing
level since September 2008.  Japan’s machinery orders increased 4.2 percent in January
from the previous month, signaling that companies will boost
spending as the global recovery strengthens. That’s the biggest
gain since August and exceeded the median forecast for a 3
percent advance in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 was
unchanged at 5.2 percent today, staying at its lowest level in a
month, according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter for this story:
