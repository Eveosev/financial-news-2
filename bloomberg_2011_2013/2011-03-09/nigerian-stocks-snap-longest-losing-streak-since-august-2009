Nigerian stocks snapped their
longest losing streak since August 2009 amid speculation some
investors considered banking stocks cheap.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index rose 0.2
percent to 25,224.98, by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, according
to figures e-mailed by the bourse. The gauge fell for 10
straight days through yesterday.  “Investors believe that the banking sector is highly
undervalued,” Sam Onukwue, managing director of Mega Equities
Ltd., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone today.  Zenith Bank Plc gained 44 kobo, or 3 percent, to 15.30
naira, its highest since Feb. 25. Guaranty Trust Bank Plc
increased 30 kobo, or 1.6 percent, to 19.1 naira. Diamond Bank
Plc jumped 36 kobo, or 4.9 percent, to close at 7.71 naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
