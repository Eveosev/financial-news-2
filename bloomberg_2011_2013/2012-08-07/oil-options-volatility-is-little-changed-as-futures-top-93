Oil options volatility was little
changed as underlying futures rose to the highest since May 15.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.06 percent at 3:20 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 29.48 yesterday.  “Crude is starting to break out of the range and that’s
going to be a little volatile for prices, so volatility came off
the lows a little toward the end,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude oil for September delivery rose $1.47, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $93.67 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices
touched $94.42, the highest intraday level since May 17.  Futures climbed as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index touched
the highest level since May 1, led by commodity and industrial
shares, on speculation that central banks will add stimulus
measures to boost growth. Rebels in  Syria  said Prime Minister
Riad Hijab defected in the highest-ranking departure since an
uprising began last year.  The most active options in electronic trading today were

second-most active options, with 1,747 lots changing hands as
they advanced 5 cents to 25 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 51 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
