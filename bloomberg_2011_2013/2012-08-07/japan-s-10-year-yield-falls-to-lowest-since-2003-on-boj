Japan ’s government  bonds  declined
after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government backed the
 European Central Bank ’s bond-buying plan, spurring a rally in
global stocks that damped demand for safer assets.  The benchmark 10-year  yield  was set to climb the most in
almost five months after the Nikkei newspaper reported the  Bank
of Japan (8301)  will probably avoid adding to monetary stimulus at a
two-day meeting starting Aug. 8. Japan’s Ministry of Finance
sold 399.4 billion yen ($5.1 billion) of 40-year debt today with
demand for the bonds higher than the average of past 10 sales.  “Bonds are being sold after Germany expressed its support
for the ECB’s bond-purchase measures,” said Makoto Suzuki, a
senior bond strategist at Okasan Securities Co., one of the 25
primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales. “The
result of today’s auction is good.”  Ten-year yields climbed 4 1/2 basis points to 0.78 percent
at 4:37 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. That would be the
biggest gain since March 15 on a closing basis. The rate slid to
0.72 percent on July 23, the lowest level since June 2003.  Thirty- and  20-year rates  increased 3 1/2 basis points to
1.815 percent and 1.6 percent respectively. The  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares added 0.6 percent, following a 0.7
percent advance in MSCI’s World Index yesterday.  ECB Plan  Merkel’s government backed ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s
proposals on bond buying to help bring down borrowing costs in
Spain and Italy. Germany is “not worried” by Draghi’s
announcement of Aug. 2, deputy Merkel spokesman Georg Streiter
said in Berlin yesterday, when asked whether the government is
concerned that ECB independence might be compromised.  Japan’s sale of 40-year debt drew bids valued at 3.48 times
the amount on offer. The ratio, down from 3.99 at the previous
auction in May, is higher than the 10-sale average of 3.3.  The BOJ is likely to leave unchanged its view that Japan’s
economy is picking up moderately, the Nikkei reported today
without saying where it got the information.  A system error at the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange halted trading
of Topix index futures, Japanese government bond futures and
options today. The failure lasted from about 9:20 a.m. to 10:55
a.m. local time, the bourse operator said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
