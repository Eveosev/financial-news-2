Justin Verlander  had 14 strikeouts in
leading the Detroit Tigers to a 7-2 win against the New York
Yankees. It was the most in a game against the Yankees since
 Pedro Martinez  fanned 19 batters in 1999.  Verlander limited the Yankees to two runs -- neither of
which was earned -- over eight innings last night in Detroit to
improve his record to 12-7. Prince Fielder and  Miguel Cabrera 
hit solo home runs for the Tigers, who remain 1 1/2 games behind
the first-place Chicago White Sox in the American League Central.  Yankees starting pitcher Ivan Nova allowed seven earned
runs over 5 1/3 innings as New York fell to 63-45.  The  Philadelphia Phillies  had their streak of 257 straight
regular-season Major League Baseball home sellouts come to an
end during last night’s 6-1 loss to the Atlanta Braves. The
Phillies’ run was the longest in National League history and the
third best overall.  The Boston Red Sox beat AL West-leading Texas 9-2 yesterday,
dropping Rangers starting pitcher Yu Darvish to 1-4 in his last
five starts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
