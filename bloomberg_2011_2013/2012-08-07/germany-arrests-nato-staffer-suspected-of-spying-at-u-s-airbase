Germany  arrested a 60-year-old
civilian NATO employee suspected of spying at a U.S. airbase in
the country.  Investigators suspect the man, a German identified only as
Manfred K., gathered secret North Atlantic Treaty Organization
data at the Ramstein base in southwestern Germany, Marcus
Koehler, spokesman for Germanyâ€™s Federal Prosecutor Office, said
in an e-mailed  statement  today.  Manfred K., who was arrested yesterday, is suspected of
gathering the information with the intention of handing it over
to an unauthorized third party, Koehler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
