The automotive lubricants unit of
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as  Saudi Aramco , will award
contracts in October to expand its output capacity, Eqtisadiah
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The project at  Saudi Aramco Lubricating Oil Refining Co.  is
to be completed in the second half of 2015, the Riyadh-based
newspaper  said .  The lubricants company, known as Luberef, said in January
2011 that its production capacity would reach 1.3 million metric
tons a year when work at its Yanbu complex is finished in 2015.
 Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest state-run crude producer,
holds a 70 percent stake in Luberef, and Jadwa Industrial
Investment Co. the remainder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
