American Capital  Agency Corp., a
real-estate investment trust, plunged the most in 10 months at
today’s open as millions of shares traded before the stock
recovered about two-thirds of the loss.  Shares of the Bethesda, Maryland, company slid to their
 lowest price  of the day one minute after the 9:30 a.m. open of
exchanges in  New York , plunging 11 percent to $30.30 in five
trades totaling 524 shares executed on the Nasdaq Stock Market
and venues off exchanges, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. By 9:32 a.m., the shares had rebounded 6.4 percent
from the day’s low to $32.25.  The sudden drop in American Capital comes a week after
trading in dozens of companies went haywire in the first minutes
of the session on Aug. 1. That episode was later traced to a
computer malfunction at one of the country’s biggest market-
making firms that spewed orders by mistake. More than  24 million 
shares of American Capital  changed hands  today as of 12:08 p.m.,
about four times the stock’s average full-day volume this year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “It feels a lot like last Wednesday’s action,” said  Larry Peruzzi , senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets LLC in
 Boston . “Something is going on.”  Volume for  Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NLY) , the largest real
estate investment trust that buys mortgage debt, was almost 20
million shares. The  stock  fell as much as 3.3 percent to $16.25
before paring losses and trading down 1.7 percent at $16.51.  Representatives for American Capital did not respond to a
voicemail message requesting comment. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.
spokesman Robert Madden did not respond to requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
