Sudanese inflation accelerated to
41.6 percent in July from 37.2 percent in June, the Central
Bureau of Statistics said.  The cost of food and drinks, the biggest component in the
 consumer price index , rose 6.5 percent in the month as beans,
and red meat costs increased by as much as 11.6 percent, the
Khartoum-based agency said in an e-mailed statement today.  Sudan is targeting an inflation rate of below 17 percent
this year, Finance Minister Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul said in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
