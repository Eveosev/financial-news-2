Palm oil  may decline as much as 14
percent to the lowest level in two years by end-September or
early October as global economic concerns reduce demand, said
Hyderabad, India-based TransGraph Consulting Pvt.  Prices will drop towards 2,750 ringgit a metric ton and may
extend the slide to 2,500 ringgit ($807) as inventories build in
 Malaysia  and the export tax falls on crude palm oil from
 Indonesia , the biggest producer, Chairman Nagaraj Meda said in
an interview. The duty declines in stages and is zero below
$750. Prices last traded below 2,500 ringgit in 2010.  Futures fell for the third straight month in July on
expectations that lower shipments from Malaysia, the largest
producer after Indonesia, may boost inventories.  Meda, whoâ€™s predicted prices for over a decade, forecast in
March that palm oil would climb to 3,500 ringgit by mid-April,
before falling to 2,800 ringgit. The price closed at 3,613
ringgit on April 10, then fell to 2,846 ringgit in June.  The October-delivery contract fell 0.4 percent to close at
2,907 ringgit on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange today.
Futures have slumped 20 percent since reaching a 13-month high
of 3,628 ringgit in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
