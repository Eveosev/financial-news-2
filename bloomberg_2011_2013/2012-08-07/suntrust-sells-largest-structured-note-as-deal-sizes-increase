SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)  sold its largest
U.S. structured note last month, almost two years after entering
the market.  The bank issued $22.5 million of three-year, fixed-to-
floating rate securities on July 26, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg of sales registered with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The Atlanta-based  company  sold $27.5
million of notes in July, topping its total issuance of $23.4
million last year.  While SunTrust isn’t in the top 10 of U.S. issuers,
dominated by Bank of America Corp.’s $3.34 billion of sales this
year, the size of its offerings has increased since the first
one, on Oct. 26, 2010, Bloomberg data show. SunTrust’s deals
averaged $1.48 million in 2010, $5.86 million in 2011, and $10.2
million this year.  The three-year securities issued in July yield 2.4 percent
annually for the first 18 months, according to a prospectus
filed with the SEC. After that, they switch to 50 basis points
plus the three-month London interbank offered rate, with a
minimum coupon of 1 percent and a cap of 5 percent. The bank
distributed the notes for a 0.82 percent commission.  Michael McCoy , a spokesman for Atlanta-based SunTrust,
which has  $178.3 billion  in assets, declined to comment.  Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are
contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
