South  Korea ’s traded near a four-
month high after Germany’s support of a European bond-buying
plan eased concern the region’s debt crisis will drive
international investors out of Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.  The won closed at 1,128.78 per dollar, compared with
1,129.23 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
currency touched 1,124.00 yesterday, the strongest level since
April 3. The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due
March 2017 held at 2.87 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.  German Chancellor Angel Merkel’s support of the  European
Central Bank ’s plan may help ease the crisis in a region that
Korean exporters rely on for 9 percent of sales. Overseas
investors boosted their holdings of the Asian nation’s debt by
1.4 trillion won ($1.2 billion) to a record 89.7 trillion won
last month, the Financial Supervisory Service said in a
statement on Aug. 3.  “The progress we see in Europe is easing concern that
foreign investors may pull funds from Korea, supporting the
won,” said Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based currency analyst at
Woori Futures Co.  South Korea’s  Finance Ministry  said in its monthly report
today that the  European debt crisis , a slowdown in major
economies and weak domestic consumer sentiment are major
concerns. The central bank lowered its growth forecast for this
year to 3 percent last month from a 3.5 percent prediction made
in April.  BOK Meeting  Ten of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg say the  Bank of
Korea  will leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3
percent at a policy meeting on Aug. 9 after unexpectedly cutting
it last month. Six forecast a 25 basis point reduction.  “The central bank’s rate decision will have little effect
on the won if the rate is kept on hold, but may weaken the
currency if borrowing costs are lowered again as the decision
signals a negative outlook on the economy,” Byeon said.  One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell ten basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 7.18 percent.  Three-year debt futures climbed 0.02 to 106.26 and the one-
year  interest-rate  swap advanced one basis point to 2.82 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
