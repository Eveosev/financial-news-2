Chile  unexpectedly posted a trade
deficit of $95 million in July on falling exports and an
increase in imports.  The median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a  trade surplus  of $362.5 million. Exports fell 3.8
percent from last year to $6.1 billion and imports increased 1.3
percent to $6.2 billion, the central bank said in a report
today. Chile, the world’s top copper producer, exported $3.3
billion of the metal last month, down 3.3 percent on the year
before.  While the Andean nation’s dependence on raw material
exports makes it vulnerable to  Europe ’s debt crisis and  China ’s
deceleration, economic growth has proved more resilient than
expected and accelerated from the second half of 2011. Now,
evidence is mounting that the expansion will cool, Finance
Minister Felipe Larrain said yesterday.  “There is no guarantee we can continue growing and
creating jobs at the rate we’ve seen in past months,” he said
in a statement posted on the ministry website. “The Chilean
economy will decelerate in the second half of the year. The
effects of the external crisis are arriving to our country
through a lower copper price and reduced exports to Europe.”  Chile’s peso gained 0.3 percent to 476.65 per  U.S. dollar 
at 8:35 a.m. Santiago time.  Chile will post a $5 billion trade surplus this year, down
from $10.8 billion in 2011, as exports slip 2.6 percent, the
central bank said in its latest policy report published in June.
Imports will increase 5.2 percent to $74 billion in 2012, the
bank said.  Year-to-Date  Chile had a trade surplus of $4.6 billion in the first
seven months of this year, the central bank said today.  The average price of copper will decline 11 percent to
$3.55 a pound in 2012, according to the bank’s forecasts. The
metal has averaged $3.64 a pound so far this year.  The economy expanded 5.5 percent in the first half of 2012
from 4.1 percent in the second half of last year, according to
calculations made by Bloomberg based on central bank data.  Gross domestic product will climb 4.5 percent this year
after expanding 6 percent in all of 2011, according to the
median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The global
economy will grow at about half the pace this year, climbing
2.17 percent, according to a separate poll of analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
