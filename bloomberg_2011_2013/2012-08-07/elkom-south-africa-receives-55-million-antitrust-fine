Telkom SA Ltd. (TKG)  was fined 449 million
rand ($55 million) for abusing its dominance in South African
telecommunications between 1999 and 2004, less than the 3.25
billion rand the  Competition Commission  had sought.  Shares of  Africa ’s largest fixed-line phone company jumped
the most since March 7, advancing 4.4 percent to 18.84 rand at
the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The Competition Tribunal “concluded that Telkom leveraged
its upstream monopoly in the facilities market to advantage its
own subsidiary in the competitive value added network market,”
the Pretoria-based tribunal said in an e-mailed statement today.
“Telkom’s conduct caused harm to both competitors and consumers
alike and impeded competition and innovation.”  Telkom is studying the judgment and its implications, it
said in a statement today.  The  Competition Commission  investigated Africa’s largest
fixed-line phone operator and asked the tribunal to impose a
fine of 3.25 billion rand at hearings that lasted until early
this year. The commission’s probe followed five separate
complaints of anti-competitive behavior lodged by  Internet
service providers  between 2005 and 2007.  Telkom, based in  Pretoria , must pay half the penalty within
six months and the balance within the following 12 months, the
tribunal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
