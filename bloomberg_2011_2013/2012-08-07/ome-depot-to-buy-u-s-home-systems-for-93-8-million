Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, agreed to buy U.S. Home Systems Inc.
for about $12.50 a share to add products used in remodeling
kitchens and bathrooms.  The agreement has been unanimously approved by U.S. Home
Systems’ board and is expected to be completed this year,
Atlanta-based Home Depot said today in a statement. The offer
price is 38 percent higher than U.S. Home Systems’ closing price
yesterday.  The acquisition would give Home Depot a supplier of cabinet
refacing products, bath-tub liners and closet-organization
systems. The retailer said in May that sales this year may slow
from the first quarter after warmer-than-normal weather pulled
forward purchases of plants and gardening equipment.  The deal would value Irving, Texas-based U.S. Home Systems
at about $93.8 million, based on 7.5 million shares outstanding,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Home Systems advanced 38 percent to $12.53 at the
close in  New York . Home Depot rose 0.8 percent to $52.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
