Winifred Jiau, a former consultant
for Primary Global Research LLC who is serving a four-year
prison sentence for  insider trading , won’t be released while her
appeal is pending, a judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan today rejected
Jiau’s request to be freed from a prison in Dublin,  California ,
where she is serving her sentence. She had asked to be released
on bail until an appeals court rules on her case.  “The evidence presented at trial was more than sufficient
for the jury to find Jiau guilty,” Rakoff wrote in a four-page
order. “None of Jiau’s other contentions are sufficiently
likely to result in reversal, a new trial or a reduced
sentence.”  Jiau was convicted at a trial last year of passing along
earnings and other information about companies including  Nvidia
Corp. (NVDA)   Rakoff said he would no longer accept legal requests that
Jiau makes without a lawyer’s assistance. “All future pro se
motions will be returned unread,” he said.  The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 11-cr-161, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
