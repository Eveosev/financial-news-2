Serbia may agree an entirely new
agreement with the  International Monetary Fund  only toward the
end of 2012, when the government adopts next yearâ€™s budget, NIN
magazine said.  Three months are neither enough to tackle the inherited
budget deficit nor bring it back within 4.25 percent of GDP, NIN
reported, citing Milica Bisic, an adviser on tax to the Finance
Minister. The government is now considering raising taxes to
increase revenue and lower the fiscal gap, which may otherwise
overshoot the original full-year target of 152 billion dinars
($1.57 billion) by as much as 100 billion dinars.  The  Finance Ministry  may raise value added tax to 20
percent from 18 percent and capital gains tax to 15 percent from
10 percent, while also pondering higher excise duties and
personal income tax, Bisic told NIN in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
