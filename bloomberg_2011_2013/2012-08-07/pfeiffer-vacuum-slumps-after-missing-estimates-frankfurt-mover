Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology AG (PFV) , the
German maker of vacuum pumps used in the production of DVDs,
dried fruit and instant coffee, fell the most in four weeks in
Frankfurt after earnings and sales missed analysts’ estimates.  The pump manufacturer dropped as much as 6.3 percent to
78.77 euros, the biggest intraday slump since Jul. 11, and was
trading down 5.2 percent at 11:55 a.m., the biggest decline on
the  German HDAX (HDAX)  Index.  Equinet lowered its recommendation on Pfeiffer to hold from
accumulate, Adrian Pehl, a London-based analyst at the bank,
said in a note to investors today. Performance was “lower than
expected in basically all metrics.”  The decline in sales and profit was a result of weakening
demand from the solar, semiconductor and coating industries,
Pfeiffer said in a  statement  today, while “internal process
optimization” and exchange rate developments supported
earnings.  Pfeiffer’s second-quarter earnings before interest and tax
fell to 16 million euros ($19.9 million) from 19.9 million euros
a year earlier and compared with the average estimate of 17.6
million euros in a Bloomberg survey of 5 analysts. Sales dropped
22 percent to 110.3 million euros, the company said, missing the
average estimate of 120.2 million euros.  Second-quarter orders dropped 19 percent, to 110.7 million
euros, from the first-quarter level of 136.8 million euros. The
company confirmed its 2012 sales forecast of 470 million euros
to 500 million euros, as well its expected Ebit margin of 15
percent.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
