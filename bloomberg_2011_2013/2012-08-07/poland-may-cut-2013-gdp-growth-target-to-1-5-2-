Poland ’s government may cut its 2013
economic-growth forecast to as low as 1.5 percent due to the
euro region’s contraction, said  Dariusz Filar , an economic
adviser to Prime Minister Donald Tusk.  While Poland faces “no risk of recession,” the government
may need to “adjust” its forecast for growth next year to 1.5
percent to 2 percent, down from a preliminary estimate of 2.9
percent, as the currency bloc’s debt crisis intensifies and
“recession spreads across the euro countries,” Filar said in
an interview in Warsaw yesterday.  Ludwik Kotecki, the  Finance Ministry ’s chief economist,
said last week the government may lower its 2012 growth forecast
at the end of this month. The government approved a draft 2013
budget in June that assumed  growth  will accelerate to 2.9
percent from 2.5 percent this year. Eight of the 17 euro nations
are in recession, while the euro-area manufacturing gauge fell
to a 37-month low of 44 last month from 45.1 in June, an Aug. 1
report by London-based Markit Economics showed.  “Continuous hints from the government about a significant
slowdown may eventually convince the central bank to cut
rates,” Ernest Pytlarczyk, head of financial markets research
at BRE Bank SA in Warsaw, said by phone today. “Slower growth
makes fiscal policy more difficult and could change investors’
positive attitude toward Poland, although I don’t see this
happening before the final months of this year.”  Slowest Pace  In May, Poland’s central bank raised its  main rate  by a
quarter-point to 4.75 percent in the face of inflation that has
exceeded its 2.5 percent ceiling since October 2010. It will
return near the target only next year, the bank said in its
Inflation and GDP outlook on July 9.  The bank has kept its rate unchanged since the May
increase. Two of 10 members of the rate-setting council,
Elzbieta Chojna-Duch and  Andrzej Bratkowski , said last month
that policy makers should consider cutting borrowing costs as
early as September since growth may be weaker than expected.  An expansion of 1.5 percent next year would be Poland’s
slowest since 2001. The economy grew 4.3 percent in 2011, the
most in the 27-nation European Union except for the three Baltic
states, and 3.5 percent in the first quarter of 2012 from a year
earlier. It will be the fastest-growing EU economy this year,
the European Commission forecast on May 11.  The zloty declined 0.5 percent to 4.0637 per euro at 3:30
p.m. in Warsaw, the biggest daily decline in 10 days. The zloty
reached the highest since August 2011 yesterday. The average
yield on the 10-year government bond rose 11 basis points to
4.83 percent.  The government should revise next year’s growth forecast to
“about 2 percent,” Boguslaw Grabowski, another member of Prime
Minister Tusk’s economic council, told TVN CNBC today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
