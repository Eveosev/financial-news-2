The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission suspended final decisions on licenses for  power
plants  until it completes a reassessment of risks related to
storing spent atomic fuel ordered by a federal court in June.  The action by the five-member NRC today in Washington
doesn’t stop the agency’s review of license applications and
only final decisions, most of which aren’t expected for months,
will be held up, Scott Burnell, an NRC spokesman, said in an e-
mail.  Entergy Corp. (ETR) ’s Indian Point power plant north of  New York 
City is “next in line’” for renewal of its U.S. license, while
 Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) ’s application is close to getting a license
for construction and operation of reactors in Levy County,
Florida, Burnell said.  “They weren’t expected to reach final decisions until well
into 2013,” Burnell said in the e-mail.  The NRC’s rules on permanent storage of nuclear waste
failed to fully evaluate risks and new standards must be
drafted, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Washington ruled on June 8
in throwing out the agency’s regulations.  The NRC action freezes nine construction and operating
licenses, eight renewals, an operating license and an early site
permit, according to a statement from 24 groups led by the
Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Blue Ridge Environmental
Defense League in Knoxville, Tennessee, that asked the NRC to
halt the process.  To contact the reporters on this story:
