Magazines in the U.S. doubled
circulation of digital editions in the first half of the year
compared to a year earlier as publishers look to generate online
revenue to make up for declining print advertising.  At least 258 magazines had more than 5.4 million digital
editions of their print publications through June, according to
a  report  from the Audit Bureau of Circulations. That compared
with about 2 million in 2011. Total circulation was little
changed as paid subscriptions advanced 1.1 percent and newsstand
sales dropped 9.6 percent compared with a year earlier.  Digital circulation increased at the 87-year-old  New
Yorker , published by  Conde Nast  Inc. The weekly more than
tripled its digital circulation to 44,439 this year compared
with the same period a year earlier. Print circulation dropped
2.4 percent to 999,353 in the same period, according to the
Audit Bureau.  Game Informer Magazine, a monthly title about video games,
had the highest digital circulation with 1.22 million, a more
than fivefold gain compared with last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
