Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s former
head of digital banking fraud and security pleaded guilty to
submitting false invoices totaling more than 2.4 million pounds
($3.76 million).  Jessica Harper admitted to one count of fraud by abuse of
position and one count of  money laundering  at a court in London,
the  Crown Prosecution Service  said in a statement.  The fraud at the U.K’s second-biggest state-backed lender
is another blow to London’s reputation as a financial center,
which has been tarnished by separate revelations that banks
rigged the London Interbank Offered Rate and sold inappropriate
derivatives to small business customers.  Harper has been “convicted of the type of crime the bank
employed her to combat,” said Sue Patten, head of the CPS
Central Fraud Division. “She has admitted to a huge breach of
trust against her former employer.”  Harper admitted to submitting fake invoices between 2007
and 2011 and then laundering the proceeds, the CPS said. She
will be sentenced on Sept. 21, and faces as long as 24 years in
prison for the two charges, a CPS spokesman said, although she
will get credit for the guilty plea.  Ian Kitts, a Lloyds spokesman, declined to comment.
Harper’s lawyer, Emma Lipscombe, didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
