Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the
third-largest oil producer in Canada by market value, rose the
most since November as crude reached its highest level in more
than two months.  Canadian Natural, based in Calgary, gained 7.3 percent to
C$29.99 at the close in Toronto, after earlier rising as much as
7.5 percent, the biggest intraday price increase since Nov 3.  Canadian Natural, which operates the Horizon oil-sands
plant in northern Alberta, is among undervalued energy
exploration companies, Morgan Stanley research analyst Evan
Calio said in a note to clients today. Calio, based in New York,
said many energy shares are trading “near liquidation value.”  Crude oil for September delivery increased $1.47 to $93.67
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since May 15. Prices are up 6.4 percent this month.  The Canadian company produces oil and natural gas from
fields in North America, the North Sea and offshore West Africa.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  are the biggest
and second-largest Canadian oil companies by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
