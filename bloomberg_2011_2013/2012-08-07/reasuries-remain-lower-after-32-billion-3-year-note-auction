Treasuries dropped, pushing 10-year
yields to the highest level in a month, as better-than-estimated
corporate earnings damped the allure of Treasuries and sent
yields higher at a $32 billion sale of three-year debt.  The securities, which mature in August 2015, drew a  yield 
of 0.370 percent, compared with the average forecast of 0.361 in
a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21
primary dealers. The U.S. will sell $24 billion of 10-year notes
tomorrow, and $16 billion of 30-year bonds on Aug. 9.  “It’s a risk-on, risk-off type of trade,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of  interest rates  at primary dealer Cantor
Fitzgerald LP in an interview on Bloomberg Television with  Adam Johnson . “Treasuries have been the main loser in that trade. I
don’t see a move to much higher rates.”  The benchmark 10-year yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.63 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
maturing in May 2022 dropped 18/32, or $5.63 per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 3/32. The yield reached the highest level since
July 2. It touched a record 1.379 percent on July 25.  The yield on the current three-year note rose four basis
points to 0.36 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained for a third straight
day.  Auction Demand  “It was an adequate auction,” said  Michael Franzese ,
managing director and head of Treasury trading at Wunderlich
Securities Inc. in New York. “Stocks are doing better and it
puts more pressure on Treasuries. Things are not as bad as
everyone once predicted. It traps the Fed into doing nothing
now.”  Treasury trading volume reported by ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , increased to $235
billion, the highest since Aug. 3. Trading has averaged $241
billion this year.  Volatility rose to 73.9 basis points, just below the 2012
average of 75 basis points, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s MOVE index. It dropped to a five-year low of 56.7 basis
points on May 7 and touched a 2012 high of 95.4 basis points on
June 15. This compares with a record high of 264.6 basis points
in October 2008 as the financial crisis intensified. The index
measures price swings based on options.  Fed View  Fed Bank of Boston President  Eric Rosengren  said the
inflationary effects of the central bank’s securities-purchase
programs are a real concern, in an interview with CNBC.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, rose to 2.21
percentage points, touching the highest since May. The average
during the past decade is 2.15 percentage points.  The  difference  between yields on five-year notes and
similar-maturity TIPS rose to 1.95 percentage points, the
highest since May 11. The average during the past decade is 1.94
percentage points.  At today’s sale of notes, the  bid-to-cover  ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 3.51, the lowest since April and
compared with an average of 3.49 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 29.7 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 34.9 percent for the past 10 sales.  Bid Sectors  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8.4 percent of
the notes at the sale, the lowest since April and compared with
an average of 9.9 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Three-year notes have returned 0.4 percent this year,
compared with a 2.4 percent gain for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The three-
year securities returned 3.4 percent in 2011, while Treasuries
overall gained 9.8 percent.  The yield on the 10-year note is poised to climb to 1.67
percent with the break today of 1.596 percent,  MacNeil Curry ,
head of foreign-exchange and interest rates technical strategy
in New York at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in an
interview. A break of 1.67 percent means an end to the four
month bull-run, he said.  The firm is still bullish, calling for 1.24 percent on the
10-year security, but a break of 1.67 percent would “force us
to abandon this view,” he wrote in a report today. The “1.67
is the line in the sand,” he said in the interview. “If it
breaks, I’m going to go back to the drawing board.”  Technical Levels  On the 30-year bond, “a sustained break of 2.692 percent
opens a move towards 2.84 percent,” Curry wrote. “A move
through indicates a medium-term turn in trend. Until then, we
remain bullish for 2.07 percent.”  Investor appetite for the safety of Treasuries ebbed this
month when a U.S. employment report for July showed the nation
added 163,000 jobs, more than the 100,000 projected by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. It was the first time
since the report for February, released March 9, that the number
of jobs created exceeded the consensus forecast.  The U.S. central bank bought $2.3 trillion of mortgage and
Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing to cap borrowing costs. It’s now in the
process of swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings with
those due in six to 30 years to put downward pressure on long-
term borrowing costs.  The Fed purchased $4.5 billion of Treasuries due from
August 2018 to May 2020 today as part of the program, according
to the Fed Bank of  New York   website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
