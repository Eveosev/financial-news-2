Soybeans and corn advanced on
speculation that rains forecast in the U.S. may be unable to
revive plants that have been parched by drought in the world’s
largest grower. Wheat was little changed.  Thirty-nine percent of the U.S. soybean crop was in poor to
very poor condition as of Aug. 5, compared with 37 percent a
week earlier, the Department of Agriculture said yesterday. For
corn, 50 percent got the  lowest ratings , up from 48 percent a
week earlier. Temperatures across the Midwest may cool to near
normal this week, while storms may bring “moderate rainfall”
to much of the region by midweek, AccuWeather Inc. said.  “Cooler and wetter conditions show potential to lift
ratings, yet we view this as merely halting the yield slide,”
 Wayne Gordon , a strategist at UBS AG in  New York , said in a
report e-mailed today. Traders are looking toward the USDA’s
monthly crop production report on Aug. 10 for confirmation of
yield declines, he wrote.  Soybeans for November delivery gained 1 percent to $15.9925
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade as of 11:33 a.m. in
 London . The most-active contract reached an all-time high of
$16.915 on July 23 as the USDA said crops were in the worst
condition since 1988.  Corn for December delivery rose 0.6 percent $8.0975 a
bushel. The most-active contract touched a record $8.205 on July
31.  Drought may have slashed U.S. corn production to 10.792
billion bushels, 17 percent less than the USDA’s July forecast
of 12.97 billion, according to Doane Advisory Services Co.
Soybean output may total 2.73 billion bushels, below a USDA
estimate of 3.05 billion, the St. Louis-based researcher said
Aug. 3.  “The corn crop is past salvation,” because the grain
matures earlier than soybeans, economist  Dennis Gartman  wrote
today in his daily Gartman Letter. “It is lost, and the only
question before us is whether the crop deterioration shall take
the total crop size below 11 billion bushels, or just above that
psychological level.”  Wheat for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to $9.1025 a
bushel. The most-active price reached $9.4725 on July 23, the
highest since August 2008. In Paris, milling wheat futures for
November delivery gained 0.6 percent to 260 euros ($323) a
metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
