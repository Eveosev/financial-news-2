     Aug. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Air Arabia PJSC, the  Middle East ’s
biggest discount airline, reported a 31 percent increase in
second-quarter profit as revenue climbed, beating two analysts’
estimates.  Net income rose to 65 million dirhams ($18 million) from
49.6 million dirhams a year earlier, the Sharjah, United Arab
Emirates-based  airline said in a statement  to the Dubai stock
market today. EFG-Hermes Holding SAE estimated a profit of 53
million dirhams, while Securities & Investment Co. forecast at
51 million dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue jumped to 729.6 million dirhams from 592 million dirhams
a year earlier.  Air Arabia, which competes with state-owned FlyDubai, is
adding aircraft to its bases in Morocco and  Egypt  to capture a
rebound in demand for travel following last year’s so-called
Arab Spring, Chief Executive OfficerAdel Ali said March 20. The
company halted plans to establish a hub in  Jordan  in 2011 amid
concern about uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa.  The shares  rose 0.8 percent to 65.1 fils, headed for the
highest close since April 17, at 1:42 p.m. in Dubai. The stock
has climbed 11 percent this year compared with a 15 percent
increase for the benchmark Dubai Financial Market General Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
