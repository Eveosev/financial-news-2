Hungary’s forint weakened the first
time in three days as the nation’s industrial output plunged in
June, raising the chances of a second recession in four years.  The currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 277.21 per euro by
5:01 p.m. in Budapest.  Industrial production dropped 2.2 percent in June from May,
the statistics office said in a preliminary report today. Output
rose a workday-adjusted 0.6 percent in June compared with the
same month last year, missing economist estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey for a 2.2 percent expansion.  The  International Monetary Fund  last month urged Hungary to
step up efforts to boost growth and make budget financing
sustainable as part of a week of “constructive” loan talks
that the Cabinet said will resume in September. The economy
contracted in the first quarter. Second-quarter gross domestic
product data will be published on Aug. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
