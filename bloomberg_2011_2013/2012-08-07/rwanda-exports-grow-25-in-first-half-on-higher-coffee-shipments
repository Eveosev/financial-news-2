Rwandan exports grew 25 percent in
the first half, boosted by increased shipments of coffee,
National Bank of Rwanda Governor Claver Gatete said.  Total shipments climbed to $195.2 million in the six months
through June from $156 million in the same period a year
earlier, Gatete said at a briefing today in Kigali, the capital.  Coffee exports jumped 52 percent to 3,436 metric tons,
while tea shipments fell 11 percent to 11,900 tons, he said.  The countryâ€™s mining industry posted a 4.5 percent decline
in total export revenue to $64.4 million as tin prices declined,
Gatete said. Shipments of cassiterite, or tin ore, fell 42
percent to $27.2 million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
