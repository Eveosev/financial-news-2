Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI)  advanced to the
highest since April after the  Middle East ’s biggest discount
airline reported a 31 percent increase in second-quarter profit,
beating estimates.  The shares climbed 0.8 percent to 65.1 fils at the close in
Dubai, the highest level since April 17. Air Arabia was the
fourth-biggest gainer and the  most traded stock  on the benchmark
 DFM General Index (DFMGI) , which slipped 0.2 percent.  The airline said  quarterly profit  rose to 65 million
dirhams ($18 million). EFG-Hermes Holding SAE estimated a profit
of 53 million dirhams, while Securities & Investment Co.
forecast 51 million dirhams, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Air Arabia, which competes with state-owned FlyDubai,
is adding aircraft to its bases in Morocco and  Egypt  to capture
a rebound in demand for travel following last year’s so-called
Arab Spring, Chief Executive Officer Adel Ali said in March.  The results were “very impressive and beat consensus,”
said Chahir Hosni, equity sales manager at EFG-Hermes in Dubai.
The company is poised to continue earnings growth as “the
third-quarter is usually the busiest for Air Arabia,” he said.  The stock has climbed 11 percent so far this year compared
with a 15 percent increase for the emirate’s stock index.  Six analysts recommend investors buy the shares, another
six say hold and one sell, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
