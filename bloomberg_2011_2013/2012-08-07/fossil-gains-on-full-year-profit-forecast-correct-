(Corrects to remove reference to previous forecast in
headline, first and third paragraphs.)  Fossil Inc. (FOSL) , a maker of jewelry and
leather goods, rose in early trading after forecasting profit
that exceeded analystsâ€™ estimates on increasing sales of its
Skagen brand.  The shares  jumped  19 percent to $83.04 at 8:09 a.m. in  New
York . Fossil had lost 12 percent this year through yesterday.  Fossil forecast full-year profit excluding certain items of
as much as $5.34 a share, the Richardson, Texas-based company
said in a statement today. Analysts projected $5.27, the average
of 14  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  In April, the jewelry maker acquired Reno, Nevada-based
Skagen Designs Ltd. for about $252 million to bolster its global
brand portfolio.  Fossil sells its watches, handbags and other goods in
department stores, specialty retailers and through about 400
company-owned stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
