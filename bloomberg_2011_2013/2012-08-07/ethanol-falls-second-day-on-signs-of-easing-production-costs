Ethanol futures fell a second day in
 Chicago  on speculation rain and cooler weather in the Midwest is
helping the corn crop and will reduce production costs.  Prices followed corn lower on forecasts for rain and cooler
weather in the grain-rich region. One bushel of corn makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol and the cost of the grain is the
primary expense for producers of the fuel.  “We’re kind of weak,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at Price
Futures Group in Chicago. “We’re seeing a long liquidation in
corn” that’s spilling over into ethanol.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 0.6 cent to
$2.572 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
gained 17 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago gained 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.57 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
biofuel jumped 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.635, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  increased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.65 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive rose 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.765.  Corn for December delivery fell 4.5 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $8.005 a bushel in Chicago. Futures rose to a record $8.205
on July 31.  The Agriculture Department plans to release its latest
World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report on Aug. 10
at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Flynn said traders will be cautious until they see the
report and that prices for ethanol and corn will likely rise if
it shows crop deterioration, caused by drought in the Midwest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
