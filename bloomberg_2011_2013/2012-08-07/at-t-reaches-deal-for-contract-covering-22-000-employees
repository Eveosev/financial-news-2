AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, reached a tentative agreement with the  Communications
Workers of America  in contract negotiations for more than 22,000
land-line employees in the southeastern U.S.  The company forged a deal with workers in Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Tennessee, according to statement from the carrier
today. The three contracts will be submitted to the CWA’s
membership for a ratification vote, Dallas-based AT&T said.  The new three-year agreement, which replaces a contract
that was set to expire on Aug. 9, includes wage increases in
each year and “modest” pension increases, AT&T said. The
company reached an agreement with Midwest employees last month
and is still negotiating with the CWA on the East and West
Coast, where contracts expired April 7.  AT&T and competitors such as  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 
regularly negotiate with unions over new contracts as rising
network investment costs weigh on profit margins. More than half
of AT&T’s employees are represented by CWA, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers or other unions, according to
the company’s  annual report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
