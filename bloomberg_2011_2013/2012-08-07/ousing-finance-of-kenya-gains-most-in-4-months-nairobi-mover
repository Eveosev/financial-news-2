Housing Finance Ltd. (HFCL) ,  Kenya ’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, gained the most in more than
four months before the cut-off date for investors to buy the
shares and become entitled to an interim dividend.  The shares climbed 3.2 percent to 15.95 shillings by 12:55
p.m. in Nairobi, set for the biggest jump since March 28 and
highest close since June 25.  “They declared an interim dividend of 0.70 shillings when
they announced their first-half profit and based on that the
stock is getting some support ahead of the Aug. 17 cut-off
date,” Faith Atiti, an analyst at Nairobi-based Sterling
Investment Bank Ltd. said in a phone interview today.  The interim dividend compares with 0.50 shillings a year
earlier. The company said July 17 first-half profit climbed 3.6
percent as operating costs dropped. Net income grew to 250.4
million shillings ($2.98 million) in the six months through June
from 241.8 million shillings a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
