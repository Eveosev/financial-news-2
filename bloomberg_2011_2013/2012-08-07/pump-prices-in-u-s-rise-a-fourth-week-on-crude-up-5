Retail gasoline in the U.S. rose the
most in 17 months and may surpass year-earlier levels next week
following the shutdown of an  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  oil pipeline and as
crude trades above $90 a barrel.  The  national average price  for regular gasoline jumped 13.7
cents, or 3.9 percent, to $3.645 a gallon from a week earlier,
the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a report on
its website yesterday. That’s the largest weekly gain since
March 7, 2011, and the highest since May 28. The level is 0.8
percent less than the same time last year.  U.S. pump prices have risen for the last five weeks and are
up almost 21 cents a gallon since June following a rise in
crude, which accounts for about 66 percent of the cost of the
motor fuel. Gasoline in the U.S. Midwest has also surged after
Enbridge shut Line 14, which helps deliver crude to refineries
in the region, following a July 27 spill in Wisconsin.  “You’ve got crude up and you’ve got the Enbridge line
having a big impact,”  James Williams , president of WTRG
Economics in  New London ,  Arkansas , said by telephone yesterday.
“If we have any increase in crude prices next week, we could
match last year’s numbers or exceed it.”  Oil for September delivery traded today as low as $91.82 a
barrel, down 0.4 percent, on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
today. Futures yesterday rose 0.9 percent to settle at $92.20
after U.S. stocks gained and as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government backed the  European Central Bank ’s bond-
buying plan, adding to optimism that the region’s debt crisis
will ease. Prices are up $3.81, or 4.3 percent, this month.  Enbridge Pipeline  Enbridge gained approval from the U.S. Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration yesterday to resume
service on Line 14 in  Wisconsin  at 80 percent of the pressure at
the time of the spill. The company said in an e-mailed statement
that the pipeline was expected to return to operations today.  Gasoline futures on Nymex dropped as much as 3.6 cents, or
0.1 percent, to $2.9186 a gallon. Prices slipped 0.9 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.9222 a gallon yesterday.  Motor-gasoline inventories  fell 2.17 million barrels, or 1
percent, to 207.9 million in the week ended July 27, the Energy
Department said. Gasoline stockpiles probably declined 2 million
barrels, or 1 percent, to 205.9 million last week, the Bloomberg
survey showed.  Gasoline Demand  Average U.S. gasoline demand  for the four weeks ended July
27 fell 3.4 percent from a year earlier to 8.76 million barrels
a day, the Energy Department data showed.  Gasoline rose the most this week in the U.S. Midwest,
surging 25.7 cents to $3.772 a gallon, the Energy Department
report showed. Prices only declined in the Rocky Mountain
region, where regular gasoline slipped 0.3 cent to $3.463 a
gallon, the agency said.  The Energy Department conducts a telephone survey of about
800 retail gasoline outlets across the U.S. each Monday to post
weekly gasoline prices as of 8 a.m. local time that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
