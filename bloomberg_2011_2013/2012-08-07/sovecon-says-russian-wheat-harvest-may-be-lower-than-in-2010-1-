Russia , the world’s third biggest
wheat exporter last season, may harvest less wheat than in 2010,
when the country had the worst drought in at least 50 years and
banned exports,  SovEcon  said.  Russia planted about 2 million hectares (4.9 million acres)
less wheat this year than in 2010, and actual average yields are
now lower, the Moscow-based researcher said in a statement on
its website today. Wheat production this year is estimated at 49
million metric tons, compared with 41.5 million tons in 2010,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  “Seriously incomplete wheat harvest will lead to a
reduction of exports and domestic demand,” SovEcon said. Andrei
Sizov Jr., managing director at the company, was not able to
provide an actual yield number when contacted today. A crop
estimate was also not provided.  Wheat prices have climbed 31 percent this year, partly on
speculation dry weather will curb supplies from Russia. Deputy
Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  and Agriculture Minister
Nikolai Fedorov are expected to discuss grain supplies tomorrow,
according to the government’s press service and Dmitry Bobkov,
the Agriculture Ministry spokesman.  Russia was the world’s third-biggest wheat exporter after
the U.S. and  Australia  in 2011-12, according to USDA estimates.
This year, it’s forecast to slump to fifth place, with exports
of 12 million tons behind the U.S., Australia,  Canada  and the
European Union, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
