Mondi Group (MND) , Europe’s largest maker
of office paper, said the short-term outlook for uncoated fine
paper is for unchanged prices, while prices for corrugated paper
are increasing as it focuses on demand from emerging markets.  “Sales from emerging markets is 52 percent and growing,”
Chief Executive Officer David Hathorn said in an phone interview
today. Revenue from packaging products, which account for more
than 60 percent of sales, are also expected to increase “over
time,” he said.  Mondi plans to boost its consumer packaging business and
increase its presence in countries such as Poland, Hungary and
 China  through the purchase of Nordenia International AG, a deal
the Johannesburg-based company announced July 11. While demand
in a number of  emerging markets  remains firm, it is soft in
certain western European markets, the company said in a
statement today.  Mondi shares rose 1.8 percent to 72.60 rand at the close of
trading in Johannesburg.  Underlying operating profit fell to 269 million euros ($334
million) in the six months through June, from 354 million euros
a year earlier, Mondi said. The company declared an interim
dividend of 8.9 euro cents, an 8 percent increase from a year
earlier.  The newsprint unit made an operating loss of 3 million
euro, even as the Mondi Shanduka Newsprint joint venture in
 South Africa  returned to “a modest level of profitability,”
because of price increases. The company continues to seek
options for the Aylesford Newsprint business in  Europe , Hathorn
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
