Sotheby’s (BID)  said second-quarter
earnings declined 33 percent as auction sales fell.  Net income at the publicly traded art auctioneer was $85.4
million, or $1.24 a share, down from $127.2 million, or $1.81 a
share, a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Second-
quarter revenue fell 18 percent to $303.9 million.  The results fell from what Sotheby’s had called the most
profitable quarter in its history.  “Our results reflect the global economy, which we’re all
experiencing,” Chief Executive Officer William Ruprecht said in
a conference call with analysts and investors. “Income is down
because sales are down. The overall health of the business is
intact.”  Six analysts polled by Bloomberg forecast profit of $1.52 a
share.  The results included the May sale of a version of Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” for $119.9 million, the highest price
ever paid for an artwork at auction.  Leon Black  was the buyer,
the Wall Street Journal reported. Spokesmen for the auctioneer
and Black declined to comment.  Sotheby’s disclosed in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that as part of an agreement with the union
representing 42 art handlers, it offered severance to those who
quit. As of July 20, 35 of the 42 handlers had accepted buyouts,
resulting in a charge of $4.4 million. Before the agreement, the
workers had been locked out of work for 10 months.  Sotheby’s said in a release that “future labor costs have
been reset in an attractive and sustainable way.”  Sotheby’s shares rose 8 percent this year. Today, they
advanced 64 cents to $30.77 in  New York  Stock Exchange trading.
