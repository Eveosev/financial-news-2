Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said record U.S. student loan debt doesn’t put the
financial system at risk the way mortgages did because most
educational borrowing is backed by the government.  “I don’t think it’s a financial stability issue to the
same extent that, say, mortgage debt was in the last crisis
because most of it is held not by financial institutions but by
the federal government,” Bernanke said today at a town hall
meeting with teachers at the Fed in Washington.  Outstanding educational debt, which includes loans taken
out by students and their parents, is estimated at  $1 trillion ,
according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. About 15
percent is private student loans, issued by lenders including
banks. The rest is backed by the government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
