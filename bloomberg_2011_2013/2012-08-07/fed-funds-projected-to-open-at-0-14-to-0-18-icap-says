Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , is projected to open at 0.14 percent to 0.18
percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25
percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.15 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.23 percent and averaging 0.13 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will buy $4.25 billion to $5.5 billion of
Treasuries maturing from August 2018 to May 2020. The purchases
are part of the Fed’s program to replace $267 billion of short-
term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an
effort to keep borrowing costs low.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may also add reserves
to the banking system through  repurchase agreements  as part of
an “operational readiness program.” The transactions don’t
represent any change in Fed monetary policy and are part of the
central bank’s efforts to test its readiness to conduct
temporary open market operations.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
