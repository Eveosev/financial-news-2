Shanghai  plans to evacuate at least
200,000 people by tonight after China’s weather bureau forecast
the third typhoon to hit the country in one week will bring
heavy rains to the city, the Oriental Morning Post reported.  The evacuees will be moved to local schools and gymnasiums
before 9 p.m. local time, the newspaper  reported , citing an
official from the city Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters. The administration also encouraged people to seek
accommodation with relatives or friends, it said.  Typhoon Haikui, which strengthened from a tropical storm at
5 p.m. yesterday, was forecast to dump 250 millimeters (9.8
inches) to 500 millimeters of rain on parts of Zhejiang,
Jiangsu, Anhui and the municipality of Shanghai after it strikes
as early as tonight, according to the  China  Meteorological
Administration. Typhoons Saola and Damrey made landfall last
week, killing at least 16 people.  Zhejiang, which is closest to Haikui, recalled all the
fishing vessels, stopped most passenger ships and suspended
sales of tickets for several coastal railways, according to the
state-run Xinhua News Agency.  The typhoon was centered 330 kilometers (205 miles)
southeast of Xiangshan in Zhejiang, with winds as fast as 119
kilometers per hour as of 5 a.m. today, the  weather agency  said.
The storm would “slowly approach” Zhejiang at a speed of 10
kilometers to 15 kilometers per hour as it strengthens, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
