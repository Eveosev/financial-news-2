Geneva won’t attract as many
commodity traders in future,  Tribune de Geneve  reported, citing
Geert Descheemaeker, secretary-general of the city’s trading and
shipping association.  While the economic crisis will have an impact on jobs,
companies servicing an industry employing as many as 10,000
people will still grow, Descheemaeker, who will be replaced by
Stephane Graber on Oct. 1, told the Geneva-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
