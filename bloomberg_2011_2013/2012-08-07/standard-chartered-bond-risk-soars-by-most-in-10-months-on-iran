The cost of insuring debt sold by
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  soared by the most in almost four years
after the lender was accused of violating U.S. money laundering
laws by dealing with Iranian institutions subject to sanctions.  Credit-default swaps on  Standard Chartered  jumped 35 basis
points to a more than six-month high of 169 at 3:30 p.m. in
London, the biggest increase since October 2008. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Investors are concerned Standard Chartered will be damaged
after  New York ’s Department of Financial Services said the
London-based lender earned hundreds of millions of dollars in
fees from Iranian banks. Barclays Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc
and ING Groep NV have paid more than $1.2 billion in U.S. fines
since 2009 for violating trade laws with sanctioned countries.  “I’m not sure there’s a lot of material pressure behind
this headline,” said Roger Francis, an analyst at Mizuho
International Plc in  London . “They may have some liability or
fines, but of an order of magnitude that other banks have taken
without too much of a hit. I’m recommending buying the bonds if
they are available at these wider spreads.”  Standard Chartered said it “strongly rejects the position
and portrayal of facts” made by the state regulator. The firm’s
U.S. unit may be suspended from doing business in New York, the
regulator said.  Standard Chartered’s 7.75 percent bonds due 2018 fell 3.11
pence, or 2.6 percent, to 115.2 pence on the pound, pushing the
yield to a one-month high of 4.63 percent. The notes’ yield
premium to U.K. government debt widened 56 basis points to 392
basis points, or 3.92 percentage points.  High Yield  The cost of insuring corporate and financial debt
fluctuated with the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings down 1.5 basis
basis points to 582, while the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose one basis point to
148.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 2 basis points to 245 and the
subordinated index was up 4 at 403.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed six basis points to 245.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
