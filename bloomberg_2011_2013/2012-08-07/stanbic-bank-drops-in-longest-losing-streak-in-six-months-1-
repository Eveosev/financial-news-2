Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) , a unit of
 Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , fell for a fifth day, its longest
losing streak since Jan. 26, after the company announced
restructuring plans.  The stock dropped 3.1 percent to 6.20 naira by the close in
Lagos, its lowest since July 3.  Stanbic will cancel four-fifths of its shares this month as
part of its group’s restructuring into a holding company, it
said on July 26. Shareholders will receive 50 kobo for each
share canceled.  The restructuring plans have caused confusion in investors,
Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Lagos-based Kundila
Finance Ltd., said by phone today. “So they are exiting the
stock now to wait for the coast to clear before they re-enter,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
