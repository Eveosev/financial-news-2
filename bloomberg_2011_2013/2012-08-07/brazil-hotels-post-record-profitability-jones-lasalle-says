Hotels profitability rose to a record
in Brazil last year as rates jumped 17 percent, underscoring the
need for tourism infrastructure investment amid growing inflow
of visitors, a report by  Jones Lang  LaSalle Inc.’s hotel
consultancy unit and Brazil’s Hotel Operators Forum show.  Revenue per available room rose 21 percent on average to
147 reais ($72.47) at hotels in the country’s urban areas, the
steepest increase since at least 2005, according to the report,
which surveyed 400 hotels. The average daily rate was 211 reais
last year, up from 180 reais in 2010, and already increased 18
percent in the first five months of this year, the data show.  “Even amid the slowing economic growth, hotels were able
to raise rates that had been pressured in the past 10 years,”
said Ricardo Mader, head of Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels in  South
America , in a telephone interview from Guayaquil,  Ecuador  today.  Hotels in Brazil should continue to post positive results
in the coming years, with demand outpacing supply, he said.
“Projects being announced now should be ready in three years.
It’s not enough time for the  World Cup .”  The number of foreign visitors to Brazil rose 5.8 percent
in 2011 to more than 5.4 million people. Latin America’s biggest
economy has about 10,000 hotels, totaling 500,000 rooms, and is
expected to add 238 hotels and 38,854 rooms by 2014, Jones Lang
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
