Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  raised $1.25
billion with its second offering of 30-year bonds in less than
two months after beating analysts’ profit estimates last week.  The 4.5 percent, senior unsecured bonds maturing in
September 2042 were sold at 99.44 cents on the dollar to yield
183 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The second-largest U.S. cable-television provider’s $1.25
billion of 5.5 percent obligations due in September 2041 fell
4.1 cents to yield 4.7 percent with a 194.6 basis-point spread
at 3:06 p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Time Warner Cable, which last sold 30-year obligations June
20 with a 650 million pound ($1 billion) sale of 5.25 percent
securities, will use proceeds from the new bonds to fund general
corporate purposes that may include debt repayment, the New
York-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  The cable provider that was spun off from  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) 
in 2009 reported second-quarter  profit  of $452 million on Aug.
2, which exceeded  analyst projections  of $424 million, according
to Bloomberg estimates.  BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley managed
the sale, according to the filing. The new debt was rated Baa2
by Moody’s Investors Service, two levels above speculative
grade, and an equivalent BBB by  Standard & Poor’s .  Comcast Corp. is the largest U.S. cable company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
