South Africa  exported the most white
corn last week for 2012 as drought threatens the harvest in top
exporter U.S. and makes countries such as  Mexico , the second-
biggest importer of the grain, seek alternatives.  The nation,  Africa ’s biggest producer of corn, exported
92,856 metric tons of the white variety, used as staple food, in
the week through Aug. 3, the most since the week through Dec.
30., according to the  South African Grain Information Service .
That included 87,300 tons shipped to Mexico.  The worst drought in the U.S. since 1988 may have cut corn
production to 10.79 billion bushels, 17 percent less than the
USDA’s July forecast of 12.97 billion, according to  St. Louis ,
Missouri-based Doane Advisory Services Co. In South Africa,
shipments of yellow and white corn rose 18 percent from a year
earlier to 2.44 million tons in the season ended April 27, the
largest amount shipped in at least nine years, it said on May 2.
The African nation exported 1.16 million tons of white corn to
Mexico in the season ended April 27, making it the biggest buyer
of the country’s grain, according to Sagis.  “The exports we see now were previously organized and they
are mainly due to the fact that the crop is uncertain in the
U.S. where Mexico imports a lot of maize from,” Paul du
Plessis, a trader at  Brisen Commodities (Pty) Ltd. , said by
phone from  Pretoria  today. “We will be seeing a lot of these
exports of white maize to Mexico as they look to us as an
alternative to the U.S.”  South Africa didn’t import any white or yellow corn in the
week, the Pretoria-based organization said in a statement
published on its website today. It exported 2,690 tons of the
yellow variety to neighboring countries.  “We have a small surplus of white maize that we can
export. Exports are brisk and that is good, we have more vessels
in Durban going to Mexico,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone.  White corn for December delivery increased 1.6 percent to
2,796 rand ($344) a ton by the close in Johannesburg, while the
yellow variety rose 1.2 percent to 2,761 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
