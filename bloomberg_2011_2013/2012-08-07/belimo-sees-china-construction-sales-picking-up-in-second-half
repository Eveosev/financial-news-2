Belimo Holding AG (BEAN) , a supplier of
motors which control air-conditioning, says it sees recovering
construction activity in China after a government lending
cutback hampered investments in the first half.  Large construction projects have been re-started by the
Chinese government, Beat Trutmann, chief financial officer of
the Hinwil, Switzerland-based company said in an telephone
interview today.  “You don’t know of the smaller orders, but you know about
the bigger projects like infrastructure or airports,” he said.  Belimo’s outlook mirrors positive statements from  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) ,
which supplies low-voltage equipment like switches and circuit-
breakers to China’s construction market. ABB CEO Joe Hogan said
July 26 that he saw “some strengthening” in China’s
construction market and he hoped it would extend into the second
half.  Belimo’s first-half net income increased 12 percent to 29.6
million Swiss francs ($30.5 million), the company said in a
statement yesterday. Sales grew 0.7 percent to 217.5 million
francs, while three analysts estimated 228 million francs on
average in a Bloomberg survey.  “It’s probably not possible to have a normal year this
year which makes up for the first half,” Trutmann said of sales
in Asia-Pacific.  China  makes up more than half of sales for the
region. “But we expect an improvement,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
