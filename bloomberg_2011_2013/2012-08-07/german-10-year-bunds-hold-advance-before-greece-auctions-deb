German  government bonds  held an
advance from yesterday before Greece auctions 625 million euros
($774 million) of six-month bills.  Germany’s  two-year note  yield was within four basis points
of a record low. Similar-maturity Italian and Spanish bonds
jumped yesterday amid speculation the  European Central Bank  will
buy shorter-dated securities in an attempt to stem the region’s
debt crisis.  The German 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.39
percent at 7:46 a.m. London time, after dropping three basis
points yesterday. The 1.75 percent bond due July 2022 traded at
103.28.  The two-year note yield was at minus 0.06 percent. It
reached minus 0.097 percent on Aug. 2, the  least  since Bloomberg
began tracking the data in 1990.  German debt returned 3.5 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities fell 3.2 percent and Italy’s debt rose 9.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
