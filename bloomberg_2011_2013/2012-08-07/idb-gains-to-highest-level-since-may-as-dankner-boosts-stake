IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH)  rose to the highest
level in more than two months after shareholder Nochi Dankner
raised his direct stake in the company to 6.34 percent.  The  shares  gained 6 percent to 19.65 shekels, the highest
intraday level since May 20, as of 11:37 a.m. in Tel Aviv.
Discount Investment Corporation, a unit of IDB, added 14 percent
to 6.367 shekels.  Dankner, the Israeli businessman who controls IDB Holding
through Ganden Holdings Ltd., bought 75,569 shares yesterday at
17.89 shekels a share, IDB said in a filing to the Tel-Aviv
Stock Exchange today. The acquisition increased Dankner’s direct
ownership to 2.93 million shares.  Dankner has been purchasing IDB shares, which plunged 69
percent in the last 12 months as investors worry the company may
struggle to pay back its debt. Dankner on May 19 said he will
honor all his debt to investors and isn’t considering the option
of asking them to accept a so-called haircut debt arrangement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
