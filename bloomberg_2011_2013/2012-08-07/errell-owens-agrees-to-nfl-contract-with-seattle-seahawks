Terrell Owens agreed to contract
terms with the Seattle Seahawks as the former Pro Bowl receiver
seeks a return to the National Football League after missing
last season while recovering from knee surgery.  The Seahawks didn’t disclose terms of the contract in a
statement on their  website .  The 6-foot-3 Owens, 38, ranks second to  Jerry Rice  in NFL
history with 15,934 yards receiving. The Seahawks are looking
for a big target to replace  Mike Williams , the team’s leading
receiver in 2010 who was released last month. Seattle also
signed  Braylon Edwards  on July 31.  A five-time All-Pro, Owens is tied with Randy Moss behind
Rice for the NFL’s second-most touchdown catches with 153 and
has 1,078 career receptions, sixth on the career list.  While out of football rehabbing his knee, Owens said on his
reality television show that he’s had money problems, citing
mortgages on real estate and child support payments. He spent
three months with the Indoor Football League’s Allen Wranglers
this year.  The Seahawks, after going 7-9 last season, have also
bolstered their quarterback corps this offseason by signing free
agent  Matt Flynn  and taking Russell Wilson in the third round of
the draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
