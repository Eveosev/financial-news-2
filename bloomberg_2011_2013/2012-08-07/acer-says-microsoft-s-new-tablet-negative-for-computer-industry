Acer Inc. (2353)  said  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s
planned introduction of its own brand of tablet computers is
negative for the industry and would pit the  software company 
against its customers.  “On one hand Microsoft is our partner, but on the other,
Microsoft’s move makes them compete not only with us but all PC
makers,” Henry Wang, a spokesman for Acer, the world’s third-
largest computer maker, said by telephone today. “We think that
Microsoft’s launch of its own-brand products is negative for the
whole PC industry.”  Microsoft in June unveiled Surface, a tablet computer the
Redmond, Washington-based company developed that is powered by
its Windows operating system. The device will be available later
this year.  The Financial Times reported Acer’s comments earlier. Acer
is debating whether to continue relying on Microsoft software,
the newspaper reported, citing Campbell Kan, the Taiwan
company’s president for PC global operations. Wang said he
wasn’t able to confirm those comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
