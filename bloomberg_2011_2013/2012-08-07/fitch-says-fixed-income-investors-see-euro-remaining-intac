Managers of about $7.2 trillion of
European fixed-income assets see the euro area remaining intact,
according to a survey by Fitch Ratings Ltd.  Thirty-three percent of respondents in the quarterly poll
of investors said they expect a “move toward fiscal union” in
the  euro zone , while 31 percent see policy makers “muddling
through” the debt crisis, Fitch said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Five percent of investors see a “wide-scale breakup” of
the currency union, while 9 percent expect multiple sovereign
debt defaults, Fitch said.  The survey was conducted July 2 to Aug. 2 and Fitch will
publish the full results in mid-August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
