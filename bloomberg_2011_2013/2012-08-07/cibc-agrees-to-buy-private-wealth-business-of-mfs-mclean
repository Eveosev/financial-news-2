Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-largest bank, agreed to buy the private-
wealth business of MFS McLean Budden to bolster its wealth-
management operations.  MFS McLean Budden, a unit of  Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) ,
manages about C$1.4 billion ($1.4 billion) in assets for high-
net-worth individuals and families, endowments and foundations.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed as Toronto-based CIBC
announced the deal today in a statement.  CIBC Chief Executive Officer Gerald McCaughey has said the
bank was searching for wealth management acquisitions as a way
to reinvest capital. Last year it purchased American Century
Investments for $848 million.  The purchase “is in line with management’s strategy of
seeking attractive growth opportunities in the capital-efficient
wealth management space,” said  Michael Goldberg , an analyst at
Desjardins Securities in Toronto.  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter,
according to the statement.  CIBC shares rose 0.6 percent to C$73.65 at 11:37 a.m. in
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
