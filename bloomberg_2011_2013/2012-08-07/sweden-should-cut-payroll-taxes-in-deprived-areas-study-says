Sweden  should reduce payroll taxes by
more than half for businesses in deprived areas to create more
jobs and lower  unemployment , a government-appointed commission
recommended.  The employment tax rate for businesses established in areas
that have low levels of employment and education and many people
on welfare should be cut to 10.2 percent from the standard 26.3
percent starting in 2014 for as many as seven years, the group
recommended in a report to the  Finance Ministry . Annual
subsidies would amount to as much as 3.4 million kronor
($507,000) a year per company, according to the report.  “The purpose of the measure is to stimulate the
establishment of new companies and give existing companies
better opportunities to grow in deprived areas,” Christer
Sjoedin, head of the commission, said in a statement today.  Swedish unemployment rose to 8.8 percent in June, matching
a two-year high as the export-dependent country suffers from
weak demand from  Europe  where countries are cutting spending to
reduce debt. Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  has identified
unemployment, especially among the young and people born outside
of Sweden, as one of the nation’s main challenges.  The payroll tax cuts are targeted at companies with less
than 50 employees and annual sales of 10 million euros ($12.4
million). At least 25 percent of the employees must also live in
the specially designated areas, the commissioned recommended.  To contact the reporter on this story:
