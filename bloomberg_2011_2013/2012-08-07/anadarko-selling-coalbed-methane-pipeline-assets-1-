Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the second-
largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer by market
value, solicited bids for some of its assets, including coalbed-
methane properties in Wyoming and certain midstream holdings.  Anadarko has received bids for its assets in the Atlantic
Rim project in Wyoming, New York-based  Warren Resources Inc. (WRES) 
said in a statement today. Anadarko is its working interest
partner, Warren said.  Brian Cain , a spokesman for The Woodlands,
Texas-based Anadarko, declined to comment on Warren’s statement.  Anadarko’s possible sale may include coalbed-methane
holdings, a 50 percent stake in midstream gathering, compression
and pipeline assets, and mineral rights in deep formations that
may hold Niobrara oil, according to the statement. Warren will
decide whether to exercise its right to buy an interest in
Anadarko’s properties once it knows the results of the bids, the
company said.  On July 30, Anadarko reported a $628 million after-tax
charge in the second quarter that was mostly related to the
declining value of coalbed-methane properties because of lower
gas prices. In February, the company issued a fourth-quarter
report that included about $1 billion in after-tax impairments
that were mostly related to coalbed methane holdings.  Anadarko rose 3.4 percent to $70.53 at the close in New
York. Warren Resources increased 7 percent to $2.89.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  is the largest U.S. independent oil and gas
producer by market value. Independent  oil companies  don’t own
refineries or chemical businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
