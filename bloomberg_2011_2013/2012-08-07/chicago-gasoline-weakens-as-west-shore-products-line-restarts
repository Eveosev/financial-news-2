Chicago gasoline weakened after
Buckeye Partners LP’s West Shore pipeline restarted following a
 power outage .  The line carrying refined products west and north from
Citgo Petroleum Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and  BP Plc (BP)  refineries
in the Chicago area shut after a power failure at its Lemont,
Illinois, plant. The system returned to service late yesterday,
Martin White, a company spokesman in Breinigsville,
Pennsylvania, said in an e-mailed statement.  The 70,000-barrel-a-day West Shore line transports refined
products including gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
weakened 1.5 cents to 10 cents a gallon versus futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:36 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium for the same fuel in  New York  Harbor narrowed
0.25 cent to 1.13 cents a gallon versus futures.  PBF Energy Inc.’s Delaware City, Delaware, refinery had an
equipment malfunction yesterday, according to a filing with the
state’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental
Control.  Michael Karlovich, a Parsippany, New Jersey-based spokesman
for PBF, declined to comment on plant operations.  The refinery can process 182,200 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
