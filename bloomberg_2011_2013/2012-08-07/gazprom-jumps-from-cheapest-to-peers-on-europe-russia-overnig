OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s largest
natural gas producer, is rallying from the cheapest valuation in
nine months relative to Russian peers on prospects  Europe , the
company’s biggest market, will boost stimulus steps.  American depositary receipts of Gazprom, which ties its
contracts to prices of crude, rose 2.4 percent to $9.68
yesterday in  New York , rebounding from the cheapest valuation
since Nov. 9 relative to the average multiple for companies on
the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index. (RUS14BN)  The measure for the most
traded Russian companies in New York advanced to the highest
level since May 11 while the  RTS stock-index futures  fell 0.2
percent to 142,370.  Oil,  Russia ’s biggest export earner, climbed to a two-week
high yesterday after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government backed the  European Central Bank ’s bond-buying plan,
adding to optimism that the region’s debt crisis will ease.
Russia, the world’s biggest energy exporter, counts Europe as
its top trading partner and for about half of the revenue of
state-run Gazprom. The company’s share of Europe’s gas supply
rose to 27 percent last year.  “Many investors look at Gazprom as their gateway to
Russia, so when risk appetite rises, the stock benefits,”
 Alexei Kokin , a senior analyst of oil and gas companies at
UralSib Financial Corp. said by phone from Moscow yesterday.
“There is some optimism about the debt situation in Europe and
Gazprom gains. The stock remains particularly sensitive to risk
appetite and oil price.”  Russia ETF Advances  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, increased 1.5 percent to $27.53, the
highest level since May 4. The RTS Volatility Index, which
measures expected swings in futures, dropped 4.7 percent to
29.44.  Gazprom, based in Moscow, added 2.4 percent to 154.76
rubles, or $4.91, on the Micex yesterday. One Gazprom ADR is
equal to two ordinary shares.  The ADRs climbed to the highest level since July 19,
sending valuations to 2.89 times estimated earnings, up from
2.80 on Aug. 1, and almost half the 5.76 average multiple for
companies on the Bloomberg Russia-U.S. Index. Gazprom traded at
a 51 percent discount to the gauge on Aug. 1, the biggest gap
since Nov. 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gazprom links its prices to oil and refined products with a
time lag, a method that dates back to the 1970s, when the fuels
were more commonly used in power generation. The company has
slumped 9.4 percent this year while oil dropped 6.7 percent
during the same period.  CTC Gains  The Bloomberg Russia-US Index rose 1.6 percent to 93.63, as
 CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , owner of Russia’s fifth-most-watched television
channel, climbed the most in six months.  CTC, based in Moscow, will report today that second-quarter
revenue fell 6 percent to $192.3 million, according to the mean
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The ADRs jumped
5.2 percent to $7.66 yesterday after tumbling 5.8 percent last
week.  “The stock was beaten down so much that expectations are
at rock bottom and anything above the worst case can be a
positive relief,” Ilya Kravets, a portfolio manager analyst at
ED Capital in New York said by e-mail. “We have had the stock
for some time and had not traded it recently.”  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) , the country’s second-biggest oil producer
behind  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , advanced 1 percent to $57.95 yesterday in
New York, climbing to the highest level since May 3. The  stock 
rose 0.7 percent to 1,844.60 rubles, or $58.51, in Moscow.  Top Producer  Russia, the world’s largest oil producer outside of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, received about
half of its 2011 budget revenue from sales of oil and natural
gas, according to the government data.  Oil for September delivery rose 0.9 percent to $92.20 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the
highest settlement price since July 19.  Brent for September settlement gained 0.6 percent to
$109.55 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  Urals crude  rose 0.2 percent to $110.05 per barrel
yesterday.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
was unchanged at HK$4.24 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:01 a.m.
local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5 percent
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
