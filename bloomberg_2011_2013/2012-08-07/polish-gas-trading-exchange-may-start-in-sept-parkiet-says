Poland ’s energy market regulator
expects trading of gas on the country’s energy exchange to start
in September, Parkiet reported, citing the watchdog’s Chief
Executive Officer Marek Woszczyk.  The regulator wants at least 30 percent of gas used in
Poland to be traded on the exchange at the beginning and then
the amount should rise to 70 percent, Woszczyk told the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
