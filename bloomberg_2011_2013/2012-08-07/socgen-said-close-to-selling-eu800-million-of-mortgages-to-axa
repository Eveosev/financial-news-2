Societe Generale SA (GLE) , France’s second-
largest bank, is close to selling about 800 million euros ($994
million) of mortgage loans to  Axa SA (CS) ’s real-estate unit, said
two people with knowledge of the matter.  The French bank may sell the mortgages, mostly secured
against French and German property, to the unit of Paris-based
 Axa (CS)  at a discount of less than 10 percent, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Societe Generale, led by Chief Executive Officer  Frederic Oudea , is among European banks trimming balance sheets to comply
with stricter capital rules. The Paris-based company sold 7.7
billion euros of loan portfolios in the first half, with a 5
percent average discount, the bank said Aug. 1.  Officials for Societe Generale and Axa Real Estate, the
property unit of Europe’s second-largest insurer, declined to
comment.  Axa’s real-estate division raised 2 billion euros in
February to invest in debt in European countries including
France and Germany. Axa’s division will invest “primarily” in
senior debt backed by prime properties, it said Feb. 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
