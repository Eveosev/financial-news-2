The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia  index  rose 2 basis points to
158 basis points as of 10:29 a.m. in Sydney,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
prices show. The gauge dropped 11 basis points to 156 basis
points yesterday, the lowest since May 3, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan  index  increased 1.5 basis points to
206.5 as of 9:10 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
The measure is poised for its highest close since May 24, CMA
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia  index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 1 basis point to 149.5 as of
8:12 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The index has declined 11 basis points over the previous
two trading days, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
