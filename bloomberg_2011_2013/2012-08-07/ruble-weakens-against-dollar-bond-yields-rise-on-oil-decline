The ruble depreciated against the
dollar for the first day in three and yields on  Russia ’s local
debt rose as oil, the country’s main export, declined.  The Russian currency lost 0.3 percent to 31.6735 per dollar
as of 10:35 a.m. in Moscow, paring yesterday’s 1.3-percent gain.
Russia’s 54 billion rubles ($1.7 billion) of local debt due
February 2027 fell, increasing the yield by four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.31 percent.  Brent crude  dropped 0.3 percent to $109.28 per barrel as
investors sought to profit from its 3.4-percent gain over the
previous two trading sessions. Oil and gas together contribute
about 50 percent of Russia’s state revenue, according to the
government’s estimates.  The ruble dropped 0.2 percent to 39.23 per euro and 35.08
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket. Investors
increased bets on the currency weakening, with non-deliverable
forwards showing the ruble at 32.1604 per dollar in three
months, compared with expectations of 32.089 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
