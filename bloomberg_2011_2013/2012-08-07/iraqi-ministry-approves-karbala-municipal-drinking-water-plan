Iraq’s municipalities ministry has
allocated 11.5 billion dinars ($9.9 million) for a project to
expand drinking water supplies in Karbala, southwest of  Baghdad .  The project calls for drinking water from two stations for
about 35 neighborhoods in the Karbala area, the Aswat al-Iraq
news agency said, citing Jassem al-Fatlawi, head of Karbala
council’s water commission. No other details were disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
