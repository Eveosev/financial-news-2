Norway ’s krone rose to its highest
level against the dollar in more than six weeks as a report
showed a measure of Norway’s manufacturing production
unexpectedly increased in June.  The Norwegian currency strengthened against all 16 of its
major peers tracked by Bloomberg as data showed  factory output 
expanded 0.8 percent from May, when it grew a revised 0.6
percent. The outcome compares with a forecast rise of 0.4
percent in a Bloomberg News survey.  Industrial production 
climbed 4.3 percent in the 12 months to June, up from 1.7
percent in May. The krone approached its strongest level versus
the euro in 9 1/2 years.  “We’ve had better-than-expected data from Norway, and an
upward revision from last month, which is a contributing
factor,” to the strength of the krone, said Jane Foley, a
senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in  London .  The krone appreciated 0.7 percent to 5.9197 against the
dollar at 2:31 p.m. London time, after reaching 5.9149, the
strongest since June 21. The Norwegian currency gained 0.4
percent to 7.3620 per euro. It touched 7.3475 on July 23, the
highest since January 2003, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
