Swiss unemployment remained steady in
July, suggesting the economy is holding up in the face of a
worsening European fiscal crisis.  The jobless rate, adjusted for seasonal swings, held at 2.9
percent from June, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in
Bern said in an e-mailed statement today. The unadjusted jobless
rate was unchanged at 2.7 percent, todayâ€™s report showed. The
number of job openings fell by 381 to 17,112 in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
