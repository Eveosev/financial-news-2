Peru’s sol appreciated as speculation
that central banks would act to boost growth in Europe and the
U.S. added to demand for higher-yield emerging-market
currencies.  The sol climbed 0.1 percent to 2.6175 per  U.S. dollar 
according to prices from the local unit of Deutsche Bank AG.
That level is the strongest since 1996, data from Peru’s
financial regulator indicate. Peru’s central bank today said on
its website it had bought $2 million of U.S. currency in the
 spot market  to slow the sol’s advance.  Speculation that the  European Central Bank  will buy bonds
and the U.S. Federal Reserve will add stimulus increased
appetite for commodities and emerging-market currencies. Peru’s
economy, the fastest-growing in the region, and a benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged at 4.25 percent since May last year make
it attractive to investors looking for higher yields than they
can find in developed markets  “This doesn’t have much to do with  Peru  specifically, it
has more to do with the external scenario and attitudes to risk-
taking and the carry trade,” said Kathryn Rooney Vera, an
emerging-market analyst at Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami.  The sol was the only major Latin American currency to
appreciate last year. It has gained 3 percent against the dollar
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
