Palm oil fell to the lowest level in
more than a week on speculation that stockpiles in  Malaysia , the
second-largest grower, may increase amid a seasonal jump in
production and drop in exports.  The October-delivery contract dropped 0.4 percent to close
at 2,907 ringgit ($938) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest settlement price since July 26. Futures
have dropped 8.4 percent this year.  Stockpiles gained 10 percent to 1.87 million tons in July
from 1.7 million tons in June, according to the median in a
Bloomberg survey of four analysts and one plantation company.
Exports declined 9.8 percent to 1.38 million tons, while  output 
rose 9.5 percent to 1.61 million tons, the survey showed. The
Malaysian Palm Oil Board releases the data on Aug. 10.  “ Palm oil  fell on concerns that higher production in the
high output months may lead to a build-up of stockpiles amid
tepid demand,” said Paramalingam Supramaniam, a director at
Pelindung Bestari Sdn. “End-buyers have lots of oil in their
pipeline. There’s no rush to stockpile as they foresee lower
prices in the near future.”  Soybean oil  for December delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
52.78 cents per pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans
for November delivery rose 1 percent to $15.995 a bushel. Palm
oil and soybean oil are used in foods and fuels.  Palm oil for January delivery gained 0.5 percent to close
at 7,826  yuan  ($1,229) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month climbed 0.9 percent
to end at 9,612 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
