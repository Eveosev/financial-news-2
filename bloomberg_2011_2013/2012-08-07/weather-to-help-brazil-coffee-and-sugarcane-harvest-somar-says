The absence of rain and the warm
weather in the next ten days in the Southeastern region of
 Brazil , the biggest producing area, will benefit the harvests of
coffee and sugarcane in the country, Somar Meteorologia said.  Sao Paulo state has harvested 60 percent of its coffee,
while Minas Gerais harvest reached 55 percent of their
production, and the weather has also improved the harvest of
premium coffee, the weather consultant said in a report sent by
e-mail.  The weather is also helping to increase the productivity of
sugarcane in Brazil, benefiting specially the production of
sugar and ethanol, Somar said in a different e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
