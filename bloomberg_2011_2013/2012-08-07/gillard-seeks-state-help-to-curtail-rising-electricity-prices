Australia , which introduced a price
on  carbon emissions  last month, is seeking help from state
governments to improve the efficiency of electricity markets
after power bills almost doubled since 2008.  “Carbon price excluded, the average electricity bill went
up by at least 48 percent in the last four years,” Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  said in Sydney today, according to the e-
mailed text of her speech. “I am determined to get a plan in
place to prevent unnecessary price rises in future.”  Gillard’s Labor government, trailing in opinion polls
before elections due next year, is counting on payouts to help
overcome public opposition to the carbon price, which the
opposition is blaming for surging power bills. The government
says the so-called carbon tax will see electricity bills rise by
an average of A$3.30 ($3.49) a week per household and says
states have a duty to help keep costs down.  The growth in peak power demand and the “catch-up from
years of infrastructure underinvestment” have contributed to
the increase in electricity bills, Gillard said.  “The market for supplying energy services in Australia
needs to be more efficient,” said Gillard, who wants the states
to provide solutions at a meeting scheduled for the end of the
year.  Australia began charging more than 300 of its largest
polluters a fixed price of A$23 a metric ton for their
greenhouse gas emissions on July 1 and will move to a market-
based system in 2015. Opposition leader  Tony Abbott  is vowing to
repeal the levy if he wins office, calling it a “wrecking
ball” for the Australian economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
