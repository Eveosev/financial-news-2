Iraq ’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan
regional government signed contracts with South Korea’s Posco
Engineering & Construction Company Ltd. and Korea National Oil
Corp. to build two  power plants  for $700 million.  Posco will build the plants and KNOC will finance the
projects in line with terms of its 2008 oil-exploration
agreement with the Kurdish northern region of Iraq, according to
a statement on the regional government’s website.  The projects include the construction of a 300-megawatt
steam power-generation plant in the Erbil region within three to
six months and a 400-kilovolt power transformer in Sulaimaniya
province within eight months, according to the statement, which
