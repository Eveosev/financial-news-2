The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell less than 0.1 percent to 655.27 at 7:40 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
was also down less than 0.1 percent to 1,556.707.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil in  New York  slipped from the highest close in a
week amid signs that supplies are increasing in the U.S., the
world’s largest consumer.  Oil for September delivery traded at $93.22, down 21 cents,
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:52 a.m. London time.
It earlier dropped to $92.77. The contract advanced 70 cents
yesterday to $93.43, the highest settlement since Aug. 7. Prices
are down 6 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas  futures declined after yesterday’s rebound from
a six-week low in New York.  OIL PRODUCTS  High-sulfur fuel oil’s discount to Asian marker Dubai crude
narrowed 7 cents to $3.33 a barrel at 5:58 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The
gap shrank for a second day.  BASE METALS  Copper was seen falling in New York on concern China, the
world’s biggest consumer of the metal, will struggle to sustain
its growth pace and U.S. economic reports may weaken the case to
expand stimulus.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold is seen declining for a third day in London on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  won’t need to take more action
to stoke growth.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
