U.K. gross domestic product kept
falling in the three months through July as slack in the  economy 
widened, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
said.  GDP fell 0.2 percent from the previous three months, Niesr,
whose clients include the  Bank of England  and the U.K. Treasury,
said in an e-mailed statement in  London  today. The figures are
distorted by the additional public holiday in June for Queen
Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee, the institute said.  Data today showed British  industrial output  fell less than
estimated in June, indicating the economy may have contracted
less in the second quarter than the 0.7 percent previously
reported. Still, with demand hurt by government spending cuts
and the euro-area debt crisis, the Bank of England will probably
cut its economic outlook when it publishes new forecasts
tomorrow, according to a survey of economists.  Niesr said its estimates “suggest the U.K.’s large
negative output gap is widening” and it doesn’t expect GDP to
pass its 2008 peak until 2014.  U.K. industrial production dropped 2.5 percent from May due
to the extra public holiday for the queen’s Jubilee, the  Office
for National Statistics  said today in London. That’s smaller
than the drop estimated in the second-quarter GDP data, and the
ONS said today’s numbers may mean a 0.07 percentage point upward
revision to the GDP number.  To contact the reporter on this story:
