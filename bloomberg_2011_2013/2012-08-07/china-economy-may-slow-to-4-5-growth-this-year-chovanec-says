China’s economy  may slow to 4 percent
to 5 percent growth this year, according to Patrick 
Chovanec, an associate professor at  Tsinghua University .  “I think we are going to see a deepening of this slowdown;
this slowdown is driven by the accumulation of bad debt that’s
dragging down investment,” he said on Bloomberg Television in
Hong Kong. “We’re looking at 4 to 5 percent growth right now
despite the official numbers.”  Chovanec, an adviser and former vice president of the Hong
Kong venture capital firm Asia Mezzanine Capital Group, said
Chinese corporate earnings growth is slumping.  “Look at all the profit warnings that are coming out,” he
said.  “A lot of companies are having difficulty growing in
this Chinese economy.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
