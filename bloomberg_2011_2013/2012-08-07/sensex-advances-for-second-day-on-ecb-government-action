Indian stocks rose to the highest in
almost a month on optimism the government will take measure to
boost economic growth when parliament resumes this week, and as
Germany backed the  European Central Bank ’s bond-buying plan.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software
exporter, paced gains among peers after Cognizant Technology
Solutions Corp. raised its profit forecast and beat last
quarter’s estimates.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of luxury car
brands Jaguar and  Land Rover , rallied 4.2 percent, and  ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the largest private lender, climbed 1.9 percent.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, advanced 1
percent to 17,590.95, according to preliminary closing prices at
3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, the highest level since July 10. German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government supported the ECB’s bond-
buying plan announced last week, a spokesman said, easing
concerns the latest measures to contain the debt crisis may fail
to calm euro-area turmoil. The European Union took in 17 percent
of India’s shipments in the April-to-September period last year,
according to the commerce ministry.  Indian parliament resumes this week as the government bids
to end two years of policy gridlock to bolster economic growth
amid Europe’s crisis and elevated domestic  inflation . India’s
 economy  expanded 5.3 percent in the March quarter, the weakest
pace in almost a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
