Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka AS, the
Czech unit of  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , said its second-quarter profit
jumped 60 percent as losses on impairment of Greek bonds
from a year ago weren’t repeated.  Net income for the three months ended June 30 was 3.88
billion koruna from 2.43 billion a year ago, the Prague-based
lender said in a presentation on its website today. Net interest
income, the bank’s main source of revenue, rose 2 percent to
6.29 billion koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
