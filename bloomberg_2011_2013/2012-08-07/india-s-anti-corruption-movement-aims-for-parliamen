India Against Corruption , a powerful if flawed mass movement that put the government  under considerable pressure last August  with its demand that a long-delayed anti-corruption bill be passed, made two widely watched moves last week. They also happened to be moves in opposite directions. First, the group's talisman and moral anchor, the  septuagenarian social activist Anna Hazare , went on a fast with several other figures from the movement (often called "Team Anna") to protest the government's continued inaction on the bill. Hazare had done the same thing to tremendous effect  last August . This time, however, the response from the public, the media and the government was more muted. It seemed as if the movement's strategists -- notably the activist  Arvind Kejriwal  and the lawyer Shanti Bhushan and his son  Prashant Bhushan  -- had reached a dead end. On Aug. 3, Hazare announced that he was calling off his fast and disbanding the movement. Three days later, on Aug. 6, Team Anna announced that it had decided to switch tracks, and instead of trying to pressure an unresponsive system from without, it would try to reform it from within by forming a political party and contesting elections. In a  TV show , the retired police officer Kiran Bedi, one of the most prominent faces of the movement, said, "We have done what destiny has taken us towards." This also was the line taken by Kejriwal, who said that the movement had been guided in its decisions  by a signed petition  from 23 public figures: Great expectations indeed -- and a heavy burden for any new party entering the rough and tumble of electoral politics for the first time. Some skeptics thought that the movement had given up its core strength, that of sustained and powerful agitation on a single issue, and thereby worked itself into insignificance. After all, electoral politics aren't just about replacing the bad apples of professional politics with good ones picked from civil society, as the movement envisages, but also about ideological positions on a range of issues. There was a touching naivete about  Kiran Bedi 's claim that the agenda for the new political party wouldn't be decided "in an air-conditioned room" but rather by consensus "after going to the people." Citizens perhaps spoke, to Bedi's ear, with one voice on the issue of corruption in Indian politics -- though even here there was much disagreement on the exact form the proposed anti-corruption bill would take -- but they have a much wider range of opinions on matters of economics and social policy. It's more realistic to assume that the new party would have a pronounced left-wing stance, of the kind advanced by Kejriwal in his  recent book "Swaraj"  (Freedom). At the same time, a widening of the range of political options currently available to Indian voters is certainly to be welcomed, particularly since the two major national parties, the Congress and the BJP, demonstrate a slavish dependence on  dynastic politics  and a troubling narrow-mindedness and chauvinism respectively. Welcome, too, is the attitude that politics should be a necessary engagement for all and not just the preserve of the professional politician -- a route already taken by several new political startups in  India , such as the  Lok Satta Party  in the south. And political systems sunk deep in a morass of cynicism and corruption almost inevitably breed the kind of challenger who promises not just another alternative in politics but an alternative politics altogether -- think  Garry Kasparov  in  Russia  or  Imran Khan  in  Pakistan . Indeed, India has seen this kind of anti-corruption movement metamorphose into a political party once before, in the agitation of the  Indian intellectual Jayaprakash Narayan  in the 1970s. An editorial  in the Indian Express , a paper that was sharply critical last year of what it saw as the movement's arrogance, said: And in  Tehelka , Revati Laul wrote: And what of  Anna Hazare  himself? Even as his movement made an advance toward actual participation in politics, he spoke the language of the renunciate.  In a blog post, Hazare wrote,  "I have proposed an alternative of sending good people to Parliament. But I am not going to be part of any party nor will I contest elections."
