EON AG (EOAN) , Germany’s largest utility,
said first-half profit more than tripled after a settlement with
 OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  on supply contracts.  Underlying net income rose to 3.3 billion euros ($4.1
billion) from 900 million euros a year earlier, the Dusseldorf-
based company said today in a statement. EON also confirmed its
outlook for 2012 profit of 4.1 billion to 4.5 billion euros.  “The goals are easy to reach,” Daniel Seidenspinner, an
analyst at B. Metzler Seel Sohn & Co. KGaA, said today by phone
from  Frankfurt . About 73 percent of the underlying net income
forecast for the full year has already been achieved, he said.  EON gained as much as 3 percent, the highest since April 3,
and rose 0.7 percent to 17.73 euros by 11:22 a.m. in Frankfurt.  EON and Gazprom agreed to amend long-term supply deals last
month after the utility lost hundreds of millions of euros on
contracts linked to  oil prices . The accord was backdated to the
fourth quarter of 2010 and added about 1 billion euros to EON’s
half-year results, the utility said in a July 3 statement.  The company today also confirmed an increase in its full-
year outlook for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, initially announced after the settlement, by
800 million euros to 10.4 billion to 11 billion euros.  Ebitda rose 56 percent to about 6.7 billion euros in the
first half, “slightly” exceeding Seidenspinner’s estimate.  EON also attributed its first-half results to one-time
effects linked to Germany’s decision to phase out nuclear power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
