The zloty traded near the strongest
level in a year, fluctuating between gains and losses, as a
technical indicator signaled the rally has gone too far and an
adviser to the prime minister said the government may cut its
2013 economic growth forecast.  The zloty weakened as much as 0.2 percent and traded less
than 0.1 percent stronger at 9:42 a.m. in Warsaw after reaching
the highest level since August 2011 yesterday. It has advanced
1.9 percent this month, the third-biggest gain among more than
20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The 14-day relative strength index for the zloty rose to 71
yesterday. A reading above 70 indicates the Polish currency may
weaken, according to technical analysts. Poland’s government may
cut next year’s economic growth forecast to 1.5 percent to 2
percent from 2.9 percent due to the contraction in the euro
region,  Dariusz Filar , an economic adviser to prime minister,
said in an interview yesterday.  “The zloty is probably close to levels where we could see
corrective depreciation spurred by profit taking,” Janusz Dancewicz, chief economist at DZ Bank Polska SA, wrote in a note
to clients.  The RSI identifies possible turning points in indexes or
securities by measuring the degree that gains and losses outpace
each other in a given period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
