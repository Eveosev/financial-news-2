Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG)  investors
need to get a better idea of events leading to the trading loss
that drove the market maker to the brink of bankruptcy, said a
portfolio manager at Royce & Associates LLC, Knight’s second-
biggest shareholder.  “The first thing we need to see is a good post-mortem,”
Jay Kaplan said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Market Makers” with  Erik Schatzker  and Stephanie Ruhle. “We
do need to learn about risk controls,” Kaplan said.  Royce is a unit of Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
