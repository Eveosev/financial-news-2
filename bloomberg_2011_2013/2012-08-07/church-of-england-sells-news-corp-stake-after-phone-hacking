The Church of England sold its stake
in  News Corp. (NWSA)  saying the company controlled by  Rupert Murdoch 
hadn’t shown a commitment to corporate governance reforms after
a phone-hacking scandal.  The church sold all its News Corp. shares, worth 1.9
million pounds ($2.4 million), it said in a  statement  on its
website today. The move came after a year of talks between the
two sides regarding church-recommended governance reforms.  Following talks, the church’s ethics advisory group “does
not feel that the company has brought about sufficient change
and we have accepted its advice to disinvest,” according to the
statement.  About 60 people have been arrested in probes into bribery
and phone and computer hacking that began with New Corp.’s U.K.
publishing business, News International.  Church of England investment bodies own assets worth more
than 8 billion pounds, which helps pay for a network of 12,000
parishes, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
