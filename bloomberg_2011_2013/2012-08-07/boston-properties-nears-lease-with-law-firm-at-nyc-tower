Boston Properties Inc. (BXP)  is close to an
agreement with a second law firm to lease  office space  at 250
West 55th St., a skyscraper the real estate investment trust is
building on Manhattan’s west side.  The law firm is in talks to take about 266,000 square feet
(25,000 square meters) on the lower floors of the 1 million-
square-foot tower, Boston Properties President Doug Linde said
today. He didn’t name the company.  “This is obviously subject to signing the lease, but we’re
cautiously optimistic things are going to move in the right
direction,” Linde said on the Boston-based landlord’s second-
quarter earnings call.  Boston Properties, the biggest U.S. office REIT by stock
market value, had suspended the project in 2009. It restarted
construction last year after signing the  law firm   Morrison &
Foerster LLP  to a 180,000-square-foot lease. Morrison agreed to
take another 24,000 square feet, which would leave the building
almost 48 percent  leased , including the second deal, Linde said.
Most of the higher floors in the tower, which is at the corner
of 55th Street and Eighth Avenue, are still available.  The Commercial Observer, a newspaper that covers New York
commercial real estate, reported last week that Kaye Scholer LLP
committed to rent about 260,000 square feet in the skyscraper,
citing people it didn’t name. A call to Sandi Sonnenfeld, a
spokeswoman for the law firm, wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
