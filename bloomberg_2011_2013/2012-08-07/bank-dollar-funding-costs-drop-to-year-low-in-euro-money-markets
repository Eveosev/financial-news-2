The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars declined to the lowest in a year, according to a
money market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 36 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:30 a.m. in
London, from minus 38.5 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The cost is the cheapest since July 26, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 42 basis
points, or 0.42 percentage point, below Euribor.  The European Banking Federationâ€™s euro overnight indexed
average, or Eonia, was set at 10.9 basis points yesterday from
11.1 the day before. An estimate of overnight borrowing costs
over the next three months, the Eonia overnight indexed swap,
was 7.7 basis points from 7.6 yesterday.  Banks increased  overnight deposits  at the European Central
Bank yesterday, placing 312 billion euros ($387 billion) with
the Frankfurt-based ECB from 300 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
