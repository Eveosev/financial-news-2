Taiwan’s government bonds rallied
after the island sold 20-year debt at a record-low yield,
reflecting demand from banks for the higher returns offered by
longer-dated securities. The local dollar was little changed.  The Ministry of Finance sold NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of
the securities at 1.597 percent, with the  banking sector  buying
47.3 percent of the total, compared with 37 percent at the last
auction of the same maturity in April. Taiwan’s  consumer-price 
index rose 2.46 percent in July from a year earlier, the most
since September 2008, the Statistics Bureau said yesterday.  “Banks, including the post office, bought a lot more bonds
at this auction as they want to boost their returns,” said
George Pu, a debt trader at Sinopac Securities Corp. in Taipei.
“But the rally should be relatively short-lived. Yields should
edge higher to reflect concerns over consumer prices.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due March 2022 fell one
basis point to 1.181 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. Benchmark 10-year yields have declined 10 basis points
in 2012. The rate on the 1.5 percent securities maturing August
2032 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.599
percent.  Exports slumped 11.6 percent in July from a year earlier,
more than the 7.7 percent median estimate of 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg, according to official data released today
just before the  currency market  closed at 4 p.m. in Taipei. That
was the biggest decline since January.  The  Taiwan dollar  closed at NT$29.955 against its U.S.
counterpart, compared with NT$29.960 yesterday, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.850 yesterday, the strongest
level since July 20. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.70 percent.  The  overnight money-market rate  was steady at 0.386 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
