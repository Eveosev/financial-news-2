Danish pension industry profits fell
80 percent to 3.8 billion kroner ($633 million) in 2011 as
investment returns fell and costs rose, the Financial
Supervisory Authority said.  Investment returns declined by 30 billion kroner to 128
billion kroner amid turmulence in the financial markets, the
Copenhagen-based agency said in an e-mailed statement today.
Costs climbed 9.6 percent, it said. Total pension savings rose
by 245 billion kroner to 2.64 trillion kroner, or 1.5 times as
large as the Danish economy, the FSA said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
