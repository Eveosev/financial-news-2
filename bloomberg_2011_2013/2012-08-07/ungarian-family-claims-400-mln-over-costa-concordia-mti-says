The family of Sandor Feher, a
Hungarian who died in the wreck of the Italian cruise liner
Costa Concordia, are claiming $400 million compensation from the
ship’s operators, Hungarian state news agency  MTI  reported,
citing lawyers representing Feher’s parents.  In the claim filed in a New York court, the family accuses
 Carnival (CCL)  Plc,  Carnival (CCL)  Corp. and their Italian subsidiary, Costa
Crociere, of “serious negligence,” according to MTI.  Feher lost his life while trying to help fellow passengers
after the Costa Concordia ran aground off the Tuscan coast in
January with 4,200 passengers and crew.  To contact the reporter on this story:
