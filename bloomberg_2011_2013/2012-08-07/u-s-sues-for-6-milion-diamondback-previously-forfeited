U.S. prosecutors asked a judge for
permission to recover $6 million that Diamondback Capital
Management LLC forfeited as part of a January agreement in which
the government agreed not to prosecute the hedge fund for
 insider trading .  The U.S. government filed a civil forfeiture complaint
today in  Manhattan  federal court. Diamondback previously
transferred $6 million to the U.S. Marshals Service as part of
the non-prosecution agreement. Today’s complaint seeks to
formalize the payment.  The $6 million “represents the total amount of illegal
profits and losses avoided as a result of the trades that were
based, or likely based, in whole or in part, on inside
information,” the complaint said.  In January, Stamford, Connecticut-based Diamondback agreed
to pay a $3 million fine and forfeit $6 million in a settlement
with prosecutors and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Prosecutors agreed not to prosecute Diamondback for
the actions of former employees. Today’s complaint doesn’t name
Diamondback.  “The action is a simple formality to move funds previously
paid to U.S. Marshall to the  U.S. Treasury ,”  Steve Bruce , a
Diamondback spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “There is
nothing new here.”  The case is U.S. v. $6 million in currency, 12-cv-6023,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
