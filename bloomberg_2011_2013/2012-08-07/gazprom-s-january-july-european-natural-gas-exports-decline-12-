OAO Gazprom’s natural gas supplies to
 Europe  in the first seven months of the year fell 12 percent to
82.2 billion cubic meters, from 93.1 billion in the same period
of 2011, according to an official at the company’s export unit.  The average price for exports to Europe this summer was
about $400 per 1,000 cubic meters, said the official, who
declined to be identified due to the Moscow-based company’s
policy. The export figures for this year are preliminary.  To contact the reporters on this story:
