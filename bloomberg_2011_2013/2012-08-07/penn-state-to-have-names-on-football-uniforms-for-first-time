Pennsylvania State University’s
football team uniforms will feature players’ names on the back
this season for the first time.  Coach Bill O’Brien said the decision was made in
conjunction with players who decided to remain at the school
after it was punished by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association for trying to cover up child sexual abuse by former
assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.  Penn State  has had players, including starting running back
Silas Redd, transfer to other schools after being hit with the
NCAA penalties and O’Brien said having names on the jerseys is a
way to honor those who have stayed with the team.  “They have stuck together during tough times and I commend
them for the leadership they have shown,” O’Brien said in a
 statement  on the school’s website yesterday. “I’m deeply
committed to honoring Penn State’s traditions, while building a
bright future for our football program.”  The NCAA sanctions include a four-year bowl ban. The school
also lost 20 scholarships annually for the next four years.  Penn State’s traditional blue and white uniform will also
feature a blue ribbon to support all victims of child abuse, the
school said.  Joe Paterno  was fired after 46 years as coach for what
school trustees said was his role in the cover-up. O’Brien, the
former offensive coordinator for the  National Football League ’s
 New England Patriots , was hired in January.  The Nittany Lions began practice yesterday in preparation
for their Sept. 1  season opener  at home against Ohio University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
