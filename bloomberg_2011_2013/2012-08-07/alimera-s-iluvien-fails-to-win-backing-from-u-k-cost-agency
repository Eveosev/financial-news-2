Alimera Sciences Inc. (ALIM)  failed to win
the backing of the U.K.’s health-cost agency for its treatment
for the leading cause of blindness associated with diabetes.  Alimera “underestimated the incremental cost-
effectiveness” of Iluvien, an implant that releases a drug that
can limit vision loss or improve vision for patients with
chronic diabetic macular edema, the National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence said in a statement today.  “The independent Appraisal Committee is aware that chronic
diabetic macular edema can have a significant effect on the
physical and emotional wellbeing of people affected,” NICE
said. “Unfortunately in this case, the committee agreed that
the evidence provided could not support a positive
recommendation.”  The existing option for patients is to receive laser
therapy.  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  is currently seeking U.S. approval for
a similar drug, Lucentis, to treat diabetic macular edema. The
Food and Drug Association has twice rejected Iluvien, most
recently in November.  The draft appraisal is open to public comment, and NICE
will probably issue final guidance in November, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
