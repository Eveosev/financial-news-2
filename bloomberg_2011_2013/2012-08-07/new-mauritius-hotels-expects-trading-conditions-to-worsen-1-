New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the Indian
Ocean island nation’s biggest leisure operator by market value,
said its loss widened in the third quarter and expects trading
conditions to worsen.  The loss increased 33 percent to 177 million rupees ($6
million) in the three months through June from the previous
quarter, it said in a  statement  on the Port Louis-based Stock
Exchange of Mauritius’s website today. Revenue rose 9.7 percent
to 1.59 billion rupees, it said.  Tourist arrivals from  Europe , the country’s main market,
declined 6 percent in the six months through June, according to
Statistics Mauritius.  “With this expected deterioration in market conditions and
based on the present trend on bookings, overall results for the
current financial year are expected to be lower than those of
last year,” the company said.  New Mauritius Hotels, which trades under the Beachcomber
name, said profit declined 5.6 percent to 726.8 million rupees
for the nine months through June from a year earlier.  The  stock  was unchanged at 68 rupees by the close in  Port
