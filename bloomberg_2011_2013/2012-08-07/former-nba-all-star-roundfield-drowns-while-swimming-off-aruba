Dan Roundfield, a former All-Star for
the  Atlanta Hawks , drowned while swimming off the island of
 Aruba , the National Basketball Association team said. He was 59.  The 6-foot-8 Roundfield played 11 seasons in the NBA from
1976 to 1987, including six seasons with the Hawks. A forward
and center, he averaged 14.3 points and 9.2 rebounds over his
career, was selected to three All-Star teams and made the NBA’s
all-defensive squad five times.  Dominique Wilkins, a member of the  Basketball Hall of Fame 
who spent 11 seasons with the Hawks, said he was stunned by the
news of Roundfield’s death. Roundfield was on vacation and
swimming with his wife yesterday when they were caught in rough
water off the southern tip of the Caribbean island, the
 Associated Press  reported, citing Aruba police.  “Danny’s one of my closest friends and he was a tremendous
influence on my NBA career, on and off the court,” Wilkins said
in a statement. “He taught me how to be a professional and took
me under his wing.”  Roundfield managed to get his wife safely to some rocks,
but was swept away in the current and drowned, Aruba police
spokesman John Larmonie told the AP. Roundfield’s body was
trapped by rocks when recovered by search teams about 90 minutes
later, according to the AP.  Roundfield is survived by his wife, Bernadette, sons
Christopher and Corey, and their grandchildren, the Hawks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
