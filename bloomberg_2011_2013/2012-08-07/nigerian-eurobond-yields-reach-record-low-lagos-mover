Yields on  Nigeria ’s $500 million of
dollar bonds fell for a seventh day, reaching a record low,
after gains in crude prices and as investors favored the
nation’s lower debt burden.  Borrowing costs on Eurobonds due 2021 declined five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.2 percent as of 3:32 p.m.
in London, the lowest since their issue in January 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil, the key export of  Africa ’s biggest producer, climbed
to the highest level in more than two months in  New York  after
better-than-estimated corporate earnings bolstered optimism that
the economy will expand. Brent surpassed $110 a barrel for the
first time since May. While Nigeria’s total domestic debt rose
17 percent to $38 billion at the end of June, from a year
earlier, the burden is still light, amounting to 16.5 percent of
2011 gross domestic product, said Gregory Kronsten, the head of
economic research at FBN Capital Ltd.  The oil price is supportive and “people want something
where there’s a good external balance sheet,” Kronsten said in
a phone interview from  London  today. “There’s a shortage
value,” as they’ve only done one Eurobond offer, he said.  Nigeria’s total external debt was $6.04 billion as of June
30, according to the country’s Debt Management Office.  The naira was little changed at 161.65 a dollar in Lagos,
the commercial capital. Yields on the West African nation’s four
percent domestic debt due 2015 fell 11 basis points to 15.68
percent, according to yesterday’s prices on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website.  Ghana ’s cedi rose 0.1 percent to 1.9555 a dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
