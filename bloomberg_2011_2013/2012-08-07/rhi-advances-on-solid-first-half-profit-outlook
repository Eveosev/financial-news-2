RHI AG (RHI) , the world’s biggest maker of
fireproofing ceramics, said advanced to the highest level in
three months after reporting “strong” earnings.  Shares  rose  3.1 percent to 19.68 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Vienna, its highest close since May 3. That
extends this year’s climb to 30 percent.  Second-quarter sales rose 9 percent to 475.9 million euros
($590 million) and earnings before interest and taxes advanced
10 percent to 44.1 million euros, while net income fell 1
percent to 30.3 million euros on a 4.6 million-euro
restructuring expenses from the partial closure of a  production
line  at RHI’s Bonnybridge plant in the U.K.  “RHI reported very strong second-quarter figures,” Thomas Neuhold, an analyst at Kepler in Vienna, wrote in a note to
customers today. “The stock currently prices in a severe
recession,” he said, adding that the brokerage was keeping its
rating at buy, “given the strong figures, the optimistic
outlook and cheap valuation.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
