A higher percentage of hopefuls for
the Chartered Financial Analyst designation passed the third
level of their three-part exam in June compared with a year
earlier.  Fifty-two percent of applicants succeeded, the  CFA
Institute  said on its  website  today, up from 51 percent on the
June 2011 exam. The group said last month that 38 percent passed
Level 1 and 42 percent passed the second exam, each down 1
percentage point from a year earlier.  A record 149,954 candidates registered to take the three
CFA exams in June, seeking to gain a hiring edge amid job cuts
in the financial industry.  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  are all planning to reduce costs and staff
in investment-banking units after a slowdown in trading and
merger volume.  Candidates can take the Level 3 exam once a year in June,
like the Level 2 test, while the first exam is available in June
and December.  Applicants take the test hoping the certification can lead
to better jobs, higher salaries and a deeper understanding of
finance. The number of people who enrolled to take the exams in
June has jumped 27 percent in the last four years.  Successful charter recipients spend an average of 300 hours
preparing for each exam and typically take four years to
complete all three tests, according to the not-for-profit
institute. Candidates must have at least four years’
professional experience in the investment industry to receive
the designation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
