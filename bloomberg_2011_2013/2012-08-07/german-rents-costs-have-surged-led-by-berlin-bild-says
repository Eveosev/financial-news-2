German rents and heating costs have
surged since the start of the 1990s, led by Berlin and Baden-
Wuerttemberg,  Bild-Zeitung  reported, citing figures published by
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden.  Rents in the two states rose nine percent over the past six
years, Bild said. Since 1995, rents in all of  Germany  increased
23.5 percent on average, the newspaper said. Electricity costs
have surged 80 percent since 1991 while heating prices have
climbed as much as threefold, depending on the type of fuel,
Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
