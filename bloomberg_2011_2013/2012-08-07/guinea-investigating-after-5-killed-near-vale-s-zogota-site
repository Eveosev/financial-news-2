Five people were killed and three
others wounded in  Guinea  on Aug. 3 when gunmen attacked the
village of Zogota, where  Vale SA (VALE5)  is developing an iron-ore mine,
the Guinean Human Rights Organization said.  Guinean President  Alpha Conde  “deeply regrets the
unfortunate events” and said an investigation has been started,
according to an e-mailed statement, which didn’t give details on
the incident.  A government delegation was sent to the Brazilian embassy
to reaffirm relations between the countries, according to the
presidency’s statement.  Vale’s press office in Rio de Janeiro declined to
immediately comment when contacted today. Vale delayed the start
of its $1.26 billion Zogota project, in the country’s south, to
the second half of 2012, the company said on July 25 during an
earnings presentation.  The project, which will have a total estimated iron-ore
capacity of 15 million metric tons per year, was previously
expected to start production in the second quarter of 2012. No
reason was given for the delay.  Residents of Zogota protested against the development of
the project earlier in the week, according to the Guinean human-
rights group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
