Kenya ’s shilling climbed the most
this month as the central bank curbed  money supply  and improved
foreign exchange reserves.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 0.5 percent, the biggest gain since July 30, to 83.65
a dollar and was trading 0.4 percent up at 83.80 per dollar by
4:38 p.m., the highest level since that date, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling has gained, helped by the central bank’s
tight monetary policy stance and supported by rising foreign
exchange reserves which have grown to above the statutory four
months of import cover, giving CBK muscle to intervene in
markets when necessary,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said today
in a note to clients.  Kenya’s foreign-exchange reserves rose to $4.98 billion in
the week to Aug. 2 from $4.93 billion a week earlier, the
Central Bank of Kenya said in its weekly bulletin, e-mailed
yesterday.  Kenya’s shilling is trading within the government’s
preferred range, Finance Minister Robinson Githae told reporters
today in Nairobi.  The central bank accepted 1 billion shillings ($11.9
million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  at a weighted
average yield of 10.15 percent, an official, who asked not to be
identified in line with policy, said today. The bank did not
accept any bids for the term-auction deposits, the official said
from Nairobi.  The Tanzanian shilling weakened less than 0.1 percent to
1,573 to the dollar, while  Uganda ’s shilling gained 0.2 percent
to 2,482.50 versus the U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
