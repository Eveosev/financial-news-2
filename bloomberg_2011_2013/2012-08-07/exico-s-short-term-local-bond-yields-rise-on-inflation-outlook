Yields on  Mexico ’s shorter term peso
bonds rose for a third day amid speculation that policy makers
won’t reduce borrowing costs as inflation expectations increase.  The yield on peso-denominated debt due in December 2013
increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.64
percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 0.02 centavo to 104.43 centavos per
peso. The peso fell 0.2 percent to 13.2298 per dollar.  Mexico’s annual inflation will end 2012 at 4 percent, the
upper limit of the central bank’s target range and higher than
the previous forecast of 3.94 percent, according to the median
estimate in a survey of economists from Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex
unit released yesterday. The national statistics agency is
scheduled to release its July inflation report on Aug. 9. Policy
makers kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at 4.5 percent
on July 20.  “The idea that the  Banco de Mexico  could cut rates seems
more and more complicated,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at
 Banco Santander SA (SAN) , said by phone from Mexico City. “The annual
inflation rate isn’t going to fall below 4 percent in the coming
months.”  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 rose
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.47 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.43
centavo to 140.63 centavos per peso.  Mexico sold all 6 billion pesos ($454 million) of 28-day
Cetes and 7 billion pesos of the 91-day securities offered, the
central bank said today on its website. The country also sold
all 9 billion pesos in 182-day bills it auctioned, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
