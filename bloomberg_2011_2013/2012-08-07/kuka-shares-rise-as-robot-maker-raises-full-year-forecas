Kuka AG (KU2) ,  Europe ’s largest maker of
assembly-line robots, rose to the highest price in almost 15
months after the company increased its 2012 forecasts following
growth in second-quarter earnings.  Kuka jumped as much as 6.8 percent to 20.40 euros, the
highest intraday price since May 13, 2011, and was trading up
4.7 percent at 10:30 a.m., valuing the company at 677.8 million
euros ($841 million).  Full-year revenue will be about 1.6 billion euros, compared
with a previous forecast for 1.5 billion euros, while earnings
before interest and taxes will amount to at least 6 percent of
sales versus a 5.5 percent to 6 percent prediction, Augsburg,
Germany-based Kuka said in a statement today. Robotics and
systems units “contributed equally” to growth in sales, it
said.  “This is a good development, as margins for orders in the
general industry are higher than in the automotive industry,”
Harald Rehmet, a Stuttgart, Germany-based analyst at Landesbank
Baden-Wuerttemberg, said by phone. “The numbers are better than
expected. Kuka is performing more strongly than the German
engineering sector.”  Second-quarter Ebit adjusted for financing costs surged 74
percent to 28.6 million euros, Kuka said. Profit beat the 22.5
million-euro average of six analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 33 percent to 448.7 million euros.  The systems unit’s new orders in the quarter rose 16
percent to 305 million euros, with most contracts coming from
the car industry, Kuka said. Orders at the robotics unit
increased 14 percent to 210.3 million euros, helped by a
quarterly record of 93.3 million euros from general-industry
customers.  Kuka plans to add to its robotics factory in Augsburg, in
addition to a previously announced expansion in  China , to
“adjust capacity to strong market growth,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
