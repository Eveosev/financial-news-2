United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , the
industrial conglomerate, sold its Clipper Windpower unit to
Platinum Equity LLC, completing a divestiture announced in
March.  United Technologies, based in Hartford, Connecticut, didn’t
disclose terms of the deal in a statement today.  The company in March said it was seeking the sale of
Clipper and other units to raise $3 billion for its purchase of
aerospace parts-maker Goodrich Corp. United Technologies’ sold
its Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne unit to  GenCorp Inc. (GY)  for $550
million in July.  United Technologies bought a 49.5 percent stake in Clipper
for $206 million in December 2009 and paid $222 million to buy
the rest of the company a year later. Reduced orders left the
Carpinteria, California-based wind-turbine maker struggling to
finance operations.  “We bought into this business with the thought that there
was going to be a renewable energy mandate in this country, and
there has not been one,” United Technologies Chief Financial
Officer Greg Hayes said in March at a  New York  investor meeting.  “We went into this business thinking that the growth we’d
seen in the last five years would continue as the push for
renewables in this country accelerated,” he said, “That has
not happened.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
