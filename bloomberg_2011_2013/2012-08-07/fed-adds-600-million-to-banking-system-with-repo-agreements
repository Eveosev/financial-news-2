The  Federal Reserve  added $600
million in  reserves  to the banking system when it arranged
repurchase agreements as part of a program to test its
operational readiness.  The three-day transactions, part of a series of open-market
operations that began in 2009, don’t represent any change in
monetary policy, according to an Aug. 2 statement on the  Federal
Reserve  Bank of New York’s  website .  Treasury, mortgage-backed
and agency collateral was accepted.  In repos, the Fed buys securities from its 21 primary
dealers for a set period, raising the amount of money available
in the banking system temporarily. At maturity, the securities
are returned to the dealers, and the cash to the Fed. In a
reverse repo, the opposite occurs.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  authorized the New York
Fed in June to undertake repos and outright purchases and sales
of securities, in addition to reverse repos, to test readiness.
The repo conducted Aug. 3 was the first by the central bank
since December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
