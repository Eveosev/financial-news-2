--  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) ,  South
Africa ’s biggest food and goods wholesaler, dropped the most in
11 months after saying it expected to post earnings that were
below analysts’ estimates.  Massmart  declined  3.1 percent, the most since September 12,
to 170 rand at the close in Johannesburg.  Adjusted earnings per share in the 52 weeks through June 24
rose to as high as 5.80 rand, Massmart said in a trading
statement today, missing the 6.82 rand average estimate of 14
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings before foreign exchange
effects and costs related to  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s purchase of
a controlling interest in the South African retailer rose to as
much as 6.80 rand, the company said.  “These shares have been priced for perfection, so even if
they are good results there are risks of being knocked back at
these levels,”  Ferdi Heyneke , a trader at Afrifocus Securities
in Johannesburg, said by phone today.  Massmart shares have climbed 28 percent since Bentonville,
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, announced
June 20, 2011, it had acquired a 51 percent stake in the company
for 16.5 billion rand ($2.02 billion). Massmart trades at 35.2
times earnings, compared with the  FTSE/JSE Africa General
Retailers Index (JGENR)  which has a price-to-earnings multiple of 20.2.  Massmart will announce its audited result on Aug. 22,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
