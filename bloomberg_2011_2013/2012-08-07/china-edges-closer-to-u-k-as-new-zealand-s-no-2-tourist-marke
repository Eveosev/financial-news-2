Chinese visitors may soon become  New
Zealand ’s second-biggest spenders from abroad, overtaking
tourists from the U.K., a government report showed.  Chinese visitor spending rose 27 percent to NZ$522 million
($429 million) in the 12 months through June 30 from a year
earlier, according to government figures published today.
Spending by U.K. visitors fell 1.4 percent to NZ$568 million and
purchases by Australians were little changed at NZ$1.64 billion.  “ China  was the standout performer,” Peter Ellis, manager
of tourism research and evaluation, said in an e-mailed
 statement . “It is now just a matter of time before China
becomes our second-largest visitor market.”  China in December overtook the U.S. as the third-biggest
market by value for New Zealand’s tourism industry, which makes
up about 9 percent of the economy. The number of arrivals from
China rose by a third to 175,000.  Total tourist spending was little changed at NZ$5.64
billion even as the number of visitors rose 5 percent, today’s
report showed. Hosting the  Rugby World Cup  in September and
October cushioned the industry from declines in traditional
markets and without it spending may have dropped more than
NZ$200 million, Ellis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
