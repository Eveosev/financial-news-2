Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said new regulatory structures such as the Dodd-Frank
Act and the Basel accords are important in helping to prevent
another crisis because they give regulators a more holistic view
of the financial system.  Regulators want to “take steps to provide a warning” of
an approaching crisis, Bernanke said at the Fed in Washington
today at a town hall meeting with teachers. The overhauls also
aim “to make the system itself as resilient as possible” in a
shock, while new international capital standards give banks more
of a cushion against “significant losses,” he said.  “Greater capital, stronger rules on derivatives trading,
more liquidity” will make the system stronger, Bernanke said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
