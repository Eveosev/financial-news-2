U.S. gasoline demand fell 0.9 percent
last week as prices at the pump rose to a seven-week high,
according to data from  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 8.87 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended Aug. 3, down from 8.95 million the prior week,
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed.  Gasoline consumption in the week ended July 27 was up 1.2
percent from the seven days ended July 20. MasterCard releases
weekly data every two weeks.  The average pump price rose 5 cents in the past week to
$3.53 a gallon, following a 5-cent gain in the week ended July

Drivers are paying 4.6 percent less than a year earlier.  The highest prices were on the West Coast, where the
average rose 1 cent to $3.73 a gallon. The lowest average was on
the  Gulf Coast , where a gallon gained 2 cents to $3.34.  Fuel consumption last week was 3 percent below the year-
earlier level, the 49th straight drop in that measure. Year-to-
