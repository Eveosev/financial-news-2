Three members of the Governor’s
Council of the National Bank of Serbia resigned today, saying a
new law violates the central bank’s independence.  Council Chairman Bosko Zivkovic and members Milojko Arsic
and Zorica Mladenovic sent their letter of resignation to the
Parliament speaker in Belgrade, saying the new amended central
bank law “grossly violates basic internationally accepted
principles of the autonomy and independence of a central bank
from the government or individual interest groups.”  They stepped down after Governor Dejan Soskic resigned on
Aug. 2 and Vice Governor Bojan Markovic quit his post yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
