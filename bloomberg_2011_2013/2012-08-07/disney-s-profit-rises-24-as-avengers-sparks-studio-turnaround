Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , the world’s largest
entertainment company, posted better than expected third-quarter
profit, buoyed by the film hit “Marvel’s The Avengers.”
Revenue fell short of analysts’ estimates.  Net income jumped 24 percent to $1.83 billion, or $1.02 a
share, from $1.48 billion, or 77 cents, a year earlier, beating
the 93-cent average of 28 analysts’  estimates . Sales grew 3.9
percent to $11.1 billion, Burbank, California-based Disney said
yesterday in a  statement , missing projections of $11.3 billion.  “The bottom line was well ahead of what we were
expecting,” said  Tuna Amobi , a  Standard & Poor’s  analyst who
recommends buying the stock. “The Avengers,” with DVD and
consumer products still to come, “sets them up for a strong
finish for the year,” he said.  “The Avengers,” released in the U.S. on May 4, is the
top-grossing film of 2012 worldwide and No. 3 all time,
according to researcher  Box Office Mojo . The movie sparked a
turnaround for Disney’s studio, which had a loss in the previous
quarter because of the box-office disappointment “ John
Carter .” It also underscored the value of Disney’s 2009
purchase of Marvel Entertainment for $4.2 billion.  “It sort of avenged for the loss of ‘John Carter,’”
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Robert Iger  said yesterday
in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “It was nice to follow what
had obviously been a big disappointment with a huge success.”  Studio Profit  Disney advanced 1.4 percent to $50.49 at the close. The
stock has risen 35 percent this year, to rank fourth among the
16 stocks in the  S&P 500 Media Index. (S5MEDA)   The studio posted a profit of $313 million in the quarter
ended June 30, up from $49 million a year ago and reversing the
loss of $84 million in the prior three months. Revenue was
little changed at $1.63 billion.  “Avengers” is approaching $1.5 billion in worldwide
ticket revenue, according to Box Office Mojo.  During the quarter, Disney named former Warner Bros.
President Alan Horn as chairman of the film division, replacing
 Rich Ross , who stepped down in April. “Avengers” director Joss Whedon will write and direct a sequel, Iger said on a conference
call.  Profit at Disney’s TV networks rose 1.5 percent to $2.13
billion, while revenue gained 2.7 percent to $5.08 billion. The
ESPN cable network realized $139 million less in deferred fee
income in the quarter, compared with a year earlier.  Sales Shortfall  The shortfall in total sales was the result of the change
in deferred revenue, Amobi said.  Income at the namesake theme parks and resorts gained 21
percent to $630 million, while revenue advanced 8.5 percent to
$3.44 billion. The two divisions accounted for  87 percent  of
Disney’s  operating income  last year.  A remodeled Disney’s  California  Adventure park in Anaheim,
California, has boosted that park’s share of total Disneyland
Resort attendance to 50 percent from 25 percent before the
additions, Iger said on the call.  Attendance at Disney’s domestic parks rose 1 percent, while
per capita spending was up 8 percent due to higher ticket prices
and spending, according to Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo.  The consumer products division, another beneficiary of the
Marvel acquisition, registered a 35 percent increase in profit
to $209 million while sales gained 8.3 percent to $742 million.  Disney’s interactive unit narrowed its loss of $42 million
from $86 million, while revenue fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
