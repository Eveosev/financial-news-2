What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
lower as forecasts for rain during the next five days boost the
outlook for crop reproduction and yields in about two-thirds of
the U.S.,  Dax Wedemeyer , a commodity broker at U.S. Commodities
Inc. in  West Des Moines , Iowa, said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures may open down 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel on
speculation that a 58 percent jump in prices since June 15 will
slow demand as harvesting starts in the southern U.S., Wedemeyer
said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower as
improved yields in the northern U.S. Great Plains and Canada
increase global production amid crop losses forecast for Russia,
Ukraine and Kazakhstan, Wedemeyer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
