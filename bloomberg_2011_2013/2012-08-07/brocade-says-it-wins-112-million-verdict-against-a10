Brocade Communications Systems Inc. (BRCD) 
said it won a $112 million verdict in a patent- and copyright-
infringement trial in federal court in  San Jose , California,
against A10 Networks Inc.  Brocade sued A10 in 2010, claiming patent infringement,
trade secret misappropriation, breach of contract, among other
claims. The claims covered all of A10’s AX Series load balancing
server products, said John Noh, a spokesman for San Jose-based
Brocade, in an e-mailed statement.  Kelly LeBlanc, an A10 spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a call or e-mail yesterday after regular business hours
seeking comment on the trial. The verdict couldn’t be
immediately confirmed from court records.  “The jury made a strong statement that returned an
unambiguous verdict for patent and copyright infringement and
trade secret misappropriation covering all of A10’s AX Series
load balancing server products,” Noh said in his statement.  The case is Brocade Communications Systems Inc. v. A10
Networks Inc., 10-cv-03428, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
