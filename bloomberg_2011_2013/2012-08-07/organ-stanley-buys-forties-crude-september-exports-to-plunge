Morgan Stanley bought a  North Sea 
Forties crude cargo at the highest price in four months after a
loading program showed exports of the blend for September will
drop to the lowest in at least five years. No bids or offers
were made for Russian Urals in  Europe .  Shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk, which
make up the Dated Brent benchmark, will total 720,000 barrels a
day, the lowest level since August 2007, when Bloomberg started
compiling the data, according to shipping plans obtained by
Bloomberg News. That’s 7 percent less than 774,194 barrels a day
in August.  North Sea  Morgan Stanley bought Forties shipment F0815 for Aug. 29 to
Aug. 31 loading from Trafigura Beheer BV at 60 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent, the highest since April 5, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
trading window. That compares with a premium of 45 cents for a
trade yesterday.  Total SA failed to buy the blend for Aug. 26 to Aug. 31 at
55 cents more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was unchanged at 44 cents a
barrel more than Dated Brent, the highest since July 16, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for September settlement traded at $111.55 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $109.02 yesterday. The October contract was at
$109.93, a discount of $1.62 to September.  Exports of Forties crude for September are planned at 10
cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, five less than August,
according to a loading program.  Loadings of Alvheim crude for September will be unchanged
from this month at five cargoes of 780,000 barrels each, a
separate shipping schedule showed.  The share of Buzzard crude in the Forties blend increased
to 65 percent in the week to Aug. 5, up from 50 percent a week
earlier,  BP Plc (BP/)  said today on its website.  BP’s Unity Riser oil and natural gas facility in the U.K.
North Sea may return today after shutting on Aug. 1 for planned
maintenance, company spokesman Mark Salt said by telephone from
Aberdeen,  Scotland .  Statoil ASA (STL)  plans maintenance at its Troll A oil and
natural gas field in  Norway  in September, spokesman Ola Anders
Skauby said in an e-mail, without specifying dates.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals rose 3 cents to a premium of 43 cents a barrel to
Dated Brent in the Mediterranean, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  One cargo of 80,000 metric tons of Siberian Light crude was
added to the loading program for July from  Russia ’s Black Sea
port of Novorossiysk, two traders with knowledge of the shipping
plan said.  The shipment, owned by OAO Gazprom, was for loading on July
30 to July 31, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the information is confidential. It raised total exports
from the port last month to 3.56 million tons, including 3.16
million tons of Urals crude and 400,000 tons of Siberian Light,
according to a loading plan.  West Africa  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe rose 2 cents to $1.42 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, the highest since June 20, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
