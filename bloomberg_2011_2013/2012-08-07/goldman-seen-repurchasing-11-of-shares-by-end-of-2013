Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may buy back as much as 11 percent
of current shares outstanding by the end of 2013, according to
International Strategy & Investment Group Inc.  That target could be reached if the New York-based company
speeds the reduction of risk-weighted assets and the  Federal
Reserve  approves the repurchase program,  Edward Najarian , an
analyst at ISI, wrote in a research note today. Otherwise, ISI
estimates Goldman Sachs will buy back 6 percent of fully diluted
shares outstanding, or about 31 million shares, over the next
six quarters.  The bank is unlikely to earn a sustainable return on
tangible common equity above 10 percent between 2012 and 2014
and Goldman Sachs, therefore, is fairly valued at between 80
percent and 90 percent of tangible book value, according to the
note. The shares are likely to remain in a range of $95 to $120,
wrote Najarian, who has a hold rating on the stock.  “We don’t see tremendous upside from its current stock
price and remain wary of the challenging macro backdrop as well
as Goldman’s volatile earnings,” Najarian wrote.  Goldman Sachs climbed 1.2 percent to $103.24 in  New York 
today and has advanced 14 percent this year. The shares trade at
83 percent of tangible book value, an estimate of how much the
firm would fetch in a liquidation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
