Estonia’s inflation rate fell to its
lowest level in almost two years in July as prices for clothing
and transport eased.  Consumer prices  increased 3.6 percent from a year earlier,
the slowest since August 2010 and down from 3.9 percent in June,
the statistics office, based in the capital, Tallinn,  said  today
on its website. That matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of four analysts. Prices rose 0.2 percent from the
previous month.  Inflation in the Baltic nation will probably slow in the
next few months as fuel prices and housing costs ease, the
 Finance Ministry  said last month. Slowing price growth would
support domestic spending as the European Union’s fastest-
growing  economy  last year loses steam because of the euro area’s
debt crisis.  Clothing prices, which carry a weighting of more than 5
percent in the  consumer price index , fell 4.8 percent from the
previous month due to seasonal discounts, while transport costs,
the third biggest item in the basket with a 13 percent share,
eased 0.5 percent for a second month as fuel became less
expensive, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
