Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social, Brazil’s national development bank, is in
talks with solar manufacturers from Asia,  Europe  and the U.S. to
finance factories in the country, Valor Economico SA reported,
citing Antonio Carlos Tovar, head of the lender’s wind and
solar-energy department.  Some companies are seeking loans to build panel factories
and others are planning polysilicon plants, the main raw
material in solar cells, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said in
an article today that didn’t name any of the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
