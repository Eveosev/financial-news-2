Coffee exports from  Uganda , Africa’s
biggest exporter of the beans, in July climbed to the highest
level this season as farmers released stocks to cash in on
improved prices, the Uganda Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments reached 307,921 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags,
surpassing an earlier season’s best of 275,057 bags in June, an
official at the authority said today by e-mail from Kampala, the
capital. Exports beat an earlier forecast of 280,000 bags,
though they were 18 percent lower than 376,173 bags a year
earlier, the official said.  Robusta coffee for September deliver climbed 4.8 percent to
$2,237 a ton in London last month. Robusta beans, used in
espressos and instant drinks, account for about 85 percent of
Ugandan production, according to the authority.  The country may export as many as 3.2 million bags in the
2011-12 season that began on Oct. 1 and runs through September,
according to the authority. That compares with a forecast of 2.8
million to 2.9 million given by National Union of Coffee
Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises on May 8.  Shipments from October through July, the 10th month of the
season, dropped to 2.32 million bags, from 2.50 million bags a
year earlier, according to a tally of the authority’s figures by
Bloomberg. The nation exported 3.15 million bags worth $448.9
million in 2010-11, according to the authority.  The European Union, Sudan, the U.S., India,  Morocco ,
 Ecuador , Switzerland, Japan and  South Africa  are among the
biggest importers of Uganda’s coffee, the agency says. Uganda
consumes about 3 percent of its annual crop, according to the
Eastern Africa Fine Coffee Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
