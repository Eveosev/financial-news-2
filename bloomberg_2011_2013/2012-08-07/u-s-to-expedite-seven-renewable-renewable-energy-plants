The U.S. will expedite the approval
of seven solar and wind-energy projects in four western states
that will produce power for about 1.5 million homes.  The Office of Management and Budget will oversee “a
government-wide effort to make the permitting and review process
for infrastructure projects more efficient and effective” for
facilities in Arizona, California, Nevada and Wyoming that total
almost 5,000 megawatts, according to a statement today.  The effort is part of President  Barack Obama ’s strategy to
promote wider use of renewable energy on federal land. The U.S.
Interior Department has approved 31 utility-scale wind, solar
and geothermal projects since 2009, with more than 7,200
megawatts of capacity.  “These seven proposed solar and wind projects have great
potential to grow our nation’s energy independence, drive job
creation and power economies across the West,” Interior
Secretary Ken Salazar said in the statement.  The agency is fast-tracking the 425-megawatt Mohave Wind
Energy project and the 100-megawatt Quartzsite Solar Energy farm
in Arizona; the 150-megawatt Desert Harvest and  NextEra Energy
Inc. (NEE) ’s 750-megawatt McCoy solar sites in California; the 200-
megawatt Moapa and  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) ’s 350-megawatt Silver State
South projects in Nevada; and the 3,000-megawatt
Chokecherry/Sierra Madre wind farm in Wyoming.  Quartzsite, Desert Harvest and McCoy are expected to
receive final permitting and reviews by December, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
