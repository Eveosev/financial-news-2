Italian industrial  production 
declined more than forecast in June, signaling the euro region’s
third-biggest economy probably contracted for a fourth quarter.  Output dropped 1.4 percent from May, when it rose a revised
1 percent, national statistics office  Istat  said in Rome today.
Economists forecast a decline of 1 percent, according to the
median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Production
fell 8.2 percent from a year ago on a workday-adjusted basis.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s austerity measures have
deepened the economy’s fourth recession since 2001, with
employers’ lobby  Confindustria  predicting gross domestic product
will contract 2.4 percent this year.  Italian business confidence declined last month more than
economists forecast as executives became more concerned that the
country’s economic recession will deepen in coming months.  Fiat SpA (F)  temporarily stopped new investments in Italy as
the  European debt crisis  caused sales in the region to plunge.
Italian car sales have plummeted 20 percent through July, with
deliveries this year on track to slip to the lowest level since
1979.  Istat had originally reported a 0.8 percent increase in May
industrial production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
