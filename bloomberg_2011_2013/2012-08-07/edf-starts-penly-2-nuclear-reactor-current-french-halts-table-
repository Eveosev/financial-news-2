Electricite de France SA started its
Penly-2 nuclear power plant yesterday after an unplanned halt,
according to data on the website of grid operator Reseau de
Transport d’Electricite.  EDF plans to start its Cruas-1 and Chooz B-2 nuclear power
plants on Aug. 13, RTE data show. The company’s 1,300-megawatt
Cattenom-4 unit was scheduled to start on Aug. 5 after an
unplanned halt on May 29. The reactor was not generating at 12
p.m. Paris time, RTE data show.  EDF, the world’s biggest nuclear power plant operator, has
39 reactors online, representing 67 percent of available nuclear
capacity, RTE data show. EDF’s 58 atomic plants generate about
78 percent of the country’s power.  The following table lists EDF’s nuclear units that are out
of service, their generating capacity in megawatts, when they
