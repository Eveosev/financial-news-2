Mando Corp. (060980) , which makes brakes and
steering systems, said it may buy the South Korean National
Pension Service’s holdings in auto-parts maker  Halla Climate
Control Corp. (018880)   Mando has reached an agreement to buy all or part of the
National Pension Service’s 8.1 percent stake in Halla should the
pension fund decide to sell, the Pyeongtaek, South Korea-based
auto-parts maker said in a regulatory filing today. Financial
terms weren’t disclosed.  The preliminary accord comes two weeks after the pension
fund,  South Korea ’s largest institutional investor, blocked
 Visteon Corp. (VC) ’s plan to buy the 30 percent of Halla it doesn’t
yet own. Today’s deal means that any revival of a Visteon offer
would need Mando’s approval, said Lee Sang Hyun, a Seoul-based
analyst at  NH Investment & Securities Co. (016420)   Halla, based in Daejeon, South Korea, fell as much as 15
percent in Seoul trading after the announcement. Mando declined
as much as 2.1 percent.  The National Pension Fund stake in Halla is large enough to
block a Halla offer because Korean rules require  Van Buren
Township , Michigan-based Visteon to get approval from investors
representing 95 percent of the acquisition target’s stock to
carry out a buyout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
