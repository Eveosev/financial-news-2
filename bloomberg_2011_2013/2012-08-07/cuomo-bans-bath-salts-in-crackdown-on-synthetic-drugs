The New York State Department of
Health issued new regulations to crack down on the increasingly
widespread use of bath salts and other synthetic drugs, Governor
 Andrew Cuomo  said.  The new regulations will expand the existing list of
prohibited drugs and chemicals to include dozens more substances
that are now used to make synthetic drugs, better ensuring that
distributors can no longer skirt the law by simply modifying the
drug’s ingredients, Cuomo said today in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
