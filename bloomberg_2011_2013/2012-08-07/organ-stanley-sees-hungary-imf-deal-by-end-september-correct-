Hungary  may reach an agreement with
the International Monetary Fund by the end of September, Morgan
Stanley said, adding that there is a risk of delay in sealing
the deal.  The forint should outperform the Polish zloty as Hungary
nears an agreement, Morgan Stanley said in a report today.
Buying the Hungarian currency and selling the zloty is a trade
“we are watching,” Morgan Stanley said, adding that it does
not recommend the trade “yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
