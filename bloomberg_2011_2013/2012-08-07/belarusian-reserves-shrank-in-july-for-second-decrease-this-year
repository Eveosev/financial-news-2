Belarus’s international reserves
dropped last month for the second time this year as the country
serviced debt in foreign currencies.  The gold and foreign-currency holdings shrank 1.2 percent
in July to $8.23 billion, the central bank in the capital,
Minsk, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Belarus wants to maintain its reserves at between $6.1
billion and $7 billion until the beginning of 2013, according to
monetary-policy  guidelines  approved by the government.
Preventing the stockpile from dropping below 2011’s year-end
level will be a top priority for policy makers in the second
half of 2012, the central bank said July 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
