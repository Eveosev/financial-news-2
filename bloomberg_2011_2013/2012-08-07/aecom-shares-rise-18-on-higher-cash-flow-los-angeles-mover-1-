AECOM Technology Corp. (ACM) , an
engineering and consulting company, rose the most since it went
public after it said free  cash flow  in the third quarter was
higher than it expected.  Shares of the Los Angeles-based company advanced 18 percent
to close at $18.82 in  New York , the biggest gain since its
initial public offering in May 2007.  Free cash flow, the difference between revenue from
operations and  capital expenditures , was $186 million, compared
with $1 million a year ago, the company said today in a
statement.  “The company had a big jump in free cash flow, and
management reaffirmed its guidance for the full year, which has
been rare among the industrial names this earnings season,”
Nathaniel Gabriel, an analyst at Argus Research in New York,
said in an e-mail.  AECOM’s third-quarter profit was 63 cents a share, compared
with 62 cents a year ago. The average  estimate  of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of 64 cents a share.  The company’s free cash flow results “exceeded our
expectations” and illustrate “the progress we are making to
improve our balance of growth, profitability and liquidity,”
Michael S. Burke, AECOM’s president, said in a statement.  AECOM expects full-year profit at the low end of its May
forecast of between $2.30 and $2.45 a share, the company said in
the statement.  Shares of AECOM have declined 8.5 percent this year.  The company got about  22 percent  of its revenue from the
U.S. government in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
