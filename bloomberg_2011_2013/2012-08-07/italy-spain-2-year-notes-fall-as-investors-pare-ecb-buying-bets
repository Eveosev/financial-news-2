Italian and Spanish two-year notes
fell for the first time in five days as investors pared bets the
 European Central Bank  will be able to stem the debt crisis
through buying  government bonds .  The decline in shorter-maturity debt saw the extra  yield 
investors demand to hold  Spain ’s 10-year bonds over two-year
notes narrow from a record set yesterday. Italian lawmakers hold
a final vote on spending-reduction measures today after a
government report showed the economy shrank for a fourth
quarter. German 10-year bunds fell before a debt sale tomorrow.
Greece sold six-month bills.  “We’ve seen a bit of a reversal of the recent curve
steepening,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London , referring
to a situation where longer-maturity yields rise more than those
on shorter-dated debt. “There’s a bit of political risk in
 Italy , with a Parliamentary vote on spending cuts seen as a
possible hurdle.”  Italy’s two-year note yield climbed 15 basis points, or
0.15 percentage point, to 3.19 percent at 5 p.m. London time.
The 4.25 percent bond due July 2014 fell 0.28, or 2.80 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,242) face amount, to 101.975.  The Spanish  two-year yield  increased 36 basis points to
3.85 percent, while the 10-year yield climbed 12 basis points to
6.86 percent. The spread between the two securities shrank by 14
basis points to 312 basis points, after widening to a record 343
basis points yesterday.  Assistance Request  Yields on Italian and Spanish notes have tumbled since ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said on Aug. 2 that any bond purchases
undertaken by the bank in unison with the European Financial
Stability Facility would focus on shorter-maturity debt.  Nations will need to make a request before the central bank
or European bailout funds will buy their bonds, he said. The
European Union today said it has received no requests to
activate the program.  The German 10-year bund yield climbed nine basis points to
1.49 percent. The two-year yield rose three basis points to
minus 0.03 percent.  The country will auction 4 billion euros of 10-year
securities tomorrow.  Italy’s gross domestic product slid 0.7 percent in the
second quarter, according to a preliminary report today. The
contraction was less than the median forecast for a 0.8 percent
decline in a Bloomberg News survey. A separate report showed
German factory orders declined in June more than twice as much
as economists estimated.  Greek Sale  Greece  sold six-month bills at an average yield of 4.68
percent, compared with 4.70 percent at the previous auction of
the securities on July 10.  The yield on Greek government debt due February 2023
dropped 48 basis points to 24.60 percent. The price rose 0.56 to
19.43 percent of face value.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Finland and  Germany ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two-
year and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Portuguese 10-year bonds advanced for a ninth day, with the
yield dropping 42 basis points to 10.05 percent. The rate on
two-year notes fell 74 basis points to 5.90 percent after
touching 5.83 percent, the lowest level since March 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
