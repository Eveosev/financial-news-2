Fraser & Neave Ltd. (FNN)  received an
unsolicited bid from a family member of Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi for a stake in  Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. (APB) 
that’s 10 percent higher than  Heineken NV (HEIA) ’s offer.  The S$55-a-share bid came from Kindest Place Groups, owned
by Chotiphat Bijananda, Charoen’s son-in-law, for 18.8 million
shares or 7.3 percent of APB, Singapore-based F&N said in a
statement today. Charoen is the controlling shareholder of Thai
Beverage Pcl.  F&N’s board of directors last week recommended Heineken
NV’s offer of S$50 a share for its 40 percent stake in APB to
shareholders. Heineken already owns a 42 percent stake and said
on July 20 that it would offer as much as S$7.5 billion for the
rest.  Heineken has sought full control of Singapore-based APB as
it attempts to protect its hold over a key emerging-market asset.
 Thai Beverage (THBEV) , controlled by the billionaire, last month bid for
a 22 percent stake in F&N. The company owned by his son-in-law
also acquired about an almost 9 percent stake in APB. Brewing
assets in high-growth economies are in short supply after a
decade of consolidation in the industry.  Vichate Tantiwanich a senior vice president at Thai Bev,
said by phone that he couldn’t comment on the bid by Kindest
Place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
