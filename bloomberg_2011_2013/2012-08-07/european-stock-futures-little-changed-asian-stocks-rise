European stocks advanced for a third
day as gains by companies that reported better-than-expected
earnings offset falls by  Standard Chartered  Plc and  Nestle (NESN)  SA.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  climbed 1.6 percent and  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  added
6.7 percent after they reported earnings that beat estimates.
Standard Chartered tumbled the most in almost 24 years after a
U.S. regulator said the lender faces suspension of business
activities because of transactions with Iranian banks. Nestle
fell 1 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.8 percent to 268.80 at
the close of trading. The gauge extended a four-month high
yesterday, as Greece and its creditors agreed to strengthen
efforts to meet bailout conditions and support economic growth.
The measure has climbed 14 percent since June 1 as policy makers
eased repayment terms for Spanish banks and optimism grew that
central banks will announce stimulus measures.  “Expectations for  European (SXXP)  equities did get low,” Ben Lofthouse, a  fund manager  at  Henderson Global Investors  in
London, said in a Bloomberg television interview. “We’ve seen a
defensive rally. These companies are doing well. Their results
are proving that they are doing OK.”  National benchmark indexes rose in 14 of the 18 western
European markets. France’s CAC 40 Index rallied 1.5 percent.
Germany’s DAX added 0.7 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100
increased 0.6 percent.  Economic Reports  German factory orders declined more than twice as much as
economists forecast in June as sales to euro-area countries
slumped.  Orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation, dropped
1.7 percent from May, when they rose 0.7 percent, the Economy
Ministry in Berlin said today. Economists forecast a 0.8 percent
decline, according to the median of 35 estimates in a  Bloomberg
News survey . From a year earlier, orders fell 7.8 percent when
adjusted for work days.  Italy’s economy  contracted  for a fourth straight quarter in
the three months through June amid an intensifying euro-area
debt crisis.  Gross domestic product declined 0.7 percent in the second
quarter, Rome-based national statistics institute Istat said in
a preliminary report today. The contraction was less than the
median forecast for a 0.8 percent decline in a survey of 22
economists by Bloomberg News. GDP fell 2.5 percent from a year
earlier.  U.K. retail sales rose in July as the start of the Olympics
at the end of the month helped to boost food and drink sales,
the  British Retail Consortium  said.  Xstrata Beats  Xstrata, target of a $27 billion takeover bid by Glencore
International Plc, added 1.6 percent to 896.9 pence. The mining
company reported first-half net income of $1.94 billion, beating
the average estimate of $1.49 billion in a survey of analysts.  Danske Bank rallied 6.7 percent to 96.05 kroner. The lender
said second-quarter profit surged 27 percent to 1.5 billion
kroner ($250 million), exceeding estimates in a Bloomberg survey
by the most since the first quarter of 2010, after Denmark’s
largest lender booked higher income and cut its costs.  InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG)  increased 6.4 percent to
1,725 pence, its highest price since 2003. The world’s largest
provider of hotel rooms reported a 6 percent gain in first-half
profit and said it will return $1 billion to shareholders
through a special dividend and share buyback.  Resource Stocks  A gauge of basic resources shares advanced 2.3 percent for
the second-biggest gain among the 19 industry groups in the
Stoxx 600 as steelmakers advanced.  Voestalpine AG (VOE) , Austria’s biggest steelmaker, rallied 6.6
percent to 23.35 euros after saying full-year profit will almost
match last year’s result, even after first-quarter earnings
slumped.  Kloeckner & Co SE (KCO)  climbed 8.5 percent to 7.49 euros.
 Evraz Plc (EVR)  rallied 10 percent to 276.9 pence.  Standard Chartered (STAN)  plummeted 16 percent to 1,228.5 pence,
its biggest decline since Sept. 1988. The lender may face costs
of as much as $5.5 billion after it was accused of violating
U.S. money laundering laws relating to its dealings with Iranian
banks, according to Cormac Leech, an analyst at Liberum Capital
Ltd.  The bank conducted $250 billion of transactions with
Iranian banks over seven years in violation of federal money
laundering laws, a  New York  regulator said in an order warning
that the firm’s U.S. unit may be suspended from doing business
in the state.  Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, dropped 1 percent
to 59.70 euros.  Lanxess Slides  Lanxess AG (LXS)  slid 1.4 percent to 60.01 euros. The chemicals
company reported second-quarter earnings excluding extraordinary
items that beat analyst estimates and reaffirmed its 2012
forecast. The reiteration of its earlier guidance may disappoint
investors, according to Kepler Capital Markets.  Elan Corp. (ELN)  sank 8.7 percent to 8.43 euros, paring losses of
as much as 14 percent, after the company’s partners ended most
plans to develop an Alzheimer’s drug following a second failure
in a clinical trial. Elan will take a charge of $117.3 million
this quarter, writing down to zero the value of its venture with
Johnson & Johnson to develop the drug, bapineuzumab, the Dublin-
based company said.  Royal DSM NV (DSM) , the world’s largest maker of vitamins, fell
3.8 percent to 39.64 euros. The company said it plans to save
150 million euros ($186 million) through further cost reductions
by 2014 and plans to cut about 1,000 jobs. DSM reported second-
quarter earnings that were in-line with analyst estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
