Hot springs operators in Tsuchiyu,  a
town about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Fukushima’s
stricken nuclear station in  Japan , plan to build a geothermal
power plant as part of recovery efforts, a local group said.  The plant will have capacity of as much as 250 kilowatts
and cost 300 million yen ($3.8 million), Kazuya Ikeda,
secretary-general of the Yuyu Tsuchiyu Onsen Cooperative Union,
whose 55 members include hot springs and store operators, said
today in a phone interview. Operations at the binary plant may
start as early as December 2013, he said.  The proposed plant is part of reconstruction efforts for
local hot springs following last year’s record earthquake and
tsunami, Ikeda said. Five of the 16 hot springs operators in
Tsuchiyu closed after the disaster. Electricity from the plant
will be sold to Tohoku Electric Power Co., he said.  Capacity at the plant may be expanded to as much as 1,000
kilowatts, Ikeda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
