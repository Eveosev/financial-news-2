The U.S.  National Labor Relations
Board  will appeal a judge’s ruling that threw out changes to
union balloting rules because the agency lacked a quorum.  The board, in a notice of appeal filed today in  Washington ,
said it will ask the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Washington to
reinstate a measure that would allow for faster votes in union
elections.  U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington threw out
the board’s rule change on May 14, saying only two members
participated in the December 2011 vote approving it. On July 27,
he rejected the board’s request to reconsider the decision. The
board argued that it reached a quorum because a third member of
the five-person board had participated through an electronic
voting system.  The rule change, challenged by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, simplified and shortened balloting. The compressed
schedule could have cut the time permitted for voting in half to
as few as 15 days.  Three members of the board are required to constitute a
quorum.  The case is Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. v. National
Labor Relations Board, 11-cv-02262, U.S. District Court,
 District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
