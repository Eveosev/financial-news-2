Gold exports from  Tanzania , which
vies with  Mali  to be Africa’s third-biggest producer of the
precious metal, climbed 30 percent $2.3 billion in the year
through June, the Bank of Tanzania said.  The current account deficit, the broadest measure of trade
in goods and services, widened to $4.3 billion in the year to
June 30 from $2.3 billion in the same period a year earlier as
oil imports surged, the Dar es Salaam-based central bank said in
a report e-mailed today.  Gold shipments climbed 3 percent to 38.4 metric tons from a
year earlier, the bank said. The value of gold exports increased
“largely due to a rise in the world market price by 21.9
percent,” it said.  Sales of the metal helped increase the country’s exports
14 percent to $8 billion against imports of $13 billion. The
import bill increased 30 percent from the same period a year
earlier, according to the bank.  The external debt of East Africa’s second-biggest economy,
after Kenya, stood at $10.3 billion at the end of June, up $386
million from the previous month. The country’s foreign-exchange
reserves were $3.8 billion, sufficient to cover four months of
imports, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
