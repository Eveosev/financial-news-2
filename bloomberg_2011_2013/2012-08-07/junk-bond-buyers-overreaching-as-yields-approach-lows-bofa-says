Bank of America Corp.  warned
investors not to overreach in the junk-bond market as company
inventory costs outpace revenue growth, threatening to end a
rally that has pushed yields to almost record lows.  Revenue growth for the more than 200 high-yield, high-risk
issuers that have reported their second-quarter results was 1.5
percent, compared with a rise in inventory costs of 2.2 percent,
Bank of America credit strategists led by Hans Mikkelsen and
Oleg Melentyev in  New York  wrote in an Aug. 6 report.  “This is not a sustainable state of affairs, and we would
expect to see further steps in addressing cost structures going
forward, meaning further cutbacks in payrolls, new orders” and
 capital expenditures  during the three months that will end Sept.
30, the analysts wrote. “While the bid for high-quality yield
is understandable in this environment, we question the extension
of this reach into the economically and risk appetite-sensitive
portions of the credit spectrum.”  The so-called yield-to-worst for U.S.  junk bonds  are 20
basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, above the record low
average of 6.7 percent, the strategists for the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based bank said. The measure, which takes into account
the risk that bonds will be redeemed early, leaves little
opportunity for price gains, they said.  Junk bonds, rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service
and lower than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s , have returned 9.7
percent this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
U.S. High Yield Master II Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
