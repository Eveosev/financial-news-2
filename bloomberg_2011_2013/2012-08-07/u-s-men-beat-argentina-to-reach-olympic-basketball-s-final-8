The U.S. beat Argentina 126-97 to
advance to the elimination stage of the Olympic men’s basketball
competition with a 5-0 record.  Kevin Durant  of the National Basketball Association’s
Oklahoma City Thunder led the U.S. with 28 points and hit 8-of-
10 three-point shots, while  LeBron James  of the  Miami Heat  added
18 points.  The defending Olympic champions held a 60-59 halftime lead
before outscoring Argentina 42-17 in the third quarter to pull
away for the victory in London. The U.S. and Argentina are among
eight teams to reach the tournament’s knockout stage.  “In the first half they ran their offense to a tee,” U.S.
guard  Chris Paul , who had 17 points and seven assists, told
reporters. “We came out and played a much better third quarter
and second half. They made us compete.”  The Americans, who two days ago trailed in the fourth
quarter before beating Lithuania 99-94, won their five group-
stage games by an average of 38.2 points, outscoring their
opponents by 191 points.  Argentina, which was led by 16 points from  Manu Ginobili  of
the NBA’s San Antonio Spurs, had a 3-2 record in group play.  The U.S. plays Australia (3-2) in tomorrow’s quarterfinals,
while Argentina, which took the bronze medal at the Beijing
Games four years ago, faces archrival Brazil (4-1).  The U.S. and Argentina would meet again in the semifinals
if they both win.  Spain (3-2), which lost to the U.S. in the 2008 gold medal
game, plays France (4-1) in its quarterfinal game tomorrow,
while Russia (4-1) meets Lithuania (2-3) for a semifinal spot.  The U.S. team has won 13 gold medals in the 16 Olympic
tournaments they’ve entered. They last lost an Olympic game in
2004, when Argentina beat them 89-81 to win the gold medal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
