Dubai’s benchmark  stock index  fell
for a second day on investor speculation a rally last week
prompted by earnings that exceeded expectations was overdone.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , which last week surged 5.2 percent,
dropped the most since July 23.  Dubai Financial Market PJSC (DFM) , the
only publicly traded Gulf Arab stock market, declined for a
second day. The DFM General Index fell 0.2 percent to 1,556.79,
the lowest level since Aug. 2, at the close in the emirate. The
measure rallied 2.7 percent last week. The  Bloomberg GCC 200
Index (BGCC200)  gained 0.1 percent and Qatar’s QE Index rose 0.2 percent.  “The market is experiencing some slight profit-taking on
selected stocks” after the rally last week, said Samer Darwiche, a Dubai-based analyst at Gulfmena Investments Ltd.  United Arab Emirates companies including Emaar, which has
the heaviest weighting on Dubai’s index, posted second-quarter
profit that beat estimates. The earnings helped push Dubai
benchmark’s  14-day relative strength index  to 70 on Aug. 5, a
level that to some investors indicates a measure is poised to
decrease. The index declined to 62 today.  Oil for September delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent to
$91.78 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  before
trading at $92.65 a barrel at 5:05 p.m. in Dubai. Gulf Arab oil
exporters, including Qatar and the U.A.E., supply about a fifth
of the world’s oil.  ‘Surprise Positively’  The shares of Emaar, the developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, fell 1.2 percent to 3.38 dirhams, trimming the gain
for the year to 32 percent. Dubai Financial Market decreased to
98.2 fils, the lowest since July 31.  Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI)  climbed to the highest since April 17,
rising 0.8 percent to 65.1 fils, after the Middle East’s biggest
discount airline reported a 31 percent increase in second-
quarter profit, beating estimates.  “Company earnings are continuing to support and surprise
positively like Air Arabia,” Darwiche said.  Saudi Arabia (SABIC) ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.3 percent
and  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.2 percent. Oman’s  MSM
30 Index (MSM30)  and Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  were little changed,
while  Kuwait (KWSEIDX) ’s gauge slipped 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
