China overtook  South Africa  as the
largest ferrochrome producer this year, according to  Merafe
Resources Ltd. (MRF) , which has a joint venture with  Xstrata Plc. (XTA)   China accounted for 33 percent of the 4.8 million metric
tons produced in the first half, while South Africa produced 32
percent, Johannesburg-based Merafe said today in a statement,
citing data compiled by Heinz H. Pariser Alloy Metals & Steel
Market Research.  South Africa’s market share fell as Eskom Holdings SOC
Ltd., supplier of about 95 percent of the country’s power, took
back electricity allocated to ferrochrome producers in return
for payments to prevent a repeat of 2008 rolling blackouts.  South Africa shipped about 2.1 million tons of chrome ore
to Chinese ferrochrome production plants in the first half,
Merafe said, citing Chinese customs data.  China  is the world’s
largest producer of stainless steel, made with ferrochrome.  Merafe has proposed a $100 a ton levy on unprocessed
chrome-ore exports from South Africa to halt the trend. Talks
with the government have advanced, Merafe said today.  The Xstrata-Merafe venture idled seven of its furnaces from
February to May, prompting a 130,000-ton production loss, Merafe
said in a copy of a presentation posted on its website. The
effect of Eskom’s payment was “net positive,” it said.  Merafe owns 20.5 percent and Xstrata the rest of the South
African venture that produces about 16 percent of the world’s
ferrochrome, according to Merafe’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
