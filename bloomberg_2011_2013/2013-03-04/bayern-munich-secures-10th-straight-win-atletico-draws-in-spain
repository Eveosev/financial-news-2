Bayern Munich  extended its winning
run to 10 matches to maintain a 17-point advantage atop German
soccer’s Bundesliga.  Atletico Madrid  missed a chance to cut
Barcelona’s lead in Spain down to single figures.  Mario Gomez ’s 39th-minute goal clinched a 1-0 win at
Hoffenheim yesterday, giving Bayern its 20th victory from 24
league games and 63 points atop the standings. Defending
champion Borussia Dortmund is second with 46 points after a 3-1
win over Hanover two days ago.  Bayer Leverkusen , a 2-1 winner
against Stuttgart, is a point further back.  “We ground out the win,” Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes said
in comments on his club’s website. “It wasn’t brilliant, we
didn’t sparkle, but three points are on offer for that too.”  Bayern is still in contention to secure three trophies this
season after knocking Dortmund out of the German Cup last week.
The Bavarian club, which leads Arsenal 3-1 after their Champions
League round-of-16 opener, was yesterday drawn to host Wolfsburg
in the semifinals on April 16 or 17.  In Italy,  Inter Milan  came back from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at
Catania yesterday. Ricky Alvarez got Inter’s first goal and
substitute Rodrigo Palacio added two more, the winner coming in
stoppage time. Inter moved even with Lazio on 47 points.  Serie A leader Juventus, which drew 1-1 at Napoli three
days ago, has 59 points. Second-place Napoli has 53 and AC Milan
is on 48 after a 3-0 win against Lazio.  Missed Opportunity  In the Spanish league, second-place Atletico Madrid failed
to take full advantage of Barcelona’s defeat at Real Madrid a
day earlier by drawing 0-0 at Malaga. Two days ago, Real beat
Barca for the second time in five days as  Sergio Ramos ’s late
goal secured a 2-1 victory.  Barcelona has 68 points, Atletico Madrid 57 and Real Madrid
55. Real visits  Manchester United  tomorrow in the second game of
their Champions League round-of-16 matchup. The first match
ended 1-1.  Lyon missed the chance to go level on points with leader
Paris Saint-Germain in France by drawing 1-1 at Brest yesterday.  Brest took a ninth-minute lead through Kamel Chafni. A
54th-minute own goal by Tripy Makonda tied the scores.  PSG lost 1-0 at Reims two days ago even though its opponent
played the last half-hour with 10 men after Christopher Glombard
was red-carded. Grzegorz Krychowiak got the 64th-minute goal and
 David Beckham ’s introduction as a PSG substitute couldn’t turn
the match around for his team.  PSG has 54 points, with Lyon on 52 and Marseille on 49
after a 2-1 win against Troyes.  In the Netherlands, Feyenoord moved to third with 50 points
after a 3-0 win at NEC Nijmegen yesterday. PSV Eindhoven leads
with 53 points following a 2-0 victory over VVV Venlo and Ajax
is on 51 after winning 2-0 at  FC Twente .  To contact the reporter on this story:
