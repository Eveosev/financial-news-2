HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  Chief Executive
Officer  Stuart Gulliver  received a 1.95 million-pound ($2.9
million) bonus for 2012 even after the British lender paid a
record fine for breaking anti-money laundering rules.  The award, down from 2.2 million pounds in 2011, reduced
Gulliver’s total compensation to 7.4 million pounds, from 8
million pounds a year earlier, HSBC said in its annual report
published  today . The London-based bank paid staff 3.7 billion
pounds in bonuses for last year, a 7 percent drop from 2011.  Europe ’s largest bank by market value today reported a
decline in annual profit and said costs rose for a third year,
missing its target. The bank’s reputation was “crushed” after
it agreed to pay $1.92 billion to settle U.S. probes of  money
laundering  in places such as  Mexico , Gulliver said on Feb. 6.  Some 60 percent of Gulliver’s award is deferred for five
years and is subject to the “successful completion” of the
prosecution agreement with U.S. regulators, according to HSBC.
The bank said it had clawed back an undisclosed amount from
bonuses paid in previous years.  HSBC paid 204 employees more than 1 million pounds last
year, up from 192 employees in 2011.  In a deferred prosecution agreement, the government allows
a target to avoid charges by meeting certain conditions such as
the payment of fines or penalties and by committing to specific
reforms, either under the guidance of a monitor, or the creation
of an internal compliance panel.  Pretax earnings for 2012 fell to $20.65 billion from $21.87
billion a year earlier, trailing the $23.49 billion estimate of
26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue fell 5.4 percent to
$68.33 billion, the bank said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
