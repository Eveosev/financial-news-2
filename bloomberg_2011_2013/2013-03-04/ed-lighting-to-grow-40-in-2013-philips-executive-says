Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA) ’s light-emitting diodes business will grow about 40 percent this year, Greg Sebasky, chief executive officer of it North America unit, said today in an interview.  The company sees a “growth tipping point” with the debut this year of its 60-watt equivalent LED light bulb that will retail for about $10, Sebasky said. That will help the energy- efficient technology make up about 50 percent of Philips’ lighting sales by 2015, up from 25 percent last year, he said.  “People are starting to see lighting as a durable good,” Sebasky said, taking lighting products with them when they move. The company is making  controllable , LED-driven lighting products that the company expects can save the average homeowner about $250 in electricity costs each year.  The unit of the Dutch electronics company Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV generates about $9 billion in annual sales in the U.S.,  Canada  and  Mexico .
