U.K. natural gas for within-day
delivery jumped to the highest level since March 2006 as  Norway 
cut supplies following a power failure at its Ormen Lange gas
field,  Europe ’s third-largest.  The contract climbed as much as 64 percent, the biggest
gain since January 2010, according to broker data from Marex
Spectron Group Ltd. on Bloomberg. Production from  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Nyhamna gas processing plant in northern Norway,
which handles fuel from Ormen Lange, is reduced by 53 million
cubic meters a day today and 37 million tomorrow after storms
caused a failure in the national power grid, according to Gassco
AS. Output was cut by 57 million yesterday and 32 million on
March 2, it said.  “The timing and extent of these offshore outages has
unsettled a lot of people,” Craig Lowrey, a consultant at The
Utilities Exchange Ltd. in Ipswich,  England , said today by
telephone. “It highlights the nervousness of traders that we
have seen this response.”  The reaction in U.K. prices, the benchmark for Europe’s 800
billion-euro ($1 trillion) gas market, demonstrates Britain’s
record reliance on Norwegian pipeline supplies after liquefied
natural gas shipments slumped 53 percent in the five months
through February from a year earlier, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Same-day gas  rose to 115 pence a therm, the most since
March 13, 2006, when it reached a record 255 pence a therm, and
was at 96 pence at 3:36 p.m. London time, Spectron data show.
Day-ahead gas added as much as 25 percent to 89 pence a therm
before trading at 78 pence.  Storage Drops  The  next-month  contract advanced 0.4 percent to 67.8 pence
a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.21 per million British thermal
units and compares with $3.49 per million Btu of front-month
U.S. gas.  Flows from Norway, the U.K.’s biggest source of imported
gas, were at 65 million cubic meters a day after dropping to 34
million yesterday, compared with a 30-day average of 108
million, Gassco data show. Norway was the source of a record 48
percent of U.K. gas on Dec. 26, according to Gassco and National
Grid Plc data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories at Rough, the U.K.’s largest gas-storage
facility, were at 6,909 megawatt-hours yesterday, the lowest
level for the time of year since at least 2004,  National Grid
Plc (NG/)  data show.  The  delivery network  will contain 356 million cubic meters
of gas at 6 a.m. tomorrow, little changed from 24 hours earlier,
National Grid data show. It predicted earlier that closing
linepack would be as low as 286 million.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow is predicted at
305 million cubic meters, grid data show. Total flows were at
315 million cubic meters a day versus a 30-day average of 336
million after earlier dropping to 269 million.  Gas accounted for 30 percent of U.K. power production at
3:45 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 47 percent, nuclear 15
percent and wind 1.6 percent.  Electricity for the next working day surged 26 percent to
65 pounds a megawatt-hour, the highest since February 2012,
broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
