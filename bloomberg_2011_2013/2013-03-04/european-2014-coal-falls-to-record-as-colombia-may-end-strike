European coal for next year fell to
a record after unions and management at  Colombia ’s largest mine
reached an agreement that may end a monthlong strike and
increase exports from the South American country.  Thermal coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp dropped as much as 70 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$96.40 a metric ton, the lowest level since the contract began
trading in January 2010, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. It traded at $96.55 a ton at 1:45 p.m. London time.
Coal for delivery in April dropped 2.6 percent to $87 a ton, its
lowest price since the start of trading in January.  The agreement may end a strike at the Cerrejon mine in
about a week, Luz Maria Tobon, a spokeswoman for the
Sintracarbon union, said in a phone interview today. Drummond
Co., Colombia’s second-biggest producer, may resume exports of
80,000 of the fuel a day, after a local agency on March 1 lifted
a coal-loading ban imposed after an incident in which the
company dumped material to prevent a barge from sinking.  Supply disruptions in Colombia have affected 84 percent of
the country’s thermal coal exports, according to Michael Hsueh,
a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. The country exported
79.4 million tons of coal last year, of which 55 percent went to
European Union countries, the analyst said in a report last
month.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
