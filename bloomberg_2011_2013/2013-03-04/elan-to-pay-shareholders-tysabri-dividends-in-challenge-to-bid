Elan Corp. (ELN)  said it will pay
shareholders dividends from its royalties from  multiple-
sclerosis drug  Tysabri in a challenge to a $6.5 billion bid from
RP Management LLC for the Dublin-based drugmaker.  Biogen Idec  Inc. on Feb. 6 agreed to buy Elan’s stake in
the Tysabri drug for $3.25 billion in cash plus future
royalties. The drug generated $1.6 billion in sales in 2012.
Elan said today it will pay shareholders dividends directly
linked to Tysabri’s market performance as a 20 percent share of
the royalty received from Biogen Idec.  RP Management offered to buy Elan on Feb. 25, saying a sale
would allow shareholders to avoid the substantial risks of Chief
Executive Officer Kelly Martin’s plan to make purchases with the
proceeds from Tysabri.  Martin said today that together with a $1 billion share-
repurchase program announced Feb. 22 and plans to buy additional
drug assets, the dividend provides shareholders “significant
near- and longer-term benefits.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
