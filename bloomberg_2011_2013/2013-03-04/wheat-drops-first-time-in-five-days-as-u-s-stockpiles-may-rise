Wheat declined for the first time in
five days after a survey showed reserves in the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter, will be larger than a government
forecast. Soybeans gained.  The contract for May delivery lost as much as 0.5 percent
to $7.17 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$7.185 by 11:31 a.m. in  Singapore . Futures gained 2.2 percent in
the past four sessions as spot prices increased their discount
to corn and importers boosted  purchases  of U.S. supplies.  U.S. inventories before the 2013 harvest will probably be
702 million bushels, compared with 691 million forecast last
month by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of 30 analysts. Soy inventories in the U.S.
may be smaller than the February outlook, the survey showed.  “Prices are driven by expectation that inventories in the
U.S. will increase,” Joyce Liu, investment analyst at Phillip
Futures Pte., said by phone from Singapore. “Improving
prospects for the winter crop also eased concerns over supply.”  Futures dropped on Feb. 26 to their lowest level in eight
months as a storm system eased drought conditions in the U.S.
Wheat conditions in  Kansas  improved in February because of snow,
the USDA said on Feb. 25.  Soybean futures for May delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$14.51 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn futures for
May delivery were little changed at $7.095 a bushel, after
climbing 3.5 percent last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
