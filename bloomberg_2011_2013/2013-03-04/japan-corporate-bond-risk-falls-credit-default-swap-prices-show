The cost of insuring Japanese
corporate bonds from non-payment fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index decreased 2 basis points to
121 basis points as of 9:24 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index is on track for its lowest close since Feb. 14,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 109 basis points
as of 8:22 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge rose 1.1 basis point in the five days to
March 1, its first weekly increase in a month, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 115.5 as of 11:24 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The index rose 5.8 basis points last week, its
biggest one-week increase since November, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
