Amlin Plc (AML) , the biggest Lloyd’s of
London insurer by market value, returned to profit in 2012 as
catastrophe claims fell.  Pretax profit was 264.2 million pounds ($397 million) in
2012 after a loss of 193.8 million pounds a year earlier, the
London-based insurer said today in a statement. That missed the
277 million-pound average  estimate  of 17 analysts, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “In 2012, Amlin returned to robust profitability and
generated a strong return on equity,” Chief Executive Officer
Charles Philipps said in the statement. “Recent growth is
building earnings momentum and with profits from our non-
catastrophe businesses improving, we are well positioned to
continue to expand into more favorable market conditions.”  The insurer returned to profit after catastrophe claims
fell even after  Hurricane Sandy , which struck  New York  and  New
Jersey  in October. The firm paid 141.6 million pounds for Sandy,
which was part of large catastrophe claims totaling 152.3
million pounds last year, down from 501 million pounds in 2011.  The company said it also benefited from “a strong overall
underwriting result,” helped by improving trading conditions
such as for catastrophe reinsurance.  Total income climbed to 2.14 billion pounds in 2012,
compared with 1.98 billion pounds the previous year, the company
said. It plans to pay a full-year dividend of 24 pence a share,
up from 23 pence a share.  “In 2012, the group delivered a strong financial
performance despite the losses incurred from Hurricane Sandy and
a challenging economic environment,” Philipps said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
