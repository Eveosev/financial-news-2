The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  has
reached a “pivotal” level and must close above 291 if the
benchmark gauge is to extend its longest winning streak of
monthly gains since 1997, according to Whitman Howard Ltd.  The Stoxx 600 was bound last week by a “narrow zone of key
resistance” between 289.5 to 291 and closed little changed for
the period. The gauge fell for a second day today, losing 0.2
percent to 288.52 at 3:07 p.m. in  London .  “Investors have essentially reached decision time,” Geoff Wilkinson, a technical analyst at Whitman Howard in London,
wrote in a report to clients. “Upside progress for European
equities remains entirely dependent on closing above these key
levels. We currently remain firmly in the sell zone here from a
vanilla risk-reward perspective.”  The Stoxx 600 has climbed for nine consecutive months
through February bolstered by European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi ’s pledge to save the euro and as U.S. lawmakers
reached a budget compromise on Jan. 1. The measure has climbed
3.2 percent so far this year, reaching a 23-month high of 290.3
on Jan. 29.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of prices and volume to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
