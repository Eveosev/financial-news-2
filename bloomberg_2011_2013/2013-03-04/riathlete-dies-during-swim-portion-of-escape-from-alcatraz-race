A 46-year-old man from Austin,
 Texas , died of a heart attack during the swim portion of the
Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon in San Francisco, the first
fatality in the event’s 33-year history.  Race organizers said the competitor, who wasn’t identified,
suffered a “massive cardiac event” yesterday morning as he
started the 1 1/2-mile (2.4-kilometer) swim in  San Francisco Bay 
off Alcatraz Island. The water temperature was approximately 51
degrees Fahrenheit (10.5 Celsius).  “Safety is always our top priority in a race like this,”
Race director Bill Burke said in an e-mailed statement. “Water
safety noticed him immediately and initiated CPR while he was in
the water and as they transferred him to land.”  More than 2,000 amateur and professional athletes ranging
in age from 13 to 80 competed in the triathlon, which featured a
18-mile bike ride and an 8-mile run through  San Francisco 
following the swim in the choppy currents off Alcatraz Island.  The race was  won  by  Spain ’s Javier Gomez, who captured a
silver medal in triathlon at the 2012 London Olympics, while
Heather Jackson of the U.S. won the women’s division.  Yesterday’s death was the latest in the sport and came less
than seven months after a 43-year-old man died during New York’s
first Ironman-length race. In 2011, two competitors died during
the swim portion of the Olympic-distance New York City
triathlon.  USA Triathlon in October 2012 released a  study  that found
30 of 43 athlete fatalities that occurred in triathlons from
2003 through 2011 happened during the swim portion of the race.
The study found most triathlon-related deaths were caused by
sudden cardiac incidents and that course conditions didn’t play
a role.  To contact the reporter on this story:
