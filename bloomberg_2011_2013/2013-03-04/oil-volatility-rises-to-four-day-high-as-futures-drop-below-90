Crude options volatility rose to a
four-day high as oil futures touched below $90 a barrel for the
first time this year on concern  China â€™s growth is slowing.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 23.07 percent at 3:50 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 21.19 percent on March 1.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery declined
56 cents to $90.12 a barrel, the lowest settlement since Dec.
24, as  service industries  in China expanded at the weakest pace
in five months. Prices touched $89.33.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
April $85 puts, which rose 1 cent to 26 cents a barrel on volume
of 3,452 contracts at 3:26 p.m. in  New York . April $88 puts were
the second-most active with 2,693 lots. They advanced 8 cents to
74 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 58 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the previous session, bearish bets made up 53 percent of the
165,684 contracts traded.  May $90 puts were the most active options traded March 1,
with 7,224 contracts changing hands. They were up 43 cents to
$2.42 a barrel. April $80 puts rose 2 cents to 5 cents on 7,104
lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
35,945 contracts. Next were April $110 calls at 34,207 and June
$90 puts at 32,160.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
