The next pope must have zero
tolerance for priests who sexually abuse children, a scandal
that’s left a “wound on the body of the church,” U.S. Cardinal
Francis George said.  Catholic cardinals met at the Vatican today as they prepare
to set a date for the secret conclave to choose a successor to
 Pope Benedict XVI , who resigned Feb. 28. The issue of sexual
abuse by priests will be on their minds during the conclave,
George said at a press conference in Rome today.  “It’s certainly in the minds and hearts of many of us
because we have victims now, and they are not just victims of
sexual abuse by teachers or politician or fathers or uncles, but
they have been abused by Catholic priests, sometimes by Catholic
bishops and sometimes the abuse has not been addressed,” said
George, the archbishop of  Chicago .  U.S. cardinals were instrumental in pushing the church to
change its universal code to include zero tolerance for priests
who abuse children, he said.  “Whoever is elected pope, he governs by law not, by whim
or desire,” George said. “So he obviously has to accept the
universal code of the church, which is zero tolerance for anyone
who has ever abused a minor child and therefore may not remain
in public ministry in the church. That has to be accepted.”  George, who’s participating in his second conclave after
Benedict’s election in 2005, said abuse cases are “a terrible
wound on the body of the church and it has to be looked at.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
