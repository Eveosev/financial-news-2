Philippine government bonds dropped,
with the three-year yield rising by the most in a month, before
data forecast to show inflation is accelerating. The peso fell.  Consumer prices rose 3.3 percent in February from a year
earlier, compared with a 3 percent increase in January,
according to the median estimate of 16 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before an official report due tomorrow. That would be
the fastest pace since September. Slightly more than $85 billion
in U.S. government spending cuts began March 1 amid a more than
two-year-old impasse over raising taxes and cutting entitlements.  “Expectations of higher inflation is driving up yields in
the short term,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at Societe
Generale SA in Hong Kong. “The sequester issue is reducing
demand for the peso, which also played a role in driving up
yields.”  The yield on the 9.125 percent bonds due September 2016
advanced five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.1
percent as of 4:23 p.m. in  Manila , according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services. That was the biggest increase
since Feb. 1.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 40.775 per dollar, according
to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency touched 40.823,
the weakest level since Jan. 29. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, increased three basis points to 3.99 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
