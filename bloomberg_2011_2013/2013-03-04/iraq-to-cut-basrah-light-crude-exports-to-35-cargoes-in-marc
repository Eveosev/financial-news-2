Iraq will ship 35 cargoes of Basrah
Light crude from the Persian Gulf in March, six less than last
month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  About 59.7 million barrels of the blend will be exported
from the Basrah Oil Terminal, according to the plan. That
equates to 1.93 million barrels a day this month and compares
with average daily shipments in February of 2.34 million
barrels.  The schedule comprises 24 lots of 2 million barrels each,
five shipments of 1 million barrels, and one each of 1.97
million barrels, 1.2 million barrels, 1.11 million barrels,
889,000 barrels, 800,000 barrels and 715,000 barrels.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
