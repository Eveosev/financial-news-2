Petroleos Mexicanos Chief Executive
Officer Emilio Lozoya found “serious” and “worrisome”
corruption within the state-owned oil producer after taking the
helm three months ago, according to newspaper El Universal.  Lozoya opened a probe after becoming CEO on Dec. 3 that
found elements of corruption, the Mexico City-based newspaper
reported.  Pemex would benefit from an overhaul of the nation’s energy
laws and has too much bureaucracy and too many workers given
current production levels, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
