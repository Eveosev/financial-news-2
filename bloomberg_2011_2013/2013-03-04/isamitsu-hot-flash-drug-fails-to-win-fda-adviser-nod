Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical Co. (4530) ’s
experimental drug for hot flashes associated with menopause
failed to win the support of U.S. regulatory advisers as an
alternative to hormonal therapy.  The benefits of the medicine, paroxetine mesylate, in
helping women avoid sudden sweating and feverish feelings linked
to menopause don’t outweigh its risks of side effects such as
suicidal thoughts, advisers to the Food and Drug Administration
voted today. Earlier they voted against approval of another
medicine for hot flashes,  Depomed Inc. (DEPO) ’s gabapentin.  Paroxetine mesylate is currently sold in the U.S. by
Hisamitsu’s Noven Pharmaceuticals unit as Pexeva for depression,
panic disorder and other conditions. Saga, Japan-based Hisamitsu
bought Noven in 2009.  The FDA doesn’t have to follow its advisers’
recommendations. The agency is scheduled to decide on Newark,
California-based Depomed’s drug by May 31 and Hisamitsu’s
product by June 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
