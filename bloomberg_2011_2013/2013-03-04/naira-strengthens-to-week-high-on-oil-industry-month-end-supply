Nigeria’s naira gained for a second
day, advancing to its strongest in a week as oil companies sold
dollars to meet month-end local expenses.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer appreciated
0.4 percent to 157.35 per dollar, the strongest intraday level
since Feb. 25, as of 11:21 a.m. in Lagos, the commercial
capital.  Oil-producing companies, which sell dollars to meet local
expenses around the month-end, are the second-biggest source of
foreign currency after the Central Bank of Nigeria, which sells
dollars at auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays to help manage the
exchange rate.  The appreciation of the naira is “due to end-of-month
dollar sales by international oil companies which increased the
supply of the greenback at the interbank market,” analysts at
Lagos-based Greenwich Trust Group Ltd. led by Oladipupo Adekanmbi wrote today in e-mailed note to clients.  The central bank held the benchmark interest rate at a
record high 12 percent for an eighth straight time on Jan. 21 to
control inflation and stabilize the naira. The nation’s
inflation rate fell to 9 percent in January from 12 percent in
December, the statistics bureau said Feb. 18.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose two basis points to 10.62 percent, according
to March 1 data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell seven basis points to 4.266 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi was unchanged at 1.9175 per dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
