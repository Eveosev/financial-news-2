Gasoline futures declined as U.S.
refiners wrapped up seasonal maintenance and prepared to restart
plants. Crack spreads narrowed.  Futures fell as much as 0.9 percent, the first drop in
three days. The April  crack spread , or premium for gasoline over
West Texas Intermediate crude, slipped 73 cents to $39.99 a
barrel. The  spread  versus Brent oil on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange shrank 98 cents to $20.02.  “Prices have already plunged from their highs,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“Refineries are completing their turnarounds over next several
weeks in the U.S. and will be increasing supplies.”  April-delivery gasoline declined 1.95 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.1091 a gallon at 10:03 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  on volume that was 32 percent above the 100-
day average for the time of day. April’s premium over the May
contract narrowed to 3.4 cents from 4 cents on March 1. Supplies
may increase as plants boost production.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.5 cent to
$3.746 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. It was the fifth
consecutive decline, the longest retreat since Jan. 16. Prices,
which have climbed 14 percent this year, are 1.8 cents below a
year earlier.  Heating oil for March delivery fell 0.5 cent to $2.9251 a
gallon on volume that was 11 percent below the 100-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
