India’s rupee fell to the lowest
level in almost two months on concern U.S. spending reductions
will hurt global growth, damping demand for riskier assets.  President  Barack Obama  has begun contacting lawmakers in
search of a budget compromise as more than $85 billion in cuts
began March 1 amid a more than two-year-old impasse over raising
taxes and cutting entitlements. Overseas investors sold $237
million more Indian stocks than they bought on Feb. 28, the most
in almost a year, the latest exchange data show.  Developments in major economies “have led to a revival in
risk aversion,” Surbhi Ogra, a Mumbai-based analyst at  ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , wrote in a research report today. “In the near term,
the rupee could face some depreciation pressures.”  The currency declined 0.3 percent to 55.055 per dollar as
of 10:27 a.m. in Mumbai, falling for a third day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 55.0950 earlier, the
weakest level since Jan. 8. One-month implied volatility, a
gauge of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.77
percent.  The rupee may strengthen to around 50 or 51 by June 30,
with the Reserve Bank of India expected to lower interest rates
to support growth, according to ICICI Bank.  India ’s gross
domestic product rose 4.5 percent last quarter, the slowest pace
since 2009, a government report showed Feb. 28.  ‘Realistic’ Budget  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram’s goal to narrow
the budget deficit to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product in
the year through March 2014, from an estimated 5.2 percent in
the preceding 12 months, is “realistic” and credit-positive
for the sovereign, Atsi Sheth, an analyst at Moody’s Investors
Service, wrote in a report today. Chidambaram unveiled the
annual budget on Feb. 28.  The central bank removed restrictions on overnight and
intra-day open positions on foreign-exchange contracts involving
the rupee, it said in a statement on March 1. The curbs were
placed last year as the currency plunged to a record low of
57.3275 per dollar.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.14 per
dollar, compared with 56.00 on March 1, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 56.14 versus 56.12. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
