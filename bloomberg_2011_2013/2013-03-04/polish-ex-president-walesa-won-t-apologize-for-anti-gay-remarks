Lech Walesa , a former Polish
president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said he won’t
apologize for his comments that homosexuals in parliament should
sit behind a wall.  “No minority should climb all over the majority” and gay
deputies shouldn’t sit “somewhere at the front,” Walesa, who
led the Solidarity labor movement that helped bring down
communism in Poland, said in an interview with TVN24 television
channel on March 1. Ruling party and opposition politicians,
including his son Jaroslaw, criticized the comment.  “I won’t apologize to anybody,” Walesa said in an
interview with Radio Zet today. “All I wanted to say is that
these minorities shouldn’t install their views on the majority.
I’m fed up with their flaunting.”  Poland , which joined the European Union in 2004, has
struggled with issues as gay rights, abortion and the role of
the church in public life. The first openly gay and transgender
lawmakers were elected in the 2011 elections. Last month
parliament rejected proposals to introduce civil partnerships.  “These words should never be said,” Jaroslaw Walesa, a
deputy in the European Parliament representing the Civic
Platform party of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, said in an
interview with Radio RMF today. “I was shocked to hear what he
said about homosexuals, I disagree with him and will need talk
to him.”  Walesa, a devout Roman Catholic and a father of eight, was
Poland’s first democratically-elected president after communism.  To contact the reporters on this story:
