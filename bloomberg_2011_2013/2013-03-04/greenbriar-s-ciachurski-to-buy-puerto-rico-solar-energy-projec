Greenbriar Capital Corp. (GRB) , a Canadian
real-estate owner, agreed to sell a subdivision in  California  to
raise funds to buy a 100-megawatt solar project in Puerto Rico,
Chief Executive Officer Jeff Ciachurski said.  The company expects to close the California sale in 90 days
and to complete the solar purchase by year-end, Ciachurski said
in a telephone interview. He didn’t give prices for the deals or
identify the buyer or seller.  Ciachurski resigned as CEO on March 1 of  Western Wind
Energy Corp. (WND)  after Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners LP
bought a controlling the stake in the company. Vancouver-based
Western Wind built 165 megawatts of wind and solar  projects  in
the U.S. and Ciachurski said he’s modeling Greenbriar’s business
on his former company.  “It’s a continuation of a new strategy we had with Western
Wind,”  he said.  Greenbriar plans to develop projects in the same regions as
Western Wind, and has fewer outstanding shares so “you’re not
splitting the pie with as many people,” Ciachurski said.  Greenbriar Capital has 10.9 million outstanding shares
compared to 70.7 million for Western Wind, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Puerto Rico solar project has a contract to sell
electricity to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and is
expected to begin producing power in 2014, he said.  Greenbriar Capital gained 1.4 percent to C$1.42 at the
close in Toronto. The shares have gained 65 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
