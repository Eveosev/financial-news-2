Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II left a
London hospital after being admitted yesterday with symptoms of
gastroenteritis.  U.K. television stations showed the 86-year-old monarch
leaving King Edward VII’s Hospital in the center of the capital
today and stepping into a black limousine.  The queen, whose illness was first announced March 1, has
canceled all official engagements for the coming week, including
a planned two-day visit to  Rome .  Gastroenteritis causes inflammation of the stomach lining
and intestines. It can be transmitted through contact with an
infected person or contaminated food and drink. Symptoms can
include vomiting, fever and stomach ache.  The queen was last hospitalized 10 years ago for a minor
knee operation, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
