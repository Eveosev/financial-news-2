The won fell the most in a month as
slowing services and manufacturing growth in  China  damped South
Korea’s export outlook. Bonds were little changed even as
inflation unexpectedly eased in February.  Expansion in industries including retailing, transport and
banking in  Asia ’s largest economy was the slowest in five months
in February, an official  purchasing managers  showed yesterday. A
manufacturing gauge also decreased on March 1. China is the
largest destination for Korean goods. Consumer prices rose 1.4
percent from a year earlier, compared with the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey for a 1.6 percent increase, official
figures showed today.  “China data was disappointing,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a
Seoul-based currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. “The
downside may be limited for the won as the market also received
carried-over export deals from last month.”  The won fell 0.9 percent from its Feb. 28 close to 1,093.15
per dollar, according to Seoul Money Brokerage Services Ltd.
That was the biggest decline since Jan. 28. Local financial
markets were closed on March 1 for a public holiday. The won
touched 1,093.75 earlier, the weakest level since Feb. 12.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 13 basis points,
or 0.13 percentage point, to 7.2 percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent government bonds
due December 2015 was steady at 2.63 percent from Feb. 28, Korea
Exchange Inc. prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
