Bostjan Jazbec, an International
Monetary Fund expert who helped set up Kosovo’s central bank,
bid to replace Slovenian central bank Governor Marko Kranjec and
sit on the  European Central Bank ’s governing council.  President  Borut Pahor  in January started collecting
proposals for a successor to Kranjec, who said he won’t seek a
second term when it expires in July. Jazbec joins Vice Governor
Janez Fabijan in vying for the job, Finance newspaper reported
today, citing Fabijan. As an independent, without the support of
political leaders, Jazbec said he’s best suited for the post.  “I believe I have the necessary knowledge and experience
to lead the central bank,” Jazbec, 42, said in a phone
interview from Slovenia’s capital Ljubljana. “I have no
political backing from the president, who proposes candidates
for this post, or from lawmakers.”  Slovenia’s next central bank chief will oversee a banking
industry struggling to emerge from the burden of surging bad
loans as the euro-region nation battles its second recession
since 2009. Banks, including the biggest lender Nova Ljubljanska
Banka d.d., last year had to write down the value of their
assets and set aside record loan-loss reserves of 1.5 billion
euros ($1.95 billion), a 23 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to the central bank.  The country is also gripped by a political crisis after
Alenka Bratusek, the leader of the largest opposition group,
replaced  Janez Jansa  as the prime minister Feb. 27. She needs to
have her Cabinet confirmed by mid-March or early elections would
follow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
