Illinois Governor  Pat Quinn  vetoed a
measure today that would have allowed casinos in  Chicago  and
four other cities, calling it “a bad bill” for taxpayers.  An outspoken critic of legalized gambling, Quinn, 64, had
repeatedly telegraphed his objections to lawmakers. He vetoed a
similar measure in August.  “This bill allows for an excessive expansion that is
simply too much, including a casino at the fairgrounds where
families bring their children,” Quinn said in a statement.  In addition to the casinos, it would a have allowed  slot
machines  at Chicago airports. Supporters of the bill said
gambling houses would spur economic growth in the eastern and
northern regions of the state and would draw customers from
neighboring Indiana and  Wisconsin .  The Democratic governor said any expansion of gambling in
the state must come with “comprehensive oversight” and
dedicate revenue from the games to support education.  To contact the reporter on this story:
