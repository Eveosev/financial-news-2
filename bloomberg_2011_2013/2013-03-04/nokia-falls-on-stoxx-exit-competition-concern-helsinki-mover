Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  shares fell to their
lowest level in three months in Helsinki trading after Stoxx
Ltd. said it’s removing the stock from the Euro Stoxx 50 index
and on concern its smartphones are losing market share.  The shares dropped 2.5 percent to 2.65 euros at the close
of trading in Helsinki, the lowest price since Dec. 4, cutting
the Espoo, Finland-based company’s  market value  to 9.9 billion
euros ($13 billion). The stock has fallen 9.3 percent this year.  Nokia is depending on its partnership with Microsoft Corp.
to help win back smartphone users from Apple Inc. and devices
running Google Inc.’s Android software. Fewer Google searches
for the Lumia 920, which runs Microsoft’s Windows phone
software, from its peak in November may mean that demand will
plateau at today’s “low” levels and it’s unlikely to see the
increase in shipments that many expect, said  Pierre Ferragu , a
London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a note
today.  “Over the year, Nokia will also likely face pricing
pressure to shift inventory which will have a negative impact on
profitability,” said Ferragu, who has an underperform
recommendation on the stock and a price target of 1.20 euros.  Nokia will exit the Euro Stoxx 50 March 18, Stoxx said.
That means fund managers that base their portfolio on the
index’s composition will need to sell the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
