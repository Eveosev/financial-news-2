Canadian synthetic light oil
strengthened on the spot market to its widest premium to West
Texas Intermediate in six months as an upgrader that produces
the grade began maintenance.  Production from  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ’s 350,000-barrel-a-day
 upgrader  in Fort McMurray, Alberta, will be reduced as it begins
14 weeks of maintenance on a hydrogen plant at the facility late
in the first quarter, the company said in its fourth quarter
earnings release Feb. 5.  The Calgary oil sands producer also said it will completely
shut down one of two primary upgraders at the plant for a
planned turnaround lasting seven weeks in the second quarter.
The work will reduce the supply of synthetic oil in the market.  Syncrude Sweet oil for April delivery strengthened by $1.35
to a $6.10 premium to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate,
according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc. It was the
biggest premium for the grade since March 4, according to
historical data compiled by Bloomberg.  Western Canada Select, a heavy bitumen blend produced in
Alberta, followed Syncrude higher, gaining $2.25 a barrel to
trade at a $25.75 discount to WTI, according to Net Energy data.  Limited export pipeline capacity out of Alberta has been
depressing the price of Canadian oils over the last several
months, with Western Canada Select reaching a record discount of
$42.50 a barrel on Dec. 14. With reduced output from the Suncor
upgrader, there’s less competition for pipeline space.  Enbridge said Feb. 21 that the for the first time in six
months there was no apportionment on export lines 4 and 67 to
the U.S. Midwest from Alberta. The lines carry a combined 1.25
million barrels a day, and were apportioned for five months
through February, meaning there wasn’t enough pipeline space to
meet all requests to transport oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
