State Street Corp. (STT) , the third-
biggest custody bank, appointed Maria Dwyer as chief risk
officer of its asset management unit.  The appointment of Dwyer, 54, formerly chief regulatory
officer at Massachusetts Financial Service Co., is effective
immediately, Boston-based State Street said today in a
statement. She will report to Scott Powers, chief executive
officer of the State Street Global Advisors investment unit, and
Andrew Kuritzkes, head of enterprise risk management at the
parent company. Dwyer’s role was previously held on an interim
basis by Fredrik Gjerstad, global head of investment risk.  SSgA, the second-biggest U.S. money manager behind New
York-based  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , is known for its institutional index-
based investment products and exchange-traded funds. Assets
under management rose 13 percent in 2012 to $2.1 trillion as
clients deposited $24 billion, including $13 billion to ETFs.  “Maria brings a combination of experience in key risk and
compliance oversight roles as well as operations and processes
in investment management,” Powers said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
