A team of officials from the so-
called troika that oversees euro-area bailouts will travel to
Cyprus tomorrow to restart talks on a planned rescue, said
European Central Bank Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen.  “A group of troika experts will travel to Cyprus
tomorrow,” Asmussen told reporters in Brussels today after a
meeting of euro-area finance ministers. “It’s a technical
analysis and to get an understanding of the positions of the new
Cypriot government.”  Asmussen said that reports that the ECB plans to withdraw
from the troika are incorrect.  “The ECB will not withdraw from the troika and any reports
which suggest this are unfounded,” he said. “We don’t see any
that to our independence while we are participating in the
troika.  We are providing expertise. Experts are participating
in troika missions while monetary policy decisions are made by
the Governing Council.”  ECB participation in the troika is “key,” he said. “We
have a great knowledge about  Europe , its institutions, its
economy and we especially provide expertise on macroeconomic
issues and especially financial-sector issues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
