Euro-area  producer-price inflation 
slowed in January led by easing price growth for energy.  Factory-gate prices  in the 17-nation euro region rose 1.9
percent from a year earlier, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. That’s in line with the median
of 16 economists’ forecasts in a  Bloomberg News survey . From the
prior month, prices increased 0.6 percent.  Energy costs at the producer level rose an annual 2.8
percent in January after a 3.6 percent increase in the previous
month, the statistics office said. Prices of intermediate goods
rose 1.3 percent after a 1.6 percent increase in December.  In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, producer-price
inflation accelerated to 1.7 percent from 1.5 percent in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
