Mattel Inc. (MAT)  raised $500 million with
bonds as the world’s biggest  toymaker  prepares to refinance
outstanding obligations.  The company sold $250 million of 1.7 percent, five-year
bonds that yield 95 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and an equal amount of 3.15 percent, 10-year
securities with a 130 basis-point spread, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used to repay debt,
including its $350 million of 5.625 percent securities due this
month, the El Segundo, California-based company said today in a
regulatory filing.  The offering “appears very attractive to us,” Joscelyn MacKay, an analyst at Chicago-based  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , wrote
today in a report. Fair value may be a spread of about 100 to
110 basis points for the 10-year portion and about 25 to 35
basis points less than that level for the five-year debt, she
said.  The new bonds are expected to be  rated  Baa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
