The Environmental Protection Agency
will furlough employees for as many as 13 days in the next seven
months as the agency complies with automatic U.S. spending cuts
that took effect this month.  In a memo to staff late on March 1, acting EPA
Administrator Bob Perciasepe said that to meet a reduction of
$425 million ordered in a process known as sequestration the
agency will have furloughs and cuts in grants and contracts.
Staff will take four, unpaid furlough days by June, followed by
an assessment to see if as many as nine additional furlough days
are necessary, Perciasepe wrote.  “We anticipate that furloughs will not begin until later
in April,” he wrote. “Also, employees will work with their
supervisors to schedule furlough days.”  President  Barack Obama  today tapped Gina McCarthy, an
assistant administrator at the agency, to lead the EPA. Her
nomination requires U.S. Senate confirmation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
