Copper gained for the first time in
three days in  London  after Bank of  Japan  governor nominee
Haruhiko Kuroda said he would do whatever it take to curb
deflation and as U.S. manufacturing data beat expectations.
Aluminum rose for the first time in 11 days.  Copper for delivery in three months climbed as much as 0.8
percent to $7,761 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before trading at $7,749 at 11:13 a.m. Tokyo time. The metal
touched $7,652 on March 1, the lowest since Nov. 19, and dropped
1.3 percent last week.  Kuroda told a parliamentary hearing that the BOJ hasn’t
bought enough assets to end deflation. U.S.  consumer confidence 
increased and manufacturing grew at the fastest pace since June
2011, easing concern about the economy as $85 billion of federal
spending cuts were set to begin.  “Kuroda’s comment and last Friday’s better-than-expected
U.S. data provided support for copper and other metals,” said
Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co.
in  Seoul . Still, rising stockpiles in London and Shanghai would
limit further gains in copper, while investors are closely
watching  China  this week for direction, Hwang said.  Chinese legislators begin an annual conference tomorrow,
during which the government usually announces economic targets
for the year. China’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index
was 50.1 in February, according to government data on March 1.
The reading compares with 50.4 in January. A number above 50
indicates expansion.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose to 226,201 tons last week, the highest since March
2012, while those tracked by the London exchange extended to
458,775 tons, a 16-month high.  Copper for May delivery on the Shanghai exchange declined
0.3 percent to 56,550  yuan  ($9,078) a ton. The May contract on
the Comex in New York gained 0.5 percent to $3.5175 per pound.  On the LME, zinc, lead, nickel and tin also climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
