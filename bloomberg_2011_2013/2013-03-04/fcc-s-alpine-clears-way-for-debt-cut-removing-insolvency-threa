Alpine Holding GmbH’s bonds jumped
after the unprofitable Austrian builder cleared the way for a
debt cut yesterday by winning creditor banks’ agreement to
reduce their claims while leaving its bondholders unscathed.  Alpine’s bonds due July 2015, June 2016 and May 2017 were
quoted at 18 percentage points to 20 percentage points higher
than last week on German securities exchanges, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The debt, which has a combined
nominal value of 290 million euros ($377 million), was quoted at
just over 50 percent of face value in their most recent trades
last week.  Lenders to Salzburg-based Alpine, a unit of Spanish builder
 Fomento de Construcciones & Contratas SA , reached the final
steps of the deal by agreeing to include debt that would have
been covered by state guarantees in the event of default, the
Austrian company said in a statement late yesterday.  Bondholders won’t lose money in the debt cut, Alpine said,
without elaborating on other terms of the agreement. The bonds
due May 2017 jumped 41 percent to 70.2 cents on the euro, the
biggest intraday increase in four months. Alpine’s debt due in
2016 was 41 percent higher at 70.25 cents, while the 2015 bonds
were trading 38 percent higher at 71.01 cents.  Alpine, which built German soccer team Bayern Munich’s
Allianz Arena stadium, contributed to its parent FCC’s net loss
of 1.03 billion euros last year with a 300.5 million-euro
charge. Austria and  Germany  account for about two-thirds of its
output, and more than 20 percent comes from eastern and
southeastern  Europe .  The creditor banks, led by  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and
UniCredit Bank Austria AG, agreed to reduce their claims,
totaling about 520 million euros, by 30 percent in the debt-
reduction deal, two people familiar with the talks said last
week. The state-guaranteed portion of that debt was 150 million
euros, the people said. Spokesmen for Erste and UniCredit
declined to comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
