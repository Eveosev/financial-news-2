CBS Corp. (CBS)  Chief Executive Officer
 Leslie Moonves  said the television industry is moving toward
counting viewership over seven days in response to the growing
use of digital video recorders and online viewing.  Nielsen, the New York-based company that measures TV
audiences, will adopt a seven-day standard next year, an
increase from the current three days, Moonves predicted
yesterday at an investor conference sponsored by Deutsche Bank
AG.  CBS’s TV shows draw about 40 percent of their audience on
digital video recorders, video-on-demand services and online,
Moonves said. If a show is watched within three days of airing,
the network is paid by advertisers for those viewers. Networks
and advertisers are discussing whether later viewing should be
discounted or if new ads should be inserted, he said.  “We want Nielsen to count everybody,” Moonves said.
“Ultimately, we want an eyeball to count as an eyeball no
matter where you watch your television show.”  CBS, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , gained 0.5
percent to $43.78 yesterday at the  New York  close. The stock has
climbed 15 percent this year.  Nielsen already provides networks and advertisers with
seven-day commercial viewing, Moonves said. What’s missing is
agreement between advertisers and programmers, he said.  “It’s coming right around the corner,” Moonves said.
“That will be good for us.”  Television networks and advertisers will decide which data
to use as a basis for their transactions, Nielsen said in an e-
mail response to questions about Moonves’s comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
