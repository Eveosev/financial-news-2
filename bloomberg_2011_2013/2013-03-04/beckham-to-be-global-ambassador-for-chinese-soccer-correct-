David Beckham  will help promote
soccer in  China  by taking a role as a global ambassador for the
game in the world’s most populous country.  The former captain of England’s national team, who joined
French club Paris Saint-Germain in January, will visit China
this year to help advance both the sport and the country’s Super
League.  “I’m excited by the prospect of promoting the world’s
greatest game to football fans inside China as I’ve seen
firsthand that there’s a great interest in football from sports
fans in China,” Beckham, 37, said in a statement issued by IMG
Worldwide Inc. “This is a wonderful sport that inspires people
across the world and brings families together, so I’m relishing
the opportunity of welcoming more fans to the game.”  The Chinese Football Association has invited Beckham as it
looks to introduce soccer to the more than 1.3 billion people in
the country and inspire children to play.  Professional soccer in China celebrates its 20th
anniversary in 2013 and the Super League begins its 10th season
on March 8. Beckham will attend Super League matches and visit
with clubs while in China.  Beckham, who started his career at English club  Manchester
United  before joining Spain’s Real Madrid in 2003, signed a
five-month contract with PSG in January after his agreement with
 Major League Soccer ’s Los Angeles Galaxy expired. He served as
an ambassador to the 2012 London Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
