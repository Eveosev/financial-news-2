Repairs to a coal-exporting railway
line in Queensland,  Australia , linking mines to the port of
Gladstone, are being hampered by continuing rainfall, a port
agent said.  The  Moura Short Line  is closed because of flooding and
services arenâ€™t expected to resume until later this week, Gulf
Agency Company (Australia) Pty. Ltd. said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
