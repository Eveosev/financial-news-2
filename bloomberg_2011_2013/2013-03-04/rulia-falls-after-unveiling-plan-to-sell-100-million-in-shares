Trulia Inc. (TRLA) , the operator of a
residential-property listings website, fell in late trading
after announcing plans to sell an additional $100 million in
shares.  The company will use the proceeds to acquire or invest in
businesses or technologies that complement its own, San
Francisco-based Trulia said in a statement. Shares fell to as
low as $26.20 in extended trading after gaining 3 percent to $28
at the close in New York.  The stock declined on concern that the sale will dilute the
stakes of existing holders. Trulia shares had  surged  to a record
last month amid optimism that gains in U.S. home prices would
help boost advertising sales. The company competes with larger
rival Zillow Inc. for listings and revenue from advertisers
seeking to reach home buyers and renters.  Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  RBC Capital
Markets  are managing the offering, Trulia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
