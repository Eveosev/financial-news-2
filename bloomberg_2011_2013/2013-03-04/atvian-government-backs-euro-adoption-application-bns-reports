Latvia will apply tomorrow to the
European Union for permission to adopt the euro next year after
the government confirmed the country meets all legal and
economic criteria, the Baltic News Service reported.  A formal assessment of the application from the European
Commission and European Central Bank will probably be made in
late June, Finance Minister Andris Vilks said today after a
Cabinet meeting in Riga, according to BNS.  Given that pending decision, as well as a subsequent need
for political approval by leaders of EU members, Latvia canâ€™t
relax its preparations to adopt the common currency on Jan. 1,
2014, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters, the
newswire reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
