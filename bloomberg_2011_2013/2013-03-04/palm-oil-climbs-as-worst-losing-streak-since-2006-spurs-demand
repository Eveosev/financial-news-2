Palm oil climbed for the first time
in nine days on speculation that the worst losing streak since
2006 may stoke demand, cutting reserves in  Indonesia  and
 Malaysia , the world’s biggest producers.  The contract for May delivery climbed as much as 1.3
percent to 2,399 ringgit ($773) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and was at 2,392 ringgit at 11:48 a.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures tumbled 6.6 percent last week.  Palm, used in foods, biofuels and cosmetics, has slumped 26
percent in the past year as stockpiles surged to records and
demand for the tropical oil fell due to a global economic
slowdown. Inventories in Indonesia may drop 8 percent to 2.3
million tons this year as a significant increase in demand
outstrips record supplies, according to Derom Bangun, chairman
of the nation’s palm board.  “The decline in prices will attract some buying,” said
Prathamesh Mallya, an analyst at AnandRathi Commodities Ltd. in
Mumbai. “You will see more of palm oil being imported in  India 
in the near future because there is a shortage of soybean oil.
Across the markets, be it Chinese or U.S., edible oils have been
positive today and this is also reflecting on palm.”  Soybeans for May delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $14.495 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for May was
little changed at 49.66 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September gained 0.6
percent to 6,650  yuan  ($1,068) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month climbed 0.9
percent to 8,328 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
