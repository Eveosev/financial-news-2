Five-time Grand Slam singles
champion  Martina Hingis  was elected to the  International Tennis
Hall of Fame , as was longtime broadcaster Cliff Drysdale.  Promoter Charlie Pasarell and former Romanian player Ion Tiriac, who became a manager and promoter, also will be
enshrined in the Newport,  Rhode Island , museum in July, it said
on its  website . Australian player Thelma Coyne Long, who won 19
Grand Slam titles from 1936 to 1958, was named a member of the
class of 2013 in January.  Hingis, a 32-year-old from Switzerland who retired in 2007,
won 43 WTA Tour singles titles and 37 doubles tournaments,
earning $20.1 million.  She won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the  U.S. Open  in
1997 and successfully defended her Australian Open title the
following two years. Hingis held the season-ending No. 1 ranking
in 1997, 1999 and 2000, and spent 209 weeks at No. 1 for her
career.  Drysdale, Pasarell and Tiriac were elected as contributors
to the sport.  Drysdale, 71, a former player from South Africa who rose as
high as No. 4 in the world rankings, helped start the ATP World
Tour and has been a tennis broadcaster for ESPN since its first
telecast of the sport in 1979.  Pasarell, 69, another former player originally from  Puerto
Rico , also helped start the ATP World Tour and was the owner of
the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California.  Tiriac, 73, from Romania, was a doubles partner of Ilie Nastase who went on to manage the careers of players such as
 Boris Becker , Guillermo Vilas and Mary Joe Fernandez.  Coyne Long was elected out of the Hallâ€™s Master Player
category. The 94-year-old from Sydney won her Grand Slam titles
in singles, doubles and mixed doubles.  The enshrinement ceremony is scheduled for July 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
