Dubai’s stocks declined the most in
a month as investors speculated  Emaar Properties PJSC’s (EMAAR)  rally
this year was overdone and after crude oil dropped.  Emaar, the developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper,
decreased the most in almost a week, trimming a rally in 2013 to
42 percent.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)  tumbled 10 percent, taking the
loss to 27 percent in the three days after it announced a
capital increase via rights shares. The benchmark  DFM General
Index (DFMGI)  retreated 1.9 percent, the most since Feb. 3, to 1,899.10
at the close.  Emaar, which has the  heaviest weighting  on Dubai’s gauge,
is the best-performing stock on the index this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company, whose 2012 profit
jumped  18 percent,  is benefiting from a property recovery in the
emirate, whose economy grew at the fastest pace in five years in
2012, according to government estimates.  “Against a discouraging external backdrop, recent buyers
sat on the sidelines and the stock took a long overdue
breather,” said  Julian Bruce , Dubai-based head of institutional
trading at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE.  Emaar’s rally this year compares with a gain of 17 percent
for the benchmark. The stock fell 2.6 percent today, the most
since Feb. 26, to 5.34 dirhams after its  14-day relative
strength index  tumbled to 67 from 76. A reading above 70
indicates to some analysts that a security is poised to decline.  China Mortgage Rules  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of developing nation stocks
dropped 1 percent after  China  tightened mortgage rules to cool
its residential  property market . Crude oil for April delivery
decreased as much as 0.7 percent to $90.09 a barrel. Gulf Arab
oil exporters, including Qatar and the U.A.E., supply about a
fifth of the world’s oil.  Arabtec, the U.A.E.’s biggest builder by market value,
tumbled the most since January 2009 to 2.17 dirhams. The company
said Feb. 27 it’s seeking to raise $1.74 billion to fund
internal growth, acquisitions and joint ventures. The plan
includes $450 million of convertible bonds, as well as a rights
issue.  “Investors remain concerned over the dilutive impact of
any new convertible bond,” Bruce said yesterday. “Greater
detail of any issue, including conversion price, will be
required to afford any degree of comfort.”  About  228 million shares  traded in Dubai today, compared
with a 12-month daily average of 171 million, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
