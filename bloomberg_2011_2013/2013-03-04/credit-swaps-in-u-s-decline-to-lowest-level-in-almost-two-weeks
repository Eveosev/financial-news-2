A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell to its lowest level in almost two weeks amid renewed
demands of austerity measures in the Euro area.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, fell 0.6
basis point to a mid-price of 85.8 basis points at 7:56 a.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest since Feb. 19 when the measure reached 85.4 basis points.  European leaders demanded that euro members press on with
budget cuts to end the debt crisis as  Italy  edged closer to a
new election after an anti-austerity vote last week resulted in
political deadlock. Signs of global recovery may ease investor
concern that companies’ ability to repay debt will be hampered.
Finance ministers from the 17-member, single-currency bloc meet
in Brussels today to discuss economic issues.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
