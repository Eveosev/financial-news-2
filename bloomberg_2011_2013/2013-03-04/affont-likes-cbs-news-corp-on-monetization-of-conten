Philippe Laffont, founder of $7
billion hedge fund Coatue Management LLC, said he likes  Time
Warner Inc. (TWC) ,  CBS Corp. (CBS)  and News Corp. as the companies seek to
profit from the sale of consumer content via mobile devices.  “The world’s going to move toward content being monetized
in a lot of different ways,” Laffont said today in an interview
on Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers,” with Stephanie
Ruhle and  Erik Schatzker . “There’s a few great companies, all
based here in America, that are excellent at producing
content.”  Laffont worked for Julian Robertson at Tiger Management LLC
before starting New York-based long-short equity hedge fund
Coatue in 1999. The firm bought shares of CBS Corp. in the
fourth quarter and added to its stakes in Time Warner Inc., Time
Warner Cable Inc. and  Viacom Inc. (VIAB)   “Soon everybody is going to have a smart phone,” Laffont
said. “What do you do once everyone has a phone? Content is
going to become much more important. Once you have a phone or
iPad, you start watching movies a lot more.”  Coatue held 10.2 million shares of Time Warner Inc., 3.3
million shares of Time Warner Cable, 3.1 million shares of CBS
and 11.3 million shares of  News Corp. (NWSA)  as of Dec. 31, according
to the firm’s latest regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
