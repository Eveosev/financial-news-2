Brazil ’s swap rates rose for the
first time in four days as economists raised their inflation
forecasts and traders speculated that central bank policy makers
will signal a rate increase at their meeting this week.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2014 climbed one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.63 percent at 10:16
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.9844
per  U.S. dollar .  The central bank begins a two-day policy meeting tomorrow
to decide whether to hold the target lending rate known as the
Selic at a record low 7.25 percent for a third time to support
the economy even as inflation has exceeded the 4.5 percent
midpoint of its preferred range for more than two years.  “If the central bank changes the language in its statement
this week, the market is going to incorporate an increase in the
Selic rate,” Luis Otavio de Souza Leal, the chief economist at
Banco ABC Brasil SA in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.  Annual inflation a year from now will be 5.62 percent,
according to the central bank’s weekly survey of economists
published today, up from a 5.49 percent estimate a week ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
