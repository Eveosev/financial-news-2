Oil rebounded from the lowest level
in 10 weeks as traders speculated recent declines may have been
excessive, while a North Sea pipeline system remained shut after
a platform leak.  West Texas Intermediate advanced as much as 0.6 percent,
and Brent futures as much as 0.9 percent. The Brent pipeline
system was closed for a fourth day after an oil leak was
discovered March 2 on the Cormorant Alpha platform, according to
 Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA)  PJSC, the operator known as Taqa.
U.S.  crude stockpiles  probably increased for a seventh week, the
longest stretch since May, a Bloomberg News survey showed before
Energy Department data tomorrow.  “It’s worth keeping an eye on developments at Cormorant
Alpha since any prolonged disruption in the North Sea would
support Brent,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB
Capital in  London  who predicts that Brent will trade in a range
of $109 to $112 a barrel this month.  WTI for April delivery rose as much as 58 cents to $90.70 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $90.65 at 1:24 p.m. London time. The volume of all
futures traded was 28 percent below the 100-day average. The
contract fell 56 cents to $90.12 yesterday, the lowest close
since Dec. 24.  Brent for April settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange gained as much as 97 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$111.06 a barrel. The volume of all futures traded was 38
percent above the 100-day average. The European benchmark grade
was at a $20.14 premium to WTI, widening for a fourth day.  Brent Pipeline  WTI rebounded as a technical indicator showed prices may
have fallen too quickly for further losses to be sustainable.
The 14-day relative strength index yesterday dropped below 30
for the first time since June 28, signaling the market may be
oversold. Today’s reading was around 32.  Production from the 27  North Sea  oil fields that make up
the Brent system remained shut and a series of safety checks
must be completed before it can be reopened, an official at Taqa
who asked not to be identified because of company policy, said
today by phone from Aberdeen,  Scotland , without detailing a
time-frame.  The system normally carries 90,000 barrels a day of crude
and accounts for about 10 percent of the U.K.’s oil production.
About 10,000 barrels a day were already offline following a
similar incident at the same platform on Jan. 14.  Crude Supplies  U.S. crude inventories probably rose 788,000 barrels last
week, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg before tomorrow’s Energy Department report.
Gasoline stockpiles decreased  250,000 barrels  and distillate
supplies slid 1 million barrels, the survey showed.  The  American Petroleum Institute  is scheduled to release
separate supply data today. The industry group collects
stockpile information on a voluntary basis from operators of
refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The government
requires that reports be filed with the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistics unit, for its
weekly survey.  “We have an improvement in general  market sentiment ,”
said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .
“But it’s too early to call for a new uptrend in prices.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
