Japan ’s interest in importing U.S.
natural gas from shale with contracts linked to the U.S.
benchmark at Henry Hub threatens as many as 50 liquefied natural
gas projects in  Australia  that rely on oil-indexed prices,
Hartland Shipping Services Ltd. said. The following are comments
from the London-based shipbroker in a report dated March 1.  “A move to spot and short-term gas-linked pricing arguably
cannot underpin the long-term financing and return expectations
of many developers. America is shaking things up.”  “Japanese, Korean and Chinese buyers are pulling back from
supporting pricey Australian and other LNG projects that need
the old Asian pricing formula to turn a profit, preferring
instead to exploit the arbitrage of buying cheaper U.S.
exports.”  “Japan was a hesitant mover in America as the only one of
17 U.S. LNG export projects so far approved, Cheniere’s Sabine
Pass in  Louisiana , has presold its production to Korean,
British, Indian and Spanish buyers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
