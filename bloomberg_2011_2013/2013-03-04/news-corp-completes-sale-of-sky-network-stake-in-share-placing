News Corp. (NWSA)  completed the sale of its
44 percent stake in  Sky Network Television Ltd. (SKT) , New Zealand’s
largest pay-TV operator.  News Ltd., a unit of  Rupert Murdoch ’s media company, sold
the shares to a range of institutional investors, Sky Network
said in a statement today. Sky Network’s shares fell as low as
NZ$4.84 after a block of 163.1 million crossed at NZ$4.80 prior
to the market’s open.  News appointed Deutsche Bank AG and Craigs Investment
Partners to sell the holding, Sky Network said yesterday. The
sale will free up capital amid News Corp.’s plans to separate
its television business from the declining publishing division
by the middle of this year.  Sky Network shares fell 21 New Zealand cents, or 4.1
percent, to NZ$4.96 at 11:16 a.m. in Wellington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
