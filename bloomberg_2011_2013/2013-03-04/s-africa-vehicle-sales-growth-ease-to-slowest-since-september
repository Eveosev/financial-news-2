South African new vehicle  sales 
expanded 1.6 percent in February from a year earlier, the
slowest pace since September.  Purchases rose to 53,220 last month from 52,388 a year
earlier, the Pretoria-based National Association of Automobile
Manufacturers of South Africa said in an e-mailed  statement 
today.  Quickening inflation and a weaker rand “could result in
further moderation in the rate of growth in sales over the
balance of the year,” Naamsa said.  The Reserve Bank kept the benchmark  repurchase rate  at the
lowest level in more than 30 years in January as inflation near
the top end of its target limited the room it had to stimulate
an economy that grew 2.5 percent last year, the slowest pace
since a 2009 recession.  The inflation rate will breach the top of the bank’s target
of 3 percent to 6 percent later this year, according to Reserve
Bank Governor Gill Marcus. The rand has dropped 6.7 percent
against the dollar in 2013, the worst performer among 25
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg.  Passenger-car sales increased 0.8 percent to 36,666 in
February, while vehicle exports rose 22 percent to 27,611.  To contact the reporter on this story:
