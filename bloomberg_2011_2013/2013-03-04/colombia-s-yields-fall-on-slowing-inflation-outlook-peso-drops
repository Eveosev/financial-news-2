Colombia ’s peso bond yields declined
for a third day on speculation inflation slowed last month below
the central bank’s target range, supporting appetite for the
fixed-rate securities.  Yields on peso bonds maturing in 2024 decreased one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.98 percent at 9:54 a.m. in
Bogota, according to the central bank. The yields dropped to
4.97 percent on Feb. 22, the lowest level since the securities
were issued in 2009.  “The market is pricing in low inflation,” Jorge Cardozo,
an analyst at Corredores Asociados brokerage in Bogota, said in
a phone interview. “Inflation will likely be the driver today
and tomorrow ahead of the report.”  Annual inflation slowed to 1.89 percent in February,
according to the median forecast of 19 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before tomorrow’s government report. The rate slowed
to 2 percent in January, at the bottom of the bank’s target
range of 3 percent plus or minus one percentage point.  Inflation cooled even as the central bank lowered the
target rate by 1.5 percentage points beginning in July, the most
among  emerging markets  after  Hungary .  The peso erased an earlier gain today, declining 0.1
percent to 1,814.75 per  U.S. dollar  and extending its drop this
year to 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
