Minneapolis Federal Reserve
President  Narayana Kocherlakota  said he believes the Fed will
have to lower its threshold for the unemployment rate before it
begins raising its target interest rate.  “I worry that we’ll come to a point where we’re going to
want to do this later anyway -- that is, lower the unemployment
threshold -- and we’ll have lost all the stimulus we could have
provided in the intervening period by lowering it ahead of
time,” Kocherlakota said in a December interview that was
posted today on the Minneapolis Fed’s website as part of its
annual report.  In December, the Fed said it would hold  interest rates  near
zero as least as long as joblessness remained above a threshold
of 6.5 percent on the  unemploymen t rate. The central bank also
said it would consider raising rates if the outlook for
inflation breached its threshold of 2.5 percent. Kocherlakota
said a 5.5 percent goal on the  unemployment rate  would have been
better.  “We have left an opportunity out there for improvement by
setting it as high as we did,” Kocherlakota said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
