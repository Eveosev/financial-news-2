Hostess Brands Inc.’s planned sales
of most of its bread business shouldn’t be approved as currently
structured because the buyers would be improperly released from
liabilities and obligations to comply with environmental laws,
the U.S. said.  U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in  Manhattan  objected March 1
to agreements reached last week with  Flowers Foods Inc. (FLO) , which
is set to buy brands including Wonder for about $360 million,
and  Grupo Bimbo SAB (BIMBOA) , which plans to buy the Beefsteaks brand for
about $31.9 million.  “The proposed sale order, as currently drafted, would
diminish or eliminate the government’s ability to enforce
generally applicable police and regulatory statutes and
regulations, and diminish or eliminate the buyer’s and debtor’s
obligations to comply with environmental, health and safety
laws,” Bharara said in the objection filed in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan.  Hostess, founded in 1930, is liquidating after failing to
reach an agreement with striking bakers on concessions to help
the company emerge from its second bankruptcy.  Lance Ignon, a spokesman for Hostess, said he couldn’t
immediately comment on the U.S. objection.  Previously known as Interstate Bakeries Corp., Hostess left
an earlier bankruptcy in 2009 under the control of buyout firm
Ripplewood Holdings LLC and lenders. The company, based in
Irving,  Texas , entered bankruptcy again in January 2012.  The case is In re Hostess Brands Inc., 12-bk-22052, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
