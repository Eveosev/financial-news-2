Three main opposition groups in
 Guinea  asked international mediators to help establish a
framework for talks with the presidency before a legislative
vote scheduled for May.  Outside mediators could help ease tension in the West
African nation after local negotiators gave up “following the
obstinate refusal of those in power to allow for a rapprochement
with the opposition,” Aboubacar Sylla, a spokesman for the
opposition coalition, told reporters in capital, Conakry today.  Government spokesman Albert Damantang Camara said talks
under the directive of Prime Minister Mohamed Said Fofana were
to start soon. He urged political leaders to “call on their
supporters to respect the peace and wait until the negotiations
end.”  Last week, seven people were killed in clashes between
government forces and opposition supporters demanding more
transparency in the electoral process, according to the
opposition.  Guinea’s opposition is concerned about voter registration
and other preparations for the elections now planned for May 12,
after two delays. President  Alpha Conde , who came to office in
2010, has accused the opposition of blocking electoral reform
and obstructing the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
