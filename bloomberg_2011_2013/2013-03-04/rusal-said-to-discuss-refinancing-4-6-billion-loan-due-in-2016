United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s
largest aluminum producer, is holding preliminary talks with
international lenders to arrange $4.6 billion of loan
refinancing, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Rusal is seeking  new funds  to settle the debt with state-
run OAO Sberbank, which matures in 2016, the people said, asking
not to be identified because the talks are private. They didn’t
name the potential new lenders.  Rusal restructured $17 billion of borrowings in 2009 and
had debt of $10.8 billion as of Dec. 31, 2012, a presentation
posted on the Moscow-based company’s website today shows. Rusal
needs to pay $500 million to Russian lenders this year and $1.5
billion to domestic and international lenders in 2014, the
presentation shows.  The aluminum company in 2010 arranged a $4.6 billion loan
from Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest lender, at a rate of 4.5 percent
above London Interbank Offered Rate, due in 2013 to refinance a
similar amount owed to state-run development bank VEB. Sberbank
agreed two years ago to extend the loan to 2016.  Officials for Rusal and Sberbank declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
