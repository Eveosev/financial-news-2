Scor SE (SCR) , France’s largest reinsurer,
signed an agreement worth 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in
premiums with BBVA Seguros SA to reinsure mortality risk on
mortgages and personal loans.  Under the accord, Scor assumes a quota share of 90 percent
of the majority of the Spanish insurer’s single premium and
regular premium business for the policies, the Paris-based
company said in a statement today.  The block transaction, made via Scor’s Irish reinsurance
unit, will start by generating gross premiums of 120 million
euros this year, Scor said.  BBVA Seguros is owned by Bilbao, Spain-based  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
