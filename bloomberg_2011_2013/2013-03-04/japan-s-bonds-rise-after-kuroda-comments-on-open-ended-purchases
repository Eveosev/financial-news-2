Japan ’s bonds rose, pushing five-
year  yields  to a record low, after prospective  Bank of Japan (8301) 
governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he would consider starting the
central bank’s open-ended asset purchases sooner.  Benchmark 30-year bond yields slid to a 2 1/2-year low
after Kuroda said the BOJ should acquire longer-dated bonds and
there’s no need for it to limit buying to three-year maturities.
Five-year  rates  dropped to 0.095 percent, falling below the rate
the BOJ pays to financial companies on excess reserves. The
Ministry of Finance will sell as much as 2.4 trillion yen ($26
billion) of 10-year bonds tomorrow.  “There is still some more room for yields to decline,”
said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $19 billion in
Tokyo. “Expectations are mounting that the BOJ will step up
monetary easing and increase purchases of government bonds.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell 4 1/2 basis
points to 0.60 percent at 4:45 p.m. in Tokyo from last week,
according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker. The price of the 0.8 percent security
maturing in December 2022 advanced 0.422 yen to 101.849. The
yield was the lowest since June 2003 and its decline was the
biggest since July 2011. Benchmark debt rose for an eighth day,
the longest rally since Dec. 24, 2008.  Five-year rates declined two basis points to 0.095 percent.
Thirty-year yields fell nine basis points to 1.675 percent, a
level unseen since August 2010. Twenty-year yields dropped as
much as eight basis points to 1.49 percent, the least since
August 2003. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery climbed 0.27 to
145.32, the highest for a lead contract.  Kuroda Hearing  Kuroda said that the central bank will do whatever is
needed to end 15 years of deflation should he be confirmed as
governor and indicated that open-ended asset purchases could
start sooner than next year.  “I would like to make my stance clear that we will do
whatever we can do,” Kuroda, the president of the Asian
Development Bank, said at a confirmation hearing in the
parliament in  Tokyo  today. The central bank hasn’t bought enough
assets and should buy longer-term bonds, he said.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s nomination of Kuroda has
spurred forecasts for more aggressive easing after Masaaki
Shirakawa exits the job on March 19. The opposition
Democratic Party of Japan, the largest party in the upper house,
has signaled it will back Kuroda, easing his passage through a
split Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
