China’s national legislature will
decide on government positions including central bank governor
by March 16 amid reports  Zhou Xiaochuan  will remain chief of the
People’s Bank of China.  The decisions on the nation’s president, vice president,
premier, ministers and PBOC will occur during the final third of
the sessions, Fu Ying, spokeswoman for the National People’s
Congress, said today at a press briefing in Beijing, indicating
the moves will come between March 13 and March 16.  Zhou will extend his record tenure as PBOC governor even
after he was left off the Communist Party’s revamped Central
Committee list, a person with direct knowledge of the
discussions said last month. Retaining Zhou, 65, during the
party’s once-a-decade leadership transition would provide
stability at a time when the PBOC is grappling with rising risks
from shadow banking and is changing how it conducts  monetary
policy .  The party’s omission of Zhou from its new 205-member
Central Committee in November and a Feb. 2 profile by the
official  China  Securities Journal that said he’d step down in
March had suggested the governor, who took office in 2002, would
leave as part of a once-a-decade leadership change.  --Zheng Lifei. Editors: Scott Lanman, John Liu  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
