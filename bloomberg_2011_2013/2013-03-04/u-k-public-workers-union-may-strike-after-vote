Public-sector workers in Britain’s
largest civil-service union voted to strike to protest cuts in
pay and working conditions imposed by Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government.  The Public and Commercial Services union, representing
about 270,000 civil servants, said a ballot of its members
showed 61 percent backing for strikes, while eight in every 10
favored some form of “industrial action.” The turnout was 28
percent of those entitled to vote. The union’s executive will
meet in “the coming days” to plan how to act.  “Civil and public servants are working harder than ever to
provide the services we all rely on but, instead of rewarding
them, the government is cutting their pay, raiding their
pensions and trying to rip up their basic working conditions,”
PCS General Secretary  Mark Serwotka  said in an a  statement on
the union’s website .  The union is seeking a 5 percent wage increase for its
members this year to begin making up for what it says is a 7
percent fall in earnings since 2008. The government has targeted
public-sector pay as it imposes the biggest budget squeeze since
World War II to narrow its deficit.  The PCS is wrong to “insist on futile action” and the
union’s leadership is unable to convince “large swathes” of
its members to back its strike plans, the Cabinet Office said in
an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
