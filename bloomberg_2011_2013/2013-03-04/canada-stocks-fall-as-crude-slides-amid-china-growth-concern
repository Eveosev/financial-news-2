Canadian  stocks  fell for a second
day, led by raw-materials and energy producers, on concern
changes in China’s government policy may stunt growth in the
world’s second-biggest economy.  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  and  Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)  Ltd.
slipped at least 2.3 percent as the price of crude fell below
$90 for the first time in more than two months.  Agrium Inc. (AGU) 
dropped 2.1 percent after its chairman urged shareholders to
vote against a board slate backed by an activist shareholder.
 Aurizon Mines Ltd. (ARZ)  gained 4 percent after agreeing to sell
itself to Hecla Mining Co. in a deal valued at C$796 million
($774 million).  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 56.16
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,716.96 at 12:56 p.m. in Toronto.
Materials companies erased 1.8 percent, the most among the
index’s 10 groups, and energy producers slid 0.8 percent.
Trading volume was 9.1 percent below the 30-day average at this
time of the day. The S&P/TSX has risen 2.3 percent this year.  “The market had been getting close to new highs and people
are getting uncomfortable,” said Paul Harris, a fund manager
with Avenue Investment Management in Toronto, which oversees
about C$300 million. “India and China, those stock exchanges
have come off a fair bit in the last little while. People have
seen the market run up a lot in the last two to three months and
were expecting a pullback.”  China Growth  The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite  Index (SHCOMP)  fell 3.7
percent today, the most since August 2011, after China’s cabinet
last week ordered tighter mortgage rules to cool the property
market. The Chinese government is seeking higher downpayments on
second-home loans and stricter enforcement of sales-tax policy.
Separately, data yesterday showed China’s service industries
grew last month at the slowest pace since September.  Canadian Natural Resources slumped 3 percent to C$31.09 and
Cenovus lost 2.3 percent to C$32. Crude for April delivery
tumbled 1.1 percent to $89.69, the third straight day of
declines.  Agrium lost C$2.25 to C$105.06 after Victor Zaleschuk,
chairman of the Calgary-based company, sent a letter to
shareholders asking them to re-elect the existing board at the
seed and fertilizer supplier’s annual general meeting on April
9.  He called an opposing slate from New York-based hedge fund
Jana Partners LLC “a Trojan horse tactic” designed to break up
Agrium. Jana has pressed the company to spin off its farm-supply
retail network.  Atlantic Power  Atlantic Power Corp. (ATP)  plunged 15 percent to C$6.18,
extending a 29 percent decline on Mar. 1 after the electric
power company cut its annual  dividend  65 percent to 40 Canadian
cents a share. The stock touched its lowest level since November
2008.  “Even after a 29 percent share price decline, we believe
it is too early for value investors to step in,” said Nelson Ng, analyst with RBC Capital Markets.  Aurizon added 18 Canadian cents to C$4.53. The cash-and-
stock offer from U.S.-based Hecla Mining, which operates silver
mines in Alaska and Idaho, comes after Aurizon rejected on Jan.
