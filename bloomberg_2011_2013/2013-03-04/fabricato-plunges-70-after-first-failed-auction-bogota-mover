Fabricato SA sank 70 percent after
the stock exchange auctioned off some of the Colombian textile
maker’s shares following a three-month suspension of the stock.  Fabricato posted its biggest one-day decline, tumbling to
21 pesos in Bogota today, three days after the exchange failed
to draw bids for the shares at a higher price range it set.  Regulators suspended trading of Fabricato on Nov. 16 as the
collapse of the brokerage Interbolsa SA, which was backing a bid
to take control of the Medellin-based company, sent the stock
plunging 21 percent to 72 pesos. Investment bank SBI Banca de
Inversion SA had estimated that the shares could have a value of
35 pesos to 55 pesos when trading was renewed.  “The market clearly didn’t take the valuation report as a
reference,” said Valeria Marconi, an equity analyst at Correval
SA brokerage in Bogota. “Added to poor earnings results,
investors are getting rid” of the shares.  Clients of Interbolsa, which is being liquidated by the
Colombian government, were left with the shares after the firm
defaulted on its debt and didn’t pay back loans secured by the
textile company’s stock.  “I don’t see much upside from here,” said Marconi. “If
anything, we’ll see more selling pressure.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
