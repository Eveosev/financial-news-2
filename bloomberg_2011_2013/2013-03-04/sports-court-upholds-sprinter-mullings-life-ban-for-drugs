Former world champion sprinter Steve
Mullings remains banned for life after the Court of Arbitration
for Sport dismissed his appeal.  The Jamaican was suspended for two years by his country’s
anti-doping authority in 2004 after testing positive for the
anabolic steroid methyltestosterone. In 2011, an in-competition
test during the national senior championships in  Jamaica  found
he’d taken furosemide, a banned diuretic. That led to a life ban
that he appealed in December 2011.  Mullings argued that “there were problems with the 2004
positive test meaning that it should not be counted as a first
sanction for a doping offense,” CAS said. Mullings further said
that the 2011 tests were “unreliable and that the disciplinary
proceedings were flawed.”  CAS today said that it had found that Mullings “had not
presented any basis to challenge the testing procedure of the
2011 sample.” In addition, the Lausanne, Switzerland-based
court “did not find that the circumstances surrounding the
first offense did warrant a more lenient sanction.”  Mullings helped Jamaica win the 400-meter relay gold
alongside Olympic champion Usain Bolt at the 2009 world
championships.  To contact the reporter on this story:
