Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said the Federal Open Market Committee won’t begin to
shrink the Fed’s record balance sheet until after it starts
raising the benchmark  interest rate .  “The committee has made very clear that it intends to hold
on its balance sheet all the assets we acquire in this purchase
program until after we begin raising the  federal funds rate ,”
Yellen said today in Washington. “The committee’s intention is
to leave that accommodation in place until well into the
recovery.”  Yellen, the Fed’s No. 2 official, affirmed the sequence of
steps in the central bank’s strategy to normalize its policy,
which was adopted in June 2011.  She also reiterated the Fed’s commitment not to raise its
target rate if inflation is “well-behaved” and unemployment
still above 6.5 percent, and said “we would not consider
selling assets off until after the federal funds rate has
increased.”  Yellen spoke to the National Association for Business
Economics annual policy conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
