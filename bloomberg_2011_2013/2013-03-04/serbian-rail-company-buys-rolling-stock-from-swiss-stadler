Zeleznice Srbije,  Serbia ’s state-
owned railway monopoly, agreed to buy 21 electrical trains from
Stadler Bussnang AG, a Swiss-German maker of rolling stock and a
unit of Stadler Rail AG.  The 99 million-euro ($129 million) purchase is partly
financed by a loan from the  European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development , said Dragoljub Simonovic, chief executive officer
of the Belgrade-based Zeleznice Srbije, after he signed the
contract today.  The  trains , due for delivery between September 2014 and
August 2015, will “to a great extent meet the need for
intercity passenger traffic” in Serbia, Simonovic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
