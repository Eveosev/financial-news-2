German stocks  declined for a second
day as  China ’s services industries expanded at the slowest pace
in five months, adding to signs a recovery in the world’s
second-biggest economy is moderating.  K+S AG (SDF)  dropped 1.4 percent as Bank of America Corp.
downgraded the shares. Baader Bank AG surged to its highest
level in more than nine months after reporting a profit for 2012
and projecting growth this year.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  retreated 0.2 percent to 7,691.68 at the
close of trading in  Frankfurt . The gauge has still added 1
percent so far this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a budget
avoiding automatic fiscal changes that had threatened to push
the world’s biggest economy into a recession. The broader HDAX
Index also lost 0.2 percent today.  “If we look at the latest statistics for services and
manufacturing, the Chinese economy is slowing down,” Ion Marc Valahu, co-founder and  fund manager  at Clairinvest in Geneva,
wrote in a message. “A further tightening in monetary policy
risks taking down growth further. The horizon in  Europe  is
getting cloudier by the day, but so far, investors seem to use
pullbacks to add to positions.”  The volume of shares changing hands on the DAX was 34
percent less than the average over the past 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese Services  China’s services industries expanded last month at the
slowest pace since September. The non-manufacturing  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index fell to 54.5 in February from 56.2 in January,
the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  The Chinese government has also intensified its three-year
campaign to cool the real estate market, ordering larger
deposits and stricter enforcement of sales taxes.  In  Italy , Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani’s
economic policy spokesman, Stefano Fassina, said the country may
have to hold new elections “in a few months” if Bersani fails
to build a majority in the Senate.  K+S lost 50 cents to 35.47 euros as Bank of America Corp.
downgraded the stock to underperform, the equivalent of a sell
rating, from neutral.  Europe’s biggest potash distributor has limited capacity
for growth until its unit in Canada ramps up production in 2015,
according to Bank of America, which predicted that 2013 capital
expenditure will rise to 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion).  Metro AG (MEO)  retreated 6.2 percent to 21.14 euros as Citigroup
Inc. cut its forecast price for  Germany ’s largest retailer to 15
euros from 19 euros, reiterating a sell recommendation. The
shares slid on Friday after Metro cut its full-year dividend 26
percent and reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Carmakers Decline  Volkswagen AG fell 0.9 percent to 162.55 euros as a report
from the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt showed new car registrations in
Germany fell 10.5 percent in February from a year earlier. The
number of new Volkswagen cars registered declined 14.6 percent.  Daimler AG, the third-largest maker of luxury cars, slid
1.5 percent to 44.99 euros. A gauge of European carmakers was
among the biggest fallers in the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Deutsche Bank AG, Germany’s largest lender, retreated 1.3
percent to 33.15 euros, following a measure of European banks
lower.  Baader Bank (BWB)  advanced 5.8 percent to 2.20 euros, its highest
price since May 14, as it reported profit after taxes of 8.8
million euros for 2012 and forecast growth in 2013 and 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
