Telecom Italia Media SpA (TME)  agreed to
sell its La7 television unit to  Cairo Communication SpA (CAI)  for 1
million euros ($1.3 million), rejecting a rival offer from a
private-equity fund led by Claudio Sposito.  The television company will be recapitalized before the
sale and  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , the controlling investor in Telecom
Italia Media, agreed to waive 100 million euros of receivables
owed by its media unit, according to a stock-exchange statement.
The capital injection will allow La7 to have shareholder equity
of 138 million euros.  While La7’s losses totalled about 1 billion euros in the
past decade, the network’s programming gained market share in
the last three years after it attracted prominent Italian TV
journalists Enrico Mentana and Gad Lerner. The sale excludes
La7’s 51 percent interest in MTV Italia.  Cairo Communication, founded by Urbano Cairo, was picked
last month for exclusive talks with Telecom Italia,  Italy ’s
biggest phone company. Cairo is a former aide to ex-premier
Silvio Berlusconi.  Clessidra SGR SpA, the private-equity fund led by Sposito,
had made an offer for Telecom Italia Media assets, including
some infrastructure, valued at about 300 million euros ($390
million), according to a person familiar with the matter, who
asked not to be identified because the details of the bid were
confidential.  Telecom Media’s board also approved the company’s new
business plan for 2013 to 2015, which targets an annual average
revenue increase of 11 percent. It’s aiming for an annual
average rise of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of 36 percent.  The company reported a 2012 net loss of 240.9 million
euros. Telecom Italia Media fell 6.4 percent to 15.7 cents in
Milan, giving it a market value of 228.4 million euros. Telecom
Italia was little changed at 54.6 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
