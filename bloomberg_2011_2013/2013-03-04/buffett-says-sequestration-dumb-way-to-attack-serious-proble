Warren Buffett , the billionaire
chairman and chief executive officer of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ,
said U.S. federal spending cuts known as sequestration are a
“meat-axe” approach to reducing the deficit.  “It’s a very dumb way of attacking a very serious
problem,” Buffett said in an interview today on CNBC. “The
deficit is going to come down and it needs to come down and it
will come down, and we may be doing it in a meat-ax way in this
particular move.”  Editor: Dan Kraut  To contact the reporter on this story:
