Stocks in  Switzerland  declined, with
the benchmark Swiss Market Index snapping three days of gains,
after China tightened mortgage rules to rein in real-estate
prices.  Kuehne & Nagel (KNIN)  International AG, the world’s biggest sea-
freight forwarder, fell the most in more than 10 months as full-
year net income missed estimates.  Transocean (RIGN)  Ltd., the largest
offshore rig contractor, advanced after posting a fourth-quarter
profit for the first time in three years.  The  SMI (SMI)  dropped 0.2 percent to 7,585.45 at 9:35 a.m., after
rising 0.6 percent last week. The measure has rallied for six
consecutive months, its longest streak of monthly gains since
2009. The broader Swiss Performance Index also retreated 0.3
percent today.  The number of shares trading hands on SMI-listed companies
was 23 percent higher than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In China, the government intensified a three-year campaign
to cool the real estate market, ordering larger deposits and
stricter enforcement of sales taxes.  The People’s Bank of China’s regional branches may
implement the measures in accordance with the price-control
targets of local governments,  China ’s cabinet said in a
statement on its website. Cities facing the most pressure from
rising house prices must further tighten limits on buying
property, according to the statement.  Chinese Industry  Separately, the non-manufacturing purchasing managers’
index for the world’s second-largest economy fell to 54.5 in
February from 56.2 in January, the National Bureau of Statistics
and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in a
statement yesterday.  Kuehne & Nagel slid 4.4 percent to 101.30 Swiss francs, the
biggest drop since April. Net income of 485 million francs ($515
million) for 2012 missed the average analyst estimate that
called for 523 million francs. The company also said Chief
Executive Officer Reinhard Lange will step down for health
reasons.  “Results fail to convince us,”  Michael Foeth , an analyst
at Vontobel Holding AG, wrote in a note to clients. “CEO
transition remains an issue.”  Transocean climbed 2.3 percent to 49.70 francs. Net income
was $456 million, or $1.19 a share, compared with a loss of
$6.17 billion, or $18.67, a year earlier. Excluding a $101
million tax benefit, per-share profit was 9 cents more than the
average of 35 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company also said it recommends a dividend of $2.24 a
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
