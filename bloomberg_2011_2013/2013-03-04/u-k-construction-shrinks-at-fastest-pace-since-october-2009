U.K.  construction  shrank the most in
more than three years in February as commercial and civil
engineering work declined, Markit Economics said.  An index of activity fell to 46.8 from 48.7 in January,
Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said
in an e-mailed report today in  London . That’s the lowest since
October 2009 and below economists’ forecast for a reading of 49,
based on the median of nine estimates. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  The construction report follows a survey by Markit last
week that showed manufacturing unexpectedly shrank in February,
reviving concerns the economy could shrink again this quarter.
Services growth probably slowed last month, economists said
before another report tomorrow.  “There is barely a crumb of comfort in this month’s
figures for the construction industry,” said CIPS Chief
Executive Officer David Noble. They are “disappointing to say
the least and with little in sight to improve the sector’s
fortunes.”  Bank of England policy makers begin their monthly two-day
meeting on March 6 and will keep their  bond-purchase target 
unchanged, according to the median of 39 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. They also left the target on hold last month,
when they discussed new measures to revive growth.  Commercial construction shrank at the steepest pace for
more than three years, while the reduction in work on civil
engineering projects was the fastest since October 2009, Markit
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
