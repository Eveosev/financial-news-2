U.S.  stocks  rose, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest level since 2007, as speculation the  Federal Reserve  will continue stimulus measures overshadowed concern over spending cuts and  China’s economy .  Airlines rallied while industrial and energy stocks fell as oil dropped to its lowest level since December.  Yahoo! (YHOO)  Inc. jumped 3.5 percent after an analyst at Barclays Plc raised his rating on the company. Homebuilders advanced as D.R. Horton Inc. and Ryland Group Inc. rose at least 3.2 percent.  Google Inc. (GOOG)  jumped 1.9 percent to a record, while  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  retreated 2.4 percent to its lowest level in more than a year.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent to 1,525.20 at 4 p.m. in  New York , after falling as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 38.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 14,127.82, its highest level since October 2007. About 6 billion shares exchanged hands on U.S. exchanges today, 4.4 percent below the three-month average.  “Excluding this quarter, which will be impacted by the sequester, the economy probably strengthens as the year goes on,” Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Boston-based Fiduciary Trust Co., which manages $9.5 billion, said by telephone. “The Fed is going to be our friend for an extended period of time, and as the old adage goes, don’t fight the Fed.”  The  bull market  in U.S. equities is entering its fifth year this month after the S&P 500 surged 124 percent from a 12-year low in 2009 amid better-than-estimated corporate earnings and three rounds of bond purchases by the Fed to keep  interest rates  low and stimulate the economy. The S&P 500 has climbed 6.9 percent this year and is trading at 2.6 percent below its record of 1,565.15 reached in October 2007. The Dow is less than 0.3 percent from its high of 14,164.53.  Fed Stimulus  Stocks rose as Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said the U.S. central bank should press on with $85 billion in monthly bond buying while tracking possible costs and risks from the unprecedented program.  “Turning to the potential costs of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, there are some that definitely need to be monitored over time,” Yellen said today in a speech in  Washington . “At this stage, I do not see any that would cause me to advocate a curtailment of our purchase program.”  Equities fell early in the trading day as  China ’s  services industries  expanded last month at the slowest pace since September. The non-manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index fell to 54.5 in February from 56.2 in January, the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Budget Cuts  Automatic cuts in U.S. federal spending, half of which are in defense programs, went into effect March 1 following a congressional impasse. The government will reduce spending by $1.2 trillion over the next nine years, including $85 billion in this fiscal year. The budget cuts, known as sequestration, will cause a 0.6 percentage-point reduction in economic growth this year, the  Congressional Budget Office  has estimated.  Even as President  Barack Obama  phoned Democratic and Republican legislators over the weekend, Obama’s aides and congressional leaders signaled the budget reductions would continue for weeks, possibly months.  Both sides indicated that revisiting the reductions would begin after they resolve a confrontation over legislation that’s needed to keep federal agencies running beyond March 27, placing a premium on avoiding a government shutdown.

Warren Buffett , who built Berkshire Hathaway Inc. into a $250 billion company with funds from insurance units, said in his annual letter to shareholders on March 1 that low interest rates create “dim prospects” for the industry that fueled his firm’s growth.  The billionaire also said other CEOs who held back investment last year because of doubts about the economy missed an opportunity. The future of the U.S. has been uncertain since the country’s Declaration of Independence in 1776, he wrote.  “American business will do fine over time. And stocks will do well just as certainly,” Buffett said. “Since the basic game is so favorable, Charlie and I believe it’s a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out of it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of ‘experts,’ or the ebb and flow of business activity. The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it,” he said, referring to Vice Chairman Charles Munger.
