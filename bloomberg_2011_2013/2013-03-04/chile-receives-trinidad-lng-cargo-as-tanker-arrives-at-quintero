Chile was scheduled to receive a
cargo of liquefied natural gas from  Trinidad & Tobago , according
to ship-tracking data.  The Celestine River, with a capacity of 145,394 cubic
meters, arrived yesterday at the port of Quintero on Chile’s
central coast, according to ship transmissions captured by  IHS
Inc. (IHS)  on Bloomberg. The tanker sailed from the Point Fortin LNG
terminal in Trinidad & Tobago where it loaded its cargo and
departed Feb. 13.  Chile has a contract to import 1.7 million metric tons of
LNG annually from BG Plc that started in 2009 and ends in 2030
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We don’t comment on individual shipments as these
arrangements are confidential between supplier and customer,”
Damien Bird, a BG spokesman in Singapore, said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
