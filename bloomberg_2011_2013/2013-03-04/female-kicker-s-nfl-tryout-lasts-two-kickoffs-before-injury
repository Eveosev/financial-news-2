Lauren Silberman, the first woman to
participate in a National Football League regional tryout,
attempted just two kickoffs yesterday before her audition was
ended by a quadriceps injury.  Silberman, a 28-year-old New York City resident who played
club soccer at the  University of Wisconsin , said she aggravated
an injury she suffered last week while training. Her first two
kicks at the  New York Jets ’ training complex in  Florham Park ,
New Jersey, traveled 19 yards and 13 yards,  NFL.com reported .  “It was a frustrating day because I wanted to show the
world how well I could kick,” Silberman, who met with trainers
after her second kick, was cited as saying by NFL.com. “I kept
trying to work through it, but between the pain and the risk of
further injury, I thought it was best to stop.”  The NFL holds 11 so-called regional combines through
January and April to supplement the league’s national scouting
combine and provide an opportunity for players to display their
skills before NFL talent evaluators. St. Louis Rams kicker Greg
Zuerlein was among the four players drafted after attending the
NFL’s 2012 regional combines, while another 83 were signed as
free agents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
