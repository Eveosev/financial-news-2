CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  is set to rebound
from its biggest monthly plunge since May on speculation the
Russian television company will report record sales as its
audience increases, according to UralSib Financial Corp.  American depositary receipts of CTC added 0.5 percent to
$9.75 in New York yesterday, following a 9.4 percent tumble in
February. The shares led gains on the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian companies in New York. The
measure dropped 0.8 percent to 99.22, led by OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  and  OAO
RusHydro. (RSHYY)  RTS stock index  futures  rose 0.7 percent to 150,480 in
U.S. hours.  CTC will probably report tomorrow that fourth-quarter sales
grew  8 percent  to $256 million, according to the mean estimate
of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the
highest since at least 2006, when the Moscow-based company held
its initial public offering in New York. CTC TV has regained its
position as Russia’s fourth most-watched channel this year after
debuting new shows aimed at younger viewers including ‘Boarding
School,’ ‘The Eighties’ and ‘Kitchen.’  “CTC has shown a turnaround as audience increased,”
Konstantin Belov, an analyst at UralSib Financial, said by phone
from Moscow yesterday. “Their content was an answer to what the
viewers really wanted.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, fell 1.2 percent to $28.47 in New
York yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 6. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the  stock
futures , fell 4.6 percent to 22.56.  Audience Share  CTC TV, the source of 62 percent of the company’s revenue
in 2011, increased its  audience share  of viewers aged 6 to 54
years to 9.4 percent in the fourth quarter, after two
consecutive quarters of declines, the company said on its
website, citing TNS Global data.  “Market participants expect the company to explain how it
plans to increase its audience further,” Alexander Vengranovich, an analyst at Otkritie Capital, said by phone from
Moscow yesterday. “They could win a much bigger audience share
if they decide to go with digital broadcasts, but there is also
a risk of higher spending as digital broadcasts cost more.”  CTC Media won digital TV licenses for its Domashny and CTC
channels in December as  Russia  seeks to fully switch over to the
technology by 2015.  Total spending on Russian TV ads is expected to increase
about 10 percent in the ruble terms in 2013 from 2012, UralSib’s
Belov and Otkritie’s Vengranovich said yesterday.  Vengranovich
rates CTC a hold, with a price target of $11.80 per share.
UralSib rates the shares a buy, with a target price of $13 per
share.  Market Growth  Proceeds from advertising accounted for more than 97
percent of company revenue in 2011, the highest level since
2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Russian TV ad market is expected to grow to  $5.9
billion  in 2014, making it the biggest in  Europe , from $4.4
billion in 2011, CTC said on its website, citing estimates by
industry think-tanks, including Zenith Optimedia and Video
International.  Net income in the fourth quarter probably reached $62.8
million following a loss of $24.5 million in the last three
months of 2011, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  RusHydro, Russia’s state-run hydropower producer, fell 3.8
percent to $2.15 in New York yesterday, the lowest level on
record.  Mechel (MTL) , the nation’s biggest maker of steelmaking coal,
decreased 3.5 percent to $5.24, the lowest level since April
2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Crude Oil  Crude for April delivery fell 0.6 percent to $90.12 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the lowest
settlement since Dec. 24. It sank below $90 a barrel for the
first time in 2013 yesterday.  Brent oil for February settlement decreased 0.3 percent to
$110.09 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, while  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export blend, fell
0.4 percent to $106.94, the highest level since Dec. 13.  The ruble weakened 0.1 percent against the dollar-euro
basket to 34.9161. The currency lost 0.1 percent to 30.7340 per
dollar after plunging 1.8 percent in Moscow last month, its
worst performance since May. Ruble futures show the currency
strengthening 0.2 percent to 30.804 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
