Indonesia’s rupiah weakened by the
most in almost three weeks after a report showed inflation
unexpectedly accelerated.  Government bonds  advanced.  Consumer-price gains were  5.31 percent  last month, the
fastest pace since June 2011, according to official data
published on March 1. That compares with the 4.81 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The central bank needs to remain
alert and monitor future trends, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono
said in a mobile-phone text message the same day. Bank Indonesia
on Feb. 12 forecast inflation will be in a 3.5 percent to 5.5
percent range this year.  The rupiah declined 0.3 percent to 9,704 per dollar as of
9:12 a.m. in Jakarta, the biggest drop since Feb. 12, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It traded at a 0.2
percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which
were steady at 9,727, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The rupiah weakened due to the inflation rate, which is a
concern as it erodes purchasing power,” said Fahrudin Haris
Prastowo, a foreign-exchange trader at PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia.
“ Bank Indonesia  will likely maintain the  reference rate  when it
meets this week as inflation has not breached its assumption.”  Bank Indonesia will meet on March 7 to decide on its policy
rate after it held borrowing costs steady for a 12th month at a
record-low 5.75 percent in February.  A daily  fixing  used to settle rupiah derivatives was set at
9,681 on March 1, from 9,669 the previous day, by the
Association of Banks in  Singapore . One-month implied volatility
in the rupiah, which measures expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.85 percent.  The government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 snapped
four days of losses, prompting the yield to drop one basis point
today to 5.37 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
