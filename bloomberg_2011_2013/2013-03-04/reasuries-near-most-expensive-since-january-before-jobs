Treasuries were the most expensive
since January before a report this week economists said will
show the U.S. labor market is falling short of what the Federal
Reserve wants.  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for interest rates, growth and inflation, was
negative 0.76 percent. It was the lowest level since Jan. 16.
Negative  readings  indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value. The U.S. jobless rate
held at 7.9 percent, economists said before the March 8 report,
giving the Federal Reserve reason to maintain its $85 billion
monthly bond purchases.  “If unemployment stays at 7.9 percent, we’ll ratchet down
to lower rates,” said Ali Jalai, who trades U.S. debt in
Singapore at Scotiabank, a unit of  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , one of
the 21 primary dealers that underwrite the U.S. debt. “The
Fed’s not changing because the economy’s not improving a lot.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  were little changed today at 1.84
percent at 7:25 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader data. The price of the 2 percent note due February 2023
was 101 15/32.  Japan ’s five-year rate slid to 0.095 percent, extending its
decline to record lows. The 10-year Japanese government bond
yield sank to 0.6 percent, the least since June 2003.  The U.S. probably added 160,000 workers last month, after
employment rose by 157,000 in January, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the
Labor Department report on March 8. The  jobless rate  has
averaged 6 percent over the past 20 years.  Yield Scenarios  A gain of 150,000 to 160,000 jobs along with 7.9 percent
unemployment will send 10-year yields down to 1.75 percent over
the coming month, Jalai said. A gain of 200,000 positions will
push yields up to 2 percent, he said.  Growth in China services and manufacturing ebbed,
underscoring demand for the relative safety of debt. Expansion
in Chinese industries including retailing, transport and banking
was the slowest in five months in February, an official survey
of purchasing managers showed yesterday. Gauges released two
days earlier pointed to manufacturing growth cooling.  The Fed probably will continue buying $40 billion of
mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion of Treasuries a month
though the end of the year or into 2014’s first quarter, said
Russell Price, a senior economist at  Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP) 
in  Detroit . Price was the most accurate forecaster of monthly
employment gains for the two years ended in December, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Fed is scooping up bonds to
spur the economy by putting downward pressure on interest rates.  Stronger Economy  The U.S. economy is stronger than it was a year ago, which
means investors should avoid Treasuries, said Hiroki Shimazu, an
economist in  Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., a unit of
Japan’s second-largest publicly traded bank.  The  jobless rate  has fallen from 8.3 percent, while
American  factories  expanded in February at the fastest pace in
almost two years.  “The Treasury market is not attractive,” Shimazu said.
“Equities, real estate and commodities are more attractive.”  Ten-year yields will fall to 1.83 percent by March 31 and
then rise to 2.28 percent by year-end, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists, with the most recent projections given the
heaviest weightings.  U.S. government securities dropped 0.3 percent this year as
of March after accounting for interest payments, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The  MSCI All-Country
World Index (MXWD)  of stocks returned 4.3 percent.  Italy, Budget  S&P/Case-Shiller’s index of home prices  in 20 U.S. cities
rose in the 12 months through December by the most since July
2006. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of
commodities has lost 1.2 percent in 2013.  U.S. government securities were also supported by elections
in  Italy  last week that cast doubt on the stability of the next
government.  Automatic U.S. spending cuts that began March 1 in the U.S.
may lower gross domestic product by 0.6 percentage point and
cost 750,000 jobs by the end of 2013, according to the
 Congressional Budget Office . The cuts total $1.2 trillion over
nine years, with $85 billion scheduled to take place in the
remaining seven months of this fiscal year.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE Index, which tracks
the outlook for swings in U.S. government debt rates, shows
investors don’t anticipate an increase in price swings.  The index, which measures volatility based on prices of
over-the-counter options on Treasuries maturing in 2 to 30
years, ended last week at 55. The average is about 100 since the
beginning of 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
