Outdoor Channel Holdings Inc. (OUTD) , the
owner of a cable-TV network with hunting and fishing programs,
said it received an unsolicited $227 million takeover bid from
Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC.  The $8.75-a-share cash offer appears to be superior to the
TV-network company’s previously announced plan to merge with
InterMedia Outdoor Holdings Inc., Outdoor Channel said today in
a statement. The board has authorized talks with Kroenke, it
said.  The new offer may thwart closely held InterMedia’s plan to
produce a new publicly traded company combining its Sportsman
Channel and 15 magazines with Outdoor Channel. InterMedia had
offered Outdoor Channel investors a choice of $8 cash a share, a
new share of the new company or a combination of $4.46 in cash
and 0.443 share.  InterMedia said today in a statement that Kroenke’s bid
isn’t a superior offer, based on the value of comparable
companies and the savings InterMedia would get by combining with
Outdoor Channel.  Outdoor Channel, based in Temecula,  California , rose 15
percent to $8.65 at the close in New York.  Closely held Kroenke, based in Denver, owns and operates
the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association and
the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League, in
addition to the Pepsi Center, where both teams play, and other
sports teams and venues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
