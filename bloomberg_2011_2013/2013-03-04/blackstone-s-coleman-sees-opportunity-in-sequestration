Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s head of
restructuring and reorganization said across-the-board spending
cuts by the federal government will hamper corporate growth and
increase investment uncertainty, giving his unit more
opportunities to advise struggling companies.  “To my business it probably means there is going to be
some future opportunity,” Tim Coleman said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers” with  Erik
Schatzker  and Stephanie Ruhle. Coleman said 750,000 jobs could
be lost if sequestration, the U.S. federal spending cuts that
went into effect March 1, continues without a resolution between
congressional Democrats and Republicans.  President  Barack Obama  and the Democrats say they want a
“balanced” approach including higher tax revenue as well as
spending cuts. Republicans say they won’t agree to higher tax
revenue after Congress voted Jan. 1 to raise tax rates on top
incomes. The two sides have yet to reach a deal.  “If you are concerned about where the economy is going and
what’s going to happen in our world, you’re not going to go buy
a new company or build a new plant,” said Coleman. “You’ll cut
your capital-expenditures budget. We’ve been very busy over the
past year because not every company is able to grow beyond its
balance sheet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
