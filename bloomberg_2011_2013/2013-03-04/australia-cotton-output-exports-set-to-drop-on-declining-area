Cotton production in  Australia , set
to be the world’s third-biggest shipper, may drop for a second
season next fiscal year, curbing supplies for export, according
to a government commodity forecaster.  Output may reach 905,000 metric tons in the year starting
July 1, from 945,000 tons a year earlier, the  Australian Bureau 
of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said in a
report today. Exports may drop to 924,000 tons, from a record
1.1 million tons a year earlier, Canberra-based Abares said.  Declining output in Australia will curb global supplies,
helping extend the fiber’s 34 percent rally since dropping to a
31-month low on June 4 on signs of lower global output and
rising demand. Prices rose for a fifth day yesterday, reaching
the highest since May. Global production will drop 7.3 percent
in the year starting Aug. 1 as world consumption climbs 2.1
percent, Cotlook Inc. said Feb. 21  Australian farmers may sow 434,000 hectares of cotton in
2013-2014 from 442,000 hectares a year earlier, Abares said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
