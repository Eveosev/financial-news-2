A lack of cargoes is limiting the
market to ship liquefied natural gas as production needs to
resume in  Nigeria  and start in  Angola  for rates to increase,
according to RS Platou Markets AS.  A force majeure declaration in Nigeria cut demand for 10
vessels,  Egypt  is reducing cargoes to eight this year from as
many as 70, and maintenance in  Norway  is removing about 70 more
cargoes a year, Herman Hildan, an Oslo-based analyst at the
investment-banking unit of Norway’s largest shipbroker, said in
an e-mailed report today. A new facility in Angola expected to
supply as many as 90 cargoes a year is delayed, with the seven
vessels dedicated to the project adding to competition for spot
cargoes, he said.  “Low cargo availability is dampening the spot market
currently,” Hildan said. “High global gas price spreads
strongly incentivize inter-basin trade, however, for  spot market 
LNG rates to strengthen we believe the key is normalization of
Nigerian production by mid-March as some industry sources expect
and successful startup in Angola during the summer.”  Beyond this year, exports from the U.S. may require as many
as 200 more vessels, compared with the current fleet of 380,
according to the report. The U.S. Department of Energy is
considering 16 applications to export LNG equal to 50 percent of
current annual trade, Platou estimates. A December study showed
exports would benefit the economy, and the government said it
would decide on the applications after taking responses through
Feb. 25, Hildan said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
