Kuwait posted a preliminary  budget
surplus  of 16.1 billion dinars ($56.7 billion) in the first nine
months of the fiscal year ending March 31,  National Bank of
Kuwait  SAK said, citing official data.  “The surplus, equivalent to 33 percent of annual 2012 GDP,
was lifted by a combination of soaring revenues and
comparatively softer spending growth,” Kuwait’s biggest bank
said in an e-mailed report today.  Revenue was 24.3 billion dinars, including oil revenue of
22.8 billion dinars, up 13 percent from a year ago, NBK said.
Spending was 8.2 billion dinars.  Capital spending  was 0.7
billion dinars.  Spending is “well below” the historical average for this
time of year, while investment spending “has stayed relatively
subdued,” the bank said. NBK projects a surplus this year of 14
billion dinars.  Kuwait posted a record budget surplus of 13.2 billion
dinars in the 2011-2012 fiscal year as  oil prices  and output
rose.  The 2012-2013 budget projects spending of 21.2 billion
dinars and revenue of 13.9 billion dinars. The government said
it will raise revenue allocations to its Future Generations Fund
wealth fund this fiscal year to 25 percent from 10 percent to
“encourage saving.”  Kuwait is the third-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
