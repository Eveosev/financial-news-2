The decade-long probe into  Iran ’s
nuclear program and safety in the wake of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
reactor meltdowns are among the topics to be discussed at an
International Atomic Energy Agency meeting this week.  The IAEA’s 35-member board of governors convenes in Vienna
today for its quarterly session. The meeting comes less than a
week after diplomats adjourned a two-day round of talks about
Iran’s nuclear work on Feb. 27 in Almaty,  Kazakhstan .  Inspectors from the IAEA reported Feb. 21 that while Iran
rolled out new atomic technology and boosted its output of
enriched uranium, the Persian Gulf country hadn’t diverted any
of its stockpile to non-peaceful purposes. Iran, under dozens of
international sanctions for alleged atomic-weapons work,
maintains its nuclear program is solely for generating energy.  IAEA governors, who are meeting all week, will also follow
up on nuclear-safety improvements prescribed after a March 11,
2011, tsunami caused the meltdown of three nuclear reactors in
Fukushima,  Japan . Girls exposed to radiation near Tokyo Electric
Power Co.’s damaged plant have as much as a 70 percent increased
risk of developing thyroid cancer in their lifetimes, the  World
Health Organization  said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
