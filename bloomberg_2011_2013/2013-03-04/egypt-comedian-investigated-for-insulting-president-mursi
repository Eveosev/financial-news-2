Egypt ’s prosecutor-general has
ordered an investigation of television comedian Bassem Youssef,
following a complaint alleging he insulted President Mohamed Mursi during his satirical program.  The complaint accused Youssef of ridiculing and insulting
Mursi by parodying parts of his Feb. 25 interview on the Mehwar
satellite channel and suggesting he be awarded an Oscar as best
actor, according to an e-mailed statement today.  The lawsuit is the latest of several to be filed against
media personalities in what secularists fear is an assault on
freedom of expression and the press under Mursi’s Islamist
government.  The complaint was filed on behalf of 12 citizens who said
they were “psychologically hurt” by the reference to the
president.  Youssef, a doctor, rose to fame shortly after the 2011
uprising that pushed  Hosni Mubarak  from power with a satirical
video posted on YouTube. Known for mocking ultraconservative
Islamists, Youssef’s show is largely modeled on  Jon Stewart ’s
“The Daily Show,” on which he has appeared.  To contact the reporter on this story:
