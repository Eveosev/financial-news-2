Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s
biggest defense contractor, beat  Boeing Co. (BA)  and  Raytheon Co. (RTN) , to
retain its role as primary systems engineer for the Navy’s Aegis
weapons system, the Pentagon said today.  For the short-term, Lockheed Martin’s Moorestown, New
Jersey-based Mission Systems and Training unit received a cost-
plus incentive fee contract valued at as much as $100 million,
of which $2.9 million will be obligated today, the Pentagon said
in its daily list of contracts.  The Aegis program is the U.S. Navy’s primary system for
detecting and intercepting threats to surface ships. Chicago-
based Boeing and Raytheon, based in Waltham, Massachusetts,
submitted bids in 2011.  Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Maryland, will modernize the
current system and maintain it on future CG 47-class cruisers
and DDG-51-class destroyers and any new Aegis class ship, the
Pentagon said.  A victory by Boeing or Raytheon to become the new systems
integrator would have broken a 40-year lock on the program by
Lockheed and predecessors, according to the  Congressional
Research Service . Several companies that were acquired by
Lockheed inherited the contract since the 1970s through mergers
and acquisitions.  Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing Strategic Missile &
Defense Systems, said in an e-mailed statement that while the
decision “is a disappointment, we remain committed to
supporting the U.S. Navy’s ballistic defense mission,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
