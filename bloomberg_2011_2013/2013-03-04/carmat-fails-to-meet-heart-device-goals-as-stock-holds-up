Carmat SAS (ALCAR)  surged as much as 8.3
percent after the French medical-device maker said it’s close to
the first test of its experimental artificial heart on a human.  The  stock  jumped as much as 9.50 euros to 124.50 euros, the
steepest intraday gain since Feb. 1. The shares traded 7.3
percent higher at 123.43 euros as of 10:28 a.m., giving the
Velizy-Villacoublay-based company a market value of 510 million
euros ($663 million). The shares have soared more than sixfold
since the company’s 2010 stock sale.  Carmat has completed the training of the surgical teams
that will implant the device, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today. Several centers are ready to carry out the
procedure, it added. Carmat’s heart is being developed to
counter the low number of organs available for a transplant.  The French device maker “has the financial means to carry
out multiple implants,” Chief Executive Officer Marcello Conviti said in the statement. “We are now very close to
launching the clinical phase in  Europe .”  Carmat is still awaiting a nod from French health
authorities for the trial. The company needs to provide extra
information to the  National Medicine Security Agency  before the
regulator, better known as the ANSM, can authorize the first
test, Axelle de Franssu, a spokeswoman for the agency, said
March 1 by phone. The ANSM currently has “‘no visibility’’ on
the timing of a possible decision on Carmat’s artificial heart,
she said.  Heart Attacks  An estimated 17.3 million people died from  cardiovascular
disease  worldwide in 2008 and that number may rise to almost
23.3 million by 2030, according to the Geneva-based  World Health
Organization .  Each year there are more than 100,000 patients awaiting
cardiac transplantation, and less than 4,000 organs are
available for the procedure, according to the company’s  website .
Carmat’s founder, cardiac surgeon Alain Carpentier, has
successfully developed  heart valves .  Carmat also said today it’s continuing to produce data for
the file registered with the ANSM. So far all of the tests on
animals were ‘‘satisfactorily” carried out, Carmat said. The
company has also set up a clinical trial program in other
countries, it added.  Carmat said its 2012 loss widened to 17.2 million euros,
from 13.4 million euros the previous year. As of Dec. 31, it had
11.1 million euros of cash. The company said it has resources to
finance itself through 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
