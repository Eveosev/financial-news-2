Stocks in Switzerland  declined, with
the benchmark Swiss Market Index snapping three days of gains,
as growth in  China ’s services industry slowed.  Kuehne & Nagel International AG, the world’s biggest sea-
freight forwarder, fell to the lowest price since July as full-
year net income missed estimates. Transocean Ltd., the largest
offshore rig contractor, advanced after posting a fourth-quarter
profit for the first time in three years.  The  SMI (SMI)  dropped 0.2 percent to 7,590.52 at the close of
trading in Zurich after rising 0.6 percent last week. The
benchmark measure has rallied for six consecutive months, its
longest streak of monthly gains since 2009. The broader Swiss
Performance Index retreated 0.2 percent today.  “The news from China looked more dramatic in terms of its
impact on Asian stocks,” Alessandro Fezzi, senior market
analyst at LGT Bank Schweiz AG in Zurich. “Swiss stocks have
shown some resistance but the overall news from China is still
having a negative impact on the market.”  China’s services industries expanded last month at the
slowest pace since September. The non-manufacturing  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index fell to 54.5 in February from 56.2 in January,
the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Chinese Mortgages  The Chinese government intensified its three-year campaign
to cool the real estate market, ordering larger deposits and
stricter enforcement of sales taxes.  “The property curbs in China were an unexpected move,”
Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG in  London , said in a
telephone interview. “But it could be something of an admission
that the  property market  in China is more buoyant than
previously thought.”  Kuehne & Nagel slid 0.9 percent to 105 Swiss francs. Net
income of 485 million francs ($515 million) for 2012 missed the
average analyst estimate that called for 523 million francs. The
company also said Chief Executive Officer Reinhard Lange will
step down for health reasons.  “Results fail to convince us,”  Michael Foeth , an analyst
at Vontobel Holding AG, wrote in a note to clients. “CEO
transition remains an issue.”  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s largest
lenders, retreated 2.3 percent to 14.37 francs and 3.1 percent
to 24.03 francs, respectively. A gauge of banking shares was the
second-worst performer of the 19 industry groups in the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   Transocean climbed 1.3 percent to 49.23 francs. Net income
totaled $456 million, or $1.19 a share, compared with a loss of
$6.17 billion, or $18.67, a year earlier. Excluding a $101
million tax benefit, per-share profit was 9 cents more than the
average of 35 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company recommended a dividend of $2.24 a share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
