U.K.  house prices  rose for the first
time in nine months in February as demand for homes increased in
London and southern England, Hometrack Ltd. said.  Prices in England and Wales advanced 0.1 percent from the
previous month, the property researcher said in a statement
today. The number of new buyers registering with agents rose
14.3 percent on the month, outpacing an 8.7 percent increase in
supply. From a year earlier, values were down 0.1 percent.  “The impetus for improved market conditions and higher
prices has been driven by London and the home counties of
southern England, where there is the greatest mismatch between
supply and demand,” said  Richard Donnell , director of research
at Hometrack. “We expect demand for housing to continue to grow
as we move into spring.”  While  higher inflation  has squeezed households, the  Bank of
England ’s Funding-for-Lending Scheme has boosted credit
availability, with policy maker  Paul Fisher  noting that mortgage
activity is beginning to revive.  Nationwide Building Society 
said last week that house prices rose in February and there were
reasons for “cautious optimism.”  In London, values rose 0.3 percent in February from
January, Hometrack said. New buyer registrations in the capital
increased 18.5 percent.  Still, the strength of the economic recovery remains
uncertain, with a Markit Economics index on March 1 showing that
 manufacturing  unexpectedly shrank in February as new orders
plunged. The same day, the Bank of England said mortgage
approvals unexpectedly declined in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
