European stocks were little changed
as utility shares rallied, offsetting  HSBC (HSBA)  Holdings Plc’s
biggest retreat since July and a survey that showed China’s
services industries slowed last month.  HSBC contributed the most to a decline by a gauge of
European lenders after reporting pretax earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates.  BHP Billiton  Ltd. and  Rio Tinto  Group each
lost more than 2 percent as commodity producers slipped.
Debenhams Plc slid the most since November 2008 after saying
that profit will drop in the first half of the year because it
snowed in January.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index slipped less than 0.1 percent to
288.89 at the close of trading as more than four stocks fell for
every three that rose. The equity benchmark was little changed
last week as  Italy ’s inconclusive elections reignited concern
that the euro area’s debt crisis will worsen, offsetting U.S.
economic data that beat forecasts.  “It seems that equities have run a bit too fast relative
to the reality of a still subdued, and in some places,
vulnerable recovery,” said Witold Bahrke, who helps oversee $55
billion of assets as senior strategist at PFA Pension A/S in
Copenhagen. “Together with increasing political noise, from
Europe primarily, this doesn’t bode well.”  In China, the  non-manufacturing  purchasing managers’ index
for the world’s second-largest economy fell to 54.5 in February
from 56.2 in January, the National Bureau of Statistics and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said.  Mortgage Restrictions  China ’s government intensified its three-year campaign to
cool the real estate market, ordering larger deposits and
stricter enforcement of sales taxes. The People’s Bank of
China’s regional branches may implement the measures in
conjunction with the price-control targets of local governments,
the country’s cabinet said in  a statement .  In  Rome , a senior aide to Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani said the country will need to hold another
election if the center left fails to build a coalition
commanding a majority of seats in the Senate.  The finance ministers of the 17-member euro area meet in
Brussels today to discuss the planned bailout for Cyprus.  National benchmark indexes dropped in 12 of the 18 western-
 European (SXXP)  markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.5 percent,
 France ’s CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent and  Germany ’s DAX retreated 0.2
percent.  Greece ’s ASE Index lost 2.1 percent after Russell
Investments reclassified the country as an emerging market.  HSBC Retreats  HSBC dropped 2.5 percent to 710 pence after saying pretax
earnings fell 5.6 percent in 2012 because of a record settlement
for anti-money-laundering sanctions in the U.S. and a charge to
revalue its own debt. Profit of $20.65 billion trailed the
$23.49 billion estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
The lender took a $5.2 billion charge for revaluing its debt.  A gauge of European commodity producers lost 2.1 percent
for the biggest drop among the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx
600. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, the world’s largest mining
companies, slid 2.1 percent to 2,037 pence and 3.7 percent to
3,316 pence, respectively. Kazakhmys Plc,  Kazakhstan ’s biggest
copper producer, tumbled 5.9 percent to 555 pence.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  retreated 2.7 percent to 1,849 pence
after Nomura Holdings Inc. downgraded the stock to reduce, a
rating similar to sell, from neutral. The brokerage said that
analysts need to lower their estimates for the company’s
earnings this year.  Debenhams, Metro  Debenhams slumped 15 percent to 80.7 pence, for the biggest
tumble on the Stoxx 600. The second-largest U.K. department
store forecast that pretax profit for the first half of the year
will decline to 120 million pounds ($181 million) after snow
disrupted sales. Comparable revenue dropped 10 percent from Jan.
14 to Jan. 27, the retailer said.  Metro AG retreated 6.2 percent to 21.14 euros as Citigroup
Inc. cut its price forecast for Germany’s largest retailer to 15
euros from 19 euros and repeated a sell recommendation. The
shares slid on March 1 after Metro cut its full-year dividend 26
percent and posted earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  dropped 2.6 percent to 81.45 pence after
the U.K. housebuilder was downgraded to sell from neutral at
Citigroup. The brokerage said the shares have rallied too far
compared with other companies in its industry.  France Telecom SA (FTE)  surged 5.7 percent to 7.72 euros, its
biggest rally in seven months. France’s largest phone company
was raised to overweight, meaning that investors should buy the
shares, from underweight at Morgan Stanley, which said the stock
could rally 50 percent.  An  index  of European utilities rose to its highest level in
a month. Veolia Environnement SA jumped 6 percent to 10.22 euros
for the biggest gain on the gauge.  Repsol SA advanced 2.5 percent to 16.70 euros. The Spanish
oil producer sold a 5.04 percent stake to Temasek Holdings Pte
for 1.04 billion euros ($1.35 billion).  Singapore ’s state-owned
