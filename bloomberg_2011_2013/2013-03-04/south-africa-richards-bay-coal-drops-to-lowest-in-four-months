Coal export prices at  South Africa ’s
 Richards Bay , the continent’s biggest terminal for shipping the
fuel, decreased to the lowest level in four months.  Coal for  immediate delivery  fell $1.26, or 1.5 percent, to
$84.76 a metric ton in the week to March 1, the lowest level
since Nov. 9, according to IHS McCloskey data on Bloomberg.  Prices may move sideways or down, after declining amid a
weaker euro and softer oil and power prices last week, Bevan Jones, a general manager at London Commodity Brokers Ltd., said
in a note.  “News from  China  on government attempts to cool the
property sector have seen falls in demand for both coal and iron
ore,” Jones said.  The fuel is quoted on a free-on-board basis, which excludes
delivery costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
