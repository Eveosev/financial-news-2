Rates to hire Panamax ships, the
largest to transit the Panama Canal, climbed to the highest in
more than seven months amid increasing South American grain
cargoes.  Hire costs rose 2.2 percent to $8,463 a day, the highest
since July 25, according to the  Baltic Exchange  in London. Rates
have gained for 19 consecutive sessions, the longest rally since
July 2007, the data show. The Baltic Dry Index, a wider measure
of freight prices, gained 1.7 percent to 789.  The global fleet of 2,320 Panamaxes carried more than 40
percent of grains shipped by sea in 2012, according to figures
from Clarkson Plc and ICAP Shipping International Ltd., two
London-based shipbrokers. Panamax rates rose in March in four of
the past five years, exchange data show.  The “South American grain season is dominating the
market,” RS Platou Markets A/S, an Oslo-based investment bank,
said in an e-mailed report today.  Higher rates in the Atlantic Ocean are enticing ships from
the Pacific, reducing the number available in the Asian market
at a time when demand for Indonesian coal shipments to  China  is
“firm,”  Clarkson (CKN)  said in a March 1 report.  Panamax capacity expanded by 13 percent in 2012, the
second-fastest rate of expansion since 1982, Clarkson figures
show. The wider shipping industry has 20 percent too much
capacity after the global fleet grew by 35 percent since 2008,
compared with world trade that expanded by 14 percent, the
London shipbroker said.  Average rates for Capesize vessels, the biggest dry-bulk
ships that transport ore and coal, declined 0.6 percent to
$4,210 daily, according to the exchange. Smaller Supramaxes that
carry minerals and grains climbed 2.5 percent to $8,374.
Handysizes, the smallest tracked, advanced 1.7 percent to $6,783
daily, exchange figures show.  Rates for Panamaxes averaged $6,428 last month. They need
$6,606 to cover operating costs, minus fuel, figures from Moore
Stephens LLP, a  London  shipping accountant show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
