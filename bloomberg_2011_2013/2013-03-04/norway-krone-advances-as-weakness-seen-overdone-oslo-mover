Norway’s krone strengthened the most
in more than a month in Oslo trading amid speculation the
currency’s plunge to a seven-month low is overdone.  The krone strengthened as much as 0.72 percent against the
euro, the most since Sept. 7, and was up 0.58 percent at 7.4486
as of 1:05 p.m. in Oslo. It strengthened against all major
currencies in a basket compiled by Bloomberg. The krone traded
at 7.5246 per euro on March 1, the weakest level since July 17.  “The krone has been under rather heavy pressure in recent
weeks and underperformed probably too much,” Nils Kristian Knudsen, an analyst at Svenska Handelsbanken AB, said in an e-
mailed response to questions. The move may also be a reaction to
short-term profit taking in various cross-rates, such as the one
compared to the Swedish krona, he said.  The Norwegian krone has weakened 1.4 percent so far this
year after the central bank last month signaled that it’s
prepared to cut interest rates to counter krone gains. The krona
in neighboring  Sweden , by contrast, has surged 2.5 percent
against the euro after central bank policy makers and government
officials including Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt have taken
a hands-off approach to their currency’s strength.  “With euro-dollar and euro-krona heading south for the
last month, it was a question of time before the euro-krone
followed,” Magne Oestnor, a currency analyst at DNB ASA, said
by phone from Oslo.  The Swedish krona has jumped 3.8 percent against its
Norwegian counterpart this year. It lost 0.45 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
