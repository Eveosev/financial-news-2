Powerwave Technologies Inc. (PWAVQ) , a
bankrupt maker of antennas and amplifiers for wireless
communications, won court permission to set up an auction for
most of the company’s assets.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath approved rules for the
auction today at a hearing in Wilmington, Delaware.  The company, based in  Santa Ana , California, asked
potential buyers who want to be the so-called stalking-horse, or
initial bidder, to submit offers later this month, according to
court records.  “Given the lack of immediately available liquidity, the
debtor has determined to market its assets, as well as the on-
going business,” Powerwave said in court papers filed Feb. 22.  The company listed debt of $396 million and assets of
$213 million in a Chapter 11 petition filed in January.  In February 2012, Powerwave  announced  a restructuring plan
designed to cut manufacturing costs and conserve cash, in part
by firing about 60 workers. That was followed in September by
the announcement that 120 people would be fired and some offices
shut down.  The company makes equipment to boost signal strength for
wireless phone and data networks.  The case is Powerwave Technologies Inc., 13-10134,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
