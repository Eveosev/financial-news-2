Midwest  diesel fuel  strengthened to
the  highest level  in more than four months versus futures after
 BP Plc (BP/)  was said to have started maintenance on a unit at the
largest refinery in the area.  BP’s 420,000-barrel-a-day  Whiting, Indiana, refinery  is
conducting planned work on a desulfurization unit for an unknown
duration, according to a person familiar with operations who
asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
A 225,000-barrel-a-day crude unit, the largest at the site, is
also undergoing maintenance.  “The desulfurization process is one of the final steps
before you put diesel to the market so if you lose that
capacity, you can be out of diesel pretty quickly,” Steve
Mosby, vice president of supply consultant ADMO Energy LLC, said
in a phone interview from  Kansas City ,  Missouri . “Midwest
supplies are already tight.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Midwest, or  Group 3 region ,
gained 1.75 cents to 11.13 cents above heating oil futures on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:05 p.m., the biggest
spread since Oct. 22. The  same fuel  was up 0.5 cent at a 13-cent
premium in  Chicago .  The work at BP Whiting may further drain Midwest distillate
supplies, which the Energy Information Administration data show
are hovering at the  lowest level  for this time of year since
2006. Stockpiles of distillates including diesel fuel and
heating oil totaled 30.7 million barrels in the week ended Feb.
22, according to EIA.  “Diesel is going to have some legs,” Mosby said. “The
cracks are so good there won’t be any diesel in inventory.
Refineries are selling everything they got.”  The  3-2-1 crack spread , or measure of refining
profitability for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma ,  fell  26 cents to $33.37 a
barrel, up from $27.07 a barrel a month earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
