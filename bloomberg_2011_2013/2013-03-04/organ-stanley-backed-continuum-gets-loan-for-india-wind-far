Continuum Wind Energy, backed by
Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners LP, received a 9-billion
rupee ($164 million) loan from banks for a wind farm in  India .  The lenders led by the  State Bank of India (SBIN)  issued letters
of credit to the local unit of  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) ,
Continuumâ€™s Chief Executive Officer Arvind Bansal said in an
interview. The wind farm operator has placed orders for 40 wind
turbines with Vestas.  Continuum, based in Singapore, plans to start generating
power from its 175-megawatt wind project in the western Indian
state of Maharashtra by the end of this year, Bansal said. The
company has 44 megawatts of installed wind capacity in India at
present.  Electricity generated from the new plant will be sold to
the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co., Bansal said.
Continuum is majority owned by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure
Partners, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
