Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
for a second day, to the lowest level in more than six weeks as
inventories in  China  climbed for a ninth week, adding to concern
that the market is oversupplied.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped as much as 2.6 percent to 3,916  yuan  ($629) a
metric ton, the lowest level since Jan. 17 for a most-active
contract, and was at 3,929 at 9:41 a.m. local time. Futures fell
1.8 percent last month, the first drop since November.  Inventory jumped 79 percent this year through March 1,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information. China is holding
the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress this week
to mark the once-in-a-decade leadership transition in Beijing.
Outgoing Premier  Wen Jiabao  will outline economic policies as
the government grapples with sustaining a recovery from the
slowest growth in 13 years without triggering a resurgence in
consumer and asset-price inflation.  “If the policies remain stable with no big stimulus post
the National People’s Congress, as our base case is, we expect
finished steel prices to fall due to the excessive inventory at
traders,” Frankie Zhu, analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said
in a report e-mailed today.  The average spot  price  for rebar was unchanged at 3,790
yuan a ton on March 1, after declining for five straight
sessions, according to data from Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery fell 0.7 percent
to $150.60 a ton on March 1, according to data compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
