Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures
Commission has imposed a lifetime ban on Du Jun, a former Morgan
Stanley managing director convicted of insider trading.  Du is forbidden to re-join the financial industry, the
city’s securities watchdog said in a  press release  today. Du
worked for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong from 2001 until May 2007,
when he was fired.  The disciplinary action follows the completion of criminal
proceedings against Du for insider dealing in the shares of
 Citic Resources Holdings Ltd. (1205)   Du was a part of a team of Morgan
Stanley bankers advising Citic Resources on acquiring oilfield
assets in  China , the commission said in September.  The SFC wants to send a strong message to deter others from
committing similar offenses, the regulator said in today’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
