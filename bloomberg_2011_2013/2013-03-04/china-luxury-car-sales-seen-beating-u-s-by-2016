China premium car sales will
probably surpass the U.S. as early as 2016 and equal that of
Western Europe by 2020, driven by rising incomes in the world’s
second-largest economy, according to McKinsey & Co.  Demand for luxury vehicles in China is expected to more
than double by 2020 to 3 million from the 1.25 million cars sold
last year, outpacing the total market, McKinsey said in a report
released today. Deliveries of upscale autos will probably reach
2.25 million by 2016, according to McKinsey’s estimates.  Automakers from  General Motors Co. (GM)  to  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  are
expanding their premium brands to compete for luxury buyers in
China, where German marques led by Volkswagen AG’s Audi account
for about 80 percent of sales, according to McKinsey. Ford Motor
Co. plans to start sales of its Lincoln nameplate in China next
year, while PSA Peugeot Citroen is readying its flagship DS
dealership in Shanghai.  “Even now, China’s premium car market presents a sizable
opportunity for latecomers,” Sha Sha, Theodore Huang and Erwin
Gabardi at McKinsey wrote in the report. “Japanese and U.S.
attackers still have a chance to create a market footprint.”  Luxury car sales have increased 36 percent annually in the
past decade, compared with the 26 percent rate for the total
passenger-vehicle market, according to McKinsey. The segment
remains attractive for automakers as 111 large Chinese cities
still don’t have premium car dealerships, according to Morgan
Stanley & Co.  Premium Sales  Audi sales in  China  and Hong Kong rose 30 percent last year
to a record 405,838 units. German luxury nameplates accounted
for 80 percent of premium car sales in China last year, with the
remaining shared by other European, U.S. and Japanese brands,
McKinsey said.  In its survey of Chinese consumers, 59 percent of
respondents said they won’t choose a local brand when buying
premium vehicles, while 16 percent believe a Chinese automaker
will never be able to produce a luxury model that garners global
recognition.  Women are also becoming more important as buyers of premium
cars and they value exterior styling, safety and comfort,
according to McKinsey, which surveyed 1,200 consumers in 12
large Chinese cities for its report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
