Liverpool said its 10-month pretax
loss narrowed as administrative costs declined.  The pretax loss for the 10 months ended May 31, 2012 was
40.5 million pounds ($61 million), compared with 49.3 million
pounds for the 12 months ended July 2011, the company said today
in a statement. It shortened the fiscal year to align it with
the soccer season.  Liverpoolâ€™s revenue fell to 169 million pounds from 183.6
million pounds in the year earlier period as it failed to make
either the Champions League or Europa League continental
competitions. Some of the decline was made up by more money from
domestic cup competitions after Liverpool won the League Cup in
the period.  Net debt rose to 87.2 million pounds from 65.4 million.
After the reporting period, the owners made a 46.8 million no-
interest loan to the English club to repay debt on a stadium
loan.  Total administrative costs declined to 186.8 million pounds
from 252.1 million pounds in the year earlier period, the club
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
