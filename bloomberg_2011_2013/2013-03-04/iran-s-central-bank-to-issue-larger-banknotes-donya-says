Iran ’s Central Bank plans to issue
banknotes with twice the value of the largest ones in
circulation,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing Majid Saniei, an
official at the financial institution.  The bank will start printing 200,000-rial ($16) banknotes
as soon as it receives permission from the  Economy Ministry  and
will release the new notes into circulation in the Iranian new
year starting March 21, the Tehran-based daily quoted Saniei,
head of Iran’s security and minting organization, as saying.  The Central Bank is also seeking approval for 500,000-rial
notes and plans to introduce these in two years’ time, Saniei
said. Iran’s largest banknote at the moment is 100,000 rials.  The rial has weakened in the past year as the Persian Gulf
country battles U.S. and European Union economic sanctions which
have contributed to an inflation rate nearing 30 percent. Iran’s
 Central Bank  estimates inflation will rise to between 30.6% and
31.5% in the Iranian month of Esfand ending March 20, Central
Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani said last month. Iran is at
loggerheads with Western powers over its nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
