India ’s fiscal deficit in the year
through March 2013 may be narrower than estimated in the budget,
the nation’s finance minister said.  “We have contained the fiscal deficit at 5.2 percent this
year and when the actual numbers come, it may be slightly
better,” Palaniappan Chidambaram said at a conference in New
Delhi today. He targeted a  gap  of 4.8 percent of gross domestic
product for 2013-2014 in the Feb. 28 budget, striving to
preserve India’s investment-grade credit rating.  Chidambaram also increased spending on the poor to court
support before elections, relying on higher tax receipts, asset
sales and subsidy cuts to trim the widest deficit in major
emerging nations. The budget has led to a mixed response:
Moody’s Investors Service described it today as realistic and
“credit positive,” while Credit Suisse Group AG said last week
the plan’s revenue assumptions are “too high.”  The government will announce more measures to boost
economic expansion, Chidambaram said at the conference with
industrialists today, adding he plans to visit  Japan ,  Canada  and
the U.S. in April and May to woo investors.  India is under pressure to lure capital inflows to fund a
record current-account shortfall. Chidambaram reiterated that
the imbalance in trade is more worrying than the fiscal gap.  The yield on the 8.15 percent note due June 2022 has
climbed to 7.89 percent from 7.80 percent since Chidambaram
presented the budget and unveiled record gross market borrowing
of 6.29 trillion rupees ($115 billion).  Asia ’s No. 3 economy  expanded  4.5 percent in the three
months to Dec. 31 from a year earlier, the weakest pace in
almost four years, a report showed last week. Cooling
investment, a drop in exports and government spending restraint
this fiscal year sapped expansion.  The nation’s GDP will probably climb 6 percent in the year
starting April 1 and 7 percent in 2014-2015, Chidambaram said
separately in an online discussion hosted by Google India.  To contact the reporters on this story:
