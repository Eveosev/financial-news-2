PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) , Poland’s largest
lender, declined the most in four months as the country’s
slowing economy cut profit and curbed lending.  The  stock  slumped 2.4 percent in Warsaw, the steepest drop
since Nov. 7. The amount of shares traded was 105 percent of the
three-month daily average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  PKO’s net income fell 1.5 percent to 3.75 billion zloty
($1.2 billion) in 2012 after its net interest margin shrank to
4.5 percent in the fourth quarter from 4.7 percent in the
previous three months, the state-controlled bank said in a
 presentation  on its website today. Net loans rose 0.8 percent in
the fourth quarter over the previous three months, compared with
a full-year increase of 1.6 percent, it said.  Fourth-quarter revenue was “disappointing” while “margin
pressure will be a key concern over the coming quarter,” Michal Konarski and Mark MacRae, Warsaw-based analysts at Wood & Co.,
said in a note today.  PKO sees Polish banks’ combined profit falling 10 percent
to 15 percent this year, Pawel Borys, head of strategy at PKO,
told reporters in Warsaw today. The bank’s business performance
won’t be “significantly different” from the market, he said.  Poland’s economy will probably grow 1.2 percent this year,
the weakest pace in 12 years, as domestic demand and exports are
hampered by weak economic performance of the country’s main
trading partners, the European Commission said on Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
