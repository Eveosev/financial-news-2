South African corn futures rose to
the highest level in more than two months on concern that the
dry weather in some of the country’s main growing regions is
threatening yields.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
gained 3.7 percent to 2,264 rand ($249) a metric ton, the
highest since Dec. 6, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in the
same month also surged 3.7 percent to 2,230 rand a ton.  Bothaville in the Free State province hasn’t had sufficient
rains for the past two weeks.  “There was almost no rain in the Free State and most
western parts of the country over the weekend, Brink van Wyk, a
trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria . ‘‘The
market is now giving a clear indication that they are worried
about maize. The yield is starting to suffer because of the lack
of rain.’’  The country’s Crop Estimates Committee predicts that South
African farmers will produce 12.4 million tons of corn, also
known as maize, this season, more than what was produced in
2011-12.  The relative strength index for white corn rose to 70.7
today. A reading above 70 is a signal to technical analysts that
the price is poised to drop.  South Africa is the continent’s biggest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as animal feed.  Wheat for May delivery declined less than 0.1 percent to
3,480 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
