Gold output in  Australia , the
second-biggest producer, rose in the fourth quarter to trim an
annual drop, mining consultant Surbiton Associates Pty said.  Production was 67 metric tons in the three months to
December, up 1 percent from a year earlier and almost 8 percent
from the third quarter, Melbourne-based Surbiton said in a
statement yesterday. That left the full-year total at 256 tons,
down 4 percent from 2011, it said.  “Several producers had to deal with short-term technical
issues during the year, which reduced overall output,” Sandra Close, a director at Surbiton, said in the statement. “At last,
we are seeing the effects of some new mines coming on-stream. As
well, there were better performances from several established
operations.”  Australia ranked second, behind  China , as the biggest
bullion miner in 2011, according to London-based researcher
 Thomson Reuters  GFMS. The metal averaged a record $1,718 an
ounce in the fourth quarter and gained the past 12 years, the
best run in at least nine decades. It traded at $1,578.20 by
10:33 a.m.  London , down 5.8 percent this year and 18 percent
below the record $1,921.15 set in September 2011.  Output in the first-quarter is often lower due to fewer
“all-up” days and because the cyclone season with high
rainfall can affect operations, Close said.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
