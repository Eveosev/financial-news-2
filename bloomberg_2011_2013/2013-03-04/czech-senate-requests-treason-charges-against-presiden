The Czech Senate approved a motion
to file treason charges against President Vaclav Klaus over an
amnesty he granted to thousands of convicted criminals and
suspects at the start of the year.  The upper house of parliament, controlled by the opposition
Social Democrats, approved the request in a ballot today, Senate
head Milan Stech told reporters in Prague. The charge will be
filed at the  Constitutional Court , Stech said.  The Social Democrats, the most popular party in opinion
polls and the largest in both houses of the legislature, has
criticized the amnesty and demanded the dismissal of Premier
Petr Necas, who signed the amnesty. Klaus has said the move was
legal.  “The Senate couldn’t remain silent in a situation when the
president repeatedly violated the constitution,” Jiri
Dienstbier, a Social Democratic senator, said in a televised
briefing. “The independent Constitutional Court will have a
chance to assess how deep the violation of the constitution by
the president was.”  Klaus, the Czech Republic’s highest-profile critic of the
European Union and its common currency, will leave office on
March 7 when his second and final term expires. Among his most
notable acts during 10 years as president was to delay signing
the EU’s Lisbon Treaty in 2009.  According to the constitution, presidents found guilty of
treason must step down and cannot hold the office again.  The Senate move damages the  Czech Republic ’s reputation
abroad and was motivated “purely by personal animosity,” the
CTK newswire quoted Necas as saying today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
