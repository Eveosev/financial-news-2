Yields on Polish government bonds
declined and the zloty was little changed amid speculation the
central bank will cut  interest rates  for a fifth time since
November this week.  Policy makers will reduce the  Poland ’s reference rate by a
quarter point to 3.5 percent on March 6, according to 22 of 38
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The remainder expect the central
bank to keep borrowing costs on hold after cutting them by a
total of 100 basis points over the last four months, as the
economy slowed along with inflation pressure.  “The next factor that can move the market is Wednesday’s
interest-rate decision and the statement that follows the
meeting,” Pawel Bialczynski, bond trader at BRE Bank SA, said
by phone from Warsaw. “Bond prices were little changed today.”  The yield on five-year  government bonds  declined two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.64 percent at 5:21 p.m.
The zloty weakened less than 0.1 percent to 4.1388 against the
euro, extending this year’s decline to 1.4 percent, the seventh-
biggest slump among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
