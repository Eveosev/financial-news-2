Baltimore Ravens quarterback  Joe Flacco  completed his  Super Bowl  season by agreeing to the
richest contract in National Football League history.  The Baltimore Sun reported that the deal is worth $120.6
million and includes a $29 million signing bonus and $52 million
in guaranteed money. The per-year average exceeds New Orleans
Saints quarterback Drew Brees’s $20 million a year, ESPN
reported.  The deal allows Flacco to avoid being labeled the Ravens’
franchise player, which would have forced him to sign a one-year
contract worth $14.9 million and place all the risk of injury on
the 28-year-old passer.  “It was never about the money, it was about earning the
respect,” Flacco said during a news conference announcing the
deal. “It means a lot.”  Soon after news broke that Flacco had consummated a deal,
his teammates began posting comments on the social networking
site, Twitter.  “Dinner and a few nights on Joe Flacco when we get back
well deserved,” running back  Ray Rice  posted.  “Man now that’s a pay day!!” offensive lineman Michael
Oher commented on the site. “Nobody’s more proud of Joe than
his teammates because we all  knew he was worth it!!! $$$$$$$
lol.”  Though Flacco’s contract is a six-year agreement, the deal
probably will be re-written in the fourth year or Flacco will be
released. That’s because he will account for $29 million against
the team’s salary limit then, far too much of the total cap,
according to  NFL.com .  Flacco’s salary will eat up just $6.8 million of
Baltimore’s $123 million cap in the coming season, which gives
the Super Bowl champions room to sign other players.  Asked what he is going to do with the money, Flacco said:
“Nothing immediately. I’m gonna look at it and smile a little
bit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
