KNG Securities LLP said it hired
Cedric van Kerrebroeck to develop the London-based brokerage’s
 fixed-income  coverage of  Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg
and to strengthen its structured notes business.  Van Kerrebroeck joins from Deutsche Bank AG, where he
worked for seven years in various roles, most recently as a euro
bond trader and previously developing structured products across
asset classes, KNG said in a statement today.  The hire is KNG’s ninth in the past three months, and
follows last month’s addition of Armando La Morgia to build its
structured finance business, according to the statement.  “We are witnessing a significant shift in the structure of
the market as clients increasingly favor working with smaller,
specialist firms,” Andrea Podesta, the firm’s head of fixed
income, said in the statement. “Cedric’s experience will be
crucial both in developing KNG’s geographical footprint in the
Benelux region and for our structured notes business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
