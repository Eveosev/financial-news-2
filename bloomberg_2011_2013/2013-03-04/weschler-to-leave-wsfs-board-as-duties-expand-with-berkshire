Ted Weschler is stepping down from
the board of  WSFS Financial Corp. (WSFS)  as he takes on a larger role
helping  Warren Buffett  manage funds at  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   Weschler, 51, isn’t running for re-election at the bank’s
2013 annual meeting, according to a regulatory filing today from
Wilmington, Delaware-based WSFS.  Buffett has been expanding the amount of funds overseen by
Weschler and Todd Combs, 42, former hedge fund managers who
joined Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire in the past three years.
Each will oversee about $6 billion by the end of this month,
more twice as much as in May, Buffett, 82, told CNBC today.  The investment managers “have proved to be smart, models
of integrity, helpful to Berkshire in many ways beyond portfolio
management,” Buffett said in a March 1  letter  to shareholders.  Weschler was a director of the bank from 1992 to 2007 and
rejoined in 2009, according to a regulatory filing from the
company. His hedge fund invested in the bank before he joined
Buffett at Berkshire.  Court records show Weschler was involved in Berkshire’s bid
for a loan portfolio from bankrupt lender Residential Capital
LLC last year. He also helped Buffett on a deal to buy most of
Media General Inc.’s newspapers for about $140 million in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
