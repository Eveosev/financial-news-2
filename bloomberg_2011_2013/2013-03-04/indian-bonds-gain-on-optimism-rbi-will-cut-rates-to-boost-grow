Indian  bonds  gained, snapping a two-
day loss, on speculation the central bank will reduce  interest
rates  this month to spur economic growth.  Asia ’s third-largest  economy  expanded 4.5 percent in the
three months ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier, the weakest  pace 
in almost four years, according to a government statement last
week. The  Reserve Bank  of India cut the repurchase  rate  by 25
basis points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29, lowering it for the
first time in nine months. Finance Minister Palaniappan
Chidambaram vowed last week to cut the budget  deficit  by 0.4
percentage point to 4.8 percent for the year starting April 1.  “Bonds are likely to be supported by expectations of
another rate cut,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, Mumbai-based
executive vice president of treasury at  Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK) 
“Fiscal consolidation efforts and slowing growth may trigger
monetary easing.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.89 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  The economy will expand by 6.5 percent in the coming fiscal
year if the RBI lowers rates,  Press Trust of India  reported
yesterday, citing Chidambaram. The next monetary policy review
is scheduled for March 19.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell five basis
points to 7.58 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
