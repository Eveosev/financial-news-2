Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  investor  Carl Icahn , in
a vote of confidence in Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings,
said he won’t seek seats on the board of the online video
service and won’t sell his 10 percent stake.  “We think he’s done a great job,” Icahn, 77, said in a
telephone interview. “When you make $600-$700 million, you
don’t punch the CEO in the face.”  Icahn informed the Los Gatos, California-based company
three weeks ago that he wouldn’t seek seats on the seven-person
board during the current nominating period, he said in the
interview. Hastings is positioning the company well for growth,
Icahn said.  The comments caused Netflix shares, which had faltered on
speculation Icahn was selling, to partly recover. They closed
down 4.3 percent to $181.21 in New York, after falling as much
as 6.7 percent earlier.  Netflix declined to comment, said Joris Evers, a spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
