The Iraqi army broke up a protest
today by people seeking work at the OAO Lukoil-operated West
Qurna-2 oil field, according to a Moscow-based company official.  Several dozen people blocked the entrance to a central
processing facility run by Samsung Group, according to the
official, asking not to be identified due to company policy.  The police and army were called in to restore order and no
significant damage was done, the person said.  Lukoil signed a $988 million contract with Samsung to help
develop West Qurna-2 in March 2012. The Moscow-based company
holds 75 percent of the field after Statoil SA withdrew from the
project last year. The Iraqi government controls the remaining
shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
