Taiwan dollar fell the most in three
weeks after reports stoked concern China’s economic rebound is
losing momentum, damping the outlook for exports to the island’s
biggest market.  Government bonds  gained.  China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index dropped to a five-month
low of 50.1 in February, while a separate gauge compiled by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics fell to a four-month low of
50.4, reports showed March 1. Economists forecast data on March
7 will show Taiwan’s overseas shipments shrank 8.1 percent last
month from a year earlier, after rising 21.8 percent in January,
based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The disappointing PMIs were in part due to the seasonal
Lunar holidays but for overall trade demand we expect the
improvement to be quite modest,” said Jackit Wong, a regional
economist in  Hong Kong  at Natixis Asia Ltd. “Uncertainties
remain, with Italian elections and U.S. spending cuts” in the
backdrop, she said.  The local dollar fell 0.4 percent to NT$29.77 per dollar,
according to Taipei Forex Inc., the most since Feb. 8. One-month
non-deliverable forwards declined 0.3 percent to NT$29.730,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility in the  Taiwan dollar , a gauge
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
increased six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.81
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Exports may be crimped by the Feb. 9-15 Lunar New Year
holidays, Wong said. Market sentiment may be downbeat in the
short term ahead of March data, she added.  The yield on the 1.125 percent government bonds due
September 2022 dropped one basis point to 1.201 percent, the
lowest in a month for 10-year benchmark, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending  rate was
steady at 0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
