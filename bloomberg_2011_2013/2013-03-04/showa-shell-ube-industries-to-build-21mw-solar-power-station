Showa Shell (5002)  Sekiyu K.K. and Ube
Industries Ltd. will build and operate a 21 megawatt solar power
station in western Japan.  The companies set up a venture to start construction of the
plant in Yamaguchi prefecture in April, Showa Shell, the
Japanese refining unit of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) , said in a
statement today. The station will start operation in July next
year.  Solar Frontier K.K., a wholly owned unit of Showa Shell and
a maker of thin-film solar panels, will supply panels for the
plant, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
