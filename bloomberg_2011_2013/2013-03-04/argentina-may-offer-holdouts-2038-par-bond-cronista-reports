Argentina  may offer bonds due 2038
at par value to creditors who are claiming payment on their
defaulted debt in U.S. courts, Cronista  reported  today without
saying how it obtained the information.  The offer would be in response to a U.S. appeals court
request that Argentina propose a payment alternative to U.S.
District Court Judge Thomas Griesa’s order that the government
pay the full $1.3 billion the creditors are seeking when it pays
performing debt, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper reported.  The country’s Economy Minister Hernan Lorenzino, Finance
Secretary Adrian Cosentino and Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &
Hamilton LLP, legal counsel to Argentina in the case, today will
discuss by telephone different payment options, Cronista said.  In its 2005 and 2010 debt swaps, Argentina offered Par
bonds due 2038, Discount bonds due 2033, Global bonds due 2017
and securities linked to economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
