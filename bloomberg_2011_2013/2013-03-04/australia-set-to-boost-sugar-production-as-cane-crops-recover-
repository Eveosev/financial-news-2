Australia , the worldâ€™s third-biggest
sugar exporter, may increase output 5.6 percent next fiscal year
as farmers boost plantings and crops recover from consecutive
years of wet weather, according to a government forecaster.  Raw sugar output may total 4.5 million metric tons in the
year starting July 1 from 4.3 million tons a year earlier, the
Canberra-based  Australian Bureau  of Agricultural and Resource
Economics and Sciences said in a report today. Exports are set
to increase to 3.2 million tons from 3 million tons, it said.  Sugar has slumped 27 percent in the past year as prices
that climbed to a three-decade high in February 2011 spurred
output. Global supply will exceed demand for a fourth year,
pushing futures to the lowest level since 2010, Germany-based
researcher F.O. Licht GmbH said Feb. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
