HellermannTyton Group Plc is seeking
to raise about 250 million euros ($325 million) in an initial
public offering it announced today, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.  The sale may value HellermannTyton, which specializes in
making cable ties and fasteners for a range of industrial
purposes, at about 600 million euros, said the person, asking
not to be named during the IPO marketing process.  HellermannTyton said that it would raise 35 million euros
of new capital and sell an unspecified amount of shares already
owned by its management and U.K. private-equity firm  Doughty
Hanson  & Co. The company’s free float will be about 40 percent,
the HellermannTyton  statement  said.  With the company seeking about 250 million euros, it would 
raise about 215 million euros through secondary shares. Doughty 
Hanson  bought  HellermannTyton in 2006.  A spokesman for HellermannTyton declined to comment on the
amount of funds sought.  The proceeds will be used to reduce leverage, for general
working capital purposes and to provide capital for potential
“bolt-on acquisitions,” the statement said.  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) , JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Numis Securities Ltd. are
managing the sale, which will be completed by the end of March.  HellermannTyton management owns about 6 percent of the
company while Doughty Hanson owns about 94 percent, according to
a term sheet obtained by  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporters on this story:
