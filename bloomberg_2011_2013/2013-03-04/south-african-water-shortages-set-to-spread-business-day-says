Water shortages in  South Africa  may
spread to Bloemfontein, the capital of the Free State province,
Johannesburg-based Business Day reported.  Water deficits, caused by a lack of infrastructure, have
been experienced in Nelspruit in Mpumalanga, Mafikeng and Brits
in the North West province and in Brandfort in Free State,
Business Day cited Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority consultant
Richard Holden as saying.  A lack of qualified engineers with knowledge of how to run
water-treatment plants is also contributing to the shortage,
Business Day said, citing Holden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
