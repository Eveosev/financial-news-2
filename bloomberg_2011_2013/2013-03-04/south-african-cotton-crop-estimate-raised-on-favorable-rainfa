South Africa ’s cotton crop will
probably be 7 percent greater than previously estimated this
production year as higher rainfall will increase yields.  Farmers in South Africa and Swaziland will probably harvest
34,000 lint bales in the year through July, Pretoria-based
 Cotton SA  said today in a statement, up from last month’s
estimate of about 32,000 bales.  “We’ve had good rainfall in the cotton planting areas,”
Chief Executive Officer Hennie Bruwer said by phone. “It will
lead to a better cotton yield per hectare.”  Farmers had switched to planting corn from cotton last
quarter as price of yellow corn, used as  animal feed , rose to a
record 2,809 rand ($309) a metric ton on July 30. Cotton gained
0.8 percent to 84.36 cents a pound by 10:30 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
