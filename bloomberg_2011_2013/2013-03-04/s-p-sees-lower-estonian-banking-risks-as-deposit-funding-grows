Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
raised its risk ranking for Estonian banks, citing a lower
reliance of the Baltic nation’s lenders on funding from their
Nordic parents and a stable market environment.  Estonia’s ranking improved to group 5 from group 6 on a
1-10 scale where a lower score is better, S&P said in a Banking
Industry Country Risk Assessment report, e-mailed to clients on
Feb. 28. Group 5 includes countries such as China, Poland and
 Turkey , it said.  Estonian banks, including units of Stockholm-based  Swedbank
AB (SWEDA)  and  SEB AB (SEBA) , have cut reliance on funding from Nordic parents
after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 collapse burst a
property bubble, shut off credit flows and triggered the world’s
worst recessions in the Baltics.  “System-wide funding has improved significantly over the
past two years,” S&P analysts Regina Argenio, based in Milan,
and Sean Cotten, based in  Stockholm , said in the report. “We
view Estonian banks’ risk appetite as moderate, given their
focus on domestic traditional commercial banking activities.
Moreover, high concentrated system, dominated by subsidiaries of
Nordic banks, provides adequate stability.”  Core customer deposits increased to about 57 percent of
total loans at the end of last year from a low of 41 percent
three years earlier, S&P said. Net banking-sector external debt
had dropped to “about” 15 percent of loans because of a higher
domestic savings rate, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
