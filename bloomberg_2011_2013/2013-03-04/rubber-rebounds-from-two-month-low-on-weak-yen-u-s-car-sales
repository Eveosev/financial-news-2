Rubber rebounded from the lowest
level in more than two months as a weaker Japanese currency
boosted the appeal of yen-based contracts and growth in U.S. car
sales raised speculation demand will grow for the commodity used
in tires.  The contract for delivery in August advanced as much as 1.2
percent to 287.4 yen a kilogram ($3,079 a metric ton) before
trading at 284.9 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:29
a.m. It fell to 282.7 yen in after-hours trading on March 1, the
lowest level since Dec. 21. Futures lost 5.7 percent this year.  Japan ’s currency declined to 93.73 per dollar after
Haruhiko Kuroda said a Bank of Japan under his leadership would
do whatever is needed to combat 15 years of deflation. U.S.
light-vehicle sales in February rose 3.7 percent to 1.19
million, heading for the best year since 2007, according to the
research company Autodata.  “Optimism about the U.S. growth and a weak yen gave
support to rubber futures,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at
research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Kuroda told a parliamentary hearing today on his nomination
as governor that the BOJ hasn’t bought enough assets to end
deflation. The opposition Democratic Party of Japan will approve
the appointment of Kuroda, Jiji reported, citing the party’s
secretary general. The Asian Development Bank president would
take office after Governor Masaaki Shirakawa retires March 19,
if confirmed by parliament.  The contract for September delivery on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange fell 0.6 percent to 23,825  yuan  ($3,825) a ton. Rubber
inventories rose 883 tons to 103,299 tons, the bourse said on
March 1, based on a survey of nine warehouses in Shanghai,
Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin.  Thai rubber  free-on-board dropped 0.5 percent to 88.75 baht
($2.98) a kilogram on March 1, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
