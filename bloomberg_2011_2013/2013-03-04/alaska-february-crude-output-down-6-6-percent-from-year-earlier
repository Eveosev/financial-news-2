Oil production in  Alaska ’s North
Slope dropped 6.6 percent in February from a year earlier as
output at existing wells declined and  BP Plc (BP/)  did maintenance on
wells in the Endicott and Lisburne fields.  Production  averaged 570,983 barrels a day last month, down
from 611,165 in  February 2012 , the state tax division said on
its website today.  January  output was 576,991 barrels a day.  BP Plc performed planned work last month in the Lisburne
and Endicott fields, Dawn Patience, a company spokeswoman in
Anchorage, said by e-mail. The maintenance at Endicott will
“continue into March,” she said.  Alaska’s North Slope has been yielding less oil every year
since 2002 as output from wells naturally declines and isn’t
replaced. The shrinking supply boosted foreign crude imports to
the U.S. West Coast and prompted Flint Hills Resources LLC to
shut a crude unit at the North Pole refinery last year because
of rising oil prices.  Output from Endicott averaged 9,613 barrels a day in
February, compared with 11,648 a year earlier. Production from
the Lisburne field was down 27 percent.  Inventories of the feedstock at the Valdez marine terminal,
the northernmost ice-free port in  North America , averaged 4.4
million barrels last month, ranging from a high of 5.7 million
on Feb. 24 to a low of 3.42 million on Feb. 1, according to the
tax division.  Several California refineries, including BP Plc’s Carson
plant and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s El Segundo site, performed planned
repairs on production units last month. California relies on
Alaska for about 12 percent of its  crude feedstock , according to
the state Energy Commission.  Alaska North Slope crude  prices declined 3.3 percent in
February, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The fuel’s  premium  to
U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate was unchanged at $16.25 a
barrel at 12:16 p.m.  New York  time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
