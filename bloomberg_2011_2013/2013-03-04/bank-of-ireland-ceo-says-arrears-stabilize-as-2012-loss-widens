Bank of Ireland Plc  Chief Executive
Officer Richie Boucher said mortgage arrears are stabilizing as
the nation’s largest bank by assets had a wider full-year loss.  The pretax loss widened to 2.2 billion euros ($2.8 billion)
from 190 million euros a year earlier, as one-time gains from
buying back junior bonds at a discount to par value in 2011
wasn’t repeated, the Dublin-based bank said in a statement
today. Excluding one-time items, pretax losses narrowed to 1.49
billion euros from 1.52 billion euros.  Boucher, 54, said he cut his workforce 9 percent to about
12,000 last year as he continued to shrink the bank’s loan book
and reliance on central bank funding. While the net interest
margin, the difference between the rate at which it borrows and
lends to customers, rebounded in the second half, he reiterated
that the goal of raising it to more than 2 percentage points by
end-2014 is challenging as interest rates remain low.  “There are definitely signs that the economy is starting
to grow again,” Boucher told reporters in Dublin after the
results. “There are definite signs in the bank that all the
work we’ve been putting in over the last four years is starting
to come through in financial numbers.”  ‘Impairment Charges’  The net-interest margin widened to 1.34 percent in the
second half from 1.20 percent in the previous six months, as the
bank cut deposit rates and raised borrowing costs. Deposits grew
to 75 billion euros at end-December from a year earlier, while
central bank reliance fell to 12 billion euros from 23 billion
euros, Boucher said.  Bank of Ireland’s loan loss charge fell to 1.72 billion
euros form 1.94 billion euros a year earlier, marking a third
straight year of decline.  “The impairment charges will continue to reduce from this
elevated level as the Irish economy recovers,” said Andrew Keating, chief financial officer.  By value, 9.9 percent of the bank’s Irish owner-occupier
mortgages were at least 90 behind in payments at the end of
December, up from 9.2 percent in June and 7.40 percent a year
earlier. Buy-to-let arrears rose to 23.4 percent in December
from 20.8 percent in June and 16.8 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
