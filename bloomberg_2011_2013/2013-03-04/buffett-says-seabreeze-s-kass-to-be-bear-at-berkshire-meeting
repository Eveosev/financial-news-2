Douglas Kass, founder of Seabreeze
Partners Management Inc., answered  Warren Buffett ’s call for
someone who’s bearish on  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  to ask
questions at the firm’s annual meeting.  Buffett selected Kass, the billionaire said in an interview
with CNBC today, after he wrote in his annual letter March 1
that he was looking for an investment professional who’s
negative on the stock, or betting on its decline, to ask
questions at the May 4 meeting for his Omaha, Nebraska-based
company.  Editor: Dan Kraut  To contact the reporter on this story:
