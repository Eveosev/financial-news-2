Global shipbuilding capacity is
about a third lower than it was at the 2008 peak as yards close
or reduce employment, RS Platou Economic Research said in a
monthly report.  Shipbuilding capacity is estimated at 35 million
compensated gross tons, more than needed in the next two years,
according to the Oslo-based research unit of  Norway ’s largest
shipbroker. Compensated gross tons is a formula used to measure
shipbuilding output.  “Under the prevailing market conditions, where
shipbuilders are forced to accept new contracts below cost
levels, we have seen a significant share of the building
capacity withdrawn or removed,” according to the report e-
mailed today.  Chinese yards tracked by the Oslo researcher gained from 22
in 2002 to 127 by 2011, and consolidation is anticipated, Platou
said.  The combined capacity of deliveries of  new ships  needs to
be lower than 35 million CGT a year to absorb an oversupply of
vessels in the merchant fleet, according to Platou. Deliveries
of new ships, each weighing more than 30,000 deadweight tons,
surged from 18 million CGT in 2002 to a peak of 44 million CGT
in 2011, led by a 13-fold boost in new ships built in  China ,
according to Platou.  To contact the reporter on this story:
